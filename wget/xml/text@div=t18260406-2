On the 8th of March, about a quarter past six o'clock in the afternoon, I saw these eight shirts hanging on a line in my front parlour to dry; they hung near the window, which was open - it was nearly dusk. I missed them about twenty minutes to seven. There is a garden in front of the house, which lays rather back from the road; a person could reach them with a stick, but not with their hands; there were marks of two persons' footsteps on the mould under the window; I cannot say whether they were men's or women's footsteps - I saw nobody about. I sent bills round to the pawnbrokers, and Lloyd produced one of the shirts to me; they belong to different gentlemen who I wash for - I cannot replace them for 6l. - The smallest footmark looked like a woman's shoe.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Strutton-ground, Westminster. On Thursday, the 9th of March, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to pawn this shirt, for 5s.; I observed the mark had been picked out, and asked her who it belonged to - she said her husband. She has pawned female apparel with me before. Having been informed of the robbery I gave her in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an unfortunate female. I met a man in the Broadway, who asked me to pawn this shirt, and to say it was my husband's, if they asked me.</p>

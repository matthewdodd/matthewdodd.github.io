I missed goods at times She had lived with me about seven or eight days. I told her I suspected she had broke them, and put them out of the way. She said, as they were lost since she had been in my service, she would pay me for them. I sent a servant to her lodging, and she returned with some of the things. Then I got a warrant for the prisoner, and found all the rest. (produced in court.) Here are all the goods mention'd in the indictment, except the tea kettle, which we left under the seat of the coach we came here in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Medley. She told me to go and enquire at a batcher's in Great St. Andrew's Holbourn, where they gave her a very good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present when you found the things in her lodging?</p>
               <p>Medley. No, she was not; she was sent to the Gatehouse. She was taken after that before the justice, and there she acknowledged she had taken away the things mentioned, and beg'd I'd forgive her, saying she'd be better for the future.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol; I mistrusted the prisoner; I thought the horse too good to be his; I asked him where he was going with that horse; the first word he answered me was, he was going to the horseboiler's, I told him I thought it was too good a horse for that, and that he did not come honestly by him, and then he said he was going to the Bull Inn in Bishopsgate-street; then I called one of my men to my assistance, and I walked down by the side of the man, and he told me where he had the horse from, he said he took him out of the field near the Green Man upon Finchley Common, and he had this string on his head.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise, if he would tell you the truth? - No, my Lord, I am sure of that; I was present when the prosecutor owned the horse; it was the same horse that I found upon the prisoner.</p>

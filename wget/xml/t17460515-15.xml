               <p>Pearse. No, my Lord. My Husband was here at Four o'Clock, but was obliged to go home. Sir he (the Prisoner) lodged at my House, but he never wronged me, which he might have done many a Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie at your House the Night before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Pearse. I did not know of it 'till the next Morning; he ne'er was out 'till Ten o'Clock all the Time he was at our House.</p>

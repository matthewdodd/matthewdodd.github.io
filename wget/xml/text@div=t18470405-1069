                  </hi> I live in Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road. On the 30th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was at a public-house at the corner of Cornwall-road—the two prisoners were there, and I treated them—I left the house—the prisoners followed me, and Slaney at<lb></lb>tempted to get up a fight in the street with another woman, who went away—this caused a confusion, and I asked a policeman to make way for me to pass—he made answer, and said, "I think you had better get home as fast as you can"—I accordingly got away as well as I could, and went into Mr. Fry's, another public-house, and by the time I got in, Slaney and another female had also got in—the policeman was also in, and he attempted to shut the door against a mob of people, one of whom was M' Lean, who was so determined to make an entrance into the house that the policeman could not keep the door closed—I went forwards to assist him to do so, but M' Lean effected an entrance—I laid my hand on his collar, and asked him what was the reason he followed me so pertinaciously into the house—we had a sort of scuffle, and went into a side-parlour—Slaney followed, and while I had my hand on M' Lean's shoulder I lost my watch, but I was not aware I had lost it till I heard a female witness, who is here, exclaim, "The gentleman has lost his watch"—the policeman immediately afterwards asked me if I had lost anything—I said, "Yes, my watch"—he said, "Is this it, sir?"—I said, "Yes, it is"—I do not know who it was took it—I know it was taken the moment after I got into Mr. Fry's house—M' Lean was before me, and Slaney at my back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing—this robbery took place about nine o'clock in the morning—I was at the first public-house about seven o'clock—I had been up the whole night—I had been at the London Tavern, and left there about two o'clock in the morning—I had been at a private house afterwards—I had not been into any public-houses drinking—I do not consider I was drunk at all—I consider I was quite sen<lb></lb>sible enough to know what I was about—I cannot say how long I had been at the public-house I was at; perhaps half an hour—I saw several persons there about—I was very near my own home, but I felt thirsty, and wanted a glass of stout—I took it alone—I did not get into any quarrel there—I did not per<lb></lb>ceive any persons follow me out, but I found it was so—they got up a sham fight in the street—they appeared to get up the fight amongst themselves—I do not know whether it was sham or earnest—that was about nine o'clock—I then went into another public-house, to get away from those people—I went to Mr. Fry's because I knew him—it would have been further to have gone home—the policeman advised me to go home—I did not go because I did not choose to be followed by the mob—I laid my hand on M'Lean's collar when he entered the house—he was pushing against me at the time—he was pushing in with a great number of others—one policeman was inside the house with me.</p>

                  </hi> I live in New-street, Webber-street. About quarter-past nine, or half-past nine, that morning the prosecutor came into Mr. Fry's, the Cobourg Arms—he came into the bar-parlour, and asked to be allowed to sit there to get away from Slaney, who was following him—during that time the policeman came in and tried to prevent the mob from coming in—M' Lean</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184704050157"></xptr>
               <p>endeavoured to force himself in, and he got one arm and one leg in—he forced himself in with a number of other persons, and the prosecutor went into the little parlour; M'Lean followed him in, and Slaney directly made a grasp at the prosecutor's breast and took his watch—M'Lean was behind him—just as Slaney took his watch M'Lean put his hand on his shoulder, and went back on the chair—I had seen the prosecutor before, and I said "Don't take his pin"—I said to him, "Where is your pin?" and he said "Where is my watch?"—I said, "Slaney took it, and the officer has got it"—I thought M'Lean put his hand to take his pin—he pulled him back, and the chair took him and prevented his falling—the prosecutor said a few minutes after<lb></lb>ward that he had not lost his pin—the policeman took the remainder of the guard form the prosecutor's neck.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you a friend of the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am a charwoman, and go out to work—I had occasionally seen the prosecutor come in—I saw these people endeavouring to force their way into the house—the prosecutor appeared quite sober—I did not see him collar M'Lean—I saw the people forcing their way in, and saw everything that took place—after that I turned round—I did not see the prosecutor touch M 'Lean at all—I did not see him collar him—when M 'Lean was forcing his way in, the prose<lb></lb>cutor did not collar him—I heard him ask him what he wished for.</p>

About half-past nine that morn<lb></lb>ing I saw the prosecutor amongst a number of persons—the prisoners were there—they followed him from the Pear Tree in the New-cut, and Slaney struck another female—I persuaded the prosecutor to go home, seeing he had a gold chain—he said he would go to Mr. Fry's, as he knew him—when I got to Mr. Fry's Slaney got in—I endeavoured to keep M 'Lean out, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor came to my assistance—M'Lean got in, and they went into the parlour together—I put the chain on the door, and went into the parlour—I took this watch from Slaney's hand—the prosecutor was in a leaning position—Slaney was behind him and M'Lean before him—I had the doors closed, sent for more assistance, and took the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hackney. - On the 5th of February, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Church-street, Hackney, driving two pigs; I asked where he brought them from; he said from Waltham Abbey - that he received them from a man named Williams, who met him, and asked him to drive them to Spitalfields; I asked what part of Spitalfields he was taking them to - he could not inform me; I said that was singular; he then said he was to meet the person at Cambridge-heath, and was to have half-a-crown for driving them there; I asked at what time he left Waltham Abbey; he said about three o'clock, or between two and three; it is more than ten miles from Hackney. I said I must take him into custody - he said if he was allowed to go to Cambridge-heath he should meet the man - that he was a butcher, and he had known him a long while; I locked him up, and went to Cambridge-heath in about two hours; I inquired of the turnpike man if any person had been inquiring about two pigs, but could not learn that any one had - I also inquired at the Clapton gate, but could get no intelligence. I did not inquire at the public-houses. Marsh claimed the pigs, as his master's, next day. Snaresbrook is six or seven miles from Waltham Abbey, and not in the direct road; he said he met Williams at Waltham Abbey, at three o'clock that afternoon, and it being impossible for him to have come so far, made me stop him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I received them in the Lea-bridge road, which is in the direct road from Waltham Abbey? A. He said they were given to him in the middle of Waltham Abbey town - that he knew Waltham Abbey perfectly well, and received them there; I asked which way he came; he said through Lea-bridge turnpike; I inquired, and found he had come through that gate, and left his apron to pay the toll, and had stated that he had driven them from Waltham Abbey.</p>

            . I keep an inn at Snaresbrook, which is not in the direct road from Waltham Abbey to Hackney. I know Mr. Scratton's two pigs; I drove them out of my yard on to the forest at ten minutes before eleven o'clock on the 5th of February. I saw them in Cowling's possession next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man at Lea-bridge, who appeared to be a butcher; he said his name was Williams- that he was going to Spitalfields, and would give me 2s. 6d. to drive them, and he would meet me at Cambridge-heath, and if any one asked where I was going I was to say to Mr. Williams, of Spitalfields; they were delivered to me between two and three o'clock.</p>

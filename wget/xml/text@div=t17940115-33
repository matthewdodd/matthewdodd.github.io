               <p>The way that I was robbed the prisoner had no place to sleep in, and I gave him a room to sleep in, and bedding for to sleep on. On the 28th of November at night he went up and down three times, the last time he went out about one o'clock at night, and did not come back, and I missed a shirt, a neck handkerchief, a pair of trowsers and seven shillings and six-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose them from? - I was asleep at that time, the things were lost from the two pair of stairs, my own room.</p>

               <p>I know that same evening before the robbery was, I met the prisoner without either a shirt, I met him in Upper East Smithfield, the prosecutor and the prisoner were both together, it was within a few doors of their house, this prisoner had neither a shirt or handkerchief, nothing but an old bit of a smock frock on; when he was taken, which was the 8th of December, he had the handkerchief on, that I had given this Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him taken? - I did, and got the officer to take charge of him, because of the handkerchief that he had on, which I swore to before justice Wickam, and the shirt I knew that was on him at the time he was taken, to be Mr. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner sleeping at Brown's? - The land lady of the house knows he was there, and Mr. Brown came and told me.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; took the prisoner on the 8th of December last, I found on him this shirt and handkerchief.</p>


               <p>Q. How came you to take him up? - I was sent for, I asked him how he came by the shirt and handkerchief? he said Mr. Brown gave them to him for doing some work for him; I asked him what he did with the trowsers and money? he said he knew nothing about the remainder of the things, but this shirt and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did you ever give the prisoner any of these things? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the things to put on, he expected that his wife had given me something for some work I had done for them; as for the trowsers and money I know nothing about them.</p>

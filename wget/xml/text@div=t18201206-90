             are churchwardens. I went to the church about two o'clock in the morning of the 1st of July, and found the front door on the south-side unlocked - the bolt of the lock was not sprung. I went and called the sexton, we went into the church, and found it was robbed of its cloth. I went again with the clerk, and found the vestry door open, and the surplice gone - the church door did not appear to be forced open. I supposed it must have been opened by a key.</p>

            . I am the sexton. I was called up, and went to the church; the black cloth was taken from the pulpit, desk, communion-table, and Lord Lisburne's pew, about sixty yards in all. I found two small pieces of candle, and some matches. I had locked the south door at nine o'clock the night before. I turned the key twice, as usual, a surplice was taken from the vestry-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You cannot recollect whether you tried the door - A. No. I always turn the key twice, and recollect doing so this night - the vestry is in front of the church; it has an outer door, it is used for parish meetings; the communion-plate, and things belonging to the church are kept there.</p>

            . On the morning of the 1st of July I was coming in the waggon to town. At twenty minutes past two o'clock I was near the Two Brewers, at Ponder's End, between eight or nine miles from town. A man dressed in blue or black came up, and asked if I would take a bundle as far as Shoreditch Church for him, and he would give me 1 s. I said; he might lay it on the shafts; he had none with him. He said, my mate or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060035"></xptr>mates are just by. He went on the other side of the road. A man in a grey coat then came up with a bag, he spoke to the man in black, the man in grey gave me the bag, and I put it on the shafts, and the man in black or blue gave me a bundle tied in a silk handkerchief. I had not seen the two in conversation; the one in grey asked me to give him the whip, and said he would drive. I went to sleep in the waggon, and when I awoke I found myself at Tottenham-cross; the man in grey was still driving. I then got up, and looked about, and saw two other men besides the one driving; one was in black and one in blue; they were walking together about six roods behind. The man in blue was Webb, who was tried last Sessions. It was then light. I remained awake. After this I took the whip, the man who drove joined the other two, and all walked together, and on this side of Stamford-hill the man in a dark coat got a nosegay from a garden. I had not seen the man in blue from Ponder's End to Tottenham. I there saw him with some flowers in his arms; the man in a black coat then went into a garden and fetched a handful of flowers out. I had seen the man in blue with flowers before. I came on to Kingsland. Mead met me just at the crescent; he spoke privately to me - the man in a black coat then came up, and asked what he had been saying to me. I said, he came to see whether I had a letter from his mother. He said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know him?" I said, No. He said,</p>
               <p>"Where does he come from?" I said, "I do not know; I believe he came from Cambridgeshire;" he put his hand into his pocket, gave me 1 s., crossed the road, and I saw no more of him. I saw him talking to Webb. He said nothing when he gave me 1 s.; it was about five o'clock when he left.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say if you know him - A. That is the man that was at Worship-street, but I cannot say whether he was one. He is not the man in grey or blue. The man who gave me the 1 s. had large whiskers, dark or black. He had yellow top-boots. I went towards town - the other two went on till I got to the Coach and Horses, about two hundred yards from the church. Mead remained - I stopped at the Coach and Horses, and told them to take their parcels off - the man in grey went round to the off side of the horses, and Webb came on the near side next the shafts, and ran back by me. He was pursued and taken; the man in grey got away. Mead took the bundles.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was examined against Webb - A. Yes. He had yellow top boots. I should know the man in grey if I saw him. It was a man in a dark coat that came to ask me to carry the bundles - whether it was the one in blue or black I cannot say. The one in black paid me - he left just by Kingsland workhouse; he was nearer to me than the others, and talked to me more than they did. They all put their hands through the railings and gathered flowers.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q, Can you say whether Webb was one of the two you first saw at Ponder's End - A. I cannot; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man in black or not.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Enfield. I sat out at three o'clock in the morning after the men suspected of the robbery. The church is a mile and a half or two miles from Ponder's End. I got information, which led me from Shoreditch church towards Stamford-hill. I met the waggon; three men were walking about three yards behind the waggon, the prisoner was one of them - he is very much altered since, but I am certain he was one of them - he had a black coat, kerseymere or corded breeches, and top boots. I will not be positive about his waistcoat. I recollected that I had some knowledge of him before, but I could not recollect where. Webb, the man in blue, had a nosegay. As soon as I came up I spoke to the waggoner, and arranged something between us. I kept my eye on the three men. The one who is not taken came up and spoke to me as soon as I left the waggon. I do not think the others could hear what he said. He went back to them, and was in conversation sometime; then the man in grey came up again, and talked for a great distance, then turned round to the prisoner and the other, and said,</p>
               <p>"Shall we take our luggage off here?" Something was said by one of them, but what it was I do not know. I told the waggoner to pull his horses on faster, and not let them take their luggage off there; he smacked his whip and the horses went faster. The prisoner put his hand into his pocket, I saw him give the waggoner a piece of silver money, and then went away across the road, I saw no more of him. The waggon went on to the Coach and Horses, the other two following it, walking and talking together - I was within a few yards of them all the time. When we got opposite the Mail Coach, public-house, I told the waggoner to stop, and let them take their luggage off there. Webb came on the near side, and the other on the off side. I ran round, and secured the man who is now at large - I gave him to another, and then went and took Webb. The man in grey got away from the other person. Before I got up to Webb he turned round and threw a nosegay away and a bunch of picklock keys, which I picked up. On searching him I found an iron crow bar, a knife, and a box with some tinder in it - they were produced on Webb's trial and left here - also some small pieces of wax candle, some pieces of matches, and a steel. There was also a needle, with a small piece of packthread in it. I compared the candle with others found in the church, they appeared alike. I got the bundles from the waggon, they contained cloth and a surplice. The bag was directed on a card, tacked on with packthread - I compared it with that found on Webb, they appeared alike. I have searched diligently for the prisoner ever since, but could not find him till I saw him at Worship-street. When I saw him on the 1st of July he had very large black whiskers, coming down nearly to the corner of his mouth, which makes a great alteration in his appearance - they are now cut off, but I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before - A. I must have seen him before. I think I have seen him at a cricket-match on Chace-green, with a little girl seven, eight, or nine years old. I was in the habit of passing the house he lived in eight or ten times a day, and am certain I must have seen him before, or I should not know his person so well. I cannot say where I have seen him before, but it must have been about Enfield. I did not know he lived at Enfield till after the robbery. I first saw the waggon within a mile of Shoreditch church. When I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060036"></xptr>him at Worship-street Armstrong had apprehended him; I saw him come out of a hackney coach with another person, chained together. I knew the man charged with this offence was coming - he was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 1st of July you recollected having seen him before, but where you did not know - A. Yes, my Lord, it did not occur to me that I had seen him at Enfield. I met the waggon at five o'clock, it was light. I was just before him all the time. I frequently looked back, to see if they were in conversation together. I had come a different road to Shoreditch church, and returned that way.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARE. I am a fishmonger, and live at Enfield. On the morning of the 1st of July I was going to town for fish with Tuck, and about the four-mile stone from town I overtook Hemmingway, in company with Webb, a waggon was then before me; they were about one hundred yards behind it, going in the same direction. Webb had a bunch of roses in his hand. I asked the prisoner, in a joke, where he had been to, thieving all night? I cannot say what answer he gave.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Webb then - A. I had seen him one Sunday at Enfield with the prisoner. There is now a great alteration in the prisoner's appearance. When I saw him following the waggon he had very large dark whiskers, which came down towards his mouth - I had always seen him so at Enfield; he is now much thinner. He lodged opposite to me for a fortnight at Mrs. Wind's - his child was at Trundle's. I have seen him two or three times every day - his whiskers were always in that state. I have seen him on the cricket-ground with his child. On the 1st of July he was dressed in a black coat, striped waistcoat, corded breeches, and top boots.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him when you met him - A. Yes, I only saw him with Webb once before, on a Sunday. I was not examined on Webb's trial; I was not wanted. I never saw the prisoner after the 1st of July - I went to look for him. I went to Newgate, to see if the man taken was the same that I saw on the road, as I did not see him at the office.</p>

            . I live at Enfield - it is my duty to take care of the clock at the church; I have to wind it up. I had the prisoner's child to take care of; it was brought on the 16th of April, and taken away on the first Monday in July, after the church was robbed - his sister and another woman took it away. The prisoner has wound up the clock for me about three times - I was always with him. I only have the key of the tower. There is a hole in the belfry, which they call through to stop the bell - I believe it looks into the church. I did not see him after the Wednesday before the robbery, which was on Saturday. He had not told me the child was to be fetched away - it is about nine years old - he frequently took it a walk. Webb came down with the prisoner one Sunday for a day's pleasure, about three weeks after I received the child. There is an alteration in the prisoner's appearance, which I was much shocked at when I saw him at the office, and he has not so much whiskers as when he came to see his child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not said you wished the child to be taken away - A. When I heard of this business I did, that it might not come on the parish. The woman who came with her sister to fetch it had the care of it before.</p>

            . I have compared the cloth produced by Mead with a piece left in the church, and attached to the pulpit, it matched - there were two or three pieces; also the surplice, which is marked EP. No. 1, for Enfield parish. The vicar claims the cloth. I had the key of the vestry, and locked it on the 30th of June, at the time I locked the north door. The surplice was bought and paid for by the churchwardens.</p>

            . I saw Webb pursued by Mead and others. When he came in contact with me he threw some flowers away, and afterwards two double and one single skeleton keys. I tried them to the church door, none of them opened it, but one opened the vestry door very easily.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am a constable of Worship-street. I first went in search of the prisoner about a fortnight before he was apprehended - I tried all I could to find him. On the night of the 5th of November I saw him, and asked him how he was? he said very well. We went over to a public-house and had a glass of beer. I then told him I took him for robbing Enfield church with Webb, who was under sentence, he said he knew nothing about it. I asked him if he knew Webb? he said he did not know him, but he might have read of his name. I asked him if he was not in company with

               <p>"Have you anything about you?" he said he had. I found he had a crow-bar, matches, tinder, some tobacco, and a knife. I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the bill thrown out against the prisoner the first time - A. Yes, because Hare and two other persons were not called in. I have known him eight or nine years, he had a very good character, but I know nothing of him for the last year.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and the prisoner's brother. I remember Enfield church being robbed. I think it was on a Saturday. I live at Low Leighton - I heard of the robbery on the Tuesday following. On the night the church was robbed my brother was at Potter's Bar, three miles from Barnet. I was with him - we got there between four and five in the morning, - we went to my brother's house, who was ill at the time, we went down to see him; we sat out with Hunt from Low Leighton, and went to Potter's Bar. I should think it is between thirteen and fourteen miles from Low Leighton. We walked all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your brother get down to you in the morning - A. I think between twelve and one o'clock When we got to Potter's Bar we first went to my brother Joseph, and staid there all the evening till, as near as I can guess, a quarter after two o'clock in the morning, my brother was in bed when we got there, we all three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060037"></xptr>came away together, and parted at Tottenham-high-cross, it struck four o'clock as we came through Tottenham church yard, we came across Southgate, It was light when we parted.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How far is Enfield church from Potter's Bar - A. I think they reckon it five miles. It is a good road. Hunt came here to-day with my brother and I. My brother had a violent cold, and a rash broke out, and also a bad arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you stop so late with a sick man? A. I went to stop all the next day, but my business would not let me. When we had seen my brother we all three went to the Duke of York, public-house, Galley-corner, and got there about eight o'clock. We had some bread and cheese at my brother's, who fetched it from the White Hart. We had four or five pots of beer at the public-house. I saw nobody particular there. It is about one mile from Potter's Bar, on the road to town. We stopped there till a quarter to ten o'clock, then returned to my brother's, and stopped there till a quarter to two o'clock. We had no refreshment there. Webb returned from the public-house, his wife was up mending shirts, stockings, and shifts. A young man named Oney, came in there about twelve o'clock, and stopped about ten minutes, he came to wish us good by. He keeps a horse and cart, and was going to town with a load of hay. I told him we going to town.</p>
               <p>Q. As there was a public-house near your brother's, why did you go to the Duke of York - A. An old shoemaker named Denham, lived there, and I wished to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live last July - A. That I cannot say. He has lived over the water within the last twelve months. I think three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Were you in the habit of going frequently to Potter's Bar - A. Now and then. I should not have gone if he had not written to me, as he wanted us to get him into the hospital.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Low Leighton from London - A. Five miles. I got home about a quarter after five o'clock, went to my business in Mr. Drake's garden, and worked there all day.</p>

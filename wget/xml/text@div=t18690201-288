                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and live at 7, James Street, Marlborough Road, Chelsea—this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I first saw in the possession of Striemer—he showed it to me—I could not say the date, I think it was about the commencement of September—it was at the European Tavern—I had told him that I was in want of an accommodation bill for a friend, and he then produced, the bill—I told him I would show it to my friend, Mr. Templeton—at that time there was no other endorsement on it than "Byron, Beale &amp; Co."—Striemer told me the bill did not belong to him—I did not give him anything for it then; I ultimately gave him not quite 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the bill with me and showed it to Templeton, and ap<lb></lb>pointed a meeting with Striemer next day—I met him next day at a public-house in Sherborne Lane, I don't know the name of it—I brought the bill back to him and told him that my friend thought he could do with it, that it would answer his purpose, but that he did not wish to pay for it until he knew that he could make use of it—Striemer said he could not give up the bill on those conditions; that he had to pay a certain amount, whether the bill was used or not—I told him that I should get a friend of mine to endorse the bill, and wanted him to put that, down or get the endorsement upon it—the endorsement was there in blank—he did according to my instructions; he took the bill away and got this put in: "Pay to order," and I got the signature of "Lawrence &amp; Dogoroff"—they were merchants in Thames Street at that time—the stamp was on it before Striemer told me that he had to give 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to his party, whether the bill was used or not—I agreed to give him that, and told him that Mr. Templeton had promised me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble, and that I would share that with him—at the time I received the bill from him I gave him, I think, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and after<lb></lb>wards further sums, amounting altogether to not quite 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave the bill to Mr. Templeton—I received a smell cheque from him before I handed him the bill; I am not sure whether it was for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had two cheques from him, and I don't know which it was he gave me on that occasion.</p>

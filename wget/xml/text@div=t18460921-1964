                  </hi>. I am a law stationer, and live in Castle—street, Holborn. On the 21st of Aug. I played "Richard the Third", in a private theatrical performance, at the Bower Saloon in Stangate—street—I believe it is a licensed theatre—when I went to play I took one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which were in my pocket, and transferred them from my own clothes to my theatrical pantaloons, which I had on—the prisoner acted as prompter—I lost my property that night—I took off the pantaloons about ten o'clock that night, and threw them from the dressing—room, in which I had been dressed, into another dressing—room, and my impression is that I omitted taking the money out of the pantaloons—one of the notes has been traced—the prisoner was with me part of the time when I undressed—I do not know what became of him when I threw the pantaloons over—if I see the notes I can identify them—here is one with the name of "Butcher and Son" on it, in my writing—here is another with the same writing on it—these are two of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and this is the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which is also mine.</p>

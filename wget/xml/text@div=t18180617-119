            , JUN. I live in Cumming-street, Pentonville. On the 17th of June, about two o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18180617-119-crimeloc665">Edward-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18180617-119-crimeloc665" type="placeName" value="Edward-street"></interp>

When I was about the middle I found the crowd so great that I was obliged to turn, and go with it. I felt somebody press very hard upon me; at the same moment my coat was lifted up. I looked round cautiously, and observed the prisoner take his hand from my pocket. I tried to catch hold of him - He shrunk back as far as he could, and nearly fell to the ground. At that instant I heard something fall on the pavement, which sounded like metal. I immediately seized him, suspecting he had taken my box - I missed it out of my coat pocket. It was given to me by a person near me. I am certain the prisoner's hand came from my pocket.</p>

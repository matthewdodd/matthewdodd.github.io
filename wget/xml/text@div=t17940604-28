            After you had placed this shilling on the table which you supposed to be a bad one, what did you next do? - He offered me another shilling, which I tried and found that to be a bad one also, and I laid that down; a neighbour's child was in the house, and I desired her to fetch her mother to look at the money; she came, and the woman was going to give it to the prisoner, but I desired her to give it me till he had paid me; he said he did not think they were bad, he had taken them that morning at a pawnbroker's near London-bridge, that he had pawned his coat there; the man asked me if I was going to give him his money? I told him when he paid me there was his money, he then went outside of the door and returned again in a minute, and asked me if I intended to give him his money? and I told him when he paid me he should have it, he then said it is but two-pence halfpenny, no, says I, it is no more; and he threw down two-pence halfpenny in halfpence, I then returned him his money, the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040047"></xptr>shillings and two six-pences; he then looked at them and said, that he had taken them at a pawnbroker's, but, says he, here is one of these shillings that you have changed, I said I believed them all to be bad, and he said that was a bad one that I had changed, he then throwed the money down on the table which he said I had changed, and told me I should stand to the consequences of it the next day, I left it laying on the table, a man came in, and I was saying I never was served such a trick before in my life; he took it up and looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that shilling? - The constable has got it, he had it delivered to him about an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it delivered to the constable? - No, I did not, I delivered it to a young man, Mr. Pollard a nephew of Mr. Borton's.</p>

               <p>Q.

Says I to him, is this your shilling? no, says he, they have changed my shilling. Says I, have you got any more? he shewed me another shilling, and that was a bad one; and then I asked him if he had got any more? he said, he had a six-pence, and that was a bad one; I told him to go along me, I would see him righted, and I took him to Hatton-garden, and when the magistrates sat, they said, that I must take him to the City, and give him up to the first City officer I found; and I met one in Fleet-market, and I gave him the money, and delivered up the prisoner to him, his name is

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I am a poor distressed man, not able to see a counsel nor capable of speaking in my own defence, I never was brought before a court of justice before, and therefore humbly hope that as your Lordship is my judge, that you will also humanely become my advocate. I had three sons, in London, and wishing to live with my children, I came from Ireland about eleven months ago, and found, when I arrived,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040048"></xptr>that one of my sons were dead, and the other was gone on board of man of war; I was obliged to get my living by labouring work, and I had been our of work for some days, when this unfortunate affair happened, on which day I had but one and nine-pence left, and being resolved to go into the country to seek for work, I pledged a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, for five shillings, to have something to support me till I could get into employ, as may appear from the pawnbroker's duplicate; when I got the money from the pawnbroker's I had not the least suspicion of any being bad, nor can I from the dimness of my sight be able to distinguish a good shilling from a bad one. I called at a public house near the pawnbroker's for a pint of beer, and the landlord said the shilling I offered him was a bad one, and I went and changed it at the pawnbroker's, who gave me another, I afterwards called at this cook shop, and had two-penny halfpennyworth of meat and bread, and gave a six-pence to pay for it, which they said was bad, I then gave another, which was likewife refused, and words arose, and they forcibly took what money I had from me; the next day I was brought before an alderman, and the people appeared and produced the money, I could not hear what the people said; but I am since told that I had eighteen-pence bad among the money; I cannot pretend to say whether the pawnbroker gave me the bad money, or whether these people themselves might not change it. This is my real distressing cafe, which I humbly submit to your lordship's penetration; I have been now six weeks confined, and I humbly hope that your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, will take my cafe into consideration, and acquit me.</p>

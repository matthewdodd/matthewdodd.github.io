                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Eagle-street, City-road. My brother-in-law, Thomas Paine, then kept the house—the prisoner was his servant—I had a clothes-box in my bed-room, containing two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and other notes, in a handkerchief at the top of my clothes—I have the numbers of them—I locked the box on the 16th of Nov., and put the key into my pocket—I opened it again on the 18th—my money was safe then—I shut it again, and, as I thought, locked it; but I afterwards found that the hasp had not caught, and locked it that night without examining my money—on the 20th, I unlocked</p>

               <p>it, and missed two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from the handkerchief—the rest of the money was there—I told my sister of my loss, and asked the prisoner if she had seen any thing of value in my room—she said she had not—I went for a police<lb></lb>man—I could not find one, and when I returned, there was a policeman in the house—I saw two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in his hand, Nos. 77, 201, and 77, 204—I never said that I might have had the notes out, and mislaid them—I am sure I did not mislay them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Payne, who kept the house, 27, Eagle-street. The prosecutor, who is my brother, slept in a bed-room on the staircase near the kitchen—the prisoner was in my service three weeks and three or four days—on Sunday, the 20th of Nov., my brother complained of missing some money—I went to the kitchen, and told the prisoner that my brother complained of losing some notes, and asked her if she had them, which she denied—I said, I knew she had them; if she would give them up, I would forgive her—she first said that the young man had mislaid them—she afterwards complained of wanting to go to the water-closet—I went with her, and then repeated the question, and said, "If you give them up, you shall be forgiven"—she did not answer—I said it was useless for her to try to disguise them, for as soon as she was searched, the cesspool would be searched—she said, "What, search this place?"—I said, "Yes"—she then took the notes from her bosom, gave them to me, and said she had found them behind the box.</p>

I am a journeyman carpenter and live at 7, St. Stephens Square, Kent Street, Borough—on 28th March, I had been to visit my sister and was returning home about 12.30 on the morning of the 29th—as I was going through Kent Street I saw a group of five or six men, and the prisoner was standing against the wall, about a couple of yards from them—as I was about to pass the prisoner threw a cloth over my shoulder—he had a knife in his right-hand, and he put his thumb under my throat and said "Here is a b----that I will shave"—he took my hat—I tried to get away—I took off the prisoner's hat—I called police, and the constable Flint came up—Hill was a little way behind—the prisoner was holding me when Flint came up—I asked Flint to take him—he said "What must I take him for"—I said "He has robbed me of my hat and tried to choke me"—Flint took him by the right-hand and said "You must come with me to the station"—he said he would not go—he resisted and there was a scuffle—the other men had hold of me—the prisoner said to Flint "I would not go with forty such b----as you"—the struggle continued and the prisoner threw Flint down—he tried to get up and the prisoner kicked and beat him about—Hill came up and took hold of the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 26). Between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 29th March, I was on duty in Kent Street—I heard cries of "Police!" and went to the spot with Hill—I saw the prisoner holding Harding by the coat, and he also was holding a cloth up to his throat, and Harding said "Leave go, you are choking me"—the prisoner had a knife open in his hand—he saw me and released Harding, who said he had been robbed of his hat and nearly choked—I said "How was it"—he said as he was passing down Kent Street, the prisoner threw the cloth over his face almost choking him, and also stole his hat—I asked him if he wished to charge him, he said "Yes, I do"—I asked him a second time, and he said "Yes, I should think I would, I will come"—I took the prisoner by his right arm and said "You will have to go to the station with me"—we walked about three yards when the prisoner stopped—I said "You might as well go quietly, you will have to go"—he said "Not for forty such b----as you," at the same time he caught hold of me by the cape strap—I had my great coat and cape on—then caught hold of the prisoner by a silk hankerchief he had round his neck—he had the knife open in his hand then—he said "Leave go you b----or I will kill you"—he struggled and struck me a blow on the left shoulder with his right hand—we both fell—I felt for my truncheon, and I caught hold of someone's hand in the act of drawing it out—when I went up, there were five or six roughs there—I knew them very well—the hand let go, and I drew my truncheon and struck the prisoner on the arm with the wrong end—he still struggled, and almost choked me with my cape—I struck him several times on the arm—the roughs closed round us and we fell to the ground again—the prisoner snatched my truncheon, and threw it into the midst of the crowd—he called on the roughs and said "Let the b----have it"—the other constable was on the ground then thrown by the mob—about half-a-dozen of them made a rush, and the prisoner got away—whilst I was on the ground the second time I was kicked and rolled about in the mud for yards—the prisoner ran across to a lodging-house which his father keeps, No. 12, Kent street—I followed and caught him as he was entering the door, but his father came out and pulled the prisoner away and forced me back from the door and would not allow me to go in—he said "You shan't go over our house without a warrant"—we sprung our rattles and</p>

               <p>other constables arrived—we forced our way through the passage into the back yard and found the prisoner in some premises in the rear—he was; brought out and taken to the station—I was exhausted then—Mr. Evans the surgeon saw me, and I had a wound on the left shoulder where the prisoner had struck me—I produce my coat and cape and under coat—there are holes cut right through—my cape was cut all to pieces—there was only one hole in the coat on the shoulder where he struck me—I was bruised in several parts of the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Wheat sheaf public-house in Marylebone. On Monday, 4th October, the prisoner came to my bar about 10 o'clock—she asked for half-a-quartern of gin, and gave me a half-crown—I directly saw it was bad—I told her so, and put it to my teeth—she told me not to bend it as she knew where she took it—it was very soft—I gave it her back—she did not drink the gin—she went away and did not return. About 8 o'clock in the evening I saw her again at the same place—she was served with a pint of beer by Mr. Greaves the landlord—she paid for it with a good sixpence—a policeman came in there for her.</p>

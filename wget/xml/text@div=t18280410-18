               <p>JAMES GALLETLY. I live at Chiswick. I was at the Barley Mow public-house on Saturday night, the 22d of March; I called there to have a pint of beer, about ten o'clock: I had a pint of beer, and came off towards <placeName id="t18280410-18-crimeloc124">Chiswick</placeName>

I was near the Duke of Devonshire's grounds; before I went down to go there, I met the watchman, and asked what o'clock it was: he said he was going to cry half-past ten o'clock: I parted with him, went on, and put my stick against the pales while I stopped for a necessary purpose; I unbuttoned my small clothes, and while in that situation some person or persons, unknown to me, came up - I cannot say whether there was more than one, but some person or persons, unknown to me, left me for dead, and robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, did they come at the back of you, or by your side? A. I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any blow? A. I recollect nothing but coming to myself afterwards; I felt nothing that I recollect- I remember nothing whatever that happened; I was senseless of every thing - I had 9s. in one pocket, and 7s. in the other, when I paid for my beer and some seeds:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100021"></xptr>when I came to myself my pockets were turned inside out, except the left hand one, where I had the 7s. and seeds - the 7s. were gone, but the seeds left; all my money was gone, and the change, which I had out of my beer, was taken from my waistcoat pocket; when I came to myself, I scrambled up as well as I could, and went back to the Barley Mow, which is not above two hundred yards; they saw the situation I was in, and took me over to Mr. Cox, the surgeon - two young men, who were at the house, went home with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour did you first leave the public-house? A. I met the watchman as he was going to cry half-past ten o'clock - I did not look at my watch before I left the house, but when I rolled round, and was going to put up my breeches, my watch dropped into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a watch about you - was it in view? A. No; it was inside my inner trousers. I had a pint of beer - two or three persons drank out of the pint with me; I did not see the prisoner at the public-house, not to my knowledge - I have known his father and mother these forty years; I have not known him since he was a boy.</p>

            . I keep the Barley Mow, which is in the neighbourhood of Turnham-green. I know the prosecutor - he lives about a quarter of a mile from me. On the 22d of March, about ten o'clock in the evening, I remember seeing him at my house, and I saw Brown, the prisoner, there; I had known him some time - I did not see the prosecutor go away, nor did I see Brown go out; I do not know which went out first, nor did I know they were gone till I saw the prosecutor come back - the prisoner was not then in the house; the prosecutor came back near a quarter before eleven o'clock, and had a very bad cut in his head - I cannot say whether there was more than one cut - I could not see for his hair; he said he had been robbed, and went to a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor drinking there? A. He had one pint of beer; I saw him drinking at the table where Brown was in company; I did not observe him sit down at the table where Brown was, but he was asked to drink by some of the party - who it was I do not know; I had drank something myself that night, certainly: I saw Daniel Hearn there that night - he went for the surgeon; I saw him drink with the prosecutor that night - I did not observe anybody else drink with him; they might drink with him - there was plenty of light in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who helped him to the surgeon's? A. Daniel Hearn went with him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Turnham-green. I know the prosecutor very well, and remember seeing him on Saturday, the 22d of March, at the back of the King's-road, near the Duke of Devonshire's new road; I was calling half-past ten o'clock; he said, "Half-past - how much?" I told him half-past ten; he passed me - I was going along by the Barley Mow, and he was going towards Chiswick; I saw the prisoner standing by the Barley Mow door - I knew him very well before, and am sure he is the man - he was smoking his pipe at the door; I left him there, and went by him; I did not see him again till nearly half-past one o'clock the same night, when Reynolds, the officer, brought him to me underneath the gas-light; they showed me his smock-frock which he had got on - there was blood on it - it appeared to me to be wet; I said, "Brown, I think you have done something for yourself," and told him his hands were all over blood, as I saw they were so; he said nothing to that: I went with him to the watch-house; the officer took the smock-frock off his back - it is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you saw him standing at the door, did he see you? A. Yes; he knew me to be a watchman; I mentioned before the Magistrate about his hands being bloody; when I saw him smoking he had nothing in his hands but his pipe - he called me Joey; I bade him good night, and went round my beat; the prosecutor had been gone three or four minutes when I saw the prisoner at the door - I did not take the prisoner's hand in mine.</p>
               <p>Q. By the gas-light it appeared as if it had blood on it? A. Yes it was blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there had been blood previously dried, and any beer or water had fallen on his hands, would it not then have the appearance of fresh blood? A. I do not know, but I know it was blood.</p>

            . I was at the public-house on the night in question, and remember seeing the prosecutor there - I knew him before; and I saw the prisoner there; I saw the prosecutor move from his seat, and go out of the tap-room door; the prisoner remained in the house for a few minutes after that, and then I saw him go out; I remained in the house, and the prosecutor came back about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the prisoner went out - he came back with a large cut in his head, and said somebody had knocked him down and robbed him, but he did not know who.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the prisoner went out, had he anything in his hand? A. No; Galletly had a large stick; I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand - they did not drink together that night; I did not hear them ask each other to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that they asked each other to drink, and that they did so? A. No, I did not; I was before the Magistrate - I had been drinking myself; I had perhaps two or three pints of half and half, half beer and half ale - I was not at all intoxicated, nor was my memory affected at all, nor my spirits exhilerated in the least; I had been there perhaps two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was just two or three minutes after the prosecutor that the prisoner went out? A. Because I took particular notice; old Galletly said good night, the prisoner did not say good night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Will you swear the prisoner went out about three minutes after him? A. Yes, I have said it might be a minute more or less than three minutes; I never said they went out together - I swear I never did; I drank very little that night, it might be a pint of beer, or a pint and half, that would not affect my head at all; I was before the Magistrate on the Monday, and on the Monday week, but never said they went out together - I have been in this Court before and at the bar.</p>

            . I am constable and patrol of Chiswick; I heard of this robbery and went to the prisoner's father's house, in consequence of what I heard between twelve and one o'clock on the Saturday night; I found the house shut up - I tried the door first; it was fastened - I knocked, and the prisoner's father came to the window; there was no light in his room - I told him I wished to speak to him; he put his head out of the window; I asked him to come down - he refused; I told him I wanted Russel Brown (the prisoner); I saw the prisoner at the window, and asked him to come down stairs for I wanted to speak to him - he said he was both drunk and cold, and could not come down that night; he came down at last and unlocked the door - I heard his father say to him "You bl - y fool now they will take you to the cage and lock you up;" he had not at that time unlocked the door; when his father said that, he said; so help him God he could not unlock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his voice? A. I heard him come down stairs, and I knew him before; I told him he might do as he pleased; if he did not open the door, I must use other means to get in other ways; he at last opened the door, and I took him: he was undressed - he dressed before I brought him away; he put on a pair of breeches, this smock-frock, and a flannel jacket on the top of the smock-frock; when he put the frock on I observed some blood on it; I did not observe his hands till I got him to the watch-house - they were then all over blood; I asked him how that blood came on his smock-frook - he said he could give a very good account how the blood came there - that it was with stabbing a horse in the North-road on the Friday week before the robbery; the blood on the frock was quite wet - it had the appearance of recent blood. On Monday, the 24th of March, I took him from the watch-house to Clerkenwell New prison; I said nothing to induce him to say anything; as we went along he said, had he known that his father and mother could not have settled it with the old man on Sunday morning, that he would have hung himself in the cage; he showed mean old silk handkerchief, and said that was what he had tied round his knee for a gaster, and he could have done it with that, though I had taken two handkerchiefs from him in the cage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the cage with the prosecutor and his son on the Sunday? A. Not in the cage, but in the work house yard. I saw the prisoner and young Galletly talking together, but did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From whom did you receive the information which led you to the prisoner's house? A. From those who were in the public-house: I had not seen Lock, the watchman, before I went to the public-house - I did not tell the prisoner why I took two handkerchiefs from him in the watch-house - what he said about regretting that he had not hung himself, was quite of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced a third handkerchief, to show you that though you had taken the precaution, he could have hung himself? A. Yes; he was to go to the New prison till the Monday, on this charge; he did not tell the Magistrate he had committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the house he was about to unlock the door, but his father prevented him? A. Yes; I do not know that he knew I was a constable - I was outside, and did not tell him my business till I got in, but I asked him if his name was Brown, when he put his head out of window, and he said it was; I asked the father to come down, for I wanted to speak to him very particularly - he would not come down, but the son did: and was about to unlock the door, when his father called him a fool; he at first refused to open the door, but afterwards he did open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he dress himself in your presence? A. I was at the front door; Reeves stood with me - he was in the dark when he dressed himself, in the back room - I took the candle when he had the smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you spoke to him about the blood being wet, did he not say it was beer that had been spilt on it? A. He said the blood being wet was through beer being spilt upon it at the public-house, and said how the blood had come there; he made no attempt to escape - he could not have escaped, I am certain; the man who was with us stood between the door posts of the back room - there was a window to the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in that room by himself? A. Reeves stood between the door and the door-post, and I was close by; the back room leads out of the front - this room was on the ground floor; I suppose he had an opportunity of getting out of the back window if he liked - his father had looked out of the front room window up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where does the back window open to? A. I do not know, for I was never in the house before.</p>

            . I assisted in apprehending the prisoner; his hands were all over blood, and his smockfrock also; the blood on the frock was quite moist.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was all the frock wet, or only the bloody parts? A. All the bloody places on the frock were wet - there was no wet but what appeared to be blood.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Cox, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100023"></xptr>surgeon. I remember the prosecutor being brought to Mr. Cox's surgery about half-past eleven o'clock on the night in question; I found two lacerated wounds on the parietalia bone of the skull; they penetrated to the bone, but did not injure the bone, and there was a bruise on his temple: the wounds appeared to have been made by some heavy instrument.</p>
               <p>JOHN REYNOLDS re-examined. I found this stick next morning on the ground where the robbery was committed - it stood up the fence, and all on the ground was blood. (Producing a thick stick.)</p>
               <p>MR. HITCHCOCK. The wounds were such as might be occasioned by a stick of that description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could the two wounds have been produced by one blow of that stick? A. No - there are two wounds; there must have been more than one blow.</p>
               <p>JAMES GALLETLY. That is my stick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the public-house to have a pint of beer, and sat there two hours or two hours and a half; and about half-past ten o'clock I was going home - I had about three parts of a pipe of tobacco left; I took it out, and at the door I saw the watchman coming by - I went round the pond, and threw my pipe into the pond; as I came along I saw the watchman by Mr Bagwel's shop; I then saw my two brothers and my father - we went into the public-house, and had some beer, and then went home to bed. I am quite innocent of the crime.</p>

            . I noticed the frock he had on when he was at the public-house; I observed nothing on it - I cannot say it was the same frock as that produced.[Here the frock was handed to the Jury.]</p>

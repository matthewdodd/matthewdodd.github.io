                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Law, and live at No. 18, Ernest-street, Regent's-park, I let lodgings. On the morning of 18th Aug., the prisoner came to hire a lodging—she had no baby with her then, in the evening she came with a baby—she said she had a husband who was a carpenter, and he had a job at Kingsland and would be there on the Monday but no husband ever came—she had left me a deposit of sixpence—I was not at home when she came with the baby—I did not see the baby till after 12 o'clock, the same night—I looked at the baby, it was asleep in the room—the prisoner did not come home till a quarter to 1 o'clock—I told her of leaving the baby—she said it would not wake, it slept soundly—I did not see the baby again till the Tuesday—the prisoner was then at home with it and said she was going to take it out—I saw the child was very thin, but I saw nothing particular—I saw it again the same evening about half past 11 o'clock—I heard it crying—I went and knocked at the door to ask if the prisoner was there—I had no answer—I went in and found the child alone and crying—I looked to see if there was any milk in the room to give it, and there was none—I do not know what time the prisoner came home that night, I did not see her—I saw her about 11 o'clock the next morn<lb></lb>ing—I told her I had given the baby a little cake, and I asked her if she had fed it—she said she had not—I said, I thought I had heard it—she said I had not, it was asleep—I asked her if she would feed the baby, and she mixed some bread up and fed it with bread alone, no milk—on Thursday I left home, and I was away a fortnight all but one day—I came home on a Wednesday—my husband said something to me, and I went to look at the baby—I found it lying at the foot of the bed—that was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was not there, and there was no one to look after the child—it was like a little skeleton, it could hardly cry—it could only make a very little noise indeed—it was so very thin—I tried to feed it with a little milk—it did not take it at first, but it afterwards took a spoonful or two—after I had fed it the prisoner came in—I told her I thought she had neglected and starved the baby—I told her it looked like it—she said she had not, she had given it a halfpenny worth of milk a day—I spoke to my husband and he went to the workhouse, and Mr. Adams came and saw the child—I was not in the room when he came—the prisoner told me he had ordered medicine for it—I saw the mother give it one spoonful—I saw the child that evening, about half past 7 o'clock—the mother and Maria Hall were there—they were not nursing or feeding the child—they were both singing—I knocked twice before they opened the door—the prisoner was there then, but had got her bonnet and shawl on ready to go out—I went to the room again the same night, the prisoner was not there then—Hall was there, and was asleep—I knocked, and Hall opened the door—I asked how the baby was, and I looked at it—I do not know what time the mother came home that night—she came to me the next morning about half past 7 o'clock—I went up, and the young girl that had got the child sitting up in bed with it—it was just alive—it died while I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. I remember the prisoner and child coming to my house on Saturday, 18th Aug.—I went in the room on Tuesday evening, about 12 o'clock—there was no one there</p>

               <p>but the child—it was nice and clean, but looked very thin and delicate—it was in the head of the bed—I stayed up to see what time the mother came in—she came in a quarter before 1 o'clock, and I had seen her go out a quarter before 9 o'clock—I told her it was strange conduct to bring a child of that age into my house and leave no one to look after it—she said I need not be afraid of the child waking, it would sleep till half past 9 or 10 o'clock in the morning—I saw my wife feed the child on the Tuesday—the child seemed capable of taking food then—it took it very ravenously—my wife left home on Thursday, and was away till the Wednesday week—I visited the child several times during my wife's absence—the mother was never with it after 7 o'clock in the evening—I do not know what time she came home—I have sat up till half past 1 o'clock, till I could sit no longer—she had a key of the street door—on the Friday morning in the week after my wife left, I spoke to the prisoner—I told her I was positive a child of that tender age could not sleep so, unless she drugged it—"Drugged it!" she said, "I don't know what you mean; my baby is attended to, and looked after properly"—I said, "In my opinion, you are starving your child to death"—my wife came home on Wednesday, 5th Sept, and I spoke to her about the child—she went up to it—she called me up to see the horri<lb></lb>ble state the child was in—she sent for a cake and some milk, and the child took the food most ravenously, it could not be fed fast enough, though it was only skin and bone—I put on my coat to go to the station, and while I was doing so the prisoner came in—I said, "You wretched woman, you have murdered that poor baby" (I should say the child was about nine weeks old)—she said, "The child is not dead"—I said, "No, but it can't live, in my opinion, many more hours"—she asked me in what way I supposed she caused the child's death—I said through starvation—she said the child was diseased, it was not the want of food that caused it to be so thin—I told her if it had any complaint, it was her duty to have medical advice for it—she said she had had medical advice—I asked her where the medical gentleman lived, that I might go and ascertain what was the disease, for I was then going to the station to make complaint—she said the medical gentleman lived a long way from there, and it was no business of mine—I went to the station, but I got no assistance—I went to the workhouse, and got assistance—Mr. Adams came the next morning—I let him in—he saw the child—I did not go upstairs with him—the child died on Friday morning.</p>

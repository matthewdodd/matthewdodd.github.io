The prisoner lodged in the house - He was with me the greatest part of the evening. I lost my watch, and about seven weeks afterwards I found it hanging up in the bar of the Goose and Gridiron, St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH REID. I keep the Hampshire Hog. Wright had a club at my house-Ellen was with him. I saw Wright pull out his watch at half-past nine o'clock. They stopped in my house till twelve o'clock, and then went out and returned again; the prisoner went to bed sometime before they went away - They left about two o'clock, and in about a quarter of an hour they came back again, saying Wright had lost his watch; the prisoner was then in bed-they were intoxicated.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS ELLEN. I keep the Goose and Gridiron. On the 26th of June the prisoner called at my house, saying his master was out of town, and asked me to lend him a 1l. note on the watch - I hung it up in the bar.</p>

It appeared, the Prisoner coming into the house where the Deceased was, wanted one Gwyn to be sent for, which the House refusing he took up the Pot and threw it against the Window, which rebounded against the Deceased, who sat under it; upon which she said he had murdered her, and next day voided near 3 quarts of Blood at her mouth and nose. But the Surgeon deposed, that on opening her head he found she had an Imposthumation, which breaking, might be the occasion of her death, and that he could perceive no marks of outward Violence about her; that he verily believed it was the occasion of her death. And several of the Witnesses deposed, that when the Blood issued from her, it occasioned such a stench in the Room, that they could scarcely endure it; and it also appeared, that the Prisoner had no premeditated malice against her.

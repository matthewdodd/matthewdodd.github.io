The prisoner was servant to me for a month and four days; she conducted herself with great propriety until the 10th of August, (my wife had died a few days before she came) - she then followed me into the parlour with a knife in her right hand, and struck me two blows with her left; I followed her into the kitchen, took the knife from her, and - she ran to the kitchen fire, and seized the tongs, and brandished them over my head; I took them from her, and got an officer; she gave no reason for attacking me - we took her before the Magistrate, and charged her with the assault - the Magistrate advised me to pay her her wages and get rid of her. On the same day when her wages were paid, she brought her boxes into the passage; I requested her to open them, and she refused; I said, if she was an honest woman she need not be afraid; she did not open them - the officer took her again before Mr. Hood, the same Magistrate, and opened them in his presence, and found this property - she said they were mine, that she had put them there to preserve them, and that she intended to return them.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of August I was ordered to put the prisoner out of Mr. Dodd's house; I asked her to bring her boxes down stairs, and go as quick as she could - she was a long time - when she came down, Mr. Dodd wished to have them searched; she said she did not strike her master intentionally. She refused to open her boxes. I took her before the Magistrate; she said she could not find the key; I took her back to the house - she found the key; we returned to the office - she opened the boxes - these things were found. She said she must have put them there by mistake, in her fright.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Soon after Mr. Dodd hired me, he informed me he intended to make me his wife, we lived together as husband and wife, and I considered the property of one to be the property of the other, our clothes were intermixed, and I hope I shall not be considered criminal in putting some things in my box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper and dairy-man, carrying on business in Crown-court, Drury-lane—the prisoner was in my service as a milk-carrier—I paid him 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—it was part of his duty to receive money from my customers—it was his duty to pay me the money he received during the week every Saturday night—I do not know whether he kept a book of his receipts—he was in the habit of telling me what money he had received, and of pay<lb></lb>ing it to me—I had formerly a partner, Mr. Sockett—it is twelve months since I was in partnership—I advanced money to the prisoner on the security of a milk-walk—I have some duplicates which he wished me to advance money on—I would not do so until I was satisfied they were come by fairly—I held them for money that was intended to be advanced, if I liked the duplicates—I entered into no particular agreement with regard to them—after I had satisfied myself I was to make a bargain if I chose—the prisoner was not satisfied himself that they were all right—he said he had them given</p>

               <p>him by a relative—if I found they were honestly come by, I might or I might not have advanced the money—I recollect the 21st of Feb. last—it was Saturday according to my ledger—I entered all the sums paid by him on that day in this book, at the time he paid me—I have them here in my handwriting—there is not a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid me on the 21st of Feb. last from Mrs. Cecilia Clarissa Hayes—I did not receive that money—there is no entry of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 14th of March—the prisoner did not pay me that—there is no payment of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., entered on the 10th of Jan. from Harriet Cleale—he did not pay me that sum—I taxed him with not having paid these amounts—he said he had not received them—the sum on the 10th of Jan. is in the name of Mrs. Flower—she is the servant—there was a sum of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid by the same party, on the 4th of Jan.—he denied having received that.</p>

I believe it was, on it—I had no re<lb></lb>ceipt—there was an agreement—the prisoner has it—I have a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not think there was anybody by when I advanced the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was in my house—the amount I gave is on that paper—I have advanced the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took no receipt more than that agreement—I do not know that he has been dissatisfied about this 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ever since he has been in my service—he knew he could have possession of his walk when the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid me—I have had a subsequent arrangement with him, and gave him 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, he and his son—I was to have the services of both for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the arrangement was made in June or July last—the date is on that memorandum.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MELLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old is the son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A little boy ten or twelve years old—his services are not very valuable—the ledger entry is written at the time it bears date—the sums are entered each week, the months are entered at the top of the book—I had the duplicates a few days before giving him into custody—I had paid up all his wages when he wanted me to advance money on them—I do not remember the day—he had asked me to advance money on the duplicates on the previous day—he put them down and said, "Here are the duplicates"—I believe there were eleven or twelve—I kept them to make inquiries—I wrote to Mr. Edwards, of Bath, to know whether the tickets were genuine, because the prisoner did not know—Mr. Edwards was not at Bath, and I did not apply any more—I kept them—he had milk to sell on his own account—he paid me the wholesale price—he had customers of his own, but only at the shop—his wife used to sell milk there with my sanction—when I dissolved with Mr. Sockett I did not enter into an arrangement that I was bound by a penalty not to supply customers on the Southwark side—there was no arrangement in writing.</p>

               <p>Flower—I hold the document in my hand which shows when the walk was redeemed, it is signed by Sockett—I had some pails of the prisoner's when I gave him into custody—I should say the value of them is about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can<lb></lb>not recollect that I said anything to Mr. Sockett about the duplicates and the pails—I may have told him that I had duplicates in my possession—I cannot recollect saying they were valuable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MELLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These duplicates were put into your hands long after the alleged embezzlement had taken place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a short time ago—the prisoner was in my service when I was in partnership with Mr. Sockett—I knew the quantity of milk the prisoner took out, and the number of customers, and I received money corresponding with the quantity he took out—if he had disliked the engagement he could have got out of my employment by giving me notice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In May, 1845—the prisoner was in the service of both of us, previous to the dissolution—he pledged his milk-walk for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a mortgage of a milk-walk—if he paid the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the milk-walk went back to him—I had the use of the milk-walk—he was to serve me in it.</p>

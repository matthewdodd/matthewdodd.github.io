            . On the 8th of December the prisoner came to my house, between seven and eight at night, and enquired for a coat he had pledged with me: while I was turning to get the coat, I heard a noise on my counter: I looked behind me, and asked him what he meant by being on the counter; he sprung from it; he said he only leaned upon it: I said it had an ugly look with it. I did not challenge him then any farther; this was on a Saturday night: when the shoes were called for, mentioned in the indictment, they were missing: about a fortnight after I went to

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost the things mentioned in the indictment the 19th of June; a little after six, and I met my woman; we both went home together, and the first thing we saw on our return was the prisoner coming out of the door of our house; she lodged in the same house; the moment she saw us she turned in her head; I ran and unlocked the door, and I missed one coat, two waistcoats, one pair of breeches, one cloak, one handkerchief and one pair of stone knee-buckles set in silver, they may be worth four or five shillings; I asked my woman what became of the things.</p>

               <p>What your wife? - Yes, my lord, and I was going up stairs, and I saw the prisoner sitting on the stairs with something in her lap; I asked her what it was, she said, they are your things; I said, so I suspected; she said, it is so, and what of that; I took the things out of her lap down stairs, and put them in the room again; I made her go up stairs till I searched the things, then I missed the pair of buckles, and the handkerchief; she would not acknowledge the things, so I went for an officer, and kept her in custody; and I went to her to Newgate on Monday evening, and she told the she have the buckles into a horse pond where the horses drink; I went there and searched and found one of the buckles on Tuesday evening; I never found the handkerchief, she gave me no account of that; all the rest of my things I have got; they are here.

               <p>Prisoner. When he came to me at Newgate, he said, it I would not confess he would hang me.</p>

               <p>I lodged in this house; the door was open of the prosecutors, and the drawers, and I took the things up for safety; I saw the landlord coming home, and I put the things in my lap, and delivered them to him, and he said, if I would not confess he would hang me, and if I would but confess, he would make a slaw in the indictment; and I hope, gentleman, as I have nobody but God and myself, that you will have mercy upon me.</p>

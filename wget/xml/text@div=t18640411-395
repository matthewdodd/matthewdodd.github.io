                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Charles Bloxam, of Bedford-place, Russell-square—on Sunday-evening, 13th March, about half-past 7, I was coming out of the drawing-room with a candle in my hand, and saw the prisoner going up the stairs—directly he saw me he came back and shook hands with me, and asked how I did—I said I did not know him—he asked if I did not remember seeing him at the Casino the other night—I said no, I had never been to such a place in my life—he begged my pardon, and walked out of the house as fast as he could—I went into the dining-room and saw that the top sash was pulled down from the top to the bottom, as far as it would go—I had been in the dining-room about an hour before—the window had been open about a quarter of a yard from the top all the afternoon.</p>

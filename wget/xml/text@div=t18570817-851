                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of No. 32, Moorgate Street. The prisoner has been in my employ about nine months—I was in the habit of sending him to the Times office with advertisements—on Saturday, 18th July, I sent him with two classes of advertisements; one was to be inserted twice, and the other three times—I gave him a sovereign to pay for them—he brought me back this ticket, "Two insertions, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; three insertions, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—is is a printed form, filled up in writing—something in the figures attracted my notice; I examined it with a magnifying glass, and it appeared to have been passed over with a pen—I went to the Times office, and made inquiry—I went back to my own office—I called the prisoner, and said to him, "Where is the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that you did not pay at the Times office?"——his reply was, "I have no 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—I said, "Yes, you have got a half sovereign and a florin"—he then said, "It is the only time I ever took it"—I ordered him to turn out everything in his pockets, and he turned out some keys and some copper money—I said, "Where is the silver?"—he said, "It is under the mat outside"—I called an officer, and went with the prisoner, and on raising the mat we found a piece of paper, which contained the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell, and am a clerk in the Times newspaper office—I know the prisoner by his coming from Mr. Dirks—I remember his coming on 18th July, about half past 11 o'clock—he paid me for the insertion of two advertisements at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him this receipt; when I gave it him, the figures "2" and "8" were written on it—since then there has been added to it a "3" and "12," so that it is now the receipt for five advertisements, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a different coloured ink has been marked over the "2" and the "8" since it left me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When it left your hands, was there any mark of red ink on it, as there is now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they were put on it since—when it was brought to me I referred to our books, and marked out the "3" and the "12," and marked 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there to show that it had been paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a notice on it, that if any inquiries were to be made about it, this ticket was to be brought—I write these figures for the insertion and the money, without using the word "paid."</p>

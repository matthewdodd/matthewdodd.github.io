               <p>You yourself did not see the knife in his hand? - No, I did not, I should not have taken hold of him, only Mr. Lee the grocer, the corner of King-street, said, he had like to have cut me.</p>
               <p>Did he wound any body? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether both my hands were not in my jacket pockets at that time, and as I went along they took the knives out of my pocket? - I never saw any knife taken out of his pocket, his left hand was down; I said to the prisoner, says I, you ought to be ashamed to carry a knife open as you did, and he said, damn me, I would have cut you.</p>

               <p>My Lord, on the 3d of last December, I was landed on the island of Goree, with nineteen more, the soldiers were drawn up in a circle on the parade, the Lieutenant of the island ordered us all into the middle of it, and told us we were all free men, and that we were to do the best we could, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100067"></xptr> he had no victuals, there was a ship lay in the bay, I went on shore several times and did work for the governor, I remained there till the time I came home, which was last Saturday was three weeks, I did not chuse to go into the hands of the enemy, I got on board of this English vessel, I had engaged to go out in her again, I sent to our captain yesterday by my mother, and he is clearing out his ship, and when that was done, he sent word he would come, we laid four days in the bay before the governor would receive us, he said his troops were starving already on the island, and it was very hard that he should have a parcel of men on the island; when we came away, the island was given up to the French.</p>

               <p>What is the reason that you behaved in this outrageous manner? - I did not behave so, these people speak as false as God is true.</p>

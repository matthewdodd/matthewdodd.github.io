               <p>Q.Do you remember, on the 15th of July, the prisoner being at your house? - A. Yes, the deceased was there, and one Spicer, and Fox, and Hayward, and Mr. Fenn and Spicer's son; I was in the other room; I heard the corporal call landlord; my husband was gone to bed; I went into the room, and he asked for a pot of beer, and said, he would pay for it, though this rogue and rascal had cheated him; the corporal was then in the tap-room; he said, though this rogue and rascal had cheated him, he would treat the company with a pot and pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by this rogue and rascal? A. He meant that Mr. Aldwin had cheated him.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is Spicer's son? - A.About one or two-and-twenty I suppose; I turned out to fetch the beer, and I heard Aldwin say, can you make a rogue and rascal of me: I turned short round back again, the prisoner was gone out, and Aldwin was going out; I gave him a push, and said, for God's sake don't go out, Mr. Aldwin, pary keep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Aldwin sober? - A. He was not sober, nor he was not drunk; he was between both.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner? - A. I do not think he was drunk, he had been drinking for an hour or two with his comrades in the parlour; Hayward and Aldwin gave me a push back, and then they both went out after the prisoner; I shut the door and shut them all out, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. - Q. You, upon seeing Aldwin wanted to go out, wished to stop him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented him? - A.Hayward and Aldwin both pushed me back.</p>

               <p>Q. What were they going out for? - A. I suppose to see which could fight best.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Hayward in cool temper? - A. He was rather hot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you or not that Hayward went out as a friend and encourager of Aldwin? - A. He went out, to my thinking, to see that Aldwin was righted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any words pass between them? - A. The prisoner asked Aldwin if he would go out of doors and try.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there the appearance of any friends or acquaintance of the prisoner near? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was become of Spicer and the other people? - A. They sat still, and never got up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the soldier see him do that? - A.

Yes, he asked, I believe, three times what o'clock it was; he asked first at half past eight, next time it wanted a quarter of nine, and the next time he asked it was nine; and then he went out directly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he ask after he had said, you rascal you have cheated me? - A.Afterwards he said he must be at home before ten.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. From any thing you observed, did he appear to be desirous to get home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Hayward say any thing as they were going out? - A. No, he said he must go; after that, he said, you rascal you have cheated me, and then he would knock his head off.</p>

Soon after, Syme came into the room, and looked very angry, and seemed disturbed in his mind, but to who I knew not; he called for a pot of beer, and was asking different people to drink; he was walking about, not sitting down quietly: after this, he challenged

               <p>Q. Had Aldwin been playing before? - A. Yes, one game with Spicer; they played one rubber without words; the corporal paid for it, and then said he would play him another game for another pot: I am not sure whether it was the first or second game he told Aldwin that he cheated him, and the prisoner made answer, and said, I will not play foul, I will play a fair, honourable game: they played a second game; then Aldwin cheated him again; he threw his cards down in a great passion, and said he would play no more; that he was a rogue and a rascal: he kept his seat, and then Aldwin, being aggravated, got up, and said, if he would not go ut of doors, he would knock his head off; the soldier was standing up at that time; he went towards the door, and Aldwin followed him directly, and then Hayward went out with Aldwin: in the course of this time, the corporal asked two or three times what it was o'clock, and said, if he was not home by ten, he would be locked out of his lodgings.</p>

I made answer to them, by this dial it is a quarter past nine, that was after he had had the words; the soldier had a stick in his hand almost as big as a cane, it might be as much an an inch diameter, and his side-arms as the soldiers wear them; he went out without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for his going without his hat? - A. It was in passion, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. He took off his hat in a passion - did he not appear to have gone out and forgot it? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.After he had accused this man of cheating, he asked what o'clock it was, and yo told him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Aldwin perfectly sober? - A. He seemed to me to be sober; the soldier was not quite sober, but seemed enough of what he was doing.</p>
               <p>- HAYWARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a gardener: I was at Dunton's the 25th of July, with the prisoner and Aldwin, and other persons; I went into the White-hard, and called for a pint of beer, about nine o'clock, William Aldwin was there, and the prisoner was there; Aldwin was sitting, and the prisoner standing up with his hands behind him, and seemed to be in a passion about something, but I did not take any notice of that at all; I had my pint of beer, and sat down in the corner of the room; presently after, I heard somebody call out for the dominos to be brought, but who it was I do not know, and the landlord immediately came in, and said, either that he had none, or he would not let him have any; there was a man of the name of Spicer sat by me, and I saw the dominos pass by him; after that, the prisoner and Aldwin sat down near me and played dominos, I believe, for a pot of beer, and the prisoner caught Aldwin out in cheating him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that he did cheat him? - A. No; I took no notice at all of it, any further than the prisoner said he had cheated him; he threw the dominos down, and swore he would not play any more; then the prisoner called for a pot of beer, and said he would pay for it, and kept on quarrelling, but I did not pay attention to the words that passed; Aldwin got up, and said, if he called him so again he would give him a knock or a punch of the head, I do not know which it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Or knock his head off his shoulders? - A. It was either a knock or a punch of the head, as near as I can remember; the other still kept on quarrelling, and they challenged each other to fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that? - A. There was a challenge give between them, and they were both agreeable to go out to fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the soldier enquired as to the time of night? - A. No; I did not take any particular notice of any thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him ask what it was o'clock at any one time? - A. At no one time at all; then they went out to fight, the soldier went out first, and left his hat behind him upon the tap-room table, with a stick in his hand; Aldwin followed him, and I drank my beer, meaning to go off, but I followed them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might you be after them? - A. As soon as I had drank my beer out, it might be a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Not in less time? - A. Not in less, to my knowledge; when I went out, the prisoner was standing about ten yards from the door of Dunton's house, and Aldwin was standing near to the door, I observed them by the light of the candle through Mr. Tollit's window; I stepped before Aldwin, and said, do not you see the danger you are in, you shall not fight him; I asked the prisoner why he got so far back in the dark.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you explain to Aldwin what the danger was? - A. No, I did not tell him the danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what was the danger? - A. I saw him with a stick in one hand, and a bayonet in the other; he still got further back, till he got from the light of the candle altogether; then Aldwin gave a slip by me, and said, you rascal, put up your bayonet; at the first examination, before the Magistrate, I was in a great fright, and had not the presence of mind to remember that word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he did put up his bayonet? - A. No, I did not, he got into the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me whether you believe he put up his bayonet or not? - A. I do not know whether he did or not; but I have great reason to believe he had put it up, for I did not see it when they were struggling together; they struggled across the street, and both fell down together; I did not go nigh them to his assistance till I heard some other person's tongue with them, and then I went across the street, and William Hayward was there, and John Young was there, there were many people came up, but I did not observe who; when I came up, I saw the prisoner, and Aldwin upon him, and as soon as Aldwin was lifted up, somebody else lifted up the prisoner, I do not know who; I saw the stick in Aldwin's hand immediately after he was lifted up.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had Aldwin a stick when he went out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The soldier had one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose stick was it that Aldwin had? - A. I do not know; it appeared to me to be like the same stick, but I could not say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110037"></xptr>Q.Had the soldier any when he was lifted up? - A. I do not know, for I was not looking at him, but asking Aldwin if he was hurt; I did not mention that at any examination that I asked him if he was hurt; he said he was not hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the soldier? - A. No, I did not take any notice of the soldier; I then immediately heard the sound of a bell with a stick, but I could not say what it was it was very near to a tree; but I am not sure whether it was against the tree or the prisoner, but I rather thought it was against the prisoner; after that, I turned myself about, meaning to go home and not to follow them any farther; I saw the prisoner walk away upon the pavement, and immediately after that, before I got across the street, in the course of a minute or too, I heard an alarm given by the people, somebody said, the rascal has drawn his bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the prisoner and Aldwin were scuffing together or not? - A. No; after Aldwin had struck a blow with a stick, I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never sworn, that after the blow with a stick, you saw Aldwin and the prisoner scuffing, and then you heard that the man had drawn his bayonet? - A. I never said, or swore such a thing; I then went under the gateway to take care of myself, I found a heath broom belonging to a poor woman, and I took that; I did not mention that in my examination, as he did not hurt me, I did not think it worth while to mention it; but as I came out from the gateway he was coming across the street with a bayonet in his hand, and he met me full; but there were many people in the street running about for fear.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they saying any thing, or making any noise? - A. The prisoner run at me with his bayonet, and struck at me three or four times, and I struck at him several times with the broom, to try to knock the bayonet out of his hand; I found I could do nothing with him, I threw the broom away, and made my escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have made your escape sooner if you had chose it? - A. I could not in safety; I did not know which way to run when the alarm was given that the bayonet was drawn, and then I run up the gateway to get this broom in defence of myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you never said, that the corporal and Aldwin did fight together after they had got up, and after the blow was struck? - A. No, I never did, that was the only blow I saw struck, nor I did not see the prisoner do any damage to any person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.First of all, who were the people that called out the rascal has drawn his bayonet? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that come from Youans, Hayward, or yourself? - A. It did not come from me, nor from them, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it called out, d-him, knock his brains out? - A. That I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be assembled when the call was made that he had drawn his bayonet? - A. I cannot say; there might be as many as a dozen or more, I cannot say, nor I do not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. And the object of them all was to attack the man because he had drawn his bayonet? - A. I suppose that every man might try at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one man, in all this concourse of people there assembled, that seemed on the part, or the side of the prisoner? - A. I did not see any person against the prisoner or for him, any farther than the man he was fighting with.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a minute or two before you followed Aldwin out of the house? - A. It might, I stopped to drink my beer; if they had not gone out of the house, I should have gone home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of the house, this minute or minute and a half afterwards; Aldwin was then nearer to you than where the soldier was? - A. Yes; he was gone nine or ten yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came there, Aldwin rushed past you up to the soldier? - A. Yes, and said, you rascal, put up your bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q.After that, you saw a stick in the hand of Aldwin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you prevent Aldwin from following this man? - A. I had no business with it, it was all done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Dunton, the mistress of the house, desirous to prevent Aldwin from following the soldier? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not shove Mrs. Dunton away from her attempt to stop Aldwin? - A.Not to my knowledge; I do not remember seeing Mrs. Dunton at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now supposing Mrs. Dunton has said that you did, has she said true or false? - A. I do not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out at the same moment with Aldwin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How many people might there be at the time you laid hold of the broom stick? - A. There might be ten or a dozen people, more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Aldwin strike a blow with a stick? - A. A blow was given by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did yo see the corporal return that blow, or offer to return that blow? - A. I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I came up during the scuffle between Aldwin and the prisoner on Thursday evening the 25th of July, I was coming through Uxbridge town on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110038"></xptr>horseback, I heard some of the populace cry out, a fight, a fight.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think there might be? - A. From a dozen to twenty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What are you? - A. I keep a mill at Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night might this be? - A. I think nearly about ten o'clock; when I came near enough to see, they got out in the middle of the road; there was one in the middle, a soldier; I did not at first discover that he had a bayonet in his hand; after a short space of time I discovered it, he brandished it, and they were all round him, eight or ten people, or more; it was exceedingly dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the people employing themselves? - A. They were attacking him, they knocked him down several times, and the man was extremely ill used.</p>
               <p>Court. I have seen all the depositions, and after what this gentleman has said, there can be no doubt what this case is: it cannot be less than manslaughter, nor can it be more.</p>
               <p>WASEY HAYCOCK sworn. - I am a surgeon: I examined the deceased.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you suppose to be the occasion of his death? - A.An inflammation, which terminated in a gangrene; there was a wound about an inch below the navel; he died about twelve o'clock on Saturday morning, the blow was on the Thursday night, it was a triangular wound, and I have no doubt of that being the cause of his death.</p>

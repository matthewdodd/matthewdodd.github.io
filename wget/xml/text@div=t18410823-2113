                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in John-street, White Horse-lane, Stepney, and take in washing and mangling. I had a basket of clothes from Mrs. Davis, of Stepney, on the 22nd of July—they were mangled about four o'clock, and 1 gave them to Ann Pool, to take to Mrs. Davis—I am sure that there was a shift amongst them—Mrs. Davis sent her son, who said there was a shift missing—Ann Pool was in my pre<lb></lb>sence at the time—she looked at me, and said, "What will you do?"—I said, "I don't know, I sent them all by you"—I then sent her to another person I sent clothes to, and it was not there—about six o'clock Ann Pool wanted 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me, and she said she could get the shift if I would go with her—I went with her—she went to a pawnbroker near Limehouse church—it was not there—I afterwards saw this shift at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. On the 22nd of July, Mary Pool came and offered this shift in pledge—on looking at it I found a name had been marked on it in blue cotton, and picked out—I asked if it was hers—she said yes, and she lived at Bankside, Southwark—we then fastened the door—she tried to get out, and said she was going to get the owner—we said, we thought she said it was her own—she said it was hers—we then asked how she came so far to pawn it—she said she might have come to see a friend—she then said she bought it in Petticoat-lane, she gave half-a-crown for it and the shoes she had on.</p>

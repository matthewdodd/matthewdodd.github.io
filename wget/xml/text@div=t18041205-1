             had a roll of new lead on his shoulder, and Kelly had a bag of old lead; Caithness is a plumber, and Kelly is a labourer, to Mr. Spence; I catched them with the lead, and I asked them where they were going with it; they said they had been working on board the Ganges, for Mr. Spence, and the lead they were going to carry to their master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Mr. Spence, and where he lives? - A. He lives close to the office, in Wapping, he is a master plumber; I did not have any doubt but the lead was very right, I let them go with the lead; and after they had gone a little distance, I was a little dubious, I turned round, and saw them going towards Wapping with the lead; I sent Rodman to watch them, and I followed after, and when he was a little way from me he called to me; we saw them again at the public-house, the sign of the Rising-sun, where I took them into custody, directly opposite to Mr. Anderson's, an old iron shop; I questioned them what they had done with the lead; they told me they had left it where they knew where to find it, it was of no consequence to me what they had done with the lead; I insisted upon their telling me what they had done with it; I took them into Anderson's shop, and I asked Anderson what became of the lead those two men had left in his shop; Anderson strongly denied that they had left any lead in his shop; and by threatening to take them before the Magistrate, Caithness said to Mr. Anderson, what is the use of denying it, you took the lead from off my shoulder, and carried it backwards; Anderson and Caithness had a long contest in the shop; Anderson strongly denied it, his daughter and wife also denied it; Kelly said nothing; Caithness still insisted that he left it there; I took them all before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understood you that they said it was Mr. Spence's property? - A. Yes, they said that.</p>

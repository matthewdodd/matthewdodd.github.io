On the 27th of June, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I had been into a clothes shop in <placeName id="t18170702-78-crimeloc450">Rosemary-lane</placeName>

I came out and got about twenty yards from the door, the prisoner laid hold of my arms, pinioned me, and pushed me against the wall, while the others took my purse out of my pocket. I laid hold of him, he made off with the rest, I ran after them, and secured him, he said it was not him, but that the others had got my purse, and shewed me which way they were gone. I went after them, and left him with the crowd, but could not catch them; when I returned I found the prisoner had got away. I ran after him, secured him, and gave him in charge. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL NUTT. I live in Old Gravel-lane. On the 27th of June, I saw Byers come out of the shop, he pulled his purse out to count his money, and put it into his pocket again; the prisoner took hold of his trowsers and pushed him against the wall, when another man took the money out; there were three others with him-they ran away. Byers caught the prisoner, he said it was not him; Byers let him go, to run after the others. He caught him again. I am sure he is the man.</p>

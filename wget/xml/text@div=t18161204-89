               <p>JOHN ELVES. Being told, by the last witness, that Rankler had taken my shutters, I went the next day, and found them at an old iron-shop, which is kept by the prisoner, Dowding, about ten o'clock the next morning. I went in and said, they were my property, and the officer came in directly. I asked him how he came by them; he said he gave 1s. 6d. each for them, to a girl.</p>

I did; I saw him there, and asked him if he had seen two shutters go by his house; and he said, no; he did not tell me afterwards that he had them at home. I told him I should take out a search-warrant. I afterwards went to his house and found them, and he told me he bought them of a girl.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and went to the prisoner's, Dowding, house. I asked him what he had done with the man's shutters; he was confused, and gave me no answer. He was standing by his door, in the act of moving the shutters, having both in his hands. Elves was with me, and claimed them. I asked the prisoner, Dowding, who he bought them of, and he said, of a girl, and gave 1s. 6d. for them. I asked him if he should know her; he said, he had bought a number of things of her. I asked him to show me where she lived. He went to the house where he said her father and mother lived. I could not find her out. We took them to Lambeth Police Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner told me that he had bought them of the girl, and that he knew where she lived, and accompanied me to her father's house.</p>

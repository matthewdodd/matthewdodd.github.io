            . I am an officer of Hackney. On the 29th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw two carts coming along the road - Pipkin and the prisoner were in one of them - they were shifting some potatoes from the noses of the sacks into this bag; I and Ward followed them, and when they got to Kingsland-turnpike they began to shift some corn - a man on the road gave the signal that we were officers, and they removed the property from the cart they were then in to the prisoner's cart - Ward ran and took the prisoner's cart, and Pipkin ran away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Brown at Newington. On the 29th of August, about half-past four o'clock, when I first saw them, the prisoner and Pipkin were both in Mr. Hobbs' cart, and were both taking the potatoes out of the sacks, and putting them into this bag, which was in the tail of the cart - they tied it up ready to take away - they then took this bag, and put the corn and chaff in it, and handed it to the prisoner's cart - I ran and stopped the prisoner, and said, "What have you got here;" he said, "Nothing but my own property;" I found this chaff and corn in it - he said he had to carry it for Mr. Hobbs' carter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not see the prisoner nearer the place where thoy were stolen from than seven miles? A. I stopped them near the King's Head, public-house, at Kingsland.</p>

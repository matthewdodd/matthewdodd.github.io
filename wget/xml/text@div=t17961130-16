             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: In consequence of an information, on Friday, the 18th of November, I went with a warrant, to <placeName id="t17961130-16-crimeloc81">Dudley-court, St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. That would put upon them the appearance of the halfpence you have produced, that were piled up? - A. Yes, I found this sieve where the press was; the sieve is to riddle them when they come out of the bag; it takes the saw-dust off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not know that a sieve is used in coming? - A. I have found them in all these places; this is an edging or rounding instrument, I found that fixed in a window up stairs, I took it down; when they are first cut, they have a rough edge, and this will make them smooth; here is a stocking with some misstruck halfpence in it; there were sacks nailed up to both the windows that went into the street, where any light could appear, to keep the light out, and deaden the found, I should believe, because these presses have a found; the door that went into the yard was locked, and we could not find the key; we broke it open; if that door had been open, any body in the next yard might have seen what was going on in the cellar; the prisoner being secured, said he paid eighteen guineas a year for the house; and the little girl's hands being in the same condition as her father's, I took her to the Magistrate, he discharged her.</p>
               <p>Q. How were his hands? - A. Black and greasy, as persons are in that employ.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the stamping press, do you believe or not, that it had been recently at work? - A. I believe it had been recently at work, the oil in the screw then was fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the press particularly? - A. I left that to the persons who took it down, there were some drops of a candle upon it, I found no candle alight, there was a candle near the oven; I compared some of the halfpence I took out of the pot, with the dies, they appeared to tally; they have the same date, (looks at some of the halfpence), they are all counterfeit.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am an officer of Worship-street; I went in company with Armstrong, and the rest of the officers, Harper, Ferris and Peach; I went into the cellar; I saw the press fixed, with a pair of dies in it; I remained in the cellar, and took the press down; the dies are here; I found three other pair of dies by the side of the press.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Armstrong). Explain in what way the dies are fixed, and how the press is used? - A. A die is put in the bottom, and the sly is fixed on the top,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300030"></xptr>by which they work it, and it is fixed in the ground, that the found may go downwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The halfpence have all the same impression upon them? - A. Yes; all heads and women, there are none plain.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Wray). You found the fly? - A. Yes; every thing was complete, it was in a state to work; there was a great weight at each end of the fly.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. With those weights and the oil, it goes very easy, and gives the impression.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a little girl? - A. Yes; her hands induced me to take her to the Magistrate; there was a girl bigger than her, and some little children; the biggest girl's hands appeared clean.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there people enough in the house to work the press? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have seen that sort of press before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other use it can be put to besides coming? - Yes; a variety of uses, but then they must not have dies in them.</p>

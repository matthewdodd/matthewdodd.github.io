On the 18th of September, I left my saw in my chest that day at a quarter before seven o'clock; the prisoner is my master's son- I returned on the morning of the 19th, and my tools had been taken out of the chest, and were lying about - this saw was gone; the prisoner is married - I had other articles in my box of as much value; I should think the value of all my property was five guineas - I never worked with the prisoner; he had been discharged from his father about a week.</p>

I went to the house where the prisoner lives; the landlady keeps a broker's shop; I found the saw in the cellar which belongs to the landlady; I did not speak to the prisoner about it myself, but I was in the room when Hill told the prisoner that if he would give him up the saw, he would be glad of it, and say no more.</p>

            . I am a constable. Bennett came to me- I went to the house and saw the prisoner; I asked him to let me search his room, which I did, but found nothing- when I was gone, Bennett came to me again, and said he had found the saw in the cellar; I went again, and found the prosecutor in the prisoner's room; he asked the prisoner, "Did you ever see this saw before?" he said Yes; the prosecutor said, "Then you never saw it till last night, when you took it;" the prisoner and his wife begged he would not hurt them.</p>
               <p>PHILIP HILL. This is my saw; I meant the prisoner had not seen my saw before that night, because he had been at work in the country.</p>

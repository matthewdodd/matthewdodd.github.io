                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at 95, Stainsby Road, Limehouse—on Saturday night, 28th January, I went to the prisoner's house, in Church Row, Limehouse—I there found the deceased, the prisoner's son, John William Robert Bull—he was my brother-in-law—he was there alone—I sat down with him for two hours—the prisoner then came in—he said to his son that he did not wish to see him in his place—the deceased, on that, got up and struck his father, and knocked him out of his chair, on to the floor; that was the first blow that was struck between them—the prisoner tried to get up again on to his seat, and I put the deceased out of the room—in the first scuffle the table was upset, and the lamp thrown down and broken; it was then all in darkness—the deceased rushed in again, and struck his father again, knocking him out of the chair on to the floor—I saw him strike as he came in, and I tried to get between them, and parted them—there was no light but the fire; that was very dull—he got up, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187102270031"></xptr>
               <p>his son went towards him again—they closed, and the son turned round and staggered towards the door—I did not see the prisoner strike him—he opened the door and walked down stairs, and when he got to the bottom of the stairs he fell—I went down, hearing him fall, and saw him bleeding from the head, and insensible—I procured a light, and instantly went for the doctor—the deceased was intoxicated, and the prisoner was also under the influence of liquor—I afterwards examined the stairs, and noticed blood on every stair he had come down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner bean the character of a very humane, feeling man—he lived close to the canal, and has saved the lives of three or four persons, who have attempted suicide there—I did not see him use any scissors, or any instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 4, Commercial Terrace, Lime-house—on the night of 28th January, I was fetched to 11, Church Row—I found the deceased there; he was already dead; he was lying on the floor, with his head resting between his father's knees, deluged in a pool of blood—there was a punctured wound on the crown of his head, a wound on the left knee, that had been a punctured wound; but the instrument coming in contact with the bone, had rather jagged it—on the inner part of the right thigh there was a deep punctured wound—there were one or two minor abrasions on the face, of a superficial wound, on the bridge of the nose—I think it very possible that the sharp-pointed blade of these scissors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would make such wounds as I saw—I made a post-mortem ex<lb></lb>amination—the cause of death was exhaustion, produced by hemorrhage, the result of the punctured wound in the right thigh—it was about an inch and a half in depth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no sign of blood on the scissors—the wound on the head was a simple punctured wound, near the vertex—I did not attach any importance to that wound in itself—the prisoner appeared to be in a state of excitement and grief at what had happened—I interrogated him if he knew how it occurred, or who was the cause—he said he did not; he did not know how it happened.</p>

The prisoner came to the police-station, and gave himself up, about 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, 29th January—he said he had had a quarrel with his son last night, and unfortunately, he was dead—I detained him at the station, and went to 11, Church Row, where I found the deceased dead, lying in a pool of blood—I saw the wounds on him—I searched the room thoroughly, and also the prisoner—I found no knife—these scissors were lying on the mantel-piece—they were broken, separated as they are now—I charged the prisoner with the death of his son—he said "He was very sorry for it; he struck him with something, but he did not know what.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Acorn-court, Rolls-buildings, Chancery-lane, and am a carpenter and builder. On 25th Aug., between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I met a man named Wright in Acorn-court, and accused him of decoying my daughter away—I said hold of him, and threatened to take him before the police—I said I wished to know where my daughter was—we, got to words, and from that to blows; and in the contest I felt some one stab me in the head, just over the ear, with some sharp instrument—I turned round, and saw the prisoner—I then received another puncture in the eye—I cannot say whether the prisoner struck the second blow—I bled a great deal, and went to Mr. Jones, the surgeon—I spoke about two girls, but the other had nothing to do with me.</p>

About balf-past 9 o'clock, on this night, I was coming up Acorn-court, and saw two men, of whom the prisoner is one—Mr. Rawson caught hold of the other, the biggest, and asked him where the two girls were—the man turned round and struck Mr. Rawson, who struck him again, and knocked him down—he got up again, and there was a great struggle—the prisoner went up the court, to Mr. Noonan, who I saw give him something bright, which looked like a pen<lb></lb>knife—I then saw the prioner go down the court and strike Rawson on the back of his head, and I saw the blood pour directly—I saw nothing further—I went into Mrs. Rawson's, and told her her husband was stabbed—I did not know Noonan before—I asked who he was, and Mr. Rawson said his name was Noonan—alfter the prisoner struck Rawson, J saw him pull his hand away, and Mr. Greenslade <hi rend="italic">pinned</hi> him against the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 27, Fetter-lane. On 25th Aug., about half-past nine o'clock, I examined the prosecutor, and found a small punctured wound on the left side of the head, above the ear, going to the bone—an artery was divided, and there was a very large quantity of blood—there was also a small wound under the eye, and under that the appearance of a scratch, which was not bleeding—the wounds soon healed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is a wound more or less dangerous when an artery is divided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the size of the artery; there is always danger from the hemorrhage, unless a surgeon is at hand to stop it.</p>

               <p>"Don't tell those lies; do you mean to say you have had nothing to eat to<lb></lb>day?"—he said, "Mr. Rawson bought me a biscuit"—I have heard him tell several lies, and he beats his mother—only last week I ran up-stairs when he was beating her, and ray father has constantly to go and chastise him for beating her—about a month ago he took his mother's purse—I saw her pursuing him down Chancery-lane, and he had the purse in his shoe and there are other trivial things against him—I did not know Slater till I went to Bow-street—I do not know Noonan at all; I never saw him before—I went before the Magistrate out of curiosity.</p>

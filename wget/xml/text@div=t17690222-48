            . Betwixt six and seven in the evening, on the 17th of January, I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's house with something under his arm. I followed him up the court. He went to two other boys; they turned to the left, and he went on and turned into Bloomsbury Square. I there took hold of him, and asked him what business he had in that house in the court. He said he did not know any house in the court. He had this gown under his arm. I took that and him back into the prosecutor's shop; it was wrapped in this handkerchief. (Produced in court.)</p>

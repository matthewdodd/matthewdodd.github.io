             sworn. - On the 14th of this instant, a quantity of goods came from Eades, Larkin and company, directed to my master, for shipping, at the Custom-house quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the tackle-house porter that had the care of them? - A.Jeremiah Walton, the former witness. We could not conveniently ship these goods; in the afternoon, I was in the accompting-house, I heard an alarm, that two casks were stolen off the quay; I immediately left my papers on the desk, and pursued the two prisoners, I found the casks upon their shoulders, under the Custom-house quay gateway, there they were exchanging the casks from each other's sholders; I immediately seized hold of them both by the collar; Partington then desired the other to let the cask fall; I brought him down to Mr. Walton's accompting-house, and a man followed with a cask; it is in Court; I delivered it to the officer while I was in the accompting-house; they said, they should be very glad if we would let them go, and carry the casks back to where they came from; they seemed both disguised in liquor.</p>

"; it is not my writing—this "726" is my writing—on my ascertaining the amount, I paid him, some time after he brought the bill—he brings round the bills to the persons in the market, and leaves them—he goes from one to another, collecting his toll—he may borrow a sieve to put the toll in; it is frequently in copper.</p>

                  </hi>. This is the account in the prisoner's book, in which he books the number of baskets—on 2nd June there is no entry in the book, but in the bill there is an entry of twenty packages; that is made by the prisoner himself—on 3rd June there are twenty in the bill and twenty in the book, but there is also an entry of five in the bill which are not in the book—on 4th June here are twenty-five in the book, and in the bill fifty—on 5th June there are forty in the book, and in the bill seventy-seven—the total number of baskets which appear in the book as brought in the month of June is 271, and in the bills they are 726—the amounts in the ledger and in the banker's book precisely correspond with this book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This book, you say, is not the prisoner's writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whose writing it is; I believe it is his son's writing—the bill is the prisoner's writing—the names of Hill and Day are here; I believe they are porters—I presume they are the porters who brought the goods—these casual rents, I suppose, are carts, and they are carried to another book—I do not know whether there was a distinction between packages and half packages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a trustee, and on the local committee of the Borough Market. I recollect the prisoner giving these books to me on the week ending 24th June—here are my initials every week—this day book is in the same state in which the prisoner gave it to me—the amounts of what the prisoner said Mr. Monk owed was, in the first week in June, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230114"></xptr>

"; on the 13th, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 6th, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have examined the bank book, and find these amounts were paid in.</p>

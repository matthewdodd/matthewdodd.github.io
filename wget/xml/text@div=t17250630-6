             thus deposed: I am the Watchman; and as I was coming by the Prisoner's Door between 11 and 12 at Night, I heard a sort of Jumbling: I answer'd first with my Staff, and then by word of Mouth; and so the Prisoner came to the Door, and desired me to see for her Husband at the Cock Alehouse; tho' I must needs say, that I never suspected that he was her Husband, for they lived an abominable Life together, and so I did not go to see for him; but a little while after, when my Hour was fulfill'd, I was going by the Door again, and there I saw the Deccased standing with the Door a-jar, and he desired me to light his Candle; and while I was about it, the Prisoner came down Stars with no kind of thing upon her, but her Cap and her Smock; for I just had a Glimpse of her, and she threw the Door against the Deceased, and the force of it beat him into the Street; and so the Deceased went in and shut the Door, and afterwards there was a great Lumbering in the House, and I heard the Deceased cry, Lord! Lord! Lord! Whereupon, I thought they were got to their old Trade of Quarrelling, and so I pass'd on to my Stand; and a little while after, I heard somebody call Watch! Watch! And upon that, I ran out and heard that the poor Man was departed; but not being willing to go upon my own Head, I went and inform'd the Constable about it, and desired his Instruction for keeping the Peace, and to Mr. Constable and I went to the Deceased's House, and there was he a-lying upon the Floor, and he was stab'd into the Body thro' the Coat, Wastecoat, and Shirt, and the Blood lay guthing out upon the Floor under him; but I don't remember much Discourse about it.</p>

             thus deposed: As I came thro' Dover Court, the Prisoner stood at her Door with a Candle in her Hand, and call'd the Watch: But as soon as she saw me she said, Pray, Mr. Cooper, come in and help my Husband up. I stept into the Shop, and saw the Deceased lying upon the Floor, with nothing upon his Back but his Shirt. See<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172506300002"></xptr> there, says she, how he lies dead drunk. I went to lift him up, and found there was no Life in him. I don't know whether he's drunk or no, says I, but I am sure he's dead. Lord! What shall I do? says she, I threw something at him, and I am afraid I have given him an unhappy Blow. - For God's Sake call a Surgeon. 'Tis too late now, says I, you had better call the Watch, or any of your Neighbours. And so I went and fetch'd in some of the People thereabouts; and then, upon removing the Deceased, we perceived a great Wound in his Left Side.</p>

             thus deposed. I am Constable: It was just past One o'Clock in the Morning, when my Watchman told me there was a Man dead at the Pastry-Cook's. I went and found the Prisoner sitting in a Chair in a melancholy Posture; the Deceased sitting on the Floor at her Feet, with his Head leaning in her Lap. I quickly perveiv'd he was stab'd, and told her as much, but she said the knew nothing of it. About three or four Yards from him, I found his Coat, Wastecoat, Hat and Wig, and this sharp pointed Case-Knife: It was greasy, and I thought it look'd a little tarnish'd with Blood; but when I rub'd the Tarnish with my Finger, it would not come off. This is the Coat and Wastecoat, and here's the Shirt. - You may perceive that they're all bloody, and in the Left Side of each of 'em you may see the Holes where the Knife went thro'. - Before this Accident, I have several times been call'd off my Watch upon the Prisoner's crying out Murder, when she and the Deceased have been a quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Swarton (another Watchman) thus deposed: I was upon Duty at my Stand, (near the Deceased's House) having just been beating Eleven o'Clock; and not long after, comes the Deceased and knocks at his own Door, and there he stood knocking for the Space of a considerable time; but no-body open'd the Door. Mythinks, Master Bostock, says I, they can't, choose but hear you. Hear me! Yes, L - her, she hears me well enough, says he, but I'll give it her by and by: And so at last a Gentlewoman that lodges in the House came down and let him in; and so he went up and beat the Prisoner severely, as I suppose, for I heard her cry out Murder! And then down he comes again. Doctor, says he, (for so he always call'd me) I have given it her, to her Heart's Content. The more Shame for you then, says I, to beat your Wife at such a rate. My Wife! says he, D - her, a Bitch, she's none of my Wife, and I'll turn her a-drift to-morrow. So I left him for that time, and I was call'd again afterwards, and found him lying in the Shop, and the Prisoner said, I am afraid my dear Creature is dead. - Dead! Ay, says I, be's murder'd. Then he did it himself, says she. And this is all that I know of the Matter.</p>

             thus deposed: As I was a-bed with my Wife, I heard a great Jumbling below; but it being usual betwixt the Deceased and the Prisoner, we did not mind it, and it was quickly over. Being afterwards call'd up, I found the Deceased was stab'd, and the Prisoner said he did it himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scot the Surgeon thus deposed: I open'd the Breast and lower Belly of the Deceased. He received the Wound betwixt the 7th and 8th Ribs, counting from above downwards; it pass'd thro' the Midriff and the Left Lobe of the Lungs to the Left Ventricle of the Heart, in which it terminated, and was the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. I had been at work late, and went to Bed very much tir'd, and presently fell into a sound Sleep. The Deceased came up, and beat me in a violent and barbarous manner, pull'd me out of Bed, tore all my Linnen off, and then went down Stairs. He had served me so several times before, and I always used to humour him, by going down after him, and giving him good Words to coax him to Bed again; tho' indeed I was never married to him. Now I suppose that I not coming to fetch him up so soon as he expected, he was very much vex'd at it, and so stab'd himself, tho' not (I believe) with a Design to take away his own Life, but only to territy me, by making me think that he had done himself a greater Mischief than he really had: But I suppose, when he found himself wounded deeper than he intended, he pull'd off his Coat, and went towards the Cock to wash himself; but being too weak, he might fall down. I staid above a pretty while, to see if he would come up again of his own Accord; but he not coming, I went down as naked as ever I was born, to see what was the matter; and seeing him lie all along, I thought he was either in Fitts, or feign'd himself to be so. - Speak to me, Dickey, (says I) My dear Dickey speak to me, and don't lie so to frighten me: But he made no Answer. - As to what Mr. Cooper swore about my saying I had given the Deceased an unhappy Blow, he mistook my Words; for I said, that the Deceased had given me many an unhappy Blow. <rs id="t17250630-6-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner at Greenwich Hospital. On the 3rd of June, between eight and nine in the evening, I was at the White Hart public-house, at Shadwell—I was not sober, and do not know what I was about—I know I had two crowns and small silver in my coat-pocket—the officer spoke to me—I put my hand into my pocket and found it was cut and my money was gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 212.) On Saturday the 3rd of June, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner Vines in Ratcliffe-high<lb></lb>way, and the witness Haley following him—he gave him in charge for rob<lb></lb>bing an old pensioner—in going to the station-house I asked Vines what money he had—he said, "About half-a-crown"—he was searched, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some halfpence found on him—coming out of the station-house I saw Myers and took him—he said he knew nothing about the money; he had only 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket—he was searched, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found—I saw the old pensioner afterwards in Twine-court, opposite the White Hart, quite intoxi<lb></lb>cated, and crying—he pointed across to the White Hart—I examined his coat at the station-house and found it cut, and no money in the pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the White Hart public-house at Shadwell, on Saturday the 3rd of June, about eight o'clock—I saw White sitting down there, and both the prisoners—Vines was sitting alongside the prosecutor—he was rather <hi rend="italic">groggy</hi>—Myers was standing facing him—I saw Vines put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take some shillings and halfpence out—he went out—Myers and another man followed him—while I was taking a drink of beer, the prosecutor said, "I am robbed"—he accused another man of it—I told him I knew the men that did it—I ran after Vines—I could not see him just then—I went to the Duke of York afterwards, and he was having some beer there—I caught hold of him—he said, "What do you want of me?"—I said, "You are wanted at the White Hart"—he said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Saturday, the 17th of April, I was near the Eagle tavern, City-road, and saw the prisoner in company with another—I watched him for a quarter of mile, and saw a gentleman coming along wiping his nose with a handkerchief—the moment he put it into his pocket, the prisoner and his companion turned round—the compan<lb></lb>ion took the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner, who put it into his bosom—I secured him with it—the gentleman would not prosecute—the prisoner begged hard to he let go, but I refused—I don't know the gentleman's name—he gave it, but I forget it—the other boy was less than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners's Defence</hi>. I was not with any body—the man turned round and chucked the handkerchief at me—it was not in my bosom.</p>
               <p>(Richard Wood, labourer, Elizabeth-court, Whitecross-street; and—Stevens, Glass-house yard, Goswell-street, gave the prisoner a good character)</p>

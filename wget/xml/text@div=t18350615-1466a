                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Dillon, and live in Husband-street, in the parish of St. Ann's, Soho—he is only a weekly tenant, and has the shop and parlour—other people occupy the rest—the landlord lives two doors off—we have a separate entrance—the shop door is our street door—the prisoner Jones was my servant, and had lived some months with me—on the 30th of March she and I and my two children were sitting at tea together—she said, "Ma'am, you are wanted"—I went into the shop, telling her to finish her tea—I went into the shop and sold a fender for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then she passed me, stooping with her hands and saying, "Oh my, oh my!"—I let her pass me, supposing she was going to the water-closet; and presently my little child screamed out, and made a complaint to me—I went into the parlour and missed my watch—I had seen it there when I left the room, and there was nobody else in the room but a child four years old—Jones absconded—I went to the water-closet, but she was not there—I ran into Pulteney-court, but could not see her—I did not see her again for two months—I lost a silver watch, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a gold key.</p>

I buy second-hand things, but I always buy them in Petticoat-lane, and repair them myself—the prisoner had been a lodger of mine before I took her into our service—a tinker had left her there, who lived with her in my house before—my house is not a <hi rend="italic">fence</hi> for stolen goods—I don't sell horse-rugs—I do not buy things <hi rend="italic">on the cross</hi>—</p>

If I had chalk, I would chalk it on the walls of Whitechapel"—he was very tipsy—the people in the place said, "Are not you afraid to come here and say that?"—he said, "I know well Dillon can't hurt me"—I am a coachsmith—I have been out of a situation for four months I sell my things to maintain me—I worked for Mrs. Dillon when she kept a lodging-house in St. Giles's—people lodged there for the night—I kept the house</p>

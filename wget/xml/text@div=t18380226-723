               <p>the father first, and the son afterwards—when the father came he gave the warrant up to one of my young men to hold till he sent in a man—shortly after, his son came, and it was given into his hands, and the workmen went to dinner—I said to the younger prisoner, I should have been very happy if he had come sooner, as I was in expectation of the sheriff's officers com<lb></lb>ing—he said, "Indeed, I am very much in the habit of being where they are"—I asked what they would do when they first came—he said they would search my person, and take whatever I had, even my wedding-ring, and I had better secure what I had—I went up stairs, and took from a little jar five sovereigns, ten half-sovereigns, half a franc, and some duplicates. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to have this property up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had deprived myself at times of the common comforts of life, and in my confinement actually went without common necessaries—having an infant family, five under nine years of age, I was always under the necessity of being very careful—my husband allowed me a stipulated sum for the house, and whatever I saved, by going to market from one end of town to the other, I considered was my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did yon pawn your husband's clothes, having 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not know I had the money—when I came down stairs with the money in my pocket, I took from the counter a knife, proceeded down into the cellar, and dug a hole between two posts, and buried the money in the cellar—I remained there six or seven minutes, and on rising from the ground I heard footsteps over my head, and on coming up I saw the younger pri<lb></lb>soner come to the end of the counter, handling some money—I said, "Don't interfere with that, or you will injure the work"—I went up stairs—between six and seven o'clock his father brought his great coat—they retired to the back shop, and had some conversation—I disturbed them on going in, and asked them to come up stairs to see my husband—they remained about the room till nearly eight o'clock—the father wished the son to go home—I wished him to stay, and said I would find him accom<lb></lb>modation—he would go, and left the warrant in the hands of one of my men—at twelve o'clock I went up stairs, and said to a workman, "Henry, you had better not work longer, it is late"—he came down stairs before me—I let him out, and locked the door after him—I went down into the cellar, and disturbed the mould again, and took 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the purse which was buried, for the next day's expenses—it was all right then—I buried it as before, and went up stairs to bed—between six and seven o'clock, Henry Florio, our journeyman, came, and I gave him the inventory and warrant—he continued there till twenty minutes after eight o'clock, when a knock came to the door, and I went down with him—I let in an<lb></lb>other journeyman, and went up stairs again, and Henry Florio before me—shortly after, I heard another knock at the door, I came down and saw the younger prisoner in the shop, and saw the elder prisoner come up from the step ladder of the cellar into the shop, buttoning his coat, and seeming very much confused and agitated—I said I felt greatly alarmed in conse<lb></lb>quence of his taking his son away last night, and I had kept the workman till twelve o'clock—he said then to him, "On no account do you leave this place to-day"—I said any thing he wanted I would bring him—he said, "What victuals he wants you must find him, or give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day"—I said I consi<lb></lb>dered it quite extortion—he went through the shop, returned, and said he had dropped his glove in the cellar—he went down, went out, returned in a few minutes, and went down into the cellar—his son went down after him—I</p>

               <p>went, and could see the elder prisoner standing over the hole with his arm down where the money was—the younger prisoner was by the side of him, crumpling writing paper in his hand—I stood back at our counter—the father went through the shop and said nothing—the son came up and seemed confused, and said what a d—d old fool his father was—he had lost half a sovereign in the cellar, and he had been helping him to look for it—at that moment I had no suspicion—I thought the paper in his band was the inventory, and he might be looking the goods over—shortly after, my husband came into the shop, and said he wanted some money, and must have some—I said I would give him a few shillings—I found the money was gone.</p>

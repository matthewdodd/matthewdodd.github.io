            . About half an Hour past nine, the Prisoner Waters came to my Door, and call'd for a Pot of Beer; I keep the Six Canns in Holbourn. My Maid was not so quick in drawing it as she should have been, and so I went myself, and I heard a Woman say, D - you don't stay for the Beer, but come along. He immediately went away from me towards the Cloaths Shop by Little Turnstile without drinking the Beer, and presently afterwards the Prosecutrix came up and said, she had been robb'd of her Cloak.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Waters. The Prisoner Waters keeps a Lodging House in Goldsmith's-Alley, and his Wife having lent a Gown to one who had lodg'd with him, he and his Wife, and I, and the two Prisoners went to see for it. It will be a Fortnight next Monday; I really can't tell what Time of Night it was, but I believe it was between eight and nine o'Clock. They got pretty much in Liquor at the Woman's House in Black Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane, and as we were coming by Mr. Ward's Door, Waters said he would have a Pot of Beer; his Wife thought he had had enough, and was for getting him along. The Prosecutrix happen'd then to come by, and looked at us. I asked her what she look'd at? and she said something, I can't tell what it was, and I struck her on the Side of the Face: then Ann Lee came up to her, and gave her another Knock and tore her Cloak off, and then we ran away after Waters and his Wife, who were gone a good Way before. The next Day I went to Water's House to see how he did, and was taken up for this Fact.</p>
               <p>Lee. What Gown had I on?</p>

             . On the Tuesday Morning after this Affair happen'd , I and my Headborough had a Warrant, and went to Waters's House We found the two Women Prisoners, the Evidence, and Waters's Wife drinking Tea together. Lee was not in the Warrant , and so we only took Waters, his Wife and the Evidence before the Justice, but it appearing upon the Examination that Lee was concern'd, I went to the House for her. There was a Fellow in an Apron with her, and I was pleased to swear a little, and so got her away. She seemed to make Words that she should be taken before the Justice, and Hunt left behind, so we took her too. When they came before the Justice, Hunt said, that

            . I took up Waters and his Wife, and carried them before Mr. De Veil, who committed them to New Prison for further Examination. The Evidence happened to go by my Door in the Afternoon, and I took her to the Round-house, 'till next Morning. We afterwards went to Waters's, and took the two Women Prisoners. Hunt desired to be made an Evidence, and it was agreed, that she should be one; so she told where the Cloak was pawn'd for 3 s. and it was found; but it afterwards appearing that she was deeply concerned in this Affair, the other Wom an was admitted an Evidence.</p>

            . The two Women Prisoners pawn'd this Cloak with me for three Shillings. I asked them who owned it, and Lee said it was hers. The next Day the Headborough came with Hunt to my Shop to take out the Cloak; I knew the Woman again, and delivered it to them directly.</p>
               <p>Hunt. You can't say I brought the Cloak!</p>

The next Morning I went to Breakfast at this Gentleman Mr. Waters's House, and while I was there, the Constable came and took the Gentleman and his Wife away. As to this Cloak, the Evidence over-persuaded me to pawn it, and Hunt went with me.</p>

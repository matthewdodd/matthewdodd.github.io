On Friday, 2nd May, I went to the Grapes, in Houndsditch—the prisoner came in there about eight o'clock, and be received a paper parcel, which was tied up in a piece of calico, and a brown paper inside—he left, and I and the officer Finnis followed him and stopped him at the corner of Jewry-street—I said we were two officers, and wished to know what he had—he said, "It is all right; I will take you to Mr. Petrie's housekeeper, in Mincing-lane, where I left it last night, and fetched it at nine this morning"—I asked him where he had left it all day—he made no answer—we went to the housekeeper's, and the parcel was opened in the prisoner's presence—be said, "It is all right: I brought it to rectify your other sample"—a clerk of Mr. Petrie was present—this is the parcel—it contains twelve samples, which have no marks on them—as I was taking the prisoner to the station he ran away—I followed, and took him—I found some lists of samples in his pockets—he then said he had brought it from the West Docks at four that afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper at the West India Docks—the prisoner was a sampler at No. 11 warehouse—there is indigo there, and other articles—it was his duty to stab the bags, to ascertain their condition, and to draw samples, about half-a-pound weight, and place the samples in a blue paper similar to this, with the name of the ship, and the dock number of the seron—the prisoner had been in the docks fourteen years—he was in the habit of taking out samples of indigo and cochineal to the brokers. On 2nd May he was engaged in sampling indigo of the same description at this produced for Petrie, and Pasteur, and Lewis, and Peek—there were fifty-three serons belonging to Petrie, and forty-two to Lewis and Peek—they were the selling brokers, not the consignees—on the day afterwards I went to Petrie's and saw a number of samples which had been drawn by the prisoner—they had marks on the outside wrapper of the dock number of the seron—I then went to Lewis, and found forty-two samples of indigo, bearing the marks of those that had been sampled on their account—they commenced it No. 670 and ended at No. 711—here is the entry-book which was kept by Burd.</p>

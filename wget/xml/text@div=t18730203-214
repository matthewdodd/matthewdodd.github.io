                  </hi>. I live with my husband, John Doyle, at 30, Mint Street, Southwark—the deceased, John Mahoney, lodged with me, and Rebecca Powsey lived with him as his wife—on Saturday night; 30th November, about 12 o'clock, therd was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the Union public-house, about 100 yards from our house—Mahoney was there—about 12. 10, he came in, went into the kitchen, looked round, and went out again, and stood on the step of the door with his hands in his trousers pockets—while He was standing there, Rebecca Powsfcy came up to him, and after that the prisoner came up, and said "Now, <hi rend="italic">Figgy</hi>, I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> you," and he struck him on the head, and knocked him" down in the passage, with a poker—Powsey came between them, and fell on the top of him, and her arm got fractured with one blow—the prisoner struck Mahoney three blows on the head with the poker, when he was on the ground, and Mahoney said "<hi rend="italic">Bos;</hi> don't kill me, quite"—the prisoner then got up, and ran away—there was blood in the passage; I swept it out with a broom—a crowd collected, and Mahoney was taken into the' kitchen—he was not insensible, to my knowledge—he did not send for a doctor—about a fortnight after, he was getting better, and he had a fight with one bf the lodgers, William Hall—I saw his head bleeding, and he went to the hospital the next day, and had it dressed—he did not complain to me at all the fortnight before this fight with Hall—he was getting better of the bruise—he and Hall did not fight long—the prisoner and deceased were good friends when they were Sober, but when they were a little the worse for drink they were always quarrelling—I don't know what about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I lived with Mahoney for about two years as his wife—at the time this Was done, I lodged with Mrs. Doyle—on 30th November I went to the Union public-house—there was a raffle going on—Mahoney was up stairs in the raffle room—I was in the bar—the prisoner ran in and kicked me and hit me—I did not know what he did it for, and he ran away then—I got behind a woman named Johanna Harris, to save me—the prisoner seemed to be the worse for drink, I think, or else he was mad—I had a pint of beer in one of these long-necked stone bottles, and was coming up home from the public-house to Mrs. Doyle's house, and the prisoner, as I came tothe door, lifted a poker and hit Mahoney on the head, and the fell—I did not see Mahoney till I got nearly to the door—I then saw he was standing at the door—his hands seemed to be down at his side, just as if he had them in his pockets—the prisoner hit him on the head with the poker—he said something, but I could not swear what it was—I soreamed, and ran between them; at least, threw myself more on Mahoney—I said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Bos</hi>, don't; don't kill him," and with that the poker came down again, and fractured my arm—he struck him when he was down, and mode blows at him with the poker while he was down—I ran in the kitchen to get somebody to carry Mahoney in, and before I came out the prisoner was gone—I staunched the blood—he was always complaining of his head afterwards—I believe he had a fight with Hall a fortnight afterwards—when I came in they were jangling—I did not see any blows given either way—he went to the hospital on the 1st January—he had been two or three times, and the nurse at Guy's Hospital used to dress his head—that was before he-had the fight with Hall—I know he went, because he came back with his head down up—we left Mrs. Doyle's house, and went to live opposite, a week or so after the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw the deceased in Newington workhouse afterwards—I was up with him three days and three nights; but his mother took him home, and he went to Lambeth—I did not see him dead—I did not notice the poker he was struck with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say before the Magistrate that the prisoner was so drunk that he did not know what he was about—I said he was in drink, and he could not know what he was about—he was more like a mad<lb></lb>man than anything else—he was at Newington workhouse eight days, I think, and his mother took him out and took him home for a few days, and then he went to the Lambeth infirmary—the prisoner told me he did not know where he got the poker from—Mahoney had been having drink, but was not drunk.</p>

               <p>workhouse—on 1st January, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the deceased, John Mahoney, was brought in—he was suffering from paralysis of the left side—there was a scar on the top of his head, in the middle line, of a recently-healed wound—it had been done from a month or three weeks to six weeks—he died about 11. 55 on the night of the 7th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—I treated him for paralysis—he made a statement to me—he said he was suffering from an injury received—at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I found there was on the scalp a wound just by the centre of the middle line, and at a corresponding point inside the skull, the membranes of the brain were attached to bone, just at that spot; beneath that was a patch of organised lymph, and beneath that again, in the right hemisphere of the brain, was a large abscess, containing about four ounces of matter—the other organs were, generally speaking, healthy—the cause of death was the abscess inside the brain—I think that a blow on the head with a poker would be likely to have caused the appearances I found in the head—the abscess would take some time to form and develope itself—I should have expected to find the abscess in that state if the wound had been given on 30th November—it agrees with the testimony that I have heard to-day—I think such a blow, given on 30th November, would be likely to have caused it—I don't think it could have been caused by a blow from a fist.</p>

On Sunday, again, the same three seized me and were knocking me about, and a policeman told them if they did not go off he would lock them up."</p>

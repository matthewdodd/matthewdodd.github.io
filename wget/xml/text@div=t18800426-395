I live at 28, Old Town, Clapham, and am the parish clerk—I held that office in June, 1876—I produce the register of marriages, wherein I find an entry of the marriage of Leonard George Crowle and Eliza Emily Hardcastle, 20th June, 1876, by licence—I have reason to believe the prisoner is the same man—I have net seen him since I—at all events, a man calling himself Leonard George Crowle, answering the description in the register, presented himself that day, and gave me this licence—it was my duty to take particulars from the parties for entry in the register, and to make the entries—I asked him if the particulars contained in the licence were true, and he gave me to understand they were true—the licence would state their condition—the prisoner is entered in the register as a bachelor—I should ask him twice whether what appeared in the licence was correct—I should ask him when be gave me notice of the marriage, and when the entry was made—if I had known any statement to be untrue I should have told the officiating minister, and he would not have married them, and the curate is very careful—I saw the parties sign the register—I cannot say whether they were together.</p>

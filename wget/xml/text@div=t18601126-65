                  </hi>. My husband is the landlord of the Prince of Wales public-house, Deptford—on Saturday-night, 10th November, the prisoner and another man came into our public about half-past 11 o'clock at night—one of them called for a pint of porter—he was served with it—that was, I think, the other man—I was paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by the one who ordered it—about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, the prisoner called for a quartern of rum—that was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him—he put a sovereign on the counter—I asked him if he had not smaller change—he said, "No," he wanted it changed—I took it up, and saw it was a light one—I took it in to my husband, who was in the bar parlour—he came out and interrogated the prisoner.</p>

I remember my wife coming to me in the bar parlour, on Saturday-night the 10th, and showing me a counterfeit sovereign—I went to the bar and saw the prisoner and another man there—my wife pointed the prisoner out as the person from whom she got the sovereign—I took the sovereign like this, and said, "This appears to me like a rum un, a bad one; where did you get it from?"—he said, "I met a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine in the Kent-road, as I was coming down; I told him I was hard up; he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me this"—I asked him the man's name—he did not know his name, or where he lived—I sent for a policeman, and gave both men into custody—the other was afterwards released—I gave Finch this coin—I had seen the prisoner at my public-house two or three times, and on the Thursday before.</p>

I said, "I am going to Deptford, how do you know me?" he said, "I know you well, I know your brother;" he asked me how I was getting on, and whether I would have anything to drink; I said I would rather not. I told him I had been out of work a fortnight; I said, "I am</p>

I wished him good night; he said, "Oh! you might as weil call on me;" he mentioned the name of the place where he lived; I forget it. I went to his house afterwards; he was not at home; I had some tea there, and then he came in; he took me to a public house, called for some ale, and gave a sixpence for it; I said I was rather tired; I called for some rum, and gave the sovereign; the landlady took it away into the bar parlour; they both came out togethar, and said it was a bad one. That is the truth.</p>

               <p>JOHN TRUSS. I have been in a gentleman's service - I lived with Mr. Lightenhouse thirty-two years - he is now dead. On Friday, the 1st of February, I was out of place - I went to Mile-end, and in returning, in Whitechapel-road, almost opposite the <placeName id="t18280221-27-crimeloc139">London Hospital</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been out of place? A. About a month; Mr. Lighten-house lived in Essex: I was lodging in Kepple-mews Bedford-square - I came to see a friend there till I could get a place; I went to Whitechapel to see a man who had come from the same place as me, with a friend, who left me, and I came down the road: I got there about one o'clock - I went from Kepple-mews; I went round by Mourfields - a person showed me the way there: I met the prisoner as I returned - it had not struck seven o'clock, I am sure; it was before seven; it might be a quarter before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after seven? A. It was not - it was dark; the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending the day? A. I had been walking about with this man, as his business lay, to get his load for his waggon, he being a waggoner - I went about with him: I dined with him at the Red Lion public-house, Whitechapel, but went to no other public-house - we might have three pots of beer between us and some other men - I drank very little, and was quite sober. I was so hurt by the fall, I could not get up immediately - I cut my nose and my face; when I got up the prisoner was standing there; he did not run away immediately - he wanted me to fight him for 5s. when I got up, and he would have pulled my clothes off if it had not been for the boys who came up to assist me; I said I did not want to fight, for it was a thing I never did - I wanted to know the way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of the prisoner? A. No, I had not strength to do it; the boys came and took hold of me, and he struck one of them in the face very hard, because he came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. All three of you did not manage to keep him? A. We had not strength to hold him; the boys hallooed Stop thief! the watchman was not on his beat - it was too early: I did not pursue the prisoner - he was off in an instant; he had neither shoes nor stockings on, and appeared like a begger; his trousers were torn; I cannot exactly say the colour of them: he had a blue jacket and a cap on - I swear to him by his face; the lamps were lighted. The boys led me into Whitechapel, up the road - a woman came and told the boys to take care of me, because that man would rob me very likely; she went away, and who she was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The man was a perfect stranger to you? A. Entirely. Nothing was said about fighting before I was knocked down; I understand he offered to fight me before I came to my senses, and I heard him say it after I had rather revived: a woman told the boys to take care of me, for very likely he would rob me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street, and have been there fifteen months; I have been an officer above five years. I have known the prisoner about Whitechapel between two and three years - he is an Italian, and goes about begging; he can speak English, and understands it as well as I do; I have heard him converse in English - he talks broken English, nut understands it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you apprehend him? A. I did not apprehend him; Partridge, who is not here, took him; I was at the office when he was brought there: I cannot say what money was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, Sir, as you know the prisoner, I ask, did you ever hear of his being charged with any theft? A. I certainly have - as you ask me I must answer.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Evans, of Whitechapel-road. On Friday, the 1st of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, and saw the prosecutor go up to him, and heard him say to him, "Can you tell me the nearest way to Tottenham-court-road, Bedford-square?" I had seen the prisoner a great many times before in the road; I knew him perfectly well, as a beggar - they went across to the wall - I was going to take a pair of shoes home, and when I came back I saw the prosecutor all over blood, in the road, and heard the beggar had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mrs. Evans of any business? A. She keeps a shoemaker's shop in Whitechapel-road. I was quite close to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose, from the prisoner's conduct, that he had any bad intention? A. Yes, I believed so - I did not raise any cry; I followed them as far as the London Hospital; I said to Mrs. Evans' son, who was with me,"We will watch him as far as we can - I think he is going to take his watch away;" it was not very dark, nor not very light.</p>

            . I am ten years old - (the witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of an oath). On Friday night, the 1st of February, between six and seven o'clock, I was with Langley, and live with my father and mother in Whitechapel-road, I know the prisoner perfectly well - I have seen him a great many times, he is a beggar - I saw the prosecutor and him together - I saw them just by Whitechapel work-house - I and Langley were buying a penny-worth of apples - I saw the prosecutor come one way, and the beggar the other; the prosecutor said, "Can you tell me the way to Bedford-square, Tottenham-court-road?" he said, "Come here,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210038"></xptr>my friend, I will shew you the way;" he spoke English very well - he took him across the road, just by the side of the London-hospital; then Mary said to me, "Jem, I think the beggar will thieve the man's watch;" he went across the road, and went towards Bedford-square, Commercial-road; I did not see him do any thing to him - we watched them, then left them, and went to deliver some shoes, and as I came by, I saw Monk leading the prosecutor home, all over blood, and his nose was cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see the prisoner do any thing to the prosecutor? No; he told me he was robbed.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a cooper - I live at Stratford, and work at Bow. I was going on an errand for my master, and saw the prisoner up by the corner of the hospital - I do not recollect ever seeing him before, but I am sure he is the man; I was going by and saw him and the prosecutor up in a corner - I went up to them, and the prosecutor was bleeding at the nose, and was all over mud; he was then leaning against the wall, to support himself; the prisoner was close to him - I saw the watch-ribbon in the prisoner's hand, and am sure he had the watch in his hand; I went to take the prosecutor away, and the prisoner struck me across the face, and asked what business I had with him - he struck me with his fist, and nearly knocked me down; the prosecutor had not complained of being robbed at that moment - I told him I would lead the man away, and when he found I would not leave him, he ran away, and when to fight the prosecutor, and finding I would not go away, he ran off as quick as he could, Mrs. Evans saw him one day, and pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not get up to the prosecutor till after he was robbed? A. No - I saw the ribbon and seals in the prisoner's hand, and he had the watch in his hand: he struck me across the face; the prosecutor was leaning against the wall - a woman came up and told me to take care of the man - the prisoner made away from us three, and ran; he had on a kind of work-house trousers, speckled, a jacket of the same colour, a kind of Scotch cap, and no shoes or stockings. I am a cooper, and am eighteen years old next June - I was going to Tyler's pork-shop to fetch some soveloys.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor tipsy? A. No; he did not appear very tipsy - he was very weak from the fall - he might have been drinking.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was all over blood and leaning against the wall? A. Yes; I saw a shuffling in the Court, and went to look, and only judge of his being tipsy by his staggering; that might be from the blow - I heard him speak when we asked where he was going - I do not think he was tipsy.</p>

            . I live with my father, an auctioneer at Bow. On the night in question, I was in Whitechapel-road - I came up with Monk, and saw the prosecutor bleeding and leaning on the palisades; I had no reason to suppose him tipsy - he was staggering from the blow - the prisoner was close to him - I am sure he is the man; I went up and said I would see the prosecutor safe, as far as I went; the prisoner asked what business I had there - I saw him push the prosecutor, and ask him to fight - this was after he was bleeding; the prisoner struck Monk on the face; I saw the ribbon and three seals, and I believe from the appearance, the watch was inside his hand: it was a dark red ribbon; he was going across Baker's-row, and there we lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner wanted to fight the prosecutor? A. Yes; for 5s. - he struck Monk on the cheek; he was about three minutes wanting to fight; he did not attempt to run away while he was wanting to fight; I saw the seals, and believe from his hand being clenched, the watch was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you distinguish three seals in the dark? A. There was a gas lamp there, and he held his hand down, and the seals hung out quite plain; I was pretty close to him, and saw them, but did not see the watch, his hand being closed; I did not lay hold of him; there was only Monk and a woman who came up there - it was not Langley, but a woman of the town: I don't live in the neighbourhood - I am seldom at Mile-end; I don't know whether any patrols go that road; there was no watchman up that side; I left the prosecutor just after seven o'clock about ten minutes after; I never saw the prosecutor before; nobody laid hold of the prisoner that I saw; we cried, Stop thief! two or three times, but there was nobody on that side, it is very seldom anybody is there; I led the prosecutor as far as the Bell foundry, then Mrs. Evans took him in and cleaned him I believe; the prisoner had on a pair of speckled trousers, and a jacket something of the same colour, it was between a brown and a blue.</p>

            . The prisoner has lodged in my house for the last nine or ten years. On the first of this month he came in about four o'clock in the afternoon, and did not go out again; he brought a red-herring in, roasted it by the fire, and went up to his bed-room with a bason of bot water, about five, and remained there; I went up about six to put some clean sheets on the bed; he was then on his knees, at prayer - I saw him; he backoned to me to shut the door after me; he was not out of the house all night; I went up about seven o'clock; he was then in bed; I did not see him afterwards till eight in the morning, and he did not come down stairs - he could not come down without coming through my room; I remained in the house all night; if he had come down after seven I must have known it, for I remained in my room; three other persons slept in the prisoner's room; he is a very honest, steady man, and was never out of bed after between six and seven o'clock at night; I never heard of his being charged with any theft - I never heard him speak a word of English in my life; he wore a pea-jacket, which he wears now - he made it himself, about four years ago - I never saw him in any other; I never saw him wear a cap in my life - he lodged with me till he was taken up, on the 12th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have not told us your occupation, and where you live? A. At No. 8, Essex-street, Whitechapel - my husband works in the West India Docks, when he has any thing to do; he was at home that night, but did not come in till after the prisoner; the prisoner is an Italian - I never understood a word he said, except "Madam;" he used to talk to me by signs.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210039"></xptr>Q. He has lived nine or ten years with you, and understands nothing of the English language? A. Nothing; when he wants any thing he speaks by signs to me; I never heard him say a word of English but "Madam."</p>
               <p>Q. What occupation is he? A. He walks about among the Jews, and they give him a few halfpence; I never saw him work; good people who know him, give him a trifle; my house is very near half a mile from the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not a beggar? A. He goes on; he cannot speak English to ask for any thing - if any body gives him a halfpenny he receives it; he puts his hand to his hat; he is a beggar, but not a thief; he never wears stockings or shoes - he is never out later than between four and five o'clock all the year long; he pays me 4d. every night for his lodging; he lives on a bason of hot water, a bit of bread, and sometimes a herring; I remember Friday night, the 1st of February, very well - I went to the police office about this, but the officer would not let me in; I did not say I was come to prove he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell where he begs generally? A. He generally goes among the Jews in Petticoat-lane; I never knew him beg by the London Hospital - I do not know that to be his beat; I have no other Italian beggars at my house; I may have twelve lodgers at present - I can lodge sixteen; I sleep in the bottom room - he lodges in the top room, up two stories high; my front door is always fastened between ten and eleven o'clock at night - it is open till then; they must come through my room to go out; I did not go out that evening; I went up stairs at six o'clock, and he was on his knees at prayer - I see him at prayer every night before he goes to bed - he was on his knees; I am not up there every night, but on this night in particular, I went up to put on the sheets - I have seen him at prayers scores of times.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember this night so well? A. Because I paid some money to my landlord, about three o'clock that afternoon, that makes me remember the day of the month; he did not come in in a hurry - it was a little after four o'clock, I am certain; he has never been later than between four and five all the nine years he has lived with me.</p>

            . I lodge in Mrs. Rankin's house, in Essex-street; I have lodged there for the last six weeks. On the 1st of February I was very ill in my bed; the prisoner came to bed at half-past five o'clock, and went to prayers; I remained there all night - he came to bed at half-past five, and was not out of bed till half-past seven next morning - I swear that positively; I am sure he did not go out of the room.</p>
               <p>COURT to HANNAH RANKIN. Q. Did the prisoner go up to bed when he came home? A. When he had eat what he brought in - that was a bason of hot water, and a herring; he eat that in my room below - he was there between half and three-quarters of an hour, I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT to RICHARD BALL. Q. What is your occupation? A. I am a labourer; I work by the water-side - I have no regular work, but a day's work now and then; I worked for Mr. Hacket, in the Minories, about two years, as a labouring man; I get my bread as I can by the waterside - I never beg.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us who you have worked for by the water-side, within the last six months? A. No. I never talked to the prisoner - he cannot speak a word of English - I never heard him speak English; I make signs to him; I had gone to bed in the day time, and did not get up till morning - I was in bed when he came home; I have no watch - I judge of the time; it could not have been about seven o'clock, for it was not dark; the lamps were not lighted - I did not see any; I was in bed - it was half-past five, as near as I can guess; it was quite light; I never saw the prisoner begging about - I never heard him say he begged; I cannot understand a word he says; I knew he was a beggar, but never inquired where he begged; Mrs. Rankin told me he was a beggar. I did not attend at Lambeth-street Office - I was never called upon; I still lodge there; I have not talked this matter over with Rankin at all, I am certain - I have come to prove the truth; she asked me to come here to speak the truth about the prisoner; I had no further conversation with her, than she asking me to come here, and state the case, and prove he was in his bed - I had no further conversation with her: I swear he was at home at half-past five o'clock, on the 1st of February, and in my room; and that he never went out of it - it was quite light at half-past five; he brought no candle up; the landlady came up at six o'clock, to put a pair of sheets on a bed - he had said his prayers before she came up, and gone to bed.</p>

            . I lodge at the same house as the prisoner, in Essex-street; I have slept in the same room with him since November last, but not in the same bed. I saw him on the evening of the 1st of February, in the room, when I came home from work, between five and six o'clock; I went up to my bed-room to put some things there, and he was in the room, on his knees, saying his prayers, by the bed-side; I saw him in bed afterwards, when I went to bed, and left him there at seven o'clock in the morning; in the evening, when I was in the room, he slipped off his knees, and was going to bed; I was in the room a little after eight o'clock, and he was in bed then - he could not have gone out in the night without passing my bed, which is close to the door, which will only partly open on account of my bed being near it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What trade are you? A. A labouring man; I have worked latterly for Mr. Page, of Mile-end, but am not in regular work - I porter about; the prisoner gets his living by charity; I do not know where he begs - it would take a very few minutes to run from the London Hospital to Mrs. Rankin's; I did not go to bed when I first came home; I have no place to sit; I have no watch - it was dark between six and seven o'clock; when I came in first, between five and six, he was in his room - it was not quite dark then; he was then at prayers, on his knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at what hour did he go to bed? A. It was then between six and seven o'clock; when I last came down from the room, I saw him slipping into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in bed when he was saying his prayers? - A. Nobody but me; he talks a good deal in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but when he was on his knees at prayers, he was out of bed? A. Yes; I was not at Lambeth-street Office - I have come here to speak the truth; Mrs. Rankin asked me to come; I have not talked this matter over with her, further than saying I would come; I was to come in consequence of sleeping in the same room as him - she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210040"></xptr>nothing to me about the 1st of February, nor asked me about the hour; we did not talk it over further than when I came home, she said he was taken; I did not hear of the robbery till he was taken; Mrs. Rankin never asked me to go to Lambeth-street - I did not go there; she asked me to come here a few days after the prisoner was taken - I never knew him out of bed after six o'clock; when he was taken I asked what it was for, and they said for a robbery, but I did not go to the office - I had no business with it; Mrs. Rankin said the robbery was done on Friday, the 1st of February; I do not recollect her mentioning the hour - I learnt the hour by hearing a man, at the Rose and Crown public-house, Essex-street, read the newspaper; to the best of my knowledge, I never talked with Mrs. Rankin about the hour: I went out between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I always leave him in bed - I never knew him wear any thing but the jacket he has on now; he wears neither shoes nor stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other man who goes without shoes and stockings? A. I have seen a man very much like the prisoner, but in a different dress, in a blue jacket and Scotch cap, and a very dark complexion - I believe that man had shoes and stockings on, but he resembled the prisoner very much, and put me in mind of him - he resembled him in features; I believe he is rather taller; I never drank with that man; I never talked with the prisoner - I cannot understand him.</p>

            . I live at No. 14, Tooksbury-place, Whitechapel. On the 1st of February, I saw the prisoner at No. 8, Essex-street - it might be from a quarter-past four to five o'clock: that is his usual time for going to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A labourer in the East India Company's employ; I am only a letterman there, subject to be discharged when the work is short - I have been there four or five years, but have been out of work seven or eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do in Essex-street? A. I occasionally go up there to see my mother, Mrs. Rankin, who keeps the house; she has been married twice; I fill up my leisure time by writing shop-fronts and boards - I had to do a board for Mr. Batty, and came down about it; the prisoner came and knocked at my mother's door, as was customary, and was told to enter - he never comes in without being told; the door is seldom open - the lodgers all knock; a person could go out without my mother knowing it, but not after being in bed; I did not attend at Lambeth-street, but several persons did - I was prompted through justice and humanity to come here; I heard of his being taken, on the Monday or Tuesday before he was committed; he might have been examined twice; but no person knew the charge till it was gone through - I did not hear of it till he was fully committed - I heard he was in charge, but did not know it was for a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not justice and humanity prompt you to attend the office? A. I was not acquainted with the full particulars, till he was committed; and I considered it useless to state what I knew, till the trial. I was never in a Court of Justice before. I never heard the prisoner speak a word of English in all my life - I have seen boys teaze him, and I have pushed him about. I wish to state that he is rather weak in intellect; for I have heard foreigners who lodged in the house say, he talks all manner of nonsense. My mother's lodgers are poor, working people; there may be others who beg. I have spoken to my mother respecting this, since he has been in confinement - I may have talked to her, on Saturday, respecting him. I was not much acquainted with the circumstance. I read the account in the newspapers; that is all I recollect about it. I have been here every day, and have no doubt but I have spoken every day respecting the trial; but we have not rehearsed the matter; we might say something respecting it. I did not see the prisoner go up to bed. I left the house a little before five o'clock. I have seen a man who bears a strict resemblance to him; his dress is something like his; but much better. I don't know where the prisoner generally walks; he goes to different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know his beat is about the London Hospital? A. I have as often seen him come other ways. I endeavour to shun him, for he always kisses my hand in the street. He don't constantly go to one place - I never saw him at the London Hospital - he may go there; I should think it is about five minutes walk from my mother's. I have seen him wear a pair of shoes down at heel; but he told a person, who understands him, that they hurt his feet.</p>

I never knew the prisoner out, after between four and five o'clock - he would come home with a red herring, roast it at the fire, and return God thanks for what he had taken, and then go to bed - I never heard him speak English.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know he prayed? A. He knelt on his knees - I have been in his room after he has been in bed, and I have seen him on his knees at the foot of the bed, when I have gone in at times for things that have been wanting. My husband is a broker - I work for Mrs. Rankin at times - he is sometimes on his knees for half an hour or more; I have left the room and gone up again, and found him still on his knees - I never saw him beg. Mrs. Rankin did not ask me to come here - I have not talked the business over with her; we spoke about the robbery when I first heard of it.

I opened the door, and remarked that he had a blue jacket on under that coat, and at the second examination, I remarked that he had shoes and stockings on - he then said to this woman, "Here, take those," and began to pull them off, but I stopt him from doing it - it is well known to all the officers that he talks English.</p>

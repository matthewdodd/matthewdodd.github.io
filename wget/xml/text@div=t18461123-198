                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and lodge at the Mitre coffee-house, Old-street-road. On the 3rd of Nov. I was near the Royal Exchange a man came up and asked me something—I walked with him to the Crown public-house—the prisoner and an old man came in there—(they did not appear to be acquainted)—the old man pulled some cards out of his pocket, which he called pictures—the party who was with me asked me where he got these cards from—they began to take some of the cards off and wanted me to have them—I said I would have nothing to do with them—the man said he had been at a brothel and these were for sale—the man with me pro<lb></lb>posed to go to some gardens, and we all went to the Yorkshire Stingo—they went up into a room and had the gas lighted—they had not been there long before they began to play at cards amongst their three selves—I had six so<lb></lb>vereigns and some silver—I did not tell them what I had got, but they got</p>

               <p>to know it by one of them pulling out a number of sovereigns, and the old man had a pocket-book with a great number of notes, or what looked like notes, in it—the other two said to the old man, "If you think you are in bad company we have got money"—I said, "have got tome money".—I took my hand out of my pocket carelessly—I do not know what I pulled out—I might have pulled out a couple of sovereigns and some silver, or it might be three or four sovereigns—they were playing at cards, and they asked me to play, but I would not—at last I was persuaded to bet two sovereigns—(they were playing for three or four)—I lost six sovereigns, and one which the man who went with me lent me, which was seven—the man then asked for his sovereign back—I had not got a sovereign, which he knew—they all said, "You must pay him, you will win it back"—I had to go and pawn my gold watch and chain to pay the sovereign—I pawned it for eight sovereigns—I went back and went up stairs—I took off my coat and put it down with the eight sovereigns in the coat pocket—I sat down—the party I had to pay the sovereign to stopped down stairs—I went down in a few minutes, and when I came up again I saw my coat had been disturbed—the prisoner and the old man were gone, and the money had been extracted from my coat pocket—no one had been in the room that could have taken them but the prisoner and the old roan—I went after the prisoner and found him in a road I do not know the name of—I watched him till I met an officer—I then went and asked him how he came to leave so abruptly—he said the old man was going to give him some ale.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Yorkshire Stingo. On Tuesday, the 3rd of Nov., four men came in and went up stairs—I told them I would light the gas—they ordered a pot of beer—I went down to get it up—shortly after the prosecutor came down and went out—I did not see him go out, but I saw him go up again—while he was out another of the party went out—they came back, and I saw the prosecutor go up stairs—the prisoner was one of the four in the room—the prosecutor came down again and asked if the men were gone out—I said yes—he asked which way they were gone—I said I did not know—he said they had robbed him of eight sovereigns.</p>

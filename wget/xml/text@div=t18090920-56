In a few minutes after the prisoner came into the warehouse, and went towards the privy, from thence he went towards a cask of tobacco, looked round and listened, then took the cover off the cask, and took a towell, and spread it on the floor; he then took two handsfull out of the cask, and put it in the towel, and took the tobacco and the towel up in the yard. In a few minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200027"></xptr>a cask where he took it from, and went out in the street. I called him back, and told him he had some tobacco about him; he said I know I have done wrong. I have taken some tobacco out of the cask, some I have concealed, and some I have got in my pocket; I hope you will not be severe with me. He was searched, two or three ounces were found on his person, the rest I found secreted in the back part of the warehouse in a tub. This is the tobacco.</p>

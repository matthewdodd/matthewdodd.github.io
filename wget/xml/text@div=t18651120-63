Sir, will you be kind enough to give directions that, if a small brown paper parcel is found that my brother had under the seat, on his return from Folkestone at the time of the accident, be sent to me here instead of to his residence at Light-water, Bagshot, Surrey. He was so completely stunned, as well as injured, that he was not able to see anything about it, and the parties who were kind enough to see him attended to say they never saw it. It contains shirts, brushes, &amp;c. Your attention to this will oblige, yours respectfully, J. L. Worth.")—("Prospect House, Lightwater, Bagshot, Surrey, 24/6/65. Sir, some few days ago I wrote you from Islington in respect to my brother's package, which has not come to hand; and as I am down at his house, they have requested me to apply again. He is still too ill from the effects of the accident to be able to see to matters himself, although somewhat better. If you have found it, will you please send it at your earliest convenience to be left at the Sunningdale Station. The accident has been a serious matter to him, as well as to other persons, but I hope he will get over it, although from the severe shock, he will never be the same man again. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, G. L. Worth")—("Prospect Cottage, Lightwater, near Bagshot, Surrey: Sir,—Your letter being sent to Islington, instead of here, has caused extra delay, but I beg to state that this being a scattered district you had better say "Immediate" on any letter you may send, as sometimes they are kept over for a day or two if they have not many this way. The nearest way to come here is either to Black-water or Sunningdale, from either place between five and six miles, as my brother's property joins Chobham-common, but is in Windlesham parish, about two miles and a half from Bagshot In the confusion when first wrote, I forgot to say, that in addition to the articles mentioned, a photograph of my relative's wife, with a number of private letters, were also in the parcel, which he hopes may yet be found. He is advised to go to Leamington, to his sister's, for further change, if able to go, but I cannot go with him before Monday. With regard to compensation for this matter, he wishes me to say that you can either do it with him or with his legal adviser, but he wants what is reasonable and fair between all parties, and if you think it can be amicably arranged for). he will agree to that, although he is sure he will be all that out of pocket. Your obedient servant, G. L. Worth.")—("Prospect House, Lightwater, Bagshot, Surrey. 6/7/65: Sir, Yours of the 3rd has just arrived at the time I was writing one to you, as my brother is getting out of all patience about his missing articles, and being in a very weak state is exceedingly fidgety. He has desired me to state that he named so low a sum in the last letter in order that no delay might arise, and legal proceedings be unnecessary, and I find his friends here blame him very much for saying anything like so small an amount, for it appears that he is not likely to be the man he was before the accident. The name of the medical man is Mr. Stewart, (successor to Mr. Blunt), who resides at the 'Folly,' Windlesham, Bagshot, Surrey, to whom you can communicate. My brother cannot be removed at present, but he is anxious to have his letters and a photograph, as well as his clothes, if possible; and as he thinks, poor fellow, that he will be able to go to his relatives at</p>

I therefore trust you will arrange matters so as to prevent his sending up to town for his solicitor, as I urged him to name a small sum to avoid law if possible. I am, Sir, yours truly, J. L. Worth.")—("12/7/1865. Prospect House, Lightwater, Bagshot, Surrey. Sir,—My brother again requests me to write you about his package, and desires me to say that unless he receives a satisfactory reply ho will place it out of his hands altogether, as he cannot help thinking the package would have been found if attention had been paid to it in the first instance, and the letters are of importance to him, as one in particular is a letter of acknowledgment for money of some amount, and therefore of importance to him. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, G. L. Worth <hi rend="italic">per</hi> J. F. Worth. N. B. Of course I am compelled to write what he tells me, as he is exceedingly nervous and excited at times. Do pray get it settled, as I am sure delay makes him worse. J. L. Worth")—("The Folly, West End, Chobham, Surrey. 29th July, 1865. John Adams, Esq.: My dear Sir,—Your letter being wrongly addressed, and my temporary absence, has caused some delay. Mr. John Worth has sustained injury to his head and shoulder, but is much better, although the shock has had a somewhat serious effect upon his system, which will require months to overcome. No danger need now be apprehended, but at first I deemed it advisable to have him kept perfectly quiet and away from most of his friends. Very faith-fully yours, C. J. Stewart.")</p>

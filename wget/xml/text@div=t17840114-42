Justice Wright sent for me, and the metal watch was produced.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner Welch before? - No, I had my eyes constantly upon him while he was in my shop, I suppose he was in my shop ten minutes, the other man I could not positively swear to, but I am sure this prisoner was one; when I went to Bow-street the prisoner was there, I said he was the man that was in my shop at the time, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Was your watch there at Bow-street. - Yes, not the cases, only the metal watch, I knew the watch.</p>

               <p>You did not hear him say any thing? - I said he was the man that was in my shop, and I said he had a mark on his hand, it was an anchor done with blue, which I took particular notice of when he was in my shop, it was a stain, I told the justice so, the justice desired me to look at his hand, I looked, and saw that anchor upon his hand.</p>

               <p>Begin what? - To speak about it, he was taken once before with Welch.</p>
               <p>How came Welch to be taken up upon this business? - Because he was concerned in something before.</p>
               <p>How did this come out against him at all; you understand the question well enough if you chuse to answer it? - Because he owed me money, and he would not pay it me, it was concerning a robbery that he had done at Hounslow heath.</p>
               <p>Did you inform against him for this? - No, not for this only.</p>
               <p>I am not asking you that, and you know it; did you give information against him for this fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the information to? - To a justice in the Borough.</p>
               <p>How came he to Bow-street? - We were taken from the Borough, to be carried up to Bow-street the next day; the justice desired me to speak all I knew. I did not like that way of living, I wanted to drop it if once I got out of it.</p>
               <p>It does not seem to be much, because you did not like the way of living, but because this man would not pay you the money; on your information he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of this indictment? - No, not this indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Welch. It is of no use to speak to him, he bears a very bad character, he was cast for death down at Plymouth, he was in gaol at Bristol; and I never was tried before a judge or jury before.</p>

               <p>Why to be sure a man must have a good memory for that? - The Justice wrote them down.</p>

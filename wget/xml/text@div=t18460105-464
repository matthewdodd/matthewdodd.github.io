                  </hi>. I am a guard of the London and Birmingham Railway. On Sunday, the 13th of July, I had a holiday, and spent it on the Railway to Brighton—I got back from Brighton a little before twelve o'clock at night—I had been drinking rather freely, and I walked up the Borough, instead of walking the other way from the railway—when I got to St. George's church two females followed me, and I went into a public-house with them—I came out again with one of them (the other had made off with my coat and silk handkerchief)—we walked a little way up Mint-street together and then, she left me—three men directly came up to me, and snatched my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—I am sure I bad it in my waistcoat-pocket when these men came up to me—I felt my watch going from me—the three men then ran away—I cannot identify them at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 241.) On the night of the 13th of July I was on duty in the Borough, in company with Delaney—I saw the prisoner in company with three others—I had known the prisoner before—I am quite certain he is the person I saw—Delaney and I saw three or four men together and saw a hustling match—the prisoner was one engaged in it—I did not know the prosecutor at that time, but he was one of the men engaged in it—the prisoner and two others ran away together one way, and the prosecutor ran or turned the other way—Delaney and I went up to the prosecutor and turned our lights on—he was the worse for liquor—I had pointed out the prisoner before to Delaney and he ran after him—I remained with the prosecutor—the prisoner was not brought back—he was out of the way till I apprehended him on the 28th in Gray's Inn-road—I knew the places the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the habit of frequenting in the Borough—I had been watching at those places to see him ever since, but I was not able to find him till I got in<lb></lb>formation which led me to Gray's Inn-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you off from the people whom you saw in this hustling match? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eighteen yards—I was in Mint-street—they were rather in Harrow-street—I considered these men were all the same party—when I got up, three went one way and the prosecutor the other—I then saw the prosecutor was the worse for liquor—he was standing still when we got up to him, and he put his hand to the remainder of his guard-chain or guard—I have not employed an attorney in this case—I think I know a young gen<lb></lb>tleman who has.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that a young gentleman who lives with the prisoner's wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as I know of—I do not know that from Cooper, the young man—it was not Cooper who pointed out the prisoner to me on the night he was arrested—I took a constable with me that night—I do not know that the prisoner has been in the hospital ill—this happened six months ago—I do not know that he has been seen by the police frequently since this, nor that he has since helped a policeman to take a man to the hospital who had taken poison—I do not know a man named Churchyard—I think I first saw Samuel Cooper about four months ago—I think he is a clerk—I never saw the prisoner's wife to my knowledge, nor a person whom I understood to be his wife—Cooper did not attend before the Magistrate as a witness—he was present—Cooper did not instruct the attorney to my knowledge—I suppose the attorney was instructed by whoever feed him—I suppose Cooper did—I know he employed him—he told me the prisoner was a bad member of society, and the sooner he went off the better—I should say Mr. Cooper is from twenty-four to twenty-eight years old—he may be older or younger, I do not know—he did not say that he should be able to enjoy the prisoner's wife—he did not tell me what his acquaintance with the prisoner was—I heard him say he was a relative of his wife's.</p>

On the 23rd of January, about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in King-street, Westminster—I saw Davis standing opposite to Mrs. Mitchell's house—the door was partly open—I thought it was not all right—I watched and saw her admitted into the house, and in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I saw her come out again with Browne—he went a little distance, and then parted from her—I let him get back into the house—I then went to Davis, and found the property stated on her—she had none when she went in—she said to me, "Will you have a cake or a biscuit?"—I said, "No"—she then said, "Will you have a <hi rend="italic">codger</hi>?"—I said, "What is that?" and she held up one of these loaves—I said, "You must go with me"—she said, "I am very willing, I have been with a man and he gave me these things"—I took her to the station—the sergeant went with me to Mrs. Mitchell's, and knocked at the door—Browne opened it—he said, "I am the guilty person, I did it, I ought not to have served my mistress so."</p>

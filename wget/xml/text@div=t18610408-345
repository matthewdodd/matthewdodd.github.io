                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother—I reside at 33, Wells-street, Mile-end New-town—about the middle of March last, I went into one of my bed-rooms and saw some blood on the floor—I spoke to my daughter about it—she did not say anything about it—I afterwards saw under my table a pail with some clothes in it, stained with blood—I spoke to my daughter about it—she said, "Mother, I will wash them"—on 19th March, I went upstairs with my sister to one of the bed-rooms to look for a cape, and put my fingers on the body of a child in a box—I sent for Dr. Champney—he did not come, and I sent for Dr. Edmunds—I then spoke to my daughter, and said, "Emma, what does this mean?—she said, "Don't ask me, mother"—my daughter is nineteen years old on 5th November next.</p>

I am sister-in-law to the last witness—in March last I went with her into one of the bed-rooms to look for a cape, and saw a baby lying in a box on its back—there was no covering over the face—the prisoner was not in the room whilst I was there—I did not ask her any questions after I had seen the child; she said nothing to me—I met her on the stairs, and she said, "Aunt, what is the matter with you?"—I said, "Emma, don't ask me"—we then came up into the bed-room, and I left her there talking to her mother—she said nothing to me as to who was the mother of the child—the mother asked her several questions, but I did not hear her answers.</p>

I am a member of the College of Surgeons—on 19th March I was sent for to Mrs. Papworth's—my assistant went, and I went at 9 next morning—I saw the body of a female child—it was of full mature growth—it was lying in a box on its back, on a petticoat, and covered by a silk cape—I afterwards visited the prisoner, two doors off—I examined her breasts and abdomen and found that she had been recently delivered—the</p>

Last Saturday night I lost seven cloaks about eight o'clock; the door of my shop, which was shut, and was upon the latch, was opened, and seven cloaks were stolen. I did not see the prisoner take them, but I saw her and the cloaks brought back about eight o'clock; I had seen the cloaks about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>You do not even know perhaps that the door was shut? - Yes; I had not been out of the shop into the parlour five minutes, and I am sure it was shut when I went out of the shop.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Beard, a pastry-cook, in Sydney's-alley, Leicester-fields. I was in Mr. Dixon's parlour when a poor woman came in and gave the alarm. I pursued the prisoner, and took her in Hart-street, Covent garden.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the shop? - An hundred or two hundred yards. She was running; I saw her drop one of the cloaks. She found somebody was after her and seemed to wish to drop them all. I catched hold of the other six.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the woman in the shop - I had not. The woman who came in and gave the alarm, said a woman was gone out with a bundle across the way and down the court.</p>

               <p>I was in the shop at the same time, it was about eight o'clock. There are cloaks hang<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060019"></xptr> across the shop, so that I could not see the door. A woman came in and said, there was no person to mind the shop, and a woman had stolen something. I ran out and pursued her; we caught her. One cloak dropped from her; I picked it up.</p>
               <p>How happened it that you who was in the shop did not see her come in? - I work in the back part of the shop, but the cloaks that hung up hindered my seeing.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the door open? - No.</p>
               <p>Had any person gone out of the door a little before? - No. I am sure the door was latched, because I was the last person who came in at the door.</p>
               <p>Can you be positive that you shut it? - Yes; I am positive.</p>
               <p>Does the latch catch so as never to deceive you? - I don't know that it ever did.</p>
               <p>How large is this shop? - Very large.</p>
               <p>And there were these things hanging loose about? - These cloaks laid close upon the counter folded one upon another.</p>
               <p>Had you any light in the shop? - Yes.</p>

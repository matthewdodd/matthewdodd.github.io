On Saturday the 11th of October, I turned a mare out on the common, about six in the evening; I went to look for her on the Monday following in the afternoon, and could not find her: I sought round our parish. On the Thursday I heard there was a mare at Bow-street, and I came up on the Friday morning, and applied at the office, and described the mare.</p>
               <p>Was that your mare? - I am certain she was. I have had her twelve months. She was a dun mare, with a black mane and tail; a long tail, and it was cut smooth even off at the bottom. I am positive to the mare. There was a remarkable scar on her withers: she was what they call three years old off.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - No.</p>

I was standing at the bar, and the prisoner came into my house for a pint of beer and some bread and cheese; I desired him to walk into the tap-room; he said can you lend me half a guinea upon my watch; says I, where do you come from; says he, Sir, I come from near Colebrook: I asked him to let me look at his watch, and he pulled it out of his pocket and gave it me; I asked Mrs. Errington for half a guinea's worth of silver, and I asked him if that was enough; he said it was: he said, I have a mare in your stable, I shall be glad to sell her: I went to look at her, and while I was looking at her he came into the stable; he said the price was nine guineas; I questioned him how long he had had this mare in his possession; he said twelve months last Uxbridge fair: he said he bought her of a man that said he came from Newbury: he said he had rode her some time, and that he was in the farming business, and that he worked with his father. I told him I thought the mare would not suit me. I examined her, and found her perfectly sound. I enquired of the hostler how the mare came there: the hostler told me that he had brought no saddle with the mare, but he had an old bridle to put in the withers. He said he had broke his girths, and he had left it at the collar-maker's at Hounslow to be mended, and said he told the man to get it mended against he came back. I consented to lend him a saddle, and I stood in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290097"></xptr> stable while they put a pair of stirrups to it. I asked him where he was going: he told me he was going into Hertfordshire, to find one Farmer

I told him Hertfordshire was a pretty extensive county, and he would be a good while before he found his friend out, and I could not spare my saddle: he said I had value enough. He wished again to sell the mare: I told him it would not do for me, and he went away. As soon as he was gone, the hostler came in and said, Sir, that man has cut part of the mare's tail off in the stable: I went in, and found he had scraped part off with a knife, and made her tail more of a switch. I then said, catch my horse immediately; I put on my boots and spurs, and followed him with a pistol in my pocket, and overtook him on this side of the Five-mile-stone, near to the

               <p>Prisoner's Council. I believe you are an officer belonging to Bow-street? - No, Sir, I have lived at Kilbourn many years.</p>
               <p>You say she was sore in the withers? - She had been pinched with an iron and rather sore.</p>
               <p>Then there was not a scar? - Yes there was a scar, my servant told me that the bit of the bridle lay upon her withers.</p>
               <p>Then it must appear to you to be a very recent injury? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>You said just now you understood it to be occasioned by the bit of the bridle being upon her back? - There was a scar upon the wither, and she was very tender upon it.</p>
               <p>There was nothing at all appeared particular in this mare more than others? - Yes, she is a slim mare, and a gentle mare, and she is rather heavy under the jaws, she was a dun mare with a black mane and tail, the prisoner told me she was four years old, and he bought her at three, I told him she was no such thing.</p>

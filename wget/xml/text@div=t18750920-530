I am a fanner at Eastcote, Middlesex—I occasionally lend money on bills of sale—some few days before 7th May the defendant was introduced to me by Mr. Utton, and he asked me to lend him 150., and I said if it was right I would lend it to him—on the second interview he said he wanted 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear, and he offered me a bill of sale for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was his own proposition, and that would include all expenses—I had some conversation with him at different times, and the substance of the conversa-tion was drawn up in writing in the form of the declaration—I was induced to part with my money from the representations that he made, and which are contained in the declaration—the declaration was signed before the money was advanced, and the statements in it induced me to part with my money—I should not have lent him the money if I had believed any one of those statements was not true—he asked me not to register the bill of sale because he was not a trader, and I did not do so.</p>

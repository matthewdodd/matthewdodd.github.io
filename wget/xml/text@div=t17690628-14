            . Between twelve and one in the morning, on the 10th of June, I was waiting for a man that had been with me; but leaning against a side of a house I fell asleep, near <placeName id="t17690628-14-crimeloc75">St. Dunstan's Church, Fleetstreet</placeName>

The prisoner standing by me, and no body else near me, I said, Good woman, you have got my watch. She said she had not seen me. I felt in her bosom and felt a watch. I desired her to give it me, but she would not. I offered her a guinea to give it me. She snatched it out of my hand, and would not return either. Some company coming up, I saw her give the guinea to a man. I called the watch, and gave charge of the man and the prisoner, who were both carried to the watch-house. Before my Lord Mayor she denied all. The man was acquitted there. I am certain I had my watch in my pocket before I fell asleep.</p>

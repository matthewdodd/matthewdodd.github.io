                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday morning, the 20th of June, about half-past one o'clock, I was High-street, Bow, in the parish of St. Mary, Stratford—I was at the further end, near Bow-bridge, looking up the town, and saw the prisoner come from about the spot where Mr. Sturgeon lives—he appeared to have something in his hand—he was a few yards from the house when I saw him—it might be five yards—I did not see any body with him—there was not a soul moving about the town—I followed him up the town, and saw him go to his father's door—his father is a jobbing carpenter, and lives nearly knocking—I knew who it was, and did not go to him—I returned a few steps, and waited—about two o'clock I had occasion to go to a shop opposite his father's house, and he was still knocking at the door—two more of our men came up to me, and said something—the poisoner then walked away—we went across the road, and saw some fowls lying close against where he had been standing, at his father's door—there were five live ones and two dead ones one with the head pulled right off—the prisoner went to the corner—one of the policeman, who is not here, went to lay hold of him, and he ran away—the man sprang his rattle—I went to his assistance, but the prisoner got right away from us—he ran through Bow Church-yard, and directly he got away I went back and picked up a white pillow-case over blood, with white feathers of fowls in it—it was in a narrow passage in the church-yard through which he had run—I took him into custody on Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning the 21st, which was next direction in Whitechapel—I am quite sure he was the man I saw come in a direction from Mr. Sturgeon's house, and afterwards run from his father's door—I have known him many years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the White Horse at Bow. My mother, Martha Sturgeon, keeps the house—on the 19th of June I fastened the house up between eleven and twelve o'clock—the hen-house joins the dwelling-house, and is under the same roof—you go from the kitchen into the hen-house though a door—it is all enclosed, and under the same roof as the dwelling-house which is tiled—you go into hen-house without going into the open air—there is a bed-room over the hen-house—the hen-house</p>

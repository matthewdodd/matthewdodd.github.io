                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper at the Grand Junction Canal, at Harefield. On Saturday morning, the 26th of Sept., the prisoner came to my lock—Norman was there—the prisoner came forward to pull the lock—the lock was not ready to receive the boats, and Norman asked the prisoner what was the reason he did not come sooner to get it ready—the prisoner and Norman worked in a different pair of boats, but both belonged to one master—they had words, and called each other liars, and then Norman called the prisoner some name that I could not understand—the prisoner answered, "Can you make me one?"—Norman said yes, he could, and immediately threw off his cap, and doubled his fist to fight the prisoner—the prisoner had not then done anything, but called Norman names—they walked away from the lock, round the corner of the palings, where I could not see them, and were fighting for some minutes, and then I went over from my side of the lock, and told them they had a great deal better leave off fighting, and follow their boats; they had had enough of that I thought—the prisoner immediately said, "That is just as he likes"—Norman made an answer which I was not near enough to understand—they went from there into the meadow, and were there some time—I was out of sight of them—I then went into the road, and saw Norman's brother trying to lift him up—his brother had repeatedly, in my hearing, begged him to leave off fighting—I could not hear what reply Norman made to that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of William Norman, who died the quarrel began about the lock not being ready—the prisoner said it was not his place to fill the locks—my brother told him it was—the prisoner said he was a liar—my brother said he was not, and he said, "You are a liar, and a b——y liar"—the prisoner replied, "Can you make one of me?"—my bro<lb></lb>ther said, "Yes," and he threw off his cap, and doubled his fists, and began to square at him—I begged him not to fight at all—I said, "There wants no fighting;" but he would, and he and the prisoner went down the road, a little distance from the lock—I got my lines ready, and went down after them<lb></lb>they got into the meadow, and began fighting again—my brother pulled off his shirt—he would not leave off—the prisoner had pulled off his shirt in the road—I went into the field, and begged my brother to leave off—he struck at me, and said he would have another round or two—they began to fight again, and fought for ten minutes, I dare say—when my brother said he would have another round or two, the prisoner said as he liked about that—he seemed willing to give it up—they fought a few rounds, and in the last round my brother tumbled down backward, and lodged his elbow in the ground for a minute, and all at once he fell back like a person in a fit—he made a kind of gurgling in his throat, and I never heard any more from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was called upon to examine the body of William Norman—I found contusions about his face, but not, apparently, sufficient to cause death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the vessels of the brain in a highly congested state, and an extensive extravasation of blood in the ventricles of the brain—I considered the cause of death in the flow of blood into the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He died, in point of fact, from apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I consider the rupture was occasioned by external violence—the vessels of the brain got very full of blood which caused congestion—there was a rupture—the flow of blood from the vessels to the brain was the cause of his death<lb></lb>the cause of the congestion might be extreme excitement—in making a blow at his brother he might have brought on the congestion which ultimately ended in the rupture, and being a person of intemperate habits the vessel were more likely to rupture than in any man of other habits.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper. On the 18th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutors came to my shop - I sold them some things; one of them had a bundle; they were about half an hour in the shop. The prisoner came in, and looked at some calico, which he said would not suit him. I was attending to some customers, and saw the prisoner take the prosecutors' bundle off the counter, and run off with it - he was followed immediately. I lost sight of him, and saw him again ten minutes after with the bundle.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the corner of Dock-street, in Well-street, about three hundred yards from this shop; he was running, and some sailors were following him - they produced the bundle, and said he had stolen it - he denied it.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the shop - Smith said he had taken it; I pursued, and took it from under his coat. The constable took him about ten minutes after. The people were calling Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see anything but his back - A. He ran out with it. I am sure he is the man.</p>

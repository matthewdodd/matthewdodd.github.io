The prisoner was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money, which he had to bring to account every night when he balanced the day-book; on the 5th of May he accounted for no money received from Mrs. Cole; he should have put it into the till with the duplicate - the duplicate she brought is not to be found, nor is it entered off - the prisoner should have taken it out of the till at night, and give it to the person who keeps the books to enter it off; he keeps a daily settling-book, and casts up the amounts of principal and interest, and hands them to the boy; I had him searched last Friday week, and we found on him this duplicate of Cole's, among several others; I accused him of having stolen the principal and interest, which he acknowledged and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was your accusation respecting any particular duplicate, or the whole? A. I said, "I shall be able to bring this case home to you"- I did not say he might as well tell at once; he has authority to take one guinea a week from the till, debiting himself with it; there is nothing due to him; the person receiving money for duplicates writes on them, and this is his writing on it - it is 1d. - that proves he received interest and principal - I have two other shopmen.</p>

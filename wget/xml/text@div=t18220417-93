            . I am a tide-waiter at the Customs, and had charge of the lug boat Frederick, on the 4th of March, in the basin of the West India Dock, eleven puncheons of rum were in it; Salter was an <rs id="t18220417-93-deflabel471" type="occupation">Excise waterman</rs>

Salter walked across to the Maunder as soon as he saw me going aft; Jennings was walking on the Maunder, Salter said something to him, and when I called the officers to my assistance, they both went into the Maunder's cabin, I saw them both come out together and lean over, and one of them threw something over into the water, it floated, and then something was thrown in which sunk; I said to Salter you have made a pretty thing of it; he said, I had a d - d sight to say about it; nobody was near the Maunder but Salter, he was within eight feet of it; Culverhouse picked up the thing which floated, it was two large bladders; we took them into custody; Roebuck searched the Maunder and found a bladder smaller than the one which was full of rum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You never saw Jennings out of his boat - A. He has got the palsy in one arm; the rum was running when I discovered it; Salter got over two or three lug boats into the Maunder - it was moon-light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How many vessels were there in the bason - A. I do not know, the Joseph laid a-head of the Maunder - I was walking on the quay to keep myself warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these men in the habit of passing from one vessel to the other to keep themselves warm - A. They walk on their own vessels, but not from one to another; I have seen them do it - I had been walking about for a quarter of an hour on the quay.</p>

I afterwards went into the Maunder, Roebuck came out of the cabin with the skin in his hand, I pulled two bladders out of the water just a-stern of the Maunder. I heard Finch say to Salter that he had made a pretty thing of it; he said he had a d - d sight to say about it.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. - Q. There were many other boats in the bason - A. A great many, most of them touched each other; there were four excise watchmen in charge of different boats, including the prisoner's, no other vessels had a cargo.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now out of a situation—in May last I was servant to Mr. Wells, at 17, Charing Cross—the prisoner worked there as charwoman, but I did not first become acquainted with her there; my mother knew her first—my mother has married again, and has gone to America—I told the prisoner that I expected money from America from my mother, for me and my brother and sister to go over to her—I did not know how much—I left Mr. Wells' service, and went to live at Bath—I had not then received any letter from my mother containing money—I got a letter from my mother just before Christmas, and then came up to London and saw Mr. Watts—I went with him and Chalkley, the constable, to 5, Tur-ner's Court, and saw the prisoner—she said "What is this for?"—he said "It is for the cheque you have cashed in Margaret Gleeson's name"—she said "Don't take me, because of my children"—I have seen the prisoner write, and have had several letters from her—this signature, "Margaret Gleeson, "on the front and back of this cheque is her writing—I had never seen the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave evidence before the Magistrate and also here last Session, when the Jury could not agree (<hi rend="italic">see vol.</hi> lixvii., <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 390)—I said at Bow Street, "It is not my writing; it looks like the prisoner's writing"—I was certain that it was the prisoner's writing—I am living now in Regent Circus with a friend, Mrs. Harley—she is married—she is not in business—I left my situation in Bath when I came up to these Sessions—I could not go back in consequence of this case; my master could not be troubled so many times about my coming backwards and forwards from Bath—Mr. West has not called on me since the trial—I have not seen him—I first became acquainted with the prisoner when I was living in Scotland Yard—I have a sister who is deformed, but she has always earned her living while she was with the prisoner—I have taken her away—she is fifteen now, and she has been with the prisoner three years—she broke her leg while with the prisoner, and went to the hospital; and while she was there my mother was obliged to go to America and leave her there—I do not know that the people at the hospital were about to send my sister to the workhouse—the prisoner had her back for her own use—she was not as kind as a mother to her; she knocked her about shamefully—she was kind to her before my face—I do not remember whether I said last Session that she was as kind as a mother to her—I was in the family way when I was with Mr. Wells, but that has nothing to do with the prisoner thieving my money—the prisoner was sent for to Mr. Wells, but I did not go to her house and be confined there, I went to the Union—when I came out of the Union I went to the prisoner's house with my baby, but I did not sleep there—I did not remain at the house till I got a situation—I remained there about a fortnight; it may have been three weeks—I did not go straight from her house to my situation, I went into the country and stayed there a week, and she wrote me a letter to say that the bed was let to a gentleman, and I could not go back again—I told the Jury I did not sleep with the prisoner, but I slept in the house, up stairs with the landlady—the prisoner was as kind as a mother to me and my baby, but that is no reason why she should rob me—I did not pay her one single farthing, but she pawned my clothes, and my sister's, too; she has got them out now, but I had to go to a Magistrate first—nobody has been speaking to me about this case since last time—you asked me these questions last time, but I said nothing about pawning the clothes</p>

               <p>because you would not let me speak; you told me to hold my tongue when I was speaking—my mother used to write to the prisoner from America, and she used to write to my mother—there was no other servant at Mr. Wells's to go away in the family way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not occupy the whole house, only lodg-ings—I did not sleep in her lodgings, but in another part of the house—I paid the landlady for my bedroom, and boarded with the prisoner—she said that it did not matter till I got a situation—I did not give her any of my clothes to pawn, she took them out of my box—I was not aware of it till I got my box, and then I wrote to her and got no answer, so I went be-fore a Magistrate—the prisoner never made any claim on me for money—I never owed her anything—she said that she would keep my sister, and no one should have her—she has worked for the prisoner as a servant, and I found her clothes, and as fast as I did so the prisoner pawned them—the prisoner had the benefit of her services for her board and lodging—I was confined on 16th May—I had been in Mr. Wells' service a year and eight months—he is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 17, Charing Cross—the prosecutrix was in my service, and the prisoner was occasionally employed there as charwoman—after Gleeson left, in May last, a letter came for her—I cannot say whether I saw one or more—I saw one undoubtedly directed to Margaret Gleeson—I saw an address on it, and the postmark was "Auburn, New York"—I gave it to some of my men to take it to the prisoner—I did not know anything about its containing money—I after-wards received a letter from Mrs. Carr, Margaret Gleeson's mother, and after that I went to the prisoner's lodging and told her that I had received a letter from Ellen Carr, enquiring if a letter was forwarded to Margaret Gleeson at my house, containing a cheque for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not remember whether I showed her the letter or read it to her—she said that she had had the letter, and, acting under advice, she had been to the bank and got the money, as she considered the prosecutrix was in her debt, and she bad appropriated it to her own use—after that I went with the prosecutrix to Montague's bank, Old Broad Street—I also told the prisoner that she had done wrong—she said she was quite justified—she gave me no particulars of what sum Gleeson was indebted to her—I afterwards went with the con-stable and Gleeson to the prisoner's house—I cannot recollect what her words were, but she admitted having had the money, and begged not to be taken in custody—Gleeson had left my house in the family way, and I sent for the prisoner on that occasion, when we suddenly discovered it—I have never been charged with being the cause of the girl's misfortune, nor have</p>

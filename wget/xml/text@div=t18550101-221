                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). On Monday night, the 18th Dec, about half past 7 o'clock, I was on duty in Stratford; I saw the prisoner near a marine store shop—I went and hid myself in a dark place—I saw the prisoner go into the shop—it was Mr. Rayner's marine store shop—I followed the prisoner in and he was putting some brass letters into the scale, and a quantity of brass beading; I examined it, and asked the pri<lb></lb>soner how he came by it—he said he found it in some dust—I said it had recently been broken off somewhere—he then said, "I shan't tell you how I did come by it"—I took him to the station—he gave me his address, and I went to his lodging and found these two iron plates—I found the brass corresponded with these iron plates, the name of the "Rob Roy"—I found at his lodging a hammer and chisel, and in his pocket, some more letters, and some brass beading.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, in the employ of Mr. Thomas Pearce. I have seen this brass, and these iron plates;—I know them all, they are all Mr. Pearce's—they came from a locomotive engine, belonging to Mr. Pearce—I had not seen the engine at all for three months, till Christmas day—the plates were then taken off, and the letters too—when I had seen it before, it was all right—the name of the engine was the "Rob Roy."</p>

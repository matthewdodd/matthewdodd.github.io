                  </hi>. I am a sailor on board the <hi rend="italic">Allen</hi> of Newcastle—the prisoner was carpenter belonging to the same ship. On the 10th of Octo<lb></lb>ber, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was on board—the prisoner came on board and called me lazy—I had been laid up three days with a bad foot—I told him I was not lazy, and he came and struck me in the face with his hand and cut my lip—he told me if I would come on deck he would give me a good hiding—I struck him afterwards—we exchanged blows—we went down into the forecastle after that, and I sat on his cabin-box—he told me to get up, he would not let me sit on that—I did not get up at the exact time he spoke, and he came and pulled it from underneath me—he took his chisel out, and ran and struck me in the nose with it—it cut me—I struck him afterwards—I was not carpenter's mate.</p>

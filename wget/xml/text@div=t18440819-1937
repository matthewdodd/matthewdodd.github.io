I came from Oxfordshire to London after work—I was out of work three weeks—on Sunday, the 4th or 5th of Aug., I was without work or lodging—I was uncommonly tired and fatigued—my feet ached very much—I went into the park and slept under a tree—in the morning the prisoners came to me and awoke me—I said, "Halloo"—they said, "Halloo" again—they had a little <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>, and I got up and was going away—they caught hold of me round the waist—Fuller threw me down, and took my money out of my pocket—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two penny-pieces—he gave it to one of the women—I do not know what the women did to me—Fuller never struck me at all—they then walked away—I followed them</p>

               <p>into Oxford-street, found a policeman there, and gave them in charge—the two women ran away—he gave the man into another policeman's hands, while he went after them—two penny-pieces were afterwards produced, which I thought were mine—before he took the women, I told the constable there were notches in one, and one was scraped with a knife—the women did not do anything to me—they fell on the top of me.</p>

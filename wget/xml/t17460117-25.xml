            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dugard. I was at work at Mrs. Lacy's that Day, and when I had done my Work, I went up to make her Bed; after that I lock'd the Door and went up another pair of Stairs to make another Bed; but coming down I saw Mrs. Lacy's Door open, (at which I was surpris'd) and the Curtain bulk'd out as if somebody had hid himself. Upon that I went down and told the Maid, I was afraid somebody was in the Room. We were afraid to go by ourselves, we call'd the Man, and all three went up, and we miss'd the Things off the Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Dugard. a pair of Sheets off the Bed, a Pillow and Pillow-Case.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of them?</p>
               <p>Dugard. No, my Lord. But the Pawnbroker Mr. (Wight) came to inform that a Sheet was brought to him.</p>

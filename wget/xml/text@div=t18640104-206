                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 263).

"Why not have paid the money due to Mrs. Davis, when you had received it on her account?"—he said "I wished to pay it altogether"—I then took him to the station.</p>

I was not successful, and I did not like to go back. I stopped away till Monday morning, and then I wrote a letter to Mrs. Davis, asking her if she could give me a week or two, and I would try and settle up—on the Tuesday I came down to see Mrs. Davis, and as soon as I got into the town the officer took me. I said I was going up to see Mrs. Davis, to see if I could arrange with her. Mrs. Davis came down to the station. My mother offered to pay 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she had in hand of mine for wages, but she would not accept it. I wished to pay, and would have done so, if I had bad time.</p>

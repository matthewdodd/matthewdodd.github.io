               <p>Q. Did it turn out to be a part of that which was sold to you on Tuesday? - A. It did; we found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240011"></xptr>it hid in some clover-hay in the lost; two two-gallon casks of rum, a stone bottle of rum, and several other bottles with shrub, and others with gin, and a tap-tub, were covered over with some rubbish.</p>

             sworn. - Knowing that we had lost a much larger quantity than we found in the hay-lost, on the 12th I went into the prisoner's lodgings with a warrant, and while the constable was searching the lodgings, I occasionally put my hand upon the sugar-bason, and found these two pieces of sugar, which I am as confident, as I am standing here, was part of the parcel that was taken away. (The two pieces produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Hubert.) Q. Will you have the goodness to look at these two pieces? - A. I believe them both to be the sugar that we sold to Messrs. Langdale.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. By what sugar-baker was it baked? - A. By Gibson and Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240012"></xptr>Q. Has Gibson and Co. a patent to bake sugar different from all other sugar-bakers? are there no sugar-bakers that have sugar of the same quality? supposing that you had heard nothing at all of this charge, and I had met you any where, and I had shewed you this lump of sugar, should you have been able to say that they were of the parcel of sugar that was stolen from Messrs. Langdale? - A. Only by comparing them with the same sugar we had sold to Messrs. Langdale.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first sugar whatever made of that quality? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sold from Gibson and Co. sugar of the same quality with that in your hand? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not every sugar-baker in London bake sugar of the same quality? - A. It is likely.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the quality and the mode of baking it, you believe it to be the same? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langdale. With respect to the key of the stable, I, on the Monday had occasion to go to look at the horses; the man was at his dinner; I could not get in, I have had an hundred quarrels with him for taking the key of the stable with him to dinner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The evidence has said it was generally open in the day time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langdale. With respect to the rum, I have tried them, they are of the same quality with that in the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the affair; my master has a key of the stable, and I have a key; sometimes the stable door is locked, and sometimes open.</p>

                  </persName>. I am ft bricklayer, and lire at 58, Upper George Street, East Greenwich—about 3 o'clock p.m., on the 24th March, I saw the prisoner cross the road from the top of Tiley Street towards the railway with a basket on his head with some bacon in it—he dropped it over the railway fence, took the bacon out of the basket, and scrambled up the embankment with it—he left the basket behind—he then took the bacon from under his coat, and hid it under some timber; he came down the bank, took up the basket, and pushed it between the top bars of the fence into the road—he got over the fence into the road, picked up the empty basket, staggered halfway across the road, and then made a pretence to fall; he regained his feet and walked sharply down Edward Street—I followed him some distance and then went back to the spot where he had put the bacon—I had a friend with me—we found the bacon there—the prisoner came back to the place about half-an-hour afterwards—he did not find the bacon there, as my friend had moved it—he was looking amongst—the timber—I went up to him and said "I want you"—he aid "What for?"—I said "Here comes a policeman, you come to him and he will tell you"—a constable came up and I told him what I had seen—my friend produced the bacon from where he had put it—the prisoner said he did not know anything about it—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at 7, North Terrace, Telegraph Road, East Greenwich—this piece of bacon is a portion of a larger piece which I missed on 24th March last—the piece "weighed 22 or 24 lbs. and was worth about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed it between 1 and 4 o'clock on the 24th—I had seven middles of bacon on a tub near the door, and this piece corresponds exactly with the invoice weight, it makes up the exact weight of the whole.</p>

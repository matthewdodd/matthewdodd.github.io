                  </hi>. I live in White Rose-place, Lower Whitecross street, and am a porter at New gate-market. On the 25th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, I put twelve fowls into a hamper, which I placed on the top of another hamper in Mr. Walter's cart, in Newgate street, at the corner of the Old Bailey—it was just day-break—I had oc<lb></lb>casion to go away for about a quarter of an hour—on my return I missed the fowls and hamper—I went up and told Mr. Walter directly—among the fowls which I had put in, there were three small ones—I afterwards saw the twelve fowls in the possession of the constable, at worship-street—I am certain they were the same.</p>

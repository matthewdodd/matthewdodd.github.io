                  </hi>. I live at 184, Blackfriars Road, and am a registered medical practitioner—about 10 o'clock on Saturday evening, the 16th of October, I was sent for to 30, Queen's Street, Blackfriars Road—I went to the first floor room and saw the prisoner there, and found a woman lying on the floor whom I since knew to be Naomi Youell—she was quite dead—I used every means to restore her, but life was quite extinct—I could not at that time see the cause of death—I could only see a very slight abrasion over the right eye, and on the wrist, which would not in the least account for death—I asked the prisoner if she had been ill and taken medicine—he said no—he said she had been well up to that evening—the expression of the face looked so quiet that I thought death had happened from prussic acid—we made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I found two small abrasions on the forehead, one over each eye, on the outer part of each wrist, and two small abrasions on the left knee about the size of a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, but no blood had issued from it—the vessels of the brain were very much congested—we bund a large clot of blood in the right ventricle; that had produced apoplexy—my firm opinion is that the cause of death was apoplexy—the lot of blood did not correspond with any mark of violence in the slightest degree—the vessels of the brain were generally in an unhealthy state, I might say diseased, which would render her more liable to an attack of apoplexy—the apoplexy might have been produced by the excitement of a quarrel without any blows—her stomach was very nearly empty, and the liver was very unhealthy—a fall against a table or a box, or a trunk would be very likely to produce those abrasions which I saw over the eye—there</p>

               <p>was a large quantity of blood diffused over the brain, more especially in the right ventricle—I don't think it would take long to cause that—I should think a quarter of an hour in a case like that—it was merely a slight abrasion of the outer cuticle, not at all deep, there was not any bleeding—I should think it impossible that it could have been produced by a blew that would be heard by a person who did not see it, but who was in a neighbouring room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live with my father and mother on the ground floor No. 30, Queen's Street, Blckfriars Road, and the prisoner lived with his wife Naomi Youell, in the first floor front room—we had lived in that house two years, and they came the week after we did—on Saturday night, the 16th of October, about 8 or 9 o'clock, I was in the kitchen in the basement—I went up to the ground floor and listened. because I heard quarrelling upstairs—the prisoner's door was shut—I stood about a dozen steps down—it is a very narrow staircase—I heard the prisoner say "Where have you got the drink from"—then I heard Mr. Youell say "I have no more drink in me than you"—then I heard blows, and then a noise as if it was a fall, and I heard her say "You spiteful wretch, oh, my God, you are a spiteful wretch;" after that all was quite—I heard him walk<lb></lb>ing about the room—this took about a quarter of an hour—after that I heard the prisoner say "I will give you more before I get you between the sheets—then I heard blows again and three groans and a kiss—after that the prisoner opened the door, came down, and asked for Mr. Baker, and I told him Mr. Baker was not in, but father was—he said "Mr. Baker, will you come up, there is something the matter with my wife"—my father and I went up and found a candle in the room and Mr. Youell leaning against the wall with her head resting sideway against the table—my father said she is dead—the prisoner said "Good God, is she?"—my father went for the doctor, Mr. Smith—the prisoner remained alone with his wife till the doctor came—I went into the room again—at that time the body was taken from the chair and laid down on the floor—the prisoner was pouring brandy into her mouth—the doctor said it was no use—the prisoner said she had fallen over a box on to the chair—he also said "I did not do anything to her."</p>

I heard the sound of a blow; it sounded to me as if it was a blow by the fist against the clothes, against the body somewhere—his wife had been in half an hour before him—he did not ask me if his wife was tipsy—there has never been any intimacy between myself and the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I examined the body with the other surgeon on the 16th of October—I could see nothing externally to account for death—I saw two abrasions over the right eye about the size of a shilling—if any blow had been given I think I should have found the impress, there was nothing of the sort—I found the whole of the brain highly congested, and a large clot in the right lateral ventricle of the brain—she died from natural causes, from apoplexy, that I am firmly convinced of—any excitement would bring it on, it might take a minute, it would be the last drop that would cause it—I saw no sign of injury to correspond with that clot—I examined her liver; it was a gin drinker's liver, what we call a hob-nail liver.</p>

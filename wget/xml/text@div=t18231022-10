On Monday, my servant gave me information, and I marked 20 s., in shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns, and put them into the till on Tuesday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, before business began; there was no other money there. At nine o'clock I looked in the till, and missed three shillings, and between eleven and twelve o'clock missed two more, and sent for an officer - he was searched in the parlour, but not in my presence. My marked money was produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you married - A. I am a widow. My daughter and a young woman serve in the shop; but he never does - his business is to deliver bread, and bring home the money; he was very punctual in his accounts. My daughter was not in the shop that morning. I scratched some of the money with a pen knife, punched some with a gimblet, and marked some with the letter W.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Iliff. The prisoner never served behind the counter, and had no business there; he slept in the house, and was up all night. On Tuesday, about nine o'clock, when he was going out with the bread, he pulled me out of the corner; I saw him put his hand into the till, take something out, and put it into his bosom - I told my mistress of it; she was in the shop at the time; she looked into the till, and stood close by him - he came round, and took some bread<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220009"></xptr>out of the window; but he should have asked me to hand it over the counter to him. He went out directly, and returned in half an hour. The constable was afterwards sent for. My mistress's daughter was in the parlour all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you and him good friends - A. Always. He took the money before my face; I said nothing to him, but thought it best to tell my mistress, and told her immediately. I had seen something done on Saturday, which I did not mention till Monday. I am her niece. Nobody else was charged with this - nobody was searched but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MRS. ILIFF. I examined the till after Billing told me, and missed 3 s., and two more between eleven and twelve o'clock, then called the prisoner into the parlour, and sent for an officer. Nobody but the prisoner was searched.</p>

I am a tobacconist, and live next door to Mrs. Iliff - she fetched me about eleven o'clock, and I fetched the constable, and saw him search the prisoner in the parlour, and find 23 s. 6 d. in his trowsers pocket, and 2 s. in an inside waistcoat pocket, near his breast; one of them was marked; Mrs. Iliff claimed it; he said nothing to the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say it was a false charge - A. He did not; he had a flannel jacket, and a waistcoat with a breast inside pocket. I do not recollect whether both shillings were marked.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched, and found the prisoner in the parlour, and told him he was charged with robbing the till; he made no answer. I found 2 s. 3 1/4 d. in his inside waistcoat pocket - Mrs. Iliff claimed them immediately, and said how they were marked - they were then in her sight. I searched a pair of his trowsers up stairs, and found a sovereign and three shillings; she claimed two of the shillings - he said nothing to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She told you how she marked the money - A. She said she could swear to the mark.</p>
               <p>MRS. ILIFF. I can swear to two of the shillings found in his pocket - they are what I put into the till; two of those found in his trowsers are also marked, and mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. One has a scratch across the head, is that your mark - A. Yes; another has a punch mark. I had marked them overnight.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had he an opportunity to go up and change his trowsers - A. He did not change them; he was at home an hour and a half, and could go up stairs; the men have a room to themselves. The till was locked, but the key left in it; the servant said he pulled her from the corner to get to it.</p>

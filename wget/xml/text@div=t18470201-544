                  </hi>. I live in Lower Simonds-street, Chelsea. On the 4th of August the prisoner came and knocked at my door—my wife let him in—he came in the name of M'Gan, he said he was my wife's brother, and he was glad he had found his sister—my wife said she did not know she had a brother—she had him in and made much of him—he remained till the Friday evening—he then absconded, and we missed two silk handkerchiefs and a pair of stockings—he stated that he had brought two feather beds and a piece of linen for sheeting from my wife's friends in Ireland, and be borrowed a sovereign on the Wednesday to go the Docks to release those thing and bring them, but he did not bring them—I found him on the 15th January, and gave him into custody—he acknowledged he took the handkerchiefs, but not the stockings—my wife had left Ireland 24 years ago, when a child, and she did not know whether she had a brother—the prisoner could tell all her rela<lb></lb>tions better than she could herself, and she had a letter about a week before he came to say he was coming, and she thought everything he said was true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner coming to his house in Aug.—he said he had come from Ireland, and had got some beds and some sheeting, that he had been a sergeant in some regiment in India, and had got a great deal of property from there, silks and satins, and everything else, and a great quantity of jewellery—he got a sovereign on the Wednesday to go to the docks to get thing out—he said they were <hi rend="italic">quarantined</hi>—he introduced himself as one of the family—he said my mistress's father had married another party in some other part, and he was her brother—he stopped, and was made very much of, till Friday, when master was gone to town he made off—I missed the handkerchiefs and pair of smoking—I recollect the prisoner took up the handkerchiefs and rubbed them to his face to see if they were India handkerchiefs—he said they were not India as his were.</p>

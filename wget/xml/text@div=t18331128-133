            . I was Lord Bristol's house-steward, and was at Ickworth, in October - there is a box for the letters which has a lock and key - I kept the key - there was only one key to my knowledge - if a letter was put into it and required to be taken out again, I was applied to to open the box - on the 9th and 10th of October, I believe, I took the letters out of the box to put into the bag for the post; it was my duty to do so; I put them into a bag to be sent to the post-office, at Bury St. Edmunds - that bag had a lock and key; there were two keys to it - I kept one, and the post-master at Bury St. Edmunds, kept the other - I locked the bag on those days and did so always - I gave the bag to a person kept on purpose to take it to the post-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you left Lord Bristol's service? A. About a month - why I left the service is a matter between his lordship and myself - I will swear it does not arise from the present affair - I knew nothing of the present affair until last week, and I dare say I could produce testimonials from his lordship; I am now in his lordship's service at another place - I have no other reason to remember this particularly, except that it was a duty conferred on me, and I know I performed it - I took the letters out of the box that day; I cannot say how many there were; it is quite useless to try to remember. I believe Lord Bristol is a Member of the House of Peers; his lordship's letters generally come directed to himself - the number of letters vary from five or six to fifteen or sixteen a day; it depended entirely on what company was in the house - I have no recollection how many there were on the 9th or 10th of October - I have sometimes examined the addresses, if a party has wished to know if a frank had been put into the box for them - I cannot swear whether I examined the letters on the evenings of the 9th or 10th of October; I sent the bag to the post-office by Ralph who assists in the stables and fetches and carries the letters; he generally takes them; he always brings me the box - I cannot say whether he took them or not; I have sent them by another person once; I only remember doing so once.</p>

            , 6, Grafton-street - the entry is my own writing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280103"></xptr>- it was a money-letter; it was taken out of Lord Bristol's letter bag, which came locked to the office; the key of the bag hung up in the office - I unlocked it myself and took the letter out; it was franked; after I entered it, it was laid aside in the box, until the time of making up the letters; and I entered it also on the letter-bill of that day; this is that letter-bill; it was on the 10th of October; here is an entry on the bill, of a money-letter, in the name of Newberry - I make the bill out from the book; they bear the same date; the bill goes up to the post-office, in London, with the letters, to let them know that letter should be there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Spell the manner in which you you have written the address? A." D. Newbry;" I always copy the address of money-letters, into this book; and the name, and street, with great correctness and care - I generally copy the Christian name when I copy it at length, and the surname I always copy at length - according to the best of my belief, the entry is a fair copy of the letter - it is Grafton-street, "Grafton" is spelt with one "f" and an "a" - I recollect the letter being franked - my attention was called to the entry, about a month after the 10th of October - I supposed that letter was franked, because it corresponded with the one stated to be lost - (I never could have written "bry" for "berry,") that is the only reason I suppose the letter to have been franked - we always lay the money letters in a small box, made for that purpose; the box was not locked; it was in the centre of the office - master has nine children and a wife in the house, who have access to it; it is a shop, but the office is parted off with a book-shop; there is an entrance from the book-shop into the office - the shop is much frequented - we should see a person passing from the shop to the office; there is no door, but there is an open place to the shop - the postmaster takes the letters out of the box; if he is unwell, his wife, Mrs. Deck, does it, and if she was unwell, I should take them - about four persons in general have access to the box - the post goes out at ten o'clock, the shop is closed at nine o'clock, and then the office duty is done, till the mail stops; the letter arrived on the 10th of October, and was sent to London the same night.</p>

            . I am postmaster, of Bury, St. Edmunds. On the evening of the 10th of October, I did not open the bag which came from Lord Bristol's; a letter bill is forwarded from the office every night, to town, with the letters (looking at a bill) - this signature, John Deck, is mine - I forwarded that bill on the 10th of October, with the letters, as it is now (reads) "10th of October, unpaid letters, for London, 3l. 17s. 6d. unpaid letters passing through London, 16s.; paid letters 1l. 4s.; money-letters, one name Ascroft, anothernamed Newberry"- here is at the bottom of the bill, a direction, that letters containing cash, should be entered, and wrapped up in the bill; and I wrapped up myself, that night, the two letters in the name of Ascroft and Newberry, and forwarded them that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you see this book? A. Every night; as the letters are sent off I enter in the book the amount of each bill, the amount of postage from each town, the memorandums are inserted previous to my inserting the amount of postage - on the 10th of October, when I wrote the amount of postage, the memorandums were there - the business of my post-office ought to be conducted with care, and I believe it is; I generally look at the memorandums, containing the name and addresses of the money-letters - I saw that the addresses of the money-letters corresponded with the book, and the letter bill, and I did so on the 10th of October; I discovered no mistake - my clerk opened Lord Bristol's bag - he generally opens it - I have no recollection of his doing so, on the 10th of October - if he is unwell I open it myself - and sometimes part of my family - my family have not assisted me in the business, for months - as regards the bag, I am confident they have not opened it; having examined the bill with the book, I despatch the bill with the moneyletters in it to London - the other money-letter is entered in the bill by the name of Uscott.</p>

Borrett, in the hand-writing of the prisoner - (looking at the bill) I received this bill, that morning; here are my initials to it as having received two money-letters - I have another entry, of one in the name of Ascroft, Great Leonard-street, next to it - I have not a doubt that entry was taken from this bill - I delivered the letter addressed to Newberry, to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you seen the prisoner write? A. Perhaps fifty or one hundred times; I have been in the Post-office for more than four years - I swear that is his signature; I have not the least doubt of it - we are as particular as we can be in making entries in the book; considering the time we have to do it in - we make mistakes sometimes - I have spelled the name "Newbury;" I copied it from the letter, not from the bill - I cannot swear that it was "bury" on the letter; it is "berry" on the bill apparently - I should not think of contracting to "bry" purposely - with the greatest care mistakes will happen; I do not call it a great mistake - we write as carefully as possible.</p>

            . My wife is in the service of Lord Jermyn, and was so in October. I live at No. 6, Grafton-court, Paradise-street, Manchester-square. I expected to receive a letter from my wife with money in it, and I never got it - I do not know when it was to come - I wrote to her, when she wrote to me to know why I did not answer this letter, which I had never received - I was sent for to the Post-office afterwards - I have never received a letter from her with a sovereign in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You live in Grafton-court, not street? A. No; there is no Grafton-street in the neighbourhood, that I know of - I have lived in the court two years, and do not know any Grafton-street - either North-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280104"></xptr>street or Paradise-street will do for my address - both streets lead to the court.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Grafton-court, North-street, Manchester-square. Dennis Newberry lodges with me; if the postman brought any letters to my house I always received them while Newberry has been with me - in October last, I received no money-letter for Newberry, nor any letter at all for him - I received no money-letter in October; I know the prisoner; he is the postman who I received letters from when they came - he never delivered me a money-letter in October - he brought a letter for Newberry - I cannot say whether it was in October - I gave Newberry the letter I received.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Grafton-street, in your neighbourhood? A. No; I never got but one letter from this woman since she has been at Bury - I never received a letter addressed to Grafton-street - nobody lodged in my room but Newberry - I do not know how many lodge in the house; there are several families lodge in the house - I only occupy one room, which is the parlour on the ground-floor - I do not know about the back room - the two rooms at the top are occupied - I received every letter for Mr. Newberry that ever came to the house, while he was with me - I am not much out of the house, because I have a little family - my husband sells things in the street; I do not go out with him - I have not been out a single day selling fruit within the last three months - I am not the owner of the house; I rent one room, that is all - I never received more than one letter for Mr. Newberry since his wife went into the country.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier. I recollect a short time ago seeing a receipt for a money-letter directed to Grafton-street, North, Manchester-square; I deliver in Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square; it therefore occurred to me that the letter did not belong to my division - I had it in my possession at my seat which is in the same division as the prisoner belongs to - I either gave the receipt to the prisoner, or put it before him; if it had been an unpaid letter I should have given it to the charge taker; but a paid letter or a frank, I should give to the prisoner or put it before him; that would be the course of my duty - when I read the direction, it struck me forcibly at the time it must be intended for Grafton-street, North-street, Manchester-square, and I shewed the receipt to the prisoner; I remember that, and I asked him if that would do for him; he said,"Yes" - I was aware that Grafton-court was in his delivery, I had been on that walk myself some years ago - I remarked to him that that laid wide from my Grafton-street - the prisoner's duty would be to take it into the inner office, and by shewing it to the clerk he would get me letter and sign a book for it; he would take the receipt with the letter to the party it was intended for, and get them to sign it, and he is expected to keep that receipt as his acknowledgement; I have some hundreds of these receipts by me - if a carrier was asked a question about the delivery of a money-letter, he would have the receipt to produce; I have had that to do myself; it has happened to me - the prisoner lives by Chadwells, Gray's-inn-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The letter you saw, and of which you have been speaking, was addressed to Grafton-street, North, Manchester-square? A. I saw no letter; that was the address on the receipt, "Grafton-street, North;" I am pretty sure it was not North-street - I deliver at two Grafton-streets; my delivery is not near Grafton-court; it is the nearest Grafton-street to Grafton-court - the Grafton-street in my delivery, is the nearest Grafton-street to his delivery; his delivery is not next to mine - there is Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square, and Upper Grafton-street; and Pannel, my assistant, delivers in Grafton-street, East.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had a letter directed to either of the Grafton-streets in your delivery, should you think of taking it to Grafton-court? A. No; nor should I have sent this, but seeing "North," and "Manchester-square," on it - I either put the receipt before the prisoner where he sat, or gave it into his hand - it is usual at times to put them into the delivery when the carriers are not there it is a frequent custom - I thought it was intended for Grafton-court from its having "North," and "Manchester-square" on it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When persons are absent from their seats, receipts may be left there for them? A. Yes; the prisoner was at his seat - I will not swear he saw me lay it down; but I said to him, "Will this do for you?" he said, "Yes, it will" - I had his walk once; there is no Grafton-street in that walk; Grafton-court is about half a mile perhaps from the Grafton-street in my walk.</p>

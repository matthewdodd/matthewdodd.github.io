               <p>Q. Have you any other servant? - A. Yes; a boy. I suspected her of setting fire to several parts of the house on the first of February; both the window-curtains were burnt, without the least communication with each other, up two pair of stairs, in the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you discover this? - A. About six o'clock; I had been out; I returned home about a quarter before five; I left in the house

            , a washerwoman, a boy, and the servant of the house that took Sophia Dale's place. There was a great deal of clean linen burnt, that lay on the foot of the bed ready to be put on; the bed-clothes were burnt through, but not the bed; the side-valence of the bed was burnt, which had no communication with the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to go up stairs? - A. I did not go up myself; I sent a servant who had taken Sophia's place; it was not burning then, it had the appearance then of being burnt; a gown which lay in the wardrobe was burnt, and the wardrobe door was locked with a key in it, and nothing else in that place was burnt; and a place burnt on the stairs, with some grease left, as though a candle had been placed there, opposite the bed-room door; all was safe when I came home; I had been out about three hours, and about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I had occasion to send up for something in the bed-room; my servant, who had taken Sophia's place, came down, and said the room was full of smoke; I ran up stairs, and as soon as I could recover the suffocation, I saw the clothes burnt, without the least appearance of flame or blaze.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fire in the room? - A. No; I had not had a fire in the room for a fortnight; I called for somebody to come up, the washer-woman came up, and caught the clothes burning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the window-curtains blazing? - A. No; some parts were red, and some parts were black.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not yourself know when the prisoner went out? - A. No, I do not; when I came home she was gone; I enquired when she went out; I was told she had been out about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you discharged her? - A. No; I meant to discharge her the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with her? - A. I had told her of running me in debt, at four or five places in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know she was to go away? - A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she come home again? - A. Not till the next day, about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she account for her absence? - A. She said that she called at a friend's house, and that she was informed of the accident, and was so alarmed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150007"></xptr>at a fire, she could not return sooner. I was almost convinced she had done it. I was advised by the attorney to stop her wages to pay the debts; it was upwards of 5 l. she had run me in debt; her wages were not so much.</p>

             sworn. - I went to Mrs. Mordecai's place on the 31st of January, between the hours of six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you find in the house? - A. I found a washerwoman in the kitchen below, a maid servant, and a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by maid servant? - A. The prisoner; the accident was on the first of February.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you go up on that day? - A. I went up about ten minutes past five, or thereabouts; there was no smell of fire then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go up again? - A. About half an hour after; then I found it very smokey, and was very much alarmed. I went down to my mistress, and asked her if the chimnies were given to smoking; she said no; and told me to go up again, and smelling fire, I screamed for assistance; the best of the clothes that had been put on the bed were like tinder, and the bed-clothes were all in a moulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they blazing? - A. No; quite of a smother; the farther cornice of the window was quite of a moulder, and the window-curtain like tinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at what time the prisoner went out on the day this happened? - A. About five in the evening; I could not keep her in the house; she refused to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you want to keep her in the house for? - A. I wanted her to stop to dinner; she said she wanted to go to a lady, to get her in the hospital; she said she was afraid of going down Piccadilly, for fear of meeting her mistress and another lady.</p>
               <p>Q. She was gone before her mistress came home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did her mistress come home? - A. She came home about half-past five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had been up stairs that afternoon? - A. I rather think she had. She had been taking the drawing-room curtains down, and she said all was shut up stairs, and in the bed-room all was shut; she did not want the boy to go up. She did not like to go out till it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she did not like to go out till it was dark? - A. No; but she did not want any of us to know when she went out.</p>
               <p>Court. That is only your idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was in the kitchen, had she her bonnet on? - A. Yes; she said could not stay, she desired me to cut her dinner off, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was your dinner hour - A. Half-past five o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go out that evening? - A. I saw her leave the kitchen to go out, about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the first alarm? - A. About a quarter before six, the maid had been sent up stairs to fetch a jacket; some time after she went up stairs to fetch something else for her mistress; I heard a noise that there was a fire; I went up to see what was amiss, and found the things burning; all of a mouldering, like tinder when struck a light; all the things that were on the foot of the bed. I put the burnt things which were on the bed in my apron, and saw the window-curtains were all consumed, and the front frame of the window was burnt.</p>

On the stair of the garret, above this room, there was a burnt place, about three inches in length; it appeared as if it had been done with a candle, was black, and some grease left; and this trinket-box (shews the box) on the toilet-table was burnt, and the cloth on the toilet-table was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Mordecai.) Where was that box? - A.It stood on the side of the looking-glass.</p>

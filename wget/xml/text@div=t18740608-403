                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Atwell Yard, Uxbridge—on the afternoon of 5th May I went out into my back yard, I saw two militia men in' the next yard—the prisoner was one of them—they were firing up in the air—I said you are enough to frighten anyone to death; you know you could get reported for this—they said nothing—the prisoner did something to his gun which I did not take notice of, I stooped down to wring out some clothes, and he pointed his gun through some palings and fired at me—they were lath palings, I could not see over them—I could see through them; they were a distance apart—he put his rifle through; I could see about half of it—I was hit in the side of the neck and ace—I bled very much—it did not knock me down—I did not know where I was for some minutes—I went in doors and sent for a doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was two or three minutes after I said they might be reported that I was shot—I was standing close to my door when I first spoke to them, I then walked a few steps further on, and then stooped down—here are no flowers or creepers up the palings—the other man went in doors when he had fired off his rifle; he fired his off up in the air—they had been out to drill just before—they had been billeted there about two months—I only knew the prisoner by his speaking to me, and my not answering him—they had fired off their rifle once before—there was no shot—there are fields at the back.</p>

I am manager at the Norfolk Arms—I was present when the prisoner came in—Hitchcock gave the half-crown to me—I marked it, gave it back to him, and told the prisoner it was bad—I asked him where he got it; he said, at his stall the night before, when he was drunk—I saw Hitchcock give it back to Ford—he left, and I followed him about sixty or seventy yards—he went up Church-street and joined Palmer—he was on the same Bide of the road as she was, but she crossed, and he crossed to her, and they went on together to the Cleveland-road—he left her standing while he went over into the Mitre—he was only a minute or so there—he came out and she crossed the road to him—they then walked together towards the Downham-road—a constable who was with me all the time, apprehended them—Ford was then slightly in advance of Palmer—he passed Palmer, touched Ford on the shoulder, and then seized Palmer, and handed Ford over to a gentleman who is not here—Palmer held her left hand very tight, but the constable succeeded at last in getting it open, and I saw a paper drop into the constable's hand—he said, "You see how many pieces"—I said, "How many?"—he said, "Four"—I saw four half-crowns in the paper—one was of 1819, but the others were different.</p>

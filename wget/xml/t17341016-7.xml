I left my Goods locked in my Trunk in the Room where I lay, and went out of Town on the 1st of August. I staid till the 29th of September, and when I returned my Trunk had been broke open, and my Goods were taken away. The Lock had been taken off, and put on again with new Nails. I got a Search-Warrant, and went to Mr. Johnson (a Pawn-broker's) where I found 1 of my Shams, and 2 Rollers, and at Mr. Stone's (another Pawn broker's) I found 2 more of my Shams and a Stock.</p>

            . I lived then in Devereux Court. The Prosecutor left his Trunk locked fast; and as for the Door of the Room being open, perhaps when a Friend has staid late at my House, I have got him to go up and lie with the Prisoner. I can't say but I had a very good Character of the Prisoner, or else I should not have taken him for a Lodger. On my leaving my House I removed the Trunk into another Room; I thought it was very light; but my Head was so full of my own Affairs, that I did not then enquire into the Reason of it.</p>
               <p>Three or four Witnesses appeared to the Prisoner's Character. They deposed, that they known him several Years, that he was a <rs id="t17341016-7-deflabel36" type="occupation">Taylor</rs>

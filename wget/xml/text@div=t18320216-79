The prisoner lodged for three weeks with us - I desired her to leave me, and as she was going I asked to see her things; she refused - I insisted upon it; she then opened a bundle, and I saw a pair of shoes which I knew - she would not let me see any more, but went away; I told the Policeman - he brought her back, and took her key from her: these articles, which are mine, were found in her box and in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is not she an old acquaintance of your's? A. I knew her when she was about twenty years of age, but I had lost sight of her from that time; she looked out the house for me in which we now live, but I took it - she did not assist me to remove; the same cart took her things and mine, but they were separately packed up - she did not keep her articles in my drawer or boxes; she paid me 1s. a week for one room - I told her that the shoes were mine, but she took them away, and came back for more things; my own articles are not marked, but here is one stocking marked, which is my nephew's, and this handkerchief is my sister's; all her furniture, and bed and bedding, are still at my house.</p>

On the 7th of May, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was in the Strand, going towards Charing-cross. My watch chain hung out, the prisoner ran violently against me, with his elbows against my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220011"></xptr>breast, and pulled at my chain which broke it, and ran off with it; I lost part of the chain and two gold seals. I hit him with my umbrella; he ran down Milford-lane - I pursued and knocked him down, and secured him without losing sight of him. I asked him for my watch-chain and seals, he said he had not got them. I do not know what became of them, I do not think he could pass them to any one; I suppose he might have dropped them; I saw them in his possession. He pulled me a step or two before the chain gave way. I cannot say whether he had complete possession of them after he separated them. After taking him to the watch-house, I returned to the lane, and the people were looking with a candle for them; he could have thrown them away without my seeing them. I am sure he ran against me on purpose.</p>

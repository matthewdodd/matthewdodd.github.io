I was on duty on 6th Nov., at half past 2 o'clock in the morning, and saw the prosecutor's shop had been broken open—I called Mr. White up—I heard some one moving in a mews directly opposite; I ran across, and met Payne coming out, with something bulky under his arm—I asked him what he had got; he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Allow me to see"—I opened his coat, and took this clock from under his right arm—I took him across to Mr. White, who by that time had come down, and he identified the clock as his property—Payne was very violent;</p>

               <p>he struck me in the mouth, and got away from me—I caught him again, about 100 yards off—he struck me again in the mouth, and out my lip.</p>

I was on duty n Rathbone Place, on 6th Nov.—about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock that morning I saw Harris and Payne together, in company with a female—they were about 100 yards from Mr. White's shop, and were standing talking—I went on my beat, and left them there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Payne's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). At the time the depositions were taken I was not in a state to defend or protect myself, in consequence of the shameful treatment of the policeman who took me into custody; on the evening of 5th Nov., I went to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, to meet some friends; I remained till the following morning; and on my way home, through Charles Street, Soho Square, I saw three or four persons run out of Rathbone Place and turn up Oxford Street; I crossed over Oxford Street, and a little way up Rathbone Place I turned up an archway for a necessary purpose; and on coming out I saw, standing on a door-step, a time piece; I took it up and looked at it; I thought somebody had set it down and forgotten it; I expected a reward would be offered for it; I put</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185712140008"></xptr>
               <p>it under my arm, and turned up Rathbone Place; the policeman came across, and asked what I had; I immediately told him, "A time piece;" and I handed it to him; he asked where I got it, and I told him what I now state; he then told me that there had been a clock shop broken into just by, and that I must go with him to the shop; I answered, "Certainly I will;" he then called the shopkeeper up, and told him that two windows had been broken; he asked him if he had lost anything; the shopkeeper answered he had lost some clocks, and he thought the one I had was his; the policeman then said I must accompany him to the police station; I refused doing so, not knowing anything of the robbery; I turned, and said I was going home; he stopped me, and we went back to the shop till he was ready to go, and then a scuffle took place between us because I refused to go; but upon another constable coming up I consented to go quietly; on our way to the station, as we were walking quietly, the constable 136 said, "What did you strike me in the mouth for?" I said I did not strike him, or if I did, it was by accident; he said, "Take that, you b—," striking me in the face right and left till I fell; he then kicked me in the side and the hip, and said, "Get up, you b—;" I said, "What are you doing this for, and what have I done? directly I got up he struck me with his fist and his staff; I fell again, screaming "Murder!" as well as I could, or I believe he would have killed me; when I arrived at the police station, I asked to see the doctor, who came and said my jaw was broken, and I must be taken to the hospital, and there the house surgeon examined me, and said both my jaws were broken, and all my teeth were knocked out, which are now fastened in with wires; both my eyes were seriously injured, and the doctor thought I should lose the sight of one, and I was not expected to live; I was confined to bed for two weeks, therefore I was unable to prepare my defence before the Magistrate; the doctor told me that my face would never be right, and that I never should be the man I had been; there were no blows struck before we got to Oxford Street; a policeman swears he saw me and another man, and a woman, standing in Rathbone Place, within a short distance of where the robbery was committed; how is it possible for anybody to swear to me in the state in which my face was when even my own friends did not know me; they took another man about my size and height, and kept him a fortnight, and discharged him; and if they were sure I was the man, why did they take him; in respect to my character, I have twelve months good character, as a butler, at No. 12, Great Cumberland Place, Hyde Park; my late master says, if I had been inclined to be a rogue, I could have done so while in his service; I had a deal of valuable property under my care; I am every morning in the habit of going to gentlemen's houses, where I could rob if I were so inclined; I know nothing of the man who is charged with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a watch, chain, and seal, when you went into this cook's shop - A. I had. The prisoner went by the name of Bateman then; he goes by the name of Wilson now. I had the watch in my hand as I was going out of the back door; the prisoner took hold of my hand, and said let me keep your watch, you may lose it going along; I let him have it, I did not suppose he would run away with it; then I went into the back yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man been in your company - A. Yes, for two or three days; we were to sail together from this country; I was in the back yard four or five minutes; a man called to me and said the prisoner is gone away with your watch; we searched for the prisoner and could not find him. I have since seen the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the watch to do as he pleased with it - A. No, I let him have it to take care of it.</p>

            . I keep the Ship and Shears, Lower Shadwell. On the 5th of January, about half past ten o'clock, the prisoner came into my house, apparently very much in liquor; he asked me if he could sleep there as usual; I told him he could have the same bed he had before, he then took out a watch from his pocket, begging me to take care of it for him; he left it in my care till the officer had it, he said he gave five guineas for it; he then told me he had no money, to keep the watch until he got a ship, the captain would pay me; the sum was two pounds five shillings that I had let him run up.</p>

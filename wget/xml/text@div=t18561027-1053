                  </hi>. I am inspector of nuisances to the Greenwich Board of Works. On a Saturday in Aug. I went to Mr. Preece's, who keeps the Plume of Feathers, accompanied by a police officer—I found in his yard some missing stones—I told him the men had stolen that stone which was lying in his yard, as well as their master's mortar, and I had brought the the police officer to see that it was on his premises—he said, "There is a bit or two, I believe; there is a bit there, and there is a bit there, and there"—I said, "There are twelve pieces, and here are three stones over what were wanted to pave the yard"—I asked him what he had given for the mortar and stones—he said that he first went to the men, Adams and Butler, who were working outside, and told them a stone was broken in the yard and could they repair it, and they told him, "Yes"—I said, "But that don't'account for ten or a dozen stones"—he made no answer to that—the officer said, "We must take you into custody for having these stones and mortar"—and he mid, "Well, I will pay you any amount of money you may desire"—I asked him what he paid for them—he said he had given the men some beer—I asked him how much—and he did not seem to know—I considered that he meant as much as they liked.</p>

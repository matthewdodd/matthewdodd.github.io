The Prosecutor swore, That being much in Drink, and coming by Stocks-Market late at Night, Tayler ask'd him for a Dram, which he gave her, and was perswaded by her to go into a Coach, which drove to her Lodging; where when they came, she got half a Pint of Brandy, and he drank it off, and then she put him to Bed; and about Ten the next Morning he wak'd, and found himself robb'd of all his Money and Moveables; whereupon he made what Enquiry he could of the Passages that had been over Night, and upon Search found Tayler and some of the Goods upon her, but had nothing material to alledge against Richardson. Tayler in her Defence said, she did meet the Prosecutor, and he pick'd her up, and call'd a Coach, and she did go along with him, but did not rob him of any thing. The Jury upon considering the whole Matter, were pleas'd to <rs id="t17140908-31-verdict170" type="verdictDescription">

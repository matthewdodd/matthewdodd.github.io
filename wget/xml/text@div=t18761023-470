               <p>and charged with attempting to rescue—she got hold of me by the back of the collar and nearly choked me; that was when Marsh was in custody, when we were on the ground—there was a mob of somewhere about seventy or eighty people—they were very disorderly, pushing one against the other and throwing stones and brick bats—they were thrown at all of us; one hit Henry Marsh, one hit Kersey, and one struck me in the back—I did not see the prisoner there; she did not speak to me and say "Don't hurt him, he is not very well; go to the station, Henry, and I will bring your father to bail you out"—I did not then take my hands from Henry Marsh and strike her on the side of her face, nor did she fall in consequence—I never saw her there at all—I did not see any woman on her baok; I did not strike any woman—I and Kersey took Henry Marsh to the station, and Goldsworthy followed behind—Atwell went part of the way, not all the way—I was present when he was charged—Goldsworthy took the woman Forrester, she followed up part of the way—after they were charged the prisoner came in—the prisoners were put in the dock; Sergeant Borner was the acting inspector—the prisoner came right into the room; she said "Have you got my son here?"—the sergeant said "Yes, there he is," point<lb></lb>ing to the dock—she said "What is he charged with?"—he said "With being drunk and disorderly and assaulting two constables in the execution of their duty"—she said "Will bail be taken?"—the sergeant said "Yes, I will take Mr. Marsh's bail"—she said "Mr. Marsh is at home ill in bed and can't come"—the sergeant said "I will take any respectable man that pays rates and taxes;" and she thanked the sergeant and went away—she made no complaint against me at that time—she did not say to me "There you are, what provocation did I <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you to knock me down in the road?" Ser<lb></lb>geant Borner did not get up from his seat and say to her "Turn out"—she did not say "I am not a dog; this is working hard and paying rates and taxes to look forward to police officers to protect you, and treat you like dogs"—no complaint was made against any of the constables—I have been close upon six years in the force—I believe they were bailed out next morning—on Monday, the 24th, Henry Marsh and Kate Forrester appeared at the police-court, and I and Kersey gave evidence—the Magistrate con<lb></lb>victed them both and they were sentenced—I was not present when Henry Marsh's father made a statement to the Magistrate; I went away thinking the case had been finally disposed of—no witnesses were called for the defence on the 24th; the matter was brought on again on the 31st—witnesses were then called, and the prisoner amongst others—the prisoners were convicted after the second hearing—the prisoner was not there on the 24th—I afterwards received a summons charging me with an assault—I appeared on the 7th August and it was adjourned to the 8th and I was acquitted by the Magistrate.</p>

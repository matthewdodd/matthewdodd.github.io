Last Friday evening I left my mare in a field opposite my house - the fences were entire, and the gate to, but not locked; there is a footpath through the field. I saw her safe there between eight and nine at night. I kept my poultry in the piggery, adjoining the stable, in the field - it is boarded round; I had not seen the fowls later than noon. The watchman called me up about half-past five o'clock, and informed me he thought my property was at Stamford-hill. I ran up to the turnpike, which is about a mile from my house, and the turnpike man shewed me my fowls in a sack. I knew them to be mine - they were then dead; one had its head pulled off, the others were wrenched. My mare was also at the gate, with my bridle on, also a horse-cloth, and a whip, which was in the stable when I saw it last. I know the mare to be mine. The stable-door was not locked.</p>

            . I was on duty at Stamford-hill. I am collector of the weighing tolls. On the 15th of January, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the gate with a horse, wanted to go through, and said he had only a penny - the toll is 3 d. I refused to let him through; he pretended to call after a man, as his master, but nobody answered. I saw a sack across the horse's back, felt something warm in it, and pulled it out - they were five fowls, just killed. I then collared him, and my companion went for a watchman, who took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say - A. He said his master had gone on, that the mare belonged to Mr. Russell, and that the person who had employed him, and had gone on, told him if they would not let him through, to say Mr. Russell, of Edmonton, would pay in the course of the day. Alddridge came up soon after, he saw the fowls and the mare, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not speak to a man - A. I did not hear him, nor see him go up to any one. He was going towards town.</p>

            . I am a watchman just by Stamford-hill gate, on the Tottenham side. I saw the prisoner and another man go by together; the other was twenty or thirty yards before the prisoner. I did not hear them speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they were companions or not you could not tell - A. No. The prisoner was leading the horse by the bridle - a sack was across the horse. I said,</p>
               <p>"Good morning," but I do not think he answered me. The other man said,</p>
               <p>"Good morning," and the prisoner began coughing - I had no suspicion then. A few minutes after Guest called me up, and gave charge of him; I saw nothing of the other man then. There were five fowls in the sack.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work, and was obliged to walk about, having no place to sleep at. About four o'clock I met a man at Tottenham-cross, he asked if I was out of work, and said if I would lead the horse to the White Hart, at Shoreditch, he would give me 1 s.; he gave me a penny to pay the turnpike, and told me to say, if any one asked about the horse, that it belonged to Mr. Russell, of Edmonton.</p>

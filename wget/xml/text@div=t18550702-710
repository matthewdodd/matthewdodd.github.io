                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, of No. 11, Sidney-place, Poplar. On Monday afternoon, June 25th, my sister, Eliza Ann Hard, went with a friend to Dale's-court, Poplar, and I was just behind them—when they entered Dale's-court my sister was attacked—I heard her scream, ran to help her, and saw Driscoll with a fire shovel in her hand—I pulled my sister away from Driscoll; the fire shovel was taken away by somebody behind her—a chopper was then brought to Driscoll, I do not know who by, and she chopped me on the upper part of my arm, and cut me; and afterwards a butcher's knife was handed to her by somebody, and she cut me with it on the elbow—it bled—my sister went to see a friend in the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Sidney-street. I went with Mrs. Woodbridge to see a friend in Dale's-court; my brother was behind having a pint of beer—as we entered the court the prisoners <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> pantiles and earthenware at us, and Mrs. Davidson gave Driscoll a fire pan to beat me with—they fell <hi rend="italic">aboard</hi> of me, and began to scratch me—I <hi rend="italic">squeaked</hi> out, and my brother came to take my part; Mrs. Driscoll threw the fire shovel, and hit him across the head with it; the shovel was taken from her by Mr. Woodbridge, who was with my brother—Mrs. Davidson then brought a chopper out of her home, and gave it to Mrs. Driscoll—she went to strike me over the head with it; Mr. Woodbridge <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me back to save my life, and it fell on my brother's arm—she was not striking at my brother, but at me—Mrs. Davidson said, "Give me the chopper, it will not do any good," and handed a knife to Mrs. Driscoll, who took it, and stabbed it into my brother's arm.</p>

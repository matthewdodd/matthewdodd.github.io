            . I am a constable. On the 13th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in St. Martin's-lane, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's shop; I saw the prisoner cross over with this flannel on his shoulder; I asked him where he got it - he said from Fleet-street, but he was going toward Fleet-street, and I took him to the office. I found on the Following evening that Mr. Blake had lost it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman came up to me in Fleet-street, and gave it me to carry; and when I was stopped I found he had absconded.</p>

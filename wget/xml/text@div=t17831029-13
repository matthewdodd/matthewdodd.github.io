             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Heaton, he was in his phaeton and I with him, we were coming from Moor-park on the 21st of August last, and we stopped at the Duke of Chandois's Arms, at Edgware, and my master asked for a man and horse with arms to guide his phaeton to town, but they said they had none at home, it was then turned of eight, and the prisoner then came by on a grey horse, went slowly through the town, and looked very hard at the chaise, with that I said to my master, Sir, there is a gentleman going to town on horseback, and very likely he will accompany you; we overtook him in the town going for London, and I says good night to you; he walked and trotted; I always ride in the phaeton with my master.</p>
               <p>How was the night? - There was daylight enough, I said good night to you; with that he turned his head aside; I then went on, and there is a bridge turning out of the town near to the turnpike, and the prisoner came up then close to the phaeton and looked at us, he rode between the turnpike and the phaeton, I thought the fore wheel of the phaeton must have taken hold of his horse, he got a little before us then, and he slackened his pace, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290052"></xptr> came up to him; I still looked at him very hard, then we got a little ahead again with the phaeton, he did not stop, but rather slackened his pace, with that we got ahead of him about an hundred yards, and my master turned his head round, and saw him come up very smart towards the phaeton again, I turned round after my master mentioned it, and saw him close on the phaeton, and my master said directly, depend upon it that is a highwayman, I said I could not think it, but that he was a Londoner out, holiday making, I did not know but he might have been a clerk or something of that kind; he came up close to the phaeton, and I turned round, and I said directly to him, says I, what are you, are you afraid to come up? with that he slackened his pace again, and staid behind: We pushed on, and twice afterwards he came up in the same manner; I looked very hard at him every time, it was quite light. The fifth attack was the general attack; he then came up with a little bit of black something, it was not crape, but it appeared to me as if he had cut the inside of his hat to bring over his eyes, I then looked back and saw him, he was about two hundred yards behind, I could see him very plain waving his pistol, and hallooing out stop, stop, stop, very loud; he came up to my side, which was the off side, and presented his pistol, and said stop, (I had said to my master before he came up, whatever you have give it him for fear of an accident) I said my friend take your pistol away, and you shall have what we have got; my master gave him his watch, he did not demand it, but he gave it him; he put it in his pocket and said then your money, with that my master gave him his purse with eight guineas and an half, and about twelve shillings in silver; we baited at Rickmansworth, and my master had ten guineas in his pocket when he came out in the morning: After the prisoner had robbed my master, he says to me, Sir, your money, I said I am but a servant, what I have got is but very trifling, he said necessity obliged him, and he waved his pistol, I begged he would take it away, I then stood up in the phaeton to put my hand in my breeches pocket to give him what I had, being quite intimidated with the pistol, I gave him about six or seven shillings in silver, and half a guinea; after that I said, still looking at him, as the little thing he had over his face came only to his lip, and I said, Sir, you gentlemen of the road have a bye-word, whatever it is I will be obliged to you to give us the watch-word, he made no reply, but clapped spurs to his horse and and rode off; we turned off to Edgware, and lay there that night, we were about a mile from Edgware at this time, the next morning coming to town, we gave information before Sir Sampson Wright, some time after Sharman was apprehended, and Sir Sampson sent down to us, I went to see if he was the man, but he was quite different from the man that robbed me, and I told Sir Sampson he was not the man; some time afterwards Sir Sampson sent again, and the prisoner was brought up, and the instant I saw him I knew him to be the person; whilst Sir Sampson was examining him, he wished some bitter wishes that he never knew the Edgware road, nor the way to it; he was further examined when the turnpike-man was present.</p>
               <p>Court. You are very sure this is the man? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Pray Mr. Coachman are you sure as to the hour of the night? - Within five minutes under or over.</p>
               <p>What kind of pace might you be coming home? - I suppose about six or seven miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Was there any particular inducement that led you to take more notice of this man than any other common traveller on the road? - By my master's saying he was a highway-man.</p>
               <p>Your master never made that observation till you came through the turnpike? - He did not.</p>
               <p>When you spoke to him, I think you say he made no answer but turned his head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290053"></xptr>Then you could not see his face at that time? - If you will take it the plain way, Sir, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>There was no particular inducement that led you to take notice of this man's person till that time? - You are going behind the story, Sir, I saw him again.</p>
               <p>You have given us an account of his overtaking you, and your overtaking him four times, as it happens very frequently to passengers on the road, you went one pace and he another, and so you alternately overtook each other? - We only overtook him at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>But you had no inducement to observe him before your master said he was a highwayman? - Only the oddness of his not returning the compliment when I wished him a good night, but he never was out of my view till the last attempt.</p>
               <p>Did you take as much notice of his horse as of him? - Equally the same.</p>
               <p>When this man was examined, was he put into a group of figures, or was he put to you singly to look at? - No, there were two of them.</p>
               <p>You did not swear to him positively then? - There was some lenity in me.</p>
               <p>Did not you take some minutes before you swore to him, and desire to call in the turnpike-man? - He wished such bitter wishes, that I desired to have my testimony established by the turnpike-man.</p>
               <p>What horse was he upon? - A grey horse.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am a turnpike-man, I was on the 21st of August at Edgware-bar, in the evening about a quarter after nine, I recollect the prisoner coming through on a grey horse, he was dressed in dark grey, with his hat flapped round, I went out to him and asked him if he had paid the toll, and he mentioned the letter, and by his turning his head round I had a full view of him; I did not hear of any robbery that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure by that transient view you had, the prisoner was the man? - Yes, it seemed to be a square hat, and the flap hung down; the next day the prosecutor and the man came up and asked me if I was in employ the overnight, if I recollected such a man, and what he was dressed in, I said in such coloured clothes as I have now, and the gentleman made reply, that is the man that robbed me of my watch and money.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the person? - To the best of my recollection, by the light of the lamp, that is the man, he was dressed in dark grey such as I have on now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What time was it you came on duty that night? - At seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>What might the time of night have been when this grey horse came through that you are speaking of? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>It was quite dark then? - There was the lamp on the post.</p>
               <p>That is on the other side? - No.</p>
               <p>How many horses had gone through before? - I had not opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Should you know the horse again? - I cannot say I should, one grey horse may be like another, I have no doubt no further than that I am sure so far to the best of my recollection; the next morning I described the marks of the man and the clothes that he wore.</p>
               <p>There was no inducement that led you to look at the man when he came through the gate? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>The man's hat was flapped? - Yes, the broad part of his hat, being a cocked hat, hung over his shoulders.</p>
               <p>And what sight you had was from the reflection of this lamp? - Yes, the lamp stands over the Horse-gate, I have seen the man in company with two or three others several times on that road, I did not think he was a rogue.</p>
               <p>Court to Flinn. What colour was his coat? - A grey coat.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of September, about nine at night, the master of the Bull and Gate Holborn, came down to the office, and said there was a man in his house that had lived with him as a waiter, and he had heard that he had carried pistols in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290054"></xptr> pocket, and he believed him to be a highwayman; I went up with him, and at the gate, there was a hackney coachman who enquired after the prisoner, if he was gone, as he had waited so long, I asked him where he brought him from, he said from Tower-stairs, and that he brought one man and a woman with him, and that the man who got out of the coach said to the prisoner, go to Prosser's at the New-inn, Tottenham-court-road, and discharge the horses: then I went into the room to him and searched him, I found nothing upon him but a guinea and a half, no pistols nor nothing about him; I secured him that night at the round-house, I went that night to Prosser's, and brought the ostler down, who said he had had horses there on Tuesday and Wednesday, he and another man, and that other man's name was Frasier, and we went out and took Frasier up from his direction, I brought the prisoner to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the turnpike-man one question; when you was at Bow-street office did not you say that I had a round hat, such as I have in my hand? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you deny it? - I said it was a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing further.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Flinn. Did you never trace the grey horse up to Mr. Prosser's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Morant. Prosser's were both brown horses that they had, it was not at that time.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any witnesses? - None.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, Mr. Heaton does not appear here himself, therefore it depends entirely upon the evidence given by his coachman, who swears in the very circumstantial manner you have heard, and who had repeated opportunities of seeing the person.</p>

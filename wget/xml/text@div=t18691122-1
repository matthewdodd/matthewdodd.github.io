               <p>is worth nothing like that—Mr. Cook was aware that my husband's family were not very fond of me—I don't believe that the property is not worth a so much, I believe the contrary—my brother-in-law never enlightens me upon anything as to what the property is worth, merely sends me a few accounts—I have not taken any means to ascertain what the property is worth, only what Mr. Cook has taken himself—he took out administration for me—he charged me for it—I have not taken any means since I have been out of the hands of Mr. Cook to take out administration, because Mr. Cook had had my administration previously—I have never seen them—I have not directed anybody to apply to Mr. Cook for them—I have never tried to take out administration in Ireland, because I thought Mr. Cook had already done so—he told me he had, or otherwise the pro<lb></lb>perty would not be secured to him—I don't know thai there is a farthing coming to me out of the Irish property—if I did take out administration, I don't know whether there is or no—my friends have not enlightened me upon the subject—I really don't know whether I shall get a penny out of it—I know how much money my husband actually had from Mr. Cook—he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides, the rest was for bonuses—the property is at Limerick—I took the policy to Mr. Cook because he was always very polite to me, and I took it to him to show it to him, and ask how I was to obtain it—I did not know of everything that had passed between my husband and Mr. Cook—my husband was often at Mr. Cook's without me—I knew that the policy was mentioned in the deed, but Mr. Cook said, "That is nothing, it is yours"—I was in such deep affliction, my husband dying, and three months afterwards I lost my little boy, and I had no money to pay the funeral expenses—that was what I wanted money for, and I thought to get my insurance money for it—I thought I was to obtain that and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was to advance—I firmly believed it.</p>

I was to receive from Mr. Cook—I was under the impression that he would deduct the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the insurance money, and hand me the difference—he led me to believe that I had something to do with the Irish property—I thought at the time that he would deduct it from the insurance money—my hus<lb></lb>band had agreed to the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a bonus—I never had any agreement—I did not understand I was to give back 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew that he had taken out administration for the property that was in England—he told me he had</p>

               <p>paid for it—I have not—I don't know whether it amounted to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he never gave me any account of the expenses—I did not know that there was also a succession duty to be paid—he never explained anything of the matter to me—my husband's brother is John Henry Hall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not learnt that this property in reality will not pay its in<lb></lb>cumbrances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Cook has, I have not learnt it; but Mr. Cook was in Ireland at the time he made ray husband an advance, and certainly when he was in Dublin, within a few miles, he went to see what the property was worth, no doubt—the annuity that has been mentioned was upon the life of my husband's mother—I don't know her age; I dare say she is past sixty—I don't know whether she is in bad health—I don't hear from her—I received from my brother an account of the value of the property for Mr. Cook, which I took him, and he has it; but, allow me to explain, there are lime<lb></lb>kilns, and at the time the account was rendered to Mr. Cook they were not at work, which brings in much more—I took the account to Mr. Cook, and left with him; I think it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the taxes were deducted—I think that was the annual produce of it; I really can't say—that was a paper I had obtained with a view of explaining the value of the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of Mrs. Hall—in September last year I went with her to Mr. Cook's office we saw Mr. Cook there—no one else was in the room when we first went in—Mr. Cook asked my sister if she required any money, she said "Yes"—he asked her if 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do—I replied directly, "No; we could not defray the expenses under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the Clerk Charles Poynter, was then called up, and Mr. Cook told him to read the deed—he read about three leaves, and Mr. Cook said he read it so hurriedly that he would read it himself—he took it out of his hands and read it so hurriedly that we could not understand it—the clerk read it the more intelligibly—after it was read, Mr. Cook said that there was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advance her, exclusive of her insurance money, and that the durance money was hers—he said he would advance her 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enable her to go into business—I did not understand, during the reading of the deed, that it conveyed the policy of insurance to Mr. Cook—we were in such trouble about the demise of my poor brother-in-law and the little child, that we did not know what we were doing scarcely—he said, "I merely mention the policy in the deed, but it is yours—we thought the Irish property would defray the expenses—I did not say so—Mr. Cook said that, of course, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be tacked on to the Irish mortgage.—</p>

               <p>my sister signed another document at the same time—I witnessed the deed—I called on Mr. Cook on the 19th November with reference to my sister—she was with me—Mr. Cook gave her a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told her she was not worth a shilling; he was very sorry for her—she cried so bitterly Mr. Cook came to the door and let us out, but he said "Now you are not worth a shilling"—I believe my sister signed some paper upon getting the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she requested a copy of it, which Mr. Cook was very much annoyed <hi rend="italic">at</hi>—I heard him say she was not worth a shilling—I did not hear him say that the money was all swallowed up in expenses—I was only there on two Occasions, on the 10th September and 19th November.</p>

I keep the White Lion, at Putney—I am brother of he prosecutrix—in June, 1868, I called on Mr. Cook, with my sister—she merely went to see him—I don't recollect what pissed—in January of this year, I wrote a letter to Mr. Cook, in consequence of a communication my sister made to me with regard to her policy—I directed the letter to "Mr. Cook, Warwick Street"—this is a copy of it—it is in my handwriting—I posted it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "6, Assembly Road, Clapham Junction. Sir, I was sur<lb></lb>prised; to hear from my sister, Mrs. Hall that you make a claim upon her Insurance money, and likewise refuse to lend her any more money than the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already received by her. As you must be aware this is all she had to Hoped upon, I therefore hope you will not plunge her and her family into want and misery, by keeping it from her. I must tell you, she is in deep Histress through the disappointment, and I do wish to know if you persist In detaining what I consider she is justly entitled to. Hoping you will favour me with an early reply, I am, Sir, Yours, John Smalley")—I received no reply to that letter, and I wrote a second letter, of which this is a copy—I posted this also (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Cook. Sir, I shall be very much obliged if you will kindly let me know what claim you have upon my sister's insurance, as I am very desirous of coming to some terms with you, if possible, on her behalf. I have been waiting for a reply to my previous letter, and shall feel obliged by your kind attention to this. Signed John Smalley")—I did not receive any reply to that letter—I went to see In. Cook, about a fortnight after, with my sister—he detained us some time in his office, before we could see him; but eventually we were told to go Into his own office, where he was—I walked in as I might into any gentle<lb></lb>man's room, and said I had just come to ask him why he had not replied to my two letters—he said, "For a very simple reason, because there is no reply required"—he did not deny the receipt of the letters—I said, "Will you tell me why you are detaining her insurance money"—he said, "For a very good reason, she owes me money; if not, her husband does"—I said, 'Well, but her husband's debts have nothing to do with hers"—and he immediately replied, that he had kept it for expenses—I said, "Surely, she as only had 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the rest can't be swallowed up in expenses"—he said it was so—I said, "What about that deed?"—he said, "Your sister has signed a deed for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Well, but what is it for, she has not got it; surely</p>

               <p>you don't intend to keep what is really her due from the insurance money"—he said he did, for expenses—I asked him if I could have a copy of the deed—he said, "Certainly, if you choose to pay for it"—I said I would do so—and he said, "Well, you must go to my solicitor"—I asked him who his solicitor was, and he immediately turned the conversation—he would not tell me who his solicitor was—I asked him again, but he made no reply—he then accused me of entering his room abruptly, and of speaking in a very abrupt manner—I said I was in the habit of going into gentlemen's rooms, and had never been accused of it before in my life; that I knew how to enter a room as well as he did—I said to my sister, "Never mind, you had better come away, and he shall hear further about it"—I was present at Hertford, when this action was tried—I saw a man named Poynter there—I was pre<lb></lb>sent during the trial—he was not called as a witness at all.</p>

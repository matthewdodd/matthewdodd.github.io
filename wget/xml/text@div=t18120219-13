               <p>Q. Did you go in consequence of the direction that is upon the back of that card. - A. I waited upon the prisoner at ten o'clock the next morning, I took a general assortment of what my wife was in the habit of working and selling. I selected the articles on the morning I went, I put them into a paper box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many articles you took. - A. I suppose from the quantity in the box, there must be about an hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived at the house were you shewn into it. - A. Yes, into a parlour on the right hand side, without a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to the door. - A. Mrs. Nissen. I began to open the box, she said she was very glad I had come in time, I shewed the articles, and she began admiring them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who had recommended you to her. - A. Not at that time; she selected what she thought was beautiful, she wished to take them to her mother, she informed me, and her sister; I opened more articles to her in the box, and she wished to shew them to her mother, she took a second quantity to shew her mother, she staid about the same time as she did the first, and returned; on her returning the second time, instead of coming to shew me the articles, to check, as she did the first, she came hasitly into the room, not coming to me to check the articles as she did the first time, but gathered all the articles with both her hands, that were laying on the table, or nearly the whole of the articles with both her hands, saying, Sir, we'll go into a room where there is a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go immediately with her. - A. I remained to pack up what was on the table that I wished to put into the box again, she did not gather all. On my going into the room where she was, she seemed very much confused, and was shutting the drawers, she was throwing the articles about and shutting the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean throwing the articles about - A. The articles were laying about in a rough state on the table, and she was shutting the drawers; when I went into the room I felt considerably from such conduct, I said, Mrs. Nissen the articles ought not to be throwed about that way, they ought not to be pressed or soiled, they are not so saleable; she said, oh, they are not injured, and she began to select more of the stock than she had selected, she went through the whole that I had in the box, she examined the whole that I had in the box, and selected what she thought would suit her, to the amount of three guineas, and she paid me for it, saying that she should be a very good customer, and begged I would put the lowest price. I did. In noticing what she had taken, I noticed that I had another ruff similar to what I had sold her, in looking for it I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the ruff that you have charged in this indictment - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that ruff that you could not find, took by you in the box, when you came from home. - A. It was</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it after you arrived at Mrs. Nissen's house. - A. Yes, I had, I am positive of that. At this time I had nearly put the whole of the things in the box again, of the quantity of the things in the box, I thought it was not as full as it ought to be. I know I missed some children's bodies of frocks, and I afterwards missed a cap and two tippets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about it. - A. Nothing further than the ruff, I told her the fellow ruff to the one I had sold her, in looking for it, I could not find it, she called her sister to go into the other room to look for it, she came back, and said it was not there, I looked again through the quantity of goods I had, and could not find it, I thought it very extraordinary, I said to Mr. Nissen I was surprised, she had my card, she said she could not recollect the person's name that had given her the card. The prisoner told me that she was in the same line of business I was, and that she employed thirty hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You went home, and then, by your attorney's advice, you applied to Hatton Garden office. - A. I did, between two and three o'clock the same day, the 25th of January, I went with the officer and the warrant to the house, when I had got there Mrs. Nissen had left home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the articles that you supposed you had lost. - A. Not one, I searched the major part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search for them as long as you pleased. - A. The officers searched as much as they thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the articles that she had paid for. - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the whole worth of the things that you lost. - A. Three pound twelve shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What is your name. - A.

               <p>Q. Pray did not that man just gone down, say that his wife packed up the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Was what Arundel said taken down by the magistrate, any thing. - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Mr. King, I ask you whether the prosecutor did not say to the magistrate when he was upon his oath, that his wife packed up the box the night before he took it. - A. So he positively swore, and repeated it again and again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you yourself make any memorandum of it. - A. I have a perfect recollection of it. I made a memorandum of it in my instructions, it formed a part of my instructions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was this said in the course of the examination; you attended, did not you. - A. I did, on the examination; when he was giving evidence before the magistrate, he stated that his wife packed it up, assisted, and was present.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. You have given first, the account that his wife packed it up, assisted, and was present. Now which of these statements did he make. - A. I am not certain, he either said that his wife assisted him or was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now I will call another witness.</p>
               <p>MR. LUKIN. Q. What did you hear the prosecutor say on the packing up the night before. - A. His words were, that his wife assisted him on the night before in packing up the box. I have no doubt of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it more than once. - A. I rather think he did. I have no doubt that he said his wife assisted him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You do not remember the precise words. - A. I remember the words, he said his wife assisted him. I believe it was in answer to a question asked by Mr. Alley, he said that his wife assisted him. I recollected it in drawing out the brief a few days ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, It is for you to say whether you will believe a witness like the prosecutor, who has been so materially contradicted by two respectable persons; if you think it necessary to call any other witness, I will go into it.</p>
               <p>Jury. The jury do not think it necessary to go into any other evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (to Prosecutor) Did you ever prosecute before this. - A. Not for any thing stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever prosecute before this for any thing that was not stolen, how odd things come out. Did not you apply to the magistrate to have your wife and mother taken up. - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190013"></xptr>Mr. Bolland. Did you charge your wife and mother with having robbed you. - A. I mentioned it to the officers, my wife had been from home and had taken out a few memorandums.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you and your wife were not upon very good terms. - A. At that time we were not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked who employed you as an accomptant, when you originally came to town you lived with Messrs. Hankey, he failed. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you had to seek for another situation as an accomptant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bothbridge employed you to settle that accompt. - A. He did. Lord Warwick was the ostensible person.</p>
               <p>Q. You learned on Wednesday at Hatton Garden that Miss Goodwin had recommended you to Mrs. Nissen, had you delivered any cards to Mrs. Nissen. - A. Perhaps Mrs. Arundel had.</p>

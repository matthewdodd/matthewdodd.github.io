                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart at Battersea—the prisoner was my pot-boy. On the 27th of July, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I missed fourteen sovereigns from my till—the key of the kitchen door will unlock the bar-door, but I did not know it then—I saw my money safe at half-past six that morning—the till was locked—there are two tills, one inside the other—the inner one goes within four inches of the bottom—this money was between the two tills—when we want the money to change, the inner till is taken out, and then we get to the gold and silver—there was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in a bag, and 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I lost no silver—there was a shilling dropped in the bar—I have not found any of the gold—I found the till still locked—if we go out, the till is locked, and the key put between two liquor-tubs—it was found there—I keep the key of the bar in my pocket—I charged the prisoner as soon as the money was missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Smith. On the morning of the 27th of July, about a quarter to seven o'clock, the prisoner cue into the kitchen—he asked where master was—I said he was outside—he said no more, but went and took the key of the parlour door, and tried the bar door—he said that was no use—then he went to the kitchen-door—he said, "This is the one"—he then went into the bar—I saw him stand with his hands close to the till—when he came out, he put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and said, "All I have taken is two cigars"—master was in the yard at the time, at work—mistress had not come out of her room.</p>

No, I never spoke to him—I did not ask him why he wanted the key to open the bar-door—I was alarmed when I saw it—when mistress came down and missed the money, she asked me, and I said I had not seen any money—I was taken up on suspicion—I did not tell my master of it.</p>

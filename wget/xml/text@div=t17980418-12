             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Miller, who keeps the George and Blue Boar: I was in the room about five minutes before the prisoner came in; I left the glasses there. I saw the prisoner come out with something in her apron; I went into the room and missed seven cruets; I apprized the waiter of it, and he went after her.</p>
               <p>Moody. I followed her down Holborn; she went into a public-house, and I lost sight of her; she offered the glasses and cruets to sell, with my name upon them, to the mistress of the public-house, but she is not here, she is dangerously ill in bed. She came again in about an hour into the same room, and I laid hold of her; she denied having been there before; she said, she wanted some beer. Her apron had some stains upon it; the cruets had contained different sauces for fish. I asked her what she had done with them, and she said, she did not know any thing of it. There was Cayenne, soy and ketchup, upon her apron, and salt and vinegar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in for some beer; the waiter told me, he did not sell beer; I had put down a shilling; I went away, and forgot my shilling. I had got almost to the bottom of Holborn, and I went back for my shilling; and he laid hold of me, and said, he was glad I was come back again, for he had lost some cruets. He began stripping me and using me very indecently; and the master kicked me so that I shall never be able to get my bread again.</p>

I said "Opposite"—he said "Oh no it is not, that is the broken-down trades<lb></lb>man that the sugar belongs to, I will fetch him"—he then crossed over, and brought in Lansdell, and introduced him as his brother—I bought 42 lbs. of sugar, at 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and I sold it in the regular way for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this is the parcel of pepper that Heslop brought on 28th March, it has my mark on it, and it has Travers &amp; Sons name on it—I refused to buy it—I said "I don't think you came honestly by it"—he said "Oh, I can show you where it came from, and I got it in the regular way"—he showed me a weight note from Travers—I looked on it with suspicion—he then said "You know where to find me, you have got my address"—he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a lb. for it—I said "It is not particularly cheap, Tomlin &amp; Rendall's price is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., here is their list"—he then said "My price will be 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said "I will take it"—having noticed that Mr. Walton's name was on the weight note, and as I had lost so much myself by persons obtaining goods from me, and selling them under price, I was determined to stop it, and I went and gave information of the goods being obtained, and offered at 25 per cent, under price—I said to Heslop "You will make out an invoice for it"—he left and got the invoice, and returned with it and wrote this "Paid, G.

               <p>I saw the prisoner and another person pass me between four and five o'clock, in Moorfields; they were running before they came to me, and one of them dropt something like silver, and I saw the other pick it up and wrap it in the skirt of his coat.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court. How far was they from you then? - About ten or a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Court.

               <p>I had just left the watch-house, and was having a halfpenny worth of saloop and somebody cried stop thief! and the prisoner and another was running I pursued him, when we came opposite Broker's-row we came up with them, and one of them (not the prisoner ) presented a pistol to me, and said, he would blow my brains out, and he dropt a silver pint mug, I picked it up, and pursued him down Long-alley; I cried, stop thief! and he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the man, that was with the man that had the pistol? - I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>My business is to sell saloop in Moorfields, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I cast my eyes about to see from whence it came, and I saw a man running, and another came close by me, and I said, my son, stop them.</p>
               <p>Court. What time in the morning? - About four or five o'clock, the man said, it was was a joke, it was fun, but I would not be funned that way, he would have avoided the matter if they could, but I said, stop them right or wrong; Cooper and my son run about one hundred yards, before they took the prisoner, then they got him in possession; I must say the prisoner behaved very genteel.</p>

               <p>Court. Where did your saloop barrow stand? - In what we call Middle Moorfields, at the extremity of Lower Moorfields, and just at the edge of Upper Moorfields, from which I could see into Moorfields, and down Brokers-row; after they got the prisoner in possession about a minute or two, I saw another man run past me, and he run up with a pistol, and rescued the prisoner out of their hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they had stopped the prisoner before that other man passed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Cooper at that time? - With my son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Where do you sit friend, with your saloop? - It is facing Bedlam, between the two mad houses, but I bless God, I have got my senses yet, there are a many cribby islands and places thereabouts, where people that do dark actions, love to go into.</p>
               <p>Court to young Miller. Where was you standing? - I was standing at the head of my father's barrow, my father said, I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230137"></xptr> not believe that man is a good man, stop him, said he, right or wrong; he said to the prisoner, he believed he was a bad man, or he would not have run, the prisoner said, it is only a game they are making of me.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to tell that at the first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I fancy he has been instructed on the outside? - No, I have not been told.</p>
               <p>Court to Door-keeper. Did any body come out and speak to this young man? - I remember one question was asked him, whether he thought the prisoner was guilty or no, there was nothing said to him in private.</p>

               <p>As I was in Moorfields, on Sunday morning, getting some worms to go a fishing, I saw three men running on Finsbury-pavement, that man was one, and they crossed over and jumped over the rails down by the side, I saw them before they came to the saloop man.</p>
               <p>Who was the foremost of the three men? - I cannot tell, the prisoner run along with him that had the plate, I saw one had the plate, he had it under his left arm, in the skirt of his coat, and a pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner to the man that had that in skirt of his coat? - Within about a couple of yards, the third man jumped over the quarter, he run right down the Middle Mall, and the two run down by Broker's-row, I saw nobody running after them.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner and the other man run by the saloop man? - Yes, the prisoner was first, the other was about a couple of yards behind him, they were very near one another.</p>
               <p>Did you run after them? - Yes, as far as the bottom of the rails, I saw two men run after them from the saloop barrow, the two men caught hold of one of them, and the other came up and said something to him, and he loosed him, while I was jumping over the quarter.</p>
               <p>Did you run again? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - They turned down Long-alley, and I saw them no more.</p>
               <p>How long might it be, between the two men getting hold of them and the other man coming up? - About half a minute, they were rather afraid of the other man that was behind, that had the pistol in his hand, I saw the pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not he follow? - Because I picked up two pieces of plate, I saw a man drop them, it was not the prisoner, it was the man that had the pistol; one was a tea cannister, and the other was a butter boat, I carried them home to my master, and he delivered them up to Mr. Grace, before the Justice, I was present, they were the same that I picked up.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, in the liberty of Moorfields; about a quarter after four o'clock, the prisoner was brought to me, and I found on him some keys, and some were given me by the other people that had picked them up, and these two crows were found in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>The butter boat produced by Freeman, who had it from Summer, and the tea cannister and mug also produced.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have one word to say, that very mug, if it is the same, a man swore he collared me, and took that mug out of my pocket, and they turned the man out of the Justice's office.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Angel wagon-office. I went to school with the prisoner—he was once upon the Stock Exchange—for the last two years he has been in any thing but a sane state of mind—these papers (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>), headed "The National Debt", and "Man's perpetual Inheritance, designed to illustrate the grand Income of the Country," are in his hand-writing—about three months ago he came to my office in Far<lb></lb>ringdon-street, with a great basket on his shoulder—it would contain from fourteen to twenty loaves of bread, or more—on my desiring him to put it down, I found in it a very small bottle of blacking—he took the basket away—I have frequently seen him so flighty—I considered him in a very unsteady state of mind—he has produced writings to me to the same pur<lb></lb>port as those produced—I think it was about six months ago that he first produced one of his writings—one day he called on my brother, I was dining there with a friend, and he came, in a very abrupt manner, knocked at the door, and asked for Mr. Harris—the servant asked him to walk in, while she took his name to her master—he said, "No, I will follow you up," and he did to, entered the room, and said, "I beg to apologize for my appearance, I have come a long distance"—he looked in a very dejected state—I and my brother asked where he came from—he said he had walked from his father's, who lived at Kew—I was satisfied, from his conversation, that he had not done so—I said, "I don't think you are telling the truth"—he said, "Did I say so?"—I said, "Yes, you just said you slept at your father's last night, and started from there this morning"—he said, "If I did say so I did not know it, my memory is very treacherous"—I do not believe him in his right mind—his manner was very incoherent and wild—I have fre<lb></lb>quently said he was deranged—I have not a doubt of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Compter. The prisoner was given into my charge for assaulting Mr. Lloyd the banker—I observed hit man<lb></lb>ner while in prison, in September, 1839, and from his general demeanor, I should say he was not competent to take care of himself—he was with me for a month for the assault, and was then discharged on his own recog<lb></lb>nizance—he did not know who it was he had assaulted—he asked me the question, "What have I done? tell me what I have done"—he was called up on two or three occasions to try to explain the matter, but he could not tell who he had assaulted, nor where he had committed the assault—he asked me four times at least, who he had assaulted—I did not consider him accountable—he was called up into the office 'about a week after he was in custody, and saw his father—I believe he said, "What do you want here? I can go out if I like, and I shall walk out with you; I have done nothing, and if you pay any money for me, I will never pay you again; I don't want any money, I have done nothing; who have I as<lb></lb>saulted?—where was I brought from?"—about two days afterwards, the father came again, and he was called into the office to see him—he said, "Well, have you done what you said? what am I to do now; shall I go out, can't I go out? let me go out"—I said, "Certainly not, you cannot go out, you must stop here"—he conducted himself in such a way, that our people did not consider him safe to be left by himself—some one was kept with him—it would not be safe to let him out at present—I should not be surprised at his turning to violence to-morrow.</p>

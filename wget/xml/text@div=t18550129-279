                  </hi>. I formerly lived at No. 7, Weymouth-street, Hackney-road. The prisoner rented the house—it only contained two rooms—the furniture in it was his own—he is the father of the deceased child, Frederick Bull; the mother died in Aug. last, leaving the deceased infant and another child behind; the other child is five years old—I am no relation to the prisoner, or his wife—I was living in the house at the time of his wife's death, and after her death I was placed by the prisoner in charge of the two children—I have not been paid any wages, since the mother's death—I took care of the children for sixteen months before her death—I was not with them at the time this child was born, it was two months old then—it was suckled by the mother until a fortnight before her death—it was not a healthy child, it was a thin weakly sort of child—after the mother's death, I had the entire care of both the children; the other was a girl—the prisoner continued to live in the house, after his wife's death—he used to keep the house himself, on Saturdays—he used to go out to work at 9 o'clock in the morning, and come home between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—before he went out in the morning he used to give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to get the bread and the butter with—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. every morn<lb></lb>ing, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides, sometimes it was only 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he always left me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides—he sometimes had breakfast at home, that was provided out of the money he gave me—he used not to breakfast every morning, not above three times in a week—I generally provided potatoes for myself and the children with the money he left me, and half a pint of milk for the child—I had as much as I wanted to eat of bread and butter—I had not after that sufficient left to provide for the two children—I gene<lb></lb>rally provided half a pint of milk for this child, and some rice for all our dinners—I have told the prisoner that I wanted something for the child, and I have got it a powder several times—I have told him that the child would like a bit of meat—I thought it was necessary for the health and support of the child that it should have some meat, but I could not get it out of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think I have told him that two or three times—I told him so, because I thought the child was very weak—it used to drink the milk I gave it, it could have drunk more—I have told the prisoner so—he said he used to give me all the money he could—I made those complaints to him up to a short time before the child's death—his answer generally was, that he gave me as much money as he could—a few days before the child's death, the furniture was seized—for a week or two previous to its death it could not eat bread, it continued to drink the milk—it had previously been able to eat bread very heartily—I told the prisoner that the child could no longer eat bread, and he told me to take him to Doctor Baker—I did take him to Doctor Baker; no medical gentleman attended the child just before its death, only Mr. Baker; Mr. Baker did not attend him—it was rather more than a fortnight before his death that I took him to Mr. Baker—I did not take him to any doctor within the last fortnight—during the last fortnight, the child did not appear to be</p>

               <p>affected with any malady or disease; he only seemed worse than usual in his appetite—he drank all the milk I offered to him; in my opinion, he could have drunk more—I have told the prisoner so during the last fort<lb></lb>night, and I have sometimes got some milk on credit, rather more than the half a pint—I do not recollect exactly what reply the prisoner made to me on those occasions—when the child died it was very thin, but it was always thin—it died on Saturday morning, about 9 o'clock—at 5 o'clock in the morning, before its death, it had convulsions, or something like it—I told the pri<lb></lb>soner at 5 o'clock that I thought it was dying—he said, u You do not mean that, do you?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live near Kings-land-road. In Jan. I was requested to open the body of the deceased, and make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I had never seen it during its life—I found it very much emaciated; I understood it was about a year and seven months old—there was no organic disease in any part of the body—the stomach was empty, the intestines also, and contracted—I could form no absolute opinion what the cause of death was without hearing evidence—I could detect no symptoms of disease whatever—on the left lung there was merely a small tubercle, which had not taken on any diseased action, and therefore was not in any way the cause of death—I have heard the evidence given to-day—I believe half a pint of milk was not sufficient to sustain it in life and health—if it had meat, arrow root and eggs in a continuous order, that would have been sufficient—I have examined the bodies of persons alleged to have died of starvation—I could not positively state what was the cause of the death of this child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the neighbourhood of the Hackney-road. I was called in to examine the body of the deceased child, on 16th Jan—Mr. Burchell had previously made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I examined the viscera with a view to ascertain, if possible, the cause of death—from the emaciated state of the body, and from the emptiness of the viscera, and there being no fatty matter in any of the tissues or organs of the body, I could come to no other probable conclusion than that it was in want, either in quantity or quality, of nutritious food—1 could detect no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290053"></xptr>
               <p>symptoms of organic disease in any part, excepting at the apex of the left lung there was a tubercular deposit, but not developed into disease, and therefore, in my opinion, could be no cause of its death—it is, of course, possible that the child might have died from some natural cause, wholly irrespective of absolute want of food—I am not warranted in speaking posi<lb></lb>tively—I should say the quantity of milk stated was not sufficient to sustain life for any duration; but having eggs, rice, arrow root, and meat occasionally, it is probable that might not be the decided cause of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My wife died about five months ago, leaving me with three children; my father is taking care of one of them; I got the witness to take care of the other two, the eldest and the youngest; the youngest died in a consumption; the doctor told me it was born in a con<lb></lb>sumption; that is Dr. Baker, who I had to attend to my wife; this has been a spite between me and my neighbours, because I owed the man of the chandler's shop opposite a little money for a few things that I had when I was out of work, about three months ago; he summoned me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at the same time my child was very bad; the money was to be paid on boxing day; I had not got it; I sent the young woman to ask him to wait till Saturday, but he put in the broker, and took away part of my goods for the money; the child died the next morning; I was to have the goods back by paying him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday, and the landlord took them and locked them up in his back yard; and when I offered him the money on the Saturday night, he would not give me my goods without he had a fortnight's rent; I said it was very hard, and I should not get the money till the following Saturday; we had a few words, and two days afterwards, he sent the same broker again, and seized the rest of my goods, taking away my bed and everything, leaving me with the young woman in the two rooms, with the corpse on a broken chair; that was all the furniture we had left; they went and told Mr. Maddox, the beadle, that I had neglected my children, and that one had died from want; I went to the beadle's place, and took him to Mr. Baker, who said it was his belief that the child died from consumption; the beadle said he should write to the Coroner on the subject, and then it was delayed a whole week without any notice being taken of it, and I was calling at the beadle's house every morning; the Inquest was on the following Saturday, and the very man that seized my things was on the Jury; they were all decided except that one man, and he said he would not have it settled in that way; I have been told since that I ought not to have had such a man on the Jury, but I did not know anything of it then, not having had such a thing happen to me before.</p>

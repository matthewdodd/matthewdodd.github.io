                  </hi> I am a constable of the Great Western Railway. The pri<lb></lb>soner was a porter in the Paddington-goods Department—I take the porters time at the lodge-gate, and a pass for anything that has to be taken out again—a clerk on the platform gives the pass. On 16th April the men went of work at twenty minutes past ten o'clock—the prisoner went at twenty minutes to eleven—he was leaving alone—he usually went with the other—they are all supposed to leave at one time—I know no reason for his stay<lb></lb>ing—I saw something under his arm, and asked what he had got there—be said, "A chicken, which I bought in South Wharf-road"—that is two or three minutes' walk outside the premises—he must have gone out at the lodge-gate to have gone there—I said, "You know my duty; you must give me a pass"—he said, "I have not got one, I could not get one; for God sake don't say anything about it"—I sent for Mr. Collard.</p>

                  </hi> I am chief inspector of the Great Western Railway police. On 16th April I went to the lodge, and asked the prisoner when he got the chicken—he said he bought it of a man in South Wharf-road—I asked his name—he said he was a stranger—if a man bought a fowl he ought to apply for a ticket—there would be no difficulty in doing so in an honest transaction—I went to truck 730, and found a large tea chest full of poultry—a piece as large as a book had been removed from under the cor✗ to make an opening—something had been extracted—I took it next morning to Newgate-market—it was there opened—it contained five layers of twelve fowls, but the top layer only contained eleven—there was a vacancy of the size of a fowl—the rest were stowed as close as could be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell him that what he said would be brought against him, and he need not say it unless he liked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he would not require a ticket to bring a hammer out, or his dinner—the men are not always searched.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Cook and Wetherley.

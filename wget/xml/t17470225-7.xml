            . I am Headborough; as there were several Officers of us together, we were walking about to see if we could find any disorderly People; we heard a pretty great Noise at the House where the Prisoners were; we all of us went in, when the Door was opened, that short Man, Cordoso, dropped the Buckles; I shut the Door to prevent any more coming out, for some made their Escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that little Man that dropped the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Newet. Yes, from his left Arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Newet. About Eleven o'Clock, it was last Tuesday was a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent for you?</p>
               <p>Newet. Every Tuesday Night the Officers meet together, and we went out then to see if we could find any disorderly People; we heard a Noise at this House, and when they opened the Door we went in, and that little Man dropped the Buckles from under his Arm; I ran to the back Door, I saw two go out there, and I ran to the Door to prevent any more from going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity of things were there?</p>
               <p>Newet. There were more things than the Buckles found in the House; when we entered the House there were Twelve besides what made their Escape, of Boys and Women.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you saw the other three Prisoners as well as Cordoso.</p>
               <p>Newet. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the other things besides the Buckles ?</p>
               <p>Newet. There were some Silk Stockings, some Seals, and some Screws.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with all the Things?</p>
               <p>Newet. What we took away we have here, there was about fourteen Yards of Duffil Cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. to John Savage. Do you know the Prisoners at the Bar? What do you know of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Savage. I work for Mrs Hartland, and have done for sixteen or seventeen Years, and I know that some of these Buckles belong to Mrs Hartland.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Savage. The Officer.</p>
               <p>Court. You say some of the Buckles you know belonged to Mrs Hartland?</p>
               <p>Savage. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to charge the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Savage. No, my Lord, I made some Part of them the white Metal, but here is another Workman, one Mills.</p>
               <p>Mills. I made part of these yellow Buckles for Mrs Hartland.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holloworth, the Constable. Did you search that Man?</p>
               <p>Holloworth. Yes, about two Hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Holloworth. I was present when they were taken: we were told that a Pack of Thieves used that House, and a Pack of Jews to buy the things, and there were six of us and we went to take them, and I know these are some of them; six of us rushed in all at once, and I thought Newet had taken the Buckles from under Cordosa's Arm, but he says that he dropped them, and he took them off the Ground.</p>
               <p>Q to the Prisoner, Jacobs. What have you to say?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. My Lord, I work at the Water-side, I help to unload Lighters, and when I came out from my hard Labour, it was about ten o'Clock, being late, we got ourselves a little merry in Thames-street. I comes in at the Sign of the Cock Ale-house, in Petticoat-lane, at one Loaf's and I asked for my Wife; says they, your Wife is gone to the Woman's that mends Stockings for you; I goes into this Place and I sees my Wife there, I said, Peggy, how came you to stay so long? I had not been there above five Minutes, before the Officers came in, and took my Wife and I to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holloworth, the Constable. What was this House where you took these Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Holloworth. At one Mrs Grey's in Cobb's-court, near Cox's-square, Spital fields, a little nasty Hole, where they sold Gin. We took Twelve, and and Eleven were sent to Prison.</p>

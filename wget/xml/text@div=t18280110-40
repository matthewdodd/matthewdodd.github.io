On Sunday morning, the 6th of January, Drury requested me to have an eye to the house, as she was going out - I heard a knock at Mr. Muckleston's door, about eleven o'clock - I went into our area, to answer it, as I can see Mr. Muckleston's door - I saw a young man there, a stranger; it was not the prisoner; he asked me if Mrs. Turner lived there - I told him No, that Mrs. Drury live there; he then asked me if that was Drummond-street - I told him No, he must go to the bottom of the street, and turn to the right and left - I went in, and did not see him go away; in about half an hour, a gentleman, who was in my master's parlour, called me, and said he had seen two men coming from this house - I was up stairs - I immediately came down, opened the street door, and saw three men walking and talking - I called Stop thief! they were four doors off, walking slowly away together - I called Stop thief! Stop thief! I ran after them, and they ran before me; they ran up Coburg-street, two on the left hand side, and one on the right; one of them turned down a cow-yard - I followed that man; he ran into the cow-house - I went into the cow-house, but could not see him there - Hawkins went into the cow-house, and soon after brought the prisoner out of it; this bottle of wine was given to me out of the cow-house, by Seabrook; when the prisoner was brought out, he appeared to be the same man as I was pursuing - I am sure of him - I have not a doubt of him.</p>

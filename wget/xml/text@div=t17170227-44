The Prosecutor deposed, that his Wife Lying-in, and he going to buy some Provisions, and invite the Gossips to the Gossiping, he was opposed in the Strand by the Prisoner and two Men, who knock'd him down; and one of them held a Sword pointed to his Breast, while the Woman kneel'd down and rammag'd his Pockets: That when he got up he pursued them; they made some Passes at him, but he followed them so close, that he took the Prisoner, and had her apprehended. The Prisoner pleaded in her Defence, the Prosecutor pick'd her up, and carried her into a Brandy-shop, and gave her part of a artern of Cherry-Brandy, and then would needs go into a private Room, and there gave her another, offering her a Shilling to lie with her; that he gave her 9 d. and would have had his Mony again, which because she would not give him, he fell a swearing she had robbed him. She brought the Mistriss of the House, and a Girl, who deposed the same.

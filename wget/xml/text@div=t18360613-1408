On the 7th of May I was washing my own clothes, and hung them in the beck garden to dry—about nine o'clock I was in the back room, which looks into the garden, and in consequence of observing something, I ran out, and my clothes were gone—I saw a dark shade when I ran out, and saw the prisoner on the wall—he dropped from the wall—I called out "Stop thief" as loud as I could, and ran to the front of the house, and stopped him myself—my niece ran out—I knew him to be the same man—he had no shoes on on the wall, nor when I stopped him—I laid hold of him and said, "Tell me where my clothes are"—he said, "I know nothing of your clothes"—I said, "Tel me where they are, and then you shall go"—I afterwards found the shift and counterpane in the next garden, under the wall where he dropped, and gave them to the policeman—the counterpane belongs to my niece, Elizabeth Hollington, who is the wife of George Hollington—he rents this house—my aunt live with us—I ran out when the alarm was given, and saw the prisoner drop from the</p>

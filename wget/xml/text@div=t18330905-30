            . I am a private in the 2nd battalion of the 1st regiment of guards. I went on guard on the night in question, at a quarter before twelve o'clock, and at about half-past twelve o'clock the prisoner came to me at my box, near the prosecutor's door; he asked if the people at the public-house were gone to bed; I said I thought not as there was a light in the house - he said it was of no consequence, he could get in as they had left the window open for him - I thought he lived there, as I knew he had lived there before - he said he had got in at the window before - he opened the window, went in, and shut it down, and I saw no more of him till he was at Bow-street.</p>

             (police-constable T 104). I took the prisoner; I found half-a-crown on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I left, the prosecutor told me if I was out of place, to come and sleep there, which I did for six nights - he told me of a situation, which I went and got, but I returned there to sleep that night - I asked him to lend me 5s., which he said he could not, as he had not a farthing in the world - I then borrowed 6d. of a young man and went away - it was impossible for me to get into the bed-room without being heard.</p>
               <p>JOHN BODGER. The prisoner was not in the house in the morning, but the window shutters were open, which I had shut too when I went to bed.</p>

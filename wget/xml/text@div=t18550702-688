                  </hi>. I spoke to the elder prisoner about this receipt for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. somewhere between 12th and 15th June—I asked him first how he came to pay so much as three cents per barrel for stowing, when it could have been done for less; he said that was what he paid—I then said, "It strikes me that this bill, like the others, is the mate's handwriting"—he denied it strongly, and said his son never wrote any bills for him—I told him I was sure it was his son's writing, and I showed him the log book and some letters and said, "Your son wrote this as well as the log book"—he said, "It is a d—lie, my son never wrote it"—he afterwards recollected and said, "Oh, by-the-bye, my son did write a bill for the <hi rend="italic">stevedore</hi>, for he could not write himself;" that was about half an hour afterwards—he did not say it was this bill, but this bill was before him at the time—they were all tied together as he delivered them—this is the only bill with respect to the <hi rend="italic">stevedore</hi>—I then found fault with him for not making the man make his mark to the bill, if his son wrote it out—he said it was very wrong; he ought to have done so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">George Wheatland, Sen.</hi> I did not say that my son wrote that hill; I told you that I believed the <hi rend="italic">stevedore</hi> asked him to write a bill, as he could not write English, being a Frenchman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He stated that his son had written a bill for the <hi rend="italic">stevedore</hi>, and there was no other but this.</p>

             sworn. - I am under gardener to the Duchess of Gloucester; I called up the last witness one Sunday morning, and we went across the road to the gate leading into this wheat field, and saw the prisoner upon his hands and knees crawling in the wheat under the hedge; then when he came to the top of the wheat field, he came out, and had got about twenty yards from the place where we first saw him; we thought he was hiding something; we went to look, and found a bundle; then we thought we would go and look whether he would come back to it, and then we met him coming back towards the field; we asked him whether he belonged to it or not, and he said he did not, and whether he had not been stealing that property, and he said he had not; then he tried to get away from us, and Mr. Collins laid hold of him by the collar, took him down the garden, and as he was putting his coat on, he found the spoons in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from Mr. Winbolt's house? - A. About a mile and a half.</p>

I was going to the Serpentine-river to bathe, and going through this field, I stopped to ease myself, and there I found this bundle lying, I picked up the spoons, and put them in my pocket; I remember seeing these two men upon the style; I went back to ask them if they knew any thing about it, and they took me into custody.</p>

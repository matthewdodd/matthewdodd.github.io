               did falsely, fraudulently, and feloniously remove from four knee-buckles to four other knee-buckles, certain stamps, marks, and impressions, to wit, the King's Head and the Lion Rampant, with intent to defraud the King

               <p>A second count, for transposing and removing the said stamps, marks, and impressions, from one buckle to another.</p>

               <p>I am deputy warden of the assay office -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish the evidences to be examined apart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. If you chuse it, they shall; but all the world may be here, for any thing it signifies.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. You need not give yourself any anxiety about it.</p>
               <p>Court. If you desire it, they shall.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. I do desire it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rushforth. These four buckles I produce, had the hall stamps; they are not put on at the hall in the shape they are; they have the marks of the Goldsmith's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310098"></xptr> Company upon them, but not the stamps, as put on at the hall; the two marks on the shoe-buckle; are close together, when we strike them, one on one side, and one on the other; it has been done so for six or eight months; with respect to the knee-buckles, they are put close together; these shoe-buckles appear to me to be marked as knee-buckles; the stamps are both on the same side, and the marks are bottom upwards; I really do think that these buckles were not marked at the assay-office; these buckles are silver.</p>
               <p>Court. Before these last eight months, were the marks on shoe-buckles in a different form? - When the duty first took place, we marked them pretty near together.</p>
               <p>Then, for ought you know, these might be marked then? - I do not apprehend they could; if they had been marked in a finished state, there would have been a sink round the stamp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. One is the King's mark, the other is the assay mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a lion passant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then, I submit there is an end to the indictment, for it describes it to be a lion rampant.</p>
               <p>Court. You must acquit the prisoner.</p>

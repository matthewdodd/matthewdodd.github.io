I missed the ten pound note the day after I received it. I received it on the 5th of September. I received change of Foster, Lovett, and Company, change of a check of forty-seven pounds, five shillings in four ten pound notes, a five pound, and a two pound.</p>
               <p>Q, Had you taken account of the numbers - A. I had not. When I first received them I folded them together, and placed them in the middle of a pocketbook, which I put into my pocket; they were separate from other notes. On returning home it was rather late; in the afternoon I was going out, I placed the pocket-book in the iron closet, with the contents exactly as I received them, without opening the pocket-book, or examining it. The iron closet is in a room in the house; I locked the iron closet, and put the key in my pocket. I went out that evening, in a few minutes afterwards I came home, near twelve at night. I did not open the closet that night, I went to bed; the key of the iron closet I am certain was in my pocket when I went to bed. When I returned home, I found one of my children was not well, and when I went to bed I laid my coat down in the children's room, with the key in my pocket. The prisoner slept in a room beyond the children; she must pass the children's room to come out. About nine o'clock the next morning, I took the pocketbook out of the closet, and replaced it in my pocket. I found my coat in the children's room in the place where I put it. I found my coat in the same situation I had left it. I took the key out of the pocket about half an hour before I took the pocket-book out of the closet. I afterwards opened the iron closet with the key I found in my pocket. I put the book into my pocket, without examining it; I went out a little before eleven o'clock; I left the putting the bankers names on the notes; then I took out my pocket-book; I was at the lottery office, Somerset-house. I opened my pocket-book for the purpose of endorsing the notes with the bankers names. Immediately I took the notes in my hand, I perceived they were not folded up in the same way that I had left them. When I received them, I folded them altogether across, and then back again, to make them in a small compass. When I took them out at Somerset-house, the centre one was separate, folded by itself. The different position struck me; and I counted the notes instantly, and I found there were but thirty-seven pound instead of forty-seven pound. There were three tens, I had four tens. I returned home, and made enquiry of my wife, and also of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner particularly if she had seen or had got any thing of the kind of the ten pound note. She pretended total ignorance of the thing; she said she had not any thing of it. She then went down stairs to search about the sweepings of the room, to see if by chance it might be dropped there. She returned and said she saw nothing of it. As I had not counted the notes over, I was uncertain which way it could be taken; I had not counted them with my finger, I merely followed the cashier with my eye. With that I went to the bankers, Messrs. Foster and Lovett, to ascertain the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300019"></xptr>number of the notes. The cashier who paid me is here. He gave me the number and date of the note. I stopped payment at the bank; after that I took no further proceedings. When I went home I pressed it more closely to the prisoner the same day, I believe it was, I am not certain whether I charged her with taking the key out of my pocket. I think I charged her as closey as that; she so solemnly denied it. I felt I was doing her an injustice to suspect her at that time. I heard nothing of the note, and gave up all suspicion that it was her. On Tuesday, the 8th of the present month, it was in September I lost the note; she continued in my service. On the 8th of November a piece of a key was discovered in one of my drawers; the prisoner was out at the time I made the discovery; when she came home I asked to look at her keys, to see if it was any of the keys belonging to her. I was then determined the prisoner should leave my service. That circumstance induced me to give her warning. On the Saturday following she had warning to quit as soon as she could, or otherwise. On the Thursday following she was sent out on an errand in the evening, and I had business which led me out a few minutes afterwards. On my going out I found the prisoner instead of being in her errand, I found her in conversation with the witness Starr, he is a cobler that keeps a stall. I stopped to listen to their conversation. I thought I heard the witness Starr say, what can they do, unless they find it out. Her answer I could not make out, but I heard again, you must get a new ward to it. I then said to the prisoner, now do not idle your time here, I have heard all your conversation. She said she was speaking about boots; I said, boots do not want new wards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there - A. About three quarters of an hour; I went to Wigmore-street, and waited some time there, not more than three quarters of an hour; certainly I returned home, and found Starr and his wife standing at my door; I know no more. The prisoner was my only servant, she attended in the morning to get up the children, and to do what was to be done.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember her coming and leaving any thing with you - A. Yes, next Wednesday three weeks, I believe it is, I do not know the day of the month, between six and seven in the evening I believe it was, she came and rang the bell of the house where I live, and asked permission to come up stairs into my room; I met her on the stairs; she came into my room; my wife was there, no one else there; she said, she wanted to speak to my wife; she presented a little parcel tied up in a rag or silk, I do not know which; she said, it contained pawnbroker's tickets, and requested her to take care of them for her; I said to my wife take them, and take care of them for her; she said, her mistress made a rule to overhaul the servants boxes before they went away, she was going away on Saturday; on the next day she came again, she asked me to lend her eighteen pence, she came to my shop; I lent her the eighteen pence reluctently; she said it was to pay a score over at the public-house. I then requested my wife to look at the packet of tickets to see if they were worth the eighteen-pence; my wife opened the parcel in the evening; my wife told me there was a ten-pound note in it. I desired her to go, and fetch the girl directly; she went and knocked at the door; I saw the prisoner about half past eight o'clock, she came to me that same evening to where I was at work; when she came I said why did not you come sooner, I have lost these tickets, you must go with us, and stop the these things; I saw the girl was confused, and immediately somebody spoke to her at the door, whether it was Mr. Denham I cannot say. The girl said, if it was lost she must find it again, that is all the girl said. I said to the prisoner if there is any thing valuable in it, you must offer a reward. My wife went down with the packet to Mrs. Denham, and Mrs. Denham cut the note out; I never saw it opened.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness the shoemaker. I did not know the prisoner until a week before this accident, that is the first time I saw the girl. On the 9th of this month, she brought this packet, on that day she brought me a parcel, she said, she wished me to take care of it for her until Saturday night; she said, they were pawnbroker's tickets; she said she was going to leave her place on Saturday night, and her mistress looked over the servants boxes, she did not wish her mistress to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce the parcel to you - A. Yes, it was sewed up in a piece of linen cloth; I kept the parcel without examining it until Thursday evening, I examined it then by the request of my husband, he desired me to open it; on opening it I found a few pieces of paper, apparently a letter cut up as pawnbrokers tickets, there were no pawnbroker's tickets in it; on opening the linen further, I found a bit of whity-brown paper, and in that a ten-pound note; I directly sewed it up as near as I could to what it had been before. I went down, and acquainted my husband of it; he desired me to fetch the girl; I went and knocked at the door; the girl told me she could not come just then, she would come in half an hour. She came in half an hour after that; my husband told her he had lost the parcel; the girl appeared to be flurred. My husband asked me to go to her mistress, and ask her if she had lost any thing; the girl was gone then. I went to her mistress, and on getting to the door, I met the girl; she desired me not to leave the parcel with her master; I told her I wished to speak to her master and mistress. She again desired me not to shew it to her master; I said, how can I shew it him when I have lost it. I went the second time, the first time she was engaged, and could not speak to me; the second time I went into the parlour, I shewed the parcel in the presence of the girl, the mistress' father and mother; the mistress requested me to open it she gave me a pair of scissars to cut it open; the ten-pound note was in it. The mistress' father, told her she should go to the watchhouse directly;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300020"></xptr>her mistress took the note out of the parcel. The girl begged they would not send her to the watch-house, but to send her home to her own mother. That is all I heard pass. Mrs. Denham took the ten-pound note out of the rag herself; the patrole had it. That is all I know.</p>

I took the note afterwards, and then I called the patrole and delivered the note up to the patrole.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the note that you delivered to the patrole was the note that was taken out of the parcel - A. There was every probability of it.

               <p>MR. HALL. I am a constable. I received the parcel of the patrole; it is in the same state now as when delivered to me.</p>
               <p>MR. DALTON. I am cashier at Foster, Lovetts, and Co's. banking-house.

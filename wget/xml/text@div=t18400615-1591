                  </hi>I am a jeweller, living in Oxford-street. On the 21st of May the prisoner came to see some wedding-rings—I showed her a tray—I had sold one out of it before she came—the tray was full all but one—she tried several, and selected one in particular, and asked the price—I turned to weigh the ring, and told her it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said it did not suit her to take it, but she would call another time (the next night, I think, she said)—she quitted the shop in rather a hurried manner—I looked, and missed another ring from the tray—I sent my lad after her—he caught her and brought her in—I have not found it—my apprentice said he saw her with a ring in the street—she first denied having any ring at all, but afterwards stated she had a brass one, which she threw away into the street, and then she said it was a half-sovereign she threw away.</p>

                  </hi>I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner come into the shop—my master showed her a tray—she tried on some rings, and then left the shop in a very hurried manner—I went out after her, and caught her about three doors from the shop—she turned down the next turning—I went and looked over her shoulder, and saw her looking at the ring, as if she was looking for the hall-mark—I brought her back, and she told my master she had had no ring—I said I had seen her with one.</p>

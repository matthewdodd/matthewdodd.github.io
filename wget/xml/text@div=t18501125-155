                  </hi>. I am single, and know Mr. Deadman, a clog-maker, of Tanner's-hill, Deptford. I attended on his mother—I have occasionally taken orders from him—on 24th Oct., about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners in the shop, Pingrum was behind the counter, and Fielder on the customer's side; there was a female in the shop, and an old lady who had sent for me—Fielder had lived with Mr. Deadman, and I knew Pingrum—I saw him take a basket of clogs from behind the counter—they each took a basket—I asked what they were going to do; they said Mr. Deadman had sent them, and they were going to take them away—they each went out with a basket of clogs; Mr. Deadman came home, and I told him.</p>

               <p>my service up to 19th Oct.—he used to hawk clogs about the country for me—I had discharged him on 19th Oct., because I found him dishonest—I have employed Pingrum in the same way at different times—I did not employ either of them on 24th Oct.—I came home that evening, and missed five dozen clogs, worth two guineas—I saw them safe at nine o'clock that morning—the prisoners had applied to me on the Wednesday before for some more clogs, and I told them I would have nothing more to do with them—I gave them no order to receive these clogs—I have not seen them since—when I employed them they used to bring me the money every evening.</p>

I took the prisoners together at Deptford on 29th Oct., and told them the charge—Pingrum said he was hawking a basket of clogs, and going up Goodham-lane, in Kent, a man asked him where his license was, and said some hawkers were coming, and as he was hawking without a license he threw the clogs in the ditch and ran away—Fielder said the same.</p>

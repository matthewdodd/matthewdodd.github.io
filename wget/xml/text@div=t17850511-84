Griffin, Hubert, and Griffin; I know not what became of it; my house was broke open between the 13th and 14th of June last, by breaking through the partition of an empty house; and there were some hand-bills printed of the robery.</p>
               <p>Should you know the silk again? - I will not say.</p>

               <p>How much was you intrusted with? - Made and unmade 130 ells, what was not wrought was taken away in the round, as it was in the manner of weaving, there were about forty-six ells which were made.</p>
               <p>What sort of silk was it? - Black mode.</p>
               <p>In what condition was this silk when you first had it? - Fit to be wove.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was not this silk a warp ready for weaving? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Councel. Then this is what would be distinguished in your line of business as silk warp? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Was there any mark about this silk that you can speak with certainty to it again? - I saw it again at the dresser's, at Mr. Williams's, it was carried there to be dressed, the very day after thanksgiving day, that was the 30th of July; I can say it was the very work that I manufactured myself, it was together.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to my Lord Tankerville, my Lord lost an ass and foal last Wednesday or Thursday morning, they were taken away from very nigh the house, in <placeName id="t17940219-26-crimeloc145">Walton upon Thames, in Surry</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who had got the custody of the ass when you saw him? - This woman, the prisoner at the bar, was leading of it, and the other was leading of it with a bridle; when I came there I met them, the top of Seymour-street, my Lord stopped the ass himself, I was not there, my Lord sent for me to meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was some time before you saw it afterwards? - It was stopped about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; and the ass was my Lord's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that this woman took it? - Only by its<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190067"></xptr>being found on her. We lost three asses that same time last year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down below Harrow on the Hill ; I met this gipsy, I had a little lame horse, and they asked me whether I would chop this little lame horse for this ass? and I did; as I was coming along the high road the next day, there was a gentleman met me, and asked me whether I would fell this property? and he left me a card where to bring it. I never was in London before, they took me up at such a nonplus, and my husband being in the militia, that I don't know where to send to him. I have six small babies.</p>

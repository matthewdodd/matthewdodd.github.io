            . On the 31st of December, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop; she asked to look at a print that was at the bottom of a pile of goods, near the door; I told her I could not take them all down for her, we had got others that she would like as well; she left me and went to the shawl counter; I saw her look round to see if any body was noticing of her, I seemed to take no notice of her; after standing at the shawl counter five or ten minutes she left the shop; I followed her to the door; just after she got out of door she turned round to see if any body was looking; I immediately went after her, put my arm round her waist, and brought her back again to our shop, I took her up stairs, and directly I got her into the kitchen a shawl dropped from her pelisse; I saw it drop from her; I picked it up and told her it was our property.</p>

            . Q. You are shopman to the prosecutors, I believe - A. I am; I attended all that afternoon at the shawl counter; I shewed her nothing, nor did she buy any thing. When she quitted the shop Ashford followed her.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you recollect a lady being along with me buying a shawl that came to fifteen shillings - A. There were other ladies in the shop, one lady<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110013"></xptr>bought a shawl that came to sixteen shillings; I saw the prisoner come to the counter alone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What is the value of that shawl - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ashford. Did you see any person in company with the prisoner - A. I saw her talking to a person in the shop; she followed a person out, I did not see her come in with any body.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shawl and the other piece of print I bought over Blackfriars bridge; I met a man and a woman, they had several prints and shawls, they asked me if I would buy a shawl and a gown print; I asked him the price of this print; he said eighteen shillings; I told him I would give him nine shillings and sixpence for the print; he took it, and I gave him ten shillings and sixpence for the shawl.</p>

               <p>I heard a noise in my passage, and I looked and saw the prisoner going out with a bundle under his arm, he shut the door after him; he turned into a court, I knew there was no thoroughfare, and I waited for his coming out, I looked up the court, and I saw him knock at a gentleman's door; when he came out he had the bundle then, he said he had not been in my house, I said I was sure I saw him come out, I did not know I had lost any thing then; he then told me he wanted one Mrs. Thomson, a washerwoman; he said he was going over to the White Lion, I did not think of the garret, and he went away with the bundle, it struck in my memory to see if the garret was safe; my wife went up immediately, and hallooed out, the sheets are gone; I immediately went after him, and he took through a stable yard, he was walking on gently in Bishopsgate-street, I caught him with the bundle under his arm, I brought him back and sent for a constable, and gave charge of him; we searched him, and in his great coat pocket there was a shirt and handkerchief of my apprentice's, this is the bundle.</p>

               <p>I came across the water, a man came with me, and said he was going to call at a house for a bundle, and said if you will go and call at such a house I will come to you, and I was going to the White Lion to see for him. I came out of the hospital three weeks ago with a broken leg.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in trust at Greenwich Hospital. I am September last the infirmary of the hospital was under repair—the pri<lb></lb>soner was employed on those repairs—on the 7th of September I was at the infirmary when the men were leaving work—the prisoner was there—I saw him, and Marriott, Emmett, and Walton, leaving their work—they apperaed bulkey, and I followed them to the side door of Ingram's house in Thames-street. which is a plumber's—I had not a doubt that they had something under their clothes—they went in at the side door—I waited two or three minutes, and saw William come out—I asked him a question—I immediately went in, and met Marshall coming out, in company with Emmet—he had got his jacket on, then—It was off before he went in, and their bulky appearance was gone—the prisoner did not appear bulky when he came out—I saw Marriott counting something in his hand, which I thought was money—I could not tell whether it was silver or copper—I went into the house—Mrs. Ingram put her back against the inner door—I afterwards got in, and saw a quantity of copper lying on the floor of the shop—It was old sheet copper, of a similar description to what we had taken off the infirmary—I sent for an other—the copper was folded up very close, not as if to put in store, but in a very small space—there was about 1051bs. of it—the prisoner's employment was to take the copper off the roof—he did not return to his work—the policeman found some more copper.</p>

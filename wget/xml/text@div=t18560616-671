                  </hi>. I am driver and shepherd in the employment of Mr. Scales, and also of Mr. William Askew. I have the charge of from 600 to 700 sheep belonging to them, in Victoria Park—I missed forty-six of them on 15th May, fourteen of Mr. Scales's, and thirty-two of Mr. Askew's—I went to the premises of Mr. Williams, in the Skin-market, at Bermondsey, on the Saturday following, and saw thirty skins—nine of them were Messrs. Scales's, and twenty-one Mr. Askew's—they were skins of the sheep I had missed—they are not here—the sheep were not fit to be killed; they had to be fatted first, they were store sheep, poor sheep.</p>

N." on the rump and on the hip a mark with red ochre, one on the shoulder, and twice over the loins—that makes fourteen of Mr. Scales's—there were seventeen of Mr. Askew's marked with red paint on the shoulder; four with blue paint on the rump, and red paint on the head; and eleven with blue paint on the rump—the thirty skins I saw at Mr. Williams's had marks corresponding to those.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as carcase butchers and salesmen, in Whitechapel In May last we had 300 sheep in Victoria Park—on 16th May I received information, and on 17th went to Bermondsey Skin-market, to the premises of Mr. Williams—I examined thirty sheep skins, nine of which were skins of sheep I had sent to Victoria Park to graze—the other twenty-one were Mr. Askew's—they were obtained through me—part of them were purchased at the Metro<lb></lb>politan Market, and part came from the country—from what Williams told me, I went to St. George's-market, Southwark, and, after waiting there two hours, the prisoner came—I asked him if he had received any sheep lately—he said he had; forty-six on Wednesday night—about 10 o'clock or half past—I asked him who brought them to him—he said, a person named Bates, or some such name—he professed to have very little knowledge of him, and said, he lived near Edenbridge, in Kent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160171"></xptr>
               <p>—I asked him if he had seen him before—he said he had, and that he represented himself as the son-in-law of Mr. Johnson, of whom he had on former occasions bought sheep, and who he knew; that the sheep were brought to him to dispose of, and he was to have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a head for his trouble—I asked him how he, as a butcher, could think of killing poor store sheep, which part of them were—he said that he knew some of them were very poor, but he thought they were short of keep, meaning that there was a scarcity of grass—I asked him what he did with them—he said that he sent thirty carcases to Mr. Bucknall, of Newgate-market, twelve to Messrs. Dean and Hatton, of Newgate-market, for sale, and four he retained for his own shop—I asked him what he did with the skins—he said he sent thirty to Mr. Williams, of the Borough-market, for sale, and sixteen to Mr. Kelly—I should mention that the thirty skins, when I saw them, were all daubed over with red ochre, to disguise them, but it had not defaced the marks—I went to a room up stairs at the back of his premises—it appeared to have been a dwelling room at some former time, but had been swept out, sawdust put in it, and there was fresh dung in one corner, showing that sheep had been there very recently—there was no con<lb></lb>venience for slaughtering sheep in a proper way—there was a little place like a cellar—the yard was occupied with pigsties—he handed me very readily the receipt for 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which I think was in cash, and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a crossed cheque, of which payment had been stopped by Mr. Buck-nail.</p>

Fuller's—he said that the man of whom he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> them lived near Edenbridge—I am accurate in that; and that he was to meet him there on the following Tuesday—a policeman named Prescott was with me, in uniform—I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>

Mr. Mean, is that you? I thought I knew your voice"—while we were having some refreshment, she sent for her husband to a public house, about half a mile off—he came, and she said, "This is Mr. Mean, that you have heard me and my father speak of"—before he came, the prisoner said that the man he bought the sheep of was a tall man, with a squint eye—this man did not answer that description at all; he was a very big man, but had no squint—the prisoner said to him, "I have come down about some sheep I received from a man they accuse me of stealing them, a man who repre<lb></lb>sents himself to be a son-in-law of your father-in-law"—that is, Mr. John<lb></lb>son's wife's father—he said that he was very sorry for him, and very sorry such a thing should occur; but nothing relating to the sheep—I re<lb></lb>turned to town on Sunday evening.</p>

From suspicion, on the 22nd of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, I took an opportunity of watching them; I posted myself outside of the stable; I heard Hugger say to Wright, look out. Wright took his station at the door; Hugger went to the corn bin, and was filling his pocket; one of my servants was coming into the stable where they were; Wright gave Hugger a signal by a nod of his head; Hugger left off and pretended to be looking for a bottle. My servant left the stable, he only came for his whip; Hugger began filling his pocket again at the same place; then on two of my servants coming into the stable to finish the horsis, Wright gave Hugger the signal as before; I sent for a constable, he searched Hugger in my presence, he found upon him the chaff, oats, and beans in question, about a quart. They both acknowledged themselves guilty; said it was their first offence.</p>

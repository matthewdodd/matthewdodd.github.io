                  </hi>. I am a widow, at 28, Prince's Street, Deptford—the prisoner lodged with-me in Hughes's Fields for about two years in 1871 and 1872 with a woman he called his wife—I have seen him since several timet with Mary Weeks, and I saw his first wife about six weeks ago—in 1872 I went with her to Euston Station, and saw her off by the train.</p>

On 14th September I took the charge against the prisoner from a person calling herself Elizabeth Sesdon—I asked her in his hearing when she was married to him—she said "Thirteen years ago"—he said "It is 15 years since we were married at St. Ann's Church, Donegal Street, Belfast, and I thought that after a man had been away from his wife seven years he could marry again."</p>

I was present when the prisoner was brought in on the 14th—both women were there—I said "You are charged with marrying this woman Weeks, having previously married another woman"—he said "Yes, I did; I thought when a man was away from his wife seven years he could get married again"—he said he married the first woman about 13 years ago at St. Ann's Church, Belfast—I produce the marriage certificate, and also certificate of a marriage between George James and Mary Weeks.</p>

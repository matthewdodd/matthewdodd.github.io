                  </hi>. I am pot-boy, to James Maskell, who keeps the Adam and Eve, John-street, Clerkenwell. Between six and seven o'clock, in the evening, the prisoner was in the tap-room—he had a red handkerchief which looked as if something was in it—he first placed it on the table at which he was sitting, and had a pot of beer—there was a little disturb<lb></lb>ance in the parlour, but not in the tap-room—somebody present spoke to me—I went and sat opposite to the prisoner—I saw the handkerchief on the table—I took it up, and found a pint pot in it—I asked if it belonged to him, and if that was the trick he had been up to—he made no reply—he got up and went towards the door—as he got up I saw a half pint pot on the stool, which I had seen half an hour before on the table, opposite to where he was sitting—I took it up, and gave it to my mistress—the pot on the stool was open—the pot in the handkerchief was wrapped in paper, and then in the handkerchief—nobody was sitting by the pri<lb></lb>soner—House detained him—the pint pot belonged to Mr. Knight, the landlord of a public-house—the other pot is James Maskell's</p>

                  </hi>. I am a floor-cloth painter, living in Wynyatt-place. On Wednesday evening, the 18th of May, I was at the Adam and Eve with Buck—I saw the prisoner come into the tap-room—he seated him<lb></lb>self at my right hand—he had something in a handkerchief—he put it on the table—there was nothing on it before he sat down—there was nothing on the stool then—he got up again, and there was a half-pint pot on the stool—I spoke to the potman about him—I saw Buck tike hold of the handkerchief, and open it—I saw a pint pot in it, covered with brown paper—the prisoner walked towards the door—I stopped and asked him if he recollected me—he made a reply, but I do not know what—I asked if he recollected Mr. Williams's of the Sir John Falstaff—the potman took the pot from the settle, and gave it to the landlady—the other pot was taken by the policeman—no one sat on the settle with the prisoner.</p>

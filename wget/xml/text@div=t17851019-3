               <p>Is your wife here? - No, she went to bed an hour after, about nine; there was no servant; I heard the watchman cry twelve, and about five minutes after, I heard a noise alongside my bed, there is a little trap-door and a shutter, and I looked across it and saw a great light in the work-shop, and I saw a great part of the shop untiled, and the moon shone in through it, and I could see nobody; in about fifteen or twenty minutes after, I heard a great noise, it came from the head of the bed to the foot, and I saw a man come right through the tiling, which was the prisoner, there were two men more on the tiling when he came down, the cross pieces that go from the rafters were cut away, and this chissel was found on the tiles in the morning; he was standing on my bellows, I went back and got a short gun, which I always keep loaded, and I presented it to him through a hole, and it missed fire, I fired again, it missed fire a second time, then I awoke my wife and told her, then she got up and the prisoner hid himself, he was an hour and a quarter in the shop; I made my wife come down, I was afraid they would murder me, and my wife waited for the watchman coming full an hour, then a woman came by, my wife called her, and she got assistance, and I told them to break the door open; the door was fastened.</p>
               <p>Has he been in custody ever since? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am one of the constables of the night, I remember coming to the assistance of the prosecutor; I was called between twelve and one; I came to his shop in consequence of being sent for, it was the 20th of last month; I know the prisoner, we found him hid behind the water-tub in the shop, he has been in custody ever since; we tried to break the door open but could not, and the prosecutor sent his little boy to undo the door, and I took him to the watch-house, and he was committed; we searched but there was nothing about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer of Okehampton, Devonshire—in February, 1877, I advertised some meadow hay for sale—I received a communication from a person styling himself A. Woods, of 10, Spring Place, Wands worth—I burnt it with a subsequent similar letter on my change of residence—the letter inquired at what price I would deliver it at the station—in consequence of that communication I forwarded to Nine Elms two trucks of hay, about 4 tons 2 cwt.—the price was 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wrote to him for a reference, and received this memorandum and enclosure. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: Memorandum, February 13th, 1877, from W. Woods, London, to Mr. Joseph Sprague, Okehampton. Sir,—I enclose you memorandum with my name and address received from the bank yesterday. This I trust will be sufficient for you to see that I am well known to the Banking Company.—Yours obediently, A. W.; Birkbeck Bank, 29 and 30, Southampton Buildings, 12th February, 1877. Mr. Archer Woods, Spring Place, Wands<lb></lb>worth Road.) I also received this acceptance. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Acceptance, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable seven days after date. Pay to my order, value received, Joseph Sprague, February. 8th, 1877. Payable at the Birkbeck Bank, Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane.") I consigned some hay to myself at Nine Elms and I came by the train following—I took the acceptance to the Birkbeck Bank, and in consequence of a conversation which I had with a Bank clerk I went to Nine Elms station and stopped the hay—I had previously stopped it for the day—when I sent the hay I believed A. Woods was carrying on a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade—I did not get any money—I did not part with my hay to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I cannot say what I should have done if I had received the order for my bull on a plain sheet of paper—I made inquiries—I went to London Terrace—there was a shop, but not much in it—the bull was 10 months old—I described him in the advertisement as a young pedigree short-horned bull, 10 months old—I am not sure as to a word. (<hi rend="italic">Advertise<lb></lb>ment read</hi>: "A short-horned pedigree bull about 10 months old for sale by private contract. Apply R. Linnell, Moreton Pinkney, Byfield.) The advertisement appeared several weeks—I did not advertise the pedigree—I sent the pedigree before I sent the bull to the printed address on Wood's letters—this is it: he was by a bull called Kirk, grandsire Prince of Fausley. and great grandsire Earl of Windsor; I have not the herd-book numbers—I was not offered 10 guineas, nor anything else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge at No. 6, Redcross-court, Borough—the prisoner's husband rents the house, and is my land<lb></lb>lord. On the night of the 26th of April he applied to my mother for a week's rent—she could not pay it—he went down to his room, and I heard the prisoner using very low language, and calling the old woman hard names—I said my mother did not look more like the names she called her than her mother did, and then she called me the names myself—I had a bit of potato in my hand eating, and I flung it at her—then she took the chopper from the side of her kitchen fire-place in her kitchen (I must go through the kitchen to get to my room) she said, the first one that came down the stairs that night she would chop their b——head off—my mother came and locked the door—about half-an-hour after I went down for some water, and saw her with the chopper in her hand—I said, "I think you are going to do what you said"—she said, "Yes, I intend to do it"—I said, "I will see whether my head will be chopped off or not," and then she gave me a violent blow on the forehead—I flinched back from it, and received it on the top of my head, and did not receive the violent blow she was going to give me, or it would have been straight down my face—it came lighter on me through my falling back—I fell to avoid the blow—I called my mother down, and said, "I am murdered by the chopper"—she came to my assistance, and I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Charles Key, surgeon of Guy's Hospital. I saw the prosecutrix on the 26th—she had a wound on the left side of her head, it was not serious at all—she was quite sensible—it was about an inch and a half long, and a quarter of an inch deep, quite to the bone—the integuments of the skin were cut through to that extent—I have seen the chopper—a similar wound might be produced by just the sharp part of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Timothy Moreen, and live in the house. I was there the night this happened, and heard Mrs. Donovan and Mahoney's mother having words—Catherine Mahoney came down stairs, and the prisoner asked her husband if he had been up—he said, "Yes, and she says she will pay me the rent to-morrow night"—the prosecutrix said the prisoner was a w—to her own brother, and she could prove it, she took the child in her arms, and took the chopper, and said, "If you call me that again, I will hit you with this"—the prosecutrix said, "I can prove it"—the husband got up to hit her—I took him by the hand, and said, "Have sense, man, and don't touch her"—she then threw the potato in the prisoner's face—she went up stairs, and came down after<lb></lb>wards, and said, "Now I will know whether I am to be hit with the chopper or no," and she hit her, and Mrs. Mahoney came down and took her by the hair of her head—the prisoner's husband was beating the three women, with the child under their feet—the prisoner struck two blows with the chopper—the first took effect in the face—she had a child in her arms—she did not strike her first on the arm—if it had not been for the expressions of the prosecutrix, it would not have happened—nobody could stand them—I believe she struck twice with the chopper—I know she struck once—I believe this is the chopper—it was left in the room—the policeman came for it, and got it.</p>

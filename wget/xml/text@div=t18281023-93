About a quarter-past eleven o'clock on the night of the 9th of October, I was in my parlour, looking through the window, into the shop - I did not see any one, but my daughter said there was somebody in the shop; I heard a noise, which I thought was a dog, but I found it was a man, going on his hands and knees - I sprung into the shop, and saw the prisoner with the till in one hand, and the keys in the other; I saw him plainly before he left the shop - I followed him about a stone's cast, and cried Stop thief! the watchman stopped him; there was 5s. 7d. in the till altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What sort of a window is there between your shop and parlour? A. It is all window - there is a curtain before it, but it was drawn back; there is a gas-light in the shop - I lost sight of him, but did not say I should not know him again.</p>

            . I am a night-officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I asked what he had been doing - he said Nothing; I waited some time, the prosecutor and his wife came in - she identified him directly; I asked if she was sure he was the man - she said Yes; she did not hesitate: he begged I would let him go, and told me his name was Williams; I said I could not let him go - he said if I would he would tell me the whole - that he fell asleep, and some person stole his hat and shoes, and he did this to buy some more, as he did not like to go home without them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she say she knew him by his black whiskers? A. No, by his black head.</p>

Maurice Mer<lb></lb>rick Ived in the house at the time—on the 27th of March, I went out at near nine o'clock in the evening, leaving two children in bed—when I re<lb></lb>turned, I missed this jacket from the kitchen table—I afterwards saw it hanging up at Mrs. Phillips's door for sale, and got it.</p>

On the 25th or 27th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this jacket to sell—it looked very small, and I asked if it was his property—he said, "Yes"—I said I did not believe it, it was so small—I asked him to try it on, which he did—it was short in the sleeve, and I said, "It is not yours"—he said it was, that he was a waterman, and wanted to sell it as it was too small—I gave him</p>

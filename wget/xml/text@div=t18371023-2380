                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock-manufacturer, and silversmith, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On the night of the 21st of September, the prisoner Wells came to my shop, about half past nine o'clock, and pro<lb></lb>duced a watch, and asked if I would purchase a metal watch—I asked the price—he said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I opened it, and found it was a gold one, and had the Hall mark—I asked him if it was his own—he said it was, and that it did belong to his grandfather—I went in, and informed Mrs. Keyzor, then came out, and asked his name—he said he had been to my shop a few days be<lb></lb>fore, and sold me some coin, and I had his name—I opened my books—he pointed to his name, and I found he had sold me some old coin for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and given his address, "10, College-street, Camden-town"—I said if his address was all right, I would purchase it, but I should go with him to see if it was right—I went behind the counter, and put my hat and coat on, and he ran off—I ran after him through different streets—I offered some boys 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to catch him—they ran and caught him—I came up, and he said, "Take me to the station-house"—a policeman came up—I gave him in charge, and ordered him to take him to the station-house while I went borne to put my coat on—when I went to the station-house the prisoner seeded very much agitated, and wished the office to be cleared of all stran<lb></lb>gers—he then said that he bad been innocently brought into it, and was very sorry for it, and that he had a sister who lived at a watch-maker's at Is<lb></lb>lington, who he believed had stolen the watch, for he had had suspicion of it; and that every knock that came to the door, he was afraid somebody was coming, and he had advised his sister to part with it; and that there were two more watches which he had pawned, one at Rid path's, at Somers-town, aid the other at Camden-town, he begged the policeman to go to his wife and ask her to give up the duplicates.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 38.) I took charge of Wells at the top of Rathbone-place—as he went along, he said, "Policeman, if I have done any thing wrong, I have been led into it"—I have heard Mr. Keyzor's statement of what passed at the station-house—it is correct—Wells gave his address, "15, Mansfield-place, Mansfield-street, Kentish-town"—I went to that house, and Wells's wife let me in—the prisoner Summers was called, and I told her I wanted to see her—that the Inspector wanted to put a few questions to her—she said she would go with me, for she had done no person any wrong—I gave her into the custody of another constable, and took the prisoner's wife on one side, eight or ten paces, and went into the back room on the top floor—I got two duplicates from her, and the two women went to the station-house—when Summers was charged be<lb></lb>fore the Inspector with stealing watches, he asked her where she got them—I did not say she had better tell about it—when I first went to her I said I hoped it would not detain her long—her sister and Wells's wife, in the presence of the Inspector, both told her it would be better for her to tell the truth—another brother's wife said, "Tell the truth, Eliza,</p>

               <p>tell where you got the watches"—she said so several times—she did not say it would be better or worse for her—I cannot say I heard her use that expression—she said it would be easier for her to tell the truth—that was when she was hesitating, after the Inspector had questioned her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was she taken to the station to see if she would make a sufficient case for her detention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was in consequence of the confession of Wells I was sent to bring her—it was not to get a statement from her—she merely came voluntarily with her sister—I took her by the hand all the way to the station-house—I took her there to be questioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock maker and live in High-street, Islington. The prisoner Summers lived with me as servant for a considerable time—I believe I have seen Wells call on her once or twice, but he never came in to my knowledge—she had left my service ten days when she was charged with stealing the watches—she had given me warning, and went of her own accord at the end of the month—the watch produced is mine—I had several watches in a cupboard at the top of my house—I lost the key of that cupboard while she was in my service, and afterwards found the watches were gone—I broke the cupboard open after the prisoners were apprehended, and then missed the watches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How lately before had you seen this particular watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been perhaps three quarters of a year—I had opened the cupboard, but not noticed that particular watch—there might be a dozen and a half watches there—I have not a doubt of its being mine by the Hall mark and the case—it is the Irish Hall mark—there is no lion in it</p>

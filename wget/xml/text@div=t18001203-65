             sworn. - I am a smith, servant to Mr. Hale: On Tuesday morning, the 4th of November, I observed some iron behind the belows, which was an unusual place for it; on Wednesday morning it was gone, and some more placed in nearly the same spot; I informed Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030042"></xptr>Hale of what I had seen, and the same evening that iron was taken out of the shop by the prisoner, Tyler.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I found the iron was gone, and James Hale and I followed him to Grub-street; when he had got into St. Paul's Church-yard, I saw him take the iron from his side, and put it upon his shoulder, and carried it along Cheapside, and when he got into Wood-street, he took it from his shoulder, and carried it in his hand; I saw him go into a house in Grub- street; he staid in the house about a minute; it appeared to be an old iron shop; the instant he came out of the shop, James Hale and I went into the shop, I demanded the iron that the man had just sold with a hairy cap on; he asked me what iron it was, and told me there had been no person there selling iron lately; I told him there had, for I had watched him in, and watched him from the shop that he had taken it from; I desired him to go after the man; he told me, he would not, I might go after him myself; I told him I would have the iron before I went out of the shop; he then went round the counter, and gave me up one piece of iron; he asked me if I could swear to it; I told him I could; I went round the counter, and there I saw the rest that had been taken from my master's shop; I told him it was my master's property; I asked him what he had given for it; he said, never mind that, you are welcome to it; I desired him to weigh it, which he did, it weighed thirty-eight pounds; I told him if he would call upon

            , Addle-hill, Doctors'-Commons, he should be paid for it, but he never called to my knowledge; James Hale brought it away, and shewed it to Mr. Hale; he desired me to take care of it till the morning, and on Thursday morning Tyler was taken into custody, and Stevenson was taken up the day after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. I take it you have given a very correct account of every thing that happened? - A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I have heard a proverb, that those that hide can find; you have heard that proverb before? - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q.Stevenson was taken up two days after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was taken up at his own house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time he might have got away if he had chose? - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you went into the shop, was he in the shop? - A. He was in a little room behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.How quick were you in pursuit of the prisoner? - A. We watched him to Stevenson's house the moment he came out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he knew nothing of any iron being placed where you found it? - A. He could not, for he was not in the shop at the time it was stole.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that you believed he did not know where the iron was that Tyler had brought in? - A. No, I did not say so, I meant that I supposed the man that bought the iron did not know where it was stolen from.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes might pass from the time Tyler came out till the time you went in? - A.Not a moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there not a man in the room besides? - A. I did not see any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular that struck you in the parlour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any music? - A. No, he had a violin in his hand when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALE sworn. - I am brother to Aaron Hale; Edward Tyler came out of my brother's shop; I followed him to Grub-street, and as he was going down Wood-street, I saw the iron upon his shoulder, and when he came into Grub-street, he went into Stevenson's house; Daniel and I stood opposite the place till he came out again, and when he came out, we entered immediately, and asked for the iron that the man had brought in; Stevenson made answer, what man? I said, the man with the hairy cap, you must know who it was; then he said, do you want this iron; I said, yes, for a particular use; Stevenson immediately went behind the the counter, and put the iron upon the counter; we desired him to weigh it, it weighed thirty-eight pounds; we told him to come to Aaron

               <p>Q. And told you you were welcome to it? - A. Yes.</p>

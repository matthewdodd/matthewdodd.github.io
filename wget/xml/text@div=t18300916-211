            . I am the wife of John Thomas. On the 23rd of August I was in our parlour, and saw the prisoner come in, take these shoes from the shop-window, and put them on her feet - I came into the shop to serve her, but she was going out, without paying for them or asking the price; I said, "I think they are about your size;" she did not say a word, but was going out - I would not let her go; she insisted upon my not stopping her - she then said she had made a mistake and came out without money; she insisted upon my not taking them off.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, and the prosecutrix, with the assistance of her apprentice, and took the shoes off her feet; I asked if she had paid for them; she said, "Yes, 2s." I said I thought she had made a mistake - she looked into her pocket, and had not one farthing.</p>

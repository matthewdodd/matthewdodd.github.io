                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 47, Mark-lane—I know the prisoner—on the 28th August he was clerk to Mr. Dashwood, of 41, Eastcheap, who has a sale-room at Hackney, called St. Thomas's Hall—about 29th of August, I told the prisoner that I wished some goods sold, and if it would be anything in his way, I would employ his master, and he begged me to do so—thereupon I gave an order to Mr. Dashwood to receive the goods—I gave the order to the prisoner for Mr. Dashwood—I told him that I wanted some furniture sold, but I particularly stipulated that the contents of my drawers and my books were not to be sold by any means—the furniture was there at Taylor's Repository, Newington—it was for a ten-roomed house—there were two wardrobes, containing drawers, a peram<lb></lb>bulator, a bagfull of coins in one of the drawers, a bundle of Indian spears, a cruet-stand, two brushes, three trays, a telescope, two Indian fans, and a chest full of tools—I told the prisoner that the contents of the drawers generally were not to be touched—I afterwards saw my furniture at St. Thomas's Hall, Hackney, about the 24th August—I had seen it about four or five days before that at Newington—the drawers of the wardrobe were then</p>

               <p>locked—I had seen the 200 coins and the contents of the drawers about four days before they were removed from Taylor's Repository—I attended the sale—I examined the drawers, and found they were empty—they had been unlocked—I had not given the prisoner the keys—I was to have taken the things out of the drawers that day—I said, "The drawers have been forced open, and a great many things are missing"—he said he did not know any<lb></lb>thing about it, he had had nothing to do with it—on the day I gave him in custody, 13th December, I said to him, "Where is that whip of mine?"—he said, "I do not know what you mean, I have not seen one at all"—this was at a refreshment place in Eastcheap—on the same evening the daughter of the keeper of the refreshment-room showed me about fifty coins—they were the same coins that I had missed—I had last seen them about 24th August, at Taylor's Repository—about 30th August, I said to the prisoner, "What has become of that bundle of Indian spears, and a driving-whip?"—he said he did not know anything about them—about the middle of September, he gave me an empty tool-chest—he said that he had taken it home in case it should be lost—about 24th August, I missed my perambulator, and I asked him what had become of it—he said that it was broken all to pieces, and that it was not worth while keeping it—afterwards he said he had sold it for three shillings, which he gave me—on the evening of 13th December, I went with the officer, Head, to his house at Herne hill—we found there some Indian spears, two brushes, duplicates of two ivory fans, and a duplicate of a whip.</p>

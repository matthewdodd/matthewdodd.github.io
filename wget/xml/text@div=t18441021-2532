                  </hi> I am a weigher in the Customs—the prisoner was also a weigher. I was on duty as Custom gate-keeper at St. Katharine's Dock at No. 10 gate on the 8th of Oct., at half-past two o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner came from the inside of the dock—he had a small chest of tea with a handkerchief loosely over it—some part of the chest was visible—I asked him what he had there—he said, "A present"—I told him I could not allow him to pass with any present—Mr. Taylor, the inspector, came up—he spoke to him, and took the chest, and examined it—it contained 14lbs. 11ozs. of tea—I do not know the vessel that the prisoner had been employed on that day.</p>

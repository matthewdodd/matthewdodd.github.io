             sworn.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it? - I do not recollect exactly, it was on the time of the riot, I believe Friday or Saturday.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was you taking your dinner? - I was taking my dinner in Smithfield, in an eating house, Mr. Miller's; I was by myself in a room when three gentlemen came in; I saw one of these men two times before, in this same house there, at first one of them mentioned that he had formerly been robbed, and almost killed by kidnappers, he said so, not to me, to the man who keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these three men that came in? - I don't know, I only know one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110121"></xptr>them, I do not know his name, I saw him three or four times in the same eating house; I only know one of them, him in the blue coat, the other I do not know at all.</p>
               <p>Court. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the person? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came in what did they do? - One told that he had been robbed, and almost killed by kidnappers, some time before, he did not mention the time; and after they took a chair and dined, another mentioned a great many things, I do not recollect about kidnappers, and the gentleman in the blue coat, he took the bills out of his pocket, and the other two which was in their company said, that he had some also in his pocket, that person is not here; the young man in the blue coat, he came were I sit down, and he gave me one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the bill before.(The bill shewn him.) - It is the same exactly, I know by the direction on it, it is the bill; I received it without giving any approbation or disapprobation, and put it in my pocket without reading; after my dinner I went out of the room, and I read the paper by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave them in the room? - I left them all three in the room; I read the bill, I looked on it as nonsense, it struck me as a dangerous bill at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had read the bill what did you do? - I went to the Mansion House immediately; I called on the Lord Mayor and I gave it to him, with the direction, and he sent for these three young men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when they were brought before the Lord Mayor? - I was not.</p>
               <p>The bill read by the clerk of the court.</p>
               <p>"To the PUBLIC.</p>
               <p>Beware, Britons, of the hordes of crimps and kidnappers that infest the metropolis and its environs, who rob and imprison its peaceful inhabitants. Oh! think of the number of parents that are made wretched, in having their blooming sons torn from them by these Monsters. - Would such atrocious acts have been suffered in the days of Alfred? If you bring these Demons before the magistrates, you cannot get redress, they will screen them in defiance of the Law. Is this the Land so famed for Liberty? Did Sidney and Russel bleed for this? - Oh, My Poor Country!"</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - Between three and four.</p>
               <p>Barrow to Rusina. Pray, sir, did I give you any papers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did I sit in the room? - You was sitting opposite the gentleman who is not here, and the other gentleman was by himself; I was near the door, the gentleman in black was here, and you sat there, (pointing the manner they fat in the room) I was near the door, and another came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he was sitting in the room, Watson? - He was on the left; you left your place and went to his table.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether I sat below or opposite? - You was opposite to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what coat was I dressed in? - I do not recollect; if I saw you in the same clothes I should know you very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I in the same colour as I am at present? - No, you was almost in another colour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Miller's Cook shop in Smithfield? - I did, on the 23d of August, on Saturday, about half after three; my Lord Mayor sent me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find these gentlemen there? - I went up stairs, with two other officers, and seized Barrow, him and his papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present? - Mr. Barrow, Mr. Scott, and the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Barrow; who did you search? - I searched Mr. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find on Mr. Barrow? - These are the papers, they were presented before the grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they about? - They had pen, ink, and paper before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for Mr. Miller? Where was Mr. Miller? - He was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they done dinner? - They had, and they had pen and ink, and they all three sat about this table.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to this house? - A gentleman, a foreigner, came to my Lord Mayor, on the 23d of August, on a Saturday, and in consequence of that I was sent after them, and after I had searched them I took them to the Mansion House, and from there to the Compter, till Monday.(The paper read by the clerk of the court.)</p>
               <p>"To the worthy Citizens of London.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the militia bill, which the common council of the different wards are now carrying into effect fills you with astonishment; I am only surprised that it does not produce a very different effect: what shall such an important matter be determined upon without your being consulted, or informed that a business of so great magnitude was in agitation: shall the declaration which, with matchless affrontry, was made in parliament, that the measures was well considered, and met your approbation, when at least ninety-nine out of every hundred of you was particularly ignorant of its principles and operations. For shame! awake from your lethargy! let it not be said of you that you are strangers to that spirit which had used to animate the City of London, in the preservation of their rights and liberty. If you do not resist with spirit the present innovation of those rights, you will merit this or any other oppression that unprincipled or interested men in power may wish to impose upon you: And I shall not be surprised if, in the next session, a bill should be brought in parliament to convert your shops into barracks. There is no time to be lost! Might I advise, meetings should be immediately convened in every ward, and the common council men called upon to assign their reasons for deciding a matter of such vast importance without having applied to their constituents for instructions, or their being in the least informed of their sentiments on the subject; which, according to my opinion, is a subject which calls for the most serious considerations, the most cool and deliberate discussion. That you may see your present alarming situation in its true light, and speedily adopt such measures as may effectually avert so great an evil, is the sincere wish of an old citizen."(Another paper read by the clerk of the Court)</p>
               <p>"Soldiers! now is the time to acquire glory, protect villainy, and murder those of your fellow creatures who have the courage to resist you."</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110123"></xptr>Q. In what state were these papers? - Quite damp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That is the same that was delivered to that gentleman, of which there was a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the last that was read? - Them that we took out of the pocket of Mr. Barrow was dampish.(Alluding to the paper, No. 1.)</p>
               <p>(Another paper read by the clerk of the Court. No. 3)</p>
               <p>"To the citizens of London.</p>
               <p>Friends and fellow citizens, our torpid insensibility hath subjected us to every imposition of the crafty knaves, to whose cunning delusions we have implicitly become the dupes, it is time to rouse our attention and consideration to every thing that has not the least appearance of connection with our welfare, and no longer tacitly submit our property and persons to the direction of our court, or court sycophants whatever, which are at all times actuated by the score of interest; and while they can preserve and feather their own nests care not who wants; and I dare be careful to say, that our government is managed by rascals of this description, &amp;c. Let us at least preserve the spirit of our brave ancestors, spurn at corruption and venality; once more prove yourselves worthy of the most honourable of all names, that of citizens. Consider, therefore, that is absolutely contary to the charter of the great City of London; which is, that the said citizens shall not be sent to war without the City of London, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>N. B. Any alien or person unknown to the City of London, being employed, is in the highest degree dangerous; and we may as well have the king's butchers to protect us, as any other stranger. Remember, O, my friends! the laws! the rights! the generous plan of power delivered down from age to age, by your renowned forefathers, so dearly bought at the price of so much blood! O! let them never perish by your hands, but transmit them to your children. Do thou, great liberty, inspire our souls, and make our lives, in thy possession, happy, or our death glorious in thy just defence."</p>
               <p>(The paper shewn to Perrott.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Perrott. There is one of these letters; they were taken from Mr. Barrow's pocket? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search the other? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you proceeded to search these persons, had you any charge of felony against them? - No, I had not. In the coach they asked me what authority I had to take them? I shewed them my staff.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrow. Where did I sit when you was in the room? - Between them.</p>
               <p>Q. If you recollect that man swore before that I sat opposite to them. When you took me I asked you whether you had a warrant? you shewed me your staff, and said, here is warrant enough to knock you on the head.</p>
               <p>Perrott. I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. To Perrott. What was on the table besides paper, pen, and ink? - Nothing else; they had done dinner, and every thing cleared away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your oath, the day that Mr. Wation was committed, was you at all examined by the Lord Mayor? was you examined before my Lord? - Only as to the papers which I took.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Is your name James? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a constable belonging to the city.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of August last, tell the court and jury what you did. - About three o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Perrott came to me and said I must go immedi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110124"></xptr>ately with him. I went with Mr. Perrott and the Marshalmen to an eating house, in Smithfield, and we went to a room there; when I came in the room there were the two prisoners at the bar, and a third person, whose name was Scott; Mr. Scott was sitting on the side of the table near the door going in; Mr. Watson was sitting opposite, and Mr. Barrow next to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found on the table? - Here is a bill I have I found on the table; I searched Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing about Watson, the two letters you have in your hand? - No, I found what was on the table, a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Near unto whom was that bill? - Near to Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before him? - Not exactly before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any writing on it? - It had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ink wet or dry? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that and see if that is the bill which was near Watson. (The bill shewn him.) - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the pen and ink that was on the table? - I cannot exactly describe.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you found that bill on the table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see both sides? - Not at that time.(The bill which lay before Watson, read by the clerk of the Court.)</p>
               <p>"Soldiers! now is the time to acquire glory! protect crimping! murder those of your fellow creatures that dare resist it! fire on the friends of freedom! destroy liberty! and prepare chains for yourselves and children!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Were there any other people in this room? - There was a man and woman, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wine on the table? - Nothing to my knowledge but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him to? - I took him to my Lord Mayor and told my Lord what had happened; I had this stick of Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Watson. You searched Watson; you took no bills from him? - None, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any charge of felony on him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the chief magistrate charge you to seize these papers? - I had orders brought me to seize these gentlemen and every paper they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Watson desire you to seal these papers you found on him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did he not? - He did not, there he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to swear upon your oath that Mr. Watson did not desire you to seal up his papers? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You took this gentleman before the Lord Mayor? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In course you was examined upon what was found on him? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination upon oath on Saturday before the Lord Mayor? - There was no examination on Saturday upon oath.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place at the Mansion-house on Saturday? They were taken to prisen? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday there was examination upon oath? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was sworn? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was examined before the Lord Mayor on Monday did you tell the same story as you have now, that there were no papers found on Watson? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. However, not withstanding you then told the Lord Mayor that no papers was found on Watson, the Lord Mayor committed Watson? - He did.</p>

I wish to know if the defendant said he wished the matter settled, and that he ha sent word to you to settle it, but not to defend it; and he expected that you would pay the money, as it was a matter of your own; what could that allude to? any transaction between you and him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had a communication, not from him, but from another</p>

It could not allude to anything that passed between you and him after the note was written?—A. No. Q. Had you no transactions with him?—A. I was his solicitor up to that time. Q. Was he your creditor or debtor?—A. There was some money owing from him, I believe to me. Q. How much do you think it was?—A. The bill has not been made out. I had a partner; there was some difference between us, and we dissolved partnership; but as to the amount I know not Q. You must have some notion? A. Perhaps, my Lord, it might have been 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. connected with some mortgages. Q. Have you never told him you might possibly use his name on some occasion? A. Not to my know<lb></lb>ledge; I do not recollect that I did. Q. Do you mean to say, upon your oath, you do not know whether you ever told him or not, that you might use his name; you might some time or other have occasion? A. I remember his asking me if I had done so. Q. When was that?—A. That was early in February. Q. He asked you if you had his name?—A. He said he had heard reports of his name being used. Q. What did you tell him?—I told him it was true. Q. What did he say to that?—A. He was very much annoyed, and very angry.</p>

He has no doubt become, very properly, seriously alarmed; and it is my duty to provide the best remedy in my power; as is well known, I have appeared in several actions for Mr. Booth, and in some of them he was liable to execution; and perhaps even now, he is subject to one: however, h✗e that as it may, I have determined to come to a stand, and I wish Mr. Booth to proceed to London directly, and be with me on Monday morning next, and I will place him in such a situation, with some respectable attorney here, as to obtain redress.

In consequence of that letter I came to London, and saw Mr. Garbett, he told me that he had come to a stand still, as that letter had said, and he wished to settle things for me, to get an attorney to see myself righted—I has come up with a determination to have a lawyer, to have further protection, for I found I was going on very. wrong—and the prisoner suggested Mr. Croft, but a young friend who had come up with me, (Mr. Humphries,) wished Mr. Cooper, and he was em<lb></lb>ployed—it was not Humphrey, Garbett's clerk, but a Mr. Humphries, a doctor.

Mr. Booth never gave any authority for the appearance, and he can depose to that as well as me.

The writ on the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was served on Mr. Booth by Mr. Phillips, of Shiffnal, and Sadgrove has the original copy served; an affidavit, however, can he had up by return, from the party Mr. Booth gave it to, that it was not given for the purpose of appearance; this I will send down, but I wish to see you first; a peremptory summons should be taken out to-morrow morning to set aside the judgment; do not talk to the bearer on the general subject, only on the subject of setting aside the judgment for irregularity. Yours, truly, E. Garbett. If the bearer should miss seeing you—if a letter is dropped into the box of Miller and Harden, of King William-street, before four o'clock, or at four, I will attend any appointment."</p>

Smith, to say there was nothing of the sort against me, and he did not give it me—I did not get it.</p>

Smith had sent one letter to Mr. Horton, and one to me, and he never did—I do not know whether it was in the beginning of Nov.—it was in the winter, and it was early one morning—I breakfasted with him at his brother's at Wellington—I asked him how matters were going on with reference to the Langley estate—that was</p>

Mr. Garbett anything—if anything is owing, it is from the mortgagees—I am one of the mortgagees, but it is not owing by me more than the rest—we have had no bill, and cannot say whether anything is owing or not—I have paid him a little money for his services—I let him have money at different times—he has had a good deal of money, I understand, from Major Newcombe, who purchased the property—that is what I am alluding to—what I let him have must have been on account of his services—perhaps he might have had some at his brother's house—I do not know that he had—I let him have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. once at his own house at Wellington—that is not all—he has had money at different times—he has had money on account of his bill from Major Newcombe, and Major Newcombe has charged it against the mortgagees—I did not ask Mr. Garbett to mark my debt out of his book as paid, but he told me that it was paid, that there was a sum of money or something to be paid, when the Langley business was settled it would be accounted for—that is what I understood—he had money of Major Newcombe, and I gave him authority, along with the other mortgagees—I have visited him two or three times at his house at Blackheath, on this unpleasant business—I saw his wife there—that was after the month of Oct.—I should think I have seen him twice or three times since then—I think it was in the early part of Nov.</p>

I was always very friendly towards him—I forget whether I said I would get Mr. Booth to buy a goose for him to take to Mr. Garbett—I might have offered to let him a house—I do not doubt but I did—as these bills were settled, and I had not to pay them—I have had no comfort at home with my wife since—it will be the death of her, I think—Mr. Garbett handed me the letter of the 1st of Feb.—I got that letter for the purpose of satisfying my wife and family, and also myself—they were all very uneasy, because I knew I never had signed a bill, or accepted a bill—I received it in the country—Mr. Garbett was down in the country several times, at which times I saw him—we met on equally friendly terms—I wished him well as I do now, so as he would not make use of my name—I came up to town with respect to this £50 bill—I had sent Garbett the writ that had been sent to me about the bill, and he told me the money should be paid in three days—it had been shown to me at Wolver<lb></lb>hampton-market, by a Mr. Brown, a long time before I came up to town—I do not know whether it was in December—he told me to be cautious whe<lb></lb>ther it was my handwriting or not, and I said it was not—I told him it was not my handwriting—I repeatedly saw Garbett after that, and I might, I dare say I did, mention to him that the £50 bill had been shown to me at Wolverhampton-market—I will not say I did not—there was no other shown me at the same time—I saw the name to the bill—I believe it was drawn by Mr. Garbett—I only saw my name, and had that question put to me, whe<lb></lb>ther it was my name; and I said it was not my handwriting—I did not go up to town after that, until the writ was served on me—it was after that, and before I came to town, that the writ was served on me, which Mr. Horton advanced me the money to pay off—I suppose that writ was on a bill of exchange, purporting to be accepted by me, but I never saw the bill; and the reason Mr. Horton paid the money, was, that I had my family should not be so annoyed—I did not borrow the money of Mr. Horton to pay out the execution—Mr. Horton said that sooner than an execution should occur in my house, to distress Mr. Booth, for the sake of my credit he would pay it out of his own pocket—I do not say the he lent me the money—he never had any security—I should say he paid it out of his own pocket—if I give a man an acknowledgement for money, I owe it him—I do not know whether I owe Mr. Horton that money, or not—he has given me his advice, and he has paid the money—there was no paper drawn up at the time he lent it me—nothing of the kind—he did not lend it me in the presence of Franklin—it</p>

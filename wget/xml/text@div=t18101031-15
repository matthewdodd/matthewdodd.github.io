               <p>Q. What time of the night was it when this happened - A. On Sunday the 16th of September, between five and six o'clock, I was in my master's private room two story high, I went into the room about two o'clock, I remained there till it was quite dark, I had been reading, I could not see to read any longer. I left the room. I went out and returned home about nine o'clock the same night, I went into the room, I perceived some ink on the papers which were in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. The ink was in your master's writing-desk - A. Yes; it was a square desk, the ink was locked up in it; I left it on the table, when I returned the writing desk was gone, and the portfolio; and the ink was spilt on the papers, and on the window, and on the wainscoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the window down when you went away - A. Yes, and found it shut down when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which way must this have been gone - A. It must have been taken out of the window, because the ink was running on the window, and on the leads of the counting-house; the ink when I returned was fresh on the table, on the floor, and likewise on the wainscot and on the window.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you traced it through the outside of the window - A. Yes, the ink was fresh in every place.</p>
               <p>Q. This, you say, was about nine o'clock, was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are Mr. Atkins servant, when he is in town does he live in this house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought it was a counting house in which he does not reside - A. Sometimes he does.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into this room in which this writing desk had been left, I ask you upon your oath, did not you leave the window a part up before you went down stairs - A. No, I was particular in not leaving the window open, because the wind blew my master's papers off the table; I did not leave the window open.</p>
               <p>Q. My lord asked you what time you left the room, you said you could not see to read - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say if your sweetheart came to the window you would know his face - if any body came to the window that you knew, you would know your friend's face - A. No, not without he came close to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. But if he would come close to the window you would know his face - A. No, not my own sister. I was obliged to light a candle to get my tea by.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure you shut the window, because your master's papers were on the table - A. Yes, I am sure I shut it down.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went along with the last witness Brown; he took me into a house in Brackley-street where the prisoner and a woman was, when I saw the prisoner in bed, and his wife. I then went out and beckoned Mr. Alderman Atkins's son and another man in with me. When I saw the man was at home, there came in another officer. I searched the cupboard, and in the cupboard I found this desk, some part of it, and some part under the bed. I looked the room over and found the other things that Mr. Alderman Atkins's son said belonged to his father. This is the drawer, and this is the top and sides. I found this book; this is the lock of the desk, and two ivory pens; this is a little pocket-book, a ruler, and a wafer-stamp, these I found in different parts of the room. After I got all the things together, I handcuffed the prisoner and took him before the Lord mayor. I asked the prisoner to tell me who he had them of; he said, he wished he could.</p>
               <p>- HODGSON. I am an officer. I had information from 
               <persName id="t18101031-15-person243">Brown</persName>
             the last witness. I went to the house and found the things, part in the cupboard, part under the bed, and part under two window shutters; we found a book, two steel pens mounted with ivory; after we found these things, I asked the prisoner, he would not tell me how he came by them, he said, he durst not say where he got them.</p>

             esq. Q. I understand you have a house in Austin-friars - A. I have; No. 4.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in regard to this window, how high is it from the ground - A. It is only one story from the ground, and two from the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you had left your desk in this room - A. It is my private accompting-house, and my desk was there when I left the house. I lost the desk and a large portfolio of papers; they were both left on the table on Saturday evening, the lock of the portfolio is here, as also the key of it; the key is hung to this ring by a bit of string, It was a leather portfolio, I have had it many years, the plate was worn off it, I I am positive to it being the lock. I am perfectly satisfied that this is my desk; it was made in a particular manner, the front of the desk contained Tapp and Middleton's name, who made the desk, on a card; it was here, which was taken off, so that I am positive it is my desk. This book was in the drawer, it contained some private memorandums and labelled as such, and all the memorandums that were taken down in this book were taken out; it is ruled in the margin in this manner with some precision; I can have no doubt of it. These two pens; having written a great deal with them, and having had them a great number of years, I am very positive to their being mine. This little pocket-book I can identify; I used to carry it in my waistcoat pocket. This wafer-seal I can identify likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What is your partners' name - A. I have none at all. All these things were within this desk.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it is up one pair of stairs - A. My private accompting-house is up one pair of stairs, the back accompting-house comes close to the window; on the leads of the back accompting-house a person can throw the sash up, and they may enter at the top of the leads.</p>
               <p>Q. How high are the leads from the ground - A. Seven feet, and the top of the leads about ten. We traced it to the lamp-lighter's ladder, and we found the ink upon the lamp-lighter's ladders but who took it we could not tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an innocent man. Brown has been twice convicted in this court.</p>

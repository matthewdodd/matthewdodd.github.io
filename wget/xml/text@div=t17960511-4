               <p>ROBERT LLOYD sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an Excise officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so in February, 1794? - A. Yes; at Groombridge, near Tunbridge; on the 25th of February, about half past eleven in the morning, I was going my usual round; I had surveyed one house, and I was going to the next; I met two men with two horses in the high road, just upon the edge of Ashdown forest; the prisoner at the bar was one of them; they had got smuggling saddles with straps, and tubs, half ankers, and smuggling packages; I smelt a strong smell of liquor; they were strapped on; and when the horses came up, I said to the men, lads, I shall stop these two horses, and instantly that man at the bar fell upon me with the butt end of a loaded whip; I had not time to say a word more; he gave me two or three strokes till he knocked me down; on the top of my head I parried off two or three blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them struck you before he knocked you down? - A. I parried them off with a little stick I had in my hand; I told them when they knocked me down first, I said, lads, go along about your business, for God's sake don't keep on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say they, which of them do you mean? - A. The other man just came up.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the other man's name? - A. Edward Druid; they both kept on beating me, and I begged for God's sake they would not kill me, but that did not seem to stop them, they kept laying on, and I put my arm round my head to save my head; they seemed to aim pretty much at my head; I little thought I should have got into the same situation again that I am now in; I happened to be near a little cottage, and Ashdown halloaed out of the window, and said, what do you mean, are you murdering the man? that irritated them, and they did not give me many more strokes; one of them said, damn his eyes he has got a pistol; I had a round frock on, and they rifled my pockets and took the pistol out of my pocket, and then they gave me a few more strokes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue using you in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110055"></xptr>way after Ashdown had interfered? - A. It must be half a minute or a minute; they laid on as fast as they possibly could; they went off with their horses and left me upon the ground; I got up and went into Ashdown's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You smelt a strong smell of liquor, what liquor was it? - A. It appeared to me to be geneva, it was spirits at least; it was as much as I could do to stand when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. They administered what comfort they could to you? - A. Yes; I was bleeding both sides of my head, and my arms swelled uncommonly, so that when I got home, I could not get my shirt off without cutting the wristband; it was swelled all the way up till my coat sleeve was ready to burst; I walked home very slowly; I fainted away entirely, and did not get to bed for four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you confined to your house? A. I could not do my business for about seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any effort made in order to apprehend this man when you were recovered? - A. Yes; I went with some more officers and the supervisor; we found out his house, and he saw us coming and ran out at the back door; I saw him come out at the back door, and knew him to be the man that had assaulted me; I called to the officers, and said, that was the man; I knew him immediately that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the man, you are sure? - A. Yes; I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after you were removed from this situation to another? - A. Yes; I did not think myself safe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that he was apprehended? - A. A few days ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain to the Jury what a loaded whip is? - A. It is loaded at the end with lead.</p>
               <p>Court. A large whip, with lead at the end? - Yes; heavy enough to knock an ox down.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of condition was he in? - A. He said he was in hopes his head had not got much damage; he had kept his arm over his head on purpose to save it; nothing could be well worse than his arm was; he brought his stick with him to my house, but his arm was so swelled he could not take it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the prisoner was one of the men? - A. I do not know either of the men.</p>

             lived there; she replied, there was no such person, he lived at a distance off; I had not got a warrant in my pocket to enter the house, and I went back to the supervisor; I told him I thought he was in the house; I went back, and as I was going in at the front door, I saw the prisoner run out at the back door; we all went in pursuit of him over a gate, but he knew the fields so well, that we lost him in the woods.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was making his escape, did Lloyd see him? - A. He told me he saw him, and some of them told me to fire at him; I cannot say whether Mr. Lloyd said he was the man, but somebody did.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know when he was taken? - A. The Monday morning before this last; he was taken between Chittinstone and the parish of Ever; he lives in a wood almost; there are but two or three houses in the place.</p>

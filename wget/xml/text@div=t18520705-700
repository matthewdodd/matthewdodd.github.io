                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. King. On Thursday, 24th June, I went with his carriage to the school speeches at Harrow—when we had set down I left the carriage in the crowd of other carriages, and went with the coachman to dine at a public house—we left our livery great coats with a crest on the buttons, in the carriage, and three or four shawls of my mistress's under the cushions—it was said that there was a man about there to watch the carriages—we returned in about an hour and a half, and missed the two great coats—I then sat on the box, and while there I saw the prisoner take a shawl from the door of the carriage—it was an open carriage—he was about to place it in the breast of his coat—I jumped down, and he threw it back into the carriage and made off—I ran after him but lost him.</p>

I work for Mr. William Arnold—I was there on the speech day, near where the car<lb></lb>riages stood, but could not see them—I saw the prisoner go through the churchyard with two livery coats with light buttons on his arm—he was dressed in black—he went by the dead wall, and came back empty handed—I have seen him occasionally for the last seven years, by coming there as a haymaker.</p>

               <p>of information I received, I went next morning to the Crown at Harrow, and found the prisoner there at breakfast—I told him I should require him to accompany me to the station—he asked for what—I said on suspicion of stealing some coats—there was a female with him—I was shown into a bedroom by Maria White; where I found, among other things, these two livery feats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied up very neatly in this blue handkerchief—I also found several shawls, and articles of wearing apparel—there was also a black coat, waistcoat, trowsers, and hat, which the prisoner claimed—I gave him the bat—he said he knew nothing about the great coats—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward White, and am servant at the Crown at Harrow. There are four beds in the room where I and my husband sleep—three of them were occupied that night—I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner's bundle by the side of the bed in which he and a woman were—when I went down in the morning the prisoner was in bed—I showed the policeman all the bundles together, but could not tell whether that bundle was there—I showed him where I had seen it lying—I remember seeing the prisoner on the Speech-day, dressed in a fustian suit; which he changed about 11 or 12 o'clock to a suit of black; and in the evening I saw him again in a suit of fustian—it was a flannel jacket—I know the difference between flannel and fustian—it was the suit he has on now.</p>

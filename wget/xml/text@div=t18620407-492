I am the landlord of the Ridley Arms public-house, Kingsland—on 19th February last the prisoner came there between 3 and 4 o'clock, called for half a pint of beer, and tendered a counterfeit shilling—I told him it was had, and said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he had it in change for a half-crown—I asked him if he had any other money—he said, "No;" that was all he had left—I gave him into custody, marked the shilling, and gave it to the police-officer Luff.</p>

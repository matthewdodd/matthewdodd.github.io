               <p>Q. Were you in your mother's house on the 19th of August, the day it was broke open? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first alarmed? - Between two and three, as they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up could you distinguish where the entry had been? - Yes, it had been made by the dining parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to be affected? - The window was not up, the blind was cut in two places, and the window shutter was broke all to pieces, it had been effected by listing up the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an inside shutter, I suppose? - An inside shutter; the sash was down, but the bolt of the sash was not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. What street did the dining room look into? - Into <placeName id="t17950916-5-crimeloc23">Hereford street, Park-street, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you came down, in consequence of the alarm, in what state did you find the furniture, of the house? - I found several parcels tied up; among other things there were five silk curtains tied up, a bed, and four small inlaid boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find an enamelled box? - No, I cannot speak to that. Two silk curtains belonging to the drawing room, and two belonged to the dining parlour; they were not up, they were taken down when the family went out of town, and put up in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen them the day before? - Not to observe them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any other parts of the house? - We examined the whole of the house, and found the stable door was open, and the area door was open, that is unlocked, and the house door was unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the persons, whoever they were, that had broke in, had made their escape? - We found none in the house. There had been two or three locks picked open; the locks of two small boxes and one chest, in which they found the two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the stable communicate with the house? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you was present in the stable the next morning? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your mother's christian name -Ann.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This transaction must of course take up a considerable portion of time? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you will tell me in what manner it was usual to fasten the parlour window? - I cannot speak particularly how it was fastened that night. My mother has not long had the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that there is a kind of bolt used for keeping the shutters fast? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or your mother pay the rent of the house? - It is my mother's house; I have nothing to do with it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You was servant to Mrs. Willes at the time this matter happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the dining room was fastened that looks into Hereford-street? - The shutters shut from the top to the bottom, and then rasten by a bar which goes across the middle I went round the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160015"></xptr>house as the clock was striking eleven, to see that all was fast; they were fastened with the bar that went across, I fastened them myself in the dusk of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten it compleatly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the usual way in which they were fastened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, fastened the asp of the window? - I had positively, both sashes; In the dusk of the evening we always make it a rule to go round.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the stable? - I fastened all in the stable, between the hours of four and five, or six in the afternoon, all the three doors; the main door has three bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect particularly bolting it that evening? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive any alarm? - It might be just as the watch was going half past two; I was alarmed by some dogs in the street making a great noise; it might be about ten minutes after that I perceived a shadow of a light come in at the room door, and go all round the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your room? - On the top of the house, in a small garret. I did not notice that for some time, but presently I heard the screaking of a door, or of a man walking with screaking shoes, as it seemed to me, that alarmed me, and I got up and listened, and I heard nothing; then a light came all of a sudden, which lighted the room all over, then I got out of bed and alarmed a woman that lays in another room across a little passage; I heard no more till I came back from her, then I heard a kind of shrill voice say, don't go any further, the d-ed people were up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this voice come from? - It appeared to be on the stone stair case, as you come up the garret stairs; with that I was so frightened I had not power to speak for a few minutes; then the woman said, when I came to myself, call the watch; I immediately ran into the room and called the watch, then I called for the watchman, and he sprung his rattle, then I see the watchman turn down the area, and come into the house, then I went to the garret stairs and went and called my master; I cannot say whether I walked down stairs or tumbled down, I was so frightened. With that we searched the house, but we found no one person in it; there were some things packed up, two packages laying in the porter's half, going out of the front street door, and some in the servants hall below stairs, close to the area door; and a bed which I used to sleep on, was put into the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the bundles contained? - The bundles contained table linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Any silk curtains? - Yes; they had been packed up, having been taken down before we went out of town; there were three silk curtains in one bundle, and two damask curtains in another.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they carried to? - They were in the porter's hall, they were not there the night before; the silk curtains were packed up, but the damask curtains were not, they were laying down; the silk curtains were in a cloth, but they tied them up in another strong table cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the damask curtains silk or damask? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they the over night? - In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did you go into the stable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the stable door? - I found them all open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the stable the next morning? - Yes, between nine and ten.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing? - Yes, I have got the articles into my pocket, several trinkets.</p>


               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160016"></xptr>Q. Do you know whether or not they are the property of your mistress? - I can not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any snuff box there? - No</p>
               <p>Willis. They are only a few garnets and beads, of no sort of value, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Jones, I found them at the bottom of some steps that goes out into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the window before Mr. Willis saw it? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it together? - Yes; the sash was down, not fastlened down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fastening to the sash? - I don't think there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that you said about dusk? - I went round then and fastened all the 
shutters.</p>


               <p>Willis. There was a hasp to the sash, but it appeared to be broke, or so stiff that it could not be used.</p>
               <p>Q. To Jones Do you recollect any thing about fastening the hasp? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley, I take it for granted that you usually fasten the hasp when you go round? - The window was down, and I cannot say further.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is your usual way? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you find the iron bar? - The bar was not taken from the shutter, but the wood work was cut out, and two iron hinges broke in two, and the wood shoved out from under the bar.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make an alarm on the night of the 19th of August? - I did, near on half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your beat? - In Park-street, joining to Green street, rather better than an hundred yards from Mrs. Willis's house; the rattles seemed to me to spring from Oxford-road, and I directly went away from my beat to go to the rattles, and just as I got to the corner of Hereford street, another watchman that is not here, ran over with his light.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mrs. Willes from the corner of Hereford street? - It may be ten or twelve yards; Mr. Willes is the second door from the corner of Park-street; just as I was going to turn the corner, the prisoner at the bar was standing rather against the post, or near to it, whether he touched it or not I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that post? - The very corner of Hereford-street; after I past him I thought that he made a step to follow me,but he did not, I thought he was coming after me to follow me up to the door by his movement, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - I am; in about ten minutes after that he came to me at Mr. Willes's door, and one of the Mary-le-bone watchmen was along with him, and I said to the Mary-le-bone watchman, making an observation on Mr. Willes's house, that some of the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What pane of glass did you allude to? - It was the parlour window, the lower one.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean of Mr. Willes's house? Yes, the nearest square of glass to the front door; with that the prisoner at the bar comes up -</p>
               <p>Q. Had he come up before you made the observation? - We were looking at it when he came up, the prisoner comes up and says, d - mn me, hold your lanthorn over there, and let me look, it is impossible for any man to get in there; I made him answer and said. I don't know, they might for any thing I can tell; he then says again, I am a man of property, and perhaps of as much property as the gentleman that belongs to this house; I then made answer to him, perhaps you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160017"></xptr>may, for any thing that I know, and if you have you had better to be at home minding of it, than to be out at this late hour in the morning; after that he directly walks round the corner in Park street, he was then absent from me about ten minutes longer; he then comes back again, and comes up to the door, I set my lanthorn down at the front of the door, on the step; he then fits himself along side of it;

             le-bone watchman said, it is pretty near three o'clock; yes, says I, I believe it is; the watchman then went away, and I walked over to the other side from the street, facing Mr. Willes's door, and the clock had struck three whilst I was there standing; he said watchman, you may go and cry the hour,(he was then sitting by the side of my lantorn, at Mr. Willes's door, at that time) you may go and cry the hour, I will sit here at the door, as I am a man of property, while you are gone; and I made reply again, I do not want you to tell me my duty, if I don't know it, I will not ask you to shew it me; with that he got up and walked away, went round into Park-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him any more? - Not till he was brought back again to Mr. Willes's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this glass of the window broke? - No, it was the curtain made it appear so.</p>
               <p>Q. But you thought it was broke when you made the observation? - Yes, when we made the observation.</p>

               <p>Q. I don't know whether you were present when the prisoner was searched? - I was not</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I believe at the time the prisoner came up to you, he was pretty much intoxicated? - I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me that you did not know at the time the prisoner was not in liquor? - I cannot say whether he was or was not, for I did not take that particular notice, he might have had a little drop, but I cannot presume to say.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you are very attentive to your duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If any man had been breaking into this house you must perceive it? - I do not go near the house, no nearer than Green-street Chapel, which is rather better than an hundred yards to the front of Mr. Willes's door; the chapel is on the right hand in Park-street, and Mr. Willes's house is on the left hand of Park-street, in Hereford-street; my beat from the chapel is to come forward to Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square, and then back again up into Park-lane, and part of Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you go on your beat? - At nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you remained there until this period? - Yes</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you walk up and down on this beat? - Every hour, and every half hour.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after that the watchman said he supposed the window was broke, that this conversation passed with the prisoner? - It was; I thought he had been a servant in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had pleased to have gone away, you would not have prevented it? - He might have gone away from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If he had been in a state of complete intoxication, must not you have observed it? - she had I must have observed it, but he might have had some little.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a watchman; where is your beat? - One half in Mount-street, and one half in Park street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any rattles spring on the 19th of August, at night? - I did not, the patrol called to me, and told me that there were rattles springing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160018"></xptr>Q. Where did you go in consequence of that information? - I went along Mount-street, and made for Park-street; after I got into Park-street I see the men go along with their lanthorns very fast, and I pursued after the lanthorns, till I came into North-row, there I see a parcel of watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that at the back of Hereford-street? - It is; I asked the watchmen what was the matter? and they said there was a house broke open; after that I was making into Mr. Willes's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door of the stable? - Wide open, the door opens into Northrow; I was going into the stable to see what was the matter, I met the prisoner at the bar coming out; I am certain he is the man; as he came out of the stable he looks up to the top of the house; I see he had a pair of turned down top boots, the straps turned down, and I judged him to be a servant belonging to Mr. Willes's house, I took no more notice of him, but goes on through the stable into the house, where I see Mr. Willes with a poker in his hand, and his servant along with him; we hunted about the house, but could find nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man. the prisoner, again? - I never see him till after I came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate what you see to Mr. Willes? - I did, after a bit; the servant went and got the keys of the stable, and he said, he could not think which way the door was unlocked, and unbolted, for he found the key in the same place where he put it at five o'clock in the evening; I made answer and said, I dare say it was your fellow servant, for I met your fellow servant coming out of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of what the servant told you? - As soon as the servant told me he had no fellow servant, I went out of the house and asked the patrol where that man was, with a pair of boots on? he said, he had been black guarding there, and had gone down to Park-street; with that I immediately set out after him, and told them if I could see him I would bring him back again; I overtook him just in the middle of Grosvenor-street, as he was crossing out of Park-street; I catched him in the centre of the street, I clapped my arm on his shoulder, and I told him that he was my prisoner, for I took him on suspicion of breaking into Mr. Willes's house; he told me I had no business to collar him, for he was a gentleman of property, and he would not go back with me, I told him he should, and I kept hold of him till I met the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go back willingly or not? - Not very willingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he would not go back more than once? - Not more than once; I said I would take him back to Mr. Willes, and if he chose to set him at liberty, well and good, but I did not; I took him back only part of the way, and then delivered him up to the two patrols, and they carried him to Mr. Willes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say you were going your beat, and that extends part of Park-street, and part of Mount-street; I take it for granted that it is usual for each watchman to go their own beat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Unless on extraordinary occasions you do not go out of your beat? - We do not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after the rattles sprung that you came out of Mount-street? - I did not hear them spring, I was told they sprung.</p>
               <p>Q. But in consquence of that you went into North row? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you went into the house, and the prisoner had passed you, and you met the gentleman of the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160019"></xptr>and his servant, and you examined the house along with them, that occupied some time; now what distance was it that you met the prisoner, from the house, when you apprehended him? - I cannot say positively, I dare say it may be about an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be occupied about the house? - Nigh half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found this man only about four hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. You had bolted the outer stable door, had that a lock to it? - Yes, the outer door had a lock, and I took the key from that door, and the key of the coach-house, and laid them on a shelf in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the other keys? - I left them in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And found them in the door - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the key of the outer stable door? - On the shelf, where I laid it, in the same place</p>
               <p>Q. To Wade. Did you see any thing of Dawson that night? - I never see him till he came out of Willes's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had not given Dawson any information? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see the prisoner near the stable? - No, I never see him nearer the stable than the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen the prisoner before you see Dawson? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him in Park-street before Dawson came out? - Yes; I heard him enquire which was the way; he had gone near ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. To Dawson. You said that when you apprehended the prisoner, he was about four hundred yards from Mr. Willes's, and you then had been about half an hour about the house; from what time do you mean? - From the time that I see him till I went out after him; we had been looking about the house about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you came out of the house, before you see Wade? - Not a minute, I don't believe it was, for he stood right facing the door; I was speaking to the patrol as well as Wade, and asked them where the man was? and they said he was gone down Park-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you pursued down immediately on the information that you received from the patrol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took him? - Not above three or four minutes; he was speaking to a watchman in the street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a patrol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to this house in consequence of any alarm? - Yes; I was standing in Park-street, at the head of Mount-street; the watchman was going half past two, I heard a rattle spring, and I apprehended it was from Oxford-road; I ran along Park-street as fast as I could; I went into North-row, seeing a number of the watchman standing about the stable door; the stable door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Whole stable door? - Mr. Willes's stable door. I immediately went into the stable, which communicates with the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the stable had Dawson come up? - Dawson was up before me; he out ran me; he was the first person that I see in the house after going into the body of the house; I likewise went along with Mr. Willes and the servant, in order to search the different rooms and apartments. After I came out I see the prisoner at the bar standing at the corner of Hereford-street, in Park-street, when I went into the stable I went through the house, and came out at the area door, in Hereford-street; after com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160020"></xptr>ing out of Hereford-street I see the prisoner at the bar, standing at the post, at the corner of Hereford-street, in Park street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - William James, the other patrol. Says he, gentlemen, I think it would be more proper for you to be on your walks, than to many of you here. I made answer, that it was our duty to come to the sound of a rattle, or any cry, that we did not mean to stay any longer than such a sort of business required. My partner, James, then spoke to him; he said to him, who are you sir. who are so very inquisitive about our business: He made answer and said, that he was a man of property, and a housekeeper, and very probably he had as much to lose as that gentleman whom they had attempted to rob. I turned about and went to the patrols that belong to that ward. I did not see him again till Dawson took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more before Dawson took him? - He said an hour or half an hour was no object to him, and he would wait there to see that we all dispersed. I see no more of him till Dawson had him in custody, four or five minutes after, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Dawson delivered him into your custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him? - To Mount street watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go quietly? - Yes. He wanted to go by the way of his own house; we told him he must not, he might send for any body he wanted when he got to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on him - Nothing but a bit of chalk and a bit of twine about fifteen inches long.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The time that the prisoner gave you a bit of civil advice, was the first time that you had an opportunity of seeing him? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you disperse after this? - We did, as soon as Mr. Willes had fastened the door and windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Wade that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Wade when you first saw him? - He was at the front of the house in Hereford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner or Wade first? - I see Wade first about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any conversation between the prisoner and Wade? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not guilty of the burglary, nor do I know any thing at all of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray where did the prisoner live? - I really cannot tell you, somewhere about Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and he drinking together that evening? - We were. I was superintendant in the house this day; the landlord of the house was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what time do you recollect the prisoner came there? - The prisoner came to the house about nine, within a few minutes under or over, on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week? - I cannot recollect. He left the house about a quarter or it may be twenty minutes, I cannot be particular to a few minutes, or half an hour after one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he been occupied during the time he was in the house? What I want to know is whether, in point of fact, he had been drinking during the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160021"></xptr>he had been in the house? - He had. He expected two or three to meet him there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he was perfectly in a sober state when he left the house? - No, he was not; I cannot pretend to say he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been drinking a deal of liquor? - He and his friends had been drinking a few pots of beer; but they got some spirits in the mean time, though I did not serve it them, I got it for them, and they paid me for it. I should have thought bed would have been the best place for him.</p>

               <p>Q. What is he? - A <rs id="t17950916-5-deflabel24" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Perhaps you would think that bed was the best place for every body at that time of the morning? - Yes, it would.</p>
               <p>Q. He expected some friends to meet him there? - Yes, he had three or four friends come there about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. And they all went out together? - Yes, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of these friends? - Really I cannot tell that. I knew but one man, and he has gone into the country with a gentleman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

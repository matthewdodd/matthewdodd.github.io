Among other things at that time, I had the articles stated in the indictment. On the 22d of November, at nine at night, I went to bed; I got up the next morning a little after six, it was quite dark; when I went into the kitchen I was frightened to see the dresser quite empty; it had been full on the over night, and my tubs, that I had left full the night before, were empty, and the pan was full of muslin caps the overnight, and they were all gone, and the tub that I had seconded the things were quite empty; I went up to my husband, and said, my God, I am robbed and ruined. I called my daughter up, she came down, and then I saw the door and window open; before I went to bed I fastened the door and window; they were both secure at that time. I gave information at the police office.</p>

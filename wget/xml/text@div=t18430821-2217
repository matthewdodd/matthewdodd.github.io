                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the 7th of July, abont seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in regimentals outside the door of a public-house in Bell-lane, Walbrook—I asked if he knew where there was a pawnbroker's shop—he said he did—we walked about but could not find one—I told him I wanted to pawn my watch, as I had a long way to go—we went into the Bull's-Head public-house, and I sold my watch for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I changed one sovereign, and we had some beer—I put the other sovereign in my pocket, with two half-crowns and some shillings which I had received in change—I spent the evening with the prisoner at the Bull's-Head—I got drunk—the last time I recollect being with the prisoner was between eight and nine o'clock—next morning when I got sober I missed my money.</p>

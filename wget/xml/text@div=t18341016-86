Nearly twelve months - Mrs. Anderson paid when she thought proper - I made the bill out on the Saturday before the 25th of June, and delivered it to the prisoner - I did not know that she had paid the whole amount up to the 10th of August, when the prisoner left me - it was put into her other bills - she is no relation of mine - here is "Mrs. Anderson 1l. 12s. 10d.," on the 25th of June entered - this is his acknowledgment of it - I did not carry this 1l. to her next week's bill, because the prisoner said she wanted a separate bill - I sent a note to her for it, and the prisoner brought a verbal answer - I swear I have not been paid - I know

             - they endeavoured to compromise the matter - I said I did not wish to press the charge, I would not do him any injury, and if he were discharged, I would take him back and give him another trial - they said if I applied to the Court for my expenses it might do the prisoner a great deal of damage - I said I could not afford to lose time - they said,"We will pay you" - one of them took a sovereign and shoved it into my hand - I did not receive it for the sovereign I had lost - I did not ask for my expenses besides that sovereign - I discovered this loss on the day the prisoner left me - he was taken fourteen days afterwards - he was found in a public-house - the officer was after him several days - I complained to the officer, I think, the day after he left me - I went round to the customers, and found this out before he left me - he was saucy to me, and I was angry with him - I believe I said it was in consequence of his sauciness that I prosecuted him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I received 1l. 12s. 10d. of the prisoner in June - he said the other 1l. would be paid the following week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your husband and you have talked about this matter, and both agreed as to what he said respecting Mrs. Anderson not paying this 1l.? A. People in business are obliged to talk - what. I have stated is correct - he brought me the book with the memorandum of 1l. 12s. 10d. in it - I received the money first, and he brought the book up to me in about five minutes - the book has not been altered since the officer has had it.</p>

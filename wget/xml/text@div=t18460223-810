                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live in Red-lion-court—I have known the prisoner about four years—on the 16th of July he came and requested of me to procure the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him, to enable him to pay his rent, and he gave me the name of Michael Coney—I let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 18th of July, for which he gave me an I O U, and the same day I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which made up 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me this bill of exchange for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., purport<lb></lb>ing to be accepted by Michael Coney, and the ink was not dry when he gave it me—I bud stated I would not advance the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. unless I had some security.</p>

Coney, and the ink was not dry when I had it for the money in Olpin's house—it purports to bear date 19th of July, and it was given me on the 18th—here is Olpin's indorsement on it—the acceptor cannot write—the ink-stand and pen were on the table in Olpin's house—it was about two o'clock in the afternoon—I stepped in quite accidentally, and he said, "It is all ready," or else I did not expect it till the following day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>.

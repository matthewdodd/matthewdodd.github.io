On the 20th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went out with my wife and family, leaving nobody in the house - I locked the street door, and tried it afterwards; it was then broad day-light. I returned about half-past ten o'clock, in consequence of information, and found the street door open - the box of the lock was broken off, and the screws broken from the door-post; it was put too, but not fastened. I got a light, went up stairs, and found the things as I had left them; but two candlesticks which stood on the shelf when I went out, were moved on to a board near the door leading to the back premises - I had left them on the shelf. and had left a white metal candlestick on the table, I found that on the floor, broken in two. I picked up the box of the lock and the screws. It is my dwelling-house. It was dark when I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not you state before, that you left at six o'clock and returned at nine - A. No. I stated at Bow-street that I left at seven and returned at half-past ten. I noticed the candlesticks on the shelf when I went out.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live in White Lion-street, Chelsea. On the night in question (Easter Tuesday,) about nine o'clock, I was going to bed, but my sister called on me; I went out with her. The prosecutor is my brother-in-law. We were going to the next house to his; it was dark. I went to the prosecutor's door, and when in the street I saw a light in his up-stair room - we both went into the passage - I found the door ajar on putting my hand to it, and instantly called out, Watch! thieves! I instantly perceived the light put out, and heard a person come down stairs; I stood by the door; the prisoner came out and just passed me, but I pursued him, and was not a yard from him all the way until I caught him, and never lost sight of him. I caught hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You villian, I will follow you go where you will;" he turned round, and struck me over the head several times, and cut me in two or three places; I do not know whether he struck me with his fist or what; I clung to him and succeeded in getting him on the ground, and never let go of him; he struck me several times, and cut a hole right through my coat, and cut my shoulder. An iron crow-bar was afterwards picked up by his side, with which I suppose he must have struck me. I am certain that he is the man. I struggled with him for ten minutes before assistance came; there was no watchman near. My sister got assistance. While I was down on the ground some persons came up and kicked me dreadfully on the side, but finding assistance was coming they ran off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure that you did not lose sight of him - A. Quite sure. I was not a yard behind him.</p>

            . I live at the prosecutor's - he is my brother-in-law. I went out with him and his family between six and seven o'clock, and saw him lock the door. After that I went to Brown's house, and he came out with me about nine o'clock; I was going to a situation, and when we got by Anderson's door I saw a light in the room. Brown's account is correct. I know nothing more.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper of Chelsea. On the 20th of April, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner was brought to me; the prosecutor was covered with blood, and very weak; the blood appeared to have issued from his head, which was very much cut. I sent him to the doctor, then locked the prisoner up, and went with a candle and lantern to Anderson's house, and on entering the house found a phosphorus box about the middle of the lower room. I then went to the place where the scuffle ensued, and on the ground was a great quantity of blood. The prisoner had lost his hat and handkerchief in the scuffle; the hat and handkerchief were picked up in my presence, and he acknowledged them to be his own. I received a crowbar from Brown, and compared it with marks which were on the door-post, and it exactly fitted. The prisoner was also very bloody. In my judgement the marks on the prosecutor's door had been made with that instrument.</p>

I was coming by Hooper's-court;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030004"></xptr>some man came out and struck me - I was covered with blood; the man turned the corner. Brown caught hold of me, and thinking he might be the man who struck me I defended myself.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

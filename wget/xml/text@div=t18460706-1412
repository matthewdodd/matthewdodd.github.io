                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in Tottenham-court<lb></lb> road. The prisoner has been in my employ about three months—it was his duty to receive money from my customers on my account, and to pay it to me daily—he has never paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to him by Mrs. Stevens—the whole amount of her bill was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after I discovered he had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, I asked him if he had brought me Mr. Stevens's bill—he said he had—I said, "How much?"—he said, "Two pounds seven"—I said, "Have you never received any of that bill previously?"—He said, "No"—I told him I was positive he had, I had seen the bill with his signature to it—he said be must acknowledge he had taken it; that his wife was ill, and his family in great distress; he had had his goods seized, and he had appropriated the money—he had never paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Rogers, nor accounted for it—it was his duty to enter the sums received in a book which I have here—he was to have put "paid" in the book, and give me a check—he has not accounted in the book for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. nor for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

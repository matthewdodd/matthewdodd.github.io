            . I am in Mr. King's employ, in Hosier-lane. I know the prisoner's father by sight -I went with the officer and the prisoner to Phillip-street, Kingsland-road, on the 18th of January - I understood it to be where the prisoner lodged with his father; I saw the officer find several articles which I knew were Mr. King's - here is a tin mail-horn, a coffee-pot, and other things; we left the prisoner outside with a boy, while the officer and I went in - the prisoner told us where his father lived; we knocked at the door, and asked if a person named Kneebone lived there - we went in, and saw the prisoner's mother; I did not hear him say any thing respecting these things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were any of these produced on Friday? A. Not to my knowledge; the articles were all found on the same day, but some were taken in London and some in the County - I never sold him any thing; I cannot say when these were missed - we have so many we cannot miss any thing exactly; I know Kirk - I have seen him here; this coffee-pot was standing on my desk a few days before it was missed - we have a great many in the warehouse, but do not keep goods where this stood; I know this by the top - it is made in a particular way; I do not suppose we have sold above two dozen like it - we have a stamp for this top; it is strack up by one blow, almost all others are worked up by hand - this mail-horn has a mouth-piece stamped with a die; I did it myself - I have not sold them, nor do I know whether they have been sold; I did not say on Friday, after I left this Court, "I will nick him now- he beat us on Friday, but I will nick him on Monday;" the prisoner's father is not accustomed to come to the shop - I never saw him there; the prisoner has a brother who works for the prosecutor, and lives with his father.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to JAMES TOTTERDALL. Q. Did you see a horn in the prisoner's pocket? A. Yes, one of this description.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did you see this? A. On the 13th of January - I did not tell my master of it till the 16th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How had he the horn in his pocket? A. If was standing upright in his pocket; I saw a little bit of the top of it - I did not know he had stolen it; I did not know but he had bought it of the warehouseman, as they were about on the Saturday - when my master mentioned about the tea-pot I told him this.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PIKE. I am an officer. I went with the prisoner to his father's house - I did not know he lived there before; I found these articles, and a great many others - the prisoner said nothing at the time; he was very willing to show us the place.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I make such articles as these in my business: the prisoner was in my employ - I indicted him last Friday for some things taken from Islington; these were taken from London - he has a brother in my employ; I sell nothing at Islington - the goods are made there, and brought to Hosier-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You may have sold these articles? A. I cannot say - I have two or three shopmen, and seven apprentices; the shopmen are not here.</p>
               <p>JOHN JORDAN. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I know this horn by the mouth-piece - it is the way he makes all his; it is the general rule in his business to mark the goods - I made this coffee-pot myself, and can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many dozen of that description have you made? A. Perhaps one hundred dozen; this horn is made in the same way as all the horns he sells.</p>

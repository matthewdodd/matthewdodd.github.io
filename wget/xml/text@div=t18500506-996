                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker, in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On 7th Feb. we had a quantity of brass-tubing safe at Stratford, in a shed among the stores—I cannot swear to this produced, but I believe it to be the Company's property—I last saw it safe at the latter end of Jan., or the beginning of Feb.—I missed it in the beginning of Feb., but I cannot say what day—I know the prisoner—he was at work on the premises on 2nd Feb., and previously also.</p>

I saw the prisoner with this basket at Stratford, coming towards London—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Have you got a basket and nothing in it?"—he said he had nothing in it—he then said it was only a few things for the old woman—I said, "I know you are telling me a lie, the old woman is in Newgate now; I must see what is in it"—I went to look into the basket, and he said, "It is only old bits of brass; do not take any notice, and I will give you ten <hi rend="italic">bob"</hi>—I told him be must come with me to the station—he begged very hard that I should not take him, and on the way he escaped—I kept the basket, and found it contained 20 lbs. of brass tubing, of which this is some(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not see him again till 24th April—I knew him very well, and knew he was employed at the railway.</p>

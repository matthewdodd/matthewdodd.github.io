                  </hi>. I am the wife of Emanuel Aguilar; we live in Albany-street, Regent's-park. On Wednesday, 10th Dec, I was walking with my aunt, in Wilson-street, Finsbury, about 2 o'clock—I had my purse in my hand—the prisoner Maude rushed at me; he struck me, and tried to get my purse—I grasped it more tightly—he gave me another blow, and got the purse—he struck me so hard a blow on my arm, that I could not use my hand for three days—when he got my purse, I instantly called, "Thief!"—he went down a court, and my aunt ran after him—I ran straight on; I do not know why; it was fright, I suppose—in about two minutes Maude was brought back by a gentleman—I had in my purse a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the purse was found in Langham's pocket—I did not see him till he was brought to me by a gentleman.</p>

I was walking, with the last witness in Wilson-street, on Wednesday, 10th Dec.—I saw the prisoner Maude come up; he struck the last witness's arm—he gave her a second blow, and called out something—he ran down a court—I saw he had taken something, and I ran after him—after he had gone some way, a gentleman stopped him—I went up, and he asked if he had robbed me—I said, "No," but I begged the gentleman to hold him fast—another gentleman took Langham—I saw the purse taken out of Langham's pocket by the policeman.</p>

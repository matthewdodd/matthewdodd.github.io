                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 11). On 12th January, shortly after 11 at night, I was temporarily employed in the service of the London and Brighton Railway, on their line in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe, at the junction between the two lines—I was accompanied by a constable, named Thorne—about half-past 11, I saw two persons pass along the line from Whitepost-lane towards the junction—they stopped against a brick-pillar, and I lost sight of them, but could hear them whispering together—shortly afterwards one of the railway servants came along with a light,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010123"></xptr>
               <p>they then went down the embankment till he had passed, and then returned to the back of the pillar—at that time I was close to the pillar, and within a yard or so of the prisoner—I said to him, "What do you do here?"—he mumbled something that I could not understand—I caught hold of him, and called out to my brother constable, "Come on"—the words were scarcely out of my mouth when the prisoner said, "You b——, I will give you 'come on;' " and stabbed me in the face several times—Thorne came up close, to us, and the prisoner struck him over my shoulder, saying, "You b——, I will let you have it"—Thorne did not come to my assistance, and I called out to him, "Stab him; what are you doing of?"—I struggled with the prisoner, and received eight wounds in the face, one on my finger, and one just through the front of my hat—Thorne got hold of the prisoner on the left side, struck him with his staff, and secured him—the other man ran away immediately—I secured the prisoner—as we passed along the line towards the station the prisoner said, "You cannot hang me to<lb></lb>night for this"—we took him to the station, and he was charged—I went to a surgeon, and had my wounds dressed—during the struggle with me, when Thorne had got hold of the prisoner, I heard him throw something away with his right-hand—after he was down the prisoner said, "Are you an English<lb></lb>man?"—I said, "There is not much English about you"—he said, "No; I am Scotch"—I knew him before, but did not know it was him at the time I took him in custody, but knew him directly I got him to, the light at the station—Dr. Tilby, the divisional surgeon, dressed my wounds—I bled very much; my over-coat was covered with blood.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 245). I was with Gage on the night of 12th January, in plain clothes, on the embankment of the London and Brighton Railway, near Rotherhithe—I saw two persons go along the line from Whitepost-lane towards the junction; when they got there, I lost sight of them for a moment—I was creeping along in front of the sergeant—I heard them talking for some time, and I laid down; presently, I saw a servant coming along the line with a light; they then came down and concealed themselves behind a pillar till he went by; they then went from behind the pillar on to the line—the sergeant passed me and went up to them, and in about half a minute he called out, "Come on"—I went up to assist him, and found him and the prisoner struggling together—I did not see the other man after that: he was gone—directly I came within arm's length, I was struck with something on the nose (I did not know it was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010124"></xptr>
               <p>stab at first), which stunned me for about half a minute—it penetrated the side of the nostrils—when I recovered myself, I heard the sergeant say, "Why don't you stab him?"—before I got the first blow, the sergeant said, "He is stabbing me"—I took out my staff, got hold of the prisoner, struck him on the back of the head twice, and he fell down on his knees—he was resisting up to the time I struck him—on going to the station, I was nearly choked with blood; my mouth was full—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found a piece of candle, a small knife, and about thirteen pounce in money—about an hour afterward, I returned to the spot where the struggle took place, with a lamp, and found this screw-driver, and a cap, which the prisoner owned—going to the station, he said, "If you are Englishmen, behave as such: you can't hang me to-night for this"—he said that two or three times—the next morning, as I was taking him to the Police-court from the station-house, he asked me if my head was tore—he said, "If yours is not, mine is. I wished you had killed me; I am sick of this"—he then asked me if Wright had been hanged the morning before at Horse<lb></lb>monger-lane—I said, "Yes," and he said, "I wish it had been me, instead of him."</p>

I am divisional-surgeon of the M Division of Police, at Rotherhithe—on the night of January 12th, the two constables came to me—I found a considerable quantity of coagulated blood upon Guge's clothes and face, and blood was copiously flowing from eight punctured wounds on his face—this screw-driver is an instrument such as may have made the wounds I saw—nearly all the wounds, which I probed at the time, went to the bone—all the wounds were on the face.</p>

The 2 spoons were missing on Whitson Monday, and the next day were found in a hat-box in the cellar, broke each in two pieces. We charg'd him with taking them; one of them was brought from our house at Ponder's End, and then it was not broke.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Morley's my uncle on the Whitson Tuesday; he desired I would stay till he search'd his man's boxes, and both the spoons were found broke in a hat-box. The prisoner confess'd to my uncle upon his mentioning the spoons to him. He said he had taken nothing else, and was sorry he had taken them; I was in the warehouse with him, and ask'd him with what view he had taken them. He said, with intention to buy him a pair of silver buckles. I ask'd him how they came broke, he pretended the table spoon was bent when he found it, and the tea-spoon he broke in his pocket in bringing it from Ponder's-End. He said he took the table spoon on the Monday before Whitson Monday, and the teaspoon on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he mention breaking these in the cleaning them ?</p>
               <p>Phillibrown. Not one word.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that hat-box belong to?</p>
               <p>Phillibrown. I don't know; there was no name upon it.</p>

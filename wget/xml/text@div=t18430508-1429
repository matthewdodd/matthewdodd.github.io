                  </hi>. I live in Buttesland-street, Hoxton. On the morning of 18th of April I met the prisoner; I cannot say precisely the time; it was somewhere about four o'clock—I was in the neighbourhood of Wilmington-square—she followed me, and wanted me to go home with her—I would not, and during the conversation she took my purse from my pocket—no one else was near me—I missed it about two or three minutes after she left me—I know I had it in my pocket before I met her—it contained the money stated—I gave information to the first policeman I met—I was not sober at the time, but I knew what took place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information from a brother-constable, I took the prisoner into custody at her residence, No. 3, Spa-cottages, about half-past five o'clock—I told her what I wanted with her—she said it was a false accusation, and told me she had been in bed five hours—I said I knew that was wrong, for I saw her myself at four o'clock that morning, which I did, in Lloyd's-row—I took her to the station, and she there said she was drunk, or she should not have robbed the man.</p>

I have a purse, but I will take it to the station;" I took it in my hand, and gave it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tye, a labourer, and live at No. 8, George-yard, Golden-lane. On Saturday night, 14th of March, my husband and some of his friends came home together, about half-past ten at night—the prisoner was one of the party—they staid there till about two—some of them brought some beer, and my husband some gin—Mrs. Murary came in about two o'clock—the prisoner was sitting by the fire, on a box—he was very drunk—they had all got very drunk—I did not notice that Mrs. Murray was drunk—she brought a bottle, and asked where she could get something to drink, for a sick person—I said I did not know where she could get it—she put the bottle into her pocket, and went and sat by the prisoner's side for about ten minutes, then got up to go out—when she reached the door the prisoner followed her, saying "You have got a shilling belonging to me"—she said "I have not" he said, "You have," and gave her a blow on the shoulder, not a hard one, with his open hand, and insisted that she should not go un<lb></lb>less she gave him the shilling—she said she had not got it—he gave her another blow, not very hard, by the side of her face—they went out as far as the stairs—he said, "You must give me my shilling, or I will have your pocket"—they had a little scuffle on the stairs, and went out together—mine is a ground-floor room—the stairs are at the door—about a quarter of an hour after, I saw Murray lying on her back in the dust-hole, insensible—I helped her into the passage of the next house, gave her water, and tried to restore her—she did not speak a word—the police afterwards took her away on a stretcher.</p>

I am a surgeon of the police force—I was called in to the deceased about four in the morning—she was then dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found two marks on the left shoulder, little more than scratches—immediately under them, on raising the skin, I found a slight extravasation of blood—there was nothing dangerous in that—I found no external mark on the head, but immediately under the scalp on the bone, there was a slight mark, immediately over the right eye-brow, as from a blow—all the blood-vessels of the brain were highly congested, the cavities filled with coagulated blood—I cannot say whether that was produced by the blow over the eye—it might arise from purely natural causes without violence at all—I examined the viscera, and found marks of her being a confirmed drunkard—the liver denoted that—the other viscera was healthy—she died of a rup<lb></lb>ture of a blood-vessel or vessels—I cannot say whether that was from natural causes or violence—I should say from the two combined—a blow might hasten her death, and I will say it did—it was not entirely the cause of death, but accelerated it—it hastened it—she could not live after the outpour of blood, and that was recent.</p>

             lodged in the house; when I came home I went to my chest to take some money out; the chest stands under the window in the room where I sleep; and the key would not open it; I put my hand to the lid of the chest, and it opened directly; I am sure I had locked it on the Monday morning when I went away, and took the key in my pocket: I had left six half-guineas and two whole guineas in the chest, two watches, one was a French watch, and the other repeats the day of the month, and the moments; four pair of shoe-buckles, a pair of silver knee-buckles, three gold rings, and a pair of light blue velveteen breeches; there was one of the gold rings dropped just by the chest, that a little child picked up; I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday, the 29th of September, in an alley in Ratcliff-highway; I sent for Mr. Rogers, and he found a large pair of silver shoe-buckles in his jacket-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know those buckles to be your's? - A. Yes. Rogers also found a pocket handkerchief and a stock that I had lost. I then went with Rogers to the house where I took him from; I do not know whether the prisoner lived there, but he ran down that alley, and into that house; Mr. Rogers searched the house, and left me in charge of the prisoner. Rogers then produced to me two watches, a pair of silver knee-buckles, and an old guinea; one of mine was an old guinea, and the other a new one. He was taken to the lock-up house, and brought before the Justice on Monday; then the prisoner said, it was not upon Friday that he robbed the house, he said, it was Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what was said before the Justice taken down? - A. No; the Justice said, it was not worth while to put it down: the prisoner said, his own chest had been robbed of three hundred dollars coming home.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lodged in your house? - A. A man of the name of Shannon. The prisoner came to our house on the Wednesday, to enquire for a lodging; I knew the prisoner three or four years ago, he lodged in Brick-lane; he said he had been on board a ship, and was very ill indeed, and could not work; he sat there some time, and I asked him to have a cup of tea, and then he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. What did your family consist of? - A. A Mrs. Barrett and my little girl, they both went out with me; John Shannon went away on the Thursday night for Norway. I locked the room-door where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300029"></xptr>the chest was; I had moved the chest the day before, and it was then locked; the street-door goes with a spring-lock, and I had put the key in a place over the door, where I always put it, in case my husband or the lodgers should come home while I am out. About half past six in the evening I returned with Mrs. Barrett and the child; I found the key where I had left it, and the street-door was locked; I went up stairs, and found my chamber-door had been forced open; the first pannel was split, as if it had been wrenched; I immediately called to Mrs. Barrett to get a light, and we searched the house, but could find nobody; I looked at all the boxes that I had the keys of, and found my things all Safe; and there was a little watch hanging at the bed's head; I thought then it was all safe: I had not the key of the chest.</p>

We went past the door to the bottom of the alley, to the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes, to see if he was there, for I did not then know that that man was him, because I did not know him: we returned up the alley again, and as we walked up, he was standing in the same posture again; as soon as he saw us he ran up the same stairs again, I saw him up the fifth or sixth stair; Forbes was then coming up the alley, and I left him at the door while I went to fetch an officer; I could not find an officer, and I learned that he was gone with Mr. Forbes towards Shadwell; I did not see him again till I got near Shadwell Church; Rogers then came up, and Forbes gave charge of him.

             sworn. I am an officer; I met with the prisoner on Sunday the 29th, in Ratcliffe-highway; I took him into custody near Shadwell Church; I took him to the public house, and searched him in the presence of Forbes; I found in one of his pockets a pair of silver shoe buckles, Forbes said they were his; I asked him what marks there were; he said, one of the rings was broke; I then shewed them to him, and it was so. I found also upon him an old linen stock, which he claimed; and there was an old pocket handkerchief that he said was his; I immediately put him in a place of safety; I asked Forbes which was the house he had seen him go into; I instantly went to the house with Forbes and the other young man; there were a number of women there; I searched them, and immediately went up stairs, and turned out an old bed that was on a bedstead, and between the bed and the sacking I found a piece of old Carpeting tied up in a lump; curiousity led me to open it, and there I found this pair of breeches (producing them;) and in the pocket of the breeches were these two watches, and a pair of silver knee-buckles; and in the fob of the breeches was this guinea; I carried them down to Forbes, and he said, they were all his property except the guinea, which he said he could not say any thing to. I told the prisoner what I had found, and asked him where the remainder of the articles were, he said, there was not so much gold as you say; he said, there were only four. He said, some time ago, he had lost a great quantity of dollars when he came into this country, and that he had been very scarce of money, and that was his reason for taking it: he said it was not on Friday, it was on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Forbes. These are my buckles, I described the mark before they were shewn to me; and these are my breeches; there is my name upon the watch and upon the seal, and I have the number of the French watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Forbes.) Have you any reason to know that the prisoner expected you to go out that day? - A. No; but there is a public house opposite. I know this handkerchief and stock to be my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I knew this woman about four or five years ago; I wanted to lodge there; I was at <rs id="t17991030-36-deflabel205" type="occupation">work on board a ship</rs>

I asked her for money, and she said there was some in the chest, but it was locked. On the Thursday she was going out; I was very ill, I could not go to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300030"></xptr>work, and the child was gone to school; and the child came home, I gave the child tea, and put it to bed, and they both came home drunk at ten o'clock at night, and made a riot with their neighbours; on Friday she told me she had got a guinea and a gold ring out of the chest, and on Sunday they took me up. She is not married to that man, she is a woman of the town, she lived with me three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Forbis.) Did you ever pawn any of his cloaths? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever point out those things that he might satisfy himself? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do in your house on the Thursday? - A. No, I was not out of doors all day long on the Thursday; I was in bed before eight o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to George Burton Kent and Co., brush manufacturers, Bonner Road, Bow, and live in a house overlooking their premises in Bonner Road—there is a large yard round the factory enclosed by a wooden gate, and an outer yard enclosed by iron railings—about 11 p.m. on 11th July I was disturbed by a noise, and on looking out at the window saw a man undoing the bolt of the big wooden gate—he opened it and let two other men in—I then went downstairs and woke up Mr. Warren and Mr. Newman, who lived close by—Mr. Warren came back with me, and we got a' lantern and went into the yard, where I saw two men crouched down behind an iron tank near the factory door—I went up to them and said "What are you doing here?" and before I could say another word a third man came out of a closet and struck Warren to the ground with an intrument like a short iron bar—I stooped down to pick up something and rushed back, and a man rushed at me and knocked me against the wall, and hit me over the head with the same instrument—it ¦tunned mo for a short time, and when I recovered I saw the three men</p>

               <p>making for the wooden gate; one of them undid the bolt and opened the gate, and I rushed at them to catch them, and while two of them were getting through the iron gate the prisoner stood to defend them—they squeezed themselves through a broken bar in the gate, and as I came up to them the prisoner stood up with a knife or instrument in his hand, and struck at me and cut my hand—I struck him on the head with the lantern more than once, and he squeezed through the gate and I followed him—the railings and gate had been painted that afternoon—two hats were picked up—they went to the left and ran down Bonner Road, and I followed without losing sight of them—when I got opposite the public-house at the corner, one of the men turned round and said "If you come any further I will murder you"—I continued the pursuit, and kept them in sight until I found myself getting exhausted some little distance up Bishop's Road, which leads to the corner of Waterloo Road, where I met Field and Tyerman, to whom I made a communication—the three men were still in sight and going down Waterloo Road—I discontinued the pursuit, and Tyerman ran after them—my head was bleeding very much, and I went to the doctor's to have it dressed, and then went to the police-station, and the prisoner was brought in—I said in his presence to the constable, "I do not seem to recognise the man, but if any of those men have paint on their hands or coats they an the men I followed"—there were a number of men—we found paint on the prisoner's hands and coat of the same colour as that on my clothes, and I fancied I recognised him—he was bleeding from the head—I recognised him at Worship Street Police-court as a workman named Sparrow, who was formerly in the employment of our firm, and left in July, 1877, at which time the safe was kept in the factory near the door where the men ware crouching—I examined that door, and it was partially broken away, and had marks of an instrument upon it—my head was very badly injured.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The two men were 100 yards from me when I gave up the chase—I was nearer during the pursuit—at the station seven or eight men were shown to me—the prisoner was amongst them—I said I thought I saw the man, and I pointed out a man, but it was not the prisoner—I was then asked again by the officer, and I pointed him out—I then said "Oh, search if there is paint," and I identified the prisoner from the paint and from his clothes and general appearance—there were several with similar coats—the other man I picked out wore a similar coat—I believe he is married, but do not know his wife, or that her maiden name is Welch, but I believe it to be so—I do not know that he has a stall in Smithfield Market as a brush dealer—I believe he is engaged in the trade, but never heard that he was provided by his brother with tools to carry on his business.</p>

               <p>Victoria Park gales—Waterloo Road having only one outlet, we turned into another road and met the three men face to face—they saw us and stood still for a moment consulting, and then turned back, and on turning round the corner we saw the prisoner with his hands on the top of the wall of a timber yard, and the other men had got over—the wall is curved—we lost sight of the men only for a moment—the road is but little used—I rushed up and said "Hi! what's the matter?"—the prisoner said "They have hit me in the head"—I said "Who?"—he said "Two men who have just got oyer the wall"—he had blood on his head and no hat on—we took him further into the Bishop's Road and stood him against the workhouse wall, and a constable came up shortly after and took him to the station—he said he had been to Victoria Park for the day and had a little drop to drink, and these two men had robbed him—I saw Mr. Tilbury at the station, but did not notice paint on his clothes—he said there Was paint on, and then I saw fresh paint on his hands and clothes.</p>

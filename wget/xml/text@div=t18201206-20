On the Monday night I fastened the dining room shutters, and saw them fast on Tuesday and Wednesday; this property was there, and a coat which belonged to Rose was in the kitchen. I locked the dining room door at eleven o'clock at night, and on going into the room about eight o'clock in the morning I missed the property. The cook examined the house with me; we found the windows were thrown quite up, and a pane of glass broken - the lock had been forced.</p>

            . I slept in the house on this night. I arose about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and on looking from my window, I observed something laying on the lawn. I went out, and found the three knife cases and the maids' tea-caddies, which were in the kitchen over night. I found the hinges of the shutters wrenched off, and the windows up. I compared some marks on the shutters with some instrument, which Gibson found, and they fitted exactly. There were foot-marks on a sand walk in the shrubbery; I compared them with the prisoner's shoes, and they matched the impression - there were two nails towards the toe on the shoes, which corresponded exactly with the marks. I examined the marks on Saturday the 25th, there had been a little misling rain, but very light. I saw the shoes taken off the prisoner's feet, and have no doubt they made the marks in question.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first find the impressions - A. On the Thursday morning. When it was discovered we could trace them by the dew across the grass up to the window. The prisoner used to live about one hundred yards from the premises, but moved about a week before to Tanners-end. The footmarks could be traced near two hundred yards - they led from the house towards where he lived, and were only the marks of one person's feet.</p>

            . I am a constable; I know the prisoner. On Sunday night, about twelve o'clock, I saw him with another man, by Mr. Snell's back-wall near the road, he was standing still on a footpath; as soon as he saw me he went away. I followed him to Tottenham. I searched his cottage at Tanners-end, on Saturday the 24th, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Snell's, and found a chisel and crank - he is a labourer. I fitted the instrument to the marks on the garden-gate, they both corresponded, and the shutter appeared to have been forced open by them; they also in part corresponded with the marks on the shutters. I took the prisoner about eight o'clock on the Saturday evening. I asked him how he came by the instruments? he said he found the chisel when he was throwing up some dung for Mr. J. Whitbread, two years ago. I took his boots off, and took them to Mr. Snell's on the Monday; I compared them with the footmarks, they measured eleven inches and a half, and the marks measured the same. The marks of the nails corresponded exactly with the impressions, and I have no doubt his right shoe made the impression - the other shoe did not correspond with the marks. I think there had been much rain between Wednesday and Monday.</p>

               <p>MR. ROWLES. I observed the marks upon the gate, on Saturday, but had not noticed the gate before. I went out of the gate on the Tuesday, there were no marks then. There were two impressions of the right foot clearly, and one of the left - the left did not correspond.</p>

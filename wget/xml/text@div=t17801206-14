She put her hand round my waist and took out of my waistcoat pocket, a canvas bag, which had four guineas and an half in it. I did not miss it till two hours after.</p>
               <p>When had you seen it before? - About a quarter of an hour. After this I went down to a publick-house, one George Bacon's, with the drummer, and staid about ten minutes. We had a room to ourselves. I wanted to change half a guinea; I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse.</p>
               <p>How long was the woman with you? - About three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the woman? - Yes, I am. About two o'clock, we went back to the place where we had met with her; we told the watchman what had happened. He took us to the house of a Mr. Mason, in Crown-court, and there we found the prisoner in bed. The watchman took my bag out of her right-hand. She said she had it from her husband; she got up, and the watchman took her to the round-house.</p>

               <p>Did you see her with the prosecutor? - Yes. I knew her before. I carried them to the lodging, and we found her in bed.</p>

               <p>I lodged in Crown-court. The prosecutor came into the court and took hold of me, and said he would give me sixpence. He gave me a penny, and after that he went home with me, and would lie with me by compulsion, and when he had lain with me, he wanted me to lie with the drummer. I said I would not. He said he would have my bloody liver out. I do not know how I came by the purse; the money was sent me from my husband; I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Neither the Prosecutrix, nor Mr. Lewis, who was in company with her at the time she was robbed, could swear to the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Aldus, (a pawnbroker) produced a watch, and deposed the prisoner had pawned it with him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence said, that he had the watch left with him by a gentleman, whom he had carried in his coach to pay for his fare, from Bond-street to Whitechapel, because he could not change a guinea, and that he had took his number, and that he had let the gentleman have 16 s. besides; that he told him where he lived, that he did not know what to do to go home without his money to his master; that the gentleman not coming to him directly, he had pawned the watch with Aldus, and intended to let the gentleman go with him, and take it out of pawn when he would call for it and pay him his money again; that he went and asked one Mr. Higgingbotham first to let him have the money to go home with, before he went to pawn the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higginbotham, deposed, that he knew the prisoner to be an honest man, that the defence he had made in court, was true, so far as respected him; that he had come to him in the morning and asked him to lend him half a guinea on a watch, told him he had been carrying a gentleman, that he wanted to carry home his money to his master; that this was in the morning between four and five; that he did let him have the money and take the watch, that their house is generally up all night, that they supply the Bath, Bristol, and Gosport coaches, coming in and going out, that he redeemed it of him the next day.</p>
               <p>Seven persons were called, who gave him a very good character.</p>

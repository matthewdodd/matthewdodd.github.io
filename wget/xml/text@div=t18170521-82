               unlawfully uttering a counterfeit half-crown, he well knowing it to be false and counterfeit
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COOPER. I am a pastry-cook, and live in Beech-street, Barbican. On the <rs id="t18170521-82-cd416" type="crimeDate">6th of May</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18170521-82-off415 t18170521-82-cd416"></join>, the prisoner came to my shop, and laid out 2d.; he gave me a bad half-crown. I called Wood into the shop, and asked him who he took it of - He said of a Jew-boy. I put a mark on the half-crown (looks at one)-that is it.</p>
               <p>BARTHOLOMEW WOOD. I am a beadle. I took the prisoner; he said he took the half-crown of a Jew. I searched him and found he had no more, and let him go, and told him to send the Jew to me, and I would return the half-crown.</p>
               <p>HOWELL GODDARD. I am a beadle. I was passing by Cooper's, and saw Wood let the prisoner go. I watched him round several streets into Tenter-street. He looked round to see if he was watched, and there joined a Jew; they talked together for three or four minutes - I lost sight of them for a short time; I then saw him again and followed him into Mr. Perkins's shop - He came out in a few minutes - I went in, and from what I heard there, I went after him, and told him he had passed a bad half-crown, and brought him back to the shop. I searched him, and found two good shillings and one sixpence on him, and a watch. I asked him where he got the bad half-crown from? he said he had it of a person for whom he took the watch out of pledge. I asked him where he lived? - he said he did not know, and what his name was, he could not tell. I told him it was the second time he had tried to pass bad money, and asked him where he got the one he passed in Beech-street; he said of a Jew. Perkins's man gave me the half-crown. As we were going to the Counter, he said he received it from a boy in Wentworth-street; I produce it.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOODBURN. I am shopman to Mr. Perkins. On the 6th of May the prisoner came to our shop to redeem a watch; he gave me 15s. 6d. in silver, including the half-crown which I gave to Goddard. I am sure I gave him the same, as I had no other in the till.</p>

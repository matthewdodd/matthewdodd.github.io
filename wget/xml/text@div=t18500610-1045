               <p>half-sovereign—I gave him change and he left—I placed the half-sovereign on a shelf in the back parlour; there was no other money there—my husband came in about half an hour: I gave him the half-sovereign directly—I received it back from him either that evening or the next morning—I took it to a butter shop to show it—my husband had told me it was bad—when I came back I gave it back to my husband—on Thursday, 16th May, about six in the evening, the prisoner came again for a sixpenny bottle of ink, and he offered in payment a crown-piece—I did not recognize him at the first moment, but I came and put the bottle of ink on the counter, and when I looked at him I knew him—I rung the crown-piece on the counter—the prisoner said it was a very good one—I suspected it, and went in the back parlour—being alone I did not know what to do—at the same time my husband came in—he told the prisoner it was a bad one—the prisoner said he hoped not—my husband sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

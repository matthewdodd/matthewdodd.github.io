               <p>Had not you made a bill of parcels of this rum to the master carman, and made him debtor for it? - I delivered him a bill of parcels; I did not make him debtor in our books; I considered him as accountable, till I knew whether our servants were concerned in it; the six that went to Mr. Nixon's were rolled, the others were carried in carts; Scoles has been employed in our service two years.</p>

               <p>Do you know Wiltshire? - Very well; the cart he drove that day is No. 333; that number was not included in Scoles's account. Scoles was to take care of the puncheons, and give an account of them at night, I have only the charge of loading them.</p>

On Friday the seventh of November, he told me he should have a load for me on the next morning; my cart is No. 333. On Saturday morning, about nine o'clock, he told me to get ready, for he should have two puncheons of rum for me soon; at about eleven I loaded the two puncheons; he told me to go up Mark-lane and along Fenchurch-street; and if any body asked me where I was going, to tell them I was ordered into the Borough with them; by him I drove them from there to Mr. Smith's house, in the Borough, by his direction.</p>
               <p>Going up Mark-lane and down Fenchurch-street was very much out of the way? - Yes, but he said, I must go that way, because some of the masters would see them if I went along Thames-street; I went to Mr. Smith's-house, and unloaded one at Blue-maid-court, and the other in New-alley, in Mr. Smith's cellars; after putting them down, I went to Mr. Smith, and he gave me three guineas for Scoles, in part of payment; I gave Scoles a guinea out of the three, and kept two; Leggett was to have one, who was not there, and I the other.</p>
               <p>Did you see Scoles in the evening? - Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030042"></xptr> he met me coming over London-bridge with my cart; he said the two puncheons were missed; so we must go and have them back; he and I went together to Mr. Smith's; Mr. Smith's man said, we could not have them back, for that the puncheon's were emptied, and the casks knocked to pieces; Scoles said; he did not know what to do, the officer was waiting to take them in, and said, he must go directly back to the officer and say, he could not find them; I sent the cart home by a boy; I was so frightened I did not know what to do.</p>

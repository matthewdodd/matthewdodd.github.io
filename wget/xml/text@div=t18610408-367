                  </hi>. I have been for some years engaged as a porter and messenger—I live at 15, Exmouth-street, Hampstead-road, and am principally employed in the neighbourhood of King's Cross—I have from time to time been employed by the prisoner to go on errands, and have from time to time been for her to the office of a Mr. Young, a solicitor—I have received several letters from her, but cannot recollect the date—it is most likely I may have received letters from her about the end of January—in the middle of January she came to me at Mr. Costin's public-house, near King's-cross—I cannot exactly say what passed, as she had been there so many times to see me—I remember her making an appointment with me once for the next day—she said she had some money in Mr. Coutts' bank, sent up from Hereford, and could not get at it without a cheque—she asked me whether I would go with her next morning to endeavour to get a cheque or cheque-book—I said that I would—it was arranged that I was to meet her at the Angel at Islington, at 12 o'clock, and I met her a few doors from the Angel (I had, before that, made a communication to Mr. Costin; on the evening of the 15th when I first met her)—she said that she was going about this cheque and that she understood they were to be bought at some stationers' shops; she thought she had seen them in the windows, and would I get one for her—I said I had no objection to go with her, and said, "Mr. Costin says a cheque is not required; a piece of blank paper will do as well"—she said, "I know blank paper will not do; it must be a cheque"—we went to one or two shops—I went in and she waited outside—I could not get any at the shops—we at last went to Gray's-inn-lane—she said that there was a pawnbroker there whom she knew, who, she thought, banked at Messrs. Coutts', and most likely he would be able to give her a cheque—I stopped outside while she went in to the pawnbroker's—it was in Gray's-inn-lane—I forget his name—she stayed there about a quarter of an hour, came back and said that he did bank there some time ago, but did not now, and he had not got</p>

               <p>a blank cheque—(I afterwards pointed out that pawnbroker's to a police<lb></lb>man)—she said, "Will you go to Mr. Young's? I think he banks at Mr. Coutts', and if he has a blank cheque, he will give me one"—I knew who Mr. Young was—I went part of the way, but did not go because I thought he would not do it—I spoke to one of the porters in Gray's-inn-square, and went back and told the prisoner that the porter told me that a blank cheque was not necessary, that a piece of paper would answer the purpose—she said that she knew a piece of paper would not do; it must be a cheque—I said, "If that is the case, we cannot get the cheque"—she said that she understood that by going to Mr. Coutts', and making application in a person's name who banked there, that they would give it to you—I said, "In that case we had better go to Mr. Coutts' at once"—she said that Mr. Young had been her solicitor, which I knew, and banked there, and if I made use of his name no doubt they would give me a cheque or cheque-book—I said that I did not understand that sort of thing, but hoped that she would not get me into any trouble—she said that I could not get into any trouble by asking a simple question of that sort; and if I was asked what Mr. Young wanted it for, I was to say that he wanted a cheque, and had come out without his book—I had told her some time before that I was in trouble and had got the brokers in my house that morning for rent—she said that if she got her money she would make me a present of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to assist me—I went into Coutts' bank, asked for a cheque-book for Mr. Young, and was detained—I said a few words to Anscombe, the policeman, and he took me outside the hank, into the Strand, to see the prisoner, but could not see her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you were taken up, and taken to the police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was indicted and was to have been tried last session, but was let out on bail at the end of the session, after which I went to Mr. Mullens and gave this statement—I was not sent for; I went to him—I was not born and bred near King's cross; I was brought up in the country—I began in London a great many years ago—I have not carried on the occupation of a porter at king's-cross for a great many years, I have been servant to a gentleman—I did not go to the bank for his cheque-books—I have been a porter three or four years—I certainly never believed in my life that cheque-books were sold at stationers, but I did not know whether they were or not—I fancied I had seen them—I did not go into any pawnbrokers' shops to inquire, but I went into two or three other shops—I cannot tell you the names of them, but I can point them out—I took the policeman to one in Holborn—I did not take him to all, but I could have—I did not take him to the others because the gentleman was standing out-side, and I had not had to go in—I asked him to sell me a cheque-book—I knew it would be of no use to take the policeman there, because I thought the man would not recognise me—I only went to two shops—I know that Mr. Young was formerly solicitor to the prisoner—I did not go to him because I was not aware that they did not sell the things at the shops—he was not her solicitor at the time, but he had been—I did not go to him, because I felt sure he would not do it—I did tell the prisoner that I had been to Mr. Young and he was out—I did go to Mr. Young's door—I went tip the street—I did not knock at the door, nor did it open—I only went to the top of the stairs, and then thought it better not to ask him—I then went to the prisoner and told her that he was out—she went within about three doors of the bank with me, and on the same side of the way—I went in at two doors, before I got into the bank—the outer door was partially open, there is a policeman always standing at it—I suppose I was not in the bank five or ten minutes before I came out—I told the clerk that a lady had sent me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186104080102"></xptr>
               <p>and I said at the moment that I did not know her name, because I was confused—that was the sole reason why I did not mention her name—I did mention it outside the bank—the clerk said, "You know her name"—I was with a policeman then—I do not believe policeman said, "You know the woman's name, and I must have it"—I will not swear he did not—I said that it was Mrs. Palmer—I did not at that time know where she lived—she has not been particularly kind to me; she has never paid me for more than I did—I lay in goal a fortnight—I was not bailed till the session was over.</p>

Coutts'—my duty is both outside and inside the bank—I remember Samson being detained there; and while he was detained, I saw the prisoner waiting on the opposite side of the Strand for 4 or 5 minutes—in fact, I was looking at her at the time I was called in to Sampson—after he was detained, I went out to look for the prisoner, and she had gone—I took Samson to the station, and then went to Gray's-inn-square to see Mr. Young—on my way there, I met the prisoner in Long-acre, walking very fast towards Great Queen-street, from the direction of Coutts'—I believe she saw me because I saw her looking at me, and she crossed Long-acre immediately—I crossed over too, and said, "I beg your pardon, were you not in the Strand just now?"—she said, "No; I have not been in the Strand to-day"—I was in uniform—I allowed her to go on—on 6th March, I went; to the room where she resided, and said to her, "Well, Mrs. Palmer, I shall take you in</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Hall, who is employed in a distillery—the prisoner has lodged with us for some weeks, at 14, West-place, John's-row,</p>

               <p>City-road—on Friday, 15th February, she owed a fortnight's rent—it used to be paid weekly—she asked me to lend her a shilling on 15th Feb-ruary, saying that she was going to Coutts' bank to get a cheque cashed, and when she came back she would pay me the shilling with the rent—I lent it to her—I cannot say what time she went out—she came back, it may have been between 5 and 6 in the evening, and sent to say she wished to see me—I was engaged then, and I said when I was not engaged I would speak to her—when I saw her she said that she had had such an adventure, she had been locked up for two hours—she said, "Mr. Young, my solicitor, has given me a crossed cheque, and I sent for him to liberate me, and he was locked up too, and he sent for somebody who got me liberated"—this was on the Saturday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had some rent due which was not paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was paid—Mr. Bates paid it, the person whom the prisoner came with, as man and wife—a newspaper called my attention to this, and I got one of my lodgers to go to the bank—I was first examined at Bow-street, it may be a month or five weeks ago—I saw Coutfs' name in the paper, and it answered to the charge—the prisoner did not say "I have got to go to the bank before I can pay you"—she said, "I am going to Coutts' bank"—seeing it in the paper made me first think of Coutts'.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Gray's-inn-square—I formerly banked at Coutts', but ceased to have an account there at the latter part of last year—I know the prisoner—I have been formerly professionally engaged for her, and have had occasion to give her cheques on Messrs. Coutts' bank—I know Samson as coming on several occasions from Mrs. Palmer—I gave no authority to the prisoner or to Samson to apply at Messrs. Coutts' bank for a cheque-book or cheques in my name—I did not give her a Crossed cheque on Coutts' on 15th February, or on any bank—I was not locked up on 16th February in consequence of this cheque.</p>

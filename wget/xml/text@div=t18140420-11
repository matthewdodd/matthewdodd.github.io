On the 29th of March, I saw the prisoner White with his hand through a pane of glass in the shop window; he took a piece of silk handkerchiefs out. He broke the glass in taking the things out. I pursued him up Chancery-lane; he immediately delivered the silk handkerchiefs to Hinde. When I took hold of Hinde he let the handkerchiefs fall in the dirt in Chancery-lane, and ran behind a shop door; he was brought in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw the prisoner White with his hand through the pane of glass - A. Yes; it was day light, a little after six o'clock, and I am sure Hinde was the other person.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RUSH. On the 29th of March I was at work at Mr. Plush's, a plumber's shop. On my hearing some one run into the passage, I went out; there is a projection in the passage. I saw the prisoner White behind there; he inquired whether such a man as Smith lodged there; I told him there was no such man lodged there. Directly he saw Mr. Thomas's shopman had passed he ran the other way up Chancery-lane; I followed him into Carey-street. I enquired why he left the other lad behind; he said, he had been with nobody, he was never in the passage; he was never in Chancery-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a stable in Sherrard-place, Kensington. I live in a room over the stable—I keep the room locked, and keep the key with me—the prisoner was my servant for three months up to the 21st of Oct.—he was employed in the stable, and could get to the loft—there was no separation between the loft and the room—I missed a coat, an umbrella, and the other things stated—they were all in diffe<lb></lb>rent rent parts of the room—I saw them again three or four days after<lb></lb>wards, at Queen-square—they had been all safe previous to the prisoner coming to me, which was three months ago—I cannot say how long be<lb></lb>fore I missed them I had seen them safe—I did not want to make use of them, and I put them in a careful place, as I thought, which was in the drawers, in that room—I should imagine I saw the umbrella safe within a fortnight of my missing it, and that was the principal thing I missed—I found this shirt<lb></lb>front at the prisoner's lodging—I knew it to be mine—I know these other things are mine—they were all in that room.</p>

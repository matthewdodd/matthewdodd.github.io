I went to help with others. The fire broke through the floor where we were upon; we ran out, and just as we were going out the prisoner laid hold of my watch, and pulled it out of my pocket; he called out, Will, Will; and a man came to him to whom he gave something, but I cannot swear that it was my watch. I am sure the prisoner took it; I never found it again; it was about ten at night; but we were between two lamps; I saw his face very plain, and I never lost sight of him till I secured him.</p>

                  </hi> I keep a baker's shop in Southampton-row, Blooms<lb></lb>bury—the prisoner was in my service between eight and nine months—he had to deliver goods and to receive money for me—he never accounted to me for the money in question—I cannot say the day on which he left me, but I found after he had left that he had received this money—I never charged him with receiving it—he accounted to me about five or six o'clock in the evening for what he had received in the day—he went through the account every day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it on Saturday he settled with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, every day in the week—he was not in the habit of passing over two or three days—I think he has taken 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi> or 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi> a day—I should think the omission of this could not be referred to mistake—he left me on Sunday morning—I had given him warning on the Monday before—I think it must have been the beginning of March that he left—he called on me one Sunday evening after<lb></lb>wards, when we came from Church—I had not discovered that this 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> had been paid—I discovered it on the Tuesday following—this bill went in on the 27th Feb.—I cannot say whether it was on the 3rd or 4th of March I discovered that this money had been kept—I cannot say whether it was on Sunday the 7th of March that he called upon me—it was at nine o'clock in the evening—I told him there were several things wrong, and he must call, not knowing that this had been received—this is my signature to this deposition—my statement was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"About the 3rd or 4th instant I discovered tjat the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> specified by the witness Gorrie had been paid on the 27th Feb. the prisoner had left my service—on Sunday last, the 7th instant, I saw the prisoner at my house—he called there—it was in the even<lb></lb>ing, after I am from Church—I neither mentioned the subject of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to him nor gave him into custody."</p>

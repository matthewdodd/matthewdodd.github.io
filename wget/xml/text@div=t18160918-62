            , in Finsburysquare. We had some conversation together. After that I did not meet them again until they came to my own house; it might be a fortnight before both came together. Power asked me if I would go and have a walk with him; I told them I could not go that afternoon, and the next day, being Sunday, Pelham came, without Power; he knocked at my door, and my wife opened it; on seeing me, he asked me if Power had been then, and I told him he had not. He asked me to come, and have some beer; I told him I had no money, and he told me not to mind that. Then we went to the top of Bunhill-row, and he gave me three pots of beer, and a quartern of gin; we both drank. He asked me if I knew any houses where thieves resorted. He told me he could put me into a good thing, as well as he did Michael Power, and he had put Michael Power into a good way of living without work. He then asked me if I could get a man or two who could break a pane of glass or two in a shop-keeper's window; if I could, he would have two police officers standing on the other side of the way, who should run over and take him directly, and I need fear nothing; and if I could not get any one to do it, to do it myself, and never fear, but I might walk on, and he would take the first man that came up, and that there would be a good reward for that, and that I would have my part; that I refused. Then he asked me if I could get a man or two, who could pass bad three-shilling pieces; that he would fix a day, and he would give me three bad three-shilling pieces, and one good one; that I should walk with him, and should pick up a man, and get into conversation with him. He then asked me if I could get a man or two who would go and make shillings; he told me he had put Michael Power into a good way of living without work, and that Michael Power could make stuff that would colour a quart pot if that was all; I told him if he wanted a man, he should go to market for him; that is at Cheapside where the Irish labourers resort to early in the morning to get work; it is at the corner of King-street; the usual time is between five and six. After that we separated; a few days afterwards I met him and Power in Barbican; Pelham asked me in Power's hearing if I had made up my mind in respect to what he had been talking to me about; Michael Power said did you tell Barry anything; I did said Pelham; did you swear him first said Power; he would not swear for me said Pelham. He had asked me to swear on a newspaper, at the first public-house, at the time he first proposed about breaking the panes of glass, and I refused to swear; it was that I should keep secret whatever he told me, for

Then Power said to Pelham, you did ill; well says Pelham he does not believe what I say to be true; if you told him any thing said Power, I dare say it is all right enough. Well said Pelham, if you don't believe me, come with me to the Solicitor for the Bank, and I will make you know, that I am well known there. I went with him to the Solicitor for the Bank; we went up through Colman-street; Pelham told me it was the Solicitor to the Bank; I saw Mr. Westwood. About four or five days after that, Pelham came up to my house, and told me he wanted me to go along with

             to market to get two men; I said, I would, and we agreed to go the next morning, and we were to meet at the post of Cripplegate-buildings, at seven o'clock. The next morning Pelham came and called me; when I went down stairs, Brock and Power were waiting, and we went and had some gin together, all four. Then I wanted to go home for something I forgot, and I told them I would be back at the post, and so I was. Then it was agreed for Pelham, Power, and me to go to market; then we went to the corner of King-street, Cheapside; we were to go for two men. Then we went to King-street; Brock did not go. As we were going along, Pelham said, now Mike it won't do for me to be seen by these men at market, for I must assist the officers in taking them up. Upon that, I and Power went to market, leaving Pelham behind. Then Power said, now Barry, you speak to the men; that was when I went up to the men. When I got to the market, I saw Quin and Rourden; I fell into talk with them; it was about a quarter past seven. I asked them how work went on, and how work was; and they said, that no men had been taken off the market that day. Quin put his hod on his shoulder, and the other took up his shovel, and they said they would go home. Power desired me to walk on with the men; which I did, and he remained a little behind. I went on talking with the men, in Irish; when we got to the end of the street, Power called out Barry, I dare say these two men want a job; I dare say they do, said I; and yes, said Quin, we do indeed, we want a job very bad. We said, we should see our master, and ask him if he wanted any one; they asked us where our master lived; and I told them at the Cat at the corner of Whitecross-street; and I asked them if they knew it, and they did. We told them to come at nine o'clock. Power called after me to tell them to leave their hods behind, as they would not be wanted; and I did so, Then when the men were gone, Pelham came running up, and said, well, is all right; he was following us all the time Power said, all was right enough, and the men were to meet him at nine o'clock. Then I must go back to Brock and get some money, said Pelham, and let you go and have something to drink; where shall we go and have drink without money; said Michael Power but I know a public-house where we can have a pot of beer, and shall not be asked for the money until we have drank it, and we will sit over it. Then we went to the Cat, and met the men, and took them to the French Horn when I got there, there were

            , I, Quin, and Rourden; a pot of beer was called for, and had not been on the table ten minutes when Pelham came in, and looked at the men, and then went out, and was followed by Power; we were to take no notice of Pelham. Power came in again with his pipe alight. He said now, Barry, you know our master won't take any man into his employ unless they take an oath that they won't tell any body what they do. Then Quin turned about, and he began to tell it in Irish to Rourden; I knew Irish very well. I told Quin if that young man could not speak English, to tell him it in Irish. It appeared to me that Quin communicated it to Rourden. Upon this, they swore. Power took a bit of paper off the floor, and he crossed himself, and kissed it, and said he would tell it to no one but them who would be at work along with him; then he pushed the paper to me; I am not a Papist; Quin and Rourden I believe were; that is a kind of solemnity, the crossing, that is used as a species of oath. Power crossed himself and then laid the paper on the table, and so desired me to do the same, which I did, and pushed it to Quin and Rourden, who did the same as Power, only Rourden took it in Irish. After this, we drank the pot of beer, and agreed to meet again at one o'clock, at the bottom of whitecross-street, near Cripplegate church. We did meet there; I, Power, Quin, and Rourden. Power said, we must have some beer, and I have got a shilling, or else he said, there was a shilling coming; we will go into the Mariners, and have a pot of beer; we four went into the Mariners, and called for a pot of beer, and we were drinking it when my son came in; he had not been in either of the parties before. Pelham came in, and gave a look at the men, and beckoned my son, who followed him into the parlour. There was nobody in the tap-room but ourselves. My son, I, and Brock had been in company together before, about the setting of a copper; Brock, Pelham, and Power were together when we saw them; this was before this business of Rourden's, and before we went to Cheapside some days. Now I come back to this public-house again; my son came out of the parlour soon after, and two more pots of beer came. Some one said, nobody had got any money to pay for this beer; and the landlord said that the gentlemen in the parlour had paid for it. I had seen Brock and Pelham in the parlour, and they went out, and Power went after them. When he returned, he told my son that his master wanted him; my son went out and I asked Power what they wanted with him; he said, they only wanted him to take a room for them. After some time, my son came back and brought word that a room was taken in Cow Cross; that he told me and Power, and the two men were present. We then made an appointment with the en for them to meet us the next morning at the Red Cow in Louglane, at six o'clock. Power and the two men were to come to that appointment, and from the Red Cow we were to go to the room in Cow Cross; they said the room had been hired in Jacob's-court, Cow Cross. The next morning we met, Power, I, Quin, and Rourden were together. My son passed us as we were standing in Cloth Fair. We did not then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180054"></xptr>exactly know whether we were to go to the house. In a little time Pelham came down from towards Barbican, and beckoned Power to him; he went over, and beckoned me, and we left the men just in the street. Pelham told us that he had done a very bad thing on the evening before; he said, I took a room in Jacob's-court, Cow Cross, and it is the worst thing I could do, for I must be with the officers when they take the men, and the landlord will see me, and know me that I took the room; so he said he must he at the less of the earnest, and he said he must be at the loss of what I spent, for it does not please Brock, because it is not in the City; Brock had said that he was a City officer. While we were talking together, Brock came up from towards Smithfield with a switch in his hand; I met him in Aldersgate-street, and I asked him for something to drink, and he said he had left a shilling with the men, and he told me to go and get my part, and to tell Power to be sure to get a room in the City. Then I went back to Quin and Rourden, and we made an appointment to meet them in Moorefields at one o'clock. We met at one o'clock. Pelham, I, my son, and Power went to Augel-alley to take a room; I don't know how much was to be paid a week, but my son can tell you. We then came on with the men; we met them, and took them on to the room which had been taken; I, Power, Quin, and Rourden went into the room. We did not do any business that day; we had no files. Power went out, and left me and the men in the room, and a little while after my son came in with a white basin and brown paper; then in the course of two or three hours after, he brought in two or three pots of beer, and we sat down on the boards, and drank them. Then we went to a public-house, the George, in Beech-lane, and had two more pots of beer. The Irishmen then just drank a little of it, and then went out. Then Pelham came in, and Power asked him for a pot of beer, and he said no, I can't give you one, for I have got to go for the tools; but if you will meet me to-morrow morning at nine o'clock at the Cooper's Arms, I will. We met at nine o'clock the next morning. When Pelham came in at nine o'clock at the Cooper's Arms, he brought in a hammer and two files, and laid them on the table. Power took hold of one of the files, and said, that is a bad tool to work with; Pelham said it would do well enough. He called for a pot of beer, and we drank it, and then we agreed to meet at the corner of Golden-lene the next morning at seven o'clock. Pelham took the tools, and we met the next morning; I met Brock; Brock, Power, and Pelham were coming towards us. Pelham then called Power over to him, and took from out of his bosom the hammer and the files, and gave them to Power, and here is a pair of scissors said he, I have borrowed them from my landlady, and I suppose she will never see them again. Power and I then went off, and met the two Irishmen, and took them to the room in Angel-alley; we found them in Moorfields quarters. I don't know where Brock, Pelham, and my son went. When Power, Quin, Rourden, and I first went into the room we had nothing to do. Then Power went out, and in some time, he and my son came in, and brought a bottle with some stuff in it, a paper with like flower in it, another paper with a lump of hard stuff in it, some salt, a ball of whiting, some matches, and a candle. Then Power asked my son where was the brass; my son went and gave it him out of the cupboard, or out of his pocket, I don't know from which. Power then took the brass, and laid the broad file to it, and laid a shilling upon it, and marked it; then he cut it in straight strips, he cut out some pieces, and the Irishmen and I cut out some as well as him; then he cut them into shillings afterwards; he cut them into round things in the shape of shillings; they were square at first, and he rounded them afterwards. Power rounded them with the scissors, and then gave them to us to file, to me, Quin, and Rourden. After they were filed, then the scouring paper was used. We all of us worked with them. Then when they were all done, he looked at them all one by one, and there was some finer scouring paper; we rubbed them all over with it. I believe there was about thirty of them. After that was done, he went down to get a light for his pipe. He came up in about twenty minutes with his pipe alight in his mouth, and then he took a match, and lit the candle, and stuck it in the ashes, and then took the basin, and spilled what was in the bottle into the basin, and took a silver shilling out of his pocket, and put it into that; then he took a handkerchief and spread it over the top of the basin, and held the basin over the candle; so close as to heat the bason; the flame touched the bottom of the bason, and he held it until such time as a blue flame and smoke came up through the handkerchief; then he took the handkerchief off, and took the basin down, and stirred it up then with a bit of stick; then he put in the whole of that like flower out of the paper, and he put in some of the hard lump, which he scraped very small with a knife; then he put in some salt; then he put in some w g, and put the basin into the cupboard; while he was doing all these things, he was looking at a written direction now and then, which he had pulled out of his pocket. Then he looked at the shillings again, and sat down, and told me I don't think these will do, for they are not round enough, and it is not long since there was a good job lost by their not being even like.</p>
               <p>Q. Not being made well enough, in short - A. Yes. He said the Solicitor was very particular, and hard to please. Then my son came in, with some bread and cheese and beer for breakfast. While we were having it, he went away. Power desired us all to wash our hands, and we did. He took one of the shillings, and began to rub it with the stuff in the basin, and he told us to rub them well, and mind and rub the edges well, and we all began to do so; and then he directed us to wash them in the water that was is the brown pan; then he got a towel, and dried them; then there were two sheets of fine brown paper, and he rolled every shilling up separately by itself in the paper. Then the basin was put into the cupboard again, and we were to pass our time there until six o'clock, and not to go out. Then my son brought in word that we might go out to the George in Beech-lane, and have a pot or two of beer, and his master had told him to tell us so; and Power said he would take the shillings out in his pocket, and ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180055"></xptr>Brock and Pelham their opinion whether they would do. When we had the beer, we parted, and we were to meet the next morning at seven o'clock. I overslept myself, and Power came and called me, and when I came to the room about eight o'clock, I found Rourden and Quin there. Power told me that the shillings would not do at all, and they did not approve of them, and that they were to have some other brass from Bruck to make some good ones that would pass. Rourden said that there was another man at their lodgings, and wanted to bring him; I said we must ask the master first; but however Power said, he might bring him, but be sure to swear him, said Power, before you bring him here. First he hesitated at having the other man brought; but at last he agreed to it. Rourden went away, and was not gone long before he brought in Connell; when he came in, Power said, ask Rourden if the man was sworn; Rourden said, yes, that he 1s. Then he was desired to come and sit down among us; but there was nothing to do then. My son came in, and brought a shilling, and gave it to Power, and told him to make every thing according to that, and to be sure and not make an East Smithfield job of it; East Smithfield was the place where the good job was lost as they said. He said, you are to return that shilling again, for my master wants it for something else. Then Power and I desired the boy to go out, and get some breakfast, and he went away, and staid away a very long time; so Mike Power went out, and come in again with a pickling jar full of coffee. After breakfast the brass was cut out, but he was more particular; it was done in the same way; he did it with his own hands. I think my son brought the brass, or

            , I don't know which, Whoever brought it, Power ruled it, and cut it out. We then went and filed as we did before, and gave him the shillings to finish, and he laid them by that shilling that my son had brought to see if they were alike. Then all the process was gone through that was gone through the day before, only that the shillings were brought to the similitude of that which was brought by my son. Then in the evening Power went out.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember Connell saying any thing while you were at work - A.While we were about it, Connell said, now Barry. we are at a job which will hang us all, and I said are we, and he said yes; and I said if so, I won't do another days work at it; the men had been promised some bacon and cabbage for dinner. At this time I said I would go and see about it, and I took up one of the shillings, and said I would go and get some beer. That was only an excuse to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself knew you were perfectly safe - A. Yes; Brook and Pelham told me I should be. I made an excuse, and when I got out, I went into Fore-street, Cripplegate, and I met Brock, Pelham, Power, and my son; I went to Brock, and said Mr. Brock, what a pretty predicament you left me in, leaving me by myself, if any strange officers had come they would have taken me. Brock said, oh Barry, go back to the men, Taylor has gone to get the warrant signed; go back you Power and Barry, and stay with the men, and all shall be ready in an hour: by that he meant, that an officer should come and take the men, as soon as Mr. Taylor had got the warrant signed. I and Power then went back to the men; he went one way, and I another, and then we set the men about colouring the old ones again, to keep them employed. Then Power laid the shillings that he made last and finished, and scattered all the bits of brass, and put the parings of brass he had cut off, and some of the brass that was left, near them. All things at hand for the officers to find, some finished, and some unfinished. Rourden was there, and saw all this; but did not know what it was for. After the preparation was done, my son came in, called me out, and said my master wants you and Power to bring some dinner on table, he did not mention any name, when he said my master. Brock and Pelham having given a caution, not to name a name, but only to say master, and then we went down as for dinner, leaving Quin, Rourden, and Connell in the room colouring. When we went out of Angel-alley, I saw Brock and Taylor, facing Moor-lane on the other side, I was going to speak, but Brock lifted up his foot, as a signal for me to pass by, and I did so, and looked round and saw them go up Moor-lane. They went to take up the Irishmen; I went towards Whitecross-street. At night I met my own son and

            ; we had some victuals, and heard that the men were apprehended and the whole discovered; I believe at this time the sessions were sitting; the men were not brought to trial before another sessions. When they were tried, I came down with Power, I saw Brock and Pelham in the Old Bailey yard; Power took me and my son, and gave us a room and victuals that same evening that the men were taken up, and then we went to the George in Beech-lane as usual. We sent for Brock, and after some time, he, Pelham and another man came to us; I believe Brock's landlord; I have heard so since; the other man was Collins. Brock came over and asked Power how much beer he had, and he told him; and he put a three-shilling piece into his hand, and ordered two more pots. Then Power asked what did Taylor say to the job; and he said Taylor said it was a very good job indeed, and then Brock desired us to be seen as little together as possible, least any one should take notice, and not to go near his place. I attended at the time these men were tried. I saw all the prisoners in the yard; that was before the trial came on.</p>

               <p>DANIEL BARRY, JUNIOR. I know Michael Power; I recollect seeing him in May last; he came up to my father's one morning, when I was there, and asked my father if he had anything to do, and my father said no; he turned round to me, and asked me if I had anything to do; I told him if I had, I should not be sitting there, and he said if we came along with him towards Cheapside, he thought he could get us some work. We went with him; my father, he and I, walked until we came to the corner of Fell-street, in Wood-street; he told us to stop, for he was going up to a friends and would not be above ten minutes. In the course of ten minutes, Brock and Pelham came down, and

We came on until we came to the corner of Addle-street; that was near Silver-street, and Brock said, let us have a drop of gin, and he went into a shop in Silver-street, and as we came out we met

            , and he said, am I not to have any, and Brock gave him two-pence to go in, and get a glass. We then went towards the market, Brock, Pelham, I and my father went to the market; we came to the corner of King-street; this was about half past six in the morning, or a quarter before seven; Brock and my father went up to the market to see if there were any men there, and returned in a short time saying they were all gone away; and then Brock pointed out a door, and we all went together to the Mariners in Colman-street. We all agreed to meet again at the corner of Beech-lane, and he said, he would bring a man of the name of Jefferson, who had the job to do; the copper to set, and the rooms to white-wash; at that time that was the only job mentioned to me, but the prisoner Power and my father continued to talk in Irish which I did not understand. They said they must meet on the following morning. We then went into another public-house; all five agreed to meet at Cripplegate the next morning. We went to my father's house the next morning about six; we met Brock and Pelham standing in the court waiting for him as I suppose I did not lodge with my father. Then we all came together, and Brock said, let us have a drop of gin; Brock said take care and pick out a strong one, and Power answered leave me alone for that. I then went away about my business, but the shop not being open to which I was going in Black friars road, I came back. I met Quin, my father and Power together; Pelham and Brock were behind, and beckoned me in this manner to come to them; I went up to them, and Pelham said are they going to fetch another man; at this time I did not see Rourden; Brock said to me, here is a shilling, take it to the Mariners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told at any time by Brock to get a lodging-A. Yes; he told me to look out for a light room for him, and to have it in the City; that was the day the men were hired. I told him I could not tell what sort of room he wanted, and why could not his wife go; and he said she was at her sisters and Pelham said d-n me I will go with him, what harm is there in taking a room; Brock said very well, but let it be in the City; and Pelham went to look for a room, but could not find one in any part of the City that he took me round, and then we went along until we came to Jacob's-court, Cow Cross, and there I saw a bill up, and we went in. We saw the woman, and Pelham took the lodging; he said he was a coach painter, and lived in Holborn, and paid one shilling and sixpence earnest; in fact he lived at Mrs. Fields, in Golden-lane, he did not live in Holborn. Brock afterwards asked me if I understood making of clasps, I thought he meant lady's clasps; I told him I did not He said he would be obliged to me to go to Barratt's the brass founders, and get seven penny worth of hand sheet brass, and to mind it was nice and clear. I went and brought it to him, he looked at it and said it was too thick, and he wanted me to change it, and I told him I did not like; why did he not go himself, and then Pelham said he thought it would do, and then Power took a pair of scisors, and went into the closet of Bruck's and cut it a little way, and came out and said it would do nicely. I told Brock of having taking the room, and he said he did not think it would do as it was not in the City. I gave him the key of the lodging that was taken last; the last was in the City; I never went to the room in Cow Cross afterwards. He told me to meet him at the end of Cloth Fair about six o'clock that night or a little after; and Brock said, here is a shilling, go and you will find your father with

At last a room in Angel-alley was taken; Brock gave me three-pence to give the woman; I, Power, and my father took it, and gave it to her; I took possession. In the afternoon they sent me with a brown pan, a basin, and a bunch of matches; then I saw Quin, Rourden, my father, and Michael there; they were all up in the corner just by the fire place; I gave the things I took, to

            ; nothing particular passed then; Power said go back to Brock, and ask him if I am to have any tobacco, and I went back and Brock gave me a shilling, and I took some, and some beer. I then saw the men, they were up in the corner. The next day Brock gave me a shilling, and told me to take it to the men and get some victuals for them, and I did so. The next day I saw Quin, Rourden, Michael and my father at the room; I did not see Counell till the last day; Brock sent me to buy a quartern loaf and take it there, and then I saw Counell in the room; that was the first time I saw him; and then I saw them all making the shillings, and saw my father, Quin, Rourden, and Connell all colouring of them; and

             was cutting them out and filing them; and I said, if I had known this game what you had been up to, I would not have had anything to do with you; and Quin said what matter if we could get a little victuals, and something to drink. I went to Brock, and I told him, if I had known that, I would not have had anything to do with it, for they were making shillings; Pelham was with him at the time, and Brock was at home at his own place. Brock said hold your tongue you fool, there is plenty of money to be made at it, and I said what do you want with them, and he said if I had a hundred dozen of them finished, I could find a customer ready to take them from me directly; this was in Pelham's hearing. I forgot to tell your Lordship about the aqua-fortis, and that I was sent for some. After I got the beer, Brock took a little bottle out of his closet, and it had some stale aqua-fortis in it; as he shewed it to Pelham and said he did not think it was strong enough. Then Brock poured it into the fire place and washed the bottle out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180057"></xptr>and he said he wanted me to go of an errand or two. Then we went out, and came nearly facing of Grubb-street, in Fore-street, and Brock said, go in here and get three penny-worth of aquafortis; I did so, and he put it into a side pocket of his; He kept it, and then said, I want you to go over the way and get two penny-worth of salammoriac; that is hard white stuff; I went and brought it back to him; and then we went into the Mariners again, and had some beer. Now said Brock, go up to the place where you got me the aquafortis, and get me three penny-worth of cream of tarter; I did so. I afterwards took these things to the room. I don't know whether they were in brown paper. I saw things of that description in the room. The cream of tarter is just like flower. While this was going on between Brock and me, Pelham was writing a note, and he had a shilling just by, and he wrapped the shilling up in the note, and Brock told me to take it to Power, and he told me to say that they were not to make an East Smithfield job of it. but to make them like that. He did not say what this East Smithfield job was. He told me to take it; I did object. He said poh nonsense, there is no harm in that. I did not know that they were going to take the men, or I would not have had any thing to do with it at all. I afterwards found the men were taken up. In a day or two afterwards, when I heard the men were taken up, I went to Brock's; Pelham was there reading a book. I told them both if I had known what it was going to be, I would have had nothing to do with it. Pelham got into a wrangle about it, and he said, by the Cross of Christ if you say one word more about it; I will have you and your father hanged as high as ever Hammond was hanged. Brock said; he wished he could get Connell, the man that Rourden brought to turn King's Evidence, and then the others would be sure to swing, or else go fishing for life.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Ward of Aldersgate. I know the two prisoners Brock and Pelham. On the 30th of May last, Brock came to me, he said Mr. Taylor, I want you, and he said, I want you to go along with me. I said for what; and he said, I have got an information of some coiners at work; and I said where, and he said in Angel-alley, Moore-lane. I said how do you know it, and he said, I have it from very good authority. Then said I, as an officer, I am in duty bound to go with you. Then I said, stop Brock, before we go, we will have a search warrant from the Alderman. With that we went to the Alderman's, who was not within. Then Brock said, it is all in good time, what time do you dine; I said about one. Going down the Brittain. Pelham was leaning on a post. That was the first time I ever saw him to my knowledge. Brock was with me, and he said, well Pelham; how are they getting on; and he said, I believe it is all right. I told Brock what time I dined, and we agreed to meet in half an hour. After dinner, I was in the Britain, and saw the Alderman, and got the warrant. Brock went and made an affidavit.</p>
               <p>"The affidavit was here put in and read, and was a common information lodged with the magistrate, complaining that certain persons were coining at such a place and so forth."</p>
               <p>Witness, in Continuence. - The search warrant was signed in Brock's presence, upon his making that affidavit. We then proceeded down the Britain, down by Cripplegate Church and saw Pelham leaning on the post there. I was going along with Brock. Brock asked him how they were getting on, and he said, that there was one out. Upon his saying that, Brock said Pelham, then Taylor and I will go to the Crow, and when you see all is right. give a signal. The Crow in Moor-lane would command a view of Pelham where he then stood. With that we were passing the end of Angel-alley, and Pelham said, here is one now going in; and then we followed, and went into the house, and into the first pair room, and it happened not to be the room; there was a woman tying up radishes there. With that, a little aftercation aruse, and I told them they had better not talk there, and we went out below, and presently Pelham beckoned again, and we went into the same house again, and went up two pairs of stairs. With that we made a pause at the door, and Brock tried to look in through the key-hole, and said, he believed there was something hung over it, for he could not see through. Then we immediately entered, all three of us together, and we found Rourden, Quin, and Connell, the men that were conviced sitting on the floor; they were rubbing with white stuff, what I call colouring, pieces of metal resembling shillings; there was no furniture in the room, neither chair, nor table, nor any thing else; on seeing them, I hand-cuffed the two tall ones myself, and Brock and Pelham hand-cuffed Quin, who jumped about the room a good deal. In Connell's pocket I found a three-shilling piece, which appeared good, and I returned it. I then searched Rourden, and on him I found eight shillings lapped up, with the paper doubled over each, so that they could not rub together; they were in a waistcoat pocket which was open, and the waistcoat had not above one or two buttons, just about the centre of his body. I looked at the others that were found; they were blanks without colouring. They seemed very much alarmed, and very much agitated, and one or two spoke in English, if we could wait there was a man gone out for their dinners who had set them to work; and I said very well, and we waited a little time, and I thought it was not right to wait long, as it was a low neighbourhood where the house was. The woman of the house we saw, and she said to the men if I had known you were characters of this kind you should not have had my room. I found in the room also, a hammer, two files, a pair of scissors, a basin, Brock produced a phial of aquafortis as if he found it, and I found two bottles, in one of which there had been some I am sure. Brock had the scissors and files, and I had the basin and the hammer, and I produced them in Court before. I also produced the white stuff which was in the basin, and by the order of Mr. Powell, I destroyed it in the presence of White, the officer. The other things were kept, and Harrison has them. There are twenty seven piece of counterfeit money.</p>

There are two files, a pair of scissors, a board, some emery paper, five bad shillings, and a sixpence. I received these at Mr. Brock's lodging, in Fell-street, Cripplegate.</p>
               <p>William Taylor. Re-called. I look at those things, I believe them to be found in the room either by myself or Brock. This board is for rubbing up the edges of bad money. I can speak to having seen them in the room.</p>

             lodged in the same house; Pelham and Power lodged in the same room, and slept in the same bed. I had had a pair like these for two years; they are now missing; these so much resemble those that I miss, as to induce me to say. I believe them to be the same, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

The points of them were broken, and I believe these to be the same I borrowed. Pelham was only present when he asked me to lend him a pair. I have no doubt that these are the same.</p>

            . I live at 66, Golden Lane, in the parish of St. Lukes. I look at this hammer and these files that are produced, I have a perfect knowledge of them. I sold them all in one bargain to two persons, to Brock and Pelham. I sold the two files, first, and the hammer to the same person in about five minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell when it was you sold them - A. I think it was about two months before the time I was first called upon; I was first called before the Lord Mayor on the 5th of August; I did not know these two persons before; but I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>-BRADFIELD. I am landlord of the Three Mariners, in Fore-street, Cripplegate. I remember the three Irishmen being tried here for colouring money.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the bar, and tell me if ever you have seen either of the persons there, at your house - A. I have seen those two on the left, (Brock and Pelham,) and the tallest, (Rourden,) and shortest, (Quin,) of the Irishmen were at my house. I don't exactly remember the day of the month; it was about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; there had been four or five pots of beer, and Mr. Brock came forward out of the parlour at different times. He asked for an inkstand in the bar, and did not make any use or it. He paid for two pots of beer that the Irishmen had, and then he went into the back kitchen, and had a pint of beer there; I did not like his conduct about my wife, and I wanted to get rid of him, and I told him we charged three pence a pint for beer in there; but he paid it. Then he stepped through, and had some conversation with young Barry, who I am sure was there, and after he drank the beer, he went away, and five or ten minutes after, the Irishmen went. From these circumstances, and from his conduct, I have no doubt of his person. Pelham was backwards and forwards in the parlour, and I have no doubt of his person, though I would not swear positively.</p>
               <p>-MACDONALD. I am an Irish labourer, and I go to what we call the market to be hired of a morning; I know Rourden and Quin; Rourden came with me from Ireland, but I did not know Quin until I came to this place. I remember I used to come to the market every morning at six o'clock to look for work, and I used to meet Rourden there every morning; and I saw two men coming up to them one morning and they spoke to Rourden and Quin, and asked them if they wanted a job; they said they did, and they went away with them. Then when I heard they were in prison, I went to the house where they lodged; I did not hear they were in prison until on the morning that I missed them. When I heard they were in goal; I came here when they were to be tried, with one Griffiths with whom they had lodged, and I went into the public-house over the way with Mr. Burgess the counsellor. I afterwards saw Brock and Pelham talking with therw men that took them away from the market, at our talking together. Then I went into the public-house, and I told the counseller and Griffiths, I told him I had seen those persons talking together. Then I went out again with Griffiths to look among the people, but they could not be seen. (The witness here points out the prisoners, Power and the elier Barry, as the persons to whom be aliuded.) I then went and told Mr. Burgess that they were not there, and he told us to go and look again, and if I knew them that they would be in it. I went out about twelve o'clock, and went up the stairs of the Court house, and looking down into the yard, I saw the two men that took them away from the market talking to the other two, Brock and Pelham; they were at that time conversing together. Then I called Griffiths, in order that he might see them, and I might shew them to him, but he could not see them. I then went down, and I got very near them, and when I got within one or two yards of them, I was talking to Griffiths, and I think they heard me, for they ran out of the gate. I saw Barry and Power go one way, and I followed them as far as the end of Newgate street; I stopped there, and in a minute or two I saw Griffiths; they appear-to be watching us. Then I went after them again, and met them again in Newgate-street, and I took one this way, and the other that way; (Here the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180059"></xptr>witness uses a getare, conveying an idea, that he seized one with one hand, and the other with the other.) I said now I have you, you are the two fellows that took the two Irishmen from Cheapside market; then they said they were not, and I said they were. Then that man, Power, gave me a blow, and knocked me down, and they ran away, and I cried stop coiners; and I followed them again. The people did not know what I meant, or what I was saying. I followed, and a man that was crossing over the other side of the street stopped Barry. Then when I took him, another man came up to me and asked what call I had to that man; then I said he was one of the men that took the two Irishmen from Cheapside market, and that were tried that day at the Old Bailey, and Barry said he was not. I asked the stranger to take care of Barry, while I went to get an officer, and he said he would not, and he let him go out. Well, I took him again, and some other man came up to me, and a man asked me in Irish what was the matter; then he said tell me in Irish, and I will tell the people in English; and I told him how it was, and he told it to the man that came up, (the first stranger.) Then he took hold of him; I told them to bring him to the place where the three Irishmen were, which were here, and I said it they would not know him, then I would take his place. He was brought here into a matter room that is outside there, and the moment they saw him they said he was the man, and they thought he was come to swear against them and they would be hanged. and they began to cry.</p>

They came and asked me if I had a room to let, I told him I had, and they asked me at how much a week, and I asked them two shillings and six pence a week, and Pelham said he would only give two shillings, and he took it and gave me sixpence earnest; then I went and drank with him.

            , Re-called. These are counterfeited to resemble the current coin of this realm called shillings, in their present state. These are implements and materials such as would be used by coiners. I look at the five pieces; they have become tarnished, so as to be less fit for circulation then when produced on the former trial. I have been long used to business of this kind.</p>

I was coming home one morning, and I met with a man in my way; he asked me, did I want a job; I and Rourden were together; we told him we did; it was Barry the elder; he said to me alluding to Rourden, this young man is not long from Ireland, I said no; he said my master wants one or two men, I said very well; and he told us to go home, and leave our hods and shovels, and to meet at the Cat; we went there; we were afterwards brought in the evening to see the room where we were to work the next day. I remember Taylor coming into the room when we were taken; we were rubbing the pieces with rough paper. I look at the prisoners at the bar; I know Power; he was along with me in that room, he and two more, Barry and his son; Power was colouring those pieces and rubbing them.

Then he wanted me to apprehend the men about one o'clock; I told him I could not, and I went to Mr. Taylor, and we went to Alderman Cox, and he came in and took the evidence, and asked me if I thought it was a just thing, and I told him it was, and he gave us a warrant, and we went down, and when we went into Fore-street, we met with Pelham; he took us into the house up one pair of stairs; he said he thought that was the room, and on going into it, we found a woman tying radishes; then we went down again, and presently he came and beckoned us, and we went up into the two pair of stairs front room, and we opened the door, and there they were sitting; and we apprehended them. This is all I have to say, to assett my innocance; a great part of the evidence is perjored.</p>
               <p>Pelham's Defence. I have something of the same sort of defence to make. I watched them at different places, and Brock told me to watch them; and I saw them and watched them down in Moor Fields, and from that into Angel-alley. I wanted them to take them into custody, and he said they must get farther asistance to take them into custody. We went, and I did not know rightly where the room was; and we opened the door of the room on the first floor; at last we found the room. The evidence has proved false, that swears about the files; and the Barry's are perjured As for the publican, I never saw him; that is the time fact before God and man. I really believe Brock had some information about these people and sent me to look after them.</p>
               <p>Power's Defence. That Quin never saw my face, until he saw me in King-street; and I was employed in the same business that he was.</p>

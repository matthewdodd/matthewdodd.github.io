I am an innkeeper, of Teddington, near Lynn in Norfolk—in September, 1578, I saw an advertisement in the Stamford Mercury, in consequence of which I applied by letter to Buer, of 19, London Bridge Station Approach, asking for a loan of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I received a form in reply—I filled it up, and sent it back with a Post-office order for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not asked for any security—I then received a letter from then stating that as I lived so far away they should require 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for travelling expenses, for their representative to come down and see my place—I sent that amount on the 2nd October to the same address—a man came down when I was busy in the yard; it was neither of the defendants—he said "Are you Mr. Stibbon?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am from Mr. Buer"—I said "Oh I all right, come in the house"—he said "Don't say nothing we don't want anybody to know our business," and I asked him into my private room—he said "Is this furniture yours?"—I said "Yes, everything about the place"—he gave me a paper to sign to prove to Mr. Buer that he had been, and he took the paper away with him, and said I should have the money—on the following Tuesday morning I wrote to Mr. Buer, and received a reply about a week after—that is burnt—the letter said the matter was being investigated, or was in the hands of their lawyer—I then received another letter from them requiring two sureties for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I wrote and told them what I thought of the matter—I cannot say whether I asked for my money back, but I never received it—I have lost the letters in moving, having had three houses in 18 months, but I have entered in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) all that I spent last year and all I took.</p>

I took my son's answer to Kelly's and put it into the letter box—I went again in three or four days in answer to a letter saying they wanted another security besides my son—I said it was not an easy matter to find people to put their hand to paper, and therefore they could not grant me the loan—I asked Kelly for my money back, and he said it had been eaten up in expenses; and I said "Give me a' part," and he said he would give me a statement, and the next day I saw the prosecution in the paper.</p>

               <p>Court. How many stories are there in the house? - Two stories; there is the lower rooms, one pair of stairs, and garret; I secured the woman, and they all rushed up stairs; I and the woman went up stairs into the garret, and saw the man almost naked in the garret, with only his flannel waistcoat and his breeches on; he at that time was not subdued, but was in the act of resistance; I assisted, and handcuffed him myself; the first thing I saw after that, was a furnace lighted with a charcoal fire in this fore-garret; and this pot was on the fire, which I took off; the contents is in it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What else did you find there? - I found every thing necessary for two pair of flasks; the frames, boards, and screws; all these things were found in the garret, besides scouring-paper, cork, charcoal, files, old crucibles, a pair of seales, about an ounce weight of this metal, which I am informed is silver, at least, some of it; I searched the woman at the bar; and while I was searching her right hand pocket, I saw her put her hand into her left hand pocket; and I saw these two six-pences drop; in her right hand pocket I found these two other six-pences; after that, I went down stairs with the man; and a coat lay on the bed; and I asked if it belonged to him? he said it did; I searched the right hand pocket, and I found this silver, two shillings, and seven six-pences, and some silver or metal; he put the coat on, and went away in it before the magistrate: in the back window of the back room below stairs, lay these four base shillings, and seven six-pences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How many stories are there in the house? - There are two cellars, two lower rooms above the cellars, even with the street, two rooms up one pair of stairs, and two garrets.</p>
               <p>I observe, Mr. Fletcher, that the information was granted in the name of Johnson; she was the woman that knocked at the door; do you know that woman for any long time? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Do you know her by any other name; for I observe that her name in the warrant is on an erasure; was not the information given in the name of Williams? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that her husband was in custody for a felony? - I do not know she has a husband.</p>
               <p>I mean the man she cohabits with, by the name of Williams, is in custody for a felony? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was in custody for stealing a weight, and uttering base money? - I do not know the charge.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Williams and the woman that went with you to the house, occupied the garret which you have searched? - I do not.</p>
               <p>That, however, was the woman who gave you the information? - It was.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the woman, she was looking out of the window; afterwards you describe her as being on the stairs; she had not time to do anything in the mean time? - No, nothing else but to go up stairs and down again.</p>

               <p>What was he in custody for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What, had you so little curiosity, that travelled with him from Barking to London, and yet never asked him why he was in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>You really do not know what he was in custody for? - No; I heard somebody say he was in for nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Who had you your order from? - Justice Staples.</p>
               <p>Do you or do you not know that Williams and this woman that gave the information, occupied the very garret you have been searching, till he had the good fortune to get into Barking gaol? - No.</p>

               <p>I went in company with Fletcher, West, and my brother, to this house; I found there these particulars (produced): I found some money likewise in the room, and put it in this purse.</p>
               <p>In which room did you find it? - In the room where the prisoner was in, in the garret; I found it up by the side of the wall, just by where the flasks and things lay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know Williams, the man you have fetched from Barking gaol this morning? - I never saw him till we fetched him from Barking.</p>
               <p>He is to be discharged if these people are convicted, I suppose? - Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Was desired by the court to explain what the things found in the possession of the prisoners were; and accordingly describes the whole process, he sets the frames, for the inspection of the court; and shews which is called a mould, and the channel in it, which is called the get.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the crucible to melt in? - The metal in it was for the purpose of re-melting.</p>
               <p>What are these other things? - Here is other flasks, and other metal; here is some appears to be silver; at least, it is of a good composition; and some blanched copper, and something to blanch it with, corks, scouring-paper, files, shears, and a piece of a warming-pan; there is no sand here, but only the faceing; here is every thing compleat for casting; here are some coins made use of for paterns; the white stuff in the window appears to be wrought arsenic; by melting down copper with this, and it being fluxed together, gives it the first degree of whiteness; these which came from the garret, are a quantity of bad shillings and six-pences; here are some just cut from the get; they have got their roughness; these two parcels found on the woman, are counterfeits; these other parcels appear to have been fit for circulation; but they have got too bad since; but I think they have all been in circulation; those found on the man, do not appear to have been in circulation, especially one; this other parcel are some bought up by jews, ready to melt down, to cast again; these in the pocket are in a fit state of circulation.</p>
               <p>(Handed to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing all that process you have been talking of, would the effect be to make such things as you have in your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was in the court while the other witnesses were examined; you attended to the manner they gave their evidence? - I did in some part.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090054"></xptr>You heard the witness describe he found the flasks without the board, and without the screws; I take it for granted, it is perfectly clear that these six-pences could not have been made in the present state of the flask? - No.</p>
               <p>In the then state of these cut off from all spray and get, it is impossible they could have run in the sand at that time; the mould was not in a state for running? - That could not be, for they must make a side before they can make a mould compleat; in all probability, that spray was laid all down the sand; that may be half a mould, they cannot take these six-pences out till they have laid the mould upside down.</p>
               <p>Of this, Mr. Clarke, we can have no doubt, of the sand and six-pences laying together in irons and flasks; that it is so; but then it was not in a state for using, without first taking out the get and the six-pences; it was impossible to use it in the state it was in? - Most assuredly so.</p>
               <p>You have stated that the fusion of base-metal with wrought arsenick, will produce one degree of blanching; when that is done, it is still necessary to make use of something else to draw out the colour; there is no aquafortis here to day, Mr. Clarke? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>So, that in the present state of these things, he could not with them impose upon you or me a piece of base-metal, without the assistance of something else? - No.</p>

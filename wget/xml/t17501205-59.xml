            . On Saturday, the 17th of last month, I and another man went into the Shovel alehouse, East Smithfield ; in came Dawson dressed very well; I said to him, you look pretty tight, &amp;c. he told me he had got four guineas and a half of a man, and he kept four guineas of it to himself, dividing the other half guinea among his apprentices. A young man of my acquaintance, who was with me, wanted a watch ; I asked him if he had ever a one; the prisoner said he had one in pawn for 30 s. and that I should have it for six more; he said he did not pawn it himself, but a young woman did, whom I will send to fetch it out ; I was to meet him at the Swan in Swan alley about four o'clock; I spoke to two or three more men, and we went together to the Swan thinking to apprehend him, but he was gone; the next day I heard he was taken.</p>

            . Dawson, I, and Little Will, committed this robbery; Dawson and I were drinking at the Portland's prize, about seven oclock on the 11th of November, we went to Little Will's lodgings, he ask'd us where we were going, we told him upon the Scamp; we went all three together, and met the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Little Will know the meaning of that word?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. Yes, he did better than I did; we went towards Stepney Fields, it was a very thick hazey night; at a rope-walk hard by Stepney, we saw a man dress'd well, we followed him, he ask'd us the way to Rag Fair; Dawson said to him, follow us, we are going there: we carried him a back way, and at a corner when we got out of the rope-walk, the gentleman said, it was too dirty for him; said Dawson, Why don't you stop him? then I laid hold of him, and said, stand: I was behind him, and the other two were before him: the two prisoners took hold of him directly ; after Dawson had taken away his cane with a china head, I search'd him, we took from him three or four half crowns; the cane was sold in Jews-court, it was a very large one; I took from him some pocket pieces, a bunch of keys, with a seal on them, and some buttons capt with silver; we took his hat, coat and handkerchief, it was a white coat lined with coarse Blew ; the same was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050030"></xptr> produced by the pawnbroker, which the prosecutor deposed to) I carried the coat and hat, Dawson had the money, and Little Will came running along side us ; he had hold of the prosecutor at the time. I said, I'd knock him down if he made any resistance: we came to the Portland's Prize, and shared what Dawson pleased to pull out for us; the coat and hat were given to that woman, ( the prisoner at the bar, Dawson's wife) and she said she would go and pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she been his wife?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. I do not know that; the next day we were at the Portland's Prize, when she came in and said, she had pawned the coat for two shillings and the hat for one.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of the money had Little Will?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. He had half a crown, we had each the same.</p>

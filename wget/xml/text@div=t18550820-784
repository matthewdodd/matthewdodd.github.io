                  </hi>. I am a beer shop keeper, of Canal-road, Kingsland-road. I know both the prisoners—they came on Monday night, 16th July, at a little before 12 o'clock—the house was closed, but they forced their way in—they called for a light for a pipe, and some beer, which I supplied; and when it was 12 o'clock, I told them to drink their beer and go—they threw down a sixpence, but I told them to take it up again—I went round the bar to clear the house, and Teehan struck me a violent blow on the nose with his right hand, and on the arm also—I fell down, and they both kept on <hi rend="italic">punching</hi> me, got hold of my hair, and kept knocking my head on the ground—they then both ran out, and I missed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, from my trowsers pocket—I believe there were two half sovereigns—the money was safe immediately before they came in, because I had both my hands in my trowsers pockets—Teehan was afterwards brought back, and I recognised him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker of Hoxton. I was at Mr. Whit<lb></lb>comb's when the prisoners came in; they called for a pint of beer and a light, which was given to them; they drank part of the beer, and Mr. Whit<lb></lb>comb asked them to leave the house as he wanted to close it, and told me to go and open the door for them, which I did—he told them to make haste and drink the beer and leave the premises, as it was after the time—he asked them a second time to leave; they said, "What do you mean by asking us to leave when we have only been in a few minutes? d—n your eyes, you want to start us when we have hot been in many minutes"—Mr. Whitcomb said, "You had better go; you have not come for any good purpose, coming so late;" and Teehan struck him on the mouth, knocked him down, and they both fell on him—I ran up the street, returned in three minutes, and they were still knocking him about—they ran away, and he complained of having lost his bag of money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

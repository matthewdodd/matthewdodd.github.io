             sworn. I am an officer; this day week I was applied to by Mr. Clark, I found the prisoner at the bar at the White-Horse, I found these boots in his possession; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what his real name was? - A. No; there were three pair of boots in the bag, he had the bag between his knees when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor) Which of these boots did the prisoner receiver of you? - A. These are the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. The shoes you have not seen since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the boots? - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I will inform you as brief as possible; I have been in business myself; I have a wife and seven small children; about last July my trade fell off, I applied to some gentlemen to get me a place in the Wet Docks, Mr. Whittle the merchant, recommended me, there they said I was too old for Wapping Dock; I went to the West India Docks, there I worked till I got a jam between the sugar hogsheads, by which means I was unable to work, my family was in great distress; I had always maintained my family without ever applying to a parish or any person to assist me; when I recovered I went to the Dock again, and when I came home my wife was taken ill of a fever, and I was likewise taken very ill last Christmas, when my wife and my children were obliged to go to the workhouse, my goods were seized for the rent that I owed, I was drove to the pit of distress; after recovering from my illness, which was the month before this, I called upon Mr. Clark for work; my wife and children being in the workhouse, and the parish officers threatening they would have me apprehended, was the reason of my changing my name, as I understood they offered a reward to find me out; Mr. Clark gave me work himself, and when I got into Sun-street, I gave the boy six-pence to get me half an ounce of tobacco, I waited for the boy while he went into the shop; a person whom I knew came up to me, we went to have a pint of beer together; I told him I was waiting for a lad whom I had sent into that shop, but it would make very little difference I said, as I should do some of the work in the morning and take it in; I tied the work all up but the boots in my apron, and unfortunately drinking a drop too much, I lost all but the pair of boots; the next day when I found the loss, I in a distracted state of mind went and enquired to find the work, but in vain; I went to a friend, to inform him of my sitution, at the White Horse, Moor-lane, on purpose to get him to go to Mr. Clark, to speak for me; when Mr. Clarke came into the house, Mr. Clark said are you not the man, I directly owned myself as such, I never denied it; I had eight or nine respectable friends last night; I am a man that bore a good character, and a man that worked hard for my living.</p>

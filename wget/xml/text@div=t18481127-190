                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at Moss's-alley, St. Sa<lb></lb>viour's. On the night of 13th Nov., about twelve o'clock, I was returning home along Bankside with my wife, her sister, Mrs. Dooling, and her husband—I passed the prisoner, who I know by sight, by working in the same neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—he was standing on the pavement, near Bailey and Pegg's iron<lb></lb>wharf—I crossed the road to make water, and Dooling crossed also—I left Dooling there and walked on—I heard some words between him and the prisoner, but could not hear what they were—I called out to Dooling to follow me, which he instantly did—I heard Dooling say to him that if he made use of such language as that to him again, for twopence he would fetch him a thump ov er the head—the prisoner passed by Dooling and came up to me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270126"></xptr>
               <p>and said, "<hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>" that is a nickname I go by, "did you suppose I was going to do that man any harm?" said, "No, I do not suppose you was; I know he would not do you any harm, for he is too quiet a man; we are going home civil, do you do the same"—he then said, "B—y <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>, I know yon, take that," and stuck a knife into me—he left it sticking in my side, and attempted to run away—I stepped forward, caught hold of his collar, and held him till Dooling came up—he was niven into custody to a policeman—I took the knife out of my side and gave it to Dooling—the wound was on the seventh rib—it bled all the way to the station—the knife went through a white duck frock, a blue Guernsey frock, and my shirt—Mr. Odglincr, the surgeon, has attended me ever since—I have suffered greatly from the wound, and have not been able to earn a penny since.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing along Bankside on the night in question with the prosecutor and our wives—I saw the prisoner; I stayed behind, when Wallington went on—the prisoner and I stood three or four yards from each otlier, making water—he used some disgusting language to me which is not fit to mention, and I said for twopence I would give him a thump on the head—that was all that passed—Wallington called out to me to come on, and not have any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him, and I went on—the prisoner followed and passed me—lie went up to Wallington, made a blow at his right side, and said, "B—<hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>, I know you; take that!"—I was about ten yards off—the pri<lb></lb>soner attempted to run away—Wallington caught him—I went up and he gave me the knife—I took it to the station, and there saw it was bloody.</p>

               <p>not see Wallington strike the prisoner a dreadful blow on the nose—I did not strike him, and I believe no one else did—I saw a little bit of a scab on his nose before the Magistrate, as big as a pin's point—it was not a fresh wound—the Magistrate asked him where he got his nose damaged—he did not say that I or my friend did it—I do not know what he said—I lodge in the same house as Wallington, in Lad's-court, Moss's-alley—the woman who was with me is not my wife—she is not Wellington's wife's sister—we have not talked about this matter at all since—the prisoner was not very drunk—he had had something to drink, but knew what he was about.</p>

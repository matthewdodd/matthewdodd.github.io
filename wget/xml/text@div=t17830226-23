             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was standing at the door of Mr. Hitchin, Bridge-street, Westminster, when I came to the door with the box, it was on Friday, the 10th of January, between five and six in the evening; he asked if I did not bring the box from the Castle Falcon, he said, give it me, you have been a damned long while bringing the box; I said, I do not know you, I shall take it in; he said, he was Mr. Hitchin's clerk, and I gave him the box; he paid me nine-pence, he said, he should lose three-pence by giving me nine-pence, for Mr. Hitchin never gave but six-pence; he went in doors with the box; I stopped at the shop window, and saw him put the box down, then I went home.</p>
               <p>You did not see any thing more of the prisoner? - There was another man that spoke to me as I came along, but I do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not it me, did not you see me in Holborn? - There was a chest of shoes sell out of a cart in Chancery-lane, and a man asked me to watch, I saw the man stand by the baker's shop door, I never saw any more of him.</p>
               <p>Was that after the time he got this box or before? - After the time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at Mr. Hitchin's when the box came in, the prisoner is the man that brought it in, I never saw him before, I saw him take it away again, he was in the shop about two minutes, I was there with my husband's work and mine, waiting for my wages.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop? - Nobody but Mrs. Hitchin and me.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing when he brought this box in? - There was a few questions passed between Mrs. Hitchin and him, but I cannot tell what they were; I did not see him deliver the box out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This witness swore to Sir Sampson Wright, and said, she believed he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260047"></xptr> was the man; then she looked round and fixed upon a young gentleman, an ensign, and said, he was the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brooks. I could not rightly recollect his face then, but I did after.</p>
               <p>How came you to mistake another man for him? - I was quite astonished when I went into the place, I was never there before, but as soon as I saw this man's face, I partly knew him.</p>
               <p>You partly knew him? - Yes, my Lord, I knew him.</p>
               <p>You are sure now this is the man? - I am sure this is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is Sir Sampson Wright will testify, I believe, what I have said as to this matter.</p>
               <p>Mrs. HITCHIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner, he came into our shop on Friday, the 10th of January, between five and six; he brought in a box, and asked if that was Mr. Jones's; I said, this is Mr. Hitchin's, but one Mr. Jones lodges here.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a Mr. Jones lodged at your house? - Yes: he said, one of our men will have it that this box is directed for Mr. Jones; but this direction is not for Mr. Jones; I said, if it is not for Mr. Jones, I think it is for Mr. Hitchin, for we very often have boxes of that sort, and I saw carriage paid at the corner, and I said, I know by that carriage paid, that box is for my husband, I had some halfpence in my hand, and I laid them down to read the directions; he turned out, and said, I must call the other man, he is gone higher up to see for Mr. Jones, for he will have it that it is for Mr. Jones: there is one Mr. Jones, a housekeeper, higher up in the street; and I sent up there to enquire if a porter had brought a box there, but he had not; the prisoner went out, and I did not see him any more.</p>
               <p>Court. This must be, I suppose, candle light, when he came into your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose he might stay in the shop? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubts concerning the prisoner being the man? - I have no doubts at all, when he came into the shop, he had a pen in his hand and no hat on, which made me look very hard at him, and I h ad a very good light in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you conceive any doubts about him at the justices? - No, Sir, I knew him as he came up the steps into the office, when he had his hat on, I thought him to be the same man then; and when his hat was taken off I was perfectly sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>You say there was carriage paid marked at the corner of the box? - Yes, and I thought it to be the hand writing of a gentleman who used to send us such boxes from Birmingham, one or two in a week we have had sometimes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you use to deal with Mr. Radenhurst? - Yes, for I suppose a year and a half, or a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Were the boxes that were sent to you from time to time like that? - Yes, that made it strike me to be a box from him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing more to offer to the gentlemen of the Jury, I am truly innocent: I never saw the lady before, she looked round very carefully, she fixed her eyes very attentively, and said I was the man; she said, she could not take upon her to swear that, she swore to the best of her knowledge; this woman immediately started up, and said, I was the man: Sir Sampson Wright said, shall we commit this young man or not? and after some conversation, I was committed. It was calling at a house where a person had some stolen goods, and asking what is the matter, and they knowing me, that was the occasion of my being drawn into this premunire; I have no witnesses; this affair has been the occasion of my mother's committing suicide; she lays dead on the occasion now, and my father is obliged to be watched.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hitchin. Did you doubt about the prisoner? - I made no doubt at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260048"></xptr> all, nor I was not asked whether I doubted him, but when they asked me whether I saw the man, I said yes, I said, I believe this is the man, I was sure he was the man.</p>

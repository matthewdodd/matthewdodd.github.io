            . I am a watchman. I heard a rattle spring, and went to Mr. Wilson's; I got over into the area, and found the two prisoners sitting on a cask in one of the vaults - I looked, and found a piece cut out of the pannel of the door; I found this knife by the hole in the door, and also a candle - the knife was outside the door, close by the piece which was cut out; I went into the vault, and found a hammer and wrench, which fits into the place which was forced out; after the prisoners were taken to the watch-house, we searched again, and I saw my fellow-watchman find a phosphorous-box, with a few matches, behind where they sat - the door was not open till Bates opened it; a man could not have entered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190049"></xptr>at that hole - the door opens into a pantry, and then a door on the right leads into the kitchen.</p>

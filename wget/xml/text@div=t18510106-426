                  </hi>. I am a roller-maker, of Newington. On 6th Jan., between one and two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner close to London-bridge—she asked me to treat her—I went into a public-house, and treated her—I left the house—she came out with me—I wanted to leave her—she would not go from me—she put her hand into my pocket and took my money—I asked her to return it to me—she said she had not got it—I had one shilling and two sixpences—I am not aware whether I had any 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—I told her I would give her into custody if she did not return it—she said she had not a farthing of money about her—a policeman came up—I charged her with stealing the money—she told the policeman he might search her; he would find no money—when we got to the station she put down one shilling, two sixpences, and one 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, on the desk, and said I had given it her—I had not given her a farthing.</p>

I was on duty—I received the prisoner from the prosecutor in High-street, Borough—he charged her with taking a shilling and two sixpences, he would not be sure whether he had a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece or not—she said she hoped I would not take her from such a false statement; if I would search her in the street I should find she had not a farthing on her—I said it was not my duty to search her—she went to the station; and when about to be searched, she put down 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the desk—she said the prosecutor gave it her—he Said he did not.</p>

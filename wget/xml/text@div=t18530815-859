On Sunday afternoon, 7th Aug., about a quarter past 4 o'clock, I was on a City steamboat, and saw the prisoner there—I saw him put his hand into a lady's pocket, and take something out—I laid hold of his hand as he was putting it to his coat pocket behind, and he dropped this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I went and spoke to the lady—the prisoner begged me to let him go, and said, if I did, he would not do it again—I found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

               <p>I did not see him stoop down at all—I had a job to get his hand out of his pocket, and then I found he had dropped the purse—there was three halfpence and a farthing in it—there were a great many people going to the steamboats—this happened on the pier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Hockley, in Hampshire—the prisoner is my uncle—I have not had any quarrel with him. A few days before the 27th of September, I saw him in the village, but was not year enough to speak to him—he did not call on me—I kept a mare in my stable there—I have four or five—the prisoner has been with me, and ✗ it in ray stable—I turned the mare out into my meadow, which is enclosed, and lost it—I came to London, and found the prisoner at his own house in Coram-place, Russell-square—I told him I was sorry I was under the necessity of detaining him—I did not tell him what for—the policeman came up just as I had taken him—I have seen the mare in a every-stable kept by Young, in London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-dealer, and live in Little Guildford-street, Russell-square. On Monday, the 30th of September, the prisoner brought the mare to a stable in Woburn-mews, but not in my presence—he came and asked me if I wanted to buy a mare—he afterwards brought, it, and engaged a stall of a woman, in my presence, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-week—he said he should not want it longer, as he was going to sell the mare—I afterwards saw him with the mare—he wanted to sell it for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have known him twelve months—he asked me to put it into my cart on Monday afternoon, and he accompanied me—he told me he had got her from below Devizes, in Wilts, for a bad debt of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards agreed to buy her for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not below the value for my work—I bought it about eleven or twelve o'clock next day—I told him I would pay him by nine o'clock at light—he called and got 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my wife while I was out—I have a paper which he gave her—she is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I never sold the mare to him. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It was to a friend of mine—it is all one—it was for me—he sent another man in to say I should have it for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I did not want it—he then sent in word I should have it for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1 agreed—he said he should like me to have it, because I would take care of it, and it was one he had brought up from a colt—he brought it to me himself with an hempen halter, and gave it up to my hands.</p>

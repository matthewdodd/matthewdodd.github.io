                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Mongan, a bricklayer's labourer. On the 7th of July, we lived in Black Swan-court, Golden-lane, and occupied the lower room—on the 6th of July, I put my hus<lb></lb>band's clothes into the box, at the foot of the bed, between eight and nine o'clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170079"></xptr>
               <p>in the morning—it has no lock to it—left about eleveno'clock at night—nobody but my two children were in the room, and they were fast asleep—my eldest child is five years old—I locked the door, and put the key in my bosom—the shutters were fastened, and the room was quite safe—I returned at about oneo'clock, with my husband and a party who had been with me, and who lived on the first-floor—I opened the door with the key, as usual—we went to bed, and between eight and nine next morning I took the lid off the box, and seeing the bundle was not as large as it was when I left it, I looked and missed a jacket and trowsers from the buttom of the box—they had been under the bundle—my husband had gone out, and came home to breakfast, when I missed them—on Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, about ten o'clock, Mrs. Kelly, who lives in the nighbour<lb></lb>hood, brought these clothes home, and inquired for Mrs. Roxborough, to give tnem to her—she showed them to Mr. Clements—Mrs. Murphy was called down—Kelly gave the things into her hands—she is not here, she lived in the court—Murphy gave them to me—they were out of my sight from the time Kelly brought them till Murphy delivered them to me—I came into my own room; and whether I gave the things into Murphy's hands, or took them into my room, I cannot say, but I went in serch of a policeman—I gave the things to the policeman that morning—the prisoner lodged next door to me—I have know her some time—I was out of my room on Monday morning, but I was not absent long—I gave the things to the policeman before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Kelly, and live in Hartshorn-court. The prisoner is my husband's first cousin—on a Monday, in the beginning of July, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my door, but did not come in—I expected her to come, and went to open to my door—she did not lodge with me, but she was aware that I and my hus<lb></lb>band had had a few words, and in consequence of those words, I told her I would not go to bed that night, but sit in the chair—she said I was not going tobed directly, she would, perhaps, call again—I said I would not go to bed—she came again at ten minutes to one—she said, "D----n the men! they are all alike; I have been obliged to run away from mine with his trowsers and Ned's jacket; he wants to take them away to pledge them to-morrow for liquo; I want to leave them in your care till I call for them"—she did not say when she thought of going away, she said, "Mrs. Kelly, I shall not take these things to-night, but will call for them in the morning"—I said, "Very well, ma'am"—before she went away, she said to me, "Has he (meaning my husband) asked you for these things?"—I said, "No; he put no questions about them"—on the following morning I had to go from home at ten o'clock, and expected to be from home nearly all day, and was afraid she would want the things while I was absent—I took them in my apron, and went in search of her residence—I inquired of a <hi rend="italic">translator of shoes,</hi> at the corner of the court where she lived, and told him my business—Mrs. Murphy came to where I stood, and in a few minutes I went up to the prisoner's door—I had given Mrs. Murphy the clothes—she know me—I saw her again in about ten minutes, while I stood at the prisoner's door—she had not got the clothes then—I stood at the door till the prisoner came out with a policeman—I went to Worship-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170080"></xptr>
               <p>with them I saw Mrs. Morgan come down to the bottom of the court—Mrs. Murphy had gone up the court to her, I suppose, for Mrs. Morgan came down directly—Mrs. Murphy took the clothes from me—where she took them to I do not know—I gave them to her at the corner of the court—they were produced when Mrs. Morgan came—they were in my sight, as near as I can remember, when Mrs.Morgan, Murphy, and myself were together—I know nothing of them after I gave them to Mrs.Murphy—I never saw the handkerechief open which contained them—they were open when the prisoner brought them to me—I have not seen them since, except wrapt up in a handkerchief—I never saw them open, at I delivered them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who wrapped them in the handkerchief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Pliceman, I suppose, My hushand was in bed at eleven o'clock the night the prisoner came—I saw nobody in the house but the prisoner—we have a gas-light close to the window—I did not take any notice of the clothes till Wednesday morning, when her cousin asked what she had left in my care—I then noticed them—it was at six o'clock in the morning I gave them to Mrs. Murphy, and when she came back she had nothing with her—the prisoner and I were not always good friends—I kept her at a distance—I was not her bitter enemy—we were on the most intimate terms till the Whitsunday previous—she never said my husband left a former wife to live with me—she has been the cause of a qurrel between us, but not on that subject—I have not had quarrels with her about my husband—I heard her speak ill of three years ago to him, and I kept her at a dis<lb></lb>tance on account of his repeated warnings that she was no good—I live about a hundred yards from Morgan's house—I have repeatedly prayed for the prisoner—at the same time she is an enemy of mine.</p>

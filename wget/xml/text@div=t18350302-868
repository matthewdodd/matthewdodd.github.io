                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Newman. I live in King's Bench-walk, St. George's—we keep cows—on the 20th of December, the two prisoners called at my husband's house—he was not in town—it was between ten and eleven o'clock—they asked me if I had any cows to sell—I said I had three cows to sell, and I did not care which of them I sold—both asked me if they could see them—I said they were in the shed, and they could see them if they liked—I and my son went into the shed with them, and showed them eight cows—they examined two or three, and asked me the price of the first two—I told them 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they were in calf—they said they could feel no calf in them—they left them, and walked to the cow in question—Gorken said, "I can feel a calf in this—a good big calf," and said to Eld ridge, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, go you up and feel her"—I had seen Gorken in the market, for about six months before, but had never spoken to him before—Eldridge said he could feel the calf, and asked me the price—I told him I could not take less than 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—Gorken called me out into the yard, and said, if I sold the cow to Eldridge I should sell her to a good customer, and I should be sure of the money when I delivered her—we walked back into the shed, and Eldridge said, "I will give you 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said I could not take 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her—they went aside, and talked together, then came back again and asked if I would take 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said I would not—we all four walked out of the shed together—I and my son followed them out into the yard—I thought they were going into the street, and wished them good morning—I went in<lb></lb>doors—my son called me out again, and Eldridge said he would givt me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would take it—Gorken stood under the gate, about ten yards from him—I cannot say whether he could hear what Eldridge said—Eldridge asked if I could let my son take the cow up to his place—my son said, "I do not know where you live"—he asked him if he knew Kennington-lane—my son said he did—he told him to bring her to Ken<lb></lb>nington-lane, at four o'clock, and he would meet him—he then went away—he told me three or four times that he would pay me—he said, when my son delivered the cow, he would return the money back to me for it at the time—he said that in the shed—he said he would send the money back—Eldridge then left the yard—he came back in about two minutes, knocked at the street door, and said he had altered his mind, and if I would let him bring the cow in the course of half an hour to Kenniogton-lane, he would meet him there—he said, "I will return the money back by your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020175"></xptr>
               <p>son for you"—I sent my son with the cow in about ten minutes, and di<lb></lb>rected him what to do, and expected him to bring back either the cow or the money—he was not to part with the cow without the money—I gave him those directions in the presence of both the prisoners—my son was absent about two hours, and then returned with the cow—Gorken came again between six and seven o'clock in the evening—it was dark then—Gorken asked if we had been with the cow—my son said he had, and that nobody came to him—Gorken said, "Well, it is all right, I am going to the place now; bring the cow with me, and I will help you to drive her to the place"—before they went away I said to my son, in Gorken's presence, "Do not you leave the cow without the money"—Gorken turned round and said, "When your son delivers the cow he will receive the money, you may be sure"—he said the money was as sure as the Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land—my son, and Gorken, and the cow all three went away together—when my son returned about nine o'clock, he had neither cow nor money—I have never had either since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's son. The prisoners came on the 25th of December—nothing was said about the cow being for Saps<lb></lb>worth—the prisoners were both present when the price was mentioned—it was mentioned once or twice—they must both have heard the whole conversation—I went with the cow to Kennington-lane—I was not to leave it till I obtained the money—I got there between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—I inquired at several houses, and waited in the lane with the cow nearly two hours—I was not to take it to any parti<lb></lb>cular part of the Jane—the lane is about one-eighth of a mile long—a person cannot see from one end to the other, as there is a turning—I saw nobody, and came back with it—I was at home when Gorken came, about six o'clock—it was dark then—Gorken said, "Have you been with the cow?"—I said I had taken her, but could find nobody there, and had brought her back—he said, "If you will come along with me now, I will go with you and show you the place"—my mother said to me, "Mind, do not leave it without the money, either bring back the cow or money"—Gorken turned round and said, "The money is as sure as the Bank of England"—I went to Kennington-lane with him—he took me to Eldridge's house, just through Vauxhall-gate—I saw Eldridge directly we got there—Gorken went on a little before me to the house, and both came back to me together, and Gorken said, "There is the cow;" and said to me, "Help Eldridge to drive her into the yard," and then I could have the money—Eldridge said, "Drive her in," but before that, Gorken said, "I must go, you can drive her into the yard, and then you can have the money"—he then went away, leaving me with Eldridge—we both drove her into the yard—Eldridge and a young lad in the yard tied the cow up—we came out of the yard—there is a public-house nearly opposite his house—he said, "Go into the public-house, and I will come to you in five minutes, and pay you the money"—I waited at the corner of the lane opposite the public-house door, and then I went into the parlour of the public-house—Eldridge came in and called for a pot of ale—we sat there drinking it—he said nothing, and I said nothing—we were there five or ten minutes—then a man named Sapsford (I knew him before, but never spoke above a dozen words with him in my life) came in, and sat down a little while between me and Eldridge, drinking—Sapsford swore and said, "Is your father come home yet?"—I said, "No, he is not,"—he then said, "Eldridge has bought this cow for me; there is a little difference between your father and me, and here is the balance of the money"—I said I did not know any thing at all about it—I had not sold him the cow—I had sold Eldridge the cow, and looked to him for the money—he said, "It is no odds, the cow was bought for me, and here is the difference"—I said I would not leave the cow without the money—I would either have the cow or money—Eldridge was present—I could not take the cow away, for Sapsford said if I touched a bolt or gate belonging to him, he would have me punished—I went to the gate, but I could not get it away—the gates were secured—I have never seen it since.</p>

Eldridge was my cow-keeper—I have had dealings with Newman's father for grains—I have not seen him for the last five or six months—I met Newman and Eldridge at the Elephant and Castle—I had a bill against Newman's father—I went home and fetched the bills—I tendered him the difference, which was six guineas and fourpence halfpenny—the money was put on the table before him, and also the bills—he said, after he looked round, that he should not look to me for it at all—when he found I did not offer him the full amount, he said he should look to Eldridge—I told him I had been many times to his house after the money, and the last time but one that I went, Mrs. Newman told me her husband was gone away and had taken the money away, and she did not mean to pay his debts—I asked young Newman if that was the case—he said that he did not mean to pay his father's debts—I spoke to him about the balance his father owed me, ten times before this occurrence—he owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cow is in my place now—Eldridge had no property in the cow whatever.</p>

               <p>the house—it is Bond-street, South Lambeth—the cow is behind my house, in the shed—it was there yesterday—I believe it to be there now—I know Gorken by his driving my cows home—I always employed him on these jobs, driving my cows, and taking them to Smithfield for sale, for three or four years—I do not give my name and address to persons I purchase cows of in Smithfield; it is never required—I do not give a receipt when I sell cows—I have got my name on my house—I do not think I have ever used my own name in purchasing cows—perhaps I have bought about ten cows in a year—I get my living by selling milk—the last cow I bought was of Mr. Dawkins—I did not send Eldridge for it—I bought it at a fair—Eldridge has worked for me four or five years—I never sent him to Newman's before—the night before this transaction, Gorken came and told me Mrs. Newman had offered a cow for sale, and I went to Eldridge—I asked his mother if he was at home—he came down—I asked him to go with Gorken and buy the cow for me—I cannot say whether I told him to mention my name or not—I will not swear I did not tell him not to mention my name—I expected to meet young Newman in Kenning<lb></lb>ton-lane with the cow—Eldridge did not come to me in the course of the day about it—I saw him over night—I do not recollect that he came to me next morning—I was not in Kennington-lane, not through the turnpike—I am not sure whether I saw him that day before I saw the cow—I do not think I saw Gorken after it was agreed that Eldridge should go and buy the cow—I was not in the lane at all that whole day—the cow was to be brought to the turnpike gate by the Elephant and Castle—I swear I was not in the lane that morning—I might be at the turnpike—I live close by it—I was not waiting at the gate, expecting to get the cow—I never went through, that I know of—I cannot tell where I was when the cow came—I did not see it till it was in my shed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell young Newman, when he came with the cow, if he dared to touch the cow or the place you would make him suffer for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nothing of the kind—I used no violence to him—I told him they had gives me a great deal of trouble after the money—I considered it only a fair bargain—I have had the cow ever since—the gates are open all day—I did not shut them before the boy went away—I went to the public-house when I was sent for—Newman or Eldridge sent for me—I did not desire the boy to go in and drink—I swear the boy did not demand to have the cow back, and I refuse—he said he would have the full amount, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I did not place the full money before him he said he would not deal with me for it—nobody demanded the cow—he did not say he would not go away without the cow or the money—he went away contented—he might have had the cow if he chose—I did not stop it—he might have had the full amount of money—they applied for it afterwards to Mrs. Eldridge, but not to me—if he had come for it, or any body had applied for it, he might have had the cow or the money—I will deliver it to the constable now, if you please—Mrs. Eldridge was applied to for the money, and she referred them to me—if they had come for the cow or money, they might have had either.</p>

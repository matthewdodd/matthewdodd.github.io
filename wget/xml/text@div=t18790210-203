                  </hi> I am the wife of the prisoner—when first examined on the 18th December I was in the hospital—I went to work at 23, Beaumont Square, Mile End Road—I have been married to the prisoner three years the 28th of last November—I summoned him several times for beating me and threatening me—the summons was a week or a fortnight before this happened—when his name was called he ran away from the Court—he had not been before the Magistrate—he threatened several times to buy a razor and cut my throat—I have been in danger ever since I have been married—on 9th Dec. he came to me at 22, Beaumont Square, at about half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he knocked at the door—I opened it and said I was in hopes he had got a place, because he was out of work, and I was paying the rent—he said "No I haven't come for that, you b——; what are you going to do? I mean to do for you," and he took the chopper out of his pocket and hit me a blow in the forehead, and I fell to the ground—he struck me a great many times—I put me arm up to try and save myself—at last he lifted my head up to see if I was dead—my face was buried in mat in the passage, and he lifted my head from one side to the other, and said "You b——, I've done it; I told you I would: you won't move no more, you b——," and away he walked—a policeman came afterwards—I opened the door by some means or other—I lost a great deal of blood—the passage was floating with blood—that is the chopper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) that did it—it was my own chopper that I used at home for the wood—I have never heard him say anything about the chopper—he has often said he would do something for Mr. Dipple, because he would not give him a character, some time before this happened—he did not threaten him—he has said many a time that he would swing for me on the gallows.</p>

You dragged me out of bed to go to work on the 28th Nov.—you would not work, and I had to work—you slept in bad till 12 or 1 in the day—you turned the baby topsy-turvy, and it frightened me, I thought the child would go into a fit—I rushed towards the child and then you hit me—I did not throw the basin at you, I threw a cup—I said no bad word—you told people a man at the docks cut your head—I threw the cup because that morning I had to go out to work and I had nothing to eat and nothing for the child, and I said "Bill, you're no man, or you would not let a wife and child go out as you do," and with that you beat me and took up a lamp to throw at me, and I felt so crushed that I should have to go to work in that way, and I took up a cup and threw at you—you had been beating me that morning—I had the marks about my face, and the baby was in my arms when you flogged me—I was going to summons you for it—when you came back from the hospital I was at my place of work, and the mistress was afraid to let me be seen because you had threatened me—I did not swear at you—on the Monday I was at work at 22, Beaumont Square—I went to the workhouse for protection, I stayed there three days—I had not gone to the play with another man—I will take my dying oath it is not true—it is not true that there was any young man of whom you were jealous—on the Saturday when I went to the Court you had not seen me for a week, I had been in the workhouse three days—when you asked me to forgive you, I said I had put up with it so long I must have some protection from you—this chopper does not belong to me, it was one exactly like it, but a little longer—it did look very much like the one we had at home—the one belonging to me had notches in it—I</p>

I went there and asked her to come home; she would not, and then I did it."</p>

I am a potman at the Albert Arms, Bancroft Road, Mile End—the prisoner came there on the 9th Dec, about a quarter past 4—I was pouring some hot water into a tub to wash some bottles—the prisoner said "There is nothing like plenty of hot water," and I said "No"—he walked down to the bottom of the skittle-ground—there are some old window panes standing there—he said "You have still got some old window panes there," and I said "Yes"—I saw him lean over, and he came back and pulled out an old scarf from his pocket and said "Do you want to bay a scarf?"—I said "No"—he said "I will sell it for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "If you want 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I'll give you the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and he said "Good-bye," and as he went to shake hands with me I noticed his hands covered with blood, and before I shook hands with him he ran over into the pot-house, where I clean the pots, and washed his hands in some fine sand in a sand-tub—he said "Good-bye; I have done it"—I asked him what he had done—he said "I have knocked her down three times with a hatchet"—then he went through into the bar, and I followed him—as he was going out of the house he said "Good bye; you won't see any more of me until the rope is round my neck in Newgate"—when he was gone I went back into the skittle-ground where I had seen him go—on looking near the window-sashes I found there this chopper—there was blood on it—it was not wet, but had just dried on—there was a stream of blood right down the blade—I handed it to the constable.</p>

I am surgeon to the London Hospital—about 4.30 on the night of the 9th December the prosecutrix was brought in—she was bleeding from many wounds—there were seven incised wounds on the back of the right forearm and hand, the most serious one 2 inches in length; it fractured and splintered the small bone of the arm—there were six incised wounds on the scalp, varying from 11/2 to 21/2 inches in length, two of them penetrating deeply into the skull and through the outer table of the skull straight behind the ear—she had lost a large quantity of blood, and was fainting, but had not quite lost consciousness—I considered her life in danger.</p>

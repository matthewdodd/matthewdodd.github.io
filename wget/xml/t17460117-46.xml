               <p>Q. How much did it come to?</p>
               <p>Ashley. Eight Pounds eight Shillings and Sixpence. Then he presented this Bill, and he desir'd the Change; for he was to buy other Things with the rest of the Money. And looking on the Bill, I found it was not accepted: Upon which I told him I would send my Clerk and get it accepted. He then told me that Mr. Jackson seldom underwrit his Bills. Upon which I told him, if Mr. Jackson, or any of his Clerks, would say they would pay it, when it was due, I would be very well contented, and give him the Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Jackson?</p>
               <p>Asbley. Yes, Sir, I know him by Character.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have taken the Bill if they had said they would pay it?</p>
               <p>Ashley. Yes. But the Prisoner said he would carry it, and get it accepted. Accordingly he went out and brought it, with what he said was an Acceptance. But Jackson was spell'd with an x, instead of ck; the Name stood Jaxson. I then suspected it, but did not tell him so. I told him, if he would come To-morrow Morning, about Nine o'Clock, then the Things would be ready, and I would give him the Change. He was very pressing to have the Change that Night, and he would come for the Goods the next Morning. He had several Excuses, but I put him off. In the mean Time I sent to Mr. Jackson; and the Answer my Clerk brought from Mr. Jackson, or some of Mr. Jackson's Servants, that he had accepted no such Bill that Day, and that it was a Forgery, and desir'd the Person and Bill might be stopp'd. In the Morning, at the Time appointed, he, the Prisoner, came; and at the same Time Jackson's Clerk was at my House. Then the Prisoner took the said Bill out of his Pocket, and wrote the Indorsement upon it, and gave it to me. When I had it in my Possesion I shew'd it to Mr. Jackson's Clerk; and he told me that was none of his Master's Acceptance; for it was neither like his Hand-writing, nor did he spell his Name so. Upon which he was charg'd with the Constable, and had before my Lord Mayor, where Mr. Jackson was present, who is now here.</p>

               <p>Jackson. The Hand-writing upon the Back is the Indorsement of the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>

               <p>The Question and Doubt in Court arose, Whether this, in Point of Law, is Forgery within the Act of Parliament. To be sure, as was observ'd, it was within the Meaning of the Act. Now, the Words of the Act of Parliament are; That if any Person shall forge an Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange. No body has prov'd that it was Mr. Warner's Bill of Exchange: So that it was a bare Forgery of Acceptance, but not of an Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange. <rs id="t17460117-46-verdict183" type="verdictDescription">

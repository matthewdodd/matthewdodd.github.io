                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Monday, of Eastbourne—he had a quantity of hay, more than he wanted, in October last, and by his direction I advertised 40 tons for sale in the "West Sussex Gazette" with my initials—application was to be made to Messrs. Smith &amp; Son, at the Railway Station, Eastbourne—I received this letter in answer—a letter was written by my master; I saw him write it—afterwards we received this other letter in reply—in consequence we had about 180 trusses of hay cut and trussed and sent off on the 12th January, I think, to George John<lb></lb>stone, 776, Old Kent Road, from Berwick Station, which is about eleven miles from Eastbourne—in consequence of these documents, we sent to the same address a quantity of black oats, about 10 quarters, on the 18th Jan<lb></lb>uary about 150 quarters, altogether—my master had purchased them—this bill afterwards came down—my master took it to the bank—upon this I came to London, I think on the 4th February—I went to Johnstone's house, 776, Old Kent Road—I did not find him there—I called again three times, but did not find him—I then communicated with the detectives, Kimber and Fox—I afterwards went to Ringer's place about the 13th or 14th February, at Southgate Road, Hoxton—I saw some black oats there; nearly a sack: some close to the door outside; not any hay—Fox asked if he had any dealings with Johnstone, 776, Old Kent Road—Ringer said "I have had dealings with Johnstone; all the hay and corn came from Johnstone's"—I asked him if those oats outside the door came from John<lb></lb>stone—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you any more?" and I understood him to say he had not—I asked him to allow me to weigh the oats, and he gave me half a gallon to weigh them in—they weighed 2 lbs. and a quarter good weight—there are eight gallons to a bushel—I said there were from 371bs. to 381bs., and I believe they were the property I sent for my master—he said again they were what he had from Johntsone—I looked inside the shop and found underneath some white oats, eight or nine sacks of the same sort—I asked him about the hay, and he said he had sold it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290091"></xptr>
               <p>I said "These are more of the same oats?"—he said "Yes"—what I have stated is the nature of my interview at his house. (<hi rend="italic">Documents handed to witness.</hi>) These were received by my master—I believe them to be my master's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. My master bought four ricks of hay; they contained 86 tons, which were paid for—I sent up to London about 800 odd trusses—I believe there are 40 trusses to the ton—my master gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for it—there are four trusses less to a load than there are to a ton—each truss, as usually cut, would weigh half a hundredweight—generally we buy oats by weight—I think white oats weigh a little over black—the oats I sent up to London weighed over 37 lbs. to the bushel; the oats were weighed by Detective Kimber, in the presence of Mr. Wood, a corndealer, and fairly; they weighed over 37, good weight—I believe the name of Ringer was over Ringer's door—I went into a large yard; there were temporary partitions, which made two other yards—Ringer went into the yard; I saw him there at first—I do not remember whether he came up to Fox or Fox went up to him—I was 5 yards behind—I did not see Fox read or say to Ringer he had got a warrant for his apprehension; I saw him with the paper—I have not the least doubt he was reading it—I heard Ringer say "Yes, I know Johnstone; I have had transactions with him"—Fox said "Have you had any transactions with him lately with reference to hay and oats?"—Ringer said "Yes, I had about 20 quarters of oats and 7 tons of hay from him," and he said he sold the hay—I do not recollect Ringer saying "I believe I gave him a cheque for the hay and the oats"—I think I heard Mr. Fox say "It is a long time ago; has that cheque been returned to you from the bank?"—I am not sure that Mr. Ringer said he had not received them back from the bank yet—I heard Mr. Fox ask him if he could give the name of any single person he had sold the hay to—I cannot say that he said "I sold some to Mr. Briley, a carman, in Ber<lb></lb>mondsey "—I heard Mr. Briley swear that he did sell him some—some of the conversation took place in the yard and some in the shop; I followed Ringer and Fox into the shop—I there saw the sacks containing the black oats—I said then "I think this is my master's corn"—Ringer at once said "Yes, that is some that I bought from Mr. Johnstone"—I found at Ringer's a vast quantity of corn—by the shop it did not appear to me that he was a dealer in a very large way—there was a large quantity of all sorts of corn there; I never noticed carrots—I did not notice in the yard four or five horses—I did not go into the loft; I saw some sacks at the loft window—I do not know whether Mr. Fox went up into the loft—I do not recollect seeing some vans there—I never noticed any cabs—I do not think Fox overheard all the conversation I had; I do not think he swore that—he was present—I do not know that Fox took away every bill and invoice and receipt that Ringer had on his premises—I saw the bills—I did not see Fox take those away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector M</hi>). I received information of the alleged obtaining by false pretences of this hay and corn—I saw the last witness, Baker—I obtained a warrant and went with Baker to Ringer's Place, 43, Southgate Road, Hoxton, where he carried on business—I saw Ringer in the yard adjoining his house—I went in through the gate from the street—goods can be delivered into his yard from the street without going into his house—I read the warrant to him and told him there was a man named John<lb></lb>stone in custody for the same offence, George Johnstone, of 776, Old Kent Road (it is the Johnstone who lived at that address and who has committed suicide or died since this charge)—Ringer said "I know Johnstone and I have had many dealings with him"—I asked did he buy any corn or hay from him lately—he said he had bought from him 6 or 7 tons of hay and 20 quarters of oats—I said "Have you any documents in your possession relat<lb></lb>ing to that transaction?"—he said "I have not"—I said again "Have you any bill, receipt, or invoice for the oats or hay?"—he said "I have not"—I said "Have you got it in your possession now?" the oats and hay—he said "I have sold them"—I said "Have you paid Johnstone?"—he said "I gave him a cheque on account, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "It is some time since this trans<lb></lb>action took place, has that cheque been returned from your banker's?"—he said "No, it has not"—I said "This has been a large quantity, can you tell me any one to whom you sold it?"—he said "No"—after a moment or two he said "I sold some of it to a carman named Briley in Bermondscy"—I said "You acknowledge buying 20 quarters, those 20 quarters were in forty sacks, can you show me a single sack they were sent up in, belonging to Baker"—he said "No, I have not got any, they were shot in my shop when brought here"—I then made the remark that there was no space to shoot oats, not enough to shoot one, much less forty—there was no space, it was a remarkably small shop—he said "That is all I can say to you"—we did not find any of the hay upon the premises—we found nine sacks of oats—this was the 11th February—I looked round his premises and found in the shop covered carfully over with sacks, seven cases of champagne—his name was over the door and "corn dealer"—I found a chest of tea or a half chest, 50 lbs. or 52 lbs.; also several pound or half-pound packages of tea—I found in the loft over the gateway 500 sacks in bundles, there was no name upon them—I found a very large quanty of fine barley there and a large amount of corn beans—I counted twenty sacks in one place of the same quality—I found also a sack lifting machine, three or four barrels of cyder in the yard, and a very large amount of miscellaneous property belonging to a corn dealer—I asked him how these things came there and he said he knew nothing whatever of the champagne, it belonged to his son—he said "I sell tea"—we were then standing at the counter in the shop and I said "You have no weights or scales to retail or sell tea"—he said "I sell it in packages"—I said "Even packages would require weights and scales"—then he said shortly "I know nothing more about it"—I took him to the station, and he was charged—he said previously he had had many dealings with John<lb></lb>stone—on this occasion he said "This is the first dealing I have had with Johnstone and I am sorry for it"—he was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—I know the place of George Johnstone, 776, Old Kent Road, but 1 have never been in it—I asked for his books, the only one I found on him or on his premises I have here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) he had no day-books, cash-books, or ledgers—I could only find a cheque-book and a large number of receipts on a file, they are here—I said "For a man who carries on a large business, where are your books"—he said "That is all the books I have."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. There has been no charge against him for the champagne and the tea, nor the sacks—I saw the receipt produced at the police-court for the champagne—I found a great deal of corn of all descriptions, such as I should expect to find in a corn dealer's shop, who is doing a large business—the greater part of the shop was crowded with sacks—there were not nearly 5,000 sacks in the loft, but 500 in bundles—there were many hundreds—I do not know whether you would term them sea bags—they were not what was used for oats—I have got them—there was a great quantity of carrots on the premises—he may have purchased carrots when in business, to the amount of 20 tons per week—I did make inquiries, but only of one or two persons, and ascertained that he had been in business for forty years—I knew he was a salesman in Spitalfields Market for years—I was told twenty years—the yard was a large one, and there are partitions put up which form out of the large yard two smaller ones—I did not see horses there—I saw cabs and vehicles there—I re<lb></lb>member seeing two cabs; I knew they were Ringer's property—I found a van with his name upon it; such as a corn dealer would have to use in the ordinary course of his trade—I have ascertained that he was in the habit of keeping as many as five and six horses sometimes—I cannot say that he had four or five horses about this very time; he might have had—I have little or no doubt—Baker was with me in the yard; he did not keep close to me the whole time; in the yard he did—he would hear all the conver<lb></lb>sation I had with Ringer in the yard—when I read the warrant Baker was close enough to hear what he said—we all three went into the shop—I really could not say whether Baker went in first, or me—Baker said he saw a sack of his master's corn outside the door—he said "Come outside and I will show them to you"—what they said then I could not hear; there were two saoks outside the door, one of white and one of black oats—Ringer said "I think I bought those also of Johnstone"—he is a man over sixty living at the shop with his wife—he told me he paid one cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I remember Mr. Partridge asking if he could get that cheque, and on the next occasion his producing it; the cheque is dated 21st or 31st, it seems to be altered; there were two other cheques produced—I saw a receipt produced for the oats and hay before the Magistrate—there is a cheque for the 25th, and one for the 31st (<hi rend="italic">examining</hi>)—Idid not go into Johnstone's place, Kimber did—I took all these nine sacks of oats—I did not ascertain that a quantity of these very oats were sold by Johnstone to a Mr. Wood, a corn dealer—I ascertained that some were sold by Johnstone to a Mr. Clark—I should say Clark was not a respectable man—these oats were taken possession of by my directions—they have not been returned to Mr. Clark—they are stored at Mr. Wood's; I believe by Baker—I do not know Clark—there is no charge against him—he gave them up to Baker.</p>

               <p>I wrote the letters, and when delivery orders were required Johnstone came to me to write them out—when there were not any delivery orders he would go himself—I went with Johnstone to Ringer when the price was arranged for the oats, which was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per quarter, Johnstone was to receive from Ringer—Ringer was to fetch them from Willow Walk Station, 30 quarters—Mr. Mundy sent up a small sample of hay and oats—Johnstone received two cheques from Ringer, as far as my knowledge serves me—I was not at the police-court—this receipt is Johnstone's signature.</p>

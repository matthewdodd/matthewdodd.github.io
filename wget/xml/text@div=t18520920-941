                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 130). On the night of 15th Sept., about a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was on duty in Red Lion-alley, Cow-cross, and was called to the house of Blake, where a communication was made to me respecting the prisoner—he had these knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) one in each hand—I took the smaller one, the clasped knife, from his left hand, and while I was doing so he stabbed me three times in the left arm—one cut was an inch deep—it was afterwards sewed up by a surgeon—he is not here—I asked the prisoner what he had done it for—he said he had made up his mind to murder some one—I took him to the station—he was perfectly sober—he had not been drinking in the least.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I was in Red Lion-alley the people began to surround me, and to put their bands in my pockets. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw nobody lay hold of your pocket, you were running away from the people, and they were running after you; you said if they did not keep off you, you would put the knife into them; I took you for stabbing a Mrs. Blake, also a boy named Miles; you did not appear to have been injured at all; you did not ask me what I wanted with you.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the officer coming into my house—the prisoner ran away from me after he had stabbed me—there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, there was great confusion—I do not know what it was about, anymore than the prisoner came to me with a knife in each hand—there were only a few people in the alley—I do not know the prisoner, only by passing by—I do not know how he gets his living.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, in this alley. On the night of 15th Sept., in consequence of something I heard, I went out into the alley about half past 9 o'clock—there was a disturbance there—I saw the prisoner, with a knife in each hand swinging them about, and saying he would stab some one—the lad Miles was talking to him—I said "Why not go upstairs, and leave the lad alone"—he did not seem drunk—I had known him before, but never saw any difference in him to what he is at the present moment—I lost sight of him for half a minute, and then he turned back and passed me, with both knives in his hands—he never said anything, but made a dart at Martha Blake, and struck her with the knife—I went and looked at her hand, and then left her, and went to Cow-cross, and there he was swinging his hands with a knife in each hand—I saw a policeman come out of Whitecross-alley, and told him to take care, as the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and that he had stabbed Martha Blake—the policeman closed with him, and took one knife, and I took the other, and walked to the stationhouse with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pipe-maker's-court, Red Lion-alley. On the evening of 15th Sept. I saw the prisoner come into the court from the top—about five minutes afterwards he came up again, put his hands on my back and shoved me down on my face—there was no one running after him—he ran down Red Lion-alley, and I followed him—as I was passing by our court, I screamed out for my father, to ask the prisoner why he did it, and the prisoner went indoors and came down with an open knife in his hand—I asked him what he did it for—he said, "I will show you what I did it for," and made an attempt to stab me—he just caught me on the hand with the open knife, and then went up into his own lodging and fetched a second knife down—I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read, as follows</hi>; "When I was coming along the street, the people kept holding up their hands at me, and I was frightened, so I took the knife out of my pocket, and said, "If you do not be quiet I will have the knives through you.")</p>

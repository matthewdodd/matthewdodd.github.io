               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you subponaed the watchman or officer? - A. No; I had my reasons for not doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to visit a young lady at Stockwell? - A. I went to enquire about some ground that was to be let.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall in company with any other lady before you got to town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get into the company of any ladies? - A. I don't know what you mean by company; I met several, if you please to call them ladies, but I call them no better than brutes; I met twenty or thirty of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any young woman her hands about you in your way to town? - A. No; I don't remember any.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a thing had happened, you must remember it? - A. Yes; I remember two or three stopped me, and said, sir, will you go along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that the girl put her arms about your neck? - A. No one did, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of these brutes, as you call them, kiss you? - A. If she kissed me, I would not kiss her; I would as soon kiss a cow as one of those.</p>
               <p>Q. You read the Scriptures, I know, and must be acquainted that it is a criminal thing to kiss a cow? - A. I would as soon kiss one, as kiss one of those women, for I abhor them.</p>
               <p>Q. So do all men who are fond of kissing cows: so some one of those ladies put her arms about your neck? - A. If she did, it was not by my consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180066"></xptr>Q.Had you a sick of the asthma at that time? - A. I don't know when you mean.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you for three hours and an half; you say you left Stockwell at ten, and was on blackfriars-bridge at one? - A.Sometimes I could not walk it in three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you are sometimes three days on your journey from Stockwell to London? - A. No; but I cannot go up three pair of stairs sometimes, and am confined for two months together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that none of these women spoke to you on the road? - A. They asked me to stop, and go with them, but I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen by any accident that your breeches were unbuttoned in the road, and your shirt hanging out? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, were not your breeches unbuttoned, and your shirt hanging out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it was not? - A. No, not at all; I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any house between Stockwell and London? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was it you did stop? - A. Where I could, sometimes against a post, or where I could rest myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you met the girls first? - A.Soon after I passed the oblick.</p>
               <p>Q.Somewhere near Hughes's? - A. They were scattered up and down all over the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had not your breeches down, and that a mob followed you in consequence of it? - A. I will take my solemn oath it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very drunk? - A. I was not very drunk, I was sensible; I cannot say I had not been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q.You say you sat down over the middle arch? - A. I say, it was the first arch, about the fifth lamp towards the Surry side; you asked me which side it was, I said, the London; as to my sitting down, I said it was the first arch; the arch I set down on was nearer the Surry side than the London side; it was the first arch, and the fifth lamp, from the Surry side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the Albion Milis were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the first arch on that side? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. At what watch-house were the men searched? - A. It was by the Circus.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That is certainly in Surry, but I don't wish to avail myself of any objection.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was next to the Albion Mills? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this young man came from the middle of the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you, which way did he go? - A. He went to the watch-house with me and the watchman, and the other man with us.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you catch hold of him in the instant? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He came from the middle of the Bridge to where you were sitting down? - A. Yes, I think he did; I am certain he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he came from the middle of the road? - A. Yes, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was his companion? - A.They were both standing together when he took the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not charge his companion, he was equally guilty you know? - A. I did not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever state this fact before? - A. I don't know, I might.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear you did? - A. I told the constable I would not give charge of him, because I had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew, if he was in company, he was equally guilty? - A. I don't know how that may be; I am not acquainted with the Law, for I am more acquainted with the Golpel.</p>
               <p>Q.And I suppose you know the Commandment, which says, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take either the prisoner or the other in custody at all? - A.Certainly he is the man, though he is not dressed now as he was then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever take him or other man into custody? - A. I delivered them up to the watchman; I did this man, not both of them, though both went.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said to the prisoner that he had stole your watch, did he not say that it was an impudent charge, and that you must accompany him, and his friend said he would go with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say you must go to the watch-house? - A. No; though I was used ill by the watchman and him, and while they were taking him to the watch-house, my pocket was picked of my handkerchief, but I did not lay that to their charge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner say you must go with him to the watch-house, or did he make any charge against you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say that neither the prisoner or his friend said, you must go to the watch-house? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen did you pass on the road before the prisoner was taken into custody? - A.Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say, you gave charge to the first you met? - A. Yes; I called watch, and he came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that from the Bridge? - A.Just a little from the end, not far.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180067"></xptr>Q.Did you not pass a watchman on the Bridge? - A. It was not my first design to prosecute the man; my design was to get my propety, nothing more; I would not prosecute a man if you would give me the Indies; I was ignorant of the nature of it, and was compelled.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, did you not meet a watchman on the Bridge, before you came to the man who took charge of the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you your senses about you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.If there was a watchman standing on the Bridge, after the time you lost your watch, must you not have seen him? - A. I don't know, I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there was a watch-box within a yard or two of the place where you were robbed? - A. Yes, I believe there was, but if there was a box, there was no watchman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A.However, if there was, he was asleep; I called, watch, and the first that came I gave charge to.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, whether, at the moment you charged this man with picking your pocket, you called out, watch? - A.Certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. I called out, watch, as soon as ever I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear that, at the moment you were robbed, you called out, watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know, whether there is not a watch-box within two or three yards of the place? - A. I don't know any thing of the watch-box, there may be for what I know, but I am not certain; however, if there was a watch-box, there was no watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen did you pass as you went over the bridge? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts in the road was the prisoner when he was taken into custody? - A.Just by the turnpike; I cannot say positively to the spot; the watchman took him out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. His friend accompanied him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they told you they would take care you should be punished for charging him with a robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing was found on them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.His friend insisted on being searched, did he not? - A. I don't know that he was searched; I did not charge the other with any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And nothing found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Neither your pocket-handkerchief or watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first charged this young man, he told you where he had been, and that he was returning from the play, did he not? - A. No; a man came to me the next day, and told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not lay so? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect he said he would punish you for this? - A. He said, if he was locked up, he would make me suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You deny having been concerned with any girls on the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had your shirt hanging out of your breeches? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You give a negative to that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to tell me, and those gentlemen, that you were that length of time coming the distance you have stated? - A. I was.(Here the whole of Blackfriars Bridge was proved to be within the City of London.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge, and leave my case to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN KARRENS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What business are you? - A. A hatter, and worked with the prisoner, at Mr. Vaughan's, near the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with him when he met with the prosecutor? - A. I was, and had hold of his arm; it was on Monday night, the 14th of September, about one o'clock, about the middle of Blackfriars-bridge; we had been to the play, and were going straight home, when the prosecutor took hold of the prisoner by the shoulder, and said, you are the man that took my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor drunk or sober at that time? - A. He was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your friend, the prisoner, any opportunity of taking his watch? - A. No, nor did he attempt it; I was surprised at the man making such an assertion, and said, he wanted to quarrel with us; then I desired him to be gone, or I would give him a blow; the prisoner took the prosecutor's hand from his shoulder, and pushed him away, and we passed on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor call out for watch, at the moment he seized the defendant? - A. No; he came up again, upon which I laid my hand on his shoulder, and pushed him off into the middle of the street, seeing he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass any watchman? - A. We walked the usual pace over the Bridge, and passed a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asleep? - A. I don't think so; I saw him in his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the prosecutor have seen him? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he visible? - A. The box was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A.Just at the foot of the Bridge, when we came to turn down John-street, opposite the Leverian Museum, the watchman was standing by his box, and the prosecutor called, watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it there he first spoke to a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here to-night? - A. I believe so; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180068"></xptr>stopped, and the watchman took the prisoner into custody; the prisoner told the prosecutor to take care what he was about, in charging him with taking his watch, and gave charge of the prosecutor, upon which we all went to the watch-house, by the Obelisk, I went voluntarily with my friend; the constable asked whether there was any charge against me; the watchman said, there was not; then the prisoner was searched, but nothing found of the prosecutor's, and I was searched at my own desire.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prosecutor was drunk? - A. Yes, very drunk, perceivable to any person.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Thomas). Q. Is that the man who was with the prisoner? - A. Yes, I believe it is; the prisoner came up to me, and he stood at my right hand.</p>
               <p>Karrens. I never saw the man till he took hold of the prisoner by the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see a watchman in his box, upon your oath? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Thomas. I did not see the box.</p>

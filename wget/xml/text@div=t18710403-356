                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 174, Southwark Bridge Road—on 9th March, at 9.45 in the morning, I was in the Borough, walking along the pavement—I had an umbrella in one hand, and a parcel in the other—just opposite the "Hop Pole" public-house there is a narrow court—as I passed the court White came out, and butted himself against me—I thought it was ah accident, but he instantly seized my chain, and it was gone in an instant, all except the hook that was on the button—I valued it at 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Carter stood at the corner of the court—White ran into the court after he had taken the chain—it was a very narrow court, only room for one to go in at a time—I followed White, and as I passed Carter, he put out his foot, and tripped me up—I fell on my face—I got up, and picked up my hat, and parcel, and umbrella, and still followed after White—the court is about 100 yards long, with a brick wall on each side—when he got to the end of the court I lost sight of him—I went straight to the police-station, and gave information—I was quite sober.</p>

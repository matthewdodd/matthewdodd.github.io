                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller. About nine o'clock on the evening of the 23rd of Aug. I was in Aldgate—I felt a slight twitch, and on turning round saw M'Carthy with my handkerchief in his hand—he was going across the street—I followed and laid hold of him—he threw the hand<lb></lb>kerchief</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 198.) I was in Aldgate about nine o'clock on Friday night, the 23rd—I saw Savage following the prosecutor round the corner of Mr. Moses's new buildings—he went up on tiptoe, got hold of his pocket, went back, and joined M'Carthy and Fitzgerald—I saw him speak to them, but did not hear him—they all three then went on, I sup<lb></lb>pose three or four yards—M'Carthy then rose the tail of his right-hand pocket up, and took the handkerchief out—I cannot say with which hand he rose it up—the gentleman turned round, and they had a scuffle—I crossed over—he threw the handkerchief down—Fitzgerald picked it up, and clapped it between her legs—I took it from her—Savage immediately ran away—I am sure I saw him go up and feel the gentleman's pocket with one of his hands—it was the same pocket—I had seen the three prisoners together before.</p>

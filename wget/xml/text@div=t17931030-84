               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this transaction yourself? - I detected the prisoner taking it; I am a linen draper, she was with another lady that I had been selling some articles to; I saw her take it and put it into her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in company with the other woman? - The other woman bought several things and paid me for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300128"></xptr>them to the amount of seventeen, eighteen, or twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this cambrick? - Eight shillings. I charged her with it and desired her to give it up; she took it off the counter, I was on one side of the counter and she was on the other; I charged her with it and desired her to give it up; she would not, she was searched in the parlour and it was taken from her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a very young woman, I see she came into your shop with Mrs. Sweeting who is a woman of character? - She is, and I believe the young woman's friends are respectable.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that came to you had bought goods three or four times the value of this cambrick? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. This cambrick of course being only a yard and a quarter and three nails, lays within a very narrow compass; you thought you saw her, and perhaps you did see her put it into her pocket, I believe she said at first she had not got it? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you know how it was found? - I did not see it found.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not a common shop lifter that she was with? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see this young woman lay her handkerchief on the counter? - I don't know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I did not search the prisoner, but I was present and saw the cambrick taken from her pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - She seemed very much frightened when it was found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This piece of cambrick is an article that lays in a very small compass; I would ask you whether it might not be enclosed in an handkerchief very innocently by an innocent person? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible? - It is not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. This young lady desired to be searched I believe? - The person that was with her desired she should be searched, to which she made no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. On searching her you found nothing but this cambrick? - No, the person in the room said, let us look at this handkerchief? and opening it the cambrick came out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her an excellent character.</p>

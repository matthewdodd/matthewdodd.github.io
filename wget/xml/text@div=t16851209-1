               High Treason, For Conspiring the Death of the Late King, &amp;c.
            </rs> and the Court not thinking fit to consent to any further delay, put himself upon the Jury, without making any Challenge; and the Kings Council having opened the nature of the Indictment, Mr. Keeling was Sworn, who proved the Plot or Conspiracy in General, how designed and by what means and methods carried on. After which Mr. 
               <persName id="t16851209-1-person29">Tho. Lee</persName>
             was Sworn, and gave Evidence, that he had been sundry times with Mr. Bateman, and that the first time he went to him by Mr. Goodenough's order, and there they discoursed about carrying on the Trayterous design, of which Bateman approved and promised his assistance, and was contented to manage one of the Twenty Parts into which the City was to be divided in order to an Insurrection, it being agreed that 500 men should be raised in each part, to seize the Tower, City, Savoy, Whitehall, and the Persons of the late King and his present Majesty: in order to which he promised to use his Interest. Further Mr. Lee deposed, that he went with him to the late D. of Monmouth's House, and there having discoursed with one of the late Dukes Servants, the said Bateman, told him the said Lee that the late Duke was willing to ingage in the Design before mentioned, and kept several Horses in the Country for that intent, with much more to the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goodenough gave Evidence, that the Prisoner did approve of the design to seize the Tower, City, &amp;c. and then to force the Guards, and seize the Person of the late King, &amp;c. and that it was at a meeting with him, to the best of his remembrance, at the Kings Head in Swithins Alley near the Royal Exchange. Mr. Bateman insisted in defence, how improbable it was that he should discourse so with Lee or Goodenough, unless he were a Mad Man; and called several persons to testifie for his honesty, and one Baker, a Broken person, was upon the request of the Jury, against the opinion of the Court, heard after his Tryal, was over and Lee was gone who testified against Lee, that a little before the Plot was discovered, he would have had him engaged to have talked of State affairs to Bateman and others, and joyn with him, and he would make him a great man. So that after a full and favourable hearing of all he had to offer materially in his own defence, he was found <rs id="t16851209-1-verdict2" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I was at a public-house on Thursday night, the 14th of September—the prisoner was sitting down there when I went in—I had some words with him, and we came to blows in front of the bar—he fell down once or twice, and the last time continued down two or three minutes—he then got up—I thought he was done, and would not fight any more—I stood about three feet from him—he rushed suddenly on me—I halloed out, "Oh, Mr. Newman, he has run a knife through my side"—I did not suspect he was coming at me—I only felt the cut once—it was like the prick of a pin—a policeman came in—I went home, got a light, and went to bed—I examined myself, and found where the knife had gone into my side—I found blood running down the thigh—I called in a policeman, and he ran out, and apprehended the prisoner.</p>

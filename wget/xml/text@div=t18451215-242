                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Andraide, a meat salesman in Newgate-market; we live in Southampton-street, Covent-garden—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service—on Thursday, the 20th of Nov., I heard a noise—the prisoner said she had dropped the pail—I said I did not consider it was so—I followed her into the area, and found a box there—I asked her where she got that box—she said she bought it—I said I was certain she had not got it yesterday, for I was in her room, and there was no box there—I then called my husband—the prisoner said there was nothing of mine in the box—those were her precise words, as near as I can recollect—I told her she should not take the box away till I knew what the contents were—my husband went for a policeman, and she said, in presence of the policeman, that what was in the box belonged to her—I said, "You had better let me see what is in it"—she said she would not, but she would go down upon her knees and swear there was nothing of mine in that box—the policeman also urged her to let me see what was in it—the box was at last opened, and these things were found in it, marked with my name—I have examined them—they are all mine—she afterwards admitted that she took the box out of a front cellar—it was an old candle-box.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 7th of June, while I was sitting at the Golden Anchor door, Saffron-hill, the prisoner came by with a keg, what was in it I cannot tell, he dropped it out of his hand, and swore an oath and said Mr. Langdale owed him twenty pounds, and he was obliged to take that in part. He seemed very drunk; he dropped it at the door.</p>

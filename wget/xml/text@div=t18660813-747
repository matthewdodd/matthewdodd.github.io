                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAMTOPLEY</hi>. I am a wholesale and retail grocer, and live at Woolwich—the prisoner was in my employment about five months, since March last—I engaged him as light porter to take out goods—I authorised him to receive money when the goods were paid for—his duty was to put down on the way-bill which he has with him the amount which he receives, and hand it over to me or my cashier—Mrs. Taylor deals with me—this is the way-bill for the 22nd June—there is an amount of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. charged here to Taylor, Sand Street; that is, he took out goods to that amount, according to this way-bill—I believe he has never paid for that—he has never paid it to me—this is a way-bill dated 19th July, in the name of Mrs. Taylor, for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has never accounted to me for that sum—he has never accounted to me for a further sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mrs. Taylor on the same day—these two amounts were for goods bought at the same time—I have not the way-bill for goods supplied to Mr. Turner on 26th of July, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in this case the way-bill has been destroyed—it was the prisoner's duty to return the way-bill when he came in—in this case he paid my young man 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers, on account of Mr. Turner—my young man told me so—I have never received from him the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of Mr. Turner.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 24th of December last had the Captain ordered you to take the boat, and go with a message to another ship - A. Yes, about four o'clock in the afternoon, it was just dark at that time we pulled round the teer of ships on the Middlesex side by stone stairs, I and my brother were both pulling our oars, against the tide, we met the prisoner in a scull by himself; I told him to go on one side or the other, he made no answer but struck our boat, upon which my brother called him a nasty name; he then hit me upon my right arm; I asked the prisoner why he struck me, it was not me that called him that nasty name; our boat then was alongside of another boat, the prisoner run his boat on the tide, and came near us, he struck my brother on the shoulder, my brother run out into another boat, the prisoner took up the scull stretched it out at arm's length and hit my brother on the back, my brother had a guernsey frock on, it is a wooley thing, he set it against my brother's back. the scull held fast of the frock; the prisoner shoved him overboard, I am sure I saw the prisoner shove him overboard.</p>

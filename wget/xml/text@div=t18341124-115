                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Liverpool-street. The prisoner was in my service about seven months—it was his duty to draw up declara<lb></lb>tions, and act as a confidential clerk—and it was his duty to receive mo<lb></lb>nies for me—I left London about the 30th of August, and gave him in<lb></lb>structions to get in all monies that were due for warrants of attorney and cognovits; and when it amounted to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay it into my ban<lb></lb>ker's—but I afterwards wrote him a letter from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, to pay in all monies to my banker; on leaving town I gave him instructions in a case of "Ratton against Bryan"—he was to take 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and another person's acceptance for the balance; instead of which, he took 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., con<lb></lb>trary to my strict injunction, and an acceptance for the balance—there was an action of "Davis and Newsky," in which a warrant of attorney had been given, and there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on it—I have never received that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I re<lb></lb>turned on the 24th or 25th of September—I met the prisoner in Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street—he said, "I am very ill, I have been attacked with cholera<lb></lb>morbus, but I will not be longer than a quarter of an hour"—I did not see him for three weeks afterwards—I remember being referred to by the pri<lb></lb>soner respecting his lodging in Acorn-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and was employed in an action of "Davis and Newsky."

               <p>"Sir,—I shall not be able to return before the beginning of the week; you will, therefore, inform all persons coming to my office thereof; I shall be in town on Tuesday morning; in the mean time, I trust nothing will occur that will require my personal attendance, otherwise you must endeavour to defer the same until my return. You will get in all the in<lb></lb>stalments that are due, and should you receive any money, pay the same into my banker's, and keep a correct account of the monies paid in; keep the books regularly entered up daily, of every thing that transpires during my absence.</p>
               <p>Yours, &amp;c, Lewis Ratton."</p>

               <p>"Sir,—Whilst I deeply lament the circumstances attending my absence from the duties of my station, I trust the day is not far distant when the reparation due to you will be made; indeed I can no longer bear the agony of this suspense, and unless you shall be satisfied by the payment of what<lb></lb>ever may be the balance appearing due from me, on or before Saturday next, till which day I trust you will suspend any inquiry through the officers you have seen prudent to employ. I will on Monday morning personally wait upon you, and after entering into the fullest explanation, which I now much regret I had not done earlier, leave myself in your hands."</p>

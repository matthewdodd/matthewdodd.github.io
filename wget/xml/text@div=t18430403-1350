I was the consignee of these carrots—the three prisoners have occasionally worked for me, but not on the 15th of March—they had no authority to go to the wharf and take these four sacks of carrots—there were some refuse in another sack—they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Slater came to me for money the day before—he said there were a few rotten carrots in the vessel, which the captain said he might have—I said they were not the captain's to give away, if they were rotten they ought to be thrown, away, but being consigned to me, they ought to be put on shore—I told him at his peril to take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in Long-lane. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 15th of March, I went to the Black Lion Wharf to cart away some carrots of Davis's—I saw the prisoners there between eight and nine—Slater said, "These are the sacks you can have for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there were two sacks and a half of carrots, and one sack of refuse—I went away, and said I would not give more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my porter came to me, and said, "Give me the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I bought them—I asked Davis's man to cart them with the car<lb></lb>rots I bought of Mr. Davis—he said he would not—Buxton and Walsh were on the wharf—Slater said the captain gave them to them for clearing out the vessel—Buxton and Walsh loaded them into my cart, and Slater sold them to me, and took the money—they weighed rather better than 300 cwt. and a half.</p>

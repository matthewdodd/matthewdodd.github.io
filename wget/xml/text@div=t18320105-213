            . I am a pupil of the London-hospital. The deceased was brought to the hospital on the 12th of December, about ten minutes past eight o'clock; I found a deep lacerated wound on his left cheek, about two inches and a half long: the cheek bone was laid bare, and a branch of the temporal artery had been divided, which bled profusely - I should consider it was an instrument of this kind which made the wound: there was a contused wound on the bead, such as might have been inflicted by a more blunt piece of wood; several of his teeth were loose, as if he had received a blow from a man's fist - he was between sixty and seventy years of age: I stopped the haemorrhage - it had been dressed before, but not sufficiently to stop it; he died on the 2nd of January - Mr. Scott, the surgeon, superintended my management of him; he had every thing done that the nature of the ease required - had he been a young man he might have been saved; I think the wounds were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you believe the cause of his death was a wound produced by an instrument of this description? A. I should think the wound on his cheek was from a blow, with the sharp edge of this piece of wood - I think it could not have been produced by falling, unless he had fallen on a scraper, or something of that kind.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had been attacked in Petticoat-lane by several Jews, who surrounded and robbed him; and the deceased must have fallen, in his endeavouring to get from them, but he had not struck him.</p>

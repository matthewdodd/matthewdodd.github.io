A person came in and bought something that came to three pence, and gave him a shilling; he took out three pence from the till, then he threw the shilling into the till, he put his hand into the till to get a sixpence; he had his hand in the till a considerable time; I thought he was taking money, he took the sixpence between his forefinger and thumb, and when he took his hand out of the till I very plainly could see that he had something under his back fingers and the palm of his hand; I was in the staircase that leads from the shop to the cellar; there was a cavity that I had a view of the till and the greater part of the shop. When the woman went away he began cleaning my boots, he took the brush in his hand, and then I perceived he did not open his back fingers; I pushed the door open, I said, Philip, what have you got in your hand, he said nothing; I took the brush out of his hand; he opened his hand and then said I have got two shillings; I told him he was a pretty fellow, his wages was not enough, he must rob me every opportunity; he denied it, said he was a going to put it in the till, and behaved insolent; I went for an officer; he searched him and found a shilling on him that I had marked; I thought he did not come honestly by the money, because I had not paid him any wages since he had been with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the money that was marked. - A. In the till. The next morning the officer brought him to my house; in his way to Worship street, the prisoner said he hoped I would forgive him, he would give up all his wages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How many shillings had you marked. - A. Twenty, I dare say, in the same way with a cross.</p>

            , I went with him to a place called Corkcutters-alley; as soon as I got into the alley, it is not a thoroughfare, a woman ran up the alley, and said, Jack, shut the door; I made the best of my way to follow her into that house, and I found the prisoner standing in the house with his back towards the fire-place; when he saw me, he stooped to take up something, which he held behind his coat, which put me on my guard; the woman then ran towards him, put her arms round him, and took something away, but what it was I could not discover; he then stooped again, and took something else up, which he held behind his coat in the same way; after a little while that was dropped, and I discovered a poker lying upon the hearth; he asked me what I wanted with him, and it was nonsense, and so on; I then desired the watchman to take him into custody, and I took out my truncheon, and we took him to the watch-house; when he came to the watch-house, I searched him, and in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket I found four Ramsgate bank-notes, which I have now to produce; they were squeezed up separately like waste paper; I did not ask him how he came by them, he was drunk at that time; the next morning I did ask him how he came by them, and he told me he came honestly by them, but did not tell me how. (Produces three five-guinea notes, and a ten pound note.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibson. I believe them all to be mine; but the ten pound note, which is marked with, the names of Mr. Heritage and J. Perkins upon it, I can swear positively to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You mean only to speak to the ten pound note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that single circumstance, of having these names upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They are all Ramsgate bank-notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing is more common with notes than to have names endorsed upon them? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>Q. It appears to have been a good while in circulation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect ever having seen the names of Heritage and Perkins upon any other note? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Heritage kept a tavern at Ramsgate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was his practice to put his name upon other bills? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see any other notes with his names endorsed upon them? - A. I may; I cannot recollect them.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing there had been a ten pound note that had found its way to York, or any other place, it having the name of Heritage, and having the name of Perkins, should you have been able to distinguish the one from the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the endorsement, Heritage, is dated May 1795? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Observe this is not the endorsement of an endorset, because it is payable on demand, but an endorsement put on for some other purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Bly. Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The first person you saw at the end of this alley was the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of the notes in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was the person who appeared to be agitated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you curiosity to search the house before you took the prisoner to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore, whether there was any other man in that house you do not know? - A. It is a small house let in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the house to see if there was any other man in any other part of that house at that time? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner make any resistance when you took him? - A. He seemed to menace at first, but he did not make any resistance.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You say there was a woman whose arms were round the man, what became of her? - A. She was taken into custody a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it impossible that she could have taken any thing from his pocket, or any part about him? - A. I think there was a possibility, but I did not see her take any thing; he back was to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Might not the woman have given him something? - A. I did not see her; there is a possibility of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could she have given him these notes that you found squeezed up in his waistcoat pocket? - A. I should suppose she might.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us all that passed about the woman? - A. No; she went to him when he stood by the fire-place, and took something out of his hand, but what it was I do not know, she made use of this expression,"Don't, don't, do nothing;" she put her hands to his hands, and whatever he had in his hands, he dropped; I did not know whether it was the poker, or what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us all that happened that the woman did? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the woman clasping the man round the body, with her arms? - A. Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If that had been done in the room, you must have seen it? - A. Yes, there was a light in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he gave her any thing, or that she gave him any thing? - A. I did not see her either give or take.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that she did not give any thing into his hand? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrole: On the 3d of April, I went with the last witness into the prisoner's apartment, he was there along with the woman; I heard the prisoner say to Gentleman, that he would let him have fifteen or twenty pounds, if he wanted it, and not to be afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gentleman and he making a notice and riotous? - A. Yes, and beating the man.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Bly.) Q. Was it in consequence of what Greenhill told you, respecting the prisoner having fifteen or twenty pounds, that you proceeded to do what you did? - A. Yes; Gentleman was a man that had returned from transportation, and therefore I suspected the prisoner as they were together.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Pemberton.) Q. You say, you observed a footstep when you went up stairs, was it a man's footstep or a woman's? - A. A man's.</p>

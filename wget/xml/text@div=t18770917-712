                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 27th July I received a warrant for the arrest of W. T. Gallagher, Edward Gallagher, and A. Gallagher—on 4th August I saw Edward at Bow Lane station, I said "I am a detective sergeant and hold a warrant for your arrest," which I read to him, and asked him if he was the person referred to in it as "A. Gallagher"—he said "Yes" he said that he ordered the musical box for his brother to be sent to 10, Silver Street, Golden Square—he was detained in custody, and on Sunday morning I examined his coat and found on the loop the name of Charrick—I asked him to account for where he got the clothes; he declined to do so—I searched him and found on him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a key, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some memoranda—I afterwards took William Gallagher; I told him I had a warrant for his arrest, I read it to him, and when I got to the words "Cheat and defraud," he said "I did not intend to defraud"—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a Bank of Ireland note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a silver watch, and a gold chain—he gave his address 17, Princes Street, but I found he was not known there; I went with Trafford to make inquiries—I then went to Stanford Street, and saw Mrs. Morgan, who showed me a room on the third floor, where I found the musical box under the bed—I then went to Charlotte Street and saw McCarthy; I opened the shop with the key found on Edward Gallagher, and found in it these hams, cheeses, and a firkin of butter, which were afterwards identified.</p>

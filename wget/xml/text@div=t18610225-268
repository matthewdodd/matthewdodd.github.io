                  </hi>. I am the wife of George White, who keeps the Woodstock Arms beer-house, in West Ham, Essex—on the afternoon of 8th February, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon, the prisoner came with a decanter and wanted half a pint of gin—I told him we were not licensed to sell spirits—he said he would not give any trouble, he would have a glass of ale—he then put down this half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in payment—I gave him the change—he went out immediately—I took the half-crown into the parlour to my husband—in consequence of what took place in the parlour, after looking at the half-crown, I went and looked after the prisoner—I went to the next public-house, the Walmer Castle—that was about five minutes after—a witness named Bond went there with me—I saw Bond take hold of him, and; take a half-crown out of his hand—he was brought back to my husband's house, and a policeman was sent for—I marked the half-crowns that I showed to my husband.</p>

I keep the Woodstock Arms beer-house, West Ham—on 8th February, I saw the prisoner in my shop, and heard him ask my wife for some gin—soon after that she brought me a half-crown into the parlour—I went out, tried it with a detector, and found it was bad—I was at home when the prisoner was brought back in custody—I saw one half-crown taken from him, and then two more—I have since found that they were all bad.</p>

I am a general shopkeeper at 1, Swancombe-street, Plais<lb></lb>tow, Essex—on 28th February I went into White's beer-shop—I saw the prisoner there—I went out leaving him there—shortly after I had left, Mr. White came to me—in consequence of what he said, I went in search of the prisoner—I found him at the Walmer Castle public-house, which is near by—I said, "You have passed a counterfeit half-crown at Mr. White's"—he said, "Where is that?"—he then ran to the door as though he wanted to know where Mr. White's was—I brought him back—when he found that Mr. White was determined to send for a policeman, I found him trying to shift some money out of one of his hands—I caught hold of him and took from his hand one bad half-crown, a shilling, and sixpence in good silver, and some coppers—I turned round to give directions to a little girl to go a different way for a policeman, and when I turned round again I saw his hand between the blind and the window—I ran forwards, threw him down, and took these two bad half-crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his hand—I marked them—a policeman came and he was given into custody.</p>

               <p>Are you a house-keeper? - No, not now; I have been.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - No; I never saw her before last Tuesday was week, which was the 2d of May, at about six o'clock. I asked which was the nearest way to an acquaintance's of mine. I was coming from an acquaintance's in Long-Acre, it was about six in the morning.</p>
               <p>What business had you in Long-Acre at that early hour in the morning? - I was out of town the day before with a friend of mine, and I had lain in Long-Acre all night.</p>
               <p>What is your friend's name? - Mrs. Mayes, who is a millener in Long-Acre.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - I am a <rs id="t17800510-35-viclabel190" type="occupation">millener</rs>

The prisoner swore she would have money or else my heart I said I would not give her any; upon that she took hold of me behind, and took my cane out of my hand, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Did you walk with a cane? - Yes. I had a riding dress on; the prisoner took hold of my cane, the other took me behind by my hair, and another took me by the collar.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cane was it you rode with? - It cost eight shillings and sixpence, my own name was upon it; it was about the size, I suppose, of my little finger.</p>
               <p>How came they to knock you down? - With the violence they used, I suppose; I can declare solemnly upon my oath that while one held me down the prisoner took my breast buckle out of my shirt and my braid from behind my hair.</p>
               <p>Was that breast buckle set with garnets? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Did you lose a ring? - Yes, and two halfcrowns out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner take the ring? - I cannot say which of the three took it when they had me down, but I can safely swear she took my breast buckle out.</p>
               <p>Where had you been dressed up in this manner? - I had been down to the forest to see my two children.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100047"></xptr>What are you a married woman? - Not now, I have been; I am a widow; I work hard for my living.</p>
               <p>What was your husband? - A seafaring man.</p>
               <p>Where had you been to dressed in this manner? - Upon Epping Forest to Little Illford quite entirely through the forest.</p>
               <p>Was your friend a male or a female? - A female.</p>
               <p>Did you travel on horseback or in a phaeton? - I went and came in the stage to Illford, the rest I walked.</p>
               <p>I suppose Covent Garden was full of people; the market begins at four in the morning; there must have been five hundred people in the market at that time? - I saw nobody but a parcel of men, who I suppose belonged to her; I had met them before; they had even broke the teeth in my head and cut me without mercy; I never set my eyes upon her before; it was because I would not give her money to drink.</p>
               <p>And you saw nobody but those men you took to be accomplices with this woman? - None.</p>
               <p>In What part of the piazzas was it? - This end of the piazzas.</p>
               <p>On what day? - A Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Jury. Tuesday is a market morning, there are five hundred people about at that time? - I came right through the little piazzas into the great piazzas.</p>
               <p>You came down James-street, did not you? - I cannot really say, I do not know much of Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Which way did you come from Long-acre? - Just by the coachmaker's.</p>
               <p>Where was you going? - I was going home.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you been in bed all night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With Mrs. Mayes? - With her maid servant.</p>
               <p>Was the ring on your finger? - Yes, and plumes of feathers in my hat, and a band and loop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear it was me that knocked you down and took the breast-buckle out of your breast?</p>
               <p>White. Yes you did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 2d of May this girl came to the office, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Which girl? - The last witness, I call her a girl. She came for a warrant against some people for beating her and robbing her of the things mentioned in the indictment. She did not know the name of either of them, so no warrant could be granted.</p>
               <p>Did she apply for a warrant against one or two? - For three. I saw she was very bad, her eye was swelled up prodigiously and very black. She said she had been so treated by three girls. She described them. She said she must have a warrant. I desired her to go home and take care of her eye. I thought she was drunk by her appearance.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning might it be? - About seven in the morning. I heard no more of it till the Friday following. It was then my watch-night. She brought a girl at night charged by the watch, into the round-house, and said this was one of the girls who had ill-used her.</p>
               <p>Was that person the prisoner? - No. I kept her all night, as a night charge; I had her before a magistrate in the morning. The prosecutrix said that was not the girl who robbed her, but that she was one who had struck her. The justice asked her if she knew who it was that had robbed her; she said yes, and if the justice would give leave, she would go with the constable and shew where to find them. I went with her into Dyot-street, there I found the prisoner; I asked the prisoner what she had done with the braid or bit of hair, she took from the girl's head; she said she had sold it to a barber in Drury-lane, for six-pence, and would shew me the barber's; she accordingly went and shewed me.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutrix give you any reason for the suspicion, she had of the prisoner or give you any information how she had found her out? - No, it was by the other girl who was taken that the information was got.</p>
               <p>Did she charge the woman she brought the night before? - She said she was one of those who used her ill, but she was not the person who robbed her; the other girl when she came before the magistrate said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100048"></xptr>would shew who the person was that robbed her.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Was the woman you brought to the watch-house one of the three women who attacked you? - Yes. She held me down, while they stamped upon me.</p>

               <p>I am a barber. I live at No. 5, Drury-lane. I bought this braid (producing it) of the prisoner for sixpence.</p>

               <p>I met this young woman at the corner of the great piazzas; she was talking to a young man. Another young woman who was along with me, went up to her and asked her for something to drink; she lifted up her cane, and hit the young woman on the head with it. I asked her what that was for, she hit me. Then she went into the piazzas, took off her hat, and gave it a man to hold while she fought me. When she found she could not get the upper hand of me, she got a chairman to beat me, who knocked me down in the high road and would have killed me, I suppose, if people had not come up. I have neither father nor mother.</p>

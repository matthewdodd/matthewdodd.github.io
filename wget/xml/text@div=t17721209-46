I was coming to town from Barnet on Thursday the 5th of November; we were rather late, having been detained from want of a chaise at Barnet, when I came near <placeName id="t17721209-46-crimeloc249">Tottenham court turnpike</placeName>

Almost instantly after the pistol was fired a man opened the door, and demanded our money; I desired them to be civil as a lady in the chaise was much intimidated, as indeed all of us were, and we would give him what we had; we gave him what little we had made up in our purses, as it was late, with a view to the event. He went off, and carried away what he had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the person?</p>
               <p>Dodd. No; I cannot say this was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what you gave him?</p>
               <p>Dodd. Some silver first; afterwards a little green purse I had made up with I believe two guineas and some silver in it; it was about that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090027"></xptr> amount; there was also in the purse a note of exchange for 10 l. which he also took. The violence and mode of the attack is the only reason I appear against him: had he robbed me in the usual way, I should not have appeared against him; but the horrid method of attack made me think it necessary to publick justice to appear against him. I went immediately to Sir

            , and shewed the manner in which the chaise had been broke. What the pistol was loaded with I cannot say. The prisoner is the man that fired the pistol and took our money; what are become of the others I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dodd. I think so, though I cannot be so certain; I was on the opposite side of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dodd. That young man stopped us within a very little way of Tottenham-road turnpike. I saw him cock the pistol and let it off; he behaved civil after he had opened the door. I am certain he is the person that fired.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain you know him?</p>
               <p>Dodd. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure of the man?</p>
               <p>Dodd. Yes, I am; he was very particular in the robbery, which made me take notice of him; he stood by the wheel of the chaise before he shot, for I was not so much frightened then, having never met with an accident of the kind, and did not suspect robbery.</p>

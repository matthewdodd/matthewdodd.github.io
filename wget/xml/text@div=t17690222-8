            . On the 17th of February, in the afternoon, about half an hour after four, I was in Cheapside: going towards Cheapside-Conduit, a little before I got to <placeName id="t17690222-8-crimeloc47">Woodstreet</placeName>

I saw no body near me but him: I said, Friend, you have picked my pocket, and took hold of him; he fell a crying, and begged I would let him go, and said he had not. I took him into an alley. A gentleman came to know what was the matter. Somebody went for a constable. In the interim the prisoner dropt my handkerchief in the channel, in the dirt. It was picked up and delivered to the constable. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

                  </hi>. My name was Charlotte Gill.

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I have been in the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's service two years—on the day the prisoner left I had got up about half-past seven o'clock—the prisoner and I generally got up together—I do not recollect which got up first—I turned up the bed in the prisoner's presence, before he was out of the shop, and before the shop was opened—I always made the bed and turned it up—I did not then see any pocket-book, or any articles in it—they might have been between the bed and the sacking, and I not have seen them—about two months previous, the pri<lb></lb>soner told me he had lost a pocket-book, and if I found it, to give it to him—he did not mention it again till the morning of the day he went away—hi said he had something in it that he would not lose, and he could not get some little affairs settled till he found it—I had never seen the pocket-book—I had slept in that bed every night, and I had turned it down the preceding night—I turned the bed over the night the pocket-book fell out—I had not turned it over for about a week before—on this night I heard something—I turned round, and it was the pocket-book—Mr. Barnett was there—I gave it him directly, and the parcel—some time before I had seen the prisoner writing on a card.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the same thing by turning the bed-stead down as turning it over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bedstead folds up together in the middle, something like a book—there is no mattrass—the bed shuts up in the bedstead—it does not shut flat down together—there are hinges in the middle—when I turn it down I pull it from under the counter—on that right I turned the flap over a little, and then pulled it out—the bed did not come with it, and at that time these articles slipped out—according to my notion, they must have been between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the prisoner left, you had seen him writing on a card? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this card found in the pocket-book is the card, or one similar to it—I saw him drawing some lines on it, and I recollect the name of Corby being on one side of it, as it is on this—I saw him take it out of a krger pocket-book—I never had it in my hand till it was taken out of the Pocket-book—I know this writing on it is the prisoner's—I saw this card about a month before the 5th of Feb.</p>

               <p>and before the prisoner came—I found no deficiency—the stock was all right—Bosworth and the prisoner slept in the bed in the shop—it was the prisoner's duty to superintend the business, to take in pledges, and when pledges were redeemed he was to put the money into the till, and the du<lb></lb>plicates which he received—we always had the ticket crossed out in the book before eight o'clock at night—I have my books here—here are the duplicates of Moy and of Banger, which is in the name of Cooper—I have not the duplicate in the name of Gill—these duplicates are not crossed out in the book—it was the prisoner's duty to have done so—here is in the book a pawning on the 7th Dec, which is not crossed out—if this article had been redeemed on the 5th of Feb. it ought to have been crossed out—I was present when this pocket-book was found—I found this card in it, which is in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had Bosworth anything to do with the books or the pledges? No—not with taking the pledges or entering them—he was kept in the warehouse—he had no duties to perform in the shop—I took stock on the Sunday before the prisoner came, or on the Sunday week, and all was correct then—the prisoner knew he was to leave on the 5th of Feb., three weeks before.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was there any direction upon them? - No, I have opened them and examined them, and there appeared to be 30 s. wrote on them (a few of the half-pence handed to the Jury) the dies I found in the press, and this half penny I found in the die, there is no connection between the houses; I went up stairs, I said pray Mr. Weatherby where do you get them half-pence, says he, I had them from the people next door, I went and broke the street door open which faces the street, and went in, and there I found Mrs. Wild in the front parlour standing up near the fire place, she had a bed gown on, such as women work in, there was nothing particular in her dress, I did not take much notice of her, I left her with M'Donald, I asked her for the key of the back parlour, she said she had not got it, this was about one in the morning, I looked round and found they key laying on the chimney piece, and I took it off and opened the door, in the back parlour I found a cutting press, a quantity of half-pence laying round the press, and a stamping press with the dies fixed and that halfpenny between the dies, and a quantity of half-pence laying round the press, and some cesil laying by the side of the cutting press in the back parlour, and some blanks, and a bag hung up in which they shake the half-pence to make them black; (Produced) there are a great many flaws in the head of the die and so are the half-pence, I went up stairs in the one pair of stairs back room, and I found Mr. Hasbridge and his wife in bed.</p>
               <p>Did you find every thing complete for coining? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was on the fire? - A little hot water, I desired Mr. Hasbridge to get up which he did, he had a very dirty shirt on, a pair of breeches lay by the feet of the bed all over dirt and grease, when he got up he put a clean shirt on, and clean breeches, his hands appeared to be dirty and so did his wife's; I then brought him down stairs, and went into Mrs. Wild's appartments, for she went to lock up her clothes, there I found these half-pence, and a quantity of half-pence besides, and a quantity of cecil and some blanks in that room; and in the room that she carried me for her things; two or three young men in bed and another lad in a closet, they were brought to the office and discharged; I have frequently remarked it when I have apprehended such sort of people, it has appeared by the smell of their clothes, what sort of business they had been about, for they use a great deal of b rimstone in the colouring of half-pence, that made me think so here, for his hands were all over dirt.</p>
               <p>What kind of dirt? - Why such dirt as would come to any body from handling such half-pence as these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hasbridge. I had washed myself before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wild. You say there stood a saucepan on the fire? - I said it was a copper pot.</p>

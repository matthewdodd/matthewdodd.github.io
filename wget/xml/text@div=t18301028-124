            . I am a Police-officer. On the 20th of September, I saw the prisoner in Homer-street, with this stock and bit under his coat - I thought he was a carpenter; I had not been gone three minutes, when a man who buys and sells these articles came to me - I went into a public-house, and saw the prisoner with it; I asked if it was his - he said he had it to sell for an old feeble man named Plant; I went with him to Plant's house, and waited till he came home - he said he bought it in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is Plant here? A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EDWIN BRADSHAW. This is my stock and bit- I lost them from a house we were repairing in <placeName id="t18301028-124-crimeloc696">Maddox-street</placeName>

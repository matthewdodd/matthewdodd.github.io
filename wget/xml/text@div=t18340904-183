               <p>Thomas's Defence. On Monday, the 28th of July, I got from my bed between six and seven o'clock - as I was going up Holborn I met a gentleman who asked me to take care of the property for him - he took me into a public-house for a glass of ale, and said he would not be long before he came back; and he accordingly came back, but during his absence, he sent a man to me to give him half a dozen of spoons, so I did - he then looked and took a quantity of things out and got them pawned, and then gave me the duplicates - after a short time he said the things belonged to his wife, who had taken away his best clothes, and a great deal of money, and as these things belonged to his wife, he should make away with them - he pawned every thing, and brought me the duplicates - I saw Ellen Sulivan about twelve o'clock, and asked her to have something to drink - she asked what property I had there - I told her a gentleman left them in my care, who said he would not be long before he came back, and he wanted them pawned - I asked her to stop into that public-house, while I went to look for the gentleman - I came back and did not see him - I gave her the duplicates in that cap to take care of for me - she cannot read, and she took them home to her sister Mary Ann, who took them - it was her sister's cap - she put it on her head - I did not pawn the spoons, and do not know who did - the man gave me the duplicates after pawning them.</p>
               <p>Ellen Sulivan's Defence. I met Thomas, as he has stated - he gave me the duplicates to mind - not being able to read, I did not know what they were - I put them on the mantel-piece - my sister Mary Ann took them up, and put the cap on her head.</p>
               <p>Mary Ann Sulivan's Defence. The policeman asked if I had a pocket on - I said, "Yes" - he then asked what I had in it - I said, "Duplicates;" and that some of them belonged to my sister, and some to myself.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GAHAGAN. I live in this house, and am the landlady - other persons lodge with me - It was alarmed by the sound of a foot coming up stairs, about a quarter past four o'clock - it appeared to stop in the passage - I had no reason to think they had gone into the room, not hearing a door open - I was alarmed - it was light then - I heard a man's foot going down stairs - I got the key of the prosecutor's room door, from where it hung, and saw a man going down with a bundle and a box - I ran after him - he much resembled the male prisoner - it was like him by his back appearance.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOSTON re-examined. The property was taken from the first floor front room - I do not know at what time it was opened - the value of the property lost is about 15l.</p>

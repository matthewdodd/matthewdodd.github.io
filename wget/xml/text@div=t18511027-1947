                  </hi>. I am a lodging-house keeper, at Bath. On 3rd Oct. I went to Romford, in Essex, to collect some small rents—when I left Rom<lb></lb>ford I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in my fob-pocket—there were some half-sovereigns, and I had some silver in my waistcoat-pocket for temporary use—I went by the omnibus from Romford to 11 ford, got down there, and walked on towards London—I came to the neighbourhood of the Coach and Horses—it was then between 7 and 8 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—I got into his company—I thought him to be an honest man, but I found him to be a rogue—he folded me round, and pressed me—he stifled me, prevented me from calling—he took away my seven sovereigns and my watch—I went to the Coach and Horses, and my watch guard was on my neck—I described the prisoner, and he was brought in—I swear to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it after you had been in the Coach and Horses, that the prisoner was brought in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps it might have been an hour after he had done me in that manner—I used to live in Hare-street, Romford, where these houses are, forty years ago—I did not know the prisoner before, but I identify him as the man that robbed me—I am well known—I used to live near Mr. Horbell's, the horse-dealer—I got down at Ilford, because I did not choose to go any further—I waited there to be robbed—it was my pleasure to get down from the omnibus, and I did so—I got down about 4 o'clock—I cannot say whether I paid the omnibus man—I did not search about my pockets, and tell him I could not find any money to pay him—I had got plenty of money in my pocket—I believe I did not pay—Romford is about six miles from Ilford.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you would get there about 5 o'clock; what did you do with yourself till between 7 and 8? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not go out of my way—I did not go after any women—I did not go after any men—I had a quarter of a pound of tea with me that I had bought at Scoobridge—I lost that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go on a brick cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you think I look like a brick<lb></lb>cart man: upon my word I cannot talk to you any longer—I went on a brick cart, dear me!—I lost my diary—my pockets are so shallow I cannot keep things in them, and I could not keep my money—I lost my tea at the same time I lost my watch—my coat did not go too—I went into the Rabbits and the Coach and Horses, and I believe I went into the Son—I cannot tell whether it was on the Ilford or the London side of the Rabbits that this man so ill-treated me—it was dark—I was not taken, I went with the policeman certainly—I was at the station that night; I could not get a bed—I have never been in custody in my life—I do not know whether I was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next morning for the state in which I had been the over night—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer's labourer, and live at 11 ford. On the evening of 3rd Oct. I was near the Coach and Horses, between half-past 8 and 9 o'clock—I saw the last witness in the road near the Coach and Horses—I saw the prisoner, I had not known him before—it was not quite dark—there are not many lamps about there—I took hold of Mr. Martin's arm, and was leading him along—I led him a little way, and the prisoner overtook us—he put his hand in Mr. Martin's pocket, and pulled out some<lb></lb>thing; I cannot tell what—he walked on—I followed him, and told the policeman—I saw Mr. Martin go to the Coach and Horses—the prisoner was brought to the Coach and Horses in about a quarter of an hour—I did not go with the policeman—he told me to stand against a lamp-post, and he would bring him back, and he came back with him to where I was—then I went to the Coach and Horses—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been with Mr. Martin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five minutes—I had hold of his arm—I first met with him just before you come to Ilford Gaol, not much above 100 yards from the Rabbits—I took hold of his arm because he was very drunk—I asked him where he was going, and he could not answer me—his trowsers were undone, and were hanging about him—he was down lying on the ground, and there were two females there, who said, "For God's sake assist this man, or he will be robbed"—it was five or ten minutes after that before I saw the prisoner—Mr. Martin was trying to get up, and I took hold of him—the two women left, and came towards Stratford—I did not know them before—they said nothing to me—there were two more persons along with me, but they went away, and would have nothing to do with it—Mr. Martin buttoned up his clothes, as well as he could, in going along—when I went after the prisoner I passed the gaol and the police-station—I did not stop there; I still followed him about 100 yards—I went a little farther than the Lion—I did not speak to him when I got to the Lion—I did not go up to him opposite the Lion and ask him to stand something—I said, "Have you got the money?" and he thing—I did not say, "Come, old fellow, have you got the money?"—I said, "Have you got the money?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he had got it, I would have gone to the police-station—I had a suspicion that he had money from his putting his hand in his pocket—I swear I did not remain in his company for an hour—I cannot say whether it was half an hour—it was about a quarter of an hour—before I went down to that part I lived at the Plough, in Mile End-road—I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman K,</hi> 250). About 9 o'clock on 3rd Oct. I received information, and apprehended the prisoner—I told him I suspected he had robbed a man opposite the Coach and Horses—he denied it—he said he did not know anything about it—I conveyed him to the Coach and Horses, where the prosecutor was sitting in the parlour—he identified the prisoner as the man who robbed him—I searched the prisoner, and found in his coat pocket six sovereigns and a half sovereign, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 31/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Whose money is this?"—he said, "It belongs to that man sitting there" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prosecutor</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were in your police dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner produced the money, and he said, "It is that man's money"—when he was at the station he took out a piece of paper, and said that was the paper in which the money was wrapped—he said at the station that he found it on the ground—I have heard nothing of two women, of a watch, a quantity of tea, or a memorandum-book—it was at Little Ilford-street that Thompson came to me—to get there the prisoner would have to pass the police-station—there is a lamp there, but it was not lighted—there are generally policemen about there—the prisoner was taken near the Lion—between the gaol and the Lion—I did not know the prosecutor or the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prosecutor drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next day. I took the prisoner about half a mile from the Coach and Horses, in the direction of Romford—Thompson gave me information and I said there was a man gone on, and I had noticed him going, and I ran and took him—Thompson followed him, but I overtook the prisoner before Thompson came up, and had got him in custody—when I took him he was still going on towards Romford, walking very fast—I did not see him and Thompson together—the prisoner had passed me about twenty yards when Thompson came and gave me the information; and it was in consequence of that I followed the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On 21st Nov. I was coming out of the Jolly Sailors public-house, in St. George's in the East—I met the prisoner; I had not known him before—he struck me, I do not know what with—I was not drunk; I do not know whether he was—nothing had taken place first—I walked on and he followed me, and stabbed me with a knife under my left eye—I was knocked stupid—I saw the shine of the knife coming, before I was struck—I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with M'Kay, at the Jolly Sailors—when we came out, three coloured men were walking past the door—the prisoner was one—one of them laid hold of M'Kay, and the prisoner struck him</p>

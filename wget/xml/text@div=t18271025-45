            . I work at bristling stocks; I was fifteen years old last month - I am servant to Mr. Wise, a tailor, Castle-court, Birchin-lane - I have been two years with him: my father lives at No. 7, Fish-street-hill, and works at a bottle warehouse - I asleep at my master's private house, at Stoke Newington, and dine at my father's. On the 21st of September, about a quarter to five o'clock, I was going on an errand to Silver-street, Wood-street, and met the prisoner in Bartholomew-lane; he said, "My lad, will you go to No. 62 round this street here, and get me change for this cheque, in notes and sovereigns?" he said, "There is 6d. for yourself," which he gave me - he said nothing more; I went and got change for the cheque, in 100l. and a 20l. note - I was detained there five or ten minutes: when I came out I went to Bartholomew-lane, expecting to see the prisoner, as I had left him there, but he was gone: I waited about five minutes in the lane, and then went on my errand to Silver-street; I did not see my father till about two o'clock next day - I had not mentioned the matter to any body before I saw him; I gave him the two notes, which I had kept in my waistcoat pocket all the time; I told him how I came by them, and left them with him; I looked about to see if any bills were posted up, as my father ordered me, but did not see any. I saw the prisoner in a small room at the Mansion-house, about a week afterwards - it was three or four days before I was first examined as a witness - two persons were in the same room; I cannot say whether they were prisoners: I went to see if I knew any body there, and I knew the prisoner: I had before that described him to Mr. Gates, the solicitor, and his clerk, the night the officers came to me - I am certain he is the person; I presented the cheque at Grote and Prescott's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went to the Mansion-house, were you not told if you went into that room you would see the person who gave you the cheque? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you was told so? A. Yes, Sir - No, Sir. I have said that Mr. Gates told me it was thought it was the person, by the description I gave of him; one of the persons in the room was an officer, who had been to me at Newington - I do not know the other; he was short, and older than the prisoner: I can read - I saw the name of Evans at the bottom of the cheque, just as I opened it to give it to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Silver-street; do Campbell and Stewart live there? A. Campbell does; I saw him, but did not tell him of my having the money - I saw my master when I went to Newington to sleep; I did not tell him that night, nor in the morning; I carried the money in my pocket to Newington; there are two persons employed at my master's town house - I did not tell them or any body of it till I saw my father; I did not know the prisoner before - I thought it extraordinary, but did not go to the banker's to mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you ever said to any body that you did not know, or did not think you should know, the person who gave you the cheque? A. No; I said so at first to Mr. Gates, the solicitor, and I told my master I thought I should not know the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How come you to be so confident now, when the very day or two after it happened you said you should not know him? A. Why, his complexion, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not the only fair man in the kingdom? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you not said to Stewart that you should not know him, for you were in such a hurry you did not look in his face? A. No, I do not know Stewart; I know the young man who lives with Campbell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to that young man, that the bankers had promised to give you money if the prisoner was convicted, and that you were determined to hang him? A. No, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say the bankers would not give you any money before the trial, but they would afterwards, and you were determined to have a good tuck-out on the day of trial? A. No, nor any thing of the kind; I have talked to Campbell about it, in the presence the person who lodges with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that if the bankers had given you all money, or notes and money, you would have kept the money and destroyed the notes? A. No, Sir. I have seen Campbell here this morning, and the person who lodges with him, and spoken to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them this very morning you hoped they were not here, to tell what they heard you say? A. No - I said, "Have you come to say what I told you?"</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you tell them then? A. I told them the circumstance of Gunson giving me the cheque - that is all.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know Sullivan and Bryan? A. Yes; Sullivan is a journeyman tailor, in Mr. Wise's service, and Bryan is his apprentice; I told them I did not know that I should know the man; I did not tell them that I was determined to hang the prisoner; I said he deserved hanging - that was after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would be d-d if you would not hang him? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK (on the part of the prosecution) here stated, that having no one to confirm the testimony of this witness, he begged to withdraw from the prosecution.</p>

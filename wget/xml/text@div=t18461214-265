I saw the prisoner go home with Warren—I saw her return about three o'clock in the afternoon—I said, "You are going home?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You have been home with Mr. Warren?"—she said, "Yes"—she asked me if I would go and have some gin—I went, and as we were coming out of the house her shawl hung in the hook of the door—I caught up her shawl and said, "Have you torn your shawl?"—she said, "No," and then I saw she had this shawl on under her own—I knew it, and that it belonged to Mr. Warren's daughter—I had seen two of them wear it—I then went to Mr. Warren's house—I found the door open and he was asleep—I awoke him and spoke to him—I looked behind the door and found the shawl was gone—this is it, and it is the one I saw the prisoner with.</p>

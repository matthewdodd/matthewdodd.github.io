             (police-constable B 59). I was on duty, on the night of the 8th of October, at the corner of <placeName id="t18341016-128-crimeloc687">William-street, Knightsbridge</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a night was it? A. A pleasant night - I think the moon had gone down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any thing on the prisoner? A. This jemmy and a dark lantern, and these pick-lock keys - one of them opens Mr. Richardson's shop door easily.</p>

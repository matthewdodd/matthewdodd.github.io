On the 29th of January he called to see me; I asked him in, and he sat down in the kitchen - I had placed this property in the cupboard in the kitchen just before he came in; my fellow-servant went to the cupboard while the prisoner was there, but I did not; I was washing in the back kitchen; I returned to the front kitchen in about ten minutes - the prisoner then got up, and said he must be going, as there was a young person he wanted to see - I then went to the cupboard to get the shopman's tea, and the property was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She stated that I came under the pretence of fetching an apron. Witness. Yes, he came for an apron which he used to put on when he cleaned his knives, and he left it there.</p>

            . I am fellow-servant with this witness - I am nursery-maid. I went to the cupboard while the prisoner was there, for a tea-spoon; the plate was all right then - I took the spoon, and left the rest of the plate there; the shopman was in the shop, and no other person came down.</p>

             re-examined. Q. How do you know that no other person came down? A. I was in the back kitchen, and the door of that opens into the passage, close to the door of the front kitchen; if any one had come I should have seen them - the prisoner had a brown frock coat on, striped trousers, and a black hat; I did not observe any thing particular in his dress - he had no great coat on; the ladles were large gravy-ladles - the prisoner knew I was going to get the shopman's tea, as he had sent down for it - then he jumped up, and said he must be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140097"></xptr>going; he ran up, and let himself out - I went to the cupboard to get the shopman's tea, and then the prisoner went; he had not got three steps from the door before I missed the plate.</p>

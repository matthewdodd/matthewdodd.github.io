            . About a fortnight ago, I was coming up Snow Hill; I saw some spatterdashes that I thought of a neat fashion; having an occasion for a pair, I went in and bespoke a pair: it was at the prosecutor's shop: they not being brought home on the Saturday, I went at night for them. When I came into the shop, there was this woman: I tried a pair, but could not get them on without assistance; the prisoner coming in for a pair of pumps, I was unwilling to hinder the business of the shop, and waited some time with one spatterdash half on and half off; the woman thinking the prisoner a trifling customer, as none would please him. she came to assist me again in trying the spatterdash on; but a woman being unhandy, I desired the prisoner to assist me; he did, but we could not get them on. Seeing they would not do, I was going away: the woman being very willing to do her husband's business, said she would have another trial: then her back was towards the prisoner, who stood half within, and half out of the shop. At last, when I found the spatterdashes hurt me, I gave it up, and desired her to tell her husband to wait on me, to make another pair: I think the prisoner had his answer before this: The gentlewoman looked in the window, and missed a pair of shoes: she said to the lad, Leave the pair of shoes you have got. She turned to me, and said, Sir, the boy has stole a pair of shoes. I went up to him, and said, Friend, I believe you are a thief; you shall not go: he threw both of his arms out in a very odd sort of a way; and as he opened his coat, I saw the part of the spatterdash that turns down, of a tan-colour, fall from under his coat: I took the spatterdashes up, and delivered them to the gentlewoman. I not knowing but he might have accomplices, I call'd in two gentlemen that were going by; in the mean time the husband came home; he sent for a constable, and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; it being in my way home, I went along with them: I said to the constable, it is necessary to search him, to see if he has money enough upon him to pay for a pair of pumps. He was searched, and there were only two six-pences, and a piece of tin bent, so as to appear like a six-pence, found upon him. (The spatterdashes produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was a little in liquor; I went to my mother, and desired she would let me have a pair of pumps; she said she would not. I said I would have a pair; she said, then, if you will, go and chuse a pair, and come again after you have tried them on, and I'll give you the money. I went to the shop of the prosecutrix on Snow Hill; she shewed me a pair; I said they would not do; the gentleman desired me to help him on with the spatterdashes; the prosecutrix said, if I would stay till they had done, she would shew me more: then she said she missed a pair of shoes: the gentleman said, it is proper to search him: I threw my arms out, and hit the spatterdashes as they hung up, and they fell down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Houscombe and the prosecutrix being both asked again, declared they saw the spatterdashes under the prisoner's coat, and saw them fall from thence; and that Mr. Houscombe stood between the prisoner and the place where they had hung, at the time.</p>

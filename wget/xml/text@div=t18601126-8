I am carman to Mr. John Dale of Tooley-street, a licensed carman—on 14th November, I received two chests of tea with an order to deliver them on board a trading vessel at Horselydown—I received one between 12 and 1 o'clock, and the other about 2 o'clock—I got to Botolph-lane about 5 o'clock, and backed my cart to Suffolk-lane—I jumped out of the cart and went into Mr. Bowen's—I returned in two minutes, and the horse, and cart, and tea, were all gone—I spoke to the policeman, and by</p>

               <p>his directions I proceeded towards Tower-hill, in hopes of overtaking the oart, but I did not—on my return, I went to the station in Seething-lane, where I saw one of my chests of tea—the horse, harness, and cart, were found about half-past 6 o'clock in the street, the tail-board of the cart was down, and there was nothing in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Commercial-road—on 14th November I saw the prisoner in a cart in Lower Thames-street, about ten minutes to 5 o'clock—he was driving as if he had just turned out of Botolph-lane, and was going towards Nioholson's Wharf, close to it—he drove the cart along side of the kerb—there was a hole, and the wheel going in that hole drove the water in my face—I looked up and took particular notice of the man—he drove on, and I went towards the Custom House Wharf—after that I saw a police<lb></lb>man and the carman running along—I made a communication to the police<lb></lb>man—I afterwards went to Seething-lane Station—I saw the prisoner—he is the man that I saw in the cart, and he had the reins in his hand.</p>

On 14th November, I saw the prisoner about five minutes before 5 o'clock in Lower Thames-street, near the west end of the Custom House—he was walking towards Tower-hill, and watched him—he was putting down a chest of tea that he was carrying on to a hawker's barrow—I heard him tell the man with the barrow to drive it to Brick-lane—I said, "Hold hard—what have you got there?"—he said "A chest of tea, I suppose"—I said, "Where did you get it from"—he said, "From Mr. Cook or Mr. Cox, I don't know which;"—I asked him if he had an invoice—he said, "I know nothing about an invoice, Mr. Foster gave it me to carry to Brick-lane;" I asked him who Mr. Foster was, he said he was standing in Thames-street, at the corner of Bell Yard—I took him back to see if Mr. Foster was there, and he was not—here is a direction on the chest—it is directed to Wakefield—I took it and the prisoner to the station—as we were going along a man came up, and said there was a horse and cart lost and two chests of tea—I said I had got one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was out to look for a job, and a man asked me if I wanted a job—I said, "Yes;" he asked me to carry this to Brick-lane and he would give me a shilling: I said, "Yes;" and was going there—he said he would follow me—I found it rather heavy and put it on a barrow, and the officer came and asked what I had got: I said, "A chest of tea." I went back to see for the man but could not find him, and the officer took me to the station.</p>

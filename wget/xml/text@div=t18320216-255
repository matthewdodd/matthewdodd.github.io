               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You found that he is a sweep? A. Yes, and I believe he keeps a donkey or two - he said he bought the cart of two men on Saturday morning; I am sure he did not say Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say who they were? A. No; he said he knew two men, and he was on bail a week to find them.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th, I found this cart in my yard, which I had never seen before- I inquired about, but could not hear any thing of it - the prisoner afterwards came to me about it, and asked if I was not surprised at seeing that strange cart there; I said Yes - he said, "It belongs to me - I bought it this morning for 13s.;" I knew him, and was then satisfied.</p>

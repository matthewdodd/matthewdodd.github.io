                  WATERS
               



            . I am a wine-merchant

, in partnership with 
               
                  Jonas 
                  Waters
               



            , we have cellars at No. 11, Cloak-lane


. On the 2d of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found them broken open, and seven dozen of Madeira gone. I have not seen them since.


                  JAMES 
                  DUNLEVY
               



            . I am a bricklayer, and work in Cloak-lane, close to Messrs. Waters' cellars. On the 2d of September, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning. I saw Roberts with a prickle-basket opposite the cellars, on the other side of the way - I saw a flag-basket also, they appeared to be full, another person was with him. I cannot say it was Smith - they both took the prickle-basket and wanted to carry it, but could not, it was so heavy, it fell down, and part of the bottles broke; they went away with the flag-basket, and returned in five minutes for the prickle-basket - they dragged it along the pavement; I thought they might be employed at the vaults. I saw Roberts at Lambeth-street soon after, and I am sure he is the man.


                  DANIEL 
                  FORRESTER
               



            . I live at Mrs. Copelands's wine-vaults, Aldgate. On the 2d of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, Roberts came in - Smith stood at the door with a prickle and flag-basket which appeared full. Roberts opened a bottle of wine, and asked me to take some with him - I lent him a glass, it was white-wine, it appeared to be Lisbon wine, but I am no judge. Smith went away with the flag-basket, leaving the prickle behind, then returned, and they both took the prickle-basket away. I saw him on the Monday following, in custody, and I am sure he is the man.


                  JOSEPH 
                  BRENN
               



            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. On the 2d of September, after ten at night, Roberts gave me charge of a man for robbing him, and owing to what passed I was confirmed the prisoner had been doing wrong. I informed Forrester, who took Roberts, and the week following I took Smith in Wentworth-street.


                  THOMAS 
                  BARRETT
               



            . I am a porter at Whitechapel-market. On the 2d of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in Gulston-square, with a prickle on the pavement - I came by with my barrow; Roberts stopped, and asked me to let himhave the barrow to take the prickle to Petticoat-lane - he was a stranger, I would not lend it him, but wheeled it myself. Three men put the prickle into the barrow, the prisoners were two of them. Roberts went away; I asked who was to pay me? the other man said
"You shall be paid." Smith and the man remained, and steadied the barrow. They took me down Wentworth-street. I said the road was so rough the bottles would break - the wheel went into a gutter, and broke a bottle. It was white wine - they lifted the barrow out. I put the wine into a dirty house which I shewed the constable. They paid me 6 d., an elderly woman was there. I saw Roberts at the Mansion House a few days afterwards, and am certain of both of them.


                  JOHN 
                  FORRESTER
               



            . I am an officer. I apprehended Roberts on the 5th of September, and told him he was charged with stealing wine; he said he knew nothing of it. Barrett shewed me the house, No. 146, Wentworth-street, Roberts occupied the very room he shewed me, I apprehended him there - there was a basket in the room. I went to the cellars, and found the padlock knocked off.

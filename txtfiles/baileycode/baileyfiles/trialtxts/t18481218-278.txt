John Aylett: having been before convicted.






JOHN AYLETT
. I and another are owners of a cottage in King's-road, Camden-town. I missed three feet of lead pipe from there on 30th Nov.—this is it.





GEORGE BAKER
. I was with my brother, near Mr. Aylett's cottage, that day—the prisoner said to us, "What do you two blokes do here?"—we made no answer—he said, "Wait a bit, I am going to get my stick that I chucked in the ditch"—he got over, and we saw him cut the pipe off.





WILLIAM BAKER
. I was with my brother, and saw the prisoner get over, and get the lead—the policeman came up, and shined the bull's-eye in his face, and I saw the pipe in his bosom.






WILLIAM IIERRINCTON
 (policeman, S 149). I took the prisoner—I have not found any lead—I stopped him first, and let him go again.

Prisoner. I was in bed at the time.





JEREMIAH LOCKEKEY
 (policeman, S 130). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted, June, 1848; and confined four months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

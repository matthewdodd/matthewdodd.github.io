JOHN POTTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of November, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



James Kennedy, from his person.






JAMES KENNEDY
. I live in North-place, Camden-town. About four or five o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of November, I was passing through Bishopsgate-street—some one said something that induced me to see if my handkerchief was right—I saw the prisoner in custody of a number of persons—he begged to be let off—I saw my handkerchief with one of the parties who detained him.





FREDERICK KILSEY
. I was in Bishopsgate-street. I saw the prisoner and two others following the prosecutor, and looked round and thought what their purpose was—one of the others was then in the act of taking something from the prosecutor's pocket—he gave it to the prisoner—I immediately seized the prisoner, and the handkerchief dropped from under his jacket—I gave it to the constable.

Prisoner. He said he took it from under my jacket—I never had it at all—it laid a dozen yards off me. Witness. No, it was under his feet—I saw it drop from his jacket—they were in company together.





WILLIAM RICHARD BRIGGS
. I was present, and saw a taller boy take the handkerchief and give it to this one, who put it under his jacket; I saw it drop as soon as he was taken by Kilsey, who happened to say he was not a constable, and he made great resistance—I collared him—he still resisted till the officer came and showed his authority.

Prisoner's Defence. There were two boys going along—one took the handkechief and gave into the other, who threw it by the side of me, and a woman took it up.





HENRY WILSON
 (City police-constable 16.) I saw them all in company, and the prisoner was assisting and aiding them in what they were doing.

             deposed, that his carriage broke down with him on the 2d of August at the end of the Fleet-market


, which occasioned a croud, at which time his pocket was picked of a silk handkerchief.
- Haddersley deposed, that he saw the prisoner pick Mr. Righton's pocket of his handkerchief, which he put in at the bosom of his shirt, from whence the witness took it. (The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).
The prisoner in his defence said, he found the handkerchief in the Fleet-market; he called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

                  MARTIN
               



            . I am carman to Messrs. William and George Nicholls, of Thames-street. On the 22d of March I stopped at the Oxford Arms, public-house, Camden-town


, about half-past seven o'clock - my team stood outside; when I came out I missed the bridle off the horse; I am certain it could not have fallen off; it was not loose. I did not see the prisoners there.


                  THOMAS 
                  HUNT
               



            . I am constable of Hampstead. I received information, and sent for the prisoner Richards, who is a labourer, and lives at Hampstead; I knew him before: I told him I wanted the bridle - he said,
"If that is all you want I will go and fetch it;" he left me, and did not bring it. Next morning I got up early, and saw Castledine in the street - he said,
"Master, did you want me last night;" I said,
"Yes, I want that bridle, where is it?" he said it was at his house; I went with him - he brought it out of the house, and gave it to me - this was on the 25th. I told him he might go to work, and I should apprehend Richards, which I did, on Hendon-road, and in the afternoon I took Castledine.


                  JOHN 
                  BOSTON
               



            . I was with Hunt; his account is correct.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
RICHARDS'S Defence. I picked it up in Hampstead-road; Castledine came into the Cock, public-house - I asked him to take it home to find the owner.
CASTLEDINE'S Defence. I went into the Cock - he said he had picked it up, and would I find an owner.

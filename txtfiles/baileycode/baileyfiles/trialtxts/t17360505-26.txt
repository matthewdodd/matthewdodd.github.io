            . On the 24th of March I had my Door burst open, and some time after we caught two of the Women at the Door and suspected them of bursting it open again: We got a Warrant for them, and they owned that Hart broke open the Door, and directed us where we should find the Goods; we found all but about half a Dozen of the Bottles.

            . As my Neighbour had complained of this Robbery to me, I apprehended Matthews, and Venus on the Premisses: On Venus's Information I took Hart; Venus confess'd that Hart opened the Door, that they all went in, took the Goods, and sold them at the Places where they were found.

            . One of them confess'd this before Justice Midford; but I can't be positive which of the three it was. The Jury found them all 


               guilty. 10d.

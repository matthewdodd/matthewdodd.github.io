Riches Reed. I am a labourer
, and am employed to keep order in St. Paul's church


; the prisoner came into the church as soon as the door was open, and sat upon the bench; I laid my hat down in a nitch there; I took notice the prisoner drew near to where my hat was; I communicated my suspicion to one of the porters; at length I found the prisoner going off with my hat; I followed him; and took my hat from him as he was going to the West door.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not intend to steal it; I thought it had been left there by somebody or other who had been sitting there; I took it up meaning to find out the owner. I am a soldier

Zaccheus Willmott. The 28th of last Month, I was going along and heard some body say, he has got your Handkerchief; I turned about, my Handkerchief was gone, and the Prisoner run away; there was no body near me but the Prisoner.

            . The 28th of last Month I carried the Prisoner before a Justice; I hand-cuffed him, and called a Coach, to carry him to Newgate; and as I was bringing him down by Holborn-Bridge, he was rescued by near thirty of his Gang, with Hangers and Cutlasses; they cut the Coach Doors all to pieces; and the Night before last he was taken again. I am Keeper of New-Prison; I know him to be a very vile Pick-pocket as most about London. 


               Guilty, 10 d.

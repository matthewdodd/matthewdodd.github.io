            . I am an apprentice to William Sharp, a tailor and draper
, of Worship-street. On the 23d of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another standing outside the shop; the prisoner went up to a suit of clothes, which hung outside the door; he unpinned a waistcoat, and put it under his coat - he crossed over to the other, and they went down an alley - I followed and saw the prisoner going in at a pawnbroker's side door - I laid hold of him with the waistcoat - the other got away.

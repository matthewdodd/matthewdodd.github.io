             . I lost a spoon and Mr. Lilly stopped it.
Job Lilly. This Spoon was brought to me by a poor woman to be sold: I asked her how she came by it? She said, very honestly. I said, good woman , I don't know how you came by it, but there has been some violence used to it, and I believe 'tis stolen . She said she would fetch the owner of it: she went and fetched this boy. Said I, my lad , is this spoon your's? He said, yes. I told him I would stop the spoon and him too. He said he would fetch the young woman he had it of. He went away , and I did not see him again till he was brought by the Constable: he said he was let into the house by a journeyman Baker, and seeing the spoon lie about he took it.
Prisoner. I had run away from my master. I was let in by a journeyman Baker, who was the cause of my running away. I asked him to lend me sixpence; he gave me this spoon, and said I should have three parts of the money if I sold it: he said he would be a friend to me all my life time, and desired I would not say any thing of his being concerned with me.

            . I am a waterman
, and keep a skiff. On the 12th of February I stowed it in Davis's Hole, Horsleydown


, between six and seven o'clock in the evening-I missed it next day, and found it at the Thames Police-office. - It was my father's, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Arnall

            . I am a lighterman, and servant to Charles and 
               
                  Robert 
                  Ritchie
               



            , of Greenwich. I lost several sacks out of the barge-one of them was found on the prisoners.

                  BERRIDGE
               



            . I am a waterman
. I lost a pair of sculls from Old Stairs, Horsleydown-those found with the prisoners are them.


                  JAMES 
                  WHITE
               



            . I am a constable. On the 13th of February, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner's in Arnall's skiff, at Horsleydown - They were both in it, with the sack and sculls. I asked them where they were going at that time of the morning? they said, they were going to do a job at Scott's craft, at Horsleydown. I asked where Scott's craft were? Hastings said he did not choose to tell me. I asked him his name? he said it was Smith. I asked him if he meant to persist in that name? he said, Yes. Cummings refused to tell me his name-I took them both to the office. Hastings then said his name was Hastings; I told him I knew that. Arnall claimed the skiff-Hastings said it was Arnall's.
CUMMINGS'S Defence. It is a common thing for watermen to borrow of each other.
HASTINGS'S Defence. The things were all in the skiff. I took it as my own was not afloat.

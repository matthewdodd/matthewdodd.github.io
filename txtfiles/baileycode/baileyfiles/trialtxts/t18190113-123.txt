            . I am a seaman. I had watched the prisoner and another man, several nights, lurking about. On the 30th of December I was watching, saw the other man go into the shop, take the boots, and give them to the prisoner. He went in again, reached over the counter, and took a pair of shoes. I collared them both - the other man dropped the shoes and got away. I took the prisoner into the shop with the boots under his arm.

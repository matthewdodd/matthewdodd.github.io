DAVID NUNEZ CARVALHO
. I live in Fleet-street, the prisoner was my errand-boy. I am a bookseller and stationer—in consequence of information I went to a house in Coleman-street, and then to a room in Duke's-court, Drury-lane—I there found some hundreds of printed books, and the other articles mentioned in this indictment—on one of them here is my own writing, and on some others is my private mark.

Prisoner. There are about four books which are not Mr. Carvalho's, and he has charged more for them than they are worth. Witness. I do not know what he refers to; the only one I have any doubt about is this one of Uncle Oliver's Travels.





RICHARD MATTHEWS
 (City police-constable, No. 80.) I took the prisoner into custody—I then went to Duke's-court, Drury-lane, where I knew the prisoner's mother lived—I found this property there.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years—To the Isle of Wight.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

            . I keep a chandler's shop
 in Wapping


; last Wednesday was a week, between seven and eight at night, I was gone into the back kitchen, my little girl that is about eight years old screamed out; I came into the shop; she said, O daddy, daddy, the bacon is gone; I went to the hatch, and a boy told me he saw a man go with something from the window; I pursued as he directed; I saw a man under a lamp with something bulky; when I came under it, he, by looking back, had a full view of me; he made a sort of a run, I ran and catched hold of him; he dropped the bacon; I collared him; there were other people came; I left him to them, and took up my hat and wig, and bacon from the dirt.
Q. What part of the shop was the bacon taken from?
English. It was taken from the window; it was pretty near 200 yards from my shop door where I took the prisoner with it.
Prisoner's defence.
Coming through Wapping, as I was going to see my aunt, I heard stop thief cried; three fellows ran by and dropped this bacon in the kennel; I made a full stop, and this man came and charged me with stealing his property; I made no resistance, but was very willing to go where he chose to carry me.

1249. 




JOHN SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of April, 1 mat, value 6s.; the goods of 




Daniel Cronin; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE GILLATT
. I am in the employ of Daniel Cronin, an auctioneer, in East-street, Lamb's-Conduit-street, This mat stood in his passage—the prisoner is a stranger to me—he was brought to me with the mat—he had no business in the house.





PHILLIPS REQUART
. I saw the prisoner, in Holborn, go into several passaged, and turn up the mats—to see if they were good, as I suppose—I

followed him to lamb's-Conduit-street, and into East-street—he passed the prosecutors's door two or three times, and waited about three-quarters of an hour looking round to see if anybody was in the way—I presently saw him coming round the mews with the mat under his arm, and secured him.





WILLIAM DAVEY
. I am a policeman. I have a certificated of the prisoner's conviction which I got from Mr. Clark's office, (read)—I know him to be the man—I was a witness on his trail.




GUILTY
. Aged 45.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Park.

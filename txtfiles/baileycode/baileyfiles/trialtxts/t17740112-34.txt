            . I live in Bunhill-row, in the parish of St. Luke's


: my house was broke open and robbed on the 26th of October. I went to bed about nine at night; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, but my wife can give the court a better account of it than I can.

            . Some workmen had been at work upon the house; they had nailed up the door when they went away at night; when I got up in the morning, I found the door wide open, and missed the several things mentioned in the indictment I found the blanket on the prisoner's bed; the prisoner said a girl had brought the copper, and had a duplicate to it.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house, but guilty of stealing the good
            .

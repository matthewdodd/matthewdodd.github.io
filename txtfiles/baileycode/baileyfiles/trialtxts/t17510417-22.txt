Anthony Wyer. I live in Montague-street, Spittlefields


; on the eleventh of this month in the morning, I went up stairs and left my young child below. The child called out, daddy, daddy, the woman has stole my mammy's gown; I run down out of the house and detected the prisoner in Bell-lane, with the gown and handkerchief under her arm; produced in court and deposed too.

            . I live next door to the prosecutor, I heard a noise, seeing Mr. Wyer run, I run, and was at the woman almost as soon as he, the woman had the gown loose under her arm not bundled up. When he took hold on her she said pray let me go, it is the first thing I ever stole in my life.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been at White-chappel, I met a woman, she said you look a little concern'd; said I, I am very uneasy in my mind; she told me she would help me to half a day's work, and bid me hold those things while she went a little way and came again.

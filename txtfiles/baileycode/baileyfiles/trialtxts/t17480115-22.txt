            . I am a lodger in Mr. Akroyd's house, he keeps a publick house
; the maid said to me, there is a woman run out with a stew-pan. I followed her, and laid hold of the Prisoner, and 
               
                  John 
                  Taylor 
               



             took the stew pan out of the Prisoner's hand.
Q. Did you see her run out?
Joy. I did not.
Q. Did you see her in the house?
Joy . Yes, after she was brought back with the stew-pan .
Q. What did she say?
Joy . She said it was not her that took it, but she owned it afterwards.
Q. Do you know it to be Mr. Akroyd's stew-pan?
Joy . Yes.

            . I heard a rumbling noise upon the kitchen-stairs , and the maid cried out stop thief. I saw the Prisoner just after she had passed the cellar-stairs , and 
               
                  Robert 
                  Joy 
               



             took hold of her in the street. I heard the copper stew-pan knock against some iron palisades; said I, what have you got here? She said, nothing. I took the stew-pan from her, and carried it into the house: and she said, she found it; but at the Round-house she said, she did take it out of the house.

            . On the 11th of December, going out of this court into this yard, I felt a hand in my pocket: I turned about and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand. I took him with it in his hand, and brought it into court. ( Produced in court and deposed to.)
Mr. Montague. I was at the court-door at the time, and saw the prisoner in court at the time sentence was passing on the convicts last sessions; then he went out, and in a few minutes time, Mr. Kirby brought him in again with the handkerchief.
The Prisoner said nothing in his defence.

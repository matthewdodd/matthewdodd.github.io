            . I am a turner
 in Aldersgate-street


; the prisoner was servant
 to me four months and a fortnight; my wife missed a coloured apron; she asked the prisoner after it; the prisoner said, she would find it in the drawer; while my wife went up to see for it, the prisoner ran away; after that we missed the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them;) we took her at a mussin-shop in Old-street on the 3d of March, we took her before Justice Girdler; there she confessed she had taken these things and carried them to pawn, and directed us to where she had carried them.

            , I live in Vinegar-yard, Falston's court , Drury-lane


, in a one pair of stairs room: about 6 o'clock last Monday was se'ennight we went to bury my child, this woman had been before in my room, and sitting just by my trunk she saw me take out on half guinea ; and when I came home I met her on the stairs coming down: I found my door and trunk both broke open and five guineas gone; I went the next morning to Justice Fielding's and got a warrant, and she was taken up and search'd, and under her left arm was found my snuff-box, in which the money was, in my trunk the day before, and there was in it 4 guineas and 19 s. in silver. The Justice ask'd her how she come to have so much money about her and to have ne'er an apron before her; she said she had pawn'd her apron for 4 d.

             . The prisoner came to me in my room, and said she had receiv'd a letter from her husband and she was to receive 20 s. from him on Saturday-night, seeing 2 s. 6 d. in her hand I suspected her, having heard of the robbery before.

             . I am constable, I was sent for to the prisoner, and the women there all agreed to be search'd; I came to the prisoner, she said she had no money at all; said I, I must search you as well as the rest; (she was very unwilling to be search'd) from under the left bosom I took out this box (which the prosecutor swore to) and in it was 4 guineas in gold, and 19 s. in silver.




               Guilty of stealing, but not out of the dwelling house
            .

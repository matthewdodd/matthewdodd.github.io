            , On the 25th of January, when I went to dinner, there were four bundles of stockings on the compter; while I was at dinner the prisoner came into the shop; when she was gone, my servant called out that she had got something; he followed her, and in five or six minutes he brought her back; I lifted up her cloak, and she dropped the stockings from under her arm; I am sure they are my property; (a part of the stockings produced); they are trimmed particularly for the East Indies.

            , a servant to Mr. Manning, confirmed his evidence.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was not near the compter; I never had the stockings; Mr. Manning never touched me, nor examined me; he leaned on the compter and threw them down; he said he had been robbed a great many times and somebody should suffer for it.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.




               Guilty of stealing the goods, but not guilty of stealing them privately in the shop
            .

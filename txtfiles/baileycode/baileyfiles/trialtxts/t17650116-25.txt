Mrs. Flyn. I am wife to 
               
                  Barney 
                  Flyn

                  Catharine 
                  Clark 
               



             had lived with me; I did not know the other prisoner. I lost a pair of sheets, on the 4th of January, at night; and the Monday following, I lost the other things, at night, from out of my bedchamber.
Q. What did you lose that night?
Flyn. I lost two gold ear-rings, a basket full of half-pence, half a dollar, an odd silver buckle, three shifts, four coloured aprons, two laced handkerchiefs, one plain one, and three caps; they were all safe about seven at night, and I missed them about nine. When Clark was taken up, she confessed she got a step ladder out of the next kitchen, and got over the pales, between my neighbour and me; she got upon the shed, and put up my window, and came into the room (we found the window put up); this she said at our house, and also before the justice.

            . I was the officer that took the prisoners up. 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Clark 
               



             had on, when taken, an apron, a pair of shift sleeves, a shift, a cap, and handkerchief, which the prosecutrix said were her property. When they were both in the round-house, 
               
                  Catharine
               


             M'Farley sent the woman of the round-house to pawn a handkerchief, which the prosecutrix also owned. (Produced and deposed to).


                  Mary 
                  Brooks 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Clark 
               



             brought a shift, an apron, and a pair of sleeves, to me to pledge. (Produced and deposed to).
Q. to Prosecutrix. Do you know any thing against 
               
                  Catharine
               


             M'Farley?
Prosecutrix. I know no more than what 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Clark 
               



             told me. She said, the other was along with her, and stood in the street, to receive the things: this she also said before the justice.
Clark's Defence.
I owned before the justice, that I did commit this robbery; on account my master and mistress promised me I should not be hurt.
Q. to Prosecutrix. Did you make such promise?
Prosecutor. No, I never did.
Q. to Dridal. Did you hear such a promise made?
Dridal. Mr. Flyn desired her to let him know where the things were: he said, tell the truth, and you shall not be hurt.
Both 


               Guilty of felony only
            . 



               T

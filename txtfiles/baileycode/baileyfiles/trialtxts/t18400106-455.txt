JOHN ROBERTS.
I am assistant to Mr. George Mew, a linen-draper, in Holborn. On the 3rd of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, a little girl came, and told me something—I then missed this flannel—I looked, and saw the prisoner crossing the street with it under her arm—I caught her in Brownlow-street with it—I had seen it safe just inside the shop about an hour before.





GEORGE MARCH
(police-sergeant F8.) I took the prisoner, and have the flannel.




GUILTY.**Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years

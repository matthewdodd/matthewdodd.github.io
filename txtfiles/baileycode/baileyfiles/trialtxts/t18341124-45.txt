WILLIAM WILLIAMS
. I was passing along the Poultry, about nine o'clock, on the 1st of November. I felt something at my pocket—I turned suddenly, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief under his coat—I collared him with one hand, and seized the handkerchief with the other—he struggled very hard, but the officer came and took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it—it was thrown into the auction-room, between me and a gentleman—I picked it up—the prosecutor said it was his, and I said he might take it.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

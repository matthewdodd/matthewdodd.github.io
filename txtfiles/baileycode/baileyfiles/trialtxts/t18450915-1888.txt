. Aged 17.—



Confined Six Months.






MARY MILLER
. I am single. Swain was in my service—I have known him for the last eighteen months—I have seen Collins about the door—I saw the articles stated, safe on Monday—I did not miss them till the policeman brought them to me—these produced are mine.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
. (policeman.) About five o'clock in the evening of the 2nd of Aug. I met the prisoners together in Rochester-row, a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Miller's—Collins ran away as soon as he saw me—Swain had a table-cloth and some towels under his arm, and Collins had the salts in his pocket—I gave Swain to a man to hold, and overtook Collins—he said Swain gave him the salts—I asked what he ran away for, if he was not guilty—he said he knew I should lock him up—I knew him before—I had never seen Swain.

Collins's Defence. I live nearly opposite Mrs. Miller's; Swain asked me if I would come with him to Westminster on an errand; I said, yes; I waited for him in the Broadway; he had these things; I asked where he got them; he said he did not know; he gave me the salts to hold while he stopped; we were going home again to Mrs. Miller's.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
. re-examined. I produce a certificate of Collins' conviction—(read—"Convicted 25th of March, 1845, of larceny, and confined three months")—he is the person.

COLLINS



GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

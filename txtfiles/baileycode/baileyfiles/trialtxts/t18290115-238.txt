            . I know Mr. Carew's shop, in Ward's-row, Bethnal-green - he sells clogs
. On the 12th of January, I saw the prisoner and another come from the shop, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening; the prisoner had something under his jacket - he turned down the first turning; and I saw him stooping behind a pump; he then came towards me - I asked what he had under his jacket; he said Nothing - I went to the pump, and found these clogs at the bottom of it; my brother-officer took the prisoner - we went to the house.
JAMES GLIBBERY. I was with Hall, and took the prisoner; he said another boy gave them to him, and then he said he knew nothing about them - at the officer he said he meant to pawn them.

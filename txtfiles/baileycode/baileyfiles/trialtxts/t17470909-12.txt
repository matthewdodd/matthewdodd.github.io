            .
Q. to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Lluelyn 
               



            . What Business are you?
Lluelyn. I am a

            . On the 30th of July the Prisoners came into Mr Reynolds's Shop for Tobacco. I did not see them take it, but they were taken up and carried before Justice Withers, and I heard them confess it before the Justice.
Q. What did either of them say upon that Occasion?
Lluelyn. They both of them confess'd they took the Hat: One took it out of the Shop, and the other sold it to one Mrs White, in White-cross street, for 1 s. Mrs White has the Hat here.
Q. Who said he took it?
Lluelyn. 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



             and 
               
                  Peter 
                  Berry 
               



             had a full Pot of Beer out of the Money.
Isabella Reynolds. My Spouse keeps a Toba cconist Shop in Golden Lane. That Man, 
               
                  Peter 
                  Berry 
               



            , came into my Shop, it was between nine and ten o'Clock at Night. This Gentlewoman, that lost the Hat, came in and her Work-woman with her. 
               
                  Peter 
                  Berry 
               



             ask'd for a Chew of Tobacco; then came the other in, 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



            , and he ask'd for a Farthing's Worth of Tobacco. I told him to go about his Business. I had not sat above ten Minutes but they both came in together, and Wright went to that part of the Counter to which he ought not to go. As soon as he was gone I told Mrs Lluelyn that I thought one of the Men had taken something away. She said, she hoped not. She came then into the Shop, and said, she had lost her Hat. And I said, that is what is taken away then. The next Morning I enquir'd of some People if they had seen such a Thing, and they told me, that they had seen 
               
                  Jack 
                  Wright 
               



             with such a Thing. I was told where 
               
                  Peter 
                  Berry 
               



             lodged, and when I came to him, he said, that this Wright stole the Hat, and that he had a full Pot of Beer out of it.

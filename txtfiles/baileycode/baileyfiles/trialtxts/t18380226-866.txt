JAMES CHRISTIE
 was again indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






JAMES SMART
. I am in the employ of John Smart and another, silk and

velvet-manufacturers. They have a customer of the name of Mylie—on the 23rd of February the prisoner came to me, and produced a pattern of silk serge, and asked for a piece of goods to match that for Mr. Mylie—he said he came from him—I gave him 112 yards of it, worth 20l.





MYLES MYLIE
. I deal at the house of Smart and Co.—I do not know the prisoner at all—I did not authorise him to go in my name to get these goods, nor any other—I never received the property—it is quite lost.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years more. (There were two other indictments against the prisoner).

1380. 



MARGARET WELSH
 was indicted

for stealing 1 tippet, value 16s.; 1 pair of drawers, 1s.; 1 shift, 1s.; 1 table-cloth, 1s.; 1 handkerchief, 4d.; and 1 apron, 6d.; the goods of 



Samuel Newson, her master; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






EMMA NEWSON
. I am the wife of Samuel Newson; we live at No. 138, Bethnal-green-road—the prisoner was in my service—I sent her with these articles to Mrs. Crockford, the mangler's, on the 30th of May—she did not return—I sent to the mangler's, and the things were not there—I also lost a tippet—this is it.





WILLIAM TRYETT
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitechapel. This fur tippet I took in pledge on the 30th of May—I could not say of whom—it was a woman resembling the prisoner.





ALICE CROCKFORD
. I am the wife of Arthur Crockford. I carry on the business of a laundress and mangler—I did not receive of the prisoner, on the 30th of May, those drawers and other things—I did not see her that day.

Prisoner. I know nothing about it; I took no things out of the place to mangle.





EMMA NEWSON

re-examined. I gave her them out of my own hand, and saw her leave the place with them—I did not see her again till the Saturday night afterwards, when I found her walking in Wheeler-street, and gave her into custody—she lived with me only three days—she gave the duplicate of the cap to her mother, and she tore it up.





NATHANIEL JACKSON
 (police-constable H 114.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction in this Court—(read—Convicted 12th June, 1843, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

JOHN BRUGGER. I am a clock-maker
, and live in High Holborn


. On the 16th of March, about a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I was watching behind my door, having been robbed, and saw the prisoner come into my shop, and take a clock; hearing me behind him he ran out with it, and threw it down near a public-house; I followed and took him, without losing sight of him; the clock was brought back to me.

            . I lost this shirt from my laundry on the 9th of October - I sent the prisoner (whom I had employed, on account of her mother) home with some linen; when she came back she came to me for the money for carrying it, and asked whose basket of linen that was which stood there - I told her, and she said she would take it; I said No, I will take it on Monday - I took it on the Monday, and missed one shirt.

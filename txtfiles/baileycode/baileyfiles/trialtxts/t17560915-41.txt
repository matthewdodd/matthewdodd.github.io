            . I live at Marybone, and lodge at the house of William Green. I lost upwards of 40 l. but there is a mistake in the indictment for instead of 3 guineas it should have been 30; there were upwards of 30, which I lost along with the foreign gold pieces.
Q. Where was the money taken from?
Limbrick. It was all in one drawer, in my lodging room.
Q. What was the prisoner?
Limbrick. She was my servant about three months.
Q. Were the drawers lock'd?
Limbrick. They were, but by taking out the upper drawer the board it run upon was broke; so she could put her hand down and take it out.
Q. When did you lose it?
Limbrick. It was in January was twelve months. She left my house upon it, and I advertised her directly. When she was taken, she confessed the fact to me. I asked her how she came to rob me. She said she took all the money, and was sorry for it. I asked her what she had done with it, and she said she had squander'd it away.
Q. Did she mention any of the particular pieces ?
Limbrick. No, she did not. She said that after she had taken it she went to a house in Drury-Lane, where she gave a woman four guineas to go and buy her some things.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.




               Guilty of stealing, but not in the dwelling house
            .

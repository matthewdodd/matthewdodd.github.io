            . I am a sword-cutler
, and live in Vere-street, Clare-market


. On the 23d of August I was at tea in my back-room, and heard a noise at the window, which had been broken, and a plate put against it. I perceived the plate had been knocked down, and a quantity of thimbles gone. Next morning a little boy came to sell me a thimble which I knew to be one of them. He said he lived at No. 9, Steward's-rents, I sent him home. A girl came in and said, a boy was there with a quantity of thimbles. I went there, and found the prisoner laying on the floor on a blanket, and charged him with it. He produced the thimbles and snuff-box.

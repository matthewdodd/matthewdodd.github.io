            . I am a watchman in Gray's-inn-lane. On the 3d of February I heard a rattle sprung, I run and took hold of the prisoner, a man named Moses said that the prisoner had been ringing his bell; I found a pint pot in his bosom, and asked him where he got it; he said,"do not hurt me, I have got another on the other side." I took them out.

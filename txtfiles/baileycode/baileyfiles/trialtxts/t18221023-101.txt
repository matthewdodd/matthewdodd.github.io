                  , from his person

EMANUEL JACKEY. I am a seaman
. On the 19th of October, I saw the prisoners in Bluegate-fields


, about half-past five o'clock at night - they pulled me into their room - and both of them took the money stated in the indictment, out of my pocket. I was a little in liquor - my money was safe just before. They ran away out of the house; I followed and saw them go into another house in the court. I am sure of their persons.
WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am an officer. The prosecutor complained to me on the Saturday, and on Monday night he was watching the house they ran into. We went in and found they had escaped. I found them in ten minutes after, concealed in two separate houses. Long said,
"Am I one of the girls?" the prosecutor said,
"Yes, you are."Jones at first denied living at the house the robbery was committed at, but afterwards acknowledged it.

FRANCIS HALLIFAX
 (police-constable N 38.) I Was on duty in Kingsland-road, on the 20th of February, about a quarter to four o'clock—a man told me something, I went across the road and the prisoner dropped this pair of breeches, when I got within two or three yards of him, from his apron, and ran off—I picked them up—I overtook him about fifty yards and then took him to Elliott's, a pawnbroker in the road, about sixty yards from where he dropped them.





GEORGE HANCE
. I am warehouse-boy to Mr. John Elliott, a pawnbroker of Kingsland-road. We had some breeches outside the door for sale—I missed this pair when the officer brought the prisoner—we had not sold them.

Prisoner. There were other boys as well as me—I never had them.





FRANCIS HALLIFAX

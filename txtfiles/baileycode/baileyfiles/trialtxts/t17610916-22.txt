                  Ann 
                  Maddox 
               



            . The prosecutor is a lunatick: all I is, I bought this coat [produced in court] and a pair of brass buckles, and I know he had an iron tobacco-box. He has been in Bedlem two or three years at a time.


                  Mary 
                  Hawley 
               



            , I went into the fields to wash my gown, and 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Allen 
               



             was with me. I having daggled it after I washed it, I laid it down to dry. Shaw came and brought a man with her. She borrowed a penny of me. She gave Allen, who was there also, a pair of brass buckles.
Q. When was this?


                  Ann 
                  Maddox 
               



            . This was the 3 d. of Aug.
Q. What man was it?
A. Maddox. I do not know the man.
Q. Look at that man [directing her to Rant.
M. Hawley. That is the man: he pulled off his cloaths, and laid them down by him. Shaw took my apron, and tied his coat up in it, and carried it into Field-lane to sell it.
Q. Had you ever seen that man before?
M. Hawley. No, I had not.
Q. Did the prisoner seem to know him?
M. Hawley. No, they thought he was drunk.
Q. Did he say any thing to them, when Shaw took his coat.
M. Hawley. No, he only said, give me my equipage. I went after Shaw, to Field-lane, to the door where she went in, the people did not chuse to buy it, then she went and pawned it for 3 s. 6 d. and fetched out a new checque-apron with part of the money.
Q. Where did she pawn it?
M. Hawley. At Cow-cross, to Mr. Masters. She gave me the box that was in the coat-pocket: the perriwig she put upon a bush, and somebody took it away. She gave one buckle to Garret, and the other to Allen: she would have given me a groat, but I would not take it. The other two prisoners had no share of the money.
Q. Did the man make any resistance?
M. Hawley. No, he was not able.
Mr. Masters. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Cow-cross. I lent Shaw 3 s. 6 d. on this coat here produced. She told me she brought it from one Mr. Knight, and she redeemed a checque apron at the same time, that lay for 18 d.
Rant was set up, but not sworn.
Q. Do you know what these women did to you?
Rant. I attribute it to downright madness.
Q. Doing what?
Rant. Their doing.
Q. Do you know that lady ( meaning Mrs. Maddox)
Rant. I know her, I lodge there.
Q. How came she to take care of you?
Rant. By my inquiry.
Q. Who pays for your lodging?
Rant. I am responsible in the watch-making to my obligations.

Q. How much a week do you get?
Rant. Seven or eight shillings.
Q. Do you know what it is to take an oath?
Rant. Yes.
Q. Do you know what will be the consequence if you take a false oath?
Rant. Yes.
Q. What?
Rant. The production of money, find money.
Q. Do you know what obligation you are under when you take an oath?
Rant. Nothing but a fine, as the law shall demand.
Shaw's Defence.
I was going across the fields, and picked up a pair of shoes; a man came to me, and he had none to his feet; I gave them to him. I went farther, and picked up a coat, and said to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Garret 
               



            , we have found a coat, if any body asks for it we will give it to them. Then I went to Mr. Masters, where my father and mother pawn things; I pawned it for 3 s. 6 d. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hawley 
               



             went along with me; she had half the money, but 3 d. I had 1 s. 9 d. and she 15 d. We had two pints of beer. Then she went to the justice's, and forswore herself, and made her escape three times from the keeper of New-Prison.
Allen's Defence.
I know nothing of it.
Garret's Defence.
The same.

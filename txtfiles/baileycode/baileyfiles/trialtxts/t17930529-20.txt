I live at Fulham. On the 1st of April I lost a coachman's coat and a pair of gloves; the coat was worth 1 l. it was hanging in the stable when I left it; I missed it a little after two; it was my mistress's coat, she lives at No. 14, Upper Seymour-street

             sworn.
On the 1st of April last I was in the stable in same Mews; I left the stable for about five minutes, I went to borrow a truss of hay at the next stable, and when I returned I met the prisoner coming out of the stable with a coachman's frock in an apron under his arm; I throwed down the truss ofhay from my back and ran and catched him by the collar; then he desired me to let him go, I would not let go; he said there was somebody at the top of the mews wanted to speak to me.
Q. Pray did he speak english? - Yes.
Q. And did he understand what you said to him? - Yes. And then he offered me his money and watch if I would let him go; I told him I did not want any thing of the kind, he should go back along with me to the stable, for he had got something more in his bag; I got him back to the stable and then I sent for somebody to come to my assistance, and then I sent to the house to let them know what had happened, and then they sent for the constable and he was taken to Marlborough-street; the constable emptied his bag and there was the coachman's great coat in the bag.
Prisoner. When I came through the street I called clothes, and as I came along to this door this man laid hold of me, two minutes after I had bought this great coat, and this man came up and seized me by the collar, and I told him if he would go back with me to the place I would shew who I bought it of.

            . Do you recollect when you went out whether the great coat was hanging up there or not? - It does not belong to our stable; he took it from another stable.

            . That great coat belongs to your mistress; had you ever sold that great coat to the man? - I could not sell it, it was gone when I came back.
Prisoner. I bought the coat for fifteen shillings, and I sadly wanted the man to go back to shew him the person whom I bought it of.
Court. Have you got that man here now that you bought it of? - No, I wanted to go and shew him where I did buy it.

            . How lately had you seen this great coat? - I had seen it about one when I left the stable, and I missed it when I came back again.

            . Is it customary for you to leave the stable door open? - I don't stand by myself, I saw it there when I left the place; it is a public stable in Seymour mews. (The great coat produced and deposed to.)

            . Pray what time did you stop him? - A little after two.
Q. Pray who remained with you while you sent for assistance? - I sent a little boy; he wanted me to let him go several times; he pulled his money and watch out, but I would not let him go, because I thought he had something else in his bag belonging to us.

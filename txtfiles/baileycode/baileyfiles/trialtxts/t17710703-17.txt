               breaking and entering the dwelling house of

            . +
"When Saytuss was brought to the bar to be arraigned, he appeared to be deaf and dumb. The judge directed the sheriff to impannel a jury to try whether he was dumb through obstinacy, or by the visitation of God. A jury were accordingly recorded by the sheriff, who after an examination of several witnesses, who had known him from a child, brought in their verdict that he was dumb by the visitation of God. A person with whom he had formerly lived as a servant
, was sworn interpreter, who explained to him the nature of his indictment by signs; and the Court assigned him council."

            . I live in Little Queen Ann street, Marybone


. On the twentieth of June
 we went to bed about a quarter after one; I was alarmed with the dog, but I dared not go down. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment as mine; the other things belonged to my servant, 
               
                  Abigail
                   Hatton
               



            , who is a married woman. I was the first that went down; I found the area door and the kitchen window forced: I found a knife they had lifted up the bar with.
Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?
Bradshaw. 
               
                  Frances
                   Allen
               



             lived a servant
 with me about nine days; she had left me about a fortnight ( the two silver nosles, the candlestick, the waiter, and the tea chest produced.)


                  Abigail
                   Hatton
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Bradshaw.
Q. What time did you go to bed on the night of the 19th of June?
Hatton. About one o'clock.
Q. Did you fasten the window?
Hatton. I bolted the door, and tried the kitchen window; it had a bar across it; the bottom was forced.
Q. When you went down in the kitchen what did you observe?
Hatton. The kitchen door and window were open; the door seemed fast.
Q. How was the kitchen window?
Hatton. The bar seemed to be lifted up with that knife.
Q. Why do you think so?
Hatton. I tried it afterwards myself, and lifted the bar up.
Q. Did you lose any thing?
Hatton. Yes, the things mentioned as mine in the indictment (repeating them;) a pair of my shoes were taken off the feet of 
               
                  Frances
                   Allen
               



            .
Q. How came you to think of searching her feet?
Hatton. She left a pair of her own shoes for them, which my mistress had given her some time ago.


                  Francis
                   Surrey
               



            . On the twenty-first of June I got up just before three o'clock; I went to catch my horse; I saw four people in a field called the Rope walk.
Q. Were either of the prisoners any of them?
Surrey. Yes. Beeks, the evidence, and Altops; the fourth is one 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Jones
               



            .
Q. Did you see the man there?
Surrey. When I went to get the horse I went into my yard; I saw feathers about the yard; I suspected somebody had been stealing my fowls; I suspected these people I saw had stolen them. I went into the Rope walk again, and there I found three more: Dunny Jemmy, 
               
                  Thoma
                   Molloney
               



             (not in custody) and 
               
                  Frances
                   Allen
               



            ; I suspected their stealing my fowls, because they had a bundle. I rode my horse as far as the bar, which was as far as I could; then I pursued them on foot; they seeing me coming, ran off; after that they seemed to stop. I did not like coming up to them; in the middle of the field I stopt too. I saw Dumb Jemmy give the bundle to 
               
                  Frances
                   Allen
               



            ; they went to the dunghill, and there seemed to separate. I saw Molloney run over the dunghill on the left hand from Tottenham Court Road. I came up to Allen; she had the bundle; I charged her with having my fowls; she said she had nothing but her own. I continued pursuing them; I took Dumb Jemmy and Jennings; I called for assistance; 
               
                  William
                   Hamilton
               



             came up.
Q. How long were they at the dunghill?
Surrey. Not long. I insisted upon Hamilton going with me to the dunghill; I expected to find my fowls there. I went there; I found a silver spoon; the next thing was a silver waiter: I shewed them to the prisoners, and asked them how they were marked; they could not tell. I charged the constable with the two men first, then we took the women into custody; they were taken to the round-house: they did not deny it before the justice. Dumb Jemmy was not called to the bar.
Q. How did they do to make Dumb Jemmy understand?
Surrey. He was not asked any questions. I asked him about my fowls; he said,
"No,
"not me."



                  William
                   Hammerton
               



            . I am a watchman; I saw the last witness on the twenty-first of June very early. I was calling the hour of three; he called to me to stop them: I stopt Dummy Jemmy and Jennings; he said they had got his fowls: I took them back to the dunghill; we went there: he picked up a silver spoon first; the next thing was a silver waiter; that was all that was found at that time. We took them to the constable; the two women were gone another road. We took the dumb one to the watch-house, the other we took to pursue after the women. Jennings went with them to shew us the door where the women were to be taken.
Q. Had not you some information from Jennings?
Hammerton. A little; he desired to be admitted an evidence; I said, after some time, I thought we had better go again to the dunghill. The constable said, he thought it was not worth while. I went back; the other watchman, Green, went with me. I poked my stick into the dunghill, and poked out this candlestick (producing it) I brought it down to the constable.
Q. Was you acquainted with Dumb Jemmy before?
Hammerton. I have seen him in the street before, but never conversed with him.
George Green. I am a watchman. I was upon my stand. I went, upon Mr. Surray's calling out to assist. I saw the candlestick found.
Q. Did you ever see the prisoners before?
Green. Not that I remember. I was at the taking of the women. Allen delivered me that hat and apron: she put her hand in her bosom, and took out a pair of silver nosles for candlesticks: the three girls were by at the same time.
Q. Did you find any thing upon Beeks?
Green. No. (The nosles are tried, and fit the candlesticks exactly.)


                  William
                   Hawthorn
               



            . Between three and four o'clock on the twenty-first of June, Surray and two watchmen, and another who is not now present, called me up. I threw up the sash, and saw Dummy Jemmy. I had never seen him before to my knowledge. I saw in Surray's hand this waiter and silver spoon. Jennings said, if we would admit him an evidence, he dared to say he could take all the rest. I told him it was not in my power to admit him an evidence, but if he would shew me where to find the others, I would speak to the justice for him to be admitted an evidence. He asked if I would go after the girls first; I said, By all means. He took me to a house near Hog-lane: he asked at the parlour door, if Sall was come in; they said, No. He went up one pair of stairs, and asked there; they said, No. He came down, and looked into the yard, and said they were there. He desired not to be seen himself, but told us to go into the yard. We went into the yard; there the three women stood. I saw the parlour door open as we came in, and saw it shut afterwards. I thought they might be there; I forced the door open where the old woman lay: I said, Where is the bundle that was brought in here? She said, God bless you, Sir, it is under the bed. Allen gave the watchman the two nosles of the candlesticks, that hat, and an apron or two I found in the bundle.
Q. Did you see Allen give the nosles to the man?
Hawthorn. I did not; I was searching about the room. They were all tied together in one bundle, except the tea-chest, that was dropt on the road, and picked up by a carpenter. They are separated, Mrs. Bradshaw's and the maid's in two bundles; they were in one before.
Court to Hatton. Look at the things.
Hatton. These things are mine (repeating them) I carried the woman to the round house, and went with Jennings in search of the other women, but could not find them. I put Jennings in the round-house, and then went to Mrs. Bradshaw's and alarmed them. When Allen and Beeks were examined before the justice, they acknowledged that she had waited upon Jennings three or four times, in order to break open this house. Jennings had told his story then, and they acknowledged it.
Q. Were there no threats or promises?
Hatton. No; none. The justice asked whose knife that was; Beeks said it was Altop's. Jennings was asked if that was true; he said, No. Beeks pulled it out of her pocket, gave it him, and he gave it to Allen; then she owned that it was hers. Allen owned that he opened the shutters with that knife.
Q. Did Saytuss say any thing?

Hatton. Only said, Me, me: I apprehended he wanted to be admitted an evidence. We had a suspicion he was concerned in the robbery and murder at Chelsea; we asked him if he was, and said he might be admitted an evidence, if he was. He said, Not me.
Cross Examination.
Q That expression, Not me, might fit any other question as well as that.
Hatton. By his answer I apprehended he understood that question.


                  James
                   Jennings
               



            . I have known Dunny Jemmy a good while.
Q. Was you in company with them on the twentieth of June?
Jennings. Yes; we went to the Noah's Ark; I, Altop, Dumb Jemmy, and Malsoney.
Q. How came Dumb Jemmy to be there?
Jennings. He waited at the Noah's Ark, by appointment, for me.
Q How did he understand you?
Jennings. I made motions to him to follow me.
Q. What was consulted then?
Jennings. To go to Mrs. Bradshaw's house. Allen said, if he would not go, she would go by herself.
Q. How did you make him understand that he was to go to Bradshaw's?
Jennings. By motions how to get him in to be lifted over the rails, to undo a door or window.
Q. That he was to break open the house?
Jennings. Yes. We went away about half an hour after ten, and were there by eleven.
Q. Who went?
Jennings. I, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Malloney
               



            , Saytuss, Allen, and Altop. We got there by eleven; Allen said they were up; we went into the fields till one o'clock, then Frances Allen said they were all a-bed. Dunny Jemmy went over the rails first, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Malloney
               



             afterwards. Dunny Jemmy lifted up the sash of the window; there were no outside, there were only inside shutters; they tried to open them, but could not: they desired us to lift Allen over; I and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Altop
               



             lifted her over; I gave her the green handle knife that has been produced, which I had from 
               
                  Sarah
                   Beeks
               



            ; Allen put the knife through, lifted up the bar, and the bar dropped; she then shoved the shutters open, and went in; 
               
                  Thomas
                   Malloney
               



             and Dunny Jemmy followed; they shut the shutters to, and I walked about: it was about half after one.
Q. How long did they stay?
Jennings. Better than an hour. There was a woman looked out at her window, and saw us walking about; she called the watchman to her door. When the clock struck three, while the watchman went his rounds, they came out. Allen came out of the house; I was in the fields when she came out, she had a b undle and two silver candlesticks with the tops. Dunny Jemmy came out first, to see if the way was clear about, a quarter of an hour before the others; then Allen, and then Altop came out. Malloney had the waiter, the spoon, and tea chest; I took the tea chest out of his hand, and put it into Beek's hand. Dunny Jemmy took the bundle from 
               
                  Frances
                   Allen
               



            , and Malloney kept the waiter and spoon and marched on, and I took the candlesticks from under Allen's petticoat; one I delivered to Salter, the other I carried. We got across the rope walk; we saw Mr. Surray riding after us; we ran away. Dunny Jemmy delivered the bundle to 
               
                  Frances
                   Allen
               



            ; I took the two nosles out of my pocket, and delivered them to her. Dunny Jemmy, just as we came to the dunghill, snatched the candlestick out of my hand, and buried it in the dunghill. I went on, and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Malloney
               



             took the waiter and spoon out of his pocket, throwed them down, and covered a little dirt over them. 
               
                  Thomas
                   Altop
               



             made off with the other candlestick. This man, Surray, followed us till we came to Tottenham-court Road. 
               
                  Sarah
                   Beeks
               



             dropped the tea chest in the road.
Q. How long have you known Dunny Jemmy?
Jennings. Two or three months.
Q. from Beeks. Did I or 
               
                  Thomas
                   Altop
               



             deliver you the knife?
Jennings. You did. I met the women at the French 'Change, there we agreed to go and commit this burglary.
Q. You settled your plan there, who should go into the house?
Jennings. No; at the house. Dunny Jemmy made motions, first, to get over.

Allen's Defence.
I should not have got over the area, but 
               
                  Thomas
                   Altop
               



             made a great oath he would run the knife into me, else.
Beek's Defence.
When 
               
                  Thomas
                   Altop
               



             delivered the chest to me, I would not take it for the space of ten minutes, till they threatened me.

I live in Great Wild-street


, the 26th of last month I hung a window curtain out at the door at three in the afternoon, in a stable yard at the back of the house.
What became of it afterwards? - I went to take it in between seven and eight, and it was gone; I heard of it the next day.

             sworn.
On the 26th of June, I was coming up Great Queen-street, about a quarter after seven in the evening, I was on the left-hand side, I saw the prisoner on the right-hand, and knowing him for some time, and seeing a curtain under his arm, I ran after him, he ran away, he ran through a court that goes out of Queen-street about the middle of the court, I called to him to stop, and he dropped the curtain immediately; I picked up the curtain and followed him, but I lost sight of him somewhere about there, I knew his person well, I have known him for twelve or fourteen years, I have not the least doubt; I took the curtain to Bow-street, I took the prisoner afterwards.
(The curtain deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Beamish came in with that curtain over his arm, and he said nothing to me; I never had the curtain in my possession at all; he has known me some years; I have no witnesses, I had yesterday.

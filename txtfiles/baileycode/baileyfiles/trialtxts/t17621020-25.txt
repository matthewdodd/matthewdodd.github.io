            . On the 16th of September I heard some little disturbance at the Queen's Head in the Old Bailey


; some people were quarrelling; I had not been in the house half a minute but I felt something at my pocket; I turned about, and saw the prisoner push out into the street; I followed, and took him with my handkerchief in his hand; I took him before my lord mayor, and he was committed.
Prisoner's Defence.
There were two men fighting in the house; I went in to call for a pint of beer; I found a handkerchief there, and as nobody owned it, I was going out with it.

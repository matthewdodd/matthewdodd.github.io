AMELIA READER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of April, 1 counterpane, value 3s., and 1 pair of stays, value 3s., the goods of 



John Reader: and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN READER
. I live in Princes-street, Tyson-street, Bethnal-green—I left home on the 9th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, and left my daughter (the prisoner) in possession of my house—at eleven o'clock in the evening I came home, and missed ray counterpane off my bed, and the following day I missed the stays—the prisoner came home, I told her I had missed them—she acknowledged taking them, and said she had pledged them—I have no wife, I have three other small children—the prisoner is the eldest—she said she wished to be transported for seven years.





WILLIAM GOLDER
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce the counterpane and stays, which I took in of the prisoner.

Prisoner. I am very sorry for what I have done—I will not do so any more—it is through my sister, who turned me out of doors—my father has more need to correct his other children than me—he has said he wished to transport me—I want to go home to work to earn money.





CHARLES BYRON
 (police-constable H 157.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years,—Penitentiary.

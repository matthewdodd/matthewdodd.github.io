            . On the 2nd of August last, about one o'clock, I was in Fleet-street


. The officer will prove the circumstances; all I know is I lost my pocket-book containing bank notes to the amount of one hundred and twelve pounds.
FRANCIS FAGAN. I was with Thompson on the day in the Indictment, between one and two o'clock. I saw the prisoner with two others following this gentleman. By the direction of Thompson, I watched them up Fleet-street. The prisoner was placed next the gentleman whilst the other two strove to hide him from the passingers. I observed the prisoner turn round with a pocket-book in his hand, which he immediately put in his bosom; he then walked a few paces towards Temple Bar, and I apprehended him.
MICHAEL CAIN. I went into this place, and took the pocket-book out.

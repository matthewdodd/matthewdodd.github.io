            . I am an artist
, and live in the Poultry. On the 8th of February, about half-past six or seven o'clock, I was going into the Olympic theatre


; I had my purse safe when I got there - I took my money out to pay before I entered, and almost immediately as I got in I missed it; it contained four half-crowns and some silver - I had felt a pressure at my pocket.

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. I apprehended both the prisoners in the theatre; I told them I had information that they were both thieves, and had no business there; I found on Webb a purse, containing four half-crowns, six shillings, and four sixpences; I called Mr. Thurston out, and he swore to the purse - nothing was found on Shaw.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Toole, I believe, gave you the information? A. He did.
GEORGE THURSTON. This is my purse, and contains the same money as I lost in it; I am certain of the purse, from the particular wear of it.

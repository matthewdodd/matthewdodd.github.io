            . I am a Thames police officer. On the 29th of October, between four and five in the morning. I was in a boat in the river Thames. The moon shone at the time. I saw the three prisoners jump out of a tea lighter, that lay along side of a barge, at Lady Parson's stairs. The name of the lighter was the Nell. The three prisoners jumped out of the lighter into a skiff, and immediately, as the boat passed me, I discovered something floating on the river, which I picked up. It was two bags; they contained tea. I then shoved after the skiff, wherein was Stapp, the watchman. He had put the two Palmers into a boat. I left Stapp in the skiff, in charge of 
               
                  James 
                  White
               



            , and pursued Palmer, in another boat. I came up to them, and searched them. I found in 
               
                  John 
                  Palmer
               



            's hat and pockets about two pounds of tea, and about half a pound of loose tea in 
               
                  Henry 
                  Palmer
               



            's pockets. I took them in custody, and took them all to the police office. Stapp was searched, but not in my presence. Two shawls were found on Stapp, and a ripping chissel, a sail needle, and a case. I afterwards went to Mr. Beckitt, the prosecutor, and I accompanied him to the lighter, where I saw the prisoners come from. I found there a chest of tea had been broken open, and some tea had been scattered about in the hold of the lighter. The chest of tea is here, and this is the tea that I took from them. The tea appears to be the same sort as the tea in the chest.


                  JAMES 
                  WHITE
               



            . I am a Thames police officer. I was in company with the last witness, when the prisoners were apprehended. I searched the prisoner Stapp, and on him I found a chissel, a packing needle, and case, and two keys belonging to the hatches of the Nell, lighter.


                  JAMES 
                  BECKITT
               



            . I am a lighterman. The prisoner, Stapp, has been a servant of mine for several years, and 
               
                  Henry 
                  Palmer
               



             was my servant.
Q. Had you a lighter called the Nell, laying off Parson's stairs - A. I had; she had tea in her, and among the tea was that chest produced here to day. Stapp was my watchman. I saw him go away with the lighter, and these keys produced now he had atthe same time about him. He was in charge of the lighter, as my watchman.
Q. Examine the tea taken from the pockets of the prisoners, with that in the chest, and say, so far as you can judge, whether they are the same tea - A. I have no doubt but it is the same that was taken from the chest.
Q. Parson's stairs is in the county of Middlesex - A. It is.
Stapp's Defence. I was in the craft by my master's orders. When the two other prisoners came on board, asked who that was. He said it was Harry, and Jack was with him. They said they had been out drinking, they could not get in.

                  Palmer
               



            's Defence. I got up soon in the morning to get the lighter out. The tea that was found on me I bought of a seaman, he said, it was his sea stock.

                  Palmer
               



            's Defence. I have nothing to say but what these men have said.

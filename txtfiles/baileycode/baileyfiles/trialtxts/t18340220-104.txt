             - the servants said they had lost some silver spoons, and did not know who to suspect - the prisoner was then in the house - I suspected him, and he went away, and I followed him - I stopped him about sixty yards from the house, and asked where he was going - he said, "To the East India Dock" - I took him to the station - I found in one of his breeches pockets one silver spoon, and in the other pocket the other spoon.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor - the prisoner's sister lived in the family; and he used to come to visit her - we had missed nine silver spoons - we sent for the officer - the prisoner was not in the house when we sent; but he came before the officer did - he went out again, and the officer went after him.

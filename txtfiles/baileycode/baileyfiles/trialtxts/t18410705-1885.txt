GEORGE WILSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of June, 1 till, value 1s.; 60 pence; 108 halfpence; and 24 farthings; the property of 



Ann Boddington.






ANN BODDINGTON
. I keep a shop in Orchard-street, Westminster. On the 20th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the back parlour—I was called, and went into the shop—I missed my till—there had been about ten shillings'-worth of money in it—this now produced is the till.





SARAH MAYNARD
. About four o'clock in the afternoon, on Sunday, the 20th of June, I was going down Orchard-street—I saw three or four boys standing there—as I was coming back I saw a shorter boy than the prisoner go down Duck-lane, with the till on his head—I went and told Mrs. Boddington.





JOHN ABBOTT
. I have known the prisoner for some time—on the 20th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him coming round Duck-lane with the till on his head—there were a good many others round him—he took the till down Simond's-buildings, and left it there—there were some papers in the till—he left them in it, and I saw he had some money in his cap, but I did not see him take it out of the till—he and the others then went away.





CHARLES BODDINGTON
. I was informed of this, and went and found this till in Simonds-buildings, and the papers in it.

Prisoner. I never had the till on my head.




GUILTY
.† Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

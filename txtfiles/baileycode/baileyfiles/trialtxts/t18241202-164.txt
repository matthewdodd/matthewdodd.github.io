                  , from his person
            .
JOHN DUNCAN. I am a carman
. On the 4th of November, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was by Whitechapel-church


, and met the prisoner, she asked me to go home with her - I went to George-yard


 - she asked me to sit down, which I did for a minute or so. I asked, why there was not a candle in the room - she said she would go and get one. I did not feel my watch taken, but I know it was safe when I entered the house, for I felt it - she had been feeling about me, but I did not feel her take it. I missed it - she did not bring the candle, and I came away.

            . I am a watchman. The patrol brought the prosecutor to me; and about two hundred yards from the house, I found the prisoner - she had 14 s. 6 d. under her arm-pits, but no watch.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.

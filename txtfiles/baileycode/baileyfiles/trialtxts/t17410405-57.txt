             hoisted Higgins on the pantiles belonging to a Skettle Ground: Higgins then pushed up a Sash Window, and went in, and let us all in at the Yard-door. When we got into the House, we broke open the Kitchen Door, and struck a Light, and took out a a Saddle, a Bridle, a Saddle-Cloth, a Jack-weight, and a great Brass-pot. These Things we carried to my House in White-Lion Street , which the Prisoners persuaded me to take, on purpose to deal with them in this Way. The brass Pot, Bridle and Saddle. we sold for about 30 s. the Jack-weight we sold to one Mr. Thistleton , but the Table is at the Prisoner Hayes's House now.
Mr. Gibbons . That Saddle was found in Hayes's possession.
Hayes. Hood said that the Saddle and Bridle were carried to his House.
Hood. Yes, when we took them they were carried to my House, and the Monday following we all agreed that the Saddle was worth 20 s. and the Prisoner Hayes allowed us so much for it, and took it to his own House. He had a Ground Floor backwards in a House in White-Lion Street , and I saw the Saddle hang up in the Cloth some Weeks afterwards.
Prisoner Hayes. I only bought the Saddle of him: Can he say that I was concerned with him in stealing it?
Hood. Yes he was, and the other Prisoner too.
Lowin. Was I ever in the House?
Hood. Yes, he was in the Entry of the House by the Kitchen-Door.
Lowin. Did not you swear before Justice Poulson , that I stood in the Street all the while?
Hood. He stood in the Street afterwards to look out.
Mr. Moreland. This House is Mr. Churchman's , and he used to go 2 or 3 Times a Week there, but I don't know that there was any Bedding there, or any Conveniencies for a Family.

            . The 2 Prisoners and Hood used my House in Short's-Gardens some Time, and I heard the Prisoner Hayes and Hood making a Bargain about a Saddle, a little after Christmass . I never knew any Thing amiss of either of the Prisoners, but Hood always seemed to be a very quarrelsome Man.

ROBERT WILIAM ELLIOTT
. I am an accountant in the Excise-office. On the 9th of April, between four and five o'clock, I was in Shoreditch with two ladies—we stopped at a jeweller's shop window to look at some jewellery—I had a handkerchief in my pocket, and I had scarcely got to the Window when I saw the ruffling of my handkerchief over my left shoulder—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand close behind me—I pursued him—he carried it some distance, and then threw it down—the officer took it up—I pursued, and he was stopped—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it.)

Prisoner. I was not behind him at all—I never saw him till I was taken. Witness. I never lost sight of him.





MILES DOWLING
 (police-constable H 135.) On Thursday last I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief in his hand, probably from the prosecutor—he ran down Bateman's-row—I pursued him till he threw it down—I took it up, and followed till he was taken.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to look for work; some person stopped me, and somebody said, "That is the boy that took the handkerchief;" I had never seen the gentleman.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

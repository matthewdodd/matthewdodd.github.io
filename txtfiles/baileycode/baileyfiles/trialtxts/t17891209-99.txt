Prosecutrix. I know them to be mine, by a mark I put on them myself, S. B. I lost them on the 9th of November; I put them into the bundle at Birmingham, and had them with me all the way on the road; the prisoner came in the coach with me; I saw it last at the Bull and Mouth Inn, in London, I did not miss them till the third day after I came to town; we came to the inn about four o'clock on the Tuesday; on the Friday I missed them; they were tied up in a cloth and put in the coach seat; I left them in the coach while we supped; the prisoner brought no bundle into the coach, but took one out; she told me where she lived; but I did not find her by that direction precisely, but I found her near the spot.
The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character.

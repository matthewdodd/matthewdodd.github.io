JAMES PILGRIM. Between twelve and one o'clock in the day, of the 13th of November, this money was in a purse in my waistcoat pocket; I was in my stable in Whitechapel


; the prisoner was in my employ - I put my waistcoat on the corn-bin; I saw it again in about five minutes: I had gone up to the loft for some hay for the horses, and bolted the door before I went up; while I was up there I heard the door unbolted - I looked out of window, and saw the prisoner running away: I came down stairs, felt in my pocket, and the purse and money were gone. I wentafter the prisoner, but did not see him again till I met him on the 22d, and took him to Lambeth-street; I said I had been waiting for him some time; he said, "I heard you wanted to see me;" he said he was innocent.
Prisoner's Defence. I know no more about the money than you do; there were two more boys in the stable - he asked me to go into the loft - I would not, and he turned me out of the stable; he went up, and was asleep there for two hours; I waited for him in the yard all that time.

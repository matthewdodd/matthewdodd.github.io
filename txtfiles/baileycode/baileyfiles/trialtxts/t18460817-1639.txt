1639. 





BENJAMIN EMERSON
 and 




JOHN KING
 were indicted for

 stealing 50lbs. weight of peppercorns, value 1l. 17.; and 1 sack, is. 6d.; the goods of 



John Yates, the master of Emerson; and that King had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM FENN
. I am clerk to John Yates. The prisoner Emerson is his foreman, and had access to his premises—we have such pepper as this in the warehouse—this sack is Mr. Yates's.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How do you know it? A. There is a mark on it—Emerson has been in the employment three years—he had access to the warehouse, to get bran—this pepper was taken from the warehouse—the stable door is not constantly open—the key is left in it.





JOHN ARCHER
 (policeman.) In consequence of something I observed, I hatched, and saw Emerson come from his master's stable, look about, and

then go back to the stable—in a few minutes I saw King come and go into the stable, and afterwards come out with this sack containing the pepper—I followed him into Wilderness-row, and asked what he bad there—he said he was going to carry it to the top of the street for a man, who was to give him a pint of beer—I took him to the station—he came from the stable—there is a house between the stable and the warehouse—I took him about five minutes before Emerson was taken.





HENRY TUEPIN
 (policeman.) I was with Archer, watching, and saw Emerson come from the stable door, and King go in, and come out with the sack.





JOSEPH RADCLIFFE
 (City police-constable, No. 375.) I produce a certificate of King's former conviction—(read—Convicted Nov., 1844; and confined six months)—he is the person.

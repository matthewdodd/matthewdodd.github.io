            . I am twenty one years of age. I was apprentice to a fishmonger in St. James's Market. The prisoner and I were together in Charles-street, Berkeley-square, about five weeks ago; he was a gentlemans servant
; going along Chesterfield-street


, we saw the area door open at Mr. Windam's, the prisoner went down, and in about five minutes he brought up five silver tea spoons. We sold them to Mrs. Manning, an old cloaths woman in St. Gyles's, she keeps a house there, for 4 s. and 6 d. between eleven and twelve o'clock. I believe, four of them were marked alike, she knew how we got them; because we had been with her before.
Q. How long had you left your master?
Cook. I had left him two years, and had been in connection with the prisoner about two months.
Q. Where does Mrs. Manning live?
Cook. She lives near the Green Man, on the back of the alms-houses, in St. Giles's.

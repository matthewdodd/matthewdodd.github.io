            . I am a grocer, and live in Golden-lane. On the 12th of January, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner by Walden's house, which is next door to me - he went up to the door, took the mutton off the stand, and threw it away a few yards off; I ran and secured him five yards off, on the other side of the way.

            . I am a butcher
, and live two doors from Williams. I was at my door; the prisoner came, and took a neck of mutton - it was thrown into the road; a friend took it up.

            . The prisoner was given into my charge.
Prisoner's Defence. I was rather intoxicated; I took the meat, and threw it down, not with any felonious intention; I offered to pay for it when they took me - I did not move from the place.

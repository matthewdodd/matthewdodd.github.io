            . I am a sugar-broker
, and live in Mincing-lane. On the 1st of February, about noon, I was passing the end of Gracechurch-street


; I felt a tug at my pocket - I turned, and saw the colour of my handkerchief in Jones' hand; he passed it to Smith - I seized them both, and Smith dropped it at his feet.
Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. I believe this is a great thoroughfare? A. Yes, but I am positive Smith is the man who dropped the handkerchief, and that Jones gave it to him - I had seen them together for some time.
Jones. The prosecutor said that Smith took it, and now he says I took it.

            . No, I can swear Smith dropped it, and I took it up - it has the mud on it now.

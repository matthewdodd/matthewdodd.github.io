            . I live in Brownlow Street, Holbourn


, and am a silver-smith
. The prisoner was employed to file silver buckles
 for me, and had lived with me about twelve months. On the 8th of March 
               
                  John 
                  Fox 
               



             had detected him with a parcel of silver file dust, upon which I incuired where his lodgings were. I went there with my son, and we found other parcels there; I had left orders at home to let him go. There were about eight ounces in the whole. I had not spoke to him about it at that time. Then I called him into the shop, and asked him if these filings were not my property, and told him where I found them. He said they were, asked pardon, and said he was sorry for what he had done; he owned he had taken all that, and what he had about him, in about a week's time. I got an officer, and took him before Mr. Fielding, where he confessed the filings were my property, and the justice committed him.
Joshua Cooper. I am son to the prosecutor. John Fox, one of our servants, having seen the prisoner with some filings in his hand, I and my father went to his lodgings, and found there two other parcels of silver filings

            . I am servant to Mr. Cooper. On the 8th of March I saw the prisoner with some silver filings in his hand, and he seemed to hide it, which gave me a suspicion of him, so I acquainted my young master with it.
Prisoner's Defence.
On the 8th of March, when I came to work in the morning, I kick'd a bit of paper before me in the shop, which I pick'd up, and there was about a quarter of an ounce of filings in it.

                  Fox 
               



             came and asked me what I had got in my hand, and bid me put it into the skin, and said if I did he would say nothing to my master about it; but presently he told my young master of it.

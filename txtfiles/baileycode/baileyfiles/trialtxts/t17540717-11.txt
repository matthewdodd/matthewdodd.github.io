                  , in his dwelling-house

                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            , I live in Somerset-Street, Whitechapel


, in Aldgate Parish; we have a lodger; she went out to get something for supper. I saw the door a-jar when I went to bed for her to come in. I know not how the things were taken.
Q. What did you lose?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            , I lost a scarlet shag waistcoat that was not finished, two old coats, one old cloth waistcoat, a pair of leather breeches, a cloth cloak, from out of my shop. (I am a Taylor.) I never saw the prisoners before I saw them after this before Justice Withers along with the evidence here. They confessed nothing.
Q. Did you ever find the goods again?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            . No, I have not.


                  Jane 
                  Adcock 
               



            . I never saw the persons before I came before Justice, Withers. We lost the goods mentioned, and I know the door was left a jar at the time we went to bed. There were no locks broken.
Jos. Stevens. I am about 15 Years of age; 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Hamilton 
               



             sent me to this taylor's door to see if I could push it open. I pushed several times at the door and it would not open.
Q. What time of night was this?
Jos. Stevens. It was betwixt 10 and 11 at night. Then Hamilton pulled me from the door, and said, D - n you, I know how to open it better than you. He took a knife out of his pocket with a hook to it, and it immediately put back the bolt of the door; then he and I got into the entry. Wood stood at the door, and said, Make haste, for it is growing late. We all went with an intention of breaking the house open. We took a red plush waistcoat out of the box, a pair of buck-skin breeches, a pair of cloth breeches with leather linings, and a duffil coat, and a coat with one sleeve, and a waistcoat of the same, and a pair of fustian sleeves with blue ribbons and brass buttons. We delivered them to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Sadler 
               



             to sell; she went for Hamilton's wife; we all lodged in one house; she sold them; we had 8 s. 6 d. we gave her a shilling for selling them, and had half a crown each.
Q. to the prosecutor. Were these your goods?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            . Yes, my lord, they were; there was such a coat as he mentioned with one sleeve.
Q. to the prosecutor. What was the value of the two coats?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            . About 10 s.
Q. to the prosecutor. What is the value of the shag waistcoat ?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            . The two yards of shag cost 30 s. besides the making up.
Q. What is the old waistcoat ?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            . That is but a trifle.
Q. What the leather breeches, and shag breeches?


                  William 
                  Adcock 
               



            . Four shillings.
Jos. Stevens. I went and bought this waistcoat and cap I have on out of the money. We were taken up about a woman that is in Clerkenwell; she was an evidence against the two prisoners; then Hamilton began to tell all he knew, and Mr. Withers said I was the youngest, he'd make me evidence.
Q. Where did you lodge?
Jos. Stevens. On Saltpetre-Bank, a private house.


                  James 
                  Warren 
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Withers Hamilton wanted to be made an evidence, and began to confess; but Mr. Withers knowing he had been an evidence here in January sessions, and cast five persons for transportation* he would not admit him, but admitted the other.
* See No. 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, in this Mayoralty.
Wood's defence.
The thief-catchers desired the prosecutor to prosecute us, and offered him a reward if he would.
Q. to the prosecutor. Did any body offer you as the prisoner has mentioned?
Prosecutor. There were two runners or turnkeys of New-prison and Bridewell said to me, they would give me a note for my chance.
Hamilton's defence.
That evidence is egg'd on by the thief-catchers, and he will swear any thing. I know no more of what he says than the child unborn.

            , he is my brother, and has been always in my care.
Q. How is he your brother? His name is Wood.


                  Jacob 
                  Dubois 
               



            . Mine is the French name for Wood. He is a draw-boy to a weaver, and I am a draft-weaver. He never wronged me or any body that he worked with to my knowledge.


                  Peter 
                  Dubois 
               



            . He is my brother; he has worked with me a great many times, and he never wronged any body where he did work that I know of.


                  James 
                  Liaver 
               



            . The prosecutor saying he had got such an affair, I went with him. I heard one of the men at the prison offer him 10 l. if the boys were hanged.

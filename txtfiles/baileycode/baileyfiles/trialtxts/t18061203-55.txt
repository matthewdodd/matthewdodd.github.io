            . I am a carrier
, I drive the Richmond errand cart. On Monday last about four o'clock I lost a bundle, which I had received from the Angel in Salisbury street in the Strand; the bundle was to go to New street, Knightsbridge.
Q. Where was your cart. - A. At the end of Charles court in the Strand


. As I came out of the court, about just as nigh to the cart as I am to your lordship, I saw the prisoner at the bar get out of the cart with the bundle, he went across the road, I pursued him and took him, and brought the basket on my shoulder that contained the bundle; he was never out of my sight till I took him.
(The property produced and identified.)
Prisoner's Defence. I leave myself to the mercy of the court. I have been bred to the sea, I would humbly hope your lordship would let me go on board one of his Majesty's ships again.

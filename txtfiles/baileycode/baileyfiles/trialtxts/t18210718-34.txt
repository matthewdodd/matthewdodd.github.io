            . I am coachman
 to Mr. Mills, of Bristol. On the 20th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Bond-street. We went to a house in Woodstock-court, Oxford-street


, and went up stairs. I had pulled my brooch out of my neck handkerchief, and put it in my left-hand breeches pocket, where my notes were. I had four 10 l. Bank of England notes and one Bristol note in my left-hand breeches pocket - I was quite sober. I felt the notes at the bottom of my pocket when I put the brooch in it. I awoke at twenty-five minutes before five o'clock, and she was gone. I found the lining of my breeches pocket torn out, and my property gone - she had left her gloves and stays behind. I found her in White Lion-street, Seven Dials, about five o'clock that morning.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How came you out so late - A. It was nearly two o'clock when I drove my master from the Opera. They called the prisoner Mrs. Payne. A girl, named Fuller, told me where to find her. I am sure she is the woman - I had seen her before with a woman whom I knew.

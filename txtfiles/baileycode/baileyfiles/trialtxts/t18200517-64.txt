             boards there. On the 8th of May, about one o'clock in the day, three men came to the area, looked in the kitchen-passage, and asked if I wanted any wood; only one came down; I said I wanted none; he immediately went up the steps, took the coat from the window on the ground-floor, and ran away. I ran up and called out that somebody had stolen a coat; and as he ran out of the court into the square, he dropped it. Pybus pursued and took the same man who took the coat, and I picked it up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

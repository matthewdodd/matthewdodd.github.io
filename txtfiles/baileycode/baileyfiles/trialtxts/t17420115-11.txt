            . On the 23d of Dec. in the Evening, I was spending the Evening at a public House, and my Daughter came to me, and Inform'd me I had been robb'd. I went Home directly and missed the Goods mention'd in the Indictment. The next Day I went to Goldsmith's-Hall, and advertised my Goods, and the Day following one of the Gold Rings was brought to my House, but I can't tell by whom, because I did not see the Person that came with it.

                  Simmonds 
               



            . I am Daughter to the last Witness. On the 23d of Dec. I went to the Prisoner's House, and while Lumley and I were at Dinner, the other Prisoner came in. When we had din'd we went to our House, and when I had put on a clean Apron, we went out to go as far as the Fleet: there were the two Prisoners, my Sister, and I together, and when the Man (Burgess) came as far as St. Andrew's Church in Holborn, he swore he would go no farther. She (Lumley) would have gone on with us, but he made her go back with him, and so I and my Sister parted from them. We went then as far as the Fleet, and as we came along from thence, we called at another Place, so that it was near six o'Clock when we got Home.
Q. In what Condition did you find the House then?
Simmonds. We found the Street Door and the Parlour Window both open, and we directly missed all the Goods that are in the Indictment. My Father advertised them on the Thursday, and on the Friday, which was Christmas-Day, this Gold Ring was brought to our House by Mr. Manners , a Goldsmith in the Strand. After this I went to the Swan Tavern the Corner of Newport Market , where I receiv'd Instructions from several of our Relations, how I should go to find the Prisoners. Accordingly the Goldsmith's Maid and I went to the Prisoner's Lodging, and took them both out of Bed, and carry'd them to the Tavern. We then went before the Justice, and there the Woman confessed she had the Things, and where they were, but the Man denied that he knew any Thing of the Matter. She own'd that she had the Things, and that they were at her Lodging in May-Fair , and said that he (Burgess) had the Key in his Pocket, and that he had baited her to do it. Burgess afterwards took the Key out of his Pocket himself, and deliver'd it to her, and we open'd the Room Door with it, and found all the Things that are in this Sack. She likewise told us, that the Gown and Petticoat, and the Ring with 6 Diamonds , were in pawn in Marlborough-Meuse , and she went with us to the Pawnbroker's, and we found them accordingly. At another of the Prisoner's Lodgings in Newport Market we found my 
               
                  Garnet
                   Ear Rings
               



             , a Diamond Ring, and a Cypher Ring, and the Woman own'd they were mine.
Pris. Burgess. Did I give the Key to my Wife (Lumley) or to the Constable?
Simmonds. He first denied that he had the Key, but he afterwards took it out of his Pocket and gave it to his Wife .

            , jun. I went with my Uncle and Cousin to Mr. Manner's, and they describing the Woman Prisoner, we agreed that Mr. Manners's Girl and my Sister should go to their Room. Accordingly they did, and Manners's Servant knowing her to be the Person that had been at their Shop, the Prisoners were both brought to the Tavern. From thence we carried them before Justice Fraser, and we went into the Entry with the Woman Prisoner, where she confessed that she pick'd open the Locks of the Drawers with a Knife, and took the Things away in a Sheet: that she carried them into Russel-street , and ty'd them up, and then gave a Man 3 d to carry them into Hanover Yard, where her Husband was waiting for her, and that he (Burgess) carry'd them to May-Fair . When the Justice had examin'd the Prisoners, we took Burgess to the Round-house till next Morning, and when we left him there, Lumley desired him to give her the Key of the Room: he at first denied that he had it, but afterwards gave it to her, and then she told me, if I would go with her she would shew us where the Things were. Upon this we took a couple of Coaches, and went to May-Fair , and open'd the Room Door, and found all the Things that are in this Sack, after which she herself pull'd a Tile out of the Hearth, and took out 2 Gold Rings, a pair of Ear Bobs, and a pair of Gold Buttons. We afterwards carried her to the Gatehouse, where she told us she had pawn'd the Petticoat, Gown, and Diamond Rings at Marlborough-Meuse , and a pair of Sheets in West street, and we found them accordingly.

            , Constable. On Christmas Day at Night, I was sent for to the Swan Tavern , and charg'd with the 2 Prisoners. I took them before Justice Fraser , who examin'd them, but they both denied the Fact. After they had been there some Time, the Woman Prisoner went into the Passage with this Gentleman, that Gentlewoman and myself, and she own'd to us that she had taken the Things and wrapp'd them up in a Sheet, and going along, she dropp'd the Cup or the Mug, and kick'd it before her, and pick'd it up again: that when she came into Russel-street , she ty'd the Things up tight, and gave a Man 3 d. to carry them to Hanover-Yard . Upon this I told the Justice if he discharg'd the Man Prisoner, he would go and secure the Goods; but the Justice refusing to detain him, I order'd him to aid and assist me. He refused, upon which I again insisted on his being confin'd, and then he was sent to St. Ann's Round-house. When we came there, the Woman said to him, Burgess! you have got the Key of the Room! No, (said he) I have it not: Why (said I) when I search'd you just now, you had it in your Pocket. He then deliver'd the Key to her, and that very Key unlock'd the Door in May Fair where these Goods were. After this, Lumley went with us to Mr. Young's a Pawnbroker in Marlborough-Meuse , where the Gown, Petticoat, and Rings were pawn'd; and the Sheets we found by her Direction pawn'd at a Neighbours. When we came to the Gatehouse , she told me she had sold some Things to Mr. Manners's, upon which I went there, and found some Silver Tea Spoons, and Part of a large Spoon broken, and one that the Silversmith said he had melted down. It was near 11 o'Clock that Night before we got her to the Gatehouse , and this Gentleman, (Simmonds, jun.) and I went with her to her Room in Newport-Market, to fetch her Pockets and other Things, that she was to take with her to Prison. We asked her if there was any Things concealed there, and at first she said there was not, but afterwards she said she had often heard her Husband talk of hiding Things under the Bricks and Tiles, and she went directly to the Hearth, and took up a Tile, and found 2 Rings and these Buttons.
Pris. Burgess. Did I deny the Key when she asked me for it?
Warner. He did deny that he had it.

            . I am Servant to Mrs. Manners; and all that I have to say is, that Lumley is the Person that brought the Ring to my Mistress.

            . About 3 Weeks before this Thing happen'd, Burgess and his Wife took a Lodging of me in May-Fair . On the 23d of Dec. I saw them both go up Stairs. Burgess had a Bundle upon his Back, and I gave his Wife a Candle to light him up, and when he came down again he had no Bundle at all, only the Candle in his Hand, and the Key of the Room upon his Finger.

                  Young 
               



             . On the 23d of Dec. the Woman Prisoner brought a Gown, a Petticoat , and a Ring to me and desir'd to have Money upon them. I ask'd her if they were her own? she told me they were, upon which I lent her 1 l. 15 s. upon them. She did not come in her own Name, but in the Name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Elderson 
               



             , and I am sure she is the Person .
Pris. Burgess . Did you ask me if they were my own?
Young. Yes, I did.

            . I happen'd to be in the Neighbourhood where my Brother Simmonds lives , and being inform'd he had been robb'd, I went to him, and we agreed to draw up an Advertisement , and go to Goldsmith's Hall. On Christmas-Day this Ring was produc'd, upon which we went to Mrs. Manners and were told by her Maid that she should know the Woman Prisoner again. Upon this we agreed, that as my Neice was pretty well acquainted with the Prisoner, she and Manners's Maid should go together to see if she knew her. When they came there, she said she would swear to her, and then we went up Stairs, and took them out of Bed, and carry'd them before the Justice, where the Woman Prisoner confessed the Robbery in the same manner as has been told before. We took the Man to St. Ann's Round-house, and just as we were going away, his Wife (Lumley) said, Burgess! you have got the Key! and he said, I have it not: but the Constable telling him that he had got it in his Side Pocket, he gave the Key directly to his Wife. After we had secured him, we took a couple of Coaches and went away, and found all the Things that are in this Sack.

            , jun. was present when the Prisoners were apprehended, and heard some Part of Lumley's Confession before the Justice. He confirm'd the above Depositions, so far as they related to the Goods found at the Prisoner's Lodgings in May-Fair .
Lumley's Defence. This Man (Burgess) is innocent of the Matter. My two Cousins din'd at our House that Day the Robbery was committed, and when he came Home he was drunk. We were going to the Fleet to see Mr. Jones , and he came along with us as far as St. Andrew's Church, and then he would go no farther, but took hold of me, and said I should go back with him into Newport-Market . Accordingly I did, and he laid down on the Bed for a Quarter of an Hour, and then went out. My Cousin charg'd me that very Night to come to their House, and when I came there, the Street Door was open, and in I went, and took these Things. I hired a Man in Plumbtree-Court to carry them to May-Fair, and was to give him 6 d. for his Trouble ; and in May Fair I found this Man (Burgess) and he carry'd them Home for me, and I concealed several of the Things under my own Cloaths because he should not see them.

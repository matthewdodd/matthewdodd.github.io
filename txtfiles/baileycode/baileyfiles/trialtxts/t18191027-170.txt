            . I am a builder
. On the 28th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, Satchell informed me some men were on the top of my house; I immediately got some men, searched the house, and found the prisoner concealed just under the roof. He had thrown a piece of lead off, and more was rolled up ready to be thrown off - we secured him. He acknowledged having been there on the Monday night previous, and had taken an immense quantity. I saw the lead, and knew it to be mine. Two hundred and fifty houses have been built there, all of which have been robbed of lead within the last two years.

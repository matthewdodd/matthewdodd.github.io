THOMAS HOLLOWAY
. I am a builder, and live in North-street, Edgware-road. I went to Greenwich fair on the 2nd of June—I had a handkerchief with me, which I lost—this is it—it is mended—I know it well.





WILLIAM BIRCH
 (police-constable R 111.) I was on duty at Greenwich fair on the 2nd of June—I saw Jones, after making six different attempts, go to the prosecutor and take this handkerchief from his pocket—he gave it to Heston—she had been with him for an hour before, and I saw her make two attempts herself—I took this handkerchief from her, and took the prisoners.

Jones's Defence. I had not been in the fair five minutes; this woman was not with me at all.





ALEXANDER ANDREW SCOTT
. I am an inspector of police. I produce a certificate of Jones's former conviction—(read—Convicted 8th April, 1844; confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

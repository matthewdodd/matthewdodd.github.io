. The prisoner came to my shop at a quarter-past ten o'clock on the evening of the 25th of November - he looked out some things, desired them to be wrapped up, and when they were rolled round he said, "I want a pair of gloves" - my young man turned round for them, and the prisoner took the parcel and ran out; my young manpursued him, and I ran after him - he took the prisoner, who threw down the things in the street, and said, "D-n" you, if I can't get away I will spoil your property;" he was taken by the Police-officer - here are five pairs of stockings, and three yards of linen, in the parcel.
Prisoner. It was done entirely out of distress.

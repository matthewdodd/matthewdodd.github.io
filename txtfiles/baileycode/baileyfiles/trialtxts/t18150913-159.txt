            , we are linen drapers

. The prisoner at the bar came into the shop, on Tuesday the 2nd of July; she came in company with another woman; the other woman bought things to the amount of eight shillings and nine pence; there was a piece of muslin lying on the counter near them. I went to the other end of the shop for something; and on my return, I missed the muslin. Not knowing but it might have fallen, I went round the other side of the counter; and there I saw the prisoner with something in her apron, which on examination was my muslin. I sent for an officer, and gave her and themuslin into his charge.
(Muslin produced and sworn to.)

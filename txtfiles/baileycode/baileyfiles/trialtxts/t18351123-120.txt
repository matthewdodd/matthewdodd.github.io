JONATHAN TILLEY
. I keep a shoe shop in Ratcliff Highway. I saw the prisoner come to my shop on the 6th of November and take away pair of slippers—he got four doors off, and I caught him with them under his arm—I gave him to the policeman—these are them.

Prisoner. He takes a false oath—I never took them, nor had them on me—they were twoyards from me.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.*—


Transported for Seven Years.

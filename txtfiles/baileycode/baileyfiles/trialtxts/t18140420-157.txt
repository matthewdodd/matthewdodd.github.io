            . I am a journeyman sadler
. On the 12th of April, at half past nine in the evening, I was in the Strand


; I felt the prisoner snatch my watch out of my pocket. I catched him by the waist, and saw the watch in his hand. I being in a crowd, had not the opportunity of taking it out of his hand. He slipped his hand behind him, and the watch was taken out of his hand. I held him fast, and called out in the crowd, this man has got my watch. I took the prisoner into the first public-house I could see. I searched him, and found this watch upon him; it is not my watch. My watch was a silver watch, and this is silver. An officer then came, and took him to Bow-street office.

            . I am an officer. On the night of the illumination, I was in the Strand; I saw the prisoner make several attempts. He was brought to Bow-street office. I searched him, and found this snuff-box between his thighs, and his trowsers.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of this charge.

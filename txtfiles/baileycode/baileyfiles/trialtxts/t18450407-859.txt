JOHN BOYLE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
llth of April, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Alexander Baldie, from his person.






ALEXANDER BALDIE
. I am a solicitor's clerk, and live in Marylebone-street. About five o'clock, on the llth of April, I was going through Tokenhouse-yard—I heard the footsteps of three parties behind me—as soon as one had passed me his appearance excited my suspicion—I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—this produced is it—the three all started—the prisoner was one of them.





WILLIAM PERROTT
. I live in Half-moon-alley. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run past some carts in Coleman-street—as he was running past I saw him throw a handkerchief into a carpenter's shop door—I picked it up, and gave it to the officer—I am sure the prisoner is the person.





THOMAS PHELPS
 (policeman.) I have the handkerchief which Perrott gave me.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Coleman-street, and saw a great company of people running; I ran with them, got ahead of them, and was taken for the thief.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

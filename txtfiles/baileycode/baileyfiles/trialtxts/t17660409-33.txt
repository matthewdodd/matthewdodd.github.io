            . My son and I went to see the Blue-coat boys walk, on Tuesday was se'nnight; we were coming under the gate-way out of the 'Change


; 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Roberts 
               



             asked my son if he had lost his handkerchief; my son felt in his pocket, and said he had. Then said Roberts, This is the person that took it, and this received it, and seized them both by the collar. He that had it dropt it on the ground, and my son took it up. A great mob came about, and were for ducking them; but there was an officer who took them both in charge.


                  Samuel 
                  Roberts 
               



            . I went to see the children at the Royal Exchange walk; I saw 
               
                  Charles 
                  White 
               



             take the handkerchief out of the young man's pocket, and give it to Everett behind him. I immediately went to the young man, and discovered it; then I went and took the 2 prisoners by their collars, and said, This took it, and the other received it of him. As I had hold of them, I could not see the handkerchief fall, but it was taken up from under Everett.

                  Parsons 
               



            . I was walking towards the Royal Exchange; I saw a mob of people; they told me they had got some pickpockets; a person knowing me to be a constable, gave me charge of the 2 prisoners: I carried them to the Compter. Mr. Langfor's son swore the handkerchief was his property; and Mr. Roberts swore he saw White take the handkerchief out of the young man's pocket, and deliver it to Everett. I searched Everett, and on his thigh I found a bunch, and found a pair of mittins close to his thigh.

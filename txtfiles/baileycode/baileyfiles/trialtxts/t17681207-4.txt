            . I live in Holland-street, St. Ann's, Soho



. On Monday night was a fortnight, my wife told me somebody had got in at my parlour window, and stole my watch (a Pinchbeck watch and chain) from off the chimney-piece, where it usually lay. I made no enquiry about it, but gave it over for lost; but last Thursday, in the afternoon, Hawthorn the constable brought 
               
                  Adam 
                  Cliff 
               



             to me, he acknowledged he had stole it, in company with the prisoner Twyner; the next day Hawthorn brought the watch to me; on the Friday, Cliff, Twyner and Bird, were all before Justice Welch. There Cliff charged Twyner with having got in at my window, and stealing my watch, and carrying it to Bird, who gave him a guinea upon it, and said they should have a guinea more, when he had sold it. Bird at that time acknowledged they did come to him with the watch, and said, they told him they found it at Chelsea; and he did lend them a guinea upon it; this was all in my hearing.

            . Cliff told me, that Twyner had taken the watch, as the prosecutor has mentioned, and sold it to Bird. I went with a search-warrant to Bird's, and asked him after it; he acknowledged he had a watch left there for a guinea, he sent his maid up stairs for it; she brought it down. I told him I had a warrant to bring him before the Justice; he made some excuse, and said, he would not go then, but would soon follow me. I left him, he came accordingly. I found Twyner at Bird's house. He acknowledged he got in at the prosecutor's window, and took the watch out of the parlour.

                  Cliff 
               



            . One evening, I cannot tell the day, between five and six, we went and pulled up the sash of the window of the prosecutor's house. Twyner pulled his cloaths off, and got over the rails, and went in at the window, and took the watch; then we went to the Running Horse in St. Gyles's, where Twyner's brother lives: then he, his brother and I went all together to Bird's house; we got there by about seven; we gave Twyner's brother the watch, for him to tell Bird; we got it out of a window at Chelsea.
Q. What was your reason for that?
Cliff. Because, Bird would not have meddled with it, had he not thought it came from some distance off. Bird desired to look at it. He took us into a back room, and said he had not a great deal of money in the house; but he would lend him a guinea till it could be sold; then he would give him the remainder of the money. Then I was very ill, and staid there four nights.
Twyner's Defence.
I never saw the watch.
Bird's Defence.

             the prisoner, and his brother, came to my house, and called for liquor; then this watch was produced. Cliff said, he had no money to pay, unless he had some upon the watch. I did lend them some money upon it, taking them to be honest people.

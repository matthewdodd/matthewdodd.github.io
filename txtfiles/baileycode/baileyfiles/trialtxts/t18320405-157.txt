            . I am in the employ of Mr. Christopher Leaf, and his partner, in Watling-street



. On the 24th of February, the prisoner came to their warehouse; I served him in the morning with two pieces of thread web, and in the afternoon, with a gross of cannadine laces - I did not serve him with any thread or silk; in leaving the warehouse he had to ascend some stairs - I saw him stoop and open his bag: I then followed him up - I heard something fall; I still followed him, and when I saw him again, he was taking a parcel off a pile of thread on the stairs, and putting it into his bag; I asked him what he was going to do with it - he said he had picked it up on the stairs - I told him to come down, and called one of our young men; in the mean time he opened his bag, pulled out half a dozen of thread, and said he had picked it up - that was not the half-dozen which he had when I spoke to him; he must have had them before I saw him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you given the same account as you did before the Magistrate? A. Yes; he was out of my sight for some time in going up stairs - the threads lay in great piles on the stairs; they may fall if a person hits them - he has been in the habit of purchasing at our shop for years, I have understood - I had not served him with thread or silk that day.

            . I am an officer. I produce the thread and silk.

            . I had marked this parcel of thread, and had been serving some of this silk before he came - he was swinging his bag over his arm when he came in, and it appeared to be empty; this silk was found in his pocket at the watch-house - he said he had bought it of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, but he could not tell his name; this piece of web was found in his bag - I had not sold it to him; I know it by my mark on it.
Prisoner's Defence (written,) My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - On the 24th of February, I went to the prosecutor's ware-house, and bought a few articles, which I took with me in my bag; as I was coming out of the warehouse, I took up the half-dozen of thread, which I am now charged with stealing, as is customary with every person that goes into a wholesale warehouse to buy goods, if they see an article they think will suit them; knowing the witness Matthews was behind me, I was in the act of turning round to ask him the price - to my great surprise, he then charged me with the intention of stealing it, which, I most solemnly declare, I had not the slightest intention of doing; the witness Matthews also swears I had the half-dozen threads in my bag, which is a direct falsehood, as the bag was never off my arm. and as he was walking behind me all the way, it was impossible I could have put it in without his knowledge.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and from information, I went to his house, at No. 3, Well-street, Mile-end - I saw the name of Postle over the door; I found the articles there, which I now produce -I got a bill of the prisoner's shop there.

                  BONYARD
               



            . I have known the prisoner some years - I have bought goods at his shop; I have been there with him; it is in Well-street; I think he gave me one of these bills of his shop.

            . I was in December last in the employ of Mr. Christopher Leaf and his partner - I know this crape dress formed part of their stock; three of them had been out to a customer, and were returned; I saw them, and counted them; in less than half an hour I missed one - I have referred to the books, and find the prisoner had been there that day - I did not keep the books; I can swear this is one of the three; the other two are in our possession now; I had never sold one of this description.
Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Have you not many crapes of this colour? A. It is a common brown, but this is a real China crape - it was a bad black; I was compelled to have it dyed, and it would take no colour but this; I saw it on the 10th of December - I can swear no one ever purchased any of these dresses; they are under my care particularly.

            . I am in the employ of Leaf and Co. I know these ribbons formed part of their stock - they are not in the state in which they would be sold, not being blocked; these are what are called spindled; they have never been unrolled - I knew they were ours by the pattern; we have several manufacturers who supply us.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean no other house has these patterns? A. Yes; we purchase the whole of a pattern, but another house may have a similar pattern.


                  JOHN 
                  ABLETT
               



            . I know these forty-six parcels of threads have been in Leaf and Co.'s stock - I cannot swear that they were stolen - I buy the buttons, and Iknow these formed a part of our stock; I know they have not been sold to the prisoner, and I do not recollect selling them at all in such a quantity; the prisoner may have bought a gross or two, but here are nearly two hundred gross.
Cross-examined. Q. But you may have sold all these buttons to different people? Yes; some of these have marks on them - I cannot swear that some of these were not sold to the prisoner.
MR. BARRY. Q. Have you taken stock lately? A. Yes, and we found forty-three dozens of thread deficient, and twenty-seven dozens were found at the prisoner's.
JURY. Q. Did you give bills of parcels with what you sold? A. Yes, always.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was in the habit of purchasing goods at different houses, as well as at the prosecutor's, and as he had paid ready money for them, he did not have bills of parcels.

            . I live at No. 11, Duke-street, Spitalfields - I am a tailor. I have known the prisoner about six years; I have often been with him at sales; I remember something about his buying a crape dress; I think this is it - yes, I can swear it is - he brought it to my house about eight months back; I saw him did for this and for two white dresses in Petticoat-lane - all sorts of things come to Petticoat-lane; it was long before December; I think it was about August - I know this is the dress; I had it in my hand the same evening at my place, about two hours after he bought it.
COURT. Q. Are you a judge of dyeing? A. No; I cannot tell whether this has been dyed once or twice; I have seen a great many shawls of this description; I noticed the pattern of that which was brought to my house- it was what I call a zig-zag; the border might be about twelve inches - I understood it was a shawl.

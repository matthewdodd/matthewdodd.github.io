William Hall. I am a coach-maker
 at Greenwich


: on the 28th of March I lost a pair of coach harnesses out of my yard: I advertised them; I found the harnesses on a pair of horses in the street by accident at Charing Cross. The coachman told me he bought them of a man for his mistress, and that she lived in Great Marlborough Street; which I found to be true.

            . My mistress ordered me to buy a pair of harnesses; the prisoner brought a pair into Marlborough street, and offered them to one Clarage; I bought them for half a guinea; when I found they were stolen, he came afterwards; I asked him if he had any bridles; he said he would bring me one on the Saturday; I took him directly: I have three witnesses here to prove I gave him the full value for them.

            . I was by when the prisoner sold these harnesses to Lovat. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

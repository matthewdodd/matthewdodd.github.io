. The prisoner came into our shop, yesterday was three weeks, about one in the day, to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I was in the shop by myself: while she was looking at some handkerchiefs, a man came in and wanted to look at some garters; he went to the other counter, and I call'd for somebody to come to me in the shop: the prisoner bid very low, and out she went; the man went out also. A woman came in, and said she thought I had had some shop-lifters; I looked, and missed a parcel of handkerchiefs, which she had just been looking at. I sent the maid after her, and was informed she went towards Grub-street: she was brought back with the handkerchiefs. (Produced in court:) These are the five handkerchiefs I had shewed to her; there is my mark upon them, our property.

            . I was coming by Mrs. Carew's house, and heard she had been robb'd: a little boy came and said the maid had got fight of the prisoner; she desired me to go and assist. I went up into Chiswell-street, and there was the maid; she said the woman was gone on, dressed in a black gown, and a striped bed-gown over it: I went on, and overtook her in Moorfields, and stopped her till the maid came up: in bringing her back to the shop, she strove all she could to drop the handkerchiefs, but she could not. When she came within about three hundred yards of Mrs. Carew's house, she pulled them out of her bosom, or pocket, and gave them to me, and said, there are the handkerchiefs. I brought them and her to the shop, and delivered the handkerchiefs to Mrs. Carew; these are the same. I put the letters B G upon them; here it is.

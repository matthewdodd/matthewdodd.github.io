            . I keep an oil and chandler's shop
 in Cow-cross


; the prisoner was my servant
, she was a month all but two days with me; I took her out of the London workhouse.
Q. How old do you take her to be?
Gossage. I take her to be about 14 years old; she ran away on the 11th of March, at night; I missed the money after she was gone; we enquired after her, and had her advertised; after that I found her in bed at the Griffin-inn in the Borough; I charged her with taking my money out of my drawer; she acknowledged she had, and gave me 16 s. and 9 d. I asked her what she had done with the rest; she said she had bought some new clothes with it, and gave them me in a bundle; (produced in court) I took her before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , who examined her; she told him every thing, and what she had bought, and the price of each article; the Justice made a bill of it, and it came to upwards of 4 l. I asked her for the green purse it was in; she gave it me (produced and deposed to.)
Mrs. Gossage. I am wife to the prosecutor; I put this money, 4 l. and upwards in a drawer, but did not lock it; it was in a green purse; after the prisoner was gone, we missed the money.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

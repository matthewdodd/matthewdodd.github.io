            . My husband's name is Joseph, I heard the prisoner was taken up and carried before my Lord Mayor for striping a child in Bartholomew close. I, having had one stript, went there to see if I could find out whether or no it was she that stripp'd mine. I there taxed her with it, upon which she owned it, and also that she had stripped two others: And since she has owned that my child's stays and stockings were stopped on Clerkenwell-green: I went and found them out, and the person is here to give his evidence.
Q. to the prisoner. How old are you?
Prisoner. I shall be eleven years of age next monday
Q. to Eliz. Jackson. Did you know the prisoner before?

E. Jackson. I did, we live all in one street, she is an apprentice to her aunt.
Q. Where was your child stripped?
E. Jackson. My child was found in the fields with only two green petticoats and her cap on, and by telling her name and place of abode was brought home to me.
Q. What things were missing from off her?
E. Jackson. A Linen sack, her stays, skirt, shift, stockings, shoes, a pin cloth from before her, and a topknot.

I went over a ditch to it; he said, Don't meddle with it; I said I would. I found it with only one petticoat on and another in its hand. I took that and pinned it over her shoulders; then I asked her who she belonged to, and her name. She said her name was

I did not know whose child it was then. The prisoner was stopped. I went and took hold of the child. I then asked the prisoner if she stripped the child, she said yes, and that she had proffered the things to sale which she took off the child back.
Q. What was taken from the child?
Dawson. A coat and skirt, (produced in court.) Then a gentleman came and asked me if I was the father of that child, I said no, but I was servant to the child's father. A constable was sent for, and he was charged with the prisoner, and we took her before my Lord-mayor, and from thence to the Counter.
Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before that time?
Dawson. No, never in my life.

            . I live in Spitalfields


: my wife hired the prisoner in the market, on the 12th of October; one the 12th of November we left her in care of the house while we went out, and when we came home the things mentioned, and more, were missing, and she also. After that I heard she was in Clerkenwell-bridewell for another offence; my wife and I went there: she confessed she took the things away, and the box in which they were; and the man she kept company with broke the box to pieces; she mentioned the things in particular, and said she wore my wife's best cap the next day.
Anne his wife confirmed the evidence he had given.

            : the prisoner came to live servant
 with me the 3d of April; on the 5th she asked me to let her go out; the next day I missed a ruffle shirt and a long lawn frock; I did not suspect the prisoner at that time; she staid with me a fortnight and was scarce ever sober. On the Saturday fortnight I found her drunk; I told her I could not put up with it. I went to look up my things she had washed for me, and then I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I charged her with it, and she said I wanted to hurt her character; I told her if she would tell me where they were it should be no expence to her; she then said she supposed I would swear her life away. She took away all her things in the course of the evening, and at ten at night she was going away; a young woman clapped to the door; she said it was at our peril to keep her in; I then opened the door and let her go. On Monday my husband got a warrant and she was taken and brought before Justice Welch; there were 28 pawnbrokers duplicates found upon her; she owned at the justice's she took the things, and said she did it through necessity.

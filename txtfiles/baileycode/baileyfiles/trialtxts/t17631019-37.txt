            . This day se'nnight I left my scarlet cloak in my boat, at the Old Swan stairs


, when I returned my boat was taken away to another stairs, and my cloak taken out of her; I was told the prisoner was seen to row her up towards the Three Cranes. I took him up last night; when I was taking him to Justice Fielding's he wanted to make it up, and said he would give me four or five guineas, and owned he had old the cloak to a Jew in Duke's Place, but would not, for an hundred guineas, divulge the Jew's name; after that he told me if I cast him I should not have a boat to swim in. I never had my cloak again
George Bulmore. I was charged with the prisoner last night, I heard him own he had took the cloak, and had sold it to a Jew in Duke's Place, but would not say what his name was.

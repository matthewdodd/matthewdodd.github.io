conducted the Prosecution.






THOMAS BOULTON
. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Morgan's-lane, Tooley-street, on Monday, the 27th of March, from nine o'clock at night till six o'clock next morning—I know the prosecutors' warehouses, they were all safe in the morning, when I went off duty at six o'clock—I returned again at nine o'clock the same evening—it is my habit to examine the fastenings every night, as I come on my beat—I did so to the prosecutors' warehouse, a little after nine o'clock, and found this padlock hanging on the staple of the door, with the bottom upwards—it was unlocked, but hanging as if it was locked—I tried it, and found it came open—the outside iron bar was up as usual, and the lock on the staple—I looked about a little, and saw Rice, standing about twenty yards off—he walked past me, close by me, and when he had passed me, six or seven yards, he turned back again, and examined a bill that was on the door, and as he walked away from the bill, he asked me if the door was unlocked—I said, "Why?"—he said, "For nothing"—I asked him if he belonged to the premises—he said, "Oh no," and walked about eight or ten yards, and turned up against the wall, as if for a necessary purpose—when he left, I went and examined the place where he had been standing, and found it perfectly dry—he walked opposite the public-house adjoining the ware-house, and went in at the front-door—after speaking to the watchman I went back to the warehouse-door, which I had left about four minutes to call the watchman—on my return, I found the padlock had been turned up the other way, and locked in its usual way—I saw Rice again in about half-an-hour, coming down Morgan's-lane, towards the warehouse—I said something to him—I did not say it would be better or worse if he said any thing—I said I should take him to the station, on suspicion of doing something wrong—he said, "Very well," he would go along with me, which he did quietly—I asked if he had got any keys about him, he said, "No"—I said, "I dare say you have no objection to walk down to the warehouse-door," which he did, and the watchman asked him if he had any keys about him—he said "No" again—the watchman said, "If you have got the key, you had better give it up"—he said he had not got it—I took him to the station—on the road to the station I saw him try to pass something to a boy who he met—I looked to see what it was in his hand, and saw it was a key, with this wood to it, marked D 1—I took him to the station, took the key, went back to the warehouse, and found it would unlock the lock—I unlocked the door with it, took the padlock off, turned the iron bolt down, and found the door fastened inside—I could not get in—we got a crow-bar put in between the two doors, (it is a double door,) and wrenched the bolt back—it took nearly an hour to do that—when we got inside we found the prisoners Lodan and Gravestock inside, standing behind a crane—I told them to come to the station, and asked if there was any body besides them inside—they said there was not—I locked the door, took the key with me, and took them to the station—they said it was a bad job—I came back, and found four tin cans in the warehouse, holding about four gallons each—two of them were full of oil—I found a great

many barrels of oil in the warehouse, and the remains of a candle which had been burning—my brother constable picked it up from behind where the prisoners had been standing—I was with Berry when he examined the barrels—I found one side of one barrel was wet and the other dry, as if the oil had been running down from a spile-hole—here are two phials, containing a sample of oil, one from each of the full tin cans—and Berry has a sample from two different barrels, both of which appeared to be wet.

Lodan. When I came up the lane the door was open.

COURT. Q. What time passed from the time you found the door unfastened till you found it locked again? Witness. Three or four minutes—I saw nobody there but Rice—I could not see whether there was a candle burning inside while the door was shut—I left a watchman there while I went to the station, and during the half-hour while I was away looking for Rice—the number of the warehouse is D No. 1, the same as is on the key—there is no door into the warehouse but this one.





JAMES JONES
. I am foreman to Messrs. Emanuel and Thomas Silva, wharfingers. I know the warehouse D No. 1—there were thirty-five casks of oil in it, some was brown seal, and some pale seal oil—on Wednesday, the 23rd of March, I had been at the warehouse—I then had this key with the label now produced—when I left I locked the door, and hung the key in the counting-house, in its proper place—I had no occasion to go to it after that before the discovery, nor had anybody else to my knowledge—if the key had remained in its proper place, it should have been hanging up in the counting-house—Rice was a weekly servant of Messrs. Silva—I did not know him before he came into their service—I have known Lodan many years—he was occasionally employed by master, but seldom—he knew all our warehouses very well—I do not know Gravestock—we keep candles in the counting-house—the candle which was found did not belong to us—we do not use candles in the warehouse, but oil.

COURT. Q. Was Rice in your master's employment at this time? A Yes, but not Lodan—Rice would have to come to the counting-house in the course of his employment, and would take the key, if he wanted it, as I should myself—there was an old bolt to the warehouse-door inside, but I did not know it till this happened.





JAMES BERRY
. I am cellarman to Pilcher and Co., oil-merchants, in Morgan's-lane. I have dipped two barrels of oil at the warehouse of the prosecutors, D No. 1, to see what was gone—they appeared to be deficient—I took a sample from the two barrels, which I produce—I dipped several—they differed in colour—these two were what I call straw-oil, and corresponded with that found in the cans—the ground was wet with oil—here are two samples from the cans—in my judgment they are the same quality as these samples taken from the cans—they are all straw-oil, but one barrel is paler than the other—the oil in. one barrel corresponds with one can, and the other with the other.





JOSHUA BROWNELL
. I am clerk to the prosecutors. I know nothing of Gravestock—I was not present when the barrels were gauged, but I have the gauge from the sworn gauger in the City—I was present when the barrels were first landed, and then saw him gauge them—there was a much larger cargo—I know the two barrels in question were quite full in February, and made complete—from the examination I have made since, there is a deficiency of seven or eight gallons, which would be about what the two cans

would hold—the total deficiency in the thirty-five casks is eighty gallons—Lodan was occasionally employed by my master—on this day, or the night of the 28th, Rice had not the slightest business with the key—he had been employed there six or seven years regularly.

COURT. Q. YOU say the casks were filled up in February? A. Yes—none had been sold from them—it is usual, when a quantity of oil is purchased, for the cooper to come and fill up the casks, as there is a wastage—there could not be a waste of this quantity since February, as the casks were in good condition—it was impossible there could be much leakage—there might be a very trifling one.

Lodan. The two four-gallon cans were quite full; the premises were not broken open. Witness. The four-gallon cans did not belong to my employer, and were not there on the 23rd.





JAMES JONES

re-examined. I saw these two gimlets found in the cellar—they had no business there—I saw them compared with the holes in the casks—I, did not see any which agreed with the gimlets—I saw no fresh holes made there.

COURT. Q. Did you see any hole out of which the oil could be drawn? A. I did not—the spile-holes did not appear enlarged—the place where the policeman said oil appeared to have been running, might have been from the rolling of the casks.





THOMAS BOULTON

re-examined. The wet was from the spile-hole—it appeared to have run from the spile-hole and from the bung-hole—both are on the top of the cask—they lay lengthways—the cask had been rolled over on its side a little, and then the oil would run out—there was a little tow in the spile-hole, which appeared very wet—the holes were about the size which this gimlet would bore—the casks seemed wet down the side, as if the oil had ran from it—one side was perfectly dry—if it had been rolled right over, both sides would have been wet.





JAMES BERRY

re-examined. Q. If they had bored at one end of the cask with the gimlet, there was air enough to let the oil run out? A. Yes—there was a vent to the cask.
(Dennis Ragan, a shoemaker, of Snow's-fields, Bermondsey; James Macfeeney, undertaker, of Snow's-fields; James Doughty, a shoemaker, of No. 4, Union-yard, Tooley-street; and—Scott, glass-cutter, of Holland-street; gave the prisoner Rice a good character. Thomas Barker and William Gregory gave Lodan a good character.)

: On the 12th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I took a bundle of demy paper to serve a customer a quire out of it, and being too heavy to lift up, I left it on the counter till my husband came in; I went into the parlour and fat down to my work; after some time; I observed something waver in my sight; I looked up, and saw a man in a blue coat going out of the shop; I got up, went into the shop, looked towards the window, and saw a man in a brown coat, with a bundle of paper in his arms, before him; I ran to the door, holloaed out, stop thief, two or three times; the man in a blue coat ran past me out of the shop, and said, softly, b - if you, run; I could but just hear it; we all got to the step of the door about together; the man in brown threw the paper away into the kennel; I turned round, and collared the man in blue, and said, you rascal, you are one of them; he immediately answered, you b - h, don't you say so again, for if you do, I'll cut your bl - y eyes out; I had him by the right arm, and he told me he would cut my bl - y life out if he could get at his knife; I held him till he attempted to put his hand into his pocket to get his knife, and then he threatened me so, that I was obliged to let him go; I never saw them afterwards till I saw the man in blue before the Magistrate the next day.

HENRY RICHARDSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of July, 6 handkerchiefs, value 30s., the goods of 



Isaac Simpson.






WILLIAM HOLLIDAY
. I am shopman to Isaac Simpson, of Ludgate-hill. At half-past eight o'clock, on the 23d of July, the prisoner came and asked for some cravats—he took a chair, and sat by the counter, while I was attending to a customer—I observed him take off his hat, and put some handkerchiefs into it—I then served the prisoner—he gave me half-a-crown—I said I had not got change—I went next door, called a lad, and sent for an officer—a scuffle ensued—he attempted to take off his hat, and throw the handkerchiefs among some others, but I prevented it, and saw them fall from his hat—these are them.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. These are the handkerchiefs? A. Yes. I did not say before the Magistrate that I could not speak to them, because they had fallen among others—there was a person, who I suppose to be an associate—this is the piece he threw down—it has not been selected since—three or four fell with it, but this peice did not fall among them.





GODFREY CROFT
. I was called in—I know the prisoner by sight—I saw the handkerchiefs in his hat as he knocked it off his head, and saw this piece fall to the ground.

Prisoner. He selected this piece from others; if the officer was here he could prove it.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

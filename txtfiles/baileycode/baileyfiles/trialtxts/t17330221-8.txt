John Crow. I live in Cary-street, Westminster


. The Prisoner had been my Servant
 8 or 9 Days, and went away on the 14th of June last, in order to go for a Month to see her Friends in Shropshire. My House was robbed in the Night between the 22d and 23d of June, but none of the outward Part of my House being broken, I imagin'd that the Person who robb'd me had got in, in the Evening, and lay conceal'd till I and my Family were a bed, and then committed the Fact, and went out at the Door, for the Door was found a jar in the Morning. I had some Suspicion of the Prisoner, because she was seen in the Neighbourhood the Day before, and was well acquainted with my House. Upon which I went to her Lodging, and heard that she did not lie there that Night as I was robb'd. On the 28th of September I went after her to Shrewsbury, and -
Court. Why did you stay so long before you pursued her?
Crow. Because I expected her up again in a Month, and so thought to have saved that Trouble and Charge; but hearing she had taken a House at Oswistry in Shropshire, in order to settle there, I went, as I was saying, to Shrewsbury, where I got a Warrant to search her House. When I came thither, I found her at Home, and as soon as she saw me, she open'd a Chest, and took out a Pair of Stays that I had lost, and gave 'em to me. Jenny, says I, Where's your Mistress's Cloak and Hat? She said she'd fetch them; and so she did. And then she took the Tea-Spoons and Tongs out of the Chest, but told me, they were none of mine. I believe they were the same that I lost; but I can't swear to them, because they were not mark'd. I charg'd her with stealing these, and other Goods from me; but she said, those Goods and 20 l. were given her, by the Person who did the Robbery, that she might not discover it, and that she had nothing that belong'd to me, but what she had return'd to me; but next Day (Sept. 29.) when she was carry'd before the Justice, she said, she had bought the Goods; and her Father and Brother coming to intercede for her, I shew'd them a List of what I had lost, and ask'd them, if they knew any thing of those Goods? They said, Yes; and (while her Father staid) her Brother went and fetch'd my Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches, and she said, she bought them too.

            . The Prisoner went from me June 14, and came on Wednesday, June 21, to take her Leave of me, and said, she must lye that Night in the City, near the Inn from whence she was to go with the Carrier, that she might be ready in the Morning, but she was seen in my Neighbourhood all the next Day; I was robbed that Night, and we went out of Town next Morning.

            . I am the Prisoner's Half-Sister, and being to go down with her into the Country, she agreed to come and lye with me at my Lodging the Night before she went; but she did not come till 4 o'Clock in the Morning, and then she hurry'd me to get up and go to the Inn, tho' I told her, the Pack-Horses did not go out till Two in the Afternoon; she had carried her Box before to the Inn.

            , I live in White's-Alley, Mrs. Corbet lodg'd with me, and the Prisoner bid me tell her that she would come to her by Five in the Evening, but she did not come till Four in the Morning, and between 5 and 6, she and her Sister Corbet, went out and took Coach in Chancery-Lane to go to the Inn.

            . I lodg'd at the Prosecutor's. On Thursday the 22d of June, my Maid let me in about 11 at Night: I told her, I suppos'd Mr. Crow and his Wife were gone to Bed, because I saw a Light in their Chamber; and therefore, I bid her fasten the Door, and I staid in the Entry while she did it.

            , the Prosecutor's Servant. I came down first on Friday Morning (June 23,) and found the Street Door standing a-jar.
The Prisoner in her Defence, pretended that her Master (the Prosecutor) had given her the Goods to lye with her, and that she had miscarried by him. The Jury 


               acquited her of the Burglary, and found her guilty of the Felony only
            .

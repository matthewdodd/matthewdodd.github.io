ANN DINGLEY
. I am daughter of James Dingley, a hosler, in Wych-street. On the 9th of October I heard a noise and came down—I found my mother with Griffiths, and soon after a gentleman brought Jones into the shop—there were 11 pairs of stockings on the counter.





WHITFIELD BUTLER
. I live in Cursitor-street, and am an actor. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 9th of October I was passing and saw Griffiths coming out of the prosecutor's shop with a bundle in his hand—I caught him—he dropped the bundle—I took it up, and gave him to another person while I went after Jones, who had then got into another street—he had been looking through the window while Griffiths was in the shop, watching him, and when Griffiths came out Jones ran off—I ran and caught Jones.





WILLIAM WEST
 (police-constable F106.) I took Jones—he said he did not know the other.





THOMAS WHITEHEAD
 (police-constable F 53). I was on duty between six and seven o'clock that evening—I saw both the prisoners in company

—they went and looked in at different shops—I followed them until they got off my beat.

JONES**—

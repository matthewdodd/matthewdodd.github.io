 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of December, 1 piece of handkerchiefs, containing 7 handkerchiefs, value 28s., the goods of 



Edward Boyle.






JOHN FRAY
. I manage the business for Mr. Edward Boyle, in Farringdon-street. The prisoner came there with a man on the 29th of December—they looked at some black silk handkerchiefs, but bought nothing—the prisoner was brought back by an officer soon after, with these handkerchiefs—they had been in our shop a little before, and are the property of Mr. Edward Boyle.





FREDERICK PRINCE
 (City police-constable No. 79.) I saw the prisoner and a man go into the shop—I saw them come out again, and followed them—I knew the prisoner, and asked what she had got under her shawl—she said, "Nothing"—she put her right hand under her shawl, and threw these handkerchiefs behind her—I took them up and took her.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

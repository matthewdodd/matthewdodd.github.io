            . We are much infested with pick-pockets on Holborn Hill; I being a constable, I saw the prisoner and two others, between the King's Arms and the Swan. We watched them. The prisoner took a gentleman's handkerchief from his pocket. He was laid hold on, and I saw him throw the handkerchief up against a house. I followed the gentleman, and told him his pocket was picked. He came back and looked at the handkerchief, and said, it was his own. When we got back to the end of Shoe-Lane, there were no less than (I believe) fifty; one said, D - n you, you shall not take him; another said the same. I was struck by three of them together. Mr. Bell, another constable, and several other people, came to my assistance, and we got the prisoner into a shop; had not assistance came, I had been used very ill; I know not but I had lost my life in attempting to secure him; but Mr. Bell and I determine if possible to break the knot of them.

Prisoner's Defence.
As I was going up the hill, there was a heap of boys and men; a person ran away, and they said, I picked a man's pocket.

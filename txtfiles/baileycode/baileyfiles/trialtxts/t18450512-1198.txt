GEORGE STONE
. I live in South-street, Greenwich. On the 14th of May I was in Greenwich fair—some one spoke to me—I turned, and saw my handkerchief in Sullivan's hand—this is it—I should think I had had it safe half an hour before—I laid hold of Sullivan—the officer made a snatch at the same time, and he got the handkerchief.





JOHN CARPENTER
 (police-constable R 84.) On the 14th of May, I was at Greenwich—I saw the prisoners together—I watched them for half an hour—I saw Sullivan go behind several gentlemen, followed by Collins, who spread out her gown, while Sullivan felt their pockets—I then saw Sullivan go behind the prosecutor—Collins was close behind him, and spread out her gown to hide him from view—I saw Sullivan take the handkerchief—he was in the act of giving it to Collins at the time I took it from him.

Collins's Defence. I never saw it.

COLLINS—


GUILTY
. Aged 20.—



Confined Six Months.

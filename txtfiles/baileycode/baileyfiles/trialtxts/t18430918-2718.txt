ANN SULLIVAN,



 HARRIET SETTER
, and 




MARY FLANNAGAN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
6th of Sept, 26 yards of printed cotton, value 15s., the goods of 



David Silvanus and another; and that Sullivan had been before convicted of felony.






DAVID SILVANUS
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Whitechapel. On the 6th of Sept., the prisoners came to my shop and asked for print dresses—I commenced showing them some, and at the same time they took three dresses off the counter—one of them commenced concealing a dress as soon as she came into the shop—Sullivan then began kicking Flannagan, and said, "Why don't you tie up your shoes?"—I jumped over the counter, and shook Flannagan, and two dresses fell from her—I shook Setter, and a dress fell from her—I found nothing on Sullivan, but she offered to pay for the dress she was looking at—I then gave them a good thumping, and sent them out—these are the dresses—they belong to me and my partner—the prisoners had not been a minute in my shop before this took place.






THOMAS BURCHAM
 (police-constable H 33.) I produce a certificate of Sullivan's former conviction, which I got from the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell—( read)—she is the person who was convicted.

            . I am a carpenter
, and live in Little Crompton-street; I was at work at a house in Salisbury street in the Strand


; I went to dinner on the 29th of January, and coming to work again, I met the prisoner coming out at the door of the house where I was at work; I perceived something under his coat; I asked him what he had got there; he said, a saw; I desired to look at it; I took it from under his coat, and found it to be my property, which I had been using not an hour before; (produced and deposed to.)

            . I am a carpenter; I was with the prosecutor when he took the saw from under the prisoner's coat.
Prisoner's defence.
I went into that house; there was a man there, I asked him for a job; he said he could not help me to a job, but he gave me that saw, and said, I might get a job hard by.
Q. to prosecutor. Did the prisoner say to you how he came by the saw?
Prosecutor. No, he did not.

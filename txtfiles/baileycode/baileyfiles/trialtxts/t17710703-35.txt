: I was sent for by Mr. Phillips on the second instant; he informed me he had detected a person with some of my pots; I went to his house, the Granby's head in Chick-lane, there he produced two of my pots; the prisoner owned before Justice Girdler she had been, at my house and took the pots from the table; upon her making that confession, I said, I rather wanted to come at the receivers, for she said a person had employed her to steal as many pots as she could, and was to pay her six-pence a day for all she got.

            . I keep a public house, the Marquis of Granby, in Chick-lane: on the second of this month, about half past twelve in the forenoon, the prisoner came into my house for a pint of beer; she sat down in a box at the end of a table, there were other people besides myself present; one of them said she had a suspicion the prisoner was doing something not right; we found'd pot tied to her side, she, attempted to get out, but we stopt her: there were two more pint-pot in each of her pockets; I sent for an officer and took her into custody, the pots had Mr. Smith's mark upon them; I sent for him, (the pots produced and deposed to by the prosecutors)
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all of the pots.

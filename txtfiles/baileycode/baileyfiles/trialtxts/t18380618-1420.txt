On the 21st of May I was in Newgate-street, between ten and eleven o'clock—I felt something at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner—I missed my handkerchief, and accused him with having it—he said he had not—I called the officer, who took him; and as he was crossing the street I saw this handkerchief drop—I took it up—it could not have fallen from any one but the prisoner—it is mine.





JAMES DOUGHTY

Prisoner. I was driven to it by want—I had no work.

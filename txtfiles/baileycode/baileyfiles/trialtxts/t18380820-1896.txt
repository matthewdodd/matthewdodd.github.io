THOMAS BAYLIS
. I keep the Griffin public-house, in Liquorpoud-street. I have lost a great number of pots—this pint pot (looking at one) is mine-from information, I went after the prisoner, on the 28th of July—he was pointed out to me-as soon as he saw me he ran—I pursued, and called, "Stop thief"—he was stopped—I collared him and brought him back—I asked what he had done with my pot—he said he had not had one—I told him he had—the boy saw him throw it down, and he took it up.





JOHN RUSSELL
. I live in Vine-street, Liquorpond-street I saw the prisoner take up two pots from opposite Mr. Baylis'—I gave information, and he ran down Portpool-lane—he threw one pot away—I took it up—I did not see him throw it away.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not say that a boy put it against the board? A. Yes, so he did.





CHARLES COLE
. I saw the prisoner throw down the pot-Russell picked it up.





WILLIAM GRAY
 (police-constable G 199.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the man.

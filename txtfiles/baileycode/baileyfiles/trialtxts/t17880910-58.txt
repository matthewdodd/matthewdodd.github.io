             sworn.
I live in Williams's-court, No. 4; on Friday last was a week my house was broke open; I went to bed at half past ten, this happened at nine.
Was you at home? - No, I was out; I fastened my door and my windows; I went out a few minutes before nine; I was not gone out ten minutes; I secured every thing fast.
Was it dark then? - It was about an hour after candle light; when I returned there was a woman that lodges with me went with me, and I saw my door wide open, and one stocking and one cap.
Had you locked the door when you went out? - I did not lock my door, I lost the key, but I latched it, which is as good as a lock, I opened it with a bit of stick; the woman that lives with me was at the door before me, and she picked up a stocking and a cap; I had that cap and stocking in the bundle among all the rest, and I missed a whole bundle of wet linen, as mentioned in the indictment; (recites them) the things are all here, they were in my custody for washing, some of them, and the rest are my property.
Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. What time did you come home that evening? - I came home in the course of ten minutes after I went out.
Was not it light enough to see without a candle at that time? - No, sir, it was not, I had a light half an hour.
Can you take upon yourself to say, that you certainly latched the door, might not it have missed? - Yes, I did.

             sworn.
I came home with Mrs. Johnson, and the door was wide open, and there was a candle lighted, and there was a stocking and a cap laying just on the inside of the door, and the things were all gone from the table.

             sworn.
I am one of the officers; here is a bundle that the prisoner Young dropt about half past nine in the Back-lane, St. George's, near Rosemary-lane; there were four people, the two prisoners and two others; I saw the two prisoners, each with a bundle; I caught hold of one, and tried to catch hold of Young, he slipt my hand and dropt this bundle.
How far is this from the prosecutrix's? - I believe it is about half a mile.
Was it the same night her house was robbed? - Yes; Mayne, the other officer, took the prisoner Wooding.
(The things produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner Young. Did you see me in the Back-lane that night? - I had hold of his coat, he slipt me; I know the prisoner very well, I cannot be deceived.

                   MAYNE
               



             sworn.
This bundle I took from the prisoner Wooding, the same night between nine andten; Dawson and me were in the Back-lane, and we met the two prisoners, Anderson and another man; I laid hold of Wooding, he had this bundle in his hand, he made resistance, he dropt this bundle; it might be half after nine; the prisoner Young, had another bundle in his hand, but what he did with it I cannot take upon myself to say.
(These things deposed to.)
Prosecutrix. I cannot undertake to swear to these things and die the next moment.
PRISONER YOUNG's DEFENCE.
I was in Oxford-road the same night at the sign of the George, and that man never saw me that night.
Court. Have you any witnesses? - Not now, I had some yesterday.
The prisoner Wooding called five witnesses, who all gave him a good character.

JOHN PEARCE
. I am a labourer. On 13th July I was at Hammersmith with Gomm, who gave me a pair of trowsers to take to where we work—going up Hammersmith, I was shoved off the pavement, and the trowsers snatched from under my arm—I did not see who it was—Eliza Godfrey ran after the person, and stopped him—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and asked him what made him snatch the trowsers from me—he said, "To take care of them"—I asked him to give me them—he said he would see me b—first—I called the police.





WILLIAM CHICK
 (policeman, T 270). Pearce gave the prisoner into custody on 13th July, in King-street, Hammersmith—on the way to the station,

he acknowledged he was guilty, and hoped I would make it at light as I could for him; he had been out of work a long time—I found these trowsers on him (produced).





ELI SAMUEL GOMM
. These are my trowsers—I gave them to Pearce, to take for me.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up on the pavement.





WILLIAM SHORT
 (policeman, T 263). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction here—(read—Convicted June, 1849, having been before convicted—confined nine months)—I was present—he is the man.

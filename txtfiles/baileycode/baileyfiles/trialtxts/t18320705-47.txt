            . On the 22nd of May I saw the prisoner go into Archdeacon's shop, in Mile-end-road


, when the first shutter was taken down, a little after seven o'clock in the morning - this caddy stood on a pianoforte, and he took it off, and walked away; I called to the shopman, and the prisoner began to run - I called Stop thief! and ran after him; he threw the caddy down - I took it up; he was not out of my sight till he was taken.

                  John 
                  Jackson 
               



            . I live at Edmonton; I was in Holbourn pretty much in liquor, on the 26th of January between twelve and one at night; I could not get in at my lodging in Ormond-yard, I was strolling about, and could not light of any body where I could lie.
Q. What are you?
Jackson. I am a farmer; I was somewhere near the Coach and Horses in Holbourn


, and these three women at the bar laid hold of me, and led me into a house in a court and stripped me; they promised to take me to some good lodging; I never saw them before; there was a candle lighted; they pulled my boots and breeches off, they flung my boots to the other side the house; there were five guineas and a half and two quarter guineas in a purse in my breeches, they took them away; I believe 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clifford 
               



             stood watch while the others stripped me, and put the candle out; after they left me I hollooed out for the watch, he came; I was sitting on a bad bed in a bad house.
Q. Did you pull your breeches off, or did they?
Jackson. I believe they assisted me, or I could not have got them off; I am sure I did not give them my breeches; the watchman took me to the watch-house.


                  Anne 
                  Benson 
               



            . My husband keeps the Coach and Horses in Holbourn; Mr. Jackson brought three women to the bar, and I served them with a glass of gin a little after twelve at night; whether the prisoners are the women I know not, they did not stay above three minutes; he did not appear to be so drunk as he seems to say.

                  Bishop 
               



            . A watchman came in and said there has been a robbery committed in Jacob's-court, that is on the back of Blackboy-alley; I went there and found him very drunk; some of the watchmen helped him on with his boots; we took him to the watch-house in Coldbath-fields; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clifford 
               



             was taken and brought in about five; I made her pull out her money; she took out a box with a 5 s. 3 d. and 26 d. the farmer said she was one of the women that robbed him; I went and borrowed a pair of breeches for him; we took her before the Justice, she was committed; going along, she confessed that money was the farmer's, and that Anne her sister gave her that and the breeches in Smithfield, and she was afraid the watch would take the breeches from her, and she ran down Cock-lane, and there in a little court flung the breeches away; we went and enquired of the officer, who told me they were found there, and we got them again, and the farmer swore to them; the other two prisoners were taken on the Monday evening following the 1st of February; 
               
                  Anne 
                  Clifford 
               



             confessed before Justice Girdler, that 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Brice 
               



             had two guineas and two shillings of the money; Brice was by at the time, and she owned she had it, and said that one 
               
                  John 
                  Cook 
               



             had a guinea for his share, and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Clifford 
               



             confessed she herself had the rest of the money.

            . I heard a man call, for God's sake, watchman, make haste, I am stripped and I shall be murdered, I have lost my watch, I am robbed; the door was open; I found the farmer lying on a bed with some of the clothes over him, without breeches or shoes; I looked about, and found his watch lying on a table by the side of his wig; after that I found 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clifford 
               



            , and the breeches were found and brought to the farmer.

He treated a great many women besides us.

I was not in his company.

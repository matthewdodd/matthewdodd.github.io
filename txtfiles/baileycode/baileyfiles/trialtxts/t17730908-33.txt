            . I am coachman to Mr. Alvarez: I locked up the stable on the 11th of August, about ten at night; I got up next morning and the stable door was broke open, and my room door; this was about a quarter before six in the morning, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; they were found at Mr. Jones's.
Mrs. Jones. The prisoner brought the things to me, and on suspicion I stopped him; he told me he drove for a gentleman who was gone in the country, and he gave them him; I suspected they were not his own; my husband went to Sir

            's, and there we heard who they belonged to; these are the things (producing them). I knew they were not come honestly by, by the price he asked for them; he brought the waistcoat first and I bought it; when he brought the coat it was that I stopped him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought the things in Rosemary-lane and gave them 10 s. for them; I had a man with me, but he is since gone down into the country to work at the harvest.

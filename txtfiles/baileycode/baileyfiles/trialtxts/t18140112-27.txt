                  LUKE
               



            . I am a shoe-maker, I live at 142, Cheapside. I lost these things on the 1st of January. Mr. Jones that keeps a public-house sent for me; he shewed me a basket in the bar, he asked me if I knew any thing of that basket; I said no, I do not know the basket. He asked me again, and then he said I am sure you will know something of the basket if you look in it; on my feeling about the basket I felt there were shoes inside of the basket. I asked Mr. Jones how the basket came there; he told me my servant had brought the basket into his house as soon as he was up; that was 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Housden
               



            , that she brought the basket there, and said she was going away at eleven o'clock, she would call for it again. I opened the top of the basket, I saw there lady's boots and shoes; I saw they were my property. I made up my mind that I would obtain a constable and get him to be at the public-house at the time the girl said she would call for the basket; I got Mr. Shephard, the constable to go to the public-house. About eleven o'clock the prisoner 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Housden
               



             left my house to go with her sister by the coach; they went out together.


                  THOMAS 
                  SMITH
               



            . I am a wholesale hosier and warehouseman. In the basket left at Mr. Jones's I found eleven pair of sandals belonging to me.
MR. SHEPHARD. I am a constable. On the 1st of January, Mr. Luke came to me to go to Mr. Jones's public-house in Gutter-lane, and there I was shewed the basket I now produce. I waited until the servant came for it; in about half an hour 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Housden
               



             came and asked for the basket at the bar; the landlord gave it her. I followed her into Cheapside; I then asked her where she was going with it; she said she was was going to her sister with it. I told her she must go with me to Mr. Luke; she said, there was nothing there of Mr. Luke's; it was her sister's basket. I asked her where her sister was; she turned on the left hand and showed me her sister about three or four doors off. I then took them both into custody. I produce the property; this is the contents of the basket, six pair of boots, a pair of shoes, and eleven pair of sandals.
Mr. Luke. The six pair of lady's boots and the pair of women's shoes are my property.
Mr. Smith. The eleven pair of sandals are my property.
Q. to Mr. Luke. Then Sarah had not lived with you, had she - A. She had been with us about a week; she came up to assist her sister.

            's Defence. My sister knows nothing of it; I leave myself to the mercy of the court.

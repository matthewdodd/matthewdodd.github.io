JOHN CHARLES BRINE
. I keep the Saxe Coburg public-house in the Kent-road. When my attention was drawn to this I missed some pots—there two are mine.





JOSEPH JOHN LEWIS
. I am a Thames police-officer. I saw the prisoner enter a marine-store shop, in Mint-street, Borough, with a bundle—I followed him, and said, "What have you got here?—he pointed to a woman, and said, "This belongs to you"—I said, "That won't do for me; let me see what they are"—I found eight pots, with the bottoms and handles cut off—I took him into custody.





HENRY WHITE VOUSLEY
. I keep the sign of the Tanners, in Long-lane. Two of these are mine.






ROBERRT EAGLE
. I keep the White Bear, Long-walk. Two of these pots are mine—I have lost a great number lately.

Prisoner. I had not taken the pots, nor cut them up—I was coming down by St. George's church, and turned up a gateway—I saw this bundle, and took it up to see what was there—I took them home—my wife told me to take them away—these two officers were standing as if watching me.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported Seven Years.

. On the 14th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came and bought three small quantities of muslim, which came to 11 1/2 d. While they were looking at them I saw Hayes drawing a piece of print under her shawl - she dropped it on the floor, then sat on a chair, picked it up, and put it under her whittle. After they went out of the first door of the shop, I said I wanted to speak to them, she then dropped it from under her whittle. I sent for an officer, and detained them. They came in together. Hayes bought one of the articles which Palmer paid for. They bought each article separately, had them wrapped up, and paid for them separately.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

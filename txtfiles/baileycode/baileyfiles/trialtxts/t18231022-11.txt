            . I am the Enfield errand carrier
. On the 27th of September, my cart stood in Leadenhall-street


 - I stopped at the Bull inn, to deliver a message to the book-keeper. I went about three steps up the gateway, and on returning saw the prisoner standing on the foot-board, taking this box out - it contained the articles stated in the indictment. He jumped off, and ran away with it; I pursued, and stopped him with it in his hand. I had brought it from Enfield to Gracechurch-street.

            . I received him in charge with the box.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A man stood by the cart with a whip in his hand, and his knee, bound up as if lame - he said if I would take that box, and deliver it in Bishopsgate-street he would pay me - this gentleman came and laid hold of me. I was so frightened I had not power to shew him the man.

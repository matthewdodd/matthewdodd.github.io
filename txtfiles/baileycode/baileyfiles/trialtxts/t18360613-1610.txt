REBECCA ANN MACE
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of May, 21 yards of printed cotton, value 10s., the goods of 




John Breakspear, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN WALLINGTON
. I am shopman to Mr. John Breakspear, a linen-draper, in London-street, Greenwich. On Friday, the 20th May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come to the shop-door, but she did not come in—she took the print, put it under her shawl, and walked away with it—I went after her, and asked her where she was going with that piece of print—she said she had purchased it in Holborn—I gave her to the officer—the print has a private mark on it.

Prisoner. He says I had it under my shawl—he took it up in the doorway—I was not off the threshold, when he tapped me on the shoulder. Witness. She was twenty yards from the door, carrying it under her shawl—I did not tell a policeman if he did not take her I would fetch one that would.





JOHN HOILE
. I took the prisoner into custody at the prosecutor's door—she denied having taken the print.





LUKE FEENEY
. I produced the certificate as in the former case.




GUILTY
.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

THOMAS THWAITES. I live in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and am a tailor
. The prisoner has been my errand-boy
 about four years. I did not miss anything, but on Friday last Mr. Philips, a salesman, of Holywell-street, gave me information; the prisoner was not then at home, but on his return I had him taken into custody, and charged him with taking two boys' suits and three great coats, which he had sold to Mr. Philips, and he said it was the first time. I afterwards went and found my property.

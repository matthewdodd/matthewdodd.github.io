            , JUNIOR. My father is a woolen-draper. I paid the prisoner seven pounds two shillings, for an account that we had purchased the Friday before. This is the receipt he have me for it, (read) the receipt is his usual hand-writing.


                  WILLIAM 
                  GEE
               



            . The prisoner was my clerk
. This receipt is his hand writing; he never accounted to me for the money. This is the day-book, in which Mr. Lee is debitted; he ought to have entered it in the cash-book as paid; he has not; he never accompted to me for this seven pounds two shillings.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

EDWARD MARTIN
 and 



CHARLES ALLEN
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
30th of October, 1 umbrella. value 15s., the goods of 



George Turner; and that Allen had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN CURLEY
. I am shopman to George Turner, a silversmith in Long-acre. About eight o'clock on the night of the 30th of October, I was at the door, watching my master's goods—I saw the prisoners come there—Martin took down a silk umbrella which was hanging at the door—Allen was with him at the time—when he had taken it, they walked away together—Martin did not ask the price of it, but put it partly under his coat so as to conceal it—Allen could see what he did—I called my master, and we went after them—I caught Martin, and my master caught Allen, who got away—Martin tried to get from me, but my master assisted me in securing him—this is the umbrella—it is worth 15s.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was Martin standing when he took it? A. By the shop door—it could be reached from outside.





JOHN WILKS
 (police-constable F 149.) I was called, and took Martin into custody—this is the umbrella I received from Mr. Turner.





GEORGE TURNER
. I live in Long-acre. In consequence of an alarm from my boy, I saw the prisoners outside my shop—they were walking armin-arm—I took the umbrella from Allen—he broke from me—I then seized Martin, and brought him back.





CHARLES HENRY BAGNELL
 (police constable F 31.) About eleven o'clock that evening, I took Allen in Drury-lane—I told him I wanted him—he said, "What fort"—I said, "Do you know any thing about an umbrella?"—he made no answer.





EDWARD MABB
 (police-constable F 114.) I produce a certificate of Allen's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he was convicted of stealing a walking-stick from Mr. Turner, the present prosecutor.

             sworn.
I saw a gentleman going on quietly; I watched the two prisoners, who followed him; I am sure they were in company together; I heard them converse together; then the prisoner Bass put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and took out the handkerchief, and gave it to the prisoner Ferrill; as soon as they had done this, they both run away; I told the watchman to take them.
Prisoner. Did not you stop another man, and then let him go? - Yes.

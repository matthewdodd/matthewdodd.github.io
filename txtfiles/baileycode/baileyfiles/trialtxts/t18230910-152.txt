            . I am marshalsman. On the 31st of July, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner and another, (who escaped) in Chapel-street, Grub-street, a quarter of a mile from Fann-street - the prisoner had a handkerchief full of horse-hair in his hand, and in his hat was some of the blue cloth, and some in his pocket. I found a knife on him, the other dropped something, which Mills picked up - he said the other man gave it him to carry.

            .
JAMES DRYWOOD. I am servant
 to Nathaniel Randall, Esq. I lost my great coat from the box of the chariot, on the 19th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock at night; it was in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury


 - I had occasion to get off the box for about three minutes; I heard an alarm, and my coat was gone - it was my own.

            . I was in Museum-street, Bloomsbury, about five minutes walk from where the carriage was; I heard the cry of Stop thief! - I saw the prisoner run and throw down this coat; I picked it up and ran after him - he is the man who dropped it.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. Yes, but not for more than a second, as he turned into Holborn; I was not above ten yards from him.

            . I met the prisoner with the coat; he was walking very deliberately - I heard the cry of Stop thief! - I pursued him, saw him drop the coat, and took him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the prisoner tipsy? A. I should think not, or he could not have run so fast.

            . I have had the coat ever since - the prisoner appeared as if he had had a glass or two.(Property produced and sworn to.)

RICHARD WALLACE. I was in Fleet-street


, opposite Chancery-lane, at half-past seven o'clock on the evening in question, and felt some one at my pocket; I sprang round, and caught the prisoner putting my handkerchief under his jacket - I had been walking with my wife and sister; it has my initials, and No. 3 on it - this is it; there were several persons passing, but none in his company.

            . I saw the prosecutor take the handkerchief from the prisoner's jacket, as he was tucking it up.

            . I am an officer. I produce the handkerchief; Lightfoot, who took it, broke his leg yesterday.

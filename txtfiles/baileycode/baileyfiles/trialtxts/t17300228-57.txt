                                    Christopher

            , the 25th of January
 last.

It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Cellar-Door had been open'd, and Speed was found sitting as if a-sleep in the Ware-house, with the Sugar put up in a Sack, and, as he said, waiting for John Rose to come to him again, who, he pretended had induc'd him to the Commission of the Fact; the Jury found Francis Speed 


               guilty of the Felony
             only; but the Evidence against 
               
                  John 
                  Rose 
               



             not being sufficient, he was 

               acquitted
            .

That the Prisoner pretending she did not think it so late, did hasten the Dinner ; that the Time she went thither was about 12 o' Clock, and that she staid while the Ladies came Home, which was about One. Being ask'd if she saw any Body in the House besides the Prisoner, or heard the Street Door go? She reply'd, she did not hear any thing that should give her Reason to think that any body went out while she was there.

                  John

             was apprehended for a Robbery on the Highway, he went and inquired for her, and having found her, the Prisoner suspecting him, said to him, Dear Neddy, don't betray me, but say I am another Woman: That he thereupon got a Constable, and her Lodgings being search'd, the Petticoat which Madam Brooks claim'd as hers, was found in the Prisoners Lodgings. The Fact being prov'd to the Satisfaction of the Jury, they found the Prisoner 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

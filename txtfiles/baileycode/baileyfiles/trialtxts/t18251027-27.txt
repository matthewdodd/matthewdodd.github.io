            . I was in the service of Mr. G. Forbes, of Sloane-street


. On the morning of the 27th of September, about five minutes after six o'clock, I met the prisoner about fifteen yards from the stable door; I caught hold of him and said "You have got something here which don't belong to you;" he then threw down the coat, the glass, and green baize, and got away from me: I called to the watchman, who stopped him.

            . I am the watchman. I saw the prisoner running from the stable - he dropped the coat, and the coachman called to me - I stopped the prisoner directly, and took him to the watch-house.

            . I am watch-house-keeper. I searched the prisoner there, and found a crow bar on him.

            . I am an officer. I found this crow-bar in his coat pocket; I compared it with the marks on the door of the stable - it appeared to fit exactly.

            . On the 9th of last Month I was going up Whitechapel with 2 other Men, and a Person tapped me on the Shoulder, and informed me that my Pocket was picked, and that the Man was gone up Petticoat Lane. I desired the Person to pursue him, and in a few Minutes the Prisoner was brought to me, with my Handkerchief on his Head, under his Hat. I took him to a Tavern from whence I carried him before 
               
                  Mr.
                   Alderman Westley
               



             at Guild Hall, where he owned that he took the Handkerchief out of my Pocket.

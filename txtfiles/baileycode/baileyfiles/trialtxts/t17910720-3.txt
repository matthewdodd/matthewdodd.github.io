             sworn.
I am an apprentice
. I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment, in Fenchurch-street


; I was going home with this bundle; it was in my hand; I am fifteen years old: my father finds me in clothes. The prisoner stopped me, and asked me if my name was not Dickinson? I told him yes; he asked me if I was not apprentice to Mr. Allen? I told him yes; he told me he had just come from my master; he told me my master had described me to him; he said there was a gentleman at my master's, just come out of the country, whose name was George; I was to go back to the White Hart Inn in the Borough, and there was a pair of large saddle bags; I was to bring them; he said there was a good load; he was going back to my master's, and he would carry back the bundle; I delivered the bundle to him; there was no saddle bags at the White Hart; I have never seen the things since; the prisoner was taken next morning; I saw him; he is the man who took the bundle.
Prisoner. Are you sure I am the man? - Yes.

             sworn.
I am the father of the last witness. I know nothing of the matter, but what the boy told me; he was taking the bundle from before nine o'clock on Saturday, the 8th of June; it was clean linen; he returned about ten the same evening, without the property; I asked him if he should know the man who robbed him? he said yes; he gave a very minute description of the man; and I immediately suspected him, as I had known him before; I asked him how he could do such a thing; he said he was not the man; I then apprehended him.

            . I had seen him two or three times at my father's before the robbery.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
It is very odd; I have been at his father's house four months; I was at Bow-fair from five till eleven at night.

                   Dickinson
               



            . It was ten minutes past nine o'clock, at the corner of Fenchurch-street, I was robbed; as I was coming up Fish-street-hill, I turned round and looked at the clock. I was going from my father's house to my master's, in Somerset-street, Whitechapel.

(For the prisoner.)

             sworn.
I am a bricklayer's labourer. From eight o'clock, till half past ten, I was with the prisoner at Bow-fair; I never left him during the time; we were in a public house; I believe it is the King's Arms; the first house on the left hand; the front room; there were many other people there; I drank along with that gentleman at the bar; and nobody else; I met him in the same house; I know but little of him, only being a neighbour; I live in Gravel-lane; it was of a Saturday, in Whitsun week; I cannot tell what day of the month; I was there on Saturday, and no other day. That gentleman's father found me, and summoned me up; his father is a carpenter; I lived near St. Thomas's Hospital; I have changed my habitation lately; I do not know the prisoner's occupation.
The prisoner called another witness to his character.

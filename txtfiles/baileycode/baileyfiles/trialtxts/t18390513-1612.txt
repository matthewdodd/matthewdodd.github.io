ABRAHAM GEORGE ROW
. I am servant to Robert Richardson, a shoemaker, in Shoreditch. On the 3rd of May the prisoner came in with another woman to purchase a pair of shoes for the other woman, and wished to pay for them by instalments—I went to the back-part of the shop to inquire of our young man about it, and while I was gone these shoes were taken—I gave them an answer, and they went out—the boy gave me information—I followed the prisoner, and overtook her, in White Lion-street—she dropped the shoes about three yards before I came to her—I gave her in charge—they are men's shoes—she had parted from the other woman at the end of White Lion-street.





GEORGE HAMMOND
. I work in the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner take the shoes, and put them under her shawl—when she was gone out I told Row.

Prisoner's Defence. The other woman took them, and gave them to me when she came out.





MAURICE MOLLOY
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—she is the person who was tried.

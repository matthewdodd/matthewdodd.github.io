            . On Wednesday the 6th of July, in the morning about five o'clock, having a suspicion of Tyers, Thornton, and Swanwick, of stealing coals from my master, I watch'd them, and saw them come into a barge, and fill a sack with coals, which Tyers carried and pitch'd on a bench, a place we have on purpose to put them off upon carts. 
               
                  George 
                  Swanwick 
               



             carried another out of the yard, I pursu'd him, but looking back to see if any of the others saw me, I saw Thornton bring up another sack, I pursu'd Swanwick to the prisoner 
               
                  John 
                  Low 
               



            's house, and being there before Thornton I hid myself in a gateway in Doctor's Commons, and saw him carry his sack into Low's house. Then I went home and call'd my master, and got a constable, and they were all taken up. Then we went to 
               
                  John 
                  Low 
               



            's house, and I told him what I had seen; he bid me look any where for the sacks, denying having received any coals. I look'd upon the coal heap, and there were coals newly shot. I said these are the coals that the men brought, and he did not say any thing to the contrary.
Q. How long was this after you saw the men carry coals there?
Bottomly. It was about three hours after. Coals that have been shot some time will look dry, these were very fresh, and they were of that particular sort that we had lost. I said I could very safely make my affidavit to them; his answer was, he knew nothing of it, he was not up at the time. The sacks were the property of 
               
                  John 
                  Klockenbrink 
               



            .
Tyers's Defence.
We had some coals that we had kept for a week or better, which we had swept up on the wharf. I put them into a sack, and we went into the lighter to take a few more, and Mr. Low was so kind as to tell us if we had a handful of sweepings he would give us a pot or two of beer for them, so we took the liberty of taking a shovelful more.
Bottomly. I saw these men carry one sack empty into the barge, and fill it with coals there.
Low's Defence.
I know nothing of it.
For Swanwick.

            . I took up Tyers and the two others that were tried with him.
Q. What is your business?
Klockenbrink. I am in the coal trade. This Curtice, an evidence here, being extremely affrighted when I took up the other three, went into the counting house, and confessed he had a hand in carrying a sack of malt to 
               
                  William

            's house, in Cloth-Fair. All I know of my own knowledge is, I lost four sacks of malt, four bushels in a sack, the property of Mr. 
               
                  George 
                  Nelson

                  Curtice 
               



            . I work'd for the prosecutor; on Saturday night the 21st of May, Tyers bid me come early on Monday the 23d I went early down into the yard accordingly, and Tyers followed me with an empty sack. He went into the warehouse and call'd me to him, then we took a sack of malt and put it into an empty sack, sack and all. Then he ask'd me if I knew Cloth-Fair, I said no, then he said, do you know Paul's Wharf Hill, he bid me go up there, and make the best of my way up Duck-lane with it. I went, and when I came there with the sack of malt he stood leaning upon a post, at the corner of Smithfield. I ask'd him how much farther I was to carry it, he said but a little way, then he had me into Cloth Fair, to the house of Low the prisoner, a publick house, the White Hart; we went thro' the tap room, and up one pair of stairs, and pitched the malt in a passage, where I saw a malt mill fix'd against the wall; then we went both of us down stairs, and in a few minutes the prisoner Low came down stairs, and paid Tyers for the malt, but he said nothing to me; after this Tyers and he went backwards together.
Q. Do you know whether Low knew the malt was in his house.
Curtice. No, I do not.
Q. What consideration had you for carrying this malt?
Curtice. Tyers gave me either 3 s. and 8 d. or 4 s. and 2 d. I don't know which.
Q. Had you any liquor?
Curtice. We had two pots of two-penny.
Q. Did Low know what Tyers gave you?
Curtice. No, not as I know of; I know Tyers and Low were particular acquaintance.

Low 

               Acquited

            . I found my box broke open. The prisoner lodged in my house; he was to go abroad in the East India service. The next day I found the prisoner at Justice Welch's with a waistcoat and pair of breeches of mine upon him. We found a marline spike in his pocket; he acknowledged that he had broke open my box, and taken out the things mentioned in the indictment.

            . I lodge in Mr. Webb's house. Mrs. Daries being alarmed that she was robbed, we went in pursuit of the prisoner. We found him near the Seven Dials; he had a pair of breeches and a waistcoat on, which Mr. Webb afterwards owned to be his.

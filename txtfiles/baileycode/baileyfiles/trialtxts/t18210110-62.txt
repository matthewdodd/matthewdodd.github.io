            . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol. I was in Providence-row on Monday, and met the prisoner with the chest of tea on his shoulder. I suspected and asked where he was going with it - he was close to Mr. Laws, a grocer - he said he was going in there - he turned as if to go in, and threw it down on the first step. I secured him.

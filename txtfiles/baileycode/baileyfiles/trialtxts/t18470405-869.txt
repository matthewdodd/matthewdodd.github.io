GEORGE SCOTT
 (City police-constable, No.  560.) On the 24th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty at London-bridgewharf, and saw the prisoner in company with another person—I watched them—I saw the prisoner attempt' to pick several pockets—at last I saw him draw a handkerchief from Mr. Harris's pocket—he ran away—I overtook him—when I was just coming up to him he threw the handkerchief away—I did not see the handkerchief picked up—Mr. Harris gave it me afterwards.

Prisoner. I was not in company; I was by myself. Witness. You were with a person who has since been committed for three months by the Magistrate.





JAMES HARRIS.
 I live at Merchant Taylor's Hall, Threadneedle-street, and am butler to the Company. On the 24th of March Scott spoke to me, and I missed my handkerchief—I saw Scott run after the prisoner—I followed, and saw the prisoner before Scott—about three yards before I got up to the prisoner I picked up the handkerchief—it had been removed forty or fifty yards—this is it—it is my property—it has my initials on it.




GUILTY.** Aged 18.—

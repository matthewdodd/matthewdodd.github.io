               feloniously receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen
            .
MR. BODKIN conducted the prosecution.
THOMAS NEWSOM. I am a gardener
, and live at Tottenham - I had a shop there in February last, but neither I nor any of my family slept there. On the night of the 26th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I left the articles stated all safe in the shop; there is a door leads from the shop to the stairs of the dwelling-house - I fastened the shop; I went next morning between five and six o'clock - I unlocked the door of the shop, but could not get in; a man going by with a light came and assisted me: we pushed the door open and found the obstruction was occasioned by a sack being hung over the fan-light over the door - I missed all the articles stated, and the copper money and foreign coin from a desk; I went to the back door and found it on the latch - I had bolted it the night before; I looked up and saw a back room window open, and marks on the tiles as if men had got in there; I am not sure whether it had been shut the night before - the door leading to the stairs was open; which I had shut and latched - I saw several footsteps, and traced one across the gate-way, and across the field to a stile leading to Scotland-green, and on to the pavement, where I lost them; this was between six and seven o'clock; there were two or three persons footsteps at the back of my house, but it was only one I traced so far.


                  WILLIAM 
                  TALBOT
               



            . I am a farmer, and live at Tottenham. On the morning of the 27th of February I was out early in my field, which is between the prosecutor's and the house in which Wallis lives - I went up a private lane, and found the fence broken down; I then found some person had been crossing there - as I was returning I saw Griffiths and the other constable tracing some footsteps across my field; I came down to where the fence was broken, and found some footsteps, which I traced over another fence into Mr. Newsom's garden; I saw 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Wallis
               



            , who was between Mr. Newsom's and his own house - he appeared to be raking.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see the rake? A. I cannot say I did; I did not speak to him - I was thirty or forty yards from him; I did not ask what business he had there - this was about seven o'clock; I told the officer.


                  JAMES 
                  GRIFFITHS
               



            . I am constable of Tottenham. On the morning after this robbery, I went with Fowler to the prosecutor's about seven o'clock - I found footsteps of two persons as it appeared to me; they went from there to within thirty or forty yards of Wallis' house - I got a warrant and went to Wallis'; I saw 
               
                  Martha 
                  Wallis
               



             first, and then Jane Wallis, the mother - I said I had a warrant to search for stolen property; she said "For God's sake, Mr. Griffiths, do'nt make any uproar in the parish - I will let you know where they all are;" the daughter then said to her, "I will tell you what mother, the first time I knew my brother kept company with 
               
                  Bill 
                  Piper
               



            , I knew there never would be any good come of it" - the mother then went up stairs; I and the daughter followed; I saw something which appeared to be a bed, but it was not - she took off the top clothes, and under them was the whole of the property; the prosecutor was with me and claimed it - I took 
               
                  William 
                  Wallis
               



             and Piper the same day; I found on Wallis, 2s. 1 1/2d. in copper, and among it this coin: there was only a knife on Piper - I took them past the prosecutor's house- Mrs. Newsom stood at the door, and said, "You good for nothing rogues, how could you rob such poor people as us?" Piper said, "D - n your eyes, why did not you take your pig home with you;" I knew old Wallis had left home, and I took him in Herts - I know Mr. Robinson's hand-writing; this examination is signed by him.
Cross-examined. Q. Is Mrs. Newsom here? A. No. I went over the ground and saw the marks of two persons who had gone in different tracks the same way; I heard Mr. Newsom state that the marks were traced to within one hundred yards of Wallis, but I traced them in a different way and nearer the house - 
               
                  Jane 
                  Wallis
               



             told me she would give up all, and if she had known they had been Mr. Newsom's she would have taken them back.


                  JOHN 
                  FOWLER
               



            . I am a constable. I searched Piper'shouse, and found a pair of gaiters and stockings very wet, as if they had been lately used, and this chisel, which I applied to the marks on the desk at the prosecutor's, and they corresponded exactly.


                  THOMAS 
                  NEWSOM
               



            . This coin was in the desk at my house, and the property found at Wallis' was mine.
Cross-examined. Q. Where was this coin? A. By itself in the desk, where the copper monies were; I saw it safe the night before.
The examinations were here put in and read.
William Piper, being asked by me if he had any thing to say, cautioning him, that what he said would be put down in writing, and used in evidence; neither promise nor threat was made or held out to him, but he voluntarily saith, "I went with Wallis last night to Islington, and we returned together about twelve o'clock at night; we went to my father-in-law's, in Benson's-yard, Tottenham - we staid there about ten minutes; we parted at my father-in-law's - I went directly home to my lodgings, and went to bed about one o'clock; I know nothing about the articles now produced." The mark of X WM. PIPER.

            , the son, being asked by me if he had any thing to say, cautioning him, that what he said would be put down in writing, and used in evidence (neither threat nor promise was made or held out to him), but he voluntarily says -"Yesterday evening, after work, I went to Islington with William Piper; we returned to Tottenham about half-past twelve o'clock at night - we went together to Piper's mother-in-law's house, in Benson's-yard; Piper went home to his lodgings, and I went home to my father - about a quarter to one o'clock I had occasion to go into the yard; I found all the articles now produced, tied up in two sacks behind the privy - I took them into the house, and put them in the room below stairs; I opened the sacks, and I saw in one of them a dead pig, "which I took out and laid it on the table - I then went to bed; in the morning, when I got up, I told my father what I had found behind the privy." The mark X of W. WALLIS.
Before me, W. ROBINSON, 27th February, 1830.

. This blanket was in my shop. On Sunday, the 30th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I heard a noise, and found my private door open, and the prisoner with one foot on the step. Another door must be opened to get at it. I asked what he wanted. He muttered something. He had something in his hand, which I thought was a great coat. I went into the parlour for a light, and in returning to the door, saw him running down the street. I ran round another way, and met him running into his own house, in George-street, with the blanket in his hand. I seized him, and he threw it down, and gave him in charge; returned, and missed the blanket. It was safe on Saturday night. The prisoner pretended to be very drunk, but ran very well.

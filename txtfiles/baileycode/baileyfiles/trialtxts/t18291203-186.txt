            . I am a horse-keeper
. I hired the prisoner by the day to assist me - he had been but two or three days with me, and left on the 14th of November, without notice; when he was gone I missed a pair of shoes from the manger - I found him on the Thursday after at Mr. Stacey's, and asked if he knew any thing about them- he said No, and he did not know that I wanted him any more; I found my shoes at the pawnbroker's.
JAMES KING. I am a pawnbroker. These shoes were pawned by the prisoner on the 16th of November.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a person about half-past seven o'clock on the Saturday night, who asked me if I wanted to buy a pair of shoes; I said Yes, and gave him 1s. 6d. - I wore them on Sunday; they were rather too short, and I pawned them.

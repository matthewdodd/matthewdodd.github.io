            . I am a tailor
, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. The prisoner was in my service; I missed four steel clasps from my closet; they were safe on Thursday the 10th of July, between eight and ten o'clock. I missed them on the Saturday following, and have not found them, he had absconded. I met him on Sunday morning, on Saffron-hill, he trembled when he saw me; I said I wanted him to go with me. I charged him with stealing the clasps, as nobody but him could have done it, and insisted on his telling the truth. I neither threatened norpromised him - he said he had sold them to Mr. Lyon, of High-street, St. Giles's, for 5 s. I went there with him; Lyon denied ever seeing him.

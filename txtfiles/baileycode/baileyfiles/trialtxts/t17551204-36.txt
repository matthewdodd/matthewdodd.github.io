            ; the prisoner lodged in my house a fortnight, and it is six weeks ago since she went away. I missed 2 silver table spoons, last Monday was a month, from out of a glass case. I took the prisoner up, and charged her on suspicion, having no other person in the room. She used to lie with my mother. At first she denied it, but at last she owned the taking them, and said they were both in pawn in Oxford-Road, at two separate houses. Justice Fielding ordered the constable to go with her, and bring the pawnbrokers before him. We went, and took the prisoner with us; and found one spoon at Mr. Hudson's, the other at Mr. Jones's.

            . (Produced a silver spoon. ) The prisoner at the bar brought this spoon and pledged it with me the day after old Michaelmas day. She said it was her own spoon, and I lent her 6 s. upon it.

            . The prisoner brought this other silver spoon to me the 18th of October; I lent her 6 s. upon it.
Q. to Prosecutrix. Look upon these spoons; do you know them?
Prosecutrix. They are my property.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

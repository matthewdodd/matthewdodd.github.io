About a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, with a boy about sixteen years old, following Johnson, about five yards - I then saw the prisoner put his hand to the pocket - a great mob stood by the wine-vaults; I there saw him take the handkerchief from the pocket, and throw it behind; the other ran off. I picked it up, and secured the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)

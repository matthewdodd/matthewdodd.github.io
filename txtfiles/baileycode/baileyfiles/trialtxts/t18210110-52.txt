, and live in Monmouth-street



. On the 20th of December, the prisoner came to pawn a handkerchief for 6 d. She snatched a pair of stays from the door as she went out, and tried to get a lot of table-cloths down, but only tore them. I did not miss the stays till she was detained with them at the next pawnbroker's, and brought to me.

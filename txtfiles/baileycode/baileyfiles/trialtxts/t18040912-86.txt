Q. How much did they contain? - A. One was twenty-eight yards and a half, and the other was twenty-four; he asked me to be particular to find two pieces of this colour, for the ladies were waiting to choose them.

Q. Does Mr. Godwin know better than you - whether Mr. Godwin is their agent? - A Yes, he is.
Q. You only acted because he was out? - A. No.

            , that house is in Russell-place


, it is an unfinished house; the prisoner Casey was brought to me to the front of the house, without any lead, it having been seized, I missed about half an hundred of lead; and about two yards of pipe, and a sesspool of lead; half an hundred was quite taken away, that was from the flat roof, two yards of pipe were fastened to the wall, the prisoner Ball was taken out of the next house, one small piece of lead was laying on the flat, it was cut away, and some more was found in the back area, the pipe was not found at all, it was taken entirely away, and so was the sesspool head; I was not present when the prisoner was taken.

             sworn.
I am a plaisterer; I was at the taking of this prisoner; as I came through London-street, between eight and nine on the 24th of February, as we came past this house, we heard a dog bark; it was rather darkish; then I asked where Mrs. Gowing lived, while we were consulting, the prisoner Casey came by from the field which adjoins this wall; which was the other side where this flat was, he looked at us very hard; I am sure he did not come from the house, he came from the outside, from a kind of bottom; as soon as he was gone out of sight, I told Jones to knock at the door, the servant came and asked us what we wanted; I told him, I believed they were thieves, he went and found Casey in the same place where he came from, Mr. Cunningham jumped down, and asked him what he wanted there, I looked down and found this hair cloth close to the place where we took him; I went to fetch a candle and lanthorn, it is about one hundred and fifty yards off the place, we examined the whole house, and found one of the pieces of lead on the inside of the house, and the least piece on the table; before that we saw a man laying on the coping, on the flat on his face; I do not know who that man was, Mr. Cunningham spoke directly to lend him a gun to shoot him; in one of the vaults in the front area, in the next house, we found Ball laying double, as if he was asleep, we asked him what he wanted there, he said he had been drinking with some of his shop mates, and had tumbled down the area, and fell fast asleep, we took them both to the public house; and left them to the care of the watchman.

             sworn.
On the 24th of February, between eight and nine, I was at the prosecutor's house, and this Edmunds and Jones came there, and said, there were two men stealing the lead off the flat in London-street, Mr. Gowing and me went with them, Mr. Gowing, and Jones stood at the front of the house, whileEdmunds and me went to the back part of it, when we came to the corner, we just saw a man at the foot of the wall, we immediately rushed down upon him, and he stopped down, I caught him by the collar, and brought him out; I saw the other prisoner Ball lay on the coping of the wall; I did not move him then, but he dropped inside; and I went and took him; there was no other to be found in the house, we called him several times to come down, and he would not stir, then I said, go, fetch a gun, and we will soon bring him down; the wall is 16 feet high, but there is a leaded flat about the middle of it; after we took the prisoners, we all went and examined the lead; the lead was all gone but these two pipes, this pipe was on the flat; it has been measured, and it corresponded, I saw it tried.
Court to Gowing. I suppose you cannot swear to the lead particularly? - No more than by its sitting the place.
PRISONER CASEY's DEFENCE.
I was a porter in Covent Garden, and a young man gave me a shilling to carry a trunk from the Green Man to the Adam and Eve; I staid an hour, and so he gave me some drink; and I wandered about, and came past this house; and I sat down; and this man came directly and found me.
PRISONER BALL's DEFENCE.
I met with some of my shop mates, who came with Admiral Hood from the West Indies, I went a drinking with them all the whole day in the afternoon; I got rather too much liquor; I tumbled down in the area; and there I lay when these people found me; it was day light when I tumbled down there.

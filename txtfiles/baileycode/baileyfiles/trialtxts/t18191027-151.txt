            . On the 26th of October, about a quarter after five o'clock in the afternoon, as I stood at the door, I saw the prisoner look at the warming-pan, which hung at the door post - he took it down deliberately, and walked away with it. I was looking at him, but as several things hung at the door. I went out to see what he had taken. I told the young man he had taken something - we went after him, and he was brought back. I saw him put the warming-pan down.

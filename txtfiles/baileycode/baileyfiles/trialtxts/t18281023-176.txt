FRANCES GILHAM. I am a widow, and live in Elbow-lane, New Gravel-lane, Shadwell


. I let a first-floor room, furnished, to the prisoner; she was with me about a fortnight - I gave her notice to quit: I went into her room and missed a sheet - she denied it at first, and then said she had pawned it, and would redeem it next morning - I had never permitted her to pawn any of my property.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Ratcliff-highway. I took in this sheet of the prisoner, on the 1st of October, in the name of Mary Smith.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. If I had done it with an intention of wronging her, should I not have taken something of more value? I was distressed for a trifle of money - I told her I should take it out the next morning, and she was satisfied.

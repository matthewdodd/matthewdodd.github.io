On the 23d of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went out from No. 9, in Allhallow's Lane, where I live, I returned about one, I found a heap of copper cakes, and other pieces like this disturbed; I am clerk to the prosecutors, and live over the warehouse; I was informed two people had been taken; I can't rightly swear to the copper.

             sworn.
About twelve o'clock, on the 31st of March, I saw the prisoners in Allhallow's Lane, they were about the door of Homerand Rabey; I suspected them; I went and hid myself in the warehouse; I had not been there above two minutes before Wilson came in, and the other went to the door; Wilson went to the right hand, and laid hold of a piece of copper, which he did not take away, but went back again; then Stevens, he came in, and he went back again; I went out, and I walked to the top of the lane; I kept my eye on them, and came back, and went into a cooper's shop, then I observed Stevens at the door, and Wilson came out loaded; he stooped down to buckle his shoes, and I went and laid hold of him, Stevens then came up, and Wilson dropt the copper, and then I laid hold of both the prisoners.
Court. Did you see Wilson come out of the warehouse with the copper? - I did.

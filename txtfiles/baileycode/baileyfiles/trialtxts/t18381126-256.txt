THOMAS BRYANT
. I am in the employ of Mr. Sherwood on the railI went into a shop in Southwark to buy some muffins, and put down a crown-piece—the man had no change—the prisoner followed me in, and wanted me to give her a muffin—she snatched up the five shilling piece, and said she would go and get change—I ran after her, and caught her—I asked her to give it me—she would not—I held her till the people came up.

Prisoner. Did you not drag me into the shop, and say you would give me a muffin? Witness. No.





HENRY SMITH
. I am an apprentice to John Green, in Kent-street, a shoemaker. I saw the prosecutor go into the muffin shop in King-street—he put the money down on the counter—she took it up and ran out—the man said, "You go after it, or you will lose it"—he did, and she said she would not give it him.—he went to get a policeman—I and another young man watched the prisoner, and she went up some stairs—the money has not been found.


Prisoner. The prosecutor said he had been robbed by two girls before he met me, and then he asked me where they were—I did not rob him.

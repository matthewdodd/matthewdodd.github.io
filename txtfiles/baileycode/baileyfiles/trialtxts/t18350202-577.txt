PATRICK M'CORMACK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of January, 1 pewter pot, value 1s. 8d., the goods of 



William Dew, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE YOUNG
. I am pot-boy to William Dew, at the corner of Gray-street,

James-street, Mary-le-bone—about half-past seven o'clock on Monday, the 19th of January, I saw the prisoner in the tap-room, sitting drinking, and I saw by a bulk in his hat that he had something—I told my master—the prisoner then went out of the house—I followed him into the house of Mr. Leary, in Gee's-court, which is about two minutes' walk from my master's—I called him out, and asked what he had got in his hat—he said he would not tell me without I would be on my oath not to tell any thing about it—I said I would—he had this pot—I then went home, and the prisoner followed me—I told my master, and he sent for an officer, who took him.





WILLIAM BROWNE
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner—he said he was going to take the pot to another house to take a pot of beer home, as he could get it a penny cheaper by taking the pot.





WILLIAM DEW
. This pot is mine—the prisoner has been in the habit of using my house.





JAMES CLAPSON
. I produce a certificate or the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I know he is the same person—(read.)

Prisoner's Defence. The pot-boy had an umbrage against me for complaining to his mistress that he was saucy to a man, and he said he would do me an injury—I took the pot out to give some beer to a man—I was bringing it back, when he met me—I was going to get a pot of beer at another house for threepence.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.
There was another indictment against the prisoner.

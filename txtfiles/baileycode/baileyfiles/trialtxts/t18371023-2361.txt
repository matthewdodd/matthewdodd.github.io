JAMES PLUMMER
. I am brewer to Messrs. Goding, of the Belvidere-road. About one o'clock in the day, on the 23rd of October, I was on Westminster-bridge—my friend called my attention—I turned and my handkerchief was gone—a man was running—my friend had got the prisoner, and said, "I have got the one that took it, you go and take the we that has got it," but that man escaped.





JOHN SAXBY JARVIS
. I was walking with the prosecutor and observed the prisoner pick his pocket—I secured him—I saw him give the handkerchief to another boy—I told my friend to run after the boy, but he could not catch him.

Prisoner. I am quite innocent.

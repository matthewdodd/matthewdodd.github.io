            . I am a Police-officer. On the 12th of September I was in Pall-mall


, about four o'clock in theafternoon, I saw the prisoner attempt several gentlemen's pockets, and at last I saw him draw this handkerchief; with his left-hand from a gentleman's right-hand pocket, and put it into his left-hand trousers pocket - I spoke to the gentleman, and asked if he had lost his handkerchief - he said he had; I told him to follow me - I took the prisoner out of the crowd, but lost the gentleman.
Prisoner's Defence. I was at the water side till halfpast six o'clock, when a waterman landed two gentlemen and a lady; he made the boat fast - I went into it, and under the seat I found this handkerchief; on the day I was taken I got into a crowd - thinking I should have my hat knocked off, I took my handkerchief out of it, and put it into my pocket; the officer came and took me.

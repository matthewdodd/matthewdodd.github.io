WILLIAM ATKINSON
. I live in Lloyd-square, Clerkenwell, and am an engineer. On 6th April, I was in front of a shop in Gray's-inn-lane—I felt some one against my pocket—I went on a step or two, and then felt something again—I turned round and saw the prisoner passing from me—I missed my handkerchief—the prisoner ran, and I called, "Stop thief!"—he dropped this handkerchief and was stopped by a gentleman—I went up, took him by the collar, and gave him in charge—he said he had picked the handkerchief up—it is mine (looking at it).





WILLIAM TODMAN
 (policeman, G 125). I took the prisoner, and produce the handkerchief.





JOHN RANDALL
 (police-sergeant, E 26). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Sept., 1848, having been before convicted, and confined one year)—he is the person.

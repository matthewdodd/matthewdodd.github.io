WILLIAM STRATFORD
 was indicted

for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



James Upjohn and another, on the 
9th of April, at 
Hanwell, and stealing therein, 1 watch, value 4l. 10s., their property.






WILLIAM BRAMLEY
. I am an apprentice to James Upjohn and another, watchmakers at Brentford. I was in the shop on the night of the 9th of April, and heard a window break—I looked up, and saw a hand in through the broken pane, among the watches—I immediately got over the counter, ran out, and caught the prisoner about twelve yards from the window—I asked him if he had broken the window—he said, "Yes"—I brought him back to the shop, and he delivered up the watch—it is worth 4l. 10s.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe he was standing still when you took him? A. He was running from the window, and I believe he was walking on when I stopped him—he afterwards said he must admit he had done it, for he wanted to be transported.





EDWARD SCOTCHMER
 (police-constable T 27.) The prisoner was given into my custody in the prosecutor's shop—he said he had committed the robbery on purpose to be taken up, for he wished to be transported—I noticed a stone inside the shop window among the watches—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of Hanwell.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY. * Aged 19.—Recommended to mercy





Transported for Ten Years.—Penitentiary.

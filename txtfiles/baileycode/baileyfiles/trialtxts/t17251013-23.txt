It appeared that the Prosecutors being all Chimney-Sweeper


s, had been at Work in Wapping


, and had left their Soot in an old Woman's Yard, from whence, at Night, the Prisoner stole it, and carry'd it off by Water; but being suspected, he was examin'd, confess'd he took it, and discover'd where he had concealed it.

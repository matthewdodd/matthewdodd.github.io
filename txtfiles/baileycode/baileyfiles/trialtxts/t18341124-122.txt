HENRY HUMPHREYS
. I live in South-street, Spitalfields. On the 17th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Whitechapel—some one tapped me on the shoulder, and then I missed my handkerchief from my pocket—I had it safe ten minutes before—it has not been found—I followed the prisoner, who was said to have taken it, to Petticoat-lane—I could not find any officer, and left him there—he saw me following him, and said, if I came any further he would rob me of something else—

I had accused him of taking my handkerchief, and he denied it—he had a companion with him, and I concluded he had passed it to him.





WALTER WILSON
. I live with my father, No. 2, Duke-street. He is a boot and shoemaker. I was in Whitechapel that evening—I saw the prosecutor walking with another gentleman, and the prisoner took a handkerchief out of his coat pocket—I told the prosecutor of it—the prisoner gave the handkerchief to another young man, and he went off—I am quite sure the prisoner took it.

Prisoner. Being placed in this perilous situation, I beg to leave my case to your merciful and humane consideration.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

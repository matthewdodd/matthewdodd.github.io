PHILIP BROCK. I am an optical instrument-maker
, and live in Church-row, Aldgate


. On the 28th of September I was at work at the window-the articles stated in the indictment were in a case behind me. The prisoner came in to buy a glass for a show. I said I had nobody to serve him, he said he would call in half an hour-he went round on my left hand, and went out. In about five minutes I missed the microscope and case. I informed the officer. I am certain the prisoner is the boy who came into the shop. The microscope was safe when he came in, and nobody came in after till I missed it.

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor described the prisoner to me. I met him, collared him, and said he must go with me. I took him to the prosecutor, he said he was the boy - He denied it. I sent for his father. He then said he sold it to one Isaacs for 5s. - Isaacs denied it. At last he promised to send it back in five minutes, but he did not.

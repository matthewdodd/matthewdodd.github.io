            . I am in the employ of Messrs. George Drake Sewel, and Thomas Cross, linen-drapers

, Frith-street, Soho


. On the 13th December, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the print on the counter; the prisoner came in; she said she wanted some black stuff - I showed her some on the same counter, where the printed cotton was; she was within reach of it, she bought a yard and a-half of black stuff, for 1 s. 6 d. - there were several other persons serving in the shop - I missed the print before she left the shop - I informed one of our young men, at the top of the shop - he came down, and asked her if she had any thing which did not belong to her; she denied it; he then asked her to walk to the end of the shop - I walked after her, and saw the cotton fall from under her clothes; it was twenty yards, and worth about a guinea - she said she did not know how it got there; it was not possible it could have dropped, in the way it did, unless she had taken it.

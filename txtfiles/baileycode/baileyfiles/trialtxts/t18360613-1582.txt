DANIEL PUGSLEY
. I am in the service of Mr. Moses Agar, hosier, of Fenchurch-street. On the 15th of June, the Prisoner Collins, came close up to me in the shop, and asked if I knew a person of the name of Bray, a stationer—I said, "No"—he turned to go out—I watched him, and then I missed a piece of silk-handkerchief from a block in the shop—I followed him to the corner of the next street, where he met the other prisoner, and spoke to him—they saw me, and ran off—I pursued them, and they were both taken in Philpot-lane—they made a great deal of resistance but were secured—these are my master's handkerchiefs.

Collins. Q. Did I not walk into the shop, and ask you Mr. Bray, a pocket-book-maker? A. You came up to me at the back of the shop; and I was surprised to see you, as I had not heard you come in—I did not see you take any thing.





JOHN DRAPER
. I was passing, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—Fountain was first—I pursued and seized him—when I caught him, I turned round to see for the prisoner, and

then these handkerchiefs laid at my feet—I have no doubt Fountain dropped them, but I did not see it.





THOMAS GIBSON
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief" and ran—when I got up, these silk handkerchief were half in Fountain's hat and half out—Fountain said, "Give me my hat"—I took up the hat, and the officer look the handkerchiefs.

Fountain's Defence. My hat was twenty yards from where they picked the silk up. Witness. No, the silk was partly in it.

I came up to Mr. Graham's assistance, he had hold of the prisoner, the prisoner was carried to the watch-house, afterwards it occurred to me, that possibly some weapon might be found, I went back to the place where Mr. Graham had the prisoner down, there I found an old pistol without a lock.

I did not know why Mr. Graham seized me, the coach was stopped by two other persons, that threw something at my head, and struck me, I know nothing of it.
He called two witnesses, who both gave him a good character.

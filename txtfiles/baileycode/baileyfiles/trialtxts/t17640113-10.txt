            . I think it was the 4th of this Instant, I had a gentleman dined with me in the city, and going with him to the Temple-Exchange Coffee-house, I saw the prisoner standing looking on a show-glass; he walked on, and we came to the lottery-office, under St. Dunstan's church


, there was a very great light. I turned about, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief half out of my pocket; he took it out, and past by me. I took hold of his collar, at Clifford's-Inn coffee-house, and said, you have pick'd my pocket: he said, I pick'd your pocket, Sir! I give you leave to search me: I have none of your handkerchief. I had not then mentioned the word handkerchief, I only said he had picked my pocket; this was about six in the evening. I took him into the coffee house, and sent for a constable, Mr. Webster, who was with me, said, if you can bring any substantial tradesman that can give you a character, you shall be at liberty. He said, there was somebody that knew him, on the other side Temple-bar; after that, he said the persons lived in Old-street. I told him, if he could bring any body next morning, he should then be at liberty, but nobody came; I never saw my handkerchief after. My friend said he saw two other dirty people near him, but I did not. I know I had it in my pocket when I was near Fetter-lane.
Prisoner's Defence.
This is the handkerchief I had in my hand: (producing a blue and white linnen handkerchief) he asked me what I had done with his handkerchief? I said, if he thought I had dropt it, go back and see; but he took me into the coffee-house.

            . I keep a coal and potatoe warehouse
 in Tower-street


. On the 27th of November I employed the prisoner at my house - He dined with me and my wife; when we were at dinner I put my purse on the table, and told my wife to put it away, but she did not-there was 12l. in it; next day I missed two 1l. notes out of it, and went to look for the prisoner. I found him at St. Andrew's-street, he took a 1l. note out of his pocket and gave it to me; it was one of the notes that I had lost out of my purse.

MARY SULLIVAN. I am the wife of James Sullivan; the articles mentioned in the indictment were in the box, except the four gowns, which hung on a line, to the same room with the box. The prisoner is quite a stranger to me. The prisoner and another man opened my door, while I was in the back-room, and took the things away. The other manh ran away, and I shut the door, and shut the prisoner in. The box, which contained the things, was under his arm. He was secured.

JEREMIAH GRAHAM
 was indicted

for stealing 2 carpets, value 2l., the goods of 



Robert Dennison; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ROBERT DENNISON
. I am sub-steward of Gray's Inn—on the 29th of Dec., about two o'clock, some person had the keys of a set of chambers there, which are mine, and were to be let—about five o'clock that day I went to my office, and there I ascertained there had been a robbery—I went to the station and saw these carpets which had been taken from my chambers.





WILLIAM HOLDER
 (police-constable E 100.) At half-past four o'clock on the afternoon of the 29th of Dec, I saw the prisoner coining down the stairs of the prosecutor's chambers, which are No. 6, South-square, Gray's Inn, with these carpets—I asked what he was about to do with the carpets—he muttered something, but I did not understand him—he ran up stairs, and said to some person up stairs, "The policeman is below, say all is right"—I stood at the foot of the stairs, looking up, and the prisoner came down and two other persons followed him—I secured him—the others got away, but I held him—he dropped these carpets in the passage, and I took them—these are them—he wanted to know what I meant by holding him there, and wanted me to let him go—I said I should not let him go—I asked what he was going to do with the carpet, and I believe he said he was sent to carry it—I stated at the office that I asked him by whom he was sent, and where he was going to take it.

Prisoner's Defence. Two gentlemen touched me on the shoulder, and said did I want a job; I said, "Yes;" I went across some squares to this place; they told me to wait on the stairs, and they gave me this to take to Holboron.






EDWIN DURSTON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 23rd Oct., 1843, and confined one year)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

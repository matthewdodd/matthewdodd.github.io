. I lost this ass on the 25th of February, 1830; it used to stray about - I found it at Ealing about a fortnight after; it was a she ass, and a very remarkable one - I knew it to be mine; I had bought it seven weeks before; the person I bought it of knew her as well as I did.

            . I apprehended the prisoner, and a man named Haynes, early in the morning of the 27th of February, 1830; they had this ass, and a great quantity of lead, which it was carrying - they both said the ass belonged to them, and they had come from Harrow; they were remanded three times, and then discharged - on the Friday following the prosecutor applied to me, and the prisoner was taken again; but he broke out of Uxbridge gaol on Sunday, the 20th of March, 1830; the other day he was in custody on another charge, and I stated this - Haynes was brought here, and pleaded guilty.

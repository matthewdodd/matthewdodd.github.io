2213. 




JOHN STOREY
 was again indicted for

 stealing, on the 
14th of September, 2 spoons, value 1l. 10s., the goods of the 

East and West India Dock Company, his masters; and 




MARGARET STOREY



, for feloniously receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen.






JOHN GEORGE
. I went to search the prisoner's room, in Pell-street, I saw Margaret Storey take two spoons from a box, and I took them from her—I believe she is the wife of the other prisoner, John Storey—he gave no account of how he became possessed of them.





JOHN STRUTT
. The prisoner, John Storey, had access to the place where these spoons were, in the warehouse of the East and West India Docks—I found a box broken open there—I found spoons in the box, exactly corresponding in crest, and other particulars, with these two spoons—the box had been seen safe about a week before these two spoons were found at the prisoner's.

JOHN STOREY—


GUILTY
. Aged 50.—


Transported for Seven Years.

MARGARET STOREY—


NOT GUILTY
.

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. On the 4th of March, a little before ten o'clock, the prisonerpassed me in Rosemary-lane, with the bed on his back. I crossed over, and asked him where he brought it from? he said from Angel-gardens, and he was going to take it to Tower-hill, but he could not tell to what part - he said he was going to make a little money of it. Next morning the prosecutor claimed it.

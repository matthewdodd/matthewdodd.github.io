 from Wales to Canterbury, deposed, that he was in London on the 8th of August; that two women picked him up in Holborn, between six and seven in the morning; that one of them said, that her husband was his country-man, and would go with him to Wales if he would go home with her; that he went with her in order to see his country-man; that he went to a publick house in Turnmill-street


; that the prisoner, Langford, appeared to be mistress of the house; that he drank a good deal of liquor, and was much intoxicated; that Langford desired him to lie down upon the bed. He went to sleep, and got up again between eight and nine; that he had nine guineas all but two shillings when he laid down, which when be awaked he found was gone, and also the silk handkerchiefs; that the two prisoners were in the house with him when he went to sleep; he accordingly took them up, and the constable in searching Langford found a thirty six shilling piece upon her, which the prisoner described, as having two dents under the head.

             deposed, that Langford said before the justice, that she knew of nothing being stolen from the prosecutor, but a thirty-six shilling piece, a guinea, and two handkerchiefs.
Langford in her defence said, that the prosecutor brought two women to her house, me of which he said was his wife; that she knew the other woman. His wife desired he might he down, which he did; that she had two handkerchiefs by the wife's order; that she went into Holborn, and when she returned they were gone. Dun made the same defence.

MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM MARSHALL
. I am a coal heaver, and live at Brentford. On the 15th of September, about nine o'clock at night, I was at Brentford fair—the prisoner was standing near me—I felt somebody at my pocket—I looked, and saw the prisoner's hand in my right-hand trowsers pocket, in which was a crown-piece—I am not certain whether I had a shilling or not—I laid hold of her hand, and told her she had put her hand in my pocket, and taken a crown-piece out—she said she had not, and was very abusive—I gave her to the policeman—I saw him find a crown-piece in the same hand which had been in my pocket—she tried to throw it away several times—this is my crown—I never spoke to her till I found her hand in my pocket.





JOHN HANSLOW
. I am a policeman. I was called by the prosecutor—he said the prisoner had robbed him of a five-shilling piece—I took her, and found in her hand a crown-piece—she gave no account of it then.

Prisoner. Q. Did he not tell you he gave me 6d. to go with him? A. No.

Prisoner's Defence. He came to me, and asked me to go with him for a walk—I went, and then he asked what he should give me, I said 5s., which he refused me at first, and then he gave it me—he gave me 6d. beside—he then said, if I would give him half-a-crown back, he would say nothing about it.




GUILTY
. * Aged 20.—

transported for Ten Years.

JOSEPH QUOIT
. I live with my father, Peter Quoit, a publican in Great Bath-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner came there and went into the yard—I suspected he had something—he went out of the yard, and out of the house—I followed him, and came up with him very nearly half a mile from the house—I took him into custody, and found the pot in his hat— this is it—it is my father's.




GUILTY
.** Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Justice Coleridge.

1507. 




MARY ALLEN
 and 




ELIZABETH YATES
 were indicted for

 stealing 28 yards of printed cotton, value 12s., the goods of 



James Orrock, and that Allen had been before convicted of felony.






HANNAH JAGGERS
. I live in New-street, Stratford. I went into Mr. Orrock's shop at Bow on the 30th of April, and saw the prisoners there with another, purchasing eight yards of quilling-net at 1/2 d. a yard—I saw Yates with a piece of print in her hand—she was covering it with her shawl—they left the shop all three together—the quilling was paid for—I told the shopkeeper and he went after them.





JAMES ORROCK
, linendraper, Bow. From information I received I went after the prisoners, and sent for a policeman at the same time—I kept my eye on the prisoners—I lost sight of one of them—Mr. Philpott went after one of them, while I went after the other—Mr. Philpott brought Allen and the print back—this is my print—the moment Jaggers told me I looked and missed it—I had seen it safe within a quarter of an hour before the prisoners came.





FREDERICK PHILPOTT
, greengrocer, Bow. I went after the prisoners and took Allen sitting on a step—soon after I took Yates, and found this print under her shawl.





JOHN PENROSE
 (policeman.) The prisoner were given into my charge with the print.

Allen's Defence. I went into the shop to buy some quilling, and met this girl on the road; I was coming back, and the other girl gave Yates a piece of print; I walked on, and this other girl ran away.

Yate's Defence. I was with Allen, she asked me to come and buy three yards of net; I said, "Yes;" the other girl took the print, brought it to me, and said, "Hold this;" I never saw that girl before.





WILLIAM BULL
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of Allen's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

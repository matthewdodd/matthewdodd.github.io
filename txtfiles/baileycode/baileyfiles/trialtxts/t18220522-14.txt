, and live in Quickset-row, New-road


. On the 30th of April, my breeches hung on the line to dry; a young man came up the yard, and took them off - my wife called out, I followed him up Brook-street - the prisoner was secured; he was not the man, who took them. There were two of them.

            . I was in the kitchen with my husband, and saw a man come up the yard, I thought he was the servant to a gentleman on the first floor. I saw him untie the string; I called out
"Stop thief!" followed, and in Brookstreet, some persons secured the prisoner - I found them under his coat.

            . I live in the New-road. I saw two lads running up violently in a direction from Humphries's - I heard the cry of Stop thief! and stopped the prisoner. I saw the breeches under his coat; he fell on his knees and begged forgiveness.

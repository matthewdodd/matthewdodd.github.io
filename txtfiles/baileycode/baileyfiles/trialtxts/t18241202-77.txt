. The prisoner hired one room in the early part of October - the articles stated in the indictment, were let with it - she was to pay 5 s. 6 d. a week. She staid nearly five weeks. She took another lodging at Mr. Shaw's, and they had her taken into custody. I went into the room and missed the sheets, blankets, and bolster - she then owed me three weeks rent.

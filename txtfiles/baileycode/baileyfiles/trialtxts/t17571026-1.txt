Lancelot Dobison. I am a publican
; the prisoner came into my house last Friday, and call'd for a pint of beer.
Q. Where do you live?
Dobison. I live in Beech lane


; the pot was missing as she was going away, and Elizabeth Green went after her, and took her with the pot upon her that is mentioned in the indictment.
Elizabeth Green. I live with Mr. Dobison. I had been cleaning the chamber pot, and had set it out at the back door to dry; the prisoner came into the house, and I went to draw a pint of beer to carry out to a neighbour; when I came back I missed the chamber pot, and suspecting the prisoner had taken it, I went after her and asked her for it; she drop'd it down, and said if it was mine I might take it. It is a pewter pot.
Q. How far had she gone?
E. Green. This was within a little way of my master's door.
[ The pot was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of it.

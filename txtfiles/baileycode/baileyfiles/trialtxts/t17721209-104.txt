            . I am a linen draper
 on Holborn-bridge


. About half after nine in the morning of the 26th of November, a girl that lives in my house informed me somebody was taking some handkerchiefs out of the window; a pane of glass in the window had been broke by accident, through which the person 
               
                  drew
               


             the handkerchiefs. I immediately sent 
               
                  William
                   Fisher
               



             after the thief.


                  William
                   Fisher
               



            . I pursued the prisoner; he was stopt by the croud; I saw him throw down the handkerchiefs; I took them up; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I saw the prisoner put his hand in at the window, and take out the handkerchiefs, which I informed Mr. Robinson of.
The prisoner in his defence denied having committed the fact.



               Guilty

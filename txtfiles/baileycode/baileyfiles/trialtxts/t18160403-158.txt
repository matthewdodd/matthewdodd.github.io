JOHN HENRY HEIATMON. About ten o'clock at night, I and a friend were passing the Royalty Theatre, and four or five men together met us, and pushed us from one to the other; a man took hold of my watch, and drew it out of my pocket; I felt him; my friend was going to assist me; the prisoner had hold of him by the collar, and kept him tight, so that he could not, and kept saying to him, I will take your part. We delivered the prisoner to the watchman.
Prisoner Defence. I was going along, and I saw these persons together making noise, and after the mob had rspesed, a man said that I had taken the watch; I told him he was very wrong in saying that of me, and when the officers searched me, they found nothing but a few halfpence.

WILLIAM BROWN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of June, 7 pairs of shoes, value 1l., the goods of 



Edward Healey.






ELISA STONEHAM
. I am in the service of Mr. Edward Healey, a ladies' shoemaker, in High Holborn. On the 29th of June, I was coming down stairs to the kitchen, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning—when I got to the shop, I saw the prisoner in the back shop—I asked him what he wanted—he said he was waiting for the man who was taking down the shutters, that the shopman had spoken to him, and that he had some work for him—I went to call the shopman in, when the prisoner passed me and ran out—he had a bag under his arm—he was afterwards brought back.





CHARLES PAYNE
. I live in Wardour-street, Soho. About half-past seven o'clock, I was going along Holborn, and saw the prisoner run out of the shop furiously—Stoneham came to the door—I pursued the prisoner up Brownlow-street into Warwick-lane—he threw the bag from under his arm—I took it up, brought him back to Healey's shop, and he identified the property in the bag as his—I gave him to the policeman.





JAMES TURNER
, (police-constable F 86.) I received the prisoner in custody from Payne, with the bag containing these seven pairs of shoes.





EDWARD HEALEY
. These shoes are all mine.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

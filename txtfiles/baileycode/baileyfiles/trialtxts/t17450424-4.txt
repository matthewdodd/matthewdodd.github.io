Valentine Caton . I live by the Black Dog in Shoreditch. On Thursday the 28th of March in the afternoon, the Prisoner went along Shoreditch with a carpet; I asked him if he would sell it, he said yes; I asked him what he would have for it, he asked something over twenty shillings, and I gave him half a guinea for this carpet: he said, he had it from a gentleman who was breaking up house and going to Holland. I went into Duke's Place, and shewed it to one of those people, and he said it was stole from a gentleman in such a place .

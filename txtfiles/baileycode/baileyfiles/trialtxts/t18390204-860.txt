JOHN BOURN
. I am foreman to Messrs. Mullens, pawnbrokers, of Staverton-row, Newington. On the 31st of December the prisoner came and offered me a pair of diamond ear-rings to pawn, and a gilt snap—I saw what the ear-rings were, and asked what she wanted for them—she said 4s.—I asked how she came by them—she said she bought them in Wiltonler, shire, and gave 3s. for them—I asked what her name was—she said Wel and she lived in Cold-harbour-lane—I felt satisfied they were not hers, and gave, her into custody—the ear-rings are worth 7l.





CELIA ROUBEL SMALL
. I am the wife of William Small. We live in Hill-terrace, Grove-lane, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell—the prisoner was my nursery-maid for about seven weeks. These are my ear-rings—I missed them on the 27th of December, four days before she offered them to pawn, but I did not mention it to her, as I had no suspicion of her—they

were taken from a box in a glass-drawer in my bed-room—these other things are mine—this purse was taken from ray work-box, and this collar from one of the children's drawers; this flounce from a closet, and the other things from different drawers—they were all found on the prisoner.





THOMAS HOOKWAY
 (police-constable P 13.) I was sent for, and took the prisoner—I found these things on her, which the prosecutrix has identified.

Prisoner. I did not take the ear-rings from my mistress's drawer.




GUILTY
. Aged 17—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutrix.

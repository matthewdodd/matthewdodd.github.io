            . I am the wife of John Knight; the prisoner is my son, by my former husband - he lived with us, and used to sell things in the street. On the 10th of September, he saw me put 27s. in a purse, and 2s., and some halfpence in a basin, into a large sailor's chest in my bed-room, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he was to have slept at home that night as usual, but he went away, and did not come home - I then looked at the chest; it was still locked as I had left it, but the money was gone: there was no other person in the house.
JOHN KNIGHT. On the 11th of September my wife missed the money; on the 12th we went to Brentford fair, and there we saw the prisoner - he saw his mother, and ran away; I got between the shows, and took him.

             (Police-constable H 53). I took the prisoner, and found this purse on him, which the prosecutor identifies as the one the money was in.

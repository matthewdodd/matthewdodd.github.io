GEORGE WITT. I am in the service of the East India Company
. On the 25th of July I was on the Paddington stage, opposite Regent-crescent


; I felt a jerk at my pocket, looked round, and saw a boy getting down from behind the coach; I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone; I saw the same boy stopped - I lost sight of him in getting down from the coach; I then saw him running, and several persons pursuing him; I think I should know him again; the handkerchief was found in the crescent, which he had passed; a girl who was drawing some children in a chaise threw it to me.

            . I was with my brother on the coach on the 25th of July; he clapped his hand to his pocket, and called out Stop thief! I turned round, and saw the prisoner running away - he threw the handkerchief over the pales; I lost sight of him while I got off the coach, but I observed him enough to be certain that the prisoner is the boy.

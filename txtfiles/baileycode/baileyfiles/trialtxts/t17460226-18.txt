            ) What have you to say to this Tea-Kettle and Curtains ?
Harper. I did not take these things in: But she come suddenly to my Spouse; said, her Husband had got no Money, and they were almost ready to starve, and my Wife let her have a Loaf and Cheese, and 6 d. more the next Day. She wanted to sell it for 6 d. more. I said, if you will bring the right Proprietor I will give you 6 d. more for it, for I am afraid you have stole it.




               Guilty 10 d.

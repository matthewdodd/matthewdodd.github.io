ARTHUR ASHTON. I lost a handkerchief on the 18th of August while I was in the Court of Chancery


; I did not feel it go - it was taken from my left-hand coat pocket; I missed it when I left for it; I saw it again in the robingroom.
Prisoner. Q. How long had you used it before? A. Perhaps about half an hour.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I saw the prisoner attempting a gentleman's pocket - I took him and searched him, and this handkerchief was found secreted in his breeches.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up on the floor, as any one might have done; I stook there for half an hour, and then the officer called and took me.

            , we live in Brownlow street


. On the 1st of February, a little boy came into the house, I came out of the parlour into the shop, to serve the least prisoner with a pair of shoes, the other two prisoners staid at the door; one of them said to the other, go in, he is gone in, Farrell was the boy, that came in first, about three o'clock, in the afternoon. Farrell came into the shop, and asked me to fit him with a pair of shoes, the other two stood still at the door; one said to the other he is gone in, go in. They came in, the three prisoner's are the three boys that came in.

                  Webb
               



             set in the chair, then Hugh Farrell said you are fitting; Webb said yes, fit me with a pair, I got up on the steps, I missed Holmes, I looked and saw him in my parlour. I then looked up by the fire place and I missed my watch; I then got hold of him by the collar, I said you villian you have got my watch; I called Mrs. Chapman my lodger down; Holmes struck me, to get away, in the scuffle the watch was dropped in the parlour close to the door; Holmes got away from me, I ran to the door after him and called stop thief; my lodger afterwards found the watch on the floor, she delivered it to me, the prisoner was stopped by a gentleman coming by, I thought the prisoner had run out with the watch.
This is the watch, it is my husbands watch. The other two boys sat still, they never moved once, a pair of shoes was thrown in the kennel, I cannot tell how they came there. I was so frightened, when I cried out stop thief. Mr. Godfrey was at hand he ran after him; I detained the othe boys immediately, after I found Holmes had gone out.
MRS. CHAPMAN. I lodge in Mrs. Spencer's house, I came down stairs, and saw the shop full of people, I saw something lay between two chairs. I took it up, it was Mr. Spencers watch, I said Mrs. Spencer, here is your watch. The prisoner Holmes had gone away.

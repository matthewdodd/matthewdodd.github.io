THOMAS HAVERS
. I live in York-place, Pentonville. I was walking on the pavement in Hamilton-place, New-road, with a lady, a last night about nine o'clock and felt hand at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the act of taking his hand off a pocket-handkerchief, which was stuffed through the iron rails into a hedge which grows there—I saw his hand on it—I instantly seized him, and said, "You have stolen my handkerchief "—he said, "I have not done any thing at all"—I said, "There was no body near you; you have taken the handkerchief"—there was not a soul within twenty yards of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM NICHOLSON NAGGS
 (police constable E 4.) I received the prisoner in charge, with the handkerchief in his hand.

Prisoner. I beg for mercy. 


GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—

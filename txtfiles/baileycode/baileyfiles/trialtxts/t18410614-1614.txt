GEORGE BLAKE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of May, 21 yards of carpet, value 1l. 10s.; 1 hearth-rug, value 15s.; and 20 yards of drugget, value 1l., the goods of 



John Fish wick.






HARRIETT CROOK
. I am servant to Mr. John Fishwick, of Laurence Pountney-lane—this carpet, hearth-rug and drugget now produced are his property—they were sent by Holloway to be beat on Thursday, the 14th of May—I and the cook delivered them to him.





JAMES HOLLOWAY
. I am carman to Mr. Fishwick. I received the carpet and other things, and took them to Islington-fields to beat—I brought them back again to Laurence Pountney-hill—I took one parcel down to the house, leaving the cart in the street, and when I returned to it, these articles were gone.





JAMES GOLDSTONE
 (City police-constable, No. 440.) I was on duty in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner turn up Swithin's lane, which is about fifty yards from Laurence Pountney-lane, with all this carpet—it was a very large bundle, and tied very slightly—he dropped the hearth-rug, and one piece of carpet, then went as far as New-court, and dropped the drugget, and another piece of carpet—I took him, and found the other four pieces of carpet upon him—I asked where he got them from, and where he was going to take them—he said he could make no reply.

The Prisoner called






ROBERT MASTERS
. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Church-lane, Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner for twelve months—I employed him last July—he worked for me about seven months, and was taken ill about five months ago, went to St. Luke's Infirmary, and was there till the be-ginning of May—he called on me about the 13th of May, to employ him again, but I could not—I told him to call in about a fortnight—I will employ him again, if the Court would allow him.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prisoner afterwards finding an inquiry was to be made, admitted that the evidence of Masters was incorrect.)

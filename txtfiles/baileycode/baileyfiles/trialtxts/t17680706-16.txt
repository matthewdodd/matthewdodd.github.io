            . I live at Mile-end


; on the 2d of April I lost the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) from out of my chamber and closet; the prisoner was my weekly servant
 about ten days, I suspected her; I went to Shoreditch work house, where her father-in-law was, and desired a person there to give me when he saw her, as she was absconded; on the 28th of May that person gave me notice of her being there; she owned to the cloak, bonnet, and apron; after that she took my wife down the yard, and owned to all the things; after that she owned the same to me; I got some of them again; she told me she had pawned the buckles at Mr. Bellamy's, where I found them (produced and deposed to)

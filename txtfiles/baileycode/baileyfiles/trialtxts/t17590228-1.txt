, and live in Star-alley in Fen-church street


; on Wednesday the 14th of February I was in my cellar, there is a light comes into the shop: I heard some body come into the shop; I call'd, but no body answered. I went up, and there was the prisoner; I follow'd her out of the shop, and took her at the door, and found my own wearing hat in her apron, and took it out; it is not quite new, I had left it in the shop, about three yards from the door of the shop.
Q. What was it worth when new?
Dean. It was worth 12 shillings.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going by this gentleman's door, and saw that hat lying on the threshold; I was going to rap at the door, to know if it belong'd to the people there, and he came and took hold of me, and charged me with a robbery.

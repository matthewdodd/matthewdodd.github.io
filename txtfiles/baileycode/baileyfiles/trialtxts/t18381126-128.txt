WILLIAM WOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of November, 1 coat, value 1l. 6s.; the goods of 



Barnet Manning Collion and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






DENNIS CURTIS
. I live with Mr. Barnet Manning Collins and his partner. On the 1st of November a gentleman came to the shop and priced some things—he asked to look at a coat—I went to show him one, and it was gone—I went down Wild-street, and saw the prisoner with the coat on—I followed him, and saw the ticket on it—I seized him-here is the shop mark on it—I am thirteen years old.





GEORGE MARCH
 (police-constable F 78.) I was called on the evening of the 1st of November to take the prisoner—he was then in the shop and the coat was lying on the counter.

Prisoner. I was in a public-house in Drury-lane on the night in question, having a pint of porter-a man came in, with the coat on his arm, and offered it for sale for 15s.—I offered him 12s., which I gave him, and went out, and at the corner of Queen-street this lad came and caught hold of it—he said it was his master's, and that I had stolen it from his shop—I asked him where his master resided—he told me in Drury-lane—I went there, and the master said it was his—I polled it off, and gave it him-l told him, if he would go to the public-house, I would point out the person that I bought it of.





DENNIS CURTIS

re-examined. He asked my master in the shop to go to the public-house—I had seen the coat secure about five minutes before.





JAMES REDDINGTON
 (police-constable E 62.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

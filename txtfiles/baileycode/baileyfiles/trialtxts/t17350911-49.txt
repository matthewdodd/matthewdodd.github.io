            . The Prisoner has been Sir Robert Walpole's Bricklayer about eleven Years. On the eighteenth of August, he came to Sir Robert's House at Chelsea


, and was in the Pantry amongst the Plate. for being well known in the Family, we had no mistrust of him.

            . I live with Mr. Gilpin, a Goldsmith by Lincoln's Inn Back Gate. On the nineteenth of August, the Prisoner came to our Shop, and said, he had a little piece of Plate to dispose of, and then he produced this Escallop'd Silver Salver. Seeing a Crest on it, I asked him whose it was. He said he did not know, for it was left him by his first Wife. I told him I must stop the Plate till he could satisfy me how he came by it. He asked me what I meant by that, and said, he could soon fetch one that knew him; and so he went and fetched Mr. Stafford from the Stamp Office. Mr. Stafford told me who the Prisoner was, and said that he believed him to be an honest Man - I looked into a Book of Arms, and thought the Crest was like the Duke of Chandos's. But on my going thither, I was told it was Sir Robert Walpole's. I went to Sir Robert's, and there the Plate was owned.
Mr. Wright again. This is the same Salver that was lost out of Sir Robert's Pantry.
The Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

RICHARD WATERS. On the 5th of November I was walking up Ayre-street-hill


, about two minutes past six o'clock in the evening; I lost my handkerchief from my right hand coat pocket; I felt a slight pressure upon me, and I missed my handkerchief; I turned sharply round, and saw three men - the prisoner was one, and he ran away - I followed, and called Stop thief! he turned a corner, and threw my handkerchief down, and was stopped by an officer; I picked my handkerchief up; I am certain of his person.

            , in Gun-yard, Houndsditch, is a customer of my master's. The prisoner came to our house on the 16th of Sept. at 6 in the evening, and said he came from Mr. Lazarus, his master, in Gun-yard, Houndsditch, and wanted some silver fringe, the same as he had had before, (his master had had some before) he wanted twenty ounces; I told him we had not so much; he said he must have as much as we had got, for it was to be-made up immediately; I delivered him eight ounces, he took it, and came again in half an hour, and told me he wanted a silver lace for his young master's waistcoat; that gave me reason to suspect him; I said he could not possibly have it till the next morning; and early in the morning I sent to his master, and he sent word, if the prisoner came again to stop him, for he had discharged him his service, and he had not sent him; the next morning the prisoner came, and I sent for his master, and got a constable and secured him.

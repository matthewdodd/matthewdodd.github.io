            . I was standing in my master's back shop on the 21st of January; the prisoner came in and took two pair of shoes off the shelf; I immediately ran after him and cried out, Stop thief! when I came up to him, he threw the shoes into the dirt. (The shoes produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.

Prisoner's Defence.
I had been in the shop before, cheapening some shoes; I came in again afterwards, and took the shoes from the shelf, and I threw the money down upon the counter.
Q. to Poyner. Is that true?
Poyner. It is not.

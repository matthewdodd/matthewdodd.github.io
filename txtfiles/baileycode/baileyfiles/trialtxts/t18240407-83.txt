            . I lived with my brother Edward in Carthusian-street. He keeps a confectioner's shop there; he has a customer named Rawley, who lives at Bethnal-green. On the 22d of March the prisoner came to the shop, and said Rawley had taken a shop in South Audley-street, and that he had come from him, and wanted 7 lbs. of stone blue, a can of barley-sugar, and 2 lbs. of refined juice. I gave them to him in consequence of this statement, and on the 24th he came again with this written order (producing it, read): -
"Mr. Wilkins, - I should like you to send by bearer 7 lbs barley-sugar, 7 lbs Spanish juice, 7 lbs. sugar-candy, and charge the lowest price, and when you call I will pay you.
"W. RAWLEY."
In consequence of this letter I let him have the barley-sugar, but had not got the other goods.

                  RAWLEY
               



            . This paper is not written by me. I never authorized the prisoner to get these goods; he lived with me two years ago.

            . I am servant to Mr. Devie Robertson, who is a wine-merchant
, and lives in Bedford-square


. On the 31st of March, about five o'clock in the evening, I saw a man in the area and sent him away. He beckoned to a man, who I believe to be the prisoner. In about ten minutes I heard the area-door open, went to see what it was, and saw the prisoner with the great-coat on his arm, which he had taken from the servants' hall - I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

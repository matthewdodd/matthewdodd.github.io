JOHN LUCCOCK
. I live in Caroline-street, Whitechapel, and am a seafaring man. On the 30th of July, I was in Whitechapel, about a quarter past four o'clock, and this young rascal made a snatch at my pocket—my mistress said, "There is some one at your pocket"—I said, "It is a piece of nonsense"—I went on till I came opposite Mr. May's—I then felt something at my pocket—I turned, and caught the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand.





WILLIAM HOMER
. I am a police-constable. I was called to take the prisoner and the handkerchief—in taking him to the station-house, he was rescued from me by a gang of thirty or forty—I took one of them to Spitalfields station-house.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported For Seven Years.

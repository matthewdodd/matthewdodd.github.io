JOHN DALLESTON
. I am a carpenter, and live in Dorset-place, St. Pancras-road. I lost a smoothing-plane on the 8th of Dec., from an unfinished house in South-street, Pentonville—it had been carefully put away on the

Saturday night, cither on the top of the cupboard or on the shelf, and I missed it on Monday about eleven o'clock.

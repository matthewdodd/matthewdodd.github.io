            , a pawnbroker
, who lives in Whitechapel


. On the 6th of June, in the morning, I saw the prisoner waiting about the shop window for an hour, suspecting her, I went behind the counter - she came inside the door; three shawls hung to the ceiling - she pulled them down, then pulled down a child's dress and frock, and put them in her apron. I followed her out and secured her three doors off, and took them out of her apron - she went into fits, and made a sad piece of work.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I was much in liquor.

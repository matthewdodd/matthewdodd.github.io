            . I am the wife of William Henry Shoobert. We keep a cooper and turner's shop
, and sell combs - the prisoner and some others came there on the 30th of May to buy a kite - one of the other boys paid one penny for it - I saw the prisoner at the other window - he put his hand over, and took two packets of combs - he then went out of the shop - I called my husband, who went after him, and brought him back in about five minutes - I saw the prisoner put the combs over again to where he took them from - these are the combs.
WILLIAM HENRY SHOOBERT. I went after the prisoner, and took him two hundred yards off - I told him he must come back with me - I saw him put the two packets of combs into the window where they had been before - he had been in our shop the Saturday before.

            . I was standing at the door when my brother-in-law brought the prisoner back - I saw him take the two packets of combs from under his apron, and put them back into the window.

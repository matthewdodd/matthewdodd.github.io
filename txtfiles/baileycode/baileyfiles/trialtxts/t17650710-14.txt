            . I live in Wardour-street, St. Ann's, Westminster


. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment at several times. The prisoner us'd to chear at our house: the last day she was there, she put a large dish behind the water-tub, and eight knives and forks, in order to take them away; then we tax'd her with these things, which we had miss'd: she denied it at first, but at last she owned to all of them, and where she had pawned most of them: she had pawned one sheet, one silver spoon, and two flat-irons, to Mr. Andrews. I went there, and found a sheet, a spoon, and one flat-iron; and at Mr. Stockdell's, in Great Poultney-street, she had pawn'd some things; but I had only one spoon from thence. She pawn'd them in different names.

            . On the 28th of May, the prisoner plodg'd this sheet with me, the flat-iron on the 20th, and the spoon the 25th. (Produced in court; the prosecutor deposed to the spoon.)

I don't know what I did, for my mistress always made me drunk when I went there.

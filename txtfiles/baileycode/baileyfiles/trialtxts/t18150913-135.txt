            . My husband is a sawyer
. I lost two gowns and the other articles, mentioned in the indictment, on the 9th of August. I left my room between one and two for half an hour, during which time it was locked. When I was coming home, I met the prisoner coming out of the door, with a coloured gown of mine in his hand; which I took particular notice of, together with a bundle wrapt up in a white apron of mine. I said, good God! you have my gowns; how came you by them; he was immediately secured, and taken to St. Ann's watchhouse. When I went up stairs, the door was open, and the lock had been picked,

            . I am a beadle of the parish, and was sent for, to take the prisoner into custody; but when I arrived, somebody had taken him to the watchhouse. I searched him, and all the the things were found on him.

            . All these things are my husbands property.

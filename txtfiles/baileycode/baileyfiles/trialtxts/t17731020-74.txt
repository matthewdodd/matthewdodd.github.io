             deposed, that the prisoner begged her to give her a lodging, which she did; that after she had been at her house about a fortnight, she missed the things mentioned in the indictment; that she found them by the prisoner's direction at Mr. Cordy's, a pawnbroker, on Snow Hill.
- Cordy produced the goods; the prisoner had pawned them at different times.

To be sure I did pawn them; I intended to restore them to her again.

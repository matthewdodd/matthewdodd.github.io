: The prisoner was put in by the auctioneer, on the 16th of September, to lot the things; I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment, on Sunday morning, the 18th; I went to Bow-street, on Monday, the 19th, having a suspicion that the prisoner, and a man of the name of Williams, had broke open my box, and stolen the cloaths, and in the evening I went with an officer to search the prisoner's lodgings, in St. Martin's Church-yard, where I found four pillow-cases, and a damask table-cloth, the property of Mr. Beat; I had seen them about a fortnight before.

            . My husband's name is William: the prisoner worked for me, I went up stairs about business, the prisoner took my purse, and nine shillings in money in it, out of a box, and went away, and I never saw her again till the Wednesday after, when I found her at the Frying-pan in Brick-lane. I asked her for my money: she said, D - n you, you can't hang me, for I did not break a lock, (I had left the box open before and after that) I took it out; I carried her before justice Fielding, there she owned she took my money, but said she had none of it left; she had seen me put it there the Saturday before.

            . I am constable, and had the prisoner in charge; I asked her how she could use her mistress so; she said she did not know, but was very sorry for it; at the justice's she said the same. The justice asked her if she had any of the money left; she said no, she had none left.

She robb'd me of an apron that I was sent with to pawn.

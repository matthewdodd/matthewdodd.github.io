            . I am a salesman
 in Monmouth-street, the prisoner was my servant
, he had taken a waistcoat of mine on a Saturday, and a neighbour of mine saw him with it on on the Sunday, and he told me of it; I challenged him with it, he owned it; then I challenged him with taking other things, he acknowledged he had, and they were found again by his information, at a pawnbroker's, three waistcoats and two pair of breeches.

            . The prisoner pledged a waistcoat with me the 12th of September, for 2 s. 6 d. in his own name (produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
At the time I took these things I was in great distress, people used to be coming after me for money that I owed; I did not take them away with intent to deprive my master of them.

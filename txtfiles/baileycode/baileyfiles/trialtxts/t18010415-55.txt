             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Upon the alarm of thieves being given, I secured the peter-boat, and found a sack of barley in it; I immediately took the peter-boat along-side the barge, the nails of the tarpaulin had been forced; the barge was laden with barley, to be taken to Brentford to be malted; I belonged to Messrs.

            . I am a serjeant in the guards
. On the 15th of April the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) were all taken out of my parlour. I missed them about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening; some out of a closet, and some in a basket on the table. The door had been forced open. I got the crier to cry the things. Afterwards William Salmon came and informed me he suspected the persons that did it, and one the 16th, he sent for me, and informed me the three prisoners had been at his house, and were gone to Tothill-fields Bridewell. He and I went and met them coming out. We stopped them. We found a neckcloth on Thomas Jones's neck, which my wife has swore to. They made great resistance.

             and Pittman got away, but were soon retaken.


                  Sarah 
                  Hunt 
               



            . I am wife to the prosecutor. (She mentioned the things lost; also the stock produced in court.) This I know to be one that was taken out of our house. I have washed for the gentleman that owns it two years. It is marked W.
William Salmon. I live at the Bricklayers Arms, at the corner of Strutton-Ground. The night of this robbery the three prisoners were together at my house three quarters of an hour. They were gone some time before the crier came. He came about ten. Then I mistrusted they must be the persons.
The rest as the prosecutor had said before.

                  Limes 
               



             deposed he was near when the prisoners resisted, and two got away, and that he helped to retake them.

                  Brown 
               



            . I am a cooper. I was drinking at Mr. Salmon's that Saturday evening, and I saw the three prisoners there. They went out together about twenty minutes after eight.

             and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Cane 
               



            , two children, deposed they were near the prosecutor's door, and saw the three prisoners come out with a basket and bundle that evening. Cane, when she got home, told her father-in-law, Mr. Salmon, of it, which he deposed strengthened his suspicion.

            's Defence.
I am a Taylor
, and was discharged. I met with 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Jones 
               



             at the Sugar-loaf in Fleet-street, he desired me to take a walk with him to Totthill-fields Bride well. We went to Mr. Salmon's, and had some porter and radishes and bread and butter that Saturday. We all came out together, parted at Charging-cross, and went home to our lodgings.

                  Jones 
               



            's Defence.
The great anxiety of mind I labour under, in a manner deprives me of the means to defend myself, yet I am fully persuaded, from your integrity, my innocence will appear. I cannot but be astonished to hear people, instigated by corrupt hearts, lay false things to my charge. I hope your lordship will let me have an opportunity to call in a person who was with me when I bought that neckcloth. I bought three in all.
Pitmans's Defence.
I am a plaisterer
 by trade. I went to take a walk with Jones. I know nothing of the matter.


                  Thomas 
                  Jones

                  Robert 
                  Harris 
               



            , a chair-maker, who said he was a musician; that he met him going down Holborn. He desired him to walk with him, saying, he was going to buy some linen; they went into Field Lane, and he saw the prisoner T. Jones buy four neckcloths. Being asked how they were marked, said with the letter W at the end. Being asked what colour, he said in white, but the neckcloth produced was marked with red silk.

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 10th of September, the prisoner came, and said he wanted a pair of shoes for a customer - I knew him before. He looked at several pairs, and at last said,
"These will do; what is the price?" I said, seven shillings. He asked for a pair of laces, and while I turned my back to get them, he snatched the shoes off the counter, ran out, and closed the door after him. I did not know where to find him. I had not seen him for three years before - he did not pay for them.
JOHN WILLIAMS, JUN. I was in the shop when the prisoner asked for the shoes, and while my mother was getting a pair of laces, I saw him take them off the counter and run away; I called for the apprentice, who ran after him, but he got off.
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.

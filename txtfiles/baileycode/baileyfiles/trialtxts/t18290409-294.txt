. About ten minutes before ten o'clock, on the 9th of April, I saw the prisoner and another come by- the other lad crossed, took this ham, and gave it to the prisoner, who put it under his coat, and walked off with it; a neighbour gave information to the prosecutor, who came out and pursued him; I saw the prisoner throw down the ham in Spring-street, and the watchman took him.

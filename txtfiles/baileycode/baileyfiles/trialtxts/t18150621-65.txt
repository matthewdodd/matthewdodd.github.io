ROBERT BRANCH. I am a servant
 to George Burchell, I put three pair of shoes into the area to be cleaned, on the 22nd of May. I went into the pantry; and after remaining there some time about my business, I heard a noise, and turning round, I saw the next witness and the prisoner in the kitchen. The witness told me that he saw the prisoner steal the shoes; and brought him back.

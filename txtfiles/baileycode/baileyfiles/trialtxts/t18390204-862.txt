JOHN ANDREW LYON
. I am the brother of Washington Lyon, who lives with me in the Kent-road. On the 17th of January, at seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the parlour window open—my attention was drawn to it by my mother, who was the first up—the coats and a cloak were gone from the passage—there had been one coat of mine and two of my brother's—the cloak had been taken from there, but was left in the parlour, near the window, which had been got up by some force—we went out, and saw a strange footmark on the garden-beds—this is my coat, and these are my brother's.





FRANCIS PATRICK
 (police-constable P 233.) I was on duty at eight o'clock that morning, and met the prisoner in the Kent-road, with another man—the prisoner had these coats on him—I took him.





JOHN COLES
 (police-constable M 78.) I saw the prisoner taken—the other man had this Petersham great-coat on his arm—the, prisoner had these other two—the bill against the other man was thrown out. 


GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

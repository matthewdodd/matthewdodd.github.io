, living at Aldgate


. The prisoner brought somegoods to our house, from Messrs. Stock and Co., on the 12th of December, about five o'clock in the afternoon; at that time two dozen and eleven gloves laid on the counter. I missed them in two minutes, and charged him with the theft - he said nothing; I went round the counter, he opened his wrapper, and the gloves fell out. I sent for an officer; he said he could not help it, he did not go to do it - they were tied up in dozens. I am sure they fell out of his wrapper.

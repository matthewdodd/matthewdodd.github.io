1394. 




JAMES HURLEY



, stealing 15lbs. weight of mutton, value 12s., the goods of 



Sarah Floyd, having been before convicted.






SARAH FLOYD.
 I keep a shop at Greenwich. On 12th March I was sitting in my parlour—I heard some one in my shop—I looked, and saw the prisoner with a basket—I took it from him, and found in it a leg and loin of mutton of mine—he had not paid me for it, and he had no business with it.

Prisoner. I never was in the shop at all. Witness. I took the basket and mutton from him, and sent the shopman after him—I am sure he is the man.





WILLIAM CHAPMAN.
 I am foreman to Mrs. Floyd. I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner about 200 yards from the shop—I followed, and caught him—I brought him back, and gave him the basket and let him go, as there was no policeman about.

Prisoner. I was very bad at home. Witness. I saw him backwards and forwards by the shop three of four nights before.





WILLIAM WELDON
 (policeman, R 40.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 9th May, 1842, confined three months)—he is the man—he has been summarily convicted since.




GUILTY.*† Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Recorder.

            . I live opposite the prosecutor. On Thursday evening, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I saw four young chaps standing together next door - the prisoner was one; I saw him cross over to a baker's, and then to Foster's - he stood at the window. One of the others went in to buy something, in the mean time the prisoner stepped in, and took the jar of honey out - I overtook him immediately with it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I lost these Goods out of the Lodging which I let to the Prisoner, ready furnished; he was to pay 3 s. for the first Week, and 2 s. 6 d. a Week afterwards: He was not there above a Week. I broke open the Door of his Room and found these Things missing. He owned to me, that he sold the Chimney-Glass and Sconces, and the Feather-Bed.

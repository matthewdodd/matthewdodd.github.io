            . I am the Blackwall carrier
. On the 1st of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, this lamp-shade was tied to the tail of my cart, which was going on between Whitechapel


 and Commercial-road


. I had a parcel to deliver; and going round the cart, found the cord cut, and the shade gone, with a prickle which it was in. Jones brought the prisoner to me with it a week after; it was safe in Leadenhall-street. The burner was in the basket with it. I bought it of Messrs. Pellatt and Co.

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 1st of September I was in Gulston-street, and observed the prisoner coming along with this glass-shade in his hand, done up in brown paper. I asked what he had there. He said a glass bowl, and that it was made for him by one Abrahams, of Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, and he gave 7 s. 6 d. for it. I sent to Abrahams, and in consequence of what he said, I detained the prisoner, and found the prosecutor out a week afterwards. He had not got the prickle.

WILLIAM BRIDGETT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



John Pegrum, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I was in the Hackney-road on the 11th of August—I saw the prisoner and another one in Hackney-road—I watched them for two hours—I saw them go up to the prosecutor—the other took hold of his arm, and the prisoner took this handkerchief out of his pocket—I saw him take it partly out in the Curtain-road—I followed them to Worship-street, and there he took it quite out—the prosecutor was drunk—I shoved against him, and gave him a black eye.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where were you when you saw

the handkerchief taken? A. About twenty yards behind—I had been following him two hours—I knocked the prosecutor down because he had been hoaxed, and was drunk—I ran against him in catching hold of the prisoner—I saw the prisoner come from the back of Shoreditch church—I was in plain clothes—I saw him chuck the handkerchief down—a young man took it up, and gave it to me.





JOHN PEORUM
. This is my handkerchief—it has my name on it—I was tipsy.

Cross-examined. Q. Where had you been? A. At a public-house.





AARON PAINE
 (police-constable H 166.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

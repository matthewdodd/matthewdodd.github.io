             deposed, on Robinson's telling her of this, she went to Mr. Blower, suspecting the prisoner might have gone there with it, and found he had bought some sat of him.

Mr. Blower deposed, he had bought fat of the prisoner several times, particularly that day, 7 stone; that he brought it in a basket; that the prisoner at his first coming to his shop, which was about a month before told him he was a butcher, and lived at Barnet, that he kept Newgate market.
The prisoner in his defence said, the fat was given him by his fellow servant.

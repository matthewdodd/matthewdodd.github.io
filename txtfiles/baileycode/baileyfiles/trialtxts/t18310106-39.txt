            . I am in the employ of 
               
                  William

            , a pawnbroker
, at Islington


. On the 22nd of December, I saw the prisoner and another lad at his window; I told the young man of it, and directly saw the prisoner take this shawl down; the young man went, and took him - I got over the counter, and saw the shawl by his side - this is it.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it inside the door? A. Yes - I had hung it up myself; no one could take it without putting their hand round a corner - they could take it without going into the shop.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have the shawl.
Prisoner. A young man took it down, and the witness came and punched me. Witness. I gave him a thump of the head, and was going to let him go - my master had told me to do so with any of these petty things.

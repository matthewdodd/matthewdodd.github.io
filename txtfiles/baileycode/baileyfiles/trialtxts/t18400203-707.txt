CHARLES DAVIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of February, 201bs. weight of lead, value 6s., the goods of 



Thomas Peckham Grout and another, and fixed to a building.






GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
. I am a policeman. On the 2nd of February, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Broad-street, St. Giles's, with a bundle—I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Only some things which my father gave me last night"—I said, "What does it consist of?"—he said "Lead"—he threw it down, and tried to get away—I took him into custody, took him to the station-house, and found this knife in his pocket—it appears to have been used to cut lead—Etheridge took up the lead—I made inquiry, and found it came from the roof of Grout's lodging-house, at the corner of Lawrence-lane, Church-street, St. Giles's—the whole of the roof had been stripped—Etheridge compared the lead.





RICHARD ETHERIDGE
. I am a policeman. I was in company with Restieaux when he took the prisoner—I afterwards went with Grout and fitted the lead to the roof of the house, and it tallied in all respects—the prisoner's clothes and shoes were all covered with white from the brick-work.





THOMAS PECKHAM GROUT
. I and my father keep this house. I saw the lead compared, and it fitted in every respect—the prisoner had lodged in the house thirteen or fourteen days—I know nothing further of him.

Prisoner's Defence, A young man asked me to carry it as far as Holborn for him; the policeman took me, but did not offer to stop to take the other.

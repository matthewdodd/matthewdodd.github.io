                  , and certain other persons unknown, in a certain vessel, known by the name of the Princess of Wales, lying on the river Thames
            , Oct. 4
. *
Robert Harris. I am part owner of the vessel called, the Princess of Wales, and belong to the corn trade. Thomas Lake, the master of her, came to me on the 4th of Oct. and told me he had lost the fore-sail, the flying gibb, and a piece of hercer; containing about 15 or 20 fathom, and that on board the next vessel to me, which was a Holland's trader, there was a man who saw the 2 prisoners cut them away. We got a warrant from justice Rickards, and took them up, and charged them with it before the justice, and they both denied it. I advertised the things, and on the 8th day the carpenter of the Dawkins, captain Beladine, came to me and told me he had seen on board their vessel cordage and such sails, and that one 
               
                  John 
                  Chester 
               



            , a sailor on board his vessel, had taken them on board from out of the boat belonging to the prisoner's vessel, the prisoners being then in the boat. I went on board the vessel, and found the things there, upon which I apprehended 
               
                  John 
                  Chester 
               



            .
Thomas Lake. I am master of the Princess of Wales, the fore-sail and gibb, and some cordage, were taken from on board her.
Q. When did you see them on board last before they were taken away?
Lake. I saw them on board on the third in the evening, and missed them before 7 the next morning. On the 4th I acquainted Mr. Harris with it; we got a warrant and took up the two prisoners from on board the Amelia, which lay next but one to us. After that the carpenter of the Dawkins told us the things were on board their vessel; then we got a warrant and went on board, and found them there. Then we took 
               
                  John 
                  Chester 
               



             before the justice, and there he acknowledged that he received them, and opened the hatch, and tumbled them down.

            . Malone was a sailor on board the Amelia, I can't say any thing as to the other prisoner. I belong to the Britannia, captain Holderson. We first came along-side the Amelia. On the 20th of Sept. the ship Amelia came along side the Prince of Wales. On the third of October I saw 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Malone 
               



             between the hours of 12 and 1 in the morning on the 4th on board the Prince of Wales, and saw him take the flying gibb from the bolt-sprit end of her.
Q. Was it light or dark?
Cowen. It was a moon-light night.
Q. How near was you to him?
Cowen. I believe about 50 feet. I was looking out at the bulk head window, from the star-board side of the Britannia, we lay along-side her; I looked forward from the stern, and saw the two prisoners come over our deck, and go on board the Princess of Wales. Then Dudley went back and got in their ship's boat, I heard him rattle the oars of the boat; after Malone had cut the sail away, he let it fall into the boat, which was then underneath; they then rowed away.

            . The two prisoners brought these two sails and some cordage on board the Dawkins, where I belong, on the 4th of Oct. in the morning, and desired I'd put them down below, which I did under the fore-hatch; they said they'd come again for them in the afternoon. My brother came home in the same vessel that the prisoners belong to, by which means I became acquainted with them.

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of October Mr. Harris brought me a warrant to take up the two prisoners, which I did, and took them before justice Rickards, and they were committed. On the Tuesday following he brought me another to go on board the Dawkins; we went and found the sails and cordage, and brought them and Chester on shore, and we took him before the justice; there he owned he received the things of the two prisoners.
Q. to Lake. Did you see the sails that were taken out of the Dawkins?
Lake. I did, they are the same that were taken from on board the Princess of Wales.
Dudley's defence.
I went to receive some money on the third of October, for looking after a vessel, called the Polley, a snow from Barbadoes; coming up I asked 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Malone 
               



             to go with me to Mile-End, we went and staid there till 11 or 12 at night; then we hired a boat at Catharine-stairs, and went on board the Amelia; the boys were asleep, we fetched the bed and laid it on the quarter deck, we went forward and saw our boat lying there and the sails in her. We went and carried them to 
               
                  John 
                  Chester 
               



            , and he took them in, and gave us two bottles of wine.
Malone's defence.
I have no more to say than what he has already said. We found the sails in our boat and took them to Chester; as for cutting them away I never did.

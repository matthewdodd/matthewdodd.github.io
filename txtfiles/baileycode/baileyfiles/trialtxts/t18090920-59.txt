            . The prisoner is a soldier belonging to the guards
; we are in the habit of employing soldiers. On the 26th of August we employed the prisoner. About half after two I told the people they might go to dinner; a little while after I saw the prisoner in a particular situation, I asked the prisoner what he had got under his apron; he said nothing. I called the men up; we made him pull from under his apron a bag, containing twelve pounds of sugar. This is the bag of sugar; he had tied it round his waist.
Prisoner's Defence. I met a person, he sold the sugar to me in the street; he was a sailor.

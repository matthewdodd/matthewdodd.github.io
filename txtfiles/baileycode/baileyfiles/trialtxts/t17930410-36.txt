             sworn.
I lost a pair of shoes on the 8th of March; I am a shoe maker
, I was not at home, my wife was.
Mrs. BERNARD sworn.
I live in High-street, St. Giles's


, I keep a shoe maker's shop. On the 8th of March, I saw the prisoner at the bar, he came into my house between eight and nine at night, about half after eight, and asked me to shew him a pair of shoes, a pair of my best; I shewed him a pair, he said, they were rather too big for him and I let the shoes stand on the counter while I looked for a pair that was less; in the mean time he ran out with this pair, and I never saw no more of him till the 12th of March following, when they took him; I did not go after him only to the next door, because it was dark and I had nobody in the shop; on the 12th of March, he brought this sheet to the next door neighbour of mine to sell, and she stopped the sheet, and she came and called me and I went in and saw the man, and I took him to the justice and swore to him; he was in my house the week before that and he sold me a pair of shoes off his feet for another pair, and I gave him six-pence in money besides; I have never seen the shoes since.

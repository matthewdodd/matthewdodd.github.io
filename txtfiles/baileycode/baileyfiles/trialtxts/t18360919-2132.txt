JOSEPH CRANNIS
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
15th of September, 1 spoon, value 12s. 6d. the goods of 



Leonard Humphreys Baugh, his master.






LEONARD HUMPHREYS BAUGH
. The prisoner was my shopman—I missed the spoon, and was convinced it must be in his possession—it was found in his pocket—he was searched on my first floor—it had been among some old silver in the iron chest—it was not bent as it is new when taken from my chest—it has a private mark on it which I put on all my things.





FRANCIS KEYS
. I was sent for, and took this spoon from the prisoner's trowsers pocket in this paper.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

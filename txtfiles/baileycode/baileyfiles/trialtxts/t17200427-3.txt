             deposed that a Gentleman came up to her Bar about 8 a clock at Night, and told here there was a Fellow lurking about her House; that between 10 and 11 the Prisoner came to the Bar and took a Rump of Beef which hung there, but being pursued dropt it at the Door, that she saw him plain, and was sure the Prisoner was the same Person. The Cook-maid also deposed that she saw the Prisoner take the Beef, and that he lifted it up three times before be could get it off the Hook. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he had been drinking, and ran his Head against the Beef, and it fell; but it appeared by the Evidence that he dropt it 10 yards from the Place where it hung. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

            . I am an officer. I went to search the prisoner's house, I found the man's wife at home, she denied having any thing that I asked for. These things were found, which the prosecutor identified by the marks, here is callico, this is part of a piece of printed cotton, eight pieces of linen wrapper, and eight bits of carpet. The prisoner's wife had a gown on her back the pattern of this printed cotton.
Alport. The whole is my master's property.
Mr. Gurney. I believe the prisoner has lived a year and a half in the service of the prosecutors - A. I believe he has; until the preceding day I never had the least suspicion of him, and he came from a place where he had lived seven years, with a particular good character.
Leadbetter. The prisoner took a key that opened a large chest up stairs, he seemed to be anxious to get at a little drawer, I there found three rolls of bank notes, one containing sixteen pound, another thirty-five pound, and another roll containing twenty-nine pound, and some stock receipts, amounting in the whole to seven hundred pounds.
Prisoner's Defence. I request my property that is taken away for my wife and child.

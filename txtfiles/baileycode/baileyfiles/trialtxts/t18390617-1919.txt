CHARLES HOWES
. I am apprentice on board the Narcissus—the prisoner was on board the same vessel in the London Docks—I was there on the 19th of May—I had 2l. 11s. in a purse in my chest—I saw it safe on the 12th of May—on the morning of the 19th, the prisoner brought on board this suit of clothes, and a shirt and braces—I asked him where he got them—he said his uncle, Mr. Boyd, bought them—I then missed my purse and money, and found my chest open—I told the prisoner I was certain either he or the other lad on board had stolen it—on the 26th the prisoner was there again, and left about six o'clock that evening—I found the clothes in the other lad's chest—I asked the prisoner afterwards where the purse was, and he said in the forecastle, under one of the berths, but it was not there.





CHARLES FREDERICK SAYER
. I am a salesman. On the evening of the 15th the prisoner came to me, and I measured him for a suit of clothes, they were to come to 2l.—he bought a shirt and handkerchief, and after that he had the clothes.

Prisoner. The prosecutor said he had left his chest open on the Thursday—I brought some shirts from the East Indies and sold them—he knows that a boy brought me 10s. on board, and I bought these clothes out of my own money.

MARTHA LYALL
. I am a widow, and live in Craven-street, Strand. I was coming through the gate of Buckingham Palace, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of January—there was a small crowd—I felt the prisoner's hand on me, he ran away—I said, "Take him, he has robbed me "—I felt, and I had lost my purse—a gentleman took him, the prisoner said, "I saw a boy rob you, let me run and take him "—an officer came and took him—I received information going along the Bird-cage-walk, and said to the officer, "Search him "—I saw him find the purse, hanging in his boot, under his trowsers—it contained three sovereigns and 7s.—it was mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What do you know it by? A. By there being two different slides on it, one much larger than the other, and I know the purse itself—I had examined it when I had gone to the fishmonger's, just before I went into the Park, and changed a half-sovereign—the person who gave me information is not here.





ROBERT DAVIS
 (police-constable A 212.) I took the prisoner—I saw the tassel of the purse at the bottom of his trowsers—I took it from him—it contained three sovereigns and seven shillings.

Cross-examined. Q. Have you kept it ever since? A. Yes, it was under his trowsers—I examined his trowsers, and I found he could have put it into the pocket, or outside—there were three sovereigns in one end and seven shillings in the other—the prosecutrix told me there was that sum in it—I searched him, in consequence of what she told me.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I live in West Smithfield, and am a silversmith
. On the 7th of December, about half-past two in the morning, I was at a fire on Saffron-hill


; my watch was not hanging out, I was just by one of the engines, the prisoner pulled my watch out, I laid hold of him, and my friend said, he saw him throw the watch away, my friend picked it up. I am sure I saw the prisoner take it.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He was facing me. I am sure of his person.

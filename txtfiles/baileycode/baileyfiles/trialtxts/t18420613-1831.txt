SARAH CASTLE
. I am cook to Mr. Walpole Eyres, of Bryanston-square. The prisoner brought milk to my house for Mr. Filling, his master. On the 14th of May I paid him 1l. 2s. 4d. for his master.





JAMES FILLING
. I am the prisoner's master. It was his duty to pay my housekeeper what money he received—he has not paid me this money.

Cross-examined by
MR. PATNE. Q. You gave him into custody the same day, the 14th? A. Yes, from about half-past six to seven o'clock—I do not know of his having paid monies he had not received—we serve a Mrs. Price—I never bought any ginger-beer or bottles of the prisoner—I have a son living with me—I do not know of his having any bird-cages French-polished.





JANE TRADER

Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him for it? A. No—he came to me about five o'clock—he paid me 11s. 6d. on Mrs. Price's account that day—I understand he has not received it—it was his duty to pay me every day every farthing—he was employed from five in the morning till

half-past six at night—his wages were 17s. a-week—he has a wife, and one child.

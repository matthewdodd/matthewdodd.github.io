 was indicted

William Wightwick.






WILLIAM HOLDICH.
 I am warehouseman to Mr. William Wightwick, of No. 105, Fleet-street. On the evening of the 31st of July I saw the shadow of a man in the shop—I went to the side door, but saw no one—I went out and saw the prisoner walking down Fleet-street with this flannel and counterpane—I went, collared him, and brought him back to the shop—I had seen this property safe in the shop a few minutes before—it is my master's, and is my own marking.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE
Q. Which door was it you saw the shadow of a man at? A. The door in Farringdon-street—we have one door there, and one in Fleet-street—when I saw the prisoner he was about six yards from the door—I will swear he had not got fifty yards off—I followed him, caught him by the collar, and he dropped these goods—he had not got them on his shoulder—they were under his arm, and he threw them down—I did not shake him—I told him to pick the goods up—he would not, and I picked them up—I held him by the collar while I picked up the goods—he did not kick me; he wished me to let him go—he said he was carrying the things for another person—our shop is about forty yards long—we have a lobby before you get into the shop—the door was standing open on account of the weather being warm.




GUILTY.** Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

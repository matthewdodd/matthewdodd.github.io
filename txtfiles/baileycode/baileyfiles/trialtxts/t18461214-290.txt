St. Dunstan-in-the-East, and stealing 2 watch-keys, value 5l.; 20 seals, 15l.; 12 rings, 3l. 10s.; and 1 brooch, 2s.; his goods: and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






HENRY LEACH
. I am in the employ of my father, Richard Leaob, of No. 5, Great Tower-street. On the 4th of Dec, about six o'clock, I was in my shop—a large stone was thrown at the window—I next saw the prisoner's hand inside the window, taking up a tray of jewellery—he took it out of the window, and threw it down on the pavement—it contained twenty seals, twelve rings, and two watch-keys—I did not pick them up myself—the prisoner was secured, and I saw him drop a gold key and a black brooch—he was never out of my sight.





JOHN SUMMERFIELD
 (City police-constable, No. 533.) A few minutes past six o'clock in the evening I was in Thames-street, and heard a cry, and saw the prisoner—I ran after him, and stopped him—he dropped this brooch and key—I took him back to Mr. Leach's shop—in searching him this key dropped from his clothes—I saw Leach take this brooch from his pocket.





JOHN LEWIN
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read Convicted, December, 1844, and confined one year)—the prisoner is the person tried and convicted—it was for robbing the same prosecutor.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Second Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

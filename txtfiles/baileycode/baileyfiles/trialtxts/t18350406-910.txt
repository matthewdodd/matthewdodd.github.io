CHARLES WILLIAM CRECKELER
. I live at Greenwich. On the 13th of March, I was in the shop of Mr. Tidmarsh, on Eyre-street-hill—I left my gig at the door, and my great-coat in it—I saw the prisoner pass two or three times—I saw him go to the gig and take my coat—I ran out—he saw me pursuing him, and threw the coat down—I still followed calling "Stop him"—when he got to the top of the hill, he was stopped—I am sure he is the person.





JAMES TIDMARSH
. I live on Eyre-street-hill. The prosecutor was in my shop that day—I saw him go out—I followed, and saw the coat under the prisoner's arm.





JOHN DIXON
 (police-constable S 167.) I took the prisoner—I did not see the coat in his possession.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw a boy go to the chaise, and take out the coat—he dropped it, I took it up, and the gentleman took me.




GUILTY

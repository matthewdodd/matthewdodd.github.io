            . I am the daughter of John Edwards; he is a shoemaker
, and lives in Bath-street


 - I was there on the 8th of July, and saw the prisoner come to his shop; she asked if we had any second-hand shoes - after being told we did not sell them, she went away; when she was gone, a young woman gave me information - I went out, and saw the prisoner twenty yards or more from my father's house; I went after her to the end of Providence-street - there I saw her stop and take a pair of boots from her pocket-hole, and put them into her apron; I followed her till she came to Worship-street, and then I went into the office, and spoke to a gentleman, who took her with the boots - he was called away, and Eagles took them.

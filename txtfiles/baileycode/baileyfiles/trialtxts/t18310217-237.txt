            . I am eleven years old. I was at home, and the trousers were at our door - a great crowd came - a man came, took down the trousers, and ran into the crowd again; I lost sight of him - I saw the prisoner at the office on Saturday, and I know he is the man who took them - I am quite sure he is the person; I ran, and called Stop thief! but he got into the crowd - I saw his face.

Prisoner's Defence. We went to go to the Admiralty - many of us were without clothes; I picked up the trousers in the crowd.

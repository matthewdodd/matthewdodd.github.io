SAMUEL SMITH. I lived at Mr. Isaac's lodging-house, in West-street, Smithfield; but have been obliged to leave there, in consequence of the prisoner's companions ill-using me - on Sunday, the 1st of June, I went into a cook-shop to get dinner - the prisoner followed me very closely - I felt my handkerchief, slide out of my pocket very gently - I turned to the prisoner, and he threw my handkerchief on the floor - this is it.

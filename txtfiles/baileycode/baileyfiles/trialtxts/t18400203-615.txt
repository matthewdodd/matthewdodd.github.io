JOSEPH LINAN
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of December, 33 handkerchiefs, value 13s., the goods of 



Frederick Thompson Hildreth.


MR. RYLAND
conducted the Prosecution.






FREDERICK THOMPSON MEREDITH
. I am fifteen years old, and am shopboy to Mr. Frederick Thompson Hildreth, a hosier and glover, in Oxford-street On an evening in December, (I cannot say the day of the month,) I was in the shop, between nine and ten o'clock; the prisoner came in and asked for a penny skein of black silk—I told him we did not sell it—in passing out at the door he caught up a bundle of handkerchiefs, and ran off—I immediately pursued him—he ran down Chapel-street, and when he saw me he threw them into a greengrocer's shop—I secured them, and took them to my employer—I did not follow him further.





FREDERICK THOMPSON HILDRETH
. I keep this shop. Meredith gave me the bundle of handkerchiefs—they are my property—I gave them to the officer before the Magistrate—I do not recollect the day of the robbery—it was after Christmas-day—Pocock afterwards brought me a quantity of things, but none of them belonged to me—my boy identified the prisoner at the office—I saw nothing of the transaction—these are the handkerchiefs—(looking at them.)





CHARLES HENRY BAGNEL
 (police-constable F 31.) I received the handkerchiefs from the prosecutor, and have had them ever since.





FREDERICK THOMPSON MEREDITH

re-examined. That is the bundle of handkerchiefs I saw him run away with.

Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchiefs were not delivered to the officer till after I was committed here—I dare say there have been handkerchiefs sold out of the bundle since.

MR. HILDRETH
re-examined. It is very probable some may have been sold out of the bundle since—I know these to be the same, as I have no other bundle like them—I know the handkerchiefs the boy brought back are mine—they are cotton ones.




GUILTY
.* Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years.

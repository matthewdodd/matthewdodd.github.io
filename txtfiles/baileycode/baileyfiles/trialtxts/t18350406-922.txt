 was indicted

for stealing, on the

Robert Gibson.






ROBERT GIBSON
. I live in the Old Bailey. On the 1st of April, I was walking up Fleet-street—I felt something at my pocket—I put my hand into my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I turned and saw the prisoner—I said he had taken my handkerchief—he said he had not—he was close behind me.





ROBERT MASON
 (City police-constable No. 91.) I know the prisoner by sight—I saw him on the 1st of April, about twenty minutes after four o'clock, walking behind this gentleman—I watched him, and saw him draw a redcoloured silk handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and he gave it to another person—I could not get across in time enough to take them both, but I took the prisoner, as the prosecutor was talking to him.

Prisoner. When you came up, you asked the prosecutor what he had lost? Witness. No; I said directly, that I saw you draw the handkerchief.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring his innocence.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

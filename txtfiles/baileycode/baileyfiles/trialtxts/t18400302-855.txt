WILLIAM MINALL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of February, I saw, value 5s.; and 1 rule, value 6d.; the goods of 



Henry Freeman; and 2 saws, value 9s., the goods of 



Charles Brown.






HENRY FREEMAN
. I am a carpenter, and was at work on the 22nd of February in some new buildings, in Warwick-square, Kensington. I left the whole of my tools there on the 22nd, at twelve o'clock, when I went to dinner—they were in the first floor—the front-door was fastened in the usual way—we were absent about an hour—when I returned I missed a saw and a rule—they were afterwards found at the pawnbroker's—these are them—(looking at them.)





JOSEPH HENRY SYMES
. I am assistant to Mr. Wells, a pawnbroker. This saw was pawned by the prisoner.





CHARLES BROWN
. I was at work at the same place as Freeman was—I lost two saws—one of them is that produced by Symes.





GEORGE HAWKINS
. I am a pawnbroker. I have produced a saw pawned by the prisoner.
(Elizabeth Seager, a mangier, in Wood-street, Westminster, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY.* Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

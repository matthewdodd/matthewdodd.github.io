JOHN CURBY. I am a dyer
, and live in Ratcliff-highway. On Monday evening I was in Cannon-street-road


; the prisoner passed me, and drew my watch from me - he crossed the road, and ran up a street; I lost sight of him, as I could not run after him, being lame. I am quite certain of his person. The watch was found upon him.

            . I was in New-street, Cannon-street-road on Monday last; I heard the prosecutor cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner run across the road - I followed close to him, till he was knocked down by a gentleman, who went away after he had given him in charge to a constable; the prisoner's hat fell off or was taken off, and partly in it and partly out of it was this watch and chain; he owned the hat, and said, "Now I will go with you."

            . I live at No. 11, by Oxford Chapel


, I am a washerwoman
, the things mentioned in the indictment are what I had taken into wash; on Saturday night I went up stairs about six o'clock, I staid up stairs about an hour, I came down accidently and found that not only the street door was open, which I believe to be shut, but the parlour door was likewise open, the drawers were open and several things taken away, I received the things again at a public-house, from a gentleman that was there, they have been in my custody ever since, (they were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.

            . I saw the two prisoners come out of this house, No. 11, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, after they came out they joined a sailor, who had a bag upon his back, I know them so as to swear they are the two men, I dodg'd them, I saw the persons put the things they had taken out of the house, into the bag that the sailor had, something dropped at the door, Clayton stopped to take it up, that gave me an opportunity of observing the persons more particularly, I am very positive to the persons of the men when they were put into the bag we called upon a footman who refused to give us any assistance, then we talked of calling for a coachman, and continuing to follow the prisoners, they droped the bag under a dead wall in the street; Berry took the bag up, the things were delivered over to the prosecutrix in the public-house.

            . I saw the two prisoners put the things into the bag the sailor had, and then the footman being called upon, and refusing his assistance on our talking of a coachman the bag was dropped, I did not see it dropped, but Bedo shewed me where it was dropped, I went to the place and took up the bag, we carried it to the public house, they were took out of the bag, and delivered to the prosecutrix.

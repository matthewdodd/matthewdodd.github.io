            . I live in Chambers's street, Goodman's-fields



; I lett a ready furnished lodging to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bracket 
               



            ; she left her lodging on the 20th of September, at which time I missed two blankets and two sheets out of her room; I was informed Bracket, and Manning the mother, had been and sold a sheet to a woman; I went, and desired if they came again to stop them; after which I was sent for; I went to Justice Scott and got a warrant, and took them in custody; then Bracket told me that Manning the younger had assisted her; I remember she had come to my house, and asked for my lodger; Bracket said she had wound one of my sheets round Manning's body, and then they went away to a dark passage in Rosemary-lane, and there took it off; I found her mother, and Bracket had sold one sheet, after that the young one owned she had pawned the two blankets in Bracket's name, but when I came to the pawnbroker I found they were pawned in her own name (one sheet and two blankets produced and deposed to.)

                  Miller

                  Mary 
                  Bracket 
               



             brought this sheet, and Manning the mother was with her; they sold it to my wife, and as soon as I found it was the prosecutor's property I delivered it up.


                  Bridget 
                  Miller 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker; Manning the younger pledged the two blankets to me in her own name.
Bracket's defence.
I intended to bring them in again, and they intoxicated me with liquor, that I did not know what I did.
Manning the mother's defence.
Bracket came to my lodgings, and asked for my daughter; she said she wanted a little money against Monday morning, and wanted to know where she could pawn the things; I carried the sheet to Mrs. Miller's, and got 18 d. upon it; she told me it was her own.
The daughter's defence.
Bracket came to me; I did not know but the things were her own.

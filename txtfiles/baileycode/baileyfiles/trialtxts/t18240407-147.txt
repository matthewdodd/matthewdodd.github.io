            . I am an upholdsterer
. On the 19th of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Park-lane


, and saw the prisoners there. They passed me, and a gentleman said my pocket was picked. I felt, and missed my handkerchief. I immediately went up to them, and saw Moore give it to Short from his bosom. I secured them both.

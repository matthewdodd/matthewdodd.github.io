            . The prisoner at the bar was my servant
, I am the master of Tottle fields bridewell
  . On or about the 8th of this instant I came down stairs in the morning, there was a fire made, but the girl was gone. She not returning, I supposed she had taken something away. We look'd and miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment. After I had taken her up, she confess'd the fact and went with me to the people where she had pawn'd and sold them. She had broke the tongs to pieces. The goods were produced in court, and deposed to.

            . I am a gold-smith. On the 8th of February the prisoner at the bar came to my shop, and brought the tea-tongs broke in pieces, and said she found it. I bought it of her. She then told me she liv'd with one Mr. Atkinson, a bookseller, near the Gatehouse.

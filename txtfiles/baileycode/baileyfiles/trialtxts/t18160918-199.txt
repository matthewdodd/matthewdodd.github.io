                  , from his person
            .
THOMAS TAPLING. The prisoner came up to me, and laid hold of me; she said she wanted some gin. I felt something come from my pocket, which was the prisoners hand. I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my money; I immediately caught hold of the prisoner, and said, you have robbed me; I immediately took hold of her hand, and some of the money was in it, and the rest she let fall. I immediately called out for the assistance of an officer.

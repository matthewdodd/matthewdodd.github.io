JAMES KENDALL
. I live in Upper Ogle-street, Marylebone. On the 20th of July, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, my apartment was entered while I was asleep, and a coat, handkerchief, latch-key, and pocket-knife stolen—it did not appear how the persons got in or out—the door was left open—I occupy the two parlours, and sleep in the back—my brother slept in the front, from which the things were taken—this knife is mine—(looking at it)—I positively swear to it—the coat has not been found

—I firmly believe this latch-key to be mine—it was in the pocket of the coat.





CHARLES ROBERTS
. I am a policeman. I found these articles on the prisoner, at the station-house—I saw him throw the key away in Blenheim-street.

Prisoner's Defence, I know nothing about it.

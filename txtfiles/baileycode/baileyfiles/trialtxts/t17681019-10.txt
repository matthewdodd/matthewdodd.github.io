            . I did keep the Two Brewers, a public house in Long ditch, Westminster





, at the time this money was lost; on February 22, about 11 o'clock, I sent my maid up to make the bed; she came down stairs, and said the door was broke open; I and some others that were in my house wentup and found the lock of the door lying on the floor, and a chissel by it, a trunk of mine in the middle of the room turned upside down; then I went into the closet, and missed the club-box, which was always kept with the greatest safety, in which was money, a witness here will inform the court what money; I had one key to it, and each of the stewards another: I could not tell who it could be, if not one of my servants that had lived with me; we went to a house where was a maid that had lived with me about three weeks before, we found some odd things of mine; I took her up, and a man that went for her husband, named Collins; Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             committed him to the Gatehouse, and her to Tothill-fields Bridewell; after they had been there four days, he sent word to her to desire she would confess, if she knew any thing of it; upon that she sent me word to come to her, and take her to Sir John's, she would tell the truth; there she said the prisoner stole the money, and she received part of the money, and that he belonged to the guards; the next morning, when the company was upon duty, the serjeant told us Curtis had heard we were after him, and he was gone off; the Colonel did not advertise him as a deserter; then I tried the woman here, it appearing she did not steal the box and money, she was acquitted (See No 286 it this Mayoralty;) the prisoner was taken up at Uxbridge for another robbery, and brought before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; Sir John said, you are the Curtis the soldier that robbed the man at the Two Brewers; I went and took Collins there, and she gave information of the fact; when Sir John asked her how much she had of the money, the prisoner answered she had ten guineas of it, and that it was along of her that he committed the robbery; the club-box was found in the Thames by a waterman, and brought home to me with a bond, and some papers belonging to the club in it.
Q. Did the prisoner belong to the club?
Jackson. No, he did not.


                  Richard 
                  Beckford 
               



            . I am clerk to the club, I kept an account of the box, there was in it 55 l. and upwards, in gold, silver, and copper; I know there were forty guineas, and one 18 s. piece, I cannot particularly speak to the number of small pieces; I heard the prisoner say at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, he had given 
               
                  Collins
               


             the evidence here ten guineas and a half of the money; he laid it all to her, as being the cause of his doing it.
Q. What were his words?
Beckford. He said to her, you deserve my fate, you are more accessary in the robbery; she was a servant in the house, and could inform him where the box stood.


                  Sarah 
                  Collins 
               



            . I was servant with Mr. Jackson, and had left him about three weeks before the box was stolen; I was with the prisoner, and we were talking about clubs; the prisoner had asked my husband, 
               
                  William 
                  Collins 
               



            , to go to a club; my husband could not go, for he had spent all his money last week; I said, there is a club where I did live; said he, I'll warrant you there is a good booty in that box, whereabouts does it stand; I said, it is in my master's room, that is all the intelligence I gave him; after that I met him in Tothill-street, with a brown box under his coat; he went into Tothill-fields, and broke it open, and took the money out, as he told me; he came into my room, and gave me ten guineas and a half out of a piece of brown canvass, and said he was going away directly; one of the pieces that he thought to be a guinea was an 18 s. piece; he then said, I wish you very well, I'll set off directly.
Q. Did he tell you how much money he had got?
S. Collins. No, he did not, I saw it was gold in a brown purse.
Prosecutor. The box was brought to me by a waterman that lives by Millbank, it was found near there.


                  William 
                  Moore 
               



            . I live at the Six Bells at Uxbridge. On the 25th of February last the prisoner was recommended to my house in a returned post-chaise, he wanted to lie there all night; then he said he would not, but would go to Oxford, he was very fuddled; I saw he had a great deal of money, gold and silver all together, he told it out, and I gave him a paper of the number of pieces which he delivered to me, twenty-one guineas in guineas and half guineas, two 6 s. 9 d. pieces, one 9 s. piece, and one 5 s. 3 d. piece; after that he altered his mind, and said he would have a post-chaise in order to go to Oxford; I then sent to the same house where he was recommended from for a post-chaise; then I ordered my wife to fetch down the money again; after I had told it down he said it was very dangerous to travel with so much money, he left twenty-one guineas with me, and I gave him a note of hand for it; he went away, and came the next day and demanded the money without the note, I did not chuse to deliver it without the note; he lay at my house that night, and the next morning went out and came with the note, then the money was paid him; he sent for a woman that lived in the town, that he he said was a relation of his, and gave her a guinea and five shillings.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the box, I never was in the house except when with

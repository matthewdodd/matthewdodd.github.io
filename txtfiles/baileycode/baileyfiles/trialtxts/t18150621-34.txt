            . I am a linen draper
. I reside in Judd-street. I lost this calico on the 17th of this month, between three and four in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner at the bar take it; it was hanging at the door; there were eighteen yards, I immediately pursued him, and never lost sight of him, until he was taken.

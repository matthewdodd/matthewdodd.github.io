WILLIAM THOMAS WHITE
. On the 2nd of February I was in Leaden-hall market, between seven and eight o'clock, and observed the prisoner take the beef off the board of Mr. Garnham's shop, put it on his shoulder, and go away with it—I gave information, and went in pursuit of the prisoner—he had got about two or three hundred yards—he had got the beef, and I took him.





JOHN FRANKS
. I live with Jesse Garnham, a butcher in Leadenhall market—White gave me information, and I went with him in pursuit of the prisoner—I found him with the beef—there is seventy pounds—it is my master's—I had cut it from the hind quarter, and put it on the board myself—I do not know the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. A man asked me to carry it for him out of the market, which I did, and these men came and took it.

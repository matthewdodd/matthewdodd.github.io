GEORGE SMITH
 was again indicted

 for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



Peter Clark Blount, and stealing 25 yards of carpet, value 5l.; his property.






SOPHIA DICKER
. I am in the service of Peter Clark Blount, of 5, Highbury-place—it is his dwelling-house. On the Wednesday before I went before the Magistrate, I went to bed at eleven o'clock—the cook went just before me—I left the house all fastened—some carpet was lying on a box under the store-room window, to which there were four iron bars; I put it there—there is a communication from that room into the kitchen—a person could draw anything out through the bars from the outside—I came down next morning at a quarter-past six, went into the knife-house in the yard, and there found two of the pieces of carpet—I then went and found the store-room window partly open, and missed four pieces of carpet—I have seen them since—these produced are them—I know them by the binding—they are Mr. Blount's property.





THOMAS HUGHES
. The prisoner pledged these carpets with us on

Thursday, 9th May—we lent him 8s.—he came again on the Saturday, and I gave the carpet to the policeman.





HENRY GILLETT
 (policeman, N 383). On the Saturday I was talking to Mr. Hughes outside the shop—the prisoner saw me run, and I caught him, and told him I wanted him about the carpet—he said he would come—I searched him, and found three prayer-books, a wax candle, a box of lucifers, three knives, and a comb on him—Mr. Blount's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington.

Prisoner's Defence. I always carry the match-box to light my pipe with.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

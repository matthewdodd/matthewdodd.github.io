HENRY BINFIELD



, stealing 2 memorandum-books, 2 locks, 3 keys, and 1 scent-bottle, value 7s.; the goods of 



Thomas John Smith and another, his masters: and 





HENRY HALL



, feloniously receiving the same; to which 
BINFIELD pleaded 


GUILTY
. Aged 17.—



Confined Seven Days.

(He received an excellent character. His father engaged to look after him, and two witnesses engaged to give him employment.)





JOSEPH HEDINGTON
 (City-policeman, 20). In consequence of information, I watched Mr. Smith's premises, in Queen-street, on 2nd May, at a quarter to eleven o'clock—I saw Binfield there, and followed him to the corner of St. Andrew's-hill, where he joined Hall—they went together to the corner of Ireland-yard—I saw Binfield take something from his waistcoat-pocket, and give it to Hall; then something else, which Hall put into his jacket-pocket—they then separated—I followed Hall, took him, and found two books in his pocket; I asked him where he got them—he said he bought them of a boy—I took him to the station, and then found the locks—he said he bought them of the same boy—I had been watching Binfield nearly a week, and on the previous Saturday I saw both the prisoners meet in Basing-lane—Binfield gave Hall something, which I believe was money—on the following Monday also they were together about twenty minutes.





GEORGE THOMAS BOOTH
. I am in Mr. Smith's employment. We have locks like these produced, in our warehouse—I cannot swear to them, but they correspond in every particular—I believe these memorandum-books to be Mr. Smith's property—there is so much property in the shop, that we should not miss such a small quantity.

Halll's Defence. Binfield asked me if I wanted to buy any locks; I asked what sort; he said he would bring them; he brought them, and said he wanted 3s. for them; I said I had not got the money.

HALL—


GUILTY
. Aged 22.**†—


Transported for Seven Years.

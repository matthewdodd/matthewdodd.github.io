, and lives in Shoreditch


. On the 28th of June the prisoners came together for half a yard of fringe - I said we did not sell it - they then asked to try on some boots, but they did not fit them - Roberts asked to look at them - Johnson then went away, but Roberts remained - Mr. Hanley then came in, and asked me to search Roberts, which I did - I found one pair of shoes on her - they had no money about them.

            . On Saturday week the prisoners came to the shop, and were looking at some boots and shoes - I went to the door, and saw Johnson come to the door, and call out, "Sall, Sall" - she then ran across the street, and down a court - I pursued her, but was stopped by three men - one collared me, and another pushed me back - I went back to the shop, and desired the officer to go in.(Roberts received a good character.)

            , a bookseller
, in Bridge-court, Westminster


. I was playing with the baby in the shop, on the 10th of May, and saw the prisoner come and take two books up - he put them in his coat, buttoned it, and got three yards from the shop with them; I called after him - he brought them back, threw them down on the stall, and went off; I ran after him, and a butcher stopped him; he struck the butcher, and a Policeman came and took him; these are the books - I thought he had some more books, as he had a bag with him; when the Policeman took him he struck me in the face.
Prisoner. I did not take them away from the window. Witness. Yes, you had got three yards when I called you.
EDWARD HOWARD. I was passing the shop, and saw the prisoner with a wisp of straw, which I thought he was dusting the books with - I passed by him, and he was called back; I afterwards saw him taken, and he struck the boy with his fist.
Prisoner's Defence. I put the books down, and the boy followed me, and said I had stolen them - I gave him a slap of the face for telling a lie.

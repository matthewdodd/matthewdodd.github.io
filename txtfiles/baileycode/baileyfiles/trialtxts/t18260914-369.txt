            . I am a carrier. On the evening of the 14th of September Mr. Mould's man delivered me three tubs of butter; I tied two behind my cart, and put the other inside; I stopped in Lisle-street


, and saw it all safe, but before I got to the end of the street my cart seemed lighter - I got down, and the two tubs were gone; the rope had been cut; I ran, and met a man, who gave me information - and in Leicester-square I saw the prisoner running, with a tub on his shoulder; I stopped him; he said he got it from a gentleman's door, in Lisle-street; this was within two minutes of my missing it.

            . I received him in charge, and found a knife on him, with a direction, which had been on the tub. The knife had a piece of the rope on it.

MART MARDLE
. I live with my mother at a chandler's-shop in Clare-street, Cambridge-road. On the afternoon of the 18th of October I was in a parlour adjoining the shop, and saw the prisoner leaning over the counter, with his hand in the till—I and my mother followed him into the street—he got away—I examined the till, and missed quite 1l.'s worth of silver—I had noticed in the till, not half-an-hour before, three half-crowns, and twelve shillings or more—on the same afternoon I saw the prisoner in the street, and gave an alarm—he ran up Patriarch-square, jumped into the cemetery, and was stopped by Hallum—I noticed that he had a' straw hat on in the shop, with a piece of black tape round it, and it was trimmed with the same—he had the same hat on when I saw him.





FRANCBS MARDLE
. I am the wife of Benjamin Mardle. I saw the prisoner at the counter, with his hands in the till—he escaped—I have no doubt of his being the man—I had three half-crowns and some shillings, which were gone from the till.





JOHN BLAKE
. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Mile end-road, and saw the prisoner and Hallums, the constable, by the Globe-road, a short distance from the cemetery, between three and four o'clock, charged with robbing a till—he was taken to the station—I found two half-crowns, thirteen shillings and a sixpence on him—he could not give any account of it—he had a white straw hat with tape round it.

Prisoner's Defence. Coming down Hackney-road, I saw a mob running; some one said, "There he goes," and they took me.

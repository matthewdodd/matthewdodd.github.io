            . I am clerk
 to Mr. Brown, Proctor of Doctor's Commons. I lost my seal on the 14th of July, it was attached to my watch by a black ribbon: I had been in the pit of the Royalty Theatre


, and was waiting in the avenue for my father to come out; I observed my ribbon blowing about by the wind, and at first, I thought my watch was gone, but upon further examination, I found it was not, but the ribbon had been cut. I had observed the prisoner very near me in the pit. I stoppedhim as he was going out, and saw him throw the seal from his left hand.

JOHN LINDEMAN. I am a sugar-baker
, and live in Whitechapel. On the 27th of December I met the prisoner in Dock-street - I went to a house, and went to bed with her - my watch was then in my fob - I put my trousers in a chair; when I awoke between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was gone with my watch; this is the watch - I can swear to it; I gave her some money, but did not give her the watch.
JAMES FOGG. I am an officer. The landlady of the house, No. 6, Dock-street


, told me that the man had lost his watch; I went with her to a house in Rosemary-lane, and found the prisoner with three or four men, drinking - the prosecutor said "That is the girl;" I said, "Where is the man's watch?" she said, "I don't know. I never saw the man;" I said, "You slept with him last night" - she denied it; I then searched her, and found this watch wrapped up in a handkerchief in her bosom; she then said some woman gave it to her.
ELIZABETH CRISPIN. This man and woman came to my house and had the lodging - the man paid 1s. for it; I afterwards found the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. He gave it me at seven o'clock on Saturday night, and told me to pawn it - he said he had no money; I said I would not, as he was drunk, and might make away with the duplicate; he might come on Monday and have it.

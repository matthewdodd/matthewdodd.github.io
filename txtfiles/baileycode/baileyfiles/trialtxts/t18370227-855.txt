CAROL INK DAVIS
. I am the wife of William Davis, of George Inn-passage, Snowhill. The prisoner came to lodge there—he said he was a tailor, and his cousin lived next door—these boots are my husband's and the other things are my son's, who is nineteen years old.





WILLIAM DAVIS, JUN
. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 18th of February I had four half-crowns and sixteen shillings, and an apron and shirt, in the room up stairs, where the prisoner slept that night along with me—he got up the next morning between five and six o'clock—I missed him, and got up—I got a light, and missed this money from my trowsers

pocket, and then missed these other things—the prisoner had come to lodge there for a constancy, but he did not return after that morning—this apron is mine—he was taken in St. Dunstan's church on the following Sunday evening—no one else had an opportunity of taking these things—there was only my brother and an old man who slept in the room beside us.





THOMAS LIGHTFOOT
. I took the prisoner, and found this apron on him. He said his name was Smith, not Preston, which was the name he went by at the prosecutor's house.




GUILTY
.†Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

GEORGE CROFT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
10th of September, 1 1/2 bushel of wheat in the chaff, value 10s.; and 6 sacks, value 4s.; the goods of 



Richard Booth Smith, his master; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD BOOTH SMITH
. I live at Huxter Farm, Edmonton. The prisoner was my labourer for about half a year, but I have known him a number of years—I received information from the police-sergeant, on the 10th of September, that he had found a quantity of wheat and a sack of mine in the prisoner's lodgings—I could not miss the wheat out of the bulk—the prisoner had been threshing wheat, and I believe the wheat found to be mine—these sacks are mine—he had no right to have possession of them—my wheat had been in an old barn at a distance—the prisoner and another were threshing there.





JAMES HARRISON
 (police-sergeant N 32.) I went from information to the prisoner's lodging—I found this sack there, with about a bushel and a half of wheat in the chaff in it—the other officer found these other sacks there.





JOHN WILLIAM BOYD
 (police-constable N 351.) I found these other sacks in the prisoner's lodging.

MR. SMITH
re-examined. These sacks are all mine—I never allow my men to take sacks home, unless they ask for a bushel of wheat or some potatoes, and then they may take a sack if they return it the next morning—I never allow my men to sell oat chaff.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about the wheat; there was another man threshing there, and he could not say that I took the wheat out of the barn.





JAMES FIELD
. I am a shoemaker. I produce a certificate of the pri-soner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I belong to the Humane Society. I was coming down Greek-street, about half-past seven o'clock, and saw two men at Ware's door, which was shut. I saw the prisoner open it and go in - two more remained watching, he pushed a butter-tray along the counter, and came out, went in again, reached over the counter, and came out with the till; and all three ran away. I followed, he threw it down, and I caught him directly - it contained 36 s. 4 1/2 d.

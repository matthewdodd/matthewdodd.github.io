The Prisoners deny'd the Fact, and call'd Persons to their Reputation. Several appear'd for Hutchinson, who gave him a good Character, as an Honest Man, and one who constantly frequented the Church. Others appear'd to Mr. Atkin's Character, who also gave him the Character of an Honest Man; and one depos'd. He had known him stop stolen Goods, for the use of the right Owners, and had heard him charge his Daughter, in his Absence to take Care not to buy any such. But in Contradiction to this, one Evidence appear'd, who said, He had in the Year 1714, prosecuted him for a Fact of the like Nature. The Jury found 


               them Guilty to the Value of 39 s

Hutchinson pleaded, That Mr. Rawlins had made him drunk, and he know not what he did when he gave the Information.

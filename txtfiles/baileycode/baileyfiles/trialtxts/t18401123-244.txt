. was indicted

 for stealing, on the

WILLIAM OSMOND
. I am in the service of Mr. Isaac Crocker, a cheesemonger, in Beckford-row, Walworth. Between five and six o'clock last Monday I received information from Mr. Churcher—I went out, ran across the street, and up another street—I then heard something fall—I looked, and picked up this cheese on the right-hand side—the prisoner was brought back to me on the left-hand side—this is the cheese—here is 20lbs. of it—it had been in my master's shop a little time before.





GEORGE CHURCHER
. I live next door to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner take the cheese from the show-board outside—I went and informed the shopman—he went after the prisoner—I am sure he is the person.

Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. Inside my shop—there was a glass between you and I.





GEORGE HENRY KIBBL
. (police-constable P 168.) I was called to the prosecutor's shop, and heard the prisoner begging for Mr. Crocker to let him off—he ran out of the shop—I pursued and caught him.





CHARLES BURGESS GOF
. (police-sergeant L 81.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried by the name of John Williams.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

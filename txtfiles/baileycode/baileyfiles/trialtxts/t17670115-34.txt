. On the 24th of December, between five and six in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop to buy a pair of silk stockings; he first wanted to see coloured ones, then some white ones, then the coloured ones again; he bought a pair at 14 s. he gave me a guinea to charge; while he was looking out the guinea, I folded up the pair he bought in a bit of paper, and laid them on the counter; while I was feeling in my pocket for the change, he went to the place where I laid the coloured ones; he turned his backside to the edge of the counter, and put his hand behind him, and took a pair of stockings from the counter; I saw his hand, and saw the stockings move; I was so fluttered, I had not power to count the change at first; he approached two or three steps forward to take the change; I gave it him; he counted it, and said it was right; I took the stockings that he had purchased, and jumped over the counter, and said, Sir, I'll see what you have about you of my property, you have robbed me; she said I might search him, if I found any thing I was welcome to take it; he unbuttoned his great coat, and down sell the stockings; I took them up, and sent my apprentice for a constable, and took him before Justice Fielding; (the stockings produced and deposed to.) I delivered his stockings to him before Sir

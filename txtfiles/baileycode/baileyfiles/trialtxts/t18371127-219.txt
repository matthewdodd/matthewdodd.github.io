WILLIAM RICE, alias
 Tidy,

 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of October, 1 mare, price 16l., the property of 




James Batchelor.






JAMES BATCHELOR
. I am a farmer, and live at Worth, in Sussex. On saturday morning, the 27th of October, about half-past nine o'clock, I turned my mare out into the field—next morning, between eight and nine I found the gate open, and tracked the mare out into the road—I found her afterwards in Pring's custody on the 14th of November—it cost 16l.





WILLIAM LOW
. I live at Kennington Common. On the 28th of October I saw a mare in possession of the prisoner, who I never saw before—he asked if I knew the name of Hussey—I went with him to Hussey—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I afterwards saw the same horse in Pring's possession.





WILLIAM CARNOCK
. On the 1st of November I bought a mare of Hussey, senior, for 3l. 10s.—Batchelor claimed her on the 14th of November.





JOHN PRING
. I am an officer. I went to Carnock's house, and found a brown mare, which the prosecutor claimed—Hussey, senior, is very ill, and unable to attend.

MR. FIELDWICK. The prisoner lives at Worth, about two miles from Batchelor.




GUILTY
.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Park.

                  Robert
                   White
               



             was the person who had robbed me; when he came to work next morning I charged him with it. I took him into the kitchen, there he went down on his knees and said, he would tell me what he had done. I bid him get up, for I would hear nothing he said; he got up and said his daughter came to him in great distress, and he gave her the tammies to pawn, and she was to redeem them when she could raise the money; he begged I would show him mercy; I told him I would shew him none, the law must take its course, then I took him before the justice, there he confessed he stole three pieces.
Q. Were there any threats, or promises made use of to induce him to confess?
Arkley. There were none that I know of.

            , I often saw goods in her custody which I thought belonged to Mr. Arkley.
Q. Is she your wife?
Orton. No. I saw two pieces of tammies in her custody about a fortnight ago. I told Mr. Arkley; she said they were Mr. Arkley's; that she had them of her father and was going to pledge thems

1919. 




THOMAS THOMAS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of August, 1 jacket, value 15s.; 1 waistcoat, value 2s.; and 1 cap, value 6d.; the goods of 



Richard Williams: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN WATERS
 (police-constable N 116.) On Wednesday night, the 12th of August, I heard a cry of, "Thieves at the top of Mr. Williams's house," in Mill-lane—I went up and found the prisoner stowed away in a hop-bin—he had this cap in the bin, which he claimed for his own, but it was claimed by Mr. Williams—these other things were found on the top of the house.





MORRIS WILLIAMS
. I found the jacket and waistcoat on the top of the leads—I did not see the prisoner.





ANN PATERSON
. I am a servant in the house. This property is Mr. Richard Williams's—I had removed these things out of one room, and put them in the lobby—some one took them to the roof of the house.





THOMAS PROSSER
 (police-constable M 128.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—he is the same man.




GUILTY
. Aged 55.—


Transported for Seven Years.

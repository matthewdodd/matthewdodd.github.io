GEORGE BIRD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of December, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Thomas Sheen, from his person.






THOMAS SHEEN
. I am an ironmonger, and live on Holborn-hill. On Sunday night, the 2nd of December, a little after nine o'clock, I was walking by the corner of Field-lane—I felt something at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner walking away with my handkerchief—he dropped it; and three girls who were standing there, directly passed it, one behind the other—the prisoner ran off down Field-lane—I pursued him, but was stopped by two thieves—I came back, went home, disguised myself, went out, and saw the prisoner drinking with some thieves—he then went and sounded several persons' pockets—he then tried a gentleman's pocket, and I laid hold of him—I am quite sure he is the boy—when I took him, he bit my hand—there was an attempt at rescue—I got two good knocks on the head, and I have been threatened since—I had seen the prisoner before.





JOHN FAIR
. I am a watchman. I saw a crowd that night near Halborn-bridge—I saw the prosecutor surrounded by a great number of people—I came up and took hold of the prisoner—I was surrounded by half-a-dozen prostitutes—one gave me a violent blow on the eye, and gave me a black eye—she got a month's imprisonment for it—the prisoner

made a most violent attempt to run away, but by the exertions of the prosecutor we got him to the watch-house.





JAMES SLATE
. I am on officer—I was on duty when the prisoner was brought in, with a woman of the town—there was no handkerchief produce—the prisoner struck me on the head, and knocked my hat off.

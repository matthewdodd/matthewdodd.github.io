            . I am a watchman of Leadenhall-market


. I had seven flats of butter put under my care for Mr. Batten. At half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 5th of February, I saw the prisoner take one of them, I thought he was Mr. Dean's man; when I came to deliver the butter, I found one short. I had seen the prisoner before that time. I am sure he is the man.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner in Dorset-street, about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, with the butter on his shoulder; I asked him what it was; he said, poultry, from Leadenhall-market - I took him. When we got to the door of the watch-house, he threw it at me and sprained my wrist, and got away. I sprung my rattle, and described him to Hughes, and he took him. I am sure the prisoner is the man.

            . The prisoner was described to me. I remembered seeing him pass me, about half-past six o'clock - I took him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

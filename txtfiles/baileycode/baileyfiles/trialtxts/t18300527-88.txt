            . I was in Crawford-street


 on the 26th of April, and saw the prisoner carrying away a carpet from the prosecutor's, on his shoulder; he was about two yards from the house - I did not see him come out of the house; I gave him in charge of an officer at the end of the mews - he said he was desired to carry it some where; I desired him to take it back to where he had taken it from, that I might know where it came from.

            . I live with Charles Brayne, who is a broker
. This carpet was at his door; I had seen the prisoner standing about that day.

            . I am an officer, and produce the carpet.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from work that evening; and a man asked me to carry it for him, and he would give me 2d. or 3 1/2d.; it was not likely I could run with that carpet.

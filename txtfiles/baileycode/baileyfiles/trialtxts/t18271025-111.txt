SAMUEL HARRISON. About six o'clock in the evening of the 25th of September, my wife called me, and said a muslin collar had been taken out of my window with a wire; I ran out, and saw the prisoner walking away with it- as soon as he saw me, he ran; I pursued, and fell down; he threw the collar behind him, and was taken by the street-keeper - it was drawn through a hole, which is made to fasten the shutters.

            . The prisoner was stopped in Charlotte-street; I ran up, and took him; the prosecutor came up, and said, "He has robbed me:" I took him to the watch-house, and in his hat I found these three wires, and this duplicate.

            . I was with Sipless; I found this large gimblet, this file, and penknife, in his pocket.

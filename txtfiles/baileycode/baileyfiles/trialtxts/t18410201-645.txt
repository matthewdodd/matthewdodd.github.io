MATTHIAS WILLIAM CUNDALE
. I am a chemist, and live at No. 12, Great Chapel-street, Westminster; I am single, and live by myself. I first saw the prisoner Fletcher on Friday, the 27th of November—between seven and eight o'clock that evening, I was looking in at a picture-shop in the Strand, at the corner of Southampton-street, and somebody pushed against me—I moved to the other window, and felt the push again from somebody, I did not know who—I did not see Fletcher there—I then went into the City, and on my return home about ten o'clock, through Spring

Gardens, Fletcher tapped me on the shoulder and demanded 1s., and said if I did not give it him he would instantly charge me with an attempt to commit an unnatural crime—being frightened I gave him the shilling—I did not say any thing—he said before I gave it him, that he wanted it to ride home with to a lady that he lived in the Regent's Park with—he said nothing more after he got it—on Sunday night, the 29th of December, between ten and eleven, I met the two prisoners together in Pall Mall—Fletchersaid, "You are just the chap we want," and then they both asked for something to drink, Fletcher first, and Chittem afterwards, and Chittem said if I did not give it them they should press the charge that Fletcher had persevered in on the Friday, and under the fear and dread of being accused of such a crime, I gave them drink—first of all I tried to take shelter from them by going into a public-house in Duke-street, they came in after me, and after we had got into the parlour they ordered a pot of half-and-half, a glass of rum and water, and two cigars—they left the house first—I staid behind and paid 1s. for the articles—it came to 1s. 4d., but I had no more money in my pocket, and could not pay the demand for the cigars—when I went out I saw nothing of them till I had got across the Park in my way home—when I got into James-street, near Buckingham-gate, Fletcher accosted me and said he wanted 1s.—he said he was Lord—'s servant, that he was locked out from the barracks, and if be did not have the 1s. he should press the charge against me still—(Chittemwas with him then)—I told him I had no money with me, that if be wanted any he must come round to where I lived—they walked round James-street into Little Chapel-street—Fletcher remained behind there, and Chittem came round to the door—I opened the door and went into my house—I went round the counter, got 1s. 4d. out of the till, and came round with the intention, if I saw a policeman, of giving them in charge—Idid not see one, and gave Chittem the money—he said nothing, but went away—Fletcher was then in Little Chapel-street, not within sight or hearing—on the 13th of December Fletcher came to my house by himself, and said he wanted 2s.—I gave him the 2s., and when he had got the 2s. he said it was 5s. that he wanted, and not 2s.—I gave him three more shillings, and he went away—on Saturday, the 19th, between nine and ten at night, I was proceeding up Strutton Ground, Westminster, and saw the two prisoners—Itried to avoid them by going down Artillery-place, and round into Little Chapel-street home, but when I got into Little Chapel-street Fletcher first of all came up—he called Chittem by the name of Jem, who then came up, and when they were both together, Fletcher said he wanted a sovereign—I told him I had not got any money—he said he must have it, and if I did not give it him, he would go round to every neighbour in the place and tell them that I was such and such a character—upon that, through the fright and fear of being accused of such a thing as that, I went over to a neighbour, very nearly opposite, and borrowed a sovereign—he lent me a half-sovereign, two half crowns, and the remainder in shillings—Ihad first of all been to my own house, but had not the money—I gave the money to Fletcher in Chittem's sight—Chittem directly said that he wanted a sovereign, for he had had an accident to break the window of his master's carriage, and he must have it—I told him that I had not got it—he said he would press the charge, he would go round as Fletcher bad said and tell the neighbours I was such and such a character—I then went down to a friend of mine in Tothill-street, and borrowed another sovereign—they followed

me—on getting the sovereign I gave it to Chittem, and told him if ever they came down again I should instantly give them in charge, but that was not in Fletcher's hearing—I saw them again on Thursday, the 24th of December, as I was in my shop—they waited about half an hour before any notice was taken of them—I then told my father of what had taken place, and asked him instantly to go out and speak to them—he went out and spoke to Fletcher—I saw him, but did not hear what he said—myfather came in and told me something—they both waited about an hour after that before they went away—I suppose they went because they were tired of waiting any longer—on Monday morning, the 11th of January, the prisoner Fletcher came to my house about eleven—he was very abusive and used a great number of bad words—he said that I was a s—, and that he would not go away from the place till he had given me in charge—I told him he had better go about his business, if he did not I would most assuredly give him in charge—he still staid—I sent a girl that was cleaning for me in the house, through the premises of a next door neighbour, to fetch a policeman—she came back and said she could not find one—a friend then went out, saw a policeman, and brought him in—Fletcher pushed open the door, rushed into the parlour, and there he staid bullying and abusing me till the policeman came—I gave him in charge to the policeman—Chittemwas not there then—he was taken up the same afternoon, and was brought to Queen-square between four and five—I did not order him to be taken, but Mr. Burrell, the Magistrate, did—I had never seen either of the prisoners before this occurrence.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-seven—I am in business for myself, in Great Chapel-street, and shall have been so twelve months next March—I have occasionally gone about town by myself, but not a great deal—I have been with my father and friends—for the last twelve months I have been keeping company with a lady, and when I have gone out I have gone out with her—I was born and bred in London, but from fifteen or eighteen years of age I have lived a little way out of town—the station and police-office are very near my house—the first time I saw Fletcher was on the 27th of November—I had gone into the City on business that evening, a friend had sent for me—itwas between seven and eight o'clock that I was at the picture-shop—I was two or three minutes at each window—one window is in Southampton-street, and the other in the Strand—I felt a push there, but did not see Fletcher then, not till I returned from the City—I saw him at the corner of Spring-gardens, by Drummond's the banker's—it was there he touched me on the shoulder—I went home by the Horse-guards, up King-street, Charles-street, and Delahay-street—I did not go through the enclosure, or into the Park at all—when I saw the two prisoners in Pall-mall, on the 29th, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I had been with two friends part of the way into the City—after coming out of church they went home, and had a bit of supper with me, and after supper I accompanied them as far as Hungerford-market, or rather better.

Q. How was it you found yourself in Pall-mall, from the Strand—that was not in your way home? A. I had been in an ill state of health for some time, and had not been out, except on Friday, for the last eight or nine months, and I thought a little variation in the walk, as it was not very late, would not hurt me, and I proceeded down Pall-mall, instead of the old way—the public-house I went to is at the corner of Duke-street and

Jermyn-street—I do not know the sign—I had been there before, but not for the last two or three years—if I wanted a drop of ale or any thing as I passed, I used to go in—I did not know the landlord or landlady—I suppose I was not half an hour in the public-house with the prisoners—I should say it was not more than half-past ten o'clock when I got there—I went into the parlour first, and they followed me in—there was one gentleman in one of the boxes, nobody else—there was no waiter—I think the person that was in the box brought the drink—I presume he was the landlord—the prisoners and I all sat in one box—I went into the box first, Fletcher followed me on one side, and Chittem afterwards—he sat on the same side of the table as me—I sat in the corner, and he rather higher up, and Fletcher was on the other aide—we had a pot of half-and-half first—the prisoners drank of it, I did not touch a drop of it—I bad a little of the rum-and-water, which came in afterwards—the prisoners ordered it—I took a drop of it—they would not let me go away from the place—after the person waited on us he still staid in the same place—he did not sit down with us—he was in the room all the time till within, I think, about five minutes of starting—he brought in the rum-and-water—Ipassed the bar as I went into the public-house—I did not notice any body there—I walked straight in—I will swear I was not there an hour—Idid not take particular notice of the time, but it was, as near as I could judge, half an hour—they left about five minutes before me—I staid a little while after they went, thinking I should not see them—after they had gone out I went to the end of Jermyn-street, down St. James's-street, and through St. James's-park—if I had gone the other way I should not have had to go through the Park at all—I went into the Park at the Stableyard-gate, and out at Buckingham-gate—it was not getting on for twelve o'clock, for I was home at a little after eleven—I did not notice the time when I got home, but I had heard either the Abbey or St. Margaret's clock strike, and I got home about ten minutes after that—I was at the corner of the Park, I dare say, when I heard the clock strike—a young man lodges with me, he is twenty-four years of age, I believe—no other male—my father does not live with me, he only comes occasionally—itwas in James-street that Chittem demanded the 1s.—that was the first I noticed of them after I left the public-house—they were before me—when I saw Fletcher, on the 27th, I did not tell him where I lived, nor did I tell them when at the public-house.

Q. But they were before you on your road home, when you got to that street? A. Yes—it was not far from my house—they were walking—Chitteminstantly accosted me, and said he wanted Is. for a bed, that he was in Lord—'s service, and had been locked out of the barracks—Fletcher had told me on the Friday evening that he was in the service of a lady in the Regent's-park—I had not asked him his name or what he was—my father lives at Sand's-end cottage, Sand's-end, King's-road, Fulham—I did not go to tell him what he had happened, because I had no one to leave in my place—Idid not write to tell him—I thought this a very extraordinary thing, but the fright and dread of being accused of such a crime, and being subject to fits as I have been, (I had one only last Sunday) and they said they would never come near the place again, I thought it would have died away, and no notice be taken of it—I did not name it to any one before I named it to my father—I did not go after the prisoners to see where they lived—the phrase they used the fourth time I saw them was, "Such and such a character

"—it was on that occasion I borrowed the money—I borrowed one sovereign of Mr. Beasley, a linen-draper, in Great Chapel-street—he is not here—that sovereign Fletcher had—the one I gave Chittem I borrowed of Mr. Jacques, a plumber and glazier, in Tothill-street.

Fletcher. Q. When you met me in the Strand, what were the words you used to me? A. I did not see you in the Strand—I did not say to you, "How nice your boot-tops look"—I did not walk with you down the Strand, and ask you whether Chittem was a young man out of York-shire, nor that I thought I knew him—I did not ask you to have a glass of ale with me in Cheapside—I did not take you to a cofiee-shop at the back of the Mansion-house, as we could not get any ale—I went to an upholsterer's shop at the back of the Mansion-house—that was my friend's—Idid not tell you to wait for me—I did not go with you into a Tom and Jerry shop, and have two pints of ale—I did not invite you to ask Chittem to come on the Sunday night to Piccadilly—nothing of the kind—I did not say he was not the young man I knew, but as he was in a livery-stable I could get him a situation—you did not tell me he lived at a Mr. Shaw's—wehad no such conversation—I did not ask you to go and have something to drink.

Q. Did not you go into this public-house, and call for a glass of rum-and-water? A. You called for all the liquor yourselves—I did not call for any—I did not invite you and Chittem home to supper—I never should have thought of inviting two strangers, particularly two servants whom I knew nothing of—I did not tell Chittem to come to my house on the Wednesday following, and I would let him know about the situation—nothing of the kind—no mention was made of any situation—I did not ask you for your character—I did not know whether you were in or out of a situation till the morning you were taken into custody—I did not come to you at any Mews—I did not want to pull you about or take hold of you in an indecent manner—I never laid a finger on you—when you was given in charge you set up this defence, and denied it in the presence of a witness now here—I did not run away as you resisted—you did not give me a slap on the head.





MATTHIAS WILLIAM CUNDALE
. I am a surgeon, and live at Fulham—myson first mentioned to me about this transaction on Christmas-eve, after the business of the shop was over—I was in his shop—Fletcher was there at the time—my son requested me to tell him to go about his business—Idid not see Chittem at that time, but when I went out to ask Fletcher what he wanted, whether he wanted any prescription, he called to Chittem, who was by the side of him, "Jim," and he came to him immediately—theywere not given in charge that night—I do not rightly know why, perhaps from the confusion of the business—in fact, I did not then know what their business was—it was after they were gone my son told me—we were very busy then—when I asked Fletcher his business, he said, "He knows what I want," or, "what I want him for," I canot exactly charge my memory which—they remained a considerable time after I returned to my son, but he did not tell me till they were gone—he did then, and I advised him to apply to a policeman—I am certain the prisoners are the two men.





WILLIAM APPLEBEE
. I am a baker, and am acquainted with the prosecutor—Inever saw him in company with Fletcher—I saw Fletcher at Queen's-square after he was taken, but not before. On the 11th of January

I was sent for to Mr. Cundale's, a little before twelve o'clock, and found Fletcher there—Mr. Cundale was in the room at the time—I asked Fletcher what he wanted—he said he wanted that villian, pointing to the prosecutor—I asked him what he came and kicked up a disturbance at the house for, why not take other proceedings if he wanted him—he said he would not go till he had him at Queen's-square with him—I advised him to go away, but he would not—I asked the prosecutor in Fletcher's presence what he came there about, and he said he had given Fletcher money at different times—he said at one time he gave him one sovereign and 5s.—Fletchersaid, "What did you give it me for?"—the prosecutor said, "To get rid of you, not thinking to hear of you again"—Fletcher said, "Do you think you would have given me the money if you had not done such a crime?"—Mr. Hunt, a friend of Mr. Cundale's, then came, in, and asked Fletcher what he meant by kicking up a disturbance, and extorting money from him previously—he said, "That villian is not fit to live," and called him all manner of bad names, and said he would not go without him—Mr. Hunt went and looked for a policeman, and when Fletcher saw that, he wanted to go—as soon as Mr. Hunt went to look out of the door, he was going—I asked him to stop a minute or two, knowing what my friend was about, and a policeman came and took him.

Fletcher. I never mentioned any money—how could you hear me mention any thing if you were not there? you said just now you never saw me and the prosecutor together. Witness. I meant never before I was called that evening—I went in hearing a person speaking violently in the prosecutor's shop.





GEORGE JACQUES
. I am a glazier, and am acquainted with the prosecutor—Ilent him a sovereign on Saturday night, the 19th of December last.





WILLIAM ANNADALE
 (police-constable B 86.) On the 11th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, a person named Hunt came and told me there was a disturbance at Mr. Cundale's—I went and saw Fletcher—Itold him it was on Mr. Cundale's charge that I apprehended him, and that he must come before a Magistrate with me—he said it was Mr. Cundale that ought to have been taken, and not him—he made use of bad expressions, and the crowd called Mr. Cundale bad names, such as a s—I took Fletcher to the police-office.

Fletcher. Q. Did not I give Mr. Cundale into custody to you first? A. No—you resisted going to the station—after I took you you said you gave Mr. Cundale in charge—that was after he had preferred his charge to me for extorting money—I cannot say exactly when Chittem was taken—I was not at Queen-square when he was brought there—I did not see him till the Friday following, to which day he was remanded.

The prisoner Fletcher called,






JAMES BUDD
. I am waiter at the Unicorn tavern, at the corner of Duke-street, St. James's—I knew neither of the prisoners till the night I saw them together with the prosecutor—they had a glass of rum-and-water, a pot of half-and-half, a screw of tobacco, and a cigar, and were all very comfortable and friendly together—they left 4d. in my debt.

Q. Did Mr. Cundale run into your house to get out of the way? A. did not see them come in, my master served them first—the prosecutor

sat between the two prisoners—I do not believe the prosecutor smoked, but both the prisoners did.

Fletcher. The prosecutor said it was two cigars, and not tobacco.

On the 3d of October, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, my apprentice called me; I went to the front window and saw the prisoner with the desk under his arm, covered with green baize; I ran down and followed him towards the City-road - He was walking; I found my shop-door open - I missed the desk - I collared him and asked him where he was going with it; he said a man gave it to him to carry.I took it from him and brought him back-it was not wrapped in baize in the shop.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was standing by the door, two men were in the shop and asked me to carry the desk to the Red Lion, in the City-road; they crossed over-the prosecutor took me.

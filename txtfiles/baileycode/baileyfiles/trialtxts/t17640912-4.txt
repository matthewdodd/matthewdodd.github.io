. On the 29th of July, the prisoner came to my shop, and said, he wanted to buy a watch (I am a watch-maker
): I shewed him several, but none would suit; I went to the stair foot, to call to my wife to bring down another, and left five or six before him; after that, we agreed for one, and he offered me a shilling earnest: I said, I expected the money, if he had the watch. I suspected he had no good design; I looked about, and missed a watch, and charged him with taking it, which he absolutely denied, and turned out a tobacco-box from his pocket, and said, you see I have not got it: but when he saw I was for taking him by the collar. then he took my watch out of his pocket, and said, here is your watch; then he was for getting away, but I turned the key upon him, and got assistance, and secured him.

            . I saw some people about the prosecutor's door; I went to see what was the matter, and he called me in, and gave me charge of the prisoner: in going along to the justice, he offered to spend a shilling, to make it up.

Prosecutor. He might be in liquor for what I know, I never saw him before; he lives at Old Brentford. I have been and enquired his character, and find his neighbours give him a good one. I should be glad to recommend him to favour.

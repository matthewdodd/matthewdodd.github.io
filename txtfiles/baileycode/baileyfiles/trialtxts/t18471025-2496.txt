ROBERT WAITE
 was again indicted for

 stealing 5 1/4 lbs. weight of cheese, value 3s. 9d.; and 2 8/4lbs. weight of bacon, 2s. 3d.; the goods of 



George Pickett, his master: and 




ELIZABETH SYMMONDS
 and 



EDWARD PICKERING



, for feloniously receiving the same: to which


WAITE pleaded 


GUILTY. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.







GEORGE PICKETT.
 I have lost some bacon and cheese, besides that charged in the other case, altogether about 120l. worth—I know that Mrs. Boakes received it of Mrs. Symmonds. WILLIAM COOMBS (policeman.) I went to Mrs. Symmonds, told her I came to search her house, said that Waite was in custody for robbing his master, and asked if she had any butter and cheese there—she said she had not—I said, "Do you mean to say you never had, for he has told all about it?"—she said, "I have, but I have always paid for it"—I said, "I must go over the house"—I did so, I found no bacon.





ELBANOR BOAKES.
 I bought some bacon of Mrs. Symmonds—she said she was obliged to take it for a bad debt when she was in business—I have had two hams—(produced)—I have had butter, cheese, and bacon—I cannot tell to what amount—it is in the book—it may be 15l.—I and she kept the book—she had things of me as well as I having things of her.





GEORGE PICKETT

re-examined. This butter is mine—Waite had the opportunity of taking it—I charged him with robbing me, I did not say what of—he confessed it—I had not seen the bacon there—I have not spoken to him about it since—Symmonds frequently came to the shop in my absence.
(MR. CLARKSON
contended that Symmonds was the thief, and not the receiver.)

SYMMONDS—


NOT GUILTY.


PICKERING—


NOT GUILTY.

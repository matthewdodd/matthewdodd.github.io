                  PRIOR
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jones. I am a constable of the Ward of Bassishaw: On Friday, the 6th of March, at 6th o'clock in the evening, I was coming up Basinghall-street


, past the warehouse of the prosecutors, I saw 
               
                  William 
                  Widdison
               



            , 
               
                  William 
                  Croson
               



            , and 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Croson
               



            ; there was another man with them, but I cannot say whether it was the other prisoner or not; Widdison was looking in at the sash door of the warehouse; I then passed on, and Widdison joined the other three; I then went to William Mead, to request him to go with me; we went down the street, and saw William Croson and Samuel Croson Standing in the street, in conversation together; at that time I did not see any thing of the other two; I then returned again up the street towards Cateaton-street; on my return back again, William and 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Croson
               



             were still in the same situation; I then went to a house opposite Mr. Swaine's, from which I had a complete command of Mr. Swaine's warehouse; soon after I was in the house, 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher
               



             came to the house; we staid there some short time, and three of the prisoners, Widdison, and William and Samuel Croson, passed the warehouse of Mr. Swaine several times; there was another person with them whom I do not know, he was a tall man, he opened Mr. Swaine's door; it appeared to me as though he lifted the latch, but I am not certain; I saw him go in and come out again; upon that I opened the door of the house where I was, and looked for them, they were then all gone; I went over to Mr. Swaine's, and remained in the warehouse about a quarter of an hour; there were several persons then passed door very swift, two of them were Widdison and William Croson; one of the two shoved the door open a little way, it was then repeated by another, and then another, till it was about half way open, and then 
               
                  William 
                  Croson
               



             came into the warehouse, Widdison was behind him, in company with him; 
               
                  William 
                  Croson
               



             took this piece of cloth from off the table that stood in the warehouse, where there was some other cloth; I then put my arm over William Croson's shoulder, and laid hold of Widdison; then Croson dropped the cloth, and Widdison escaped; I then secured Croson, and never quitted my hold of him; 
               
                  William 
                  Croson
               



             gave me several violent blows on the side of my head, which was the reason Widdison's escaping; I had seen William Croson Samuel Croson on Thursday evening, the 5th, and on Saturday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw Samuel and John Croson at a public-house, in Grub-street, and apprehended them.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jones. I am a porter, at Blackwell-hall. On the 6th of March I was with Mr. Prior at the house opposite Mr. Swaine's; I had before that seen the four prisoners at the bar in conversation in Basinghall-street; I am certain of all of them, I am well acquainted with their faces; I stood the space of a minute looking at them; they then separated: two of them came up on one side of the street, and two on the other; I passed them a second time, within about twenty yards of the prosecutor's house; John Crosen at this time pretended to make water against a corner; I stood looking at him for the space of another minute, or a minute and a half, or thereabout; Widdison went up Blackhall's-yard, returned down again immediately, and passed the prosecutor's house; they took particular notice of the house; I then went to a house opposite the prosecutor's.
Q. What was the reason of your going into that house? - A. Knowing them to be suspected characters, I went in to watch; after I was got into the house, I observed 
               
                  John 
                  Croson
               



             opened the prosecutor's door, and return from it immediately, and I saw no more of either of them for a quarter of an hour, or it might be twenty minutes after, I saw the four prisoners again; one of them opened the door, I believe Widdison, I am not certain; a person next to him pushed if further, and it was repeated by a third person; just after that I saw Widdison and 
               
                  William 
                  Croson
               



             go into the house; before that I saw one of them lift young Widdison up to look over the blinds, but which of them it was I do not know; I saw no more of them till I heard the cry of stop thief; then I ran after Widdison, but Mr. Swaine's porter,

            , had taken him before I got up; I was with Mr. Prior the next morning when he took Samuel and John Croson at a public-house, in Grub-street; I identified them both as soon as I got into the house.
Cross-exained by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you went to Grub-street, did you take a person of the name of Rigby with you? - A. There was a person, but I did not know his name.
Q. Upon your oath, was not that person taken because he knew the persons of Samuel and 
               
                  John 
                  Croson
               



            , and you did not? - A. I don't know.

Q. Did you know John Croson before that night? - A. No.
Q. Then how dare you tell that Jury that you knew them to be suspected characters? - A. I did not say so; I said, from the information I received.
Q. Attend, Sir, and recollect there is such a thing as a prosecution for perjury; upon your oath, did you not swear that Jury, that knowing them to be suspected characters, you watched them? - A. I said, from the information I had of them.
Q. Attend to the question, and recollect you are in a very serious situation; do you mean now to swear, that you did not before swear, that because they were suspicious characters, you watched them? - A. I don't remember saying so.
Q. Do you mean to say, that you did not swear that knowing them to be suspicious characters, you watched them? - A. If that was taken down in my examination, it was taken down wrong; if I did mention such a thing, it was inadvertently.
Q. There is a great difference between John Croson and 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Croson
               



            ? - A. Certainly.

             that opened the door? - A. yes.
Q. It was not Samuel, but John? - A. It was John.

Q. Don't you know that they are indicted for breaking open that house in the night, which we call burglary? - A. Is burglary and larceny the same thing?
Q. I see you are a little bit of a lawyer - Upon your oath, don't you know that these people are indicted for a burglary, for breaking open this house in the night? - A. I don't know what the indictment expressed.
Q. Upon your oath, don't your know that they were indicted, and charged with breaking open this house in the night time? - A. I should suppose it is.
Q. Upon your oath, were you not bound over to prosecute for burglary? - A. I know I was bound over.
Q. Don't you know there is a reward of 40l. for each of these persons, if they are convicted? - A. I have heard as much, but I don't know it.
Q. You believe it, don't you? - A. I have no reason to believe it.

Q. Do you believe it? - A. I never had the money, nor was ever in a situation to receive it.
Q. I do not now ask you whether you know there is a reward ot 40l. but I ask you, do you believe there is a reward of 40l. on the conviction of each of these prisoners? - A. How am I to believe it?
Q. I will tell you how you are to believe it; you may be informed of a thing, and believe that information - Now, I ask you, do you believe there is a reward of 40l.? - A. From the best information I ever had, I believe there is.
Q. Then if you convict only one, you believe there is a reward of 40l.? - A. Yes.

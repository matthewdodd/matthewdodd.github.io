2614. 




JAMES BOWYER
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of August, 1 coat, value 16s., the goods of 



Robert Lester.






ROBERT LESTER
 (police-sergeant E 10.) I was stationed at George-street station-house—I had a great-coat hanging on a peg in the passage leading to the kitchen—I missed it about the 9th of August—I saw it again on the 4th of September—this is it—it is my own private coat—at the time I lost it the prisoner was living at the George-street station-house.





MATTHEW KILLINGWORTH
. I am a shopman to Mr. Perkins, a pawnbroker, at Chelsea. On the 9th of August I took in this coat of a prisone in police clothes—the prisoner is the person, to the best of my recollection, though the difference of dress makes a great deal of difference—to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man.





ALLEN HORATIO GARMAN
. I took the prisoner. I searched his box, and found some letters in it—in one, which was addressed to James Bowyer, I found the duplicate of this great-coat, pawned on the 9th of August, in the name of John Britton, Battersea—the prisoner's father lives at Battersea, and the pawnbroker's is in the road from the station-house to his father's house.




GUILTY
 Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years longer.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

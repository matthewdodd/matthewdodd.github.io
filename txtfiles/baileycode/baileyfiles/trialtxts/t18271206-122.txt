JOHN BECKETT. On the 29th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Whitechapel


, sitting at the back of a Blackwall coach, between two gentlemen; a person ran behind, and said, we were robbed; I felt and missed my handkerchief, which had been safe just before, in my coat-pocket - I rode on, and did nothing.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of November, I was in Whitechapel, and saw the stage coming from Church-lane; the prisoner ran behind, got up, and hung by his hands for about a hundred yards; he took a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and then got down - I ran up and took him with it, took him to the watch-house, and sent Fryer to tell the gentleman; there were some other boys at the corner of Church-lane, but not in company with the prisoner.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer a boy 5s. to say I was in it? A. I did not - I found 6s. 3d. on him; he said,"You may take that, and let me go" - I said, that was not the way I did my duty.

            . I saw the prisoner get behind the stage, and take the handkerchief - I ran and told the gentleman.
Prisoner's Defence. I ran to get a ride, and saw the handkerchief lay where the gentleman put their feet.

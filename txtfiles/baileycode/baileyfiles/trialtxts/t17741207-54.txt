            . I am a hosier
. On the 12th of November, I went out about eleven o'clock: when I returned, which was about four, I missed the stockings, mentioned in the indictment, out of the window: I saw them about an hour before I went out; they were offered to sale in Rosemary-Lane, and stopped.
They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.

            . The prisoner offered me the stockings to sale: I suspected him; and took him before Justice Sherwood; there he said, he found them on a butcher's block at White Chapell: when I told him they were advertised: he said, he was willing to go before a justice.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to drink part of a pint of beer, and found them on a butcher's block, in White-Chapell.
He called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

I am an undertaker
, on the 2d of February, I was sent for into Fleet Market to see some sconces, I did not know I had lost any, I went immediately, and I found them to be my property; they were in bags, there was twelve branches and twelve backs, some were in the backs and some out; I took time to place them, and when I returned, I found a box laying upon a pile of deal boards in which they had been; I was in the warehouse at half past three, and the box was in its usual place; I had occasion to go up to it; this was near five, they were obliged to get over these deals to get at it, I do not know who took them.

I was coming up Field Lane, I went to buy some nails, and heard Mr. Hayward say as I was at his door, that he would have nothing to do with them: the two prisoners were both there, and the woman said bid money for them, they had them between them: I thought there were stolen goods, and I went in, I followed them up Fleet Lane, while he was weighing my nails, I looked out to see which way they went; they went into the White Horse, and they stood in the middle of the road, and the man shifted his load to the woman; they went down the Old Bailey, and I saw the man take some halfpence out of the woman's pocket, and he had two dips for a quartern gin, I followed them, and says I, what have you to sell, says she, nothing at all, says I, I am sure you have; says she, you may take them all; I stopped her, and the man ran away: I brought the woman in Ludgate Hill, and she said, she would have a coach, says I, I will take you down to my shop, and send one of my men, till I know who owns these goods, I sent a man, and took the woman to my shop, and the man prisoner came to enquire for her at the watch-house.

PRISONER MILLER'S DEFENCE.
The prisoner Dally, asked me to carry a few things for them, which I did, he said he would give me six-pence, but where he had them I do not know; then a gentleman came, and asked me what I had, I told him to look and see, for they did not belong to me.

"offer something for them? " - The woman.

GEORGE FINNIGAN
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker. One of these shawls was pawned by Raffaelli, on the 24th of May.





FRANCIS BEST
. I am in the employ of a pawnbroker. This other shawl was pawned by Raffaelli, on the 24th of May.

Raffaelli. I pawned them, but I did not know they were stolen; alter I found they were stolen I went to the pawnbroker's and stopped them.

Witness. He came to me, with Sullivan's mother, and said he did not know they were stolen, but he had them of the little boy, who had no food to eat.

Sullivan. Sometimes my mother would not give me anything to eat.

                  , from his person
            .
BARNARD WILLIAM MORELAND. I am a wax-chandler
, and live in Oxford-street. On the 14th of August I was in Nassau-street - a person named Woodward came and asked if I had lost my handkerchief; I felt, and found it was gone - he then shewed it to me; I had had it not ten minutes before.
Prisoner. The gentleman said at the office that it was not his property. Witness. No - I expressed no doubt about it.


                  JOHN 
                  WOODWARD
               



            . I was in Mortimer-street


 - I saw the prisoner and another lad following this gentleman, for about one hundred and fifty yards - I then saw them separate suddenly; I took the prisoner, and found the handkerchief between his trousers and his jacket. When I said I would take him he threw himself down, and began to kick; I took him up, and carried him to Nassau-street, where I found the prosecutor.
Prisoner. I had found it half an hour before.
JOHN WOODWARD. I followed him all the way up Mortimer-street, and am quite sure he did not pick it up.

            . Aged 12.




               Transported for Fourteen Years

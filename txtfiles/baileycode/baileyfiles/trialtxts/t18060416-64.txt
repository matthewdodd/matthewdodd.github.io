                  Betsy 
                  Clarke
               



            , the old woman (
               
                  Mary 
                  Wilts
               



            ), and me, remained in the coach while she went and pawned them; we waited at Covent Garden while 
               
                  Betsy 
                  Clarke
               



             went and fetched Wilts, before we took the coach at Charing Cross; 
               
                  Betsy 
                  Clarke
               



             returned to Poll Weston, me, and Mrs. Wilts, and said they would lend no more than a guinea and a half upon the two watches, and she thought it a great deal too little, she asked Mrs. Wilt, whether she had not better pawn the watches, Mrs. Wilts said she had better return back and pawn the two watches, which she did; they were pawned for a guinea and a half; then we told the coachman to drive us to the top of Holborn; Poll Weston and 
               
                  Betsy 
                  Clarke
               



             went and pawned the tea pot for two pounds.
Q. You did not go with them. - A. I did not; we all of us went to a hatter's shop at the top of Holborn, and we bought a black beaver hat for each of us; we went to a public house near Drury-lane, Poll Weston then had the property in her apron at that time, we stopped at the public house till twelve o'clock, 
               
                  Betsy

             and I left Poll Weston with the property.

Q. What were they. - A. A silver tea pot, a gold watch, and several India silk handkerchiefs, and a silk shawl, five silver table spoons, and four silver tea spoons.
Q. Was Mrs. Witts exceeding drunk. - A. She was.
Q. She is apt to get drunk, is not she. - A. Yes.
JAMES - sworn. I live with Mr. Warner, High Holborn; the prisoner brought this tea pot in to pledge, and a girl of the name of Clarke was behind her.
Q. When was it. - A. On the 19th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I lent her two guineas on it, I am sure she is the girl, I had known her about two years.
Q. Could you take in such a pot as that without suspecting her. - A. I did suspect her, but she evaded my questions by saying her brother and she had a few words, and the name that she told me corresponded with the cypher, she was better dressed, and looked a respectable person; she only asked two guineas, she seemed to know the worth of it; it was certainly an error of judgment, I confess.
Court. I can excuse errors of judgment, but this was an error of the heart.
Weston. I pledged the tea pot with him for Mrs. Witts, he asked me my name, I told him it was Johanna Wilts, I told him he need not be under any apprehension of taking it in, I had not stole it, I knew I had not.

JOHN WHITNEY sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 78, Drury-lane. On the 20th of March, the prisoner

                  PICKERING
               



             sworn. I am patrole and goaler of Bow-street. On the 21st of March the prisoners Clarke and Blake were brought to the office; Blackman and I were sent with Blake and Clarke for Mrs. Wilts; I produce a black beaver bonnet, which I took from the prisoner Clarke by the order of the magistrate; she acknowledged it was bought with part of the money the property was pawned for.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BLACKMAN
               



             sworn. I am an officer of the public office, Bow-street. On the 21st of March Pickering and I went with Clarke and Blake to No. 4, Steward's Rents, to search for 
               
                  Mary 
                  Wilts
               



            ; she was not at her lodgings till about six o'clock; on the morning of the 22d, when I apprehended her, I searched about the room, and found no property.


                  JOHN 
                  CORDERY
               



             sworn. I am constable of the precinct of White Friers. On the 20th of March the son of the prosecutrix came to me to take Clarke into custody; I took her into custody at the house of Mrs. Witts, in Water-lane, Fleet-street. In searching of her I found seven pennyworth of halfpence, and three duplicates, one for a pair of pattens for fourpence, the other a petticoat for half a crown, and the third was the duplicate for that handkerchief which the pawnbroker has produced. (The tea pot identified by the prosecutrix.)
Clarke's Defence. That is my own hankerchief, and the hat is my own, I had fifteen shillings given me the night before, I gave thirteen shillings for the hat.
Q. (to Blake) Look at that hat. - A. This is the the same hat which we bought, each of us had one of these hats.
Weston's Defence. Mrs. Witts desired me to pledge the tea pot; I have lived with Mrs. Witts ever since I was twelve years old; she was obliged to quit her house, a gentleman lost his gold watch there, she then removed to the lodgings in Drury-lane; since I have been in trouble she was obliged to remove again to Clement's Inn.

GEORGE WICKS
 and 




HENRY EDWARDS
 were indicted for

stealing, on the

Sophia Elvin.






SOPHIA ELVIN
. I keep a book shop in Tabernacle-square. I saw the two prisoners and a smaller boy loitering about my shop about half-past eleven, o'clock in the day—they stood handling the books—I told them to go on, as I thought they were thieves—I did not perceive that they had got any books—they went away, and the policeman came in three quarters of an hour, and brought me this book, which has my mark in it—I saw the prisoners in custody the same day—I know them to be the boys I had seen.





WILLIAM COX
 (police-constable N 201.) On the 25th of April, I was on duty in East-road—I saw the two prisoners and a smaller boy—Wicks had this book and was looking at it—I asked him where he got it—he said he bought it for 3d., and showed me 3d., in his hand, which he said he had received in change for 6d.—I took him, and the other two ran away—Sayer took the other prisoner.





JOHN SAYER
 (police-constable N 84.) I apprehended Edwards while Cox was gone to the station with Wicks—I asked him where he got the book, he said he had bought it of a Jew.

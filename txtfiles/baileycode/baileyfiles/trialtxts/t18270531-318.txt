JOHN HAMELL. I am a hosier
, and live in Aldersgate-street


. On the evening of the 30th of May, at a quarter past nine o'clock, I was serving a lady, and heard a report of a pull, which pulled these stockings down, they hung about two feet within the door, and were pinned with two strong pins. I turned my eye, that way and missed them. I made no noise, but pursued the prisoner, who I caught sight of about ten yards from the house, and stopped him forty yards off with the stockings rolled up in an apron, which was tied before him - there were two others in his company. I had see the prisoner before, and cautioned him to be careful.

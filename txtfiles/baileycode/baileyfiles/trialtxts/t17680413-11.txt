            . I am a matross
, and live at Woolwich; I lost a blue surtout coat the 21st of March, from the Brown Bear in Devonshire-street, Queen's-square


, and found it hanging up at the door of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ross

            . I keep a sale-shop in Monmouth-street. On the 21st of March, between six and seven at night, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I would buy a coat; I bought it of him for 6 s. (produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)

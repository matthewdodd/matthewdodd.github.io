            , who lived in Harley-street, Cavendish-square


. I had the care of the plate. On the 6th of August, at a quarter past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner go out of the area gate from the house; I looked and missed the spoons, which were safe two minutes before; I pursued him; he walked a few paces from the gate, and then began to run; I took him in Prince's-street. I found a table spoon in his right hand; a person lifted up a sack which he had over his left shoulder, and in his left hand were the other three. He said nothing.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

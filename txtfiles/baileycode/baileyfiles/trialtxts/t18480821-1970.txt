, stealing 1 watch, value 4l., the goods of 



James M'Farlane, from his person.







JAMES M'FARLANE
. On 18th Aug., between nine and ten o'clock at night I met the prisoner and another female near the railway station, St. Pancras—we went to about three public-houses—I afterwards went with them to a private house—the prisoner asked me the time—I took out my watch and told her, looking her in the lace at the time—I heard the clasp of a pair of scissors and found my guard was cut, the other female was sitting on the hed, but the prisoner was close to me—she snatched the watch, and handed it to the girl behind her, who went out of the room, with her hands behind her—here is part of the guard, which remained round my neck—it is silk—I said I would give her 1l. or 2 rather than lose my watch—I went outside the door, but the girl was gone—I could not find a policeman for an hour—I gave the prisoner in charge next evening—I have not seen my watch since.





JERIMIAH LOCHERBY

            . On Wednesday was Fortnight I saw the Prisoner come out of my Kitchen with something in her Apron, and was going up Stairs; I asked her what she had in her Apron; she said, nothing of mine: I said, I would see; she said, if I would go back again into the Kitchen, she would show me: When she came into the Kitchen, she threw the Sheet down upon the Bed.

            . On the 29th of December I saw the Prisoner throw this Sheet out of her Lap upon Mrs Titt's Bed: I had left the Key of the Kitchen in the Door, and missing it, I asked her for it, and she pulled it out of her Bosom, and gave it me. I saw this Blanket lie upon the Stairs.

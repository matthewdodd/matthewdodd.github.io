            . I am in the service of Mr.

Aldermen
 William Venables, who has a partner; they are paper manufacturers
. Yesterday evening I was driving the waggon in Camomile-street


; it contained different reams of paper - I stopped the horses - as I turned my head, I saw a man's head above the rail of the waggon - I went to the tail of the waggon, and found the prisoner getting out over the tail - I laid hold of him, and he had a ream of paper in his hand - I collared and held him fast, till I got him into a shop, and gave him in charge; he had a ream of quarto post, worth 13s.; he was a stranger; he said nothing; two other persons endeavoured to get him away - they were between the hind wheel of the waggon and the wall, when I first seized him; they endeavoured to prevent my getting hold of him; they dragged me to the other side of the road, but I kept hold of him; he dropped the paper the moment I collared him - I picked it up, and missed a ream from the waggon.
Prisoner. He never saw me near the waggon. Witness. I laid hold of him coming out of the waggon with it in his hand.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, after he was secured.
Prisoner. I am innocent - I work hard for my living; I worked two years for Mr. Smart, who used to live in Basinghall-street.

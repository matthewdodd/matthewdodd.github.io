GEORGE WARDEN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
4th of April, 1 coat, value 15s., the goods of 



Mary Parry; and I comforter, value 6d., the goods of 



James Stone.






JOSEPH OAKLET
 (police-constable D 83.) I was in Cavendish-square, on the 4th of April, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running before the mob—I took him—he was trying to take off the coat that he had on—I asked what was the matter—he said he had done nothing—I said, "Let us go back to those people who are crying out"—I went back, and one of them had a great coat on his shoulder—he said, "This is the coat the man stole; he took it from the carriage, as it was going along Cavendish-square, and he threw it into the square"—I took the prisoner—he said, "You are mistaken, I am not the man"—when I apprehended him there was a person said, "Policeman, you have got the wrong man"—whether he was an accomplice or not I cannot say.





JOHN COOPER
. I was going along Cavendish-square—I crossed, and saw the prisoner running by the side of a carriage, which was going along at a pretty good rate; the prisoner kept pace with it about a minute—I saw him take the coat out of the carriage—he either opened the door, or else put his arm over the little window, I am not sure which—the coachman was with the carriage, but no footman—I hallooed out "Stop thief," and he threw the coat over the railings into the square, and ran away.





JAMES STOKE
. I am footman to Mrs. Mary Parry—it is my coat—I had put it into the carriage in the Haymarket, and drew up the blinds—I told the coachman what time he was ordered, and he went home—it was about a quarter past eight o'clock—there was a comforter in it, which was mine—I left it in the carriage.




GUILTY
. Aged 41.—


Transported for Seven Years.

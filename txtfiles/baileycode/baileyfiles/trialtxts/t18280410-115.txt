JAMES SMITH. I am a tobacconist
, and live at No. 27. Quadrant


. On the evening of the 28th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I and my wife were in the parlour; she heard something, and went into the shop; the prisoner was there - he asked for a situation; she said, she knew of none; but on looking round, she saw a gap in the boxes in the window - I went out and seized the prisoner; I asked if he had taken any boxes, he said, No, I said, if he had not, he knew who had; I searched him, but found nothing - I fetched the watchman who found these three boxes in his breeches; I had boxes of this description in my window, and I believe these to be mine - he must have reached out his arm to get them.

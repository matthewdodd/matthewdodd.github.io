            . I am a sawyer. I stopped the prisoner, on the 26th, with the plank; he offered to sell it to me in Long-alley; he asked me fourteen shillings for it. I took him to a public-house and detained him, and sent to the office.
Prisoner's Defence. The piece of mahogany I am charged with stealing, I acknowledge having it in my possession; it was not taken from the prosecutor with any intention of stealing it. I had done work for the prosecutor; and on the evening I had done work for the prosecutor, he paid me part of the same, and the board was given for the rest.
Q. (to prosecutor.) Did he work for you - A. Yes; about a year ago he used to saw for me; I did not owe him any thing. The plank is worth thirty shillings.

            , aged 37.

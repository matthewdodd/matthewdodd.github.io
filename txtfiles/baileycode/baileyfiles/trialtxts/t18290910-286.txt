. The prisoner and another man came there with each a basket, on the 6th of August - the prisoner asked for some half-boots to look at, and then said he would come again; the other man then said he would come again - my wife said to the prisoner."Where are those I showed you?" he said, "You put them into the glass case:" I said to him, "Let me look into your basket;" he set off and ran - I pursued; he dropped the basket, and it contained these boots; I took them up, and a neighbour stopped him - I gave him in charge.

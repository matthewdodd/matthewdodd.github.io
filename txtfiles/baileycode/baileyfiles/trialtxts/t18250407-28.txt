PETER RIERSON. I live in Upper Harley-street - I have retired from business. On the 23d of February I was in Harley-street


, going home about six o'clock in the evening - my handkerchief was in my outside coat pocket - I had not seen the prisoner; I was walking very quick, and felt some person at my pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner close by me; I took hold of him, and said he had got my handkerchief; he denied it, and pointed to the handkerchief, which was then laying on the ground; he ran away; I pursued him, and did not lose sight of him till he was taken. When I came back the handkerchief had been taken away.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody. The handkerchief has not been found.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a number of persons, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran with others, and a man came up to me, took hold of my collar, and said a gentleman in the next street wished to speak to me, and he took me back to him.

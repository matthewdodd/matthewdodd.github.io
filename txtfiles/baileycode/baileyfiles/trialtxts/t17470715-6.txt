                  Jennings 
               



            . On the 3 d of July , I left the Prisoner at the Bar with 4 or 5 more drinking, and my Wife some time after informed me there was a Tankard missing, we enquired among the Company, but could not bear any thing of it; when the Prisoner was first taxt with it, he denied it, but last Tuesday he said he would confess where the Tankard was; so I took a Search-warrant, and went to Mr Grindall's House and found the Tankard. When I carried him before the Justice, the Justice examined him, and he did not deny it, that he had took the Tankard and sold it.
The Prisoner reply'd; that what Mr Jennings had said was true.



                  William 
                  Grindall 
               



             . On the 3d of July , the Prisoner brought this Tankard to my Shop, and asked me if I bought old Silver; so he pulled that Tankard out of his Pocket, and I gave 5 s. an Ounce for it, and about 2 or 3 Days ago the Tankard was advertised .
Court to the Prisoner. Mr Grindall says you sold him the Tankard the 3 d of July .
Prisoner. Yes, please your Lordship .
Q. How much did Mr Grindall give you for the Tankard.
Prisoner. Three Pound sixteen Shillings .
Mr Baxter, with whom the Prisoner had lived in the Capacity of a Footman, said he believed the Prisoner was honest while he lived with him , but would drink, and that was the Reason of his putting him away .



               Guilty
             .

            . Just before Christmas the prisoner, I, and 
               
                  James 
                  Brown 
               



            , were going by Mr. Booth's brewhouse in Old-Street


, and went into the brewhouse yard, as I believe it is called, where turning ourselves about, we happened to see these hoops stand against the wall.
Q. Do you remember the particular time of it?
Price. I do not.
Q. How many hoops were there?
Price. I don't know; we took away half a dozen.
Q. What hoops were they?
Price. They call them vat hoops. The prisoner said to me, we can sell these hoops to Joneswho will buy any thing. He lives in Playhouse-Yard, Whitecross-Street. We sold two to Mr. Jones.
Q. Were you all together when you took them away?
Price. We were.
Q. Was you at the selling of the two to Jones?
Price. I was at the door while the prisoner sold them.
Q. What is Jones?
Price. He is a man that buys old iron, or any thing in that way.
Q. Was any body else with you at the selling of them?
Price. Yes, 
               
                  James 
                  Brown 
               



             was with me at the door.
Q. How much were they sold for?
Price. I cannot tell.
Q. How much money had you for your share?
Price. I cannot justly tell, but I believe I had about two shillings, or some such thing. It was what he was pleased to give me on his own accord.
Q. What did you do with the other hoops you had?
Price. We sold them under London-Wall the very next morning. We were then all together.
Q. To whom did you sell them?
Price. I don't know the man's name.
Q. What did you receive of him for these four?
Price. They were sold for a penny a pound, but I cannot tell what they came to.
Q. What was your share of that?
Price. I cannot tell justly what it was.

                  Bowler 
               



            . I have put the hoops on and off several times, being a backmaker and cooper by trade. I knocked the vessel to pieces, and was to have put it together again, but the brickwork was not ready; and when that was ready, we missed the hoops.
Q. How many did you miss?
Bowler. There were six hoops lost.
Q. Whose property were they?
Bowler. They were the property of Mr. 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Booth

            . I live in Playhouse-Yard, Whitecross-Street, and much about Christmas last 
               
                  Charles 
                  Foring 
               



             came and brought some hoops to sell.
Q. What is your business ?
Jones. I deal in old iron, and have done for many years.
Q. Did you know 
               
                  Charles 
                  Foring 
               



             before this time?
Jones. Yes, I did.

Q. How many hoops did he bring?
Jones. Two.
Q. Was there any body with him at that time?
Jones. No, not as I know of.
Q. Did you buy them ?
Jones. I did.
Q. What did you give him for them?
Jones. I gave him at the rate of nine shillings and fourpence per hundred.
Q. Did any body apply to you for these hoops afterwards?
Jones. No; but reading the Daily Advertiser, and finding they were advertised, I went and fetched them from Mr. Humphrey's, to whom they were sold, in order that 'Squire Booth might have them again, and paid the money back.
Q. Did you return them to the owner?
Jones. Yes, I did, and he owned them.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, nor called any witnesses in his behalf.

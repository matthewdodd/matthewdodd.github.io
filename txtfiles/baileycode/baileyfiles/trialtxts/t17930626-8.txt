            's a taylor, No. 1, Saville-passage, Saville-street


, where I was at work; I am a taylor
; as soon as I set down to work I took my watch out of my pocket, and put it in the corner by my side as I always do; there was no nail to put it upon, I put it in the corner by my side; in the evening I went down and forgot to put it in my pocket.
Q. Did you leave any body at work when you went away? - There was only the prisoner and me at work; just before we went away my mistress came up stairs, the prisoner asked her to lend him two shillings; she told him she had not got two shillings, she would let him have eighteen-pence, I had got on my shoes, he was buckling up his shoes; I went down first, my mistress followed me, and he followed her last; as soon as she came to the bottom of the stairs, she begged we would both come to work early in the morning as the work was in a great hurry; we said we would sooner than usual; as soon as I got out into Saville-street I says to the prisoner, I forgot to take my watch: we had some discourse about it; I said I suppose it will be safe enough by the morning; there are two young men, says he, that sleeps in the room, they will swear it is a death watch in the night; we went on all the way through Leicester-fields together; this was the Monday evening which was our club night in Long-acre, and there he said he had got a pair of scissurs grinding at Russel-court, says he, if you will go to the club I will come there presently; he went away, and I went to the house of call, and found he did not come; I related the circumstance to some young men that were there, they said they were afraid I was done out of my watch; I got up early in the morning and went to work, and I asked one of the young men if they had seen my watch that I had left the last night?
Q. Did you find your watch there? - No, I asked them if they had let that irishman come and take away the watch? they said no, he had not been back.
Q. Were they in the room when you went away? - No, The prisoner never came back to the place afterwards, left the house of call, and never was seen afterwards till I took him up for this, when I was carrying some clothes home for my master last Saturday fortnight, this that I speak of was on the 6th of May, I was in the London-road, St. George's-fields, just before we came to the Romish Chapel, the man and me run against each other, I put my hand against his breast to prevent him running against me, and I recollected his face again, I said, how do you do my friend? don't you recollect when you and me worked together inSaville-court? he said, yes; do not you recollect that I left my watch there? he said, yes; and don't you recollect that you took it away from me? he then said he would make me pay for charging him with a robbery in the street, and he asked me why I detained him? I told him I should not let him go till we had a hearing before a magistrate; this was Saturday evening, I could not get a constable, and he said he would be damned if I should put him into the watch-house, and keep him there all night, if I had any charge against him he would go to any magistrate with me, he would go to Bow-street or any where; I told him it was too late; at last he consented to go to a constable with me, and we went on, and I met a young man who assisted me, and we took him to a lock up house, facing the New Goal in the Borough, and when I got there I gave charge of him, and related the story, and he was examined, and asked where he worked? and he told two or three different stories, and they said they were sure he was guilty; at last I had a coach and brought him to St. Andrew's watch-house, and gave charge of him at the watch-house, and the watchmen searched his pockets; in his pocket was found several duplicates and a piece of a chain of a watch; I told him that piece of a chain belonged to my watch; he said I was a damned liar, for he had it given him in Birmingham a year and a half ago; among the duplicates was found the duplicate of one watch; one of the officers belonging to St. Andrew's watch-house went with me to the pawnbroker's to examine, but the watch was not mine; we came back to St. Andrew's watch-house, and gave charge of him and he was taken to Giltspur-street Compter, On Sunday some woman came to my lodging and said, if I would go to Giltspur-street Compter, I might hear of my watch; when I came home my landlord told me; I said it was too late that night; I went in the morning; when I came he said he only sent for me to know what the devil I meant by leaving him there; I told him he must stay till he had a hearing, and so I parted from him; when we went to Guildhall his wife came to me and said if I would not hurt her husband she would tell me where the watch was; the woman that went with me, took me to the house of this gentleman Mr. Barney of Old Lukener's-lane; when I came there Mr. Barney was not at home; the woman and me went to Bow-street; I had a warrant to search the lodging, but we could not find it there; Mr. Barney heard of it, and came on Tuesday morning and delivered up the watch.
Prisoner. Ask him when he went to work the next morning, whether there was not one of the men gone out of the room that sleeps in the room? - There was.

             sworn.
I know the prisoner, he came to me and sold the duplicate of a warch; I met him about a fortnight or three weeks before this time that he came with this gentleman's watch, he told me that he was in distress for money, because work was slack; accordingly I agreed with him as reasonable as I could, advanced him so much money on the duplicate, to the best of my knowledge I believe it was about half a guinea, and it was pawned for a guinea; and about a fortnight after he came and he said he had another watch that was a better watch than the first I had of him, and he would make a swap for another guinea; I told him that I could not afford to give him a guinea; says he, but this one is better that I have got; it looks better says I, but I am no judge; then at last I gave him this first watch back again for this young man's watch, and Igave fifteen shillings in boot at five shillings a week; the girl that he lived with came to me on Sunday, and asked me for some money; I did not give her any. On Monday the constable came up, and I was over the water in the afternoon, I sent two men down to this young man's place to tell him that I would advance the property; the next morning I went down in person myself, and advanced the property, and went to Guildhall.
Q. Are you sure that you had it of him or the girl? - I had it of him, I knew him about six weeks before.

             sworn.
I have got the watch; Mr. Barney delivered it to me, I have had it in my custody ever since. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor having had it three years, and knowing the number 3,942, and the maker's name Edwards.)
Gurrier. In his pocket I found six or seven duplicates, and a piece of chain which the prosecutor says that he could swear to, by a mark.
Prisoner. When I was going to work the next morning, I went to work very early, I met this man who slept in the room, one of the men who lodge in the room in which he left his watch; he took me and gave me two or three pots of beer, and he gave me this watch, either to sell or pawn for what I could get for it; I took the watch, I went down to this man's place and shewed it him, says he to me will you sell the watch? says I, it is not mine, says he, I will stand every rig of that sort, I don't care how you came by it, if I can get a bargain; he said he would give fifteen shillings and another that he had taken out of pawn before to boot, and I had sold him the duplicate, I went and advanced the fifteen shillings down to the man, and I told him I would pay him the rest at proper times; we kept drinking till it was too late to go to work, indeed I was not fit, and the next day I knew there was another man put on in my room.
Court to How. Upon your oath did you give him this watch to pawn for you? - Never.
Prisoner. It was not him that gave it me, it was the man that slept in the room, there were two single men who slept in the same room where he left his watch, lodgers.
Court to How. How long had he worked there? - I never worked there but that day before I lost my watch, I took the call that morning, he came there the Friday before.

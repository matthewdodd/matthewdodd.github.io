            . She lives at Bow by Stratford. They were hanging with other things to dry in the garden. I went out for a pint of beer, coming back, I had a full view of all the lines in my garden. I saw the prisoner under the line, and a shift that had hung there, was drawn off. She clapped it under her gown, and hugged it up close. I followed her to her own door. She denied it, and I could not get the things again.
Prisoner's defence.
I am innocent of the thing. I never saw the things in my life. I have been many times in her garden She has bid me come in, when my hens were there, to drive them out.
To her character.

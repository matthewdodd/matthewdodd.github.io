            . I keep a cheesemonger's-shop
 in Fetter-lane


, I was sitting in a little room behind my shop, on the 21st of January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening: there was a gammon of bacon hung up against the wall; the prisoner at the bar came in and took it, and was going out of the shop. I got up and push'd out after him, and laid hold of him before he got thirty yards from the door. He had it under his arm, then he drop'd it, and got out of my hands and ran away: I cry'd out, stop thief ! and he was stop'd in running about 150 yards, but I was close by his heels all the way He was never out of my sight.

            . I am constable. I was charg'd with the prisoner. He cry'd and made a heavy to do, desiring I would let him go.



               Guilty
            .
The prisoner had given his evidence last sessions against two of his accomplices, See No. 154, 155, 115. 116. He had been released out of confinement but about an hour before he committed this fact.

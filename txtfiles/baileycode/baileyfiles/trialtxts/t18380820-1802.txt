1802. 




JOHN WILDEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of July, I saw, value 3s., the goods of 



Jacob Cleal; and 1 plane, value 4., the goods of 



Henry Relfe: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JACOB CLEAL
. I am a carpenter, and work at a shop at Euston-square. On the 13th of July I went out, leaving my saw there—I saw the prisoner at the gate-when I came back my saw was gone—I pursued and found him in about five minutes—I charged him with stealing the saw—he said he had not—I found it under his arm.





HENRY RELFE
. I work at the same place. I lost a plane, which has not been found.

Prisoner. I was up by the railway, and met a man, who asked me to go and get a bag of shavings for him and a little saw—I went and got the saw, but the man was not there—I could not get the shavings—I told the man I had it, and showed it him. Witness. No; he said he knew nothing of it.





WILLIAM MONK
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former

conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried and convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

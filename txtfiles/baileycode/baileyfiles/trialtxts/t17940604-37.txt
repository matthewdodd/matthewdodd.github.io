                  Q. 
               


            When did you write in? - About the latter end of the year 1792.
Q. You have seen it several times since? - I have, it was brought to me in my business as a schoolmaster, by a person of the name of Thomas Bothwick, not this man.
Q. Did you write this from his dictating, or from a copy of a paper? - From a copy.
Q. The name Andrew Bowman, John Wood, and Thomas Gardiner, are not your hand writing? - They are not, the whole is my hand writing besides.


                  Q. 
               


            What had you for doing this? - Two shillings; I thought I had earned it.
Mr. Alby. You say you are a school-master? - Yes.

Q. You swear that you wrote this in the year 1792? - Yes.
Q. You did not know the prisoner at the bar when you saw him afterwards, I believe when you was brought to Bow-street you saw somebody? - I was very well convinced of the person that brought it to me.
Q. What part of the year 1792? - At the latter end, I will not be exact to a month, as near as I can charge my mind, it was about November.


                  Q. 
               


            Might it not have been as well in the beginning of the year 1793? - It might have so happened.
Court. The paper was brought you to copy? Do you recollect whether there were any names to that paper that was brought to you to copy? - I cannot recollect at this distance of time.
Q. If a paper was brought to you to copy, and there were names to it, is it your habit to add the names if the copy was without? - No, most certainly not.

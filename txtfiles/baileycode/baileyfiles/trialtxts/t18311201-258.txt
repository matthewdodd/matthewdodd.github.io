            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner on the 17th of November, on account of her having sold my wife a duplicate; while we were at the office the prosecutor came, and claimed the apron, and afterwards the shoes which the prisoner wore: she at first denied that the apron was the prosecutrix's, but when she claimed the shoes she said she had lent them to her.

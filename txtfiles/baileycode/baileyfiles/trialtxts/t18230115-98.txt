             was his labourer
; his spade was stolen on the 9th of December, from the bottom of the orchard, which is fenced round; I saw it safe at noon, and found it about three weeks after, at the charity school, I knew it to be Bolding's, the prisoner who lives in the neighbourhood was brought to Mr. Pounce's house, by the officer.

            . My mother keeps the charity-school. I bought this spade of the prisoner, on the 15th of December, for 18 d.; Bolding afterwards claimed it; the prisoner said he had had it a good while, and gave 2 s. for it.

EDWARD BROWN. I am a clerk to John Gadsden, of Oxford-street


, cheesemonger
. On the evening of the 3rd of December, between six and seven o'clock, I missed a ham from the board in front of his window - this is it; I know it by a mark on it.

            . I am a Policeman. On the evening of the 3rd of December I was on duty in Oxford-street, and heard an alarm; I ran to Duke-street, saw the prisoner running, and pursued him to Henrietta-street - he was carrying something before him, but I could not see what; I overtook him in Bird-street - he dropped something in a cloth, which proved to be this ham.

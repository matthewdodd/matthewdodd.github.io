JAMES HARVEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of February, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 




Andrew Stewart, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANDREW STEWART
. I keep a coffee-shop in High-Street, Wapping. On the 5th of February I was standing at the print-shop at Cornhill—I had a handkerchief in my pocket just before—I had seen it less than five minutes before—I received information from Parcell—I turned round and seized the prisoner, and accused him of picking my pocket—he pulled out my handkerchief and gave it to me, and begged I would let him go.





THOMAS PARCELL
. I am a newsvender—I was at this shop, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket—I gave

information—the prosecutor turned round and caught the prisoner—he denied having it at first, but after that pulled it out, gave it to the gentleman, and said it was his handkerchief.





WILLIAM MONTGOMERY
 (police-sergeant F 4.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 24.—


Transported for Ten Years.

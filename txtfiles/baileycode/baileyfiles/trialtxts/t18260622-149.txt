SUSANNAH HEBDEN. I am single, and live with my mother, at Poplar


. On Saturday, the 27th of May, my gown hung to dry in the wharf, opposite the house; I saw it safe at a quarter past one o'clock, and missed it in about five minutes; I heard, in about ten minutes, that it was at the watch-house - I went there, and found it in Williams' possession.

            . I am a labourer, and live at Limehouse. I was at Sir Charles Price's premises, at Poplar, on the 27th of May; I heard an alarm, came out, and saw the prisoner, in about five minutes after, in custody of some workmen - he struggled very much, and I assisted - I saw his hat taken off, and this gown was in it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down by the canal- there was a piece of work, and I was detained; a gentleman said he saw me take something from under the logs, and I had not. I had found the gown, and had it in my hat.

JOHN MORGAN. I live in James-street, Bedford-row. On the 10th of February, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was going home; as I passed the Sheriff's office, at the top of Bedford-row


 - I felt a pull at my great-coat pocket; I instantly turned round, the prisoner was at my elbow. I missed my handkerchief, and seized him, took him to a shop door, at the corner of Hand-court, just at that moment, a gentleman said here is what you lost; the gentleman picked up my handkerchief, about a yard and a half from the prisoner. I had not taken him twenty yards from where I missed it; nobody had passed the place but him-it is impossible any body but him, could have taken it - I had felt it safe as I crossed Brownlow-street - I felt him take it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I passed the gentleman, he took hold of me. 

               GUILTY

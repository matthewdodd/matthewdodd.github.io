            . I lodged at the same house with the prisoner - he slept in the same room with Cliff, not with me; I missed a pair of breeches and a pair of garters from a press in the room he slept in - these are my breeches.

            . I slept with the prisoner on the 5th of March; I went out in the morning, and left him in bed with another man - I returned at eight o'clock, and missed these three handkerchiefs.

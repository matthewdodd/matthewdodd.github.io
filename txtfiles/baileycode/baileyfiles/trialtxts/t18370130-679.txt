FASNY BLAIR
. I live at Deptford New-town, and am a widow. These things were mine, and taken out of a shed opposite my kitchen door, In my yard—Smith came there on the Friday, and the basket and bottles were stolen on the Saturday—I did not see them again till the Sunday—these are my bottles, and this is my basket, I know it by its make, and being broken at the side—I think I lost about two dozen bottles.





JOHN REESE
 (police-constable R 79.) On Saturday, the 28th of last month, I saw the prisoner Hart in the shop of Mr. Roberts, High-street, Deptford, selling these bottles, and the other prisoner outside toe door—that is about ten minutes walk from Mrs. Blair's.





JOHN ROBERTS
. Between eight and nine o'clock, Hart came into my shop with some bottles—I bought three small ones of him—he had seven or eight more, which I would not have, and he took them away with him—I did not see the other prisoner.





JAMES PARRY
 (police-sergeant R 8.) I received information of this on Sunday—I went to Smith's lodgings, and took him in bed—I found the basket and bottles in the yard—he said he had sold the rest to Mr. Roberts—I then went and took Hart—he denied all knowledge of the basket and bottles, and said he had not sold any to Mr. Roberts.

Hart. When he went to Mr. Roberta's, he said I was not so tall a boy. Witness. Yes, that was the case—on Sunday morning, Roberts said he was not so tall, and he had a light great coat on.





JOHN ROBERTS

re-examined. I was very ill, and when I came down I said I thought Mart was not the boy, but when I saw him again, I knew he was the boy.

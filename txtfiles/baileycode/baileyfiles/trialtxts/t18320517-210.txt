            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. I was walking in Old-street


 on the 13th of April, between one and two o'clock; I thought I felt something - I put my hand down, and my handkerchief was gone; I saw the prisoner rolling it up, and putting it into his bosom - I took hold of him, and gave him into custody; he said, "It is not yours."

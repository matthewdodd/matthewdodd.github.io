            . I live at Hampstead


; these things were in my drawer in the front parlour, on the 18th of December. The prisoner had nursed my child, but I had not seen her this two years. I found her under the bed; my window was pushed up, and the shutters open; she was searched, and the gown found under her arm, and the shawl in her pocket.

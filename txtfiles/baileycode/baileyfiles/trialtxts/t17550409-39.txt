Elisabeth Arnold. We live at Kentish-town; I am wife to the prosecutor; the prisoner was my servant
 (she produced the things mentioned in the indictment) these things were missing after the prisoner was gone away; we found her and took her up, and before justice Fielding she confessed she stole them at divers times, and directed us where to find them, which we did.
The prisoner owned the fact.

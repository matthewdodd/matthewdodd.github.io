            . I live in St. Anne's-lane, Aldersgate-street; I was on Tower-hill


 on the 23d of July, the day the red regiment marched out, about eleven o'clock; a person tapped me on the shoulder, and said, Sir, here is a boy has picked your pocket of your handkerchief; he had the prisoner by the arm; I felt, and missed it; some people were for horse-whipping him, some were for ducking him; I said, neither of them shall be done, I will take him to justice; I took him to a magistrate, and he was committed.

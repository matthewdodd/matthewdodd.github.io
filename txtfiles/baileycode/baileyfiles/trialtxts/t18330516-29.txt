            . I am a cheesemonger
, and have one partner, we live in Cromer-street


. On the evening of the 16th of April, I was informed a man had taken a cheese, I proceeded down the street, and took the prisoner with it on his head - he was quite a stranger - he said some one gave it him to carry; this is it - it had been in a cart at my door - I had sent some cheeses to Smithfield for a gentleman to look at - my brother brought this and several others back in the cart.
Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for a place, and a man asked me to carry this cheese to the bottom of Cromer-street, or to Mr. Cubitts; I thought the man was on the other side of the way.

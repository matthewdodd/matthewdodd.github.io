John Beard. On Monday the 10th of March, about noon, as I was going under Newgate


, I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, and at the same instant a person called to me, and told me I was robbed. I turned about and saw the prisoner, and a handkerchief in his hand, and saw it fall to the ground.
Q. Did you feel him take it?
Beard. No, I neither saw nor felt the prisoner take it; I saw it in his possession.

            . I was going through Newgate on the 10th of March about twelve o'clock; the prosecutor and the prisoner were before me; I saw the boy snatch a handkerchief out of the prosecuter's pocket; I took hold of his arm, and he dropt the handkerchief, after I had hold of him, on the ground.

            . I am constable; I had the prisoner in custody, and while we were in the matted gallery at Guildhall, he owned he picked the gentleman's pocket of this handkerchief; also he owned to me in the Compter, that he used to deliver what handkerchiefs he stole to one

            , and he used to sell them to a person that lodged at a shoe-maker's shop in Chick-lane; the prisoner was released out of custody but the Friday before.
Prisoner's defence.
I never confessed anything to that witness.

I went after the prisoner—I saw him, and called after him by name—he said, "My name is George Williams"—I said he must go with me to Mr. Greenly's—he said he did not know him—I said, "Don't you know him?"—he said, "He is a pawnbroker, but I never was in his shop"—I took him to the shop, and the witness said he was the man who brought the tools.

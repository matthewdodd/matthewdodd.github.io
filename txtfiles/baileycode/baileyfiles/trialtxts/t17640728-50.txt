                  Crook 
               



             took the Crown Tavern at Cripplegate


. I wanted an apartment to put my goods in; so I had two rooms at that house. He was to have workmen come to repair it; he desired me to go to Mr. Denton's, in Grey's-Inn-lane, where he had a lodging, to lie with his wife: he said he would take care of my goods; I thought my goods were very safe; I carried them to the Crown Tavern: this was about March, 1762.
Q. What things did you carry?
M. Adderley. I carried a clock and case, a bureau chest of drawers, a bed and bedding, and the things mentioned in the indictment: I put them into two rooms, that I was to have, when they were repaired; then I went to his lodging at Mr. Denton's, by his directions, and he lay in my room: he came home on the sabbath-day, before I missed my goods, and dined with his family; and told me every thing was safe; and on the Tuesday after I went there, and Mr. Crook's servant set a ladder and got over, and opened the great door; I went in, and found the padlock that fastened the door lying in the window, and the key in it; my door was open; I had trusted that key with Mr. Crook; the other keys of my drawers and places I had in my pocket, all but two; I let him have a key of one drawer, as he said he wanted that drawer to lay some papers in: I found my drawers open; one of my locks was entirely off; my book-case was wide open; the drawers were forced open; there lay two chissels, one was broke, and the other not: all the things were taken out of the drawers. I went into the other room; there I found my locks broke, and all the goods mentioned in the indictment were gone, (mentioning them by name): then I went and got Mrs. Brabiner to go with me again to see the rooms.
Q. When was this?
M. Adderley. This was in 1762, I can't tell exactly the month; it was about November. I advertised directly, and Mr. Wild, a pawnbroker in Aldersgate-street, where some of my goods were pledged, sent to me; and I took a constable, and went and saw them: the constable took an account of every thing: there was pewter, brass, linen, a gown, and a petticoat, part of the goods mentioned in the indictment: I found no more of the goods than what I found there.
Cross Examination.
Q. How long had you been acquainted with Mr. Crook?
M. Adderley. I had been acquainted with him about half a year before my goods were there.
Q. Was you arrested at the suit of one Bigget?
Adderley. I was.
Q. Who lent you the money to pay?
Adderley. There was no money paid at all.
Q. Who was your bail?
Adderley. 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             was.
Q. Did you ever give 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             liberty to pledge any of your goods?
Adderley. He had a gold watch of me, and he was to deliver it to me in three days, but he never did deliver it me again; he never had liberty of me to pawn any of those goods.
Q. Did you never give him the keys to go and pledge them?
Adderley. No.
Q. Did you never give him a letter of attorney?
Adderley. I did, but not to rob me; I gave him a letter of attorney, to receive money for 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Adderley 
               



            , (that was not my husband); it was to receive money in partnership, in the way of trade.
Q. What money was coming to you?
Adderley. Mr. Adderley told me there was coming to me 900 l. as near as I can remember and I trusted him with this letter of attorney to receive it.
Q. Look at this letter of attorney.
Adderley. (She takes it in her hand) This name of mine is my own hand writing; I gave it so as to receive it myself: I was against making a letter of attorney; I did not understand the nature of it; Crook is now indebted to me.
Q. Was that letter of attorney read over to you?
Adderley. I am sure it was not at that time.
Q. Do you remember being before Justice Girdler?
Adderley. I do; that was within a week or a fortnight after I was robbed; he sent Crook to Clerkenwell prison; then I went the next day to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, and was examined by Sir John.
Q. Did you tell him the same you have here?
Adderley. I did; and Mr. Girdler too: I told the truth, and I told no more.
Q. Did you not say at Sir John's, you gave Mr. Crook liberty to pawn the goods?
Adderley. No, I did not.
Q. Had you not part of the money that was raised upon these goods?
Adderley. I never in my life had part of the money.
Q. Did you, at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's or at any other time, tell any body you had part of the money they were pawned for?
Adderley. No, I never did.
Q. Did you not tell Mr. Mason so?
Adderley. I never told Mr. Mason so.
Q. Was not Mr. Crook discharged at Mr. Fielding's?
Adderley. He had a great many friends, and I had none; they told me he was discharged, and I was to appear at some of the halls; I did not understand that.
Q. Was you at Mr. Fielding's when Mr. Crook was there, on a second accusation?
Adderley. I was.
Q. What was done there?
Adderley. I gave upon oath, that my goods were gone, and I understood by the justices, that I should never have my goods again.
Q. Did the justices tell you they did not think it a felony, and discharged him?
Adderley. They discharged him, but I cannot give any account why. Whenever I came to Mr. Crook, he talked to me in a good-natured way, and said, I should have my goods again; and at last, he called me old b - h, and said, I should have none of them: if I would have them, I might fetch them myself, for he would not.
Q. When was you with Mr. Gascoyne?
Adderley. I was with him the 30th of June last.
Bamber Gascoyne, Esq; On the 30th of June last, Mrs. 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



             came down to Essex, to my house, and there laid an information against 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



            , who was then a resident and house-keeper, in the town where I live; she told her story much as she has told it now; she mentioned several things that were lost, and that she had found some things at Mr. Wild's, and that they were pawned by 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             there. She said, that Mr. Wild and his servant had sworn they were pawned by him; and she had taken two warrants out against him: one she executed, and the other she could not; and that she never had any of her goods back again. Among other things she said, the keys of those drawers that were broke open, she had in her pocket, but the key of her lodging-room door was with Crook. I granted a warrant to apprehend him, but he could not be taken. On the Sunday, she came to me again, and begged I would grant a search-warrant to search his house; I granted her one, as she said she had some grounds to think some of her goods were in his house: the house was searched, but there were no goods of her's, or very little of any goods found in his house. On the Friday, when I was in London, at my lodgings, I had word brought me, 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             was there; I found it was the prisoner charged with felony. I said, I did not chuse to see such a person at my lodgings, I not being a justice of peace for the county of Middlesex. On the Saturday was sennight following, 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             came to my house, in Essex, and surrendered; then I read over the information to him; he said, he had surrendered before, to the justices in Middlesex, Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and others, and he had been discharged there; but as neither a copy of the information made before me, had been sent for, I thought it my duty not to credit such a thing as that, but to proceed upon the information laid by 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



            : he said the goods were taken, but put it upon a civil suit, a breach of trust; he admitted the taking the goods: I said, what do you say to the drawers that were locked by the woman, in which these goods were, and that you had not the keys trusted with you: he said, if I would not commit him that night, he would bring down evidence to shew, that 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



             trusted him with them keys: also he offered me some bail, which I would not take: I said, as it was an affair of two years standing, I would permit him to stay in custody of the constable, till he should send to his friends, or bail. He said he would bring 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



             in the morning, that would own she delivered the keys to him, and other friends. On the Sunday morning. Mr. Denton and 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



             came to me, and by what 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             had said, I thought she would retract from what she had said before; but upon calling her in, she stood to her information, word for word, as before. The prisoner produced me a note, which was to shew, that 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



             had received satisfaction for the goods, to shew that would bring it to a civil suit. It was in these words, or to this purport:
"April 1, 1763, I do
"hereby acknowledge, that I have this day received
"of Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Adney 
               



            , as security, for
"repaying me what the goods and effects of mine
"that Mr. 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             has pawned, may amount
"unto, together with interest for the same;
"which, when paid, will be satisfaction of such
"my claim upon the said 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



            ,
"
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



            ."
Mr. Denton produced me this discharge: he produced me this paper, which she acknowledged to be her hand-writing: I asked her if she knew what this was? she said, no: she thought it was a security for the goods: it is dated June 9, and the information was not till July 30: she said, it was wrote at the justice of peace's, and she never intended he should be discharged from my warrant: Mr. Denton produced it, and the woman said she did not know the contents of it. (He reads it.)
"June 9, 1764. Honoured Sir, I do hereby,
"desire your worship will be kind enough to
"discharge the warrant against Mr. Francis
"Crook, I having had him before Sir John
"Fielding, and 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Kynaston 
               



            , Esq; to answer
"to my complaint, and was discharged the
"same, as on the 17th of June, 1763, I having
"a security under Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Adney 
               



            's hand,
"for my goods, pawned by the said Francis
"Crook, as witness my hand, this 12th day of
"July, 1764.
"
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



            ."
There had been great pains taken before, that my warrant should be discharged; every step had been taken that it should not be before me: she produced a paper, dated April 1, 1763; the contents were,
"I do hereby undertake to pay to Mrs.
"Adderley, whatever sum or sums, the several
"goods of her's that are pawned by Mr. Francis
"Crook, together with interest for the same,
"shall amount to, as soon as the East-India annuities
"belonging to the said Francis shall be transferred
"to me.
"
               
                  Thomas 
                  Adney 
               



            ."

Upon the prisoner owning the fact, and upon seeing those kind of securities, I asked the woman about it; she said, they had stopped her, as she had been to prefer a bill of indictment two or three times; and that she had been there, but the grand jury was discharged. She was in hopes to have got her goods again, which were all she had in the world: but she found she was bubbled in every light; and hearing he was come down there, she came down after him. I then asked her over again, and she swor e directly as she has now. I finding they were for putting it as a matter of a breach of trust, I thought the whole of it was matter proper for the enquiry of the country; and as Mr. Denton brought sufficient bail, I admitted him to bail: the woman was always uniform and constant in her story.


                  Thomas 
                  Brabiner 
               



            . Mrs. Adderley came to me, about the middle of Nov. 1762, and said she had been robbed; her goods were all gone from the Crown Tavern; she cried, and said she had no body to take her part. I went with her to her rooms; the door was open, the lock lay in the window, and the key in it: there lay a chisel that seemed to fit the places, where the drawers were forced open; after that, she desired I would go with her to the pawnbroker's; we found some of her things pawned in Aldersgate-street, things that she mentioned to have lost, such as aprons, shifts, sheets, &c.


                  Sarah 
                  Brabiner 
               



            . Mrs. Adderley came to me the morning she lost her things, and cry'd, and said she had lost a great many things, and begged I would go with her to the apartment. I went with her; the place looked in a great deal of confusion; the padlock lay in the window, and the drawers were open; and at going to every drawer, she repeated the loss of several things.


                  John 
                  Caterer 
               



            . The first time I saw Mrs. Adderly, she was brought by Mrs. Brabiner to my house; I then kept a coffee-house by Cripplegate, but now I live at the Crown Tavern: she complained she had had her goods taken from her; and her locks and drawers broke open: she said, she would go and lie where the goods had been, but I persuaded her not; she took a lodging with me, and brought the rest of her goods, such as a clock, book-case, and drawers, to my house.


                  William 
                  Wilmat 
               



            . I live at Mr. Wild's, a pawnbroker, in Aldersgate-street. I applied to Mrs. Adderley to let her know, upon her advertising, that part of her goods were at our house; those things were pledged by 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



            , the prisoner, between the 6th of September, and the 9th of October, 1762. (Produced in court). Here is a list of them; (He reads it.) A diamond ring, two table-cloths, two aprons, twenty napkins, a jack, a quilt, a gown, two shifts, a spoon, two sheets, two curtains, a petticoat, a valence, a pair of breeches, eighteen plates, a water plate, seven dishes, a pair of candle-sticks, a brass mortar, two brass arms, a tobacco-box, a seal, two books, and two remnants of silk; they came in sixteen parcels, and were pledged for 6 l. 13 s. in the whole.
Adderley. These goods are all my property, and were taken out of the rooms; the diamond ring, quilt, gown, shifts, napkins, tablecloths, petticoat, counterpane, and spoon, were the same, and were all under lock and key, and I had the key in my pocket.
Q. Did you use to lie in the lodgings?
Adderley. Yes, but very little; I did not look into my drawers every time I came there.


                  John 
                  Holmes 
               



            . On the 28th of February, 1763, I was constable; Mrs. Adderley brought me a warrant granted by Sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Asgill 
               



             to search the house of Mr. Wild; I did not execute the warrant that afternoon, but I went the next day, being the first of March, and informed Mr. Wild I had a search-warrant against him; he told me Mrs. Adderley had been there several times about her things, and complained she had been greatly distressed; he had given her a gown and petticoat out: I took his word to bring every thing down that 
               
                  Francis 
                  Crook 
               



             had pledged there. Every parcel, as they were opened, she owned to be her property, and I took an inventory of them. Mr. Wild, Mr. Wilmot, she and I, all went to the sitting alderman together, which was Sir 
               
                  Robert 
                  Kite 
               



            : Sir Robert and I saw very plain that the woman was a very ignorant woman; she thought if she took up Francis Crook, she had no more to do, but to have her goods: the alderman told her she must take him up, and bring him to justice, and then, very probably, she might have her goods again.


                  Thomas 
                  Morton 
               



            . The time Mrs. Adderley came to the house, the door was locked up, so that we could not get into the tavern; she asked my master or mistress for a ladder to get up to open the door: my fellow-servant and I got a ladder, and got over the leads, and let her in, to go to her own rooms.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never denied taking the things in my life: she gave me the keys, and it was with her consent all that I did take; but half the things in the indictment I never saw: she had part of the money; I gave her a proper security, and kept and supported her for some time.
For the Prisoner.
Mr. Mason. I have known Mrs. Adderley two years. I remember preparing a letter of attorney from her to Mr. Crook, for him to receive money for her; I am a subscribing witness to it, together with Mr. Winbolt; it was read over and explained to her word by word. She, Mr. Winbolt, and Mr. Crook, came to my chambers on that account: she came to my chambers a second time; I had it read over very distinctly to her; it was duly executed, and she signed her name to it. I am well persuaded she understood every word contained in it; I read it over very distinctly in March 1763. Some time after she lost her things, she came to my chambers, and said she would have her papers containing the accounts with Mr. Cotrell; I said, you have my three guineas, pay me my money, I don't want to be concerned with such people as you: said she, Mr. Crook shall pay you, and takes and sweeps all the papers into her apron, and would take them away; she said she would have them; I said, you shall not have the letter of attorney, and insisted she should not have that, and that she let me have again, and I would particularly exempt that in the receipt which she proposed to give me. At this time, she told me she had lost a great variety of things; he had much more than the value of the three guineas; I think she said, he had pawned the things, and she had part of the money, either then or at another time. A person had arrested her, and thrown her into the Poultry-Compter: Mr. Crook came and told me of it, and I believe he got bail for her, and she was discharged; this was in 1762, about June or July: she admitted to me that he had paid money for her, to obtain her discharge. She came to me on the 18th of March, 1763, and I think that was the time she admitted he had part of the money: she declared to me at the time she had her papers away, that she never had heard this letter of attorney read over.
Q. What do you think of her capacity, as to her knowledge of the letter of attorney?
Mason. I read it over so distinctly, because I thought she might not be so well aware of it; but all things considered, I apprehend she knew what she was about very well.
Mr. Denton. There was one Brown left 650 l. in East-India annuities to Mr. Crook, and there being some contest in the commons about it, he was perplexed, and by that means his pocket was drained of every thing, and I lent him money: after that, he gave a bond to Mr. Adney, and Mr. Adney lent him money to carry on the cause: this was on the 17th of December, 1762. I saw those annuities in the book, in the East-India house, and I was informed of Mr. Crook being taken up by Mr. Girdler: I desired he might be examined again, and Mr. Girdler thought proper to have another magistrate in the affair, which was Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding

             were there, she acknowledged she had given him the key, and had given him leave to pawn things, and she received part of the money: this she acknowledged to me several times.
Q. What key did you understand that to be?
Denton. I understood it to be the key of her drawers.
Q. What were the words she made use of?
Denton. I cannot be particular as to the words; I apprehend she meant these goods she complained of.
Mrs. Adderley. I let him pawn some spoons once for 6 s. when I wanted money; but I did not give him leave to break open my drawers, or to pawn any of these things.
Denton. Mr. Crook has behaved exceeding well, and surrendered voluntarily at Mr. Fieldings; if I had not thought him an honest man, I would not have become one of his bail.
Mr. Cotrell. I know 
               
                  Martha 
                  Adderley 
               



            ; I look upon her to be a vile peevish old woman.
Adderley. You know I never could get you to settle your account with me.
Mr. Thorowgood. About two years ago, Mrs. Adderley came to me, and we agreed to go to a public-house. Said she, I could be glad to have my goods again that Mr. Crook has pawned: I gave him the key to open the drawers, where he took out some things, and pawned them: there was a gold watch, a gold ring, and a pair of sheets: she did agree to have done with it, if Mr. Crook would let her have her things again, but it was out of his power to fetch them.
Mr. Brooks. I saw Mrs. Adderley about this time twelve months, in Moor-fields, just after Mr. Crook was taken before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; (I was clerk to Mr. Denton): I asked her concerning it, and she said, it was entirely owing to other people's persuasions that she prosecuted.
Mr. Mason (again). I have known Mr. Crook two years; I believe he bears a very good character; I never heard to the contrary.

Mr. Hancock, that had known him six years, Mr. Hodson about three years. 
               
                  Henry 
                  Warpool 
               



             about a year and a half, and Mr. Midwinter about twenty years, gave him the character of an honest man.

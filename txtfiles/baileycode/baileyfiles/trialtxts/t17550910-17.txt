            . The prisoner was servant
 to me about two months. About the 18th of August last I miss'd several things of value out of my house; I charged her with them; she owned she had pawn'd them; I fetch'd them home , and turn'd her away. After she was gone I miss'd these two harrateen curtains ; I took her up, and ask'd her about them; and she told me she had pawn'd them at Mr. Clements's; I went there, and found them accordingly. (Produced in court, and deposed to).
The pawnbroker's servant deposed, he lent the prisoner 3 s. 6 d. on the curtains.

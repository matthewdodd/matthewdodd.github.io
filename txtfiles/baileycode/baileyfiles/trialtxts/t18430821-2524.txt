Prisoner. I was in Whitechapel-road—Jackson called me, and asked me to lend him a hand to shove the truck down to the turnpike, and he would stand two or three pots of beer—I said, "What have you got?" he said, "Marble chimney-pieces to pawn, at Mrs. Avila's"—I lent him a hand, and he pawned them.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

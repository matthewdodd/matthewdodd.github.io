SAMUEL BATES
. I live in Houndsditch, nearly opposite Mr. Payne, who

is a cheesemonger. On the 5th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door—I saw the prisoner go to the truck at Mr. Payne's door, take a side of bacon out, and run away with it 'down a passage by the side of my house—he could not get out—he turned into a passage of a house, threw it down, and came out—I collared him—he said, "Let me go, I have done nothing"—I would not, and then he began to show fight, and abused me, but I took him into the shop.





HENRY CURTIS PAYNE
. This is my bacon—it was in the truck at my door.





JAMES ACKERS
. I took life prisoner—he made great resistance.

Prisoner. I was tipsy, and did not know any thing about it. 


GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

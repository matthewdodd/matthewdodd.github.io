            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 10th of February, at half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Kensal-green-lane, on the Harrow-road, about three miles from Wilsden: we heard footsteps coming down the lane - my partner went out and took Briscoe; I seized another person, and said, "What have you got here?" he ran across the road - I pursued, and took him; he dropped a bag with these two fowls in it - he got away, and run off; I returned to my partner, and took Hoare - the two prisoners and the other man were together; Briscoe said if the other man had stood as firm as he did, we should not have taken them; I shewed two of the fowls that were in the bag to Mrs. Berry, and she claimed them.

            . I was with Argust - we heard footsteps, and saw three men coming down the lane following each other close - I went up to Briscoe, and asked what was in his bag - he said linen, and he was going to Paddington to work - I put my hand to the bag, and found it was bloody; I took hold of him - Hoare was by his side, but did not offer to go away; he kept sideling about till my partner took him.

            . I am a widow, and live at Kilburn



. The officer shewed the fowls to me, two of them are mine - I know them; the thieves had got through a cow-house and then to the fowl-house - they had taken the cow-house door off the hinges; I do not know that I had seen the prisoners before; I had seen my fowls all safe on the afternoon of the 9th of February about four o'clock - Mrs. Medwin lives about half a mile from me.(Property produced and sworn to.)
HOARE'S Defence. I was coming down the road with these men, a man overtook us, and asked this man to carry a bundle; the officer met us, and asked what he had got - he said clothes, he supposed.
BRISCOE'S Defence. I said the rogue had run away who asked me to carry them.

            . I stopped the prisoners on the 10th of February - they were in company with another person; Briscoe had a bag with these six fowls in it - the two were dropped by the man who got away; as we were taking them, Briscoe said if the other had stood as firm as they did there would have been bloodshed before we should have taken them.

            . I was with Argust; what he has stated is correct; Hoare said if he had got his liberty as the other did, he would have had a dozen to rescue them before we got to Paddington.

            . I am single
, and live at Kilburn, about half a mile farther from London than Berry. The officers shewed me these six fowls, which I know to be mine; they had been taken from Mr. Frogget's hen-house - I had locked them up at six o'clock in the evening, and the next morning they were gone; the lock of the hen-house had been forced from the door; I heard the cock crow between eight and nine o'clock at night - they must have been taken after that.

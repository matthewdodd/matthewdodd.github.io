HENRY MARTIN. I was in Piccadilly


 on the 15th of November, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, passing where the houses are being pulled down. I felt some person pull the tail of my coat, I put my hand down, missed my handkerchief, turned round, and found the prisoner at my elbow, in great confusion, putting the handkerchief under his waistcoat. I collared him - He said I had mistaken the person. I took him into a shop to search him. As I was going in at the door, he took it out and threw it on the pavement-he begged for mercy.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

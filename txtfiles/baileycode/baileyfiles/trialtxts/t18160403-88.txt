            . I am a stationer; I live in Token-house-yard, Lothbury. On the 27th of February, at about half after four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the end of Buckler's Bury


, in company with several others. I observed the prisoner attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket. I crossed to the other side to watch the prisoner. He tried several others but did not succeed. I then observed a gentleman go along with his handkerchief just peeping out. They immediately surrounded him, and the prisoner 
               drew
             the handkerchief out of his pocket, clapped it to his breast and ran away. I caught the prisoner as he was going down Wood-street. He threw the pocket handkerchief away directly. An officer named John Brown came up soon after. The gentleman has never appeared.

             DOWNS corroborated the account of the last witness.
JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. The prisoner and handkerchief were delivered to me.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Cheapside, and I took my handkerchief out of my bosom to wipe my nose, and the young man came up and said I stole it, which was very false; and they went after a gentleman and asked him, had he not lost his handkerchief, and he said no, don't bother me; I never stole it.

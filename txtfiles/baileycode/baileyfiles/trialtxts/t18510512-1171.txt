1171. 




MARY ANN FARMER
 was again indicted

 for receiving 2 brooches, 1 guard-chaio, 4 rings, and other articles, value 50l. 15s.; the goods of 



John William Tripe, knowing them to have been stolen.






JOHN WILLIAM TRIPE
, M.D. I missed from my house two brooches, four seals, a butter-knife, a pair of pistols, a powder-flask, and a variety of articles, worth 70l. or 80l.—these articles (produced) are all mine—about 10l. worth are not recovered yet—this opal brooch is worth 20l.





EDWIN JOHNS
. I took these articles from Dr. Tripe's at various times, and took them to the prisoner to get what she could on them—she gave me 2l. 3s. for this opal brooch, and 15s. for these two seals; my share altogether was about 3l. 5s.—I told her I took them from Dr. Tripe's





JOHN HALES
. On 10th Feb., Farmer pawned this brooch at my shop—I advanced her 1l., subsequently another 1l., and then 5s.—the intrinsic value is about 5l.—I should be glad to sell it for that—I gave it to the officer—a seal was pledged with it for 13s., which Farmer afterwards redeemed—I did not purchase the ticket of the brooch, she offered it to me of security for the last 5s. I lent her—she said she would call and take it away in a day or two—I have had it three months.





THOMAS KELLY
 (police-sergeant, H 2). I took the prisoner and told her the charge—she said she never had the things in her possession—I believe there are two or three buckles which she never did have.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. You found some property at Dr. Tripe's, which had been stolen by Johns, but had not been in Farmer's possession? A. Yes; they are not charged.

Prisoner. Half of the things I have never seen.




GUILTY
. Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(JOHNS
received an excellent character, and was strongly recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor. Aged 17.—



Confined Six Months.)

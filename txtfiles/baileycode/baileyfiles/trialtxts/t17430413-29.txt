            . I was watering this Man's Horses last Night, and saw the Prisoner brush by and take a Seat out of the Coach and run away with it; I followed him, and cried, Stop Thief; he dropped it in the Channel. I am sure he is the Man; I never had him out of my Sight; I took him by the Collar and carried him to my Master's House. - I live at the Pilgrim, in Holbourn.
- Mayhill. I am a Servant to Mr Colbrook. The last Witness brought the Prisoner and the Seat (which I can swear to) to my Master's House.
Prisoner. I was going by and this Man stopped me, and said, he had lost a Pillow out of the Coach; I never run nor nothing like it; there was a Pillow taken out of the Channel, but I never took it or passed by the Coach.

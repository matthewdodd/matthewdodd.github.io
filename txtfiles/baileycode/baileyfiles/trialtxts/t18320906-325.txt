            . I am a labourer
. I lost a cloak at Southgate fair


, on the 1st of September, about eleven o'clock at night - I had left it in my booth; I sell beer -I found the prisoner about five yards from the booth with it, under his arm; I had received information, went out, and Craskin pointed him out to me.

            . I was employed by Beard at Southgate fair, and saw the prisoner outside the booth looking through a hole in the canvas; his mate, who was with him, asked what I wanted, and while I was looking at the prisoner his mate knocked me down with a great stick - they were in company; I got up in a minute or two, and called for assistance; my master came out - I had seen the prisoner cut the booth, and take the coat out - I pointed him out to master, who came, and took him.

MRS. BEARD. This is our cloak - I saw the prisoner'shand come through the hole, and called my husband to go out.
Prisoner's Defence. I was in the booth at the time she hallooed out that she had lost her cloak - a parcel of people were round the booth at the time, making a noise about a bad half-crown; he came, and gave charge of me.

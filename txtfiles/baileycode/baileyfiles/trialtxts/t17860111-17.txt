             sworn.
I am a Grocer; on Thursday afternoon about four, I was returning home, I saw the prisoner take a large pot from Mr. Robert's door, it was a copper pot, there were two, one within another, and immediately I went into the shop, and asked the man if he had sold a pot, he said he had not, I told him a person had taken a pot and run up Well-street with it; and he turned into Castle-street, and Mr. Robert's man run quicker than I did, when I came into Berner-street, he had seized him, I know the prisoner, he is the same man, it was not five.
Prisoner. I was in liquor, and then I am out of my mind, I know not what I do.

            . On the 19th of February, a little after ten at night, I was going from Snow-hill to my own house in Cow-lane. The prisoner was walking just before me. When he came to Mr. Hales's window, he took a pump from the grate, and clapped it under his waistcoat, near the waistband of his breeches, on his left side, and was walking on: I was within a yard of him. I collared him directly, and said, You rascal, how came you by that pump? He said, he did not take it. I took him back to Mr. Hale's house. He had not gone with it above three or four steps. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going up Snow-hill; I saw this pump lying on the ground. I picked it up. I had not gone far before that gentleman laid hold of my collar, and took me back to the shoemaker's, and they took me to the Compter.

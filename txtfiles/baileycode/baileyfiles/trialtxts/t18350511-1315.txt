HENRY HADLEY
. I live at Barking, in Essex, and am a shipwright. On the 23rd of December I was at Blackwall—the prisoner, whom I had known about two years, came to see me at ten o'clock at night—I was in bed—I got up, and got him some porter and gin—we went out and got it—we came home about twelve o'clock—we had supper, and went to bed—my watch was hanging at the head of the bed—I had wound it up at nine o'clock, when I went to bed the first time—there were two children in the room with us; one about six, and the other about ten years old—I awoke in the morning about five o'clock—the prisoner was then gone, and my watch and seal—the two children were in bed and asleep—I am convinced no one had been in the room but the prisoner—I did not see him again until last Saturday, when he was apprehended—I lost a jacket and a pair of shoes also—this is my watch, chain, and seal.





EDMUND NORTH
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce this watch—it was taken in pawn of a woman on the 24th of December—she gave her name as Mary Wakeley—this is the duplicate I gave for it.





JAMES MORGAN
. I am inspector of th'e police. I went to No. 5, Russell-street, Ball's-pond—I found this duplicate there, and the prisoner's wife—the prisoner acknowledged she was his wife, and said she was worse than him, for she pawned the watch.




GUILTY
. Aged 44.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Blewitt. On the 24th of May, my master and mistress dined out; and I put the great coat in the carriage, about four, on Monday or Tuesday; I missed the great coat when the carriage came up to the door; I saw the great coat on the Saturday following, at the Justice's; I had had it about three months before I lost it; it is here.
(Produced and deposed to.)

             sworn.
I am going on sixteen. The prisoner came on the 26th of May, in the evening, to my master's shop, who is a pawn-broker, to pledge a great coat; I took it up; I said, this is a box coat; he said, no, it is not a box coat; but I have a damned good box coat at home; I am sure he is the man that pledged the coat; I saw the prisoner again on Saturday, in custody.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I found the great coat in the Mews, by the stable door; and finding no owner, I pledged it.

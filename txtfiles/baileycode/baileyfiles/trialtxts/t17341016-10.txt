            . I know the Goods that were taken upon the Prisoner belong to my Master Abraham Francia, who is a Wine Merchant
 in the City, but has a Tavern in Westminster


, from whence the good were taken.

            . I keep the Valiant-Trooper in Beer-street, Westminster; about 10 a Clock on Sunday Night, the Prisoner came into my House, and ask'd me to lend her some Money. For what? says I, for I had never seen her before. Why upon these Plates, says she. I look'd upon them, and saw they were mark'd with the Three-Tuns, by which I knew they belong'd to the Quaker's Tavern in King-street, Westminster; and thereupon I sent for a Watchman, who apprehended her - Mr. Francia is the Master of that Tavern, but he has put another Man into it.
The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

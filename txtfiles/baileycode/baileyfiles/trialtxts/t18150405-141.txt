. On the 27th of February, the prisoner between two and five o'clock, came down the area steps, along the passage, unhung a great coat of mine in the kitchen, and another that hung in the passage; at that time I was in the parlour, immediately over the kitchen; I saw the prisoner come up the area steps with the great coats under his arm. I asked him what he took them for; he said, the tailor sent him for them, they wanted altering. I secured him, and took him to the constable. These are the two coats; they are mine.

HENRY HARRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing 7 shillings, 7 sixpences, 12 pence, and 12 halfpence; the monies of 




Edward Hallam; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH HALLAM
. I am the wife of Edward Hallam, oilman, Shepperton-street, New North-road. About seven o'clock on Monday evening, the 20th

of Nov., I was in my parlour behind the shop—a man came in to buy some tobacco, and I heard him say, "What do you want here?"—I rose up, and caught the prisoner by his head, coming from under the flap of the counter—I found the till on the ground, about two yards from its place, and all the money gone—there had been about ten shillings, ten sixpences, and some coppers—I called the policeman, but no one came—there were two more persons outside the shop—they all got away.





PHILIP PARKER
. I was going into the shop for tobacco, and saw the prisoner coming from under the flap of the counter—there were two other young men outside—I heard a whistle, and they all ran away—I pursued them, but could not catch them—they kicked me about—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person—he was not taken that evening.





JOHN WESTBURY
 (police-constable N 215.) I was on duty that evening in plain clothes, and saw three men and two boys coming in a direction from the prosecutor's—I watched them through Hoxton—one of them went to a public-house, and got change, and gave some of the boys some money—the prisoner is one of the boys.

Prisoner's Defence. I was not there.





JAMES WOOD
 (police-constable N 277.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY.* * Aged 18.—

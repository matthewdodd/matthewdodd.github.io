            . I have been butler to the society of the inward Temple


 upwards of thirty years. Mr. Lloyd's Chambers are, No. three, a ground floor on the left hand in Tanfield-court


. I believe he has not been in town these seven years. He talk'd of selling his Chambers; a little before he went out of town. I was to get him a tenant, one Mr. Williams was the last person that wanted to see them. They were in the care of 
               
                  Martha 
                  Mills 
               



            , who was laundress
 for Mr. Lloyd. I went to her on the seventeenth of July, at her lodgings in White's alley, Chancery-lane; and told her a gentleman wanted to see the Chambers. She said she was ingag'd with a friend drinking a dish of tea, but would meet me at such an hour, but disappointed me. I met her in Chancery-lane the Thursday following; and told her, she did not use the gentleman well to disappoint him; she said she would meet me in half an hour at the Chambers; I went about my business, and at the time went to the Chambers; there I found her in great disorder ringing her hands, crying saying her master was rob'd; I saw the rooms were very dirty, the bedding taken away, and the feathers scatter'd about; there lay a few feathers upon the mastress; the glasses, which were large panes of Crown-glass, to the book, case shatter'd to pieces, 10 or 12 of them; all the books taken out except a few small ones, which were at the top where the glass was whole. She said the windows were unbar'd; I look'd upon them and said they could not have been opened without hands from within, having all locks to them, being then fast lock'd. They look'd as if they had not been open'd for a twelve-month, I believe they had not for some years. In the back room there were 13 or 14 drawers forc'd open. She said she always kept the key in her pocket, and that she, and her mother before her, served Mr. Lloyd twenty years.

            . I keep a pawn-broker's shop. 
               
                  Martha 
                  Waters 
               



             has used my shop eight or ten years. On January 7, 1745-6, she brought three red camlet curtains for nine shillings; on the 9th another; and on the 23d a whole set. On the 28th of March following she brought a quilt, and had six shillings; she also brought four prints of the judges the same day; and she went and fetched some more for three shillings. On the 30th she brought three more for two shillings. July 1, two more for one shilling and sixpence. July the 4th, she brought two more for one shilling and sixpence. January 30, 1746-7, she brought a candlestick for sixpence. July the 11th, 1747, a sconce looking-glass, with a gilt frame. The last time she was at my shop, was the 16th of July last; then she left a diaper table-cloth for one shilling and three pence. I have only two books of 
               
                  Anne 
                  Willson 
               



            's bringing; the first was the 28th of December for two shillings. 
               
                  Martha 
                  Mills 
               



             brought none of those things, the daughter brought all. The glass produced in court.
Mr. Woolse. I have frequently seen that glass in Mr. Lloyd's chambers, and can swear it is his property. The laundress, Mills, owned to me before the justice's, that that was taken and pawned by her daughter, Waters, by her directions, and that it was Mr. Lloyd's glass.
Stowe. Here are fifteen prints, Sir 
               
                  Peter 
                  King 
               



            , Sir 
               
                  Edward 
                  Cooke 
               



            , and others, and one red bed-curtain.
Mr. Woolse depos'd, He believed in his conscience the prints are the prosecutor's, he having a great many such, &c.
[Many books produced in court.]


                  John 
                  Worrall 
               



            . I am a bookseller, and live in Bell-yard near the Temple. I was applied to, to look after some books of Mr. Lloyd's, and to know if I had seen any books with the name Lloyd wrote. I looked over many which I had bought, and found no such name; but in one I found the reflection of a name; it was a folio book. It seemed as though the name had been wrote, and the book shut up before it was dry; (it appeared legible, by reading it as held to the light through the back of the paper; and the leaf on which it was wrote was tore out.) Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Cuthbord 
               



             came to me, and asked me if I would buy a parcel of good law books, saying, there is a woman in distress, whose husband belongs to the law, has some to sell, and that they are at Mr. Stowe's, near Lincoln's Inn, and I agreed to go and see them. I went and paid Mr. Stowe ten pounds for the redemption of them. I had some more afterwards, part of them are at home, and part disposed of.
[More books produced, brought by another person to Mr. Worrall.]
Q. to Mr. Woolse. Look at these, and see if Mr. Lloyd's name is his own hand-writing.
Mr. Woolse looks at several of them, and deposes it is his hand-writing.
Mr. Worrall. I bought more books afterwards of Mr. Stowe, which made the former up thirteen pounds; and Mrs. Wilson received the money of me; who said the books belong'd to her. That with the name reversed on the backside, she said was her book.
The receipt produced, and read to this purpose.
June 18, 1751.
Received of Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Worrall 
               



             13 l, for a parcel of books.
Signed

                  Wilson 
               



            .
Worrall. The body of it is my writing, and I saw her sign it. I paid her part, and Mr. Stowe part of the money, by her order.
Mr. Stowe. Here are four books I had of Waters, and there were some loose papers found in one of them, which Mr. Woolse deposed was Mr. Lloyd's hand-writing, and whose name was in each of them. 
               
                  Martha 
                  Waters 
               



             said she did pawn the glass by her mother's directions.
[He produced a book brought by 
               
                  Ann 
                  Wilson 
               



            , and Mr. Woolse looking upon it, deposes the name wrote is Mr. Lloyd's hand-writing. He also produced three napkins, two pillow-bears, brought by Waters, and a quilt, brought March 45-6; five table cloths, two with Ll. upon them; and a book, received of Mrs. Wilson for two shillings; and two more for nine pence. She said she brought them from a person, whose husband was dead.]
Q. Did you see the corners of many of the books tore off?
Stowe. I did.
Q. Was you never at these chambers to chuse what you liked best?
Stowe. No, I never was.
Q. Could you imagine many of these things brought could belong to these women?
Stowe. Sometimes people bring things that are not their own: it is very common so to do.

Court. You should have wrote over your door, A receiver of stolen goods.

            . I am servant to Mr. Gray-goose, over against Lion's Inn. I know only Wilson, who last December brought two parcels of books. [Produced in court, some of which were huge folio's.] I have known 
               
                  Anne 
                  Wilson 
               



             almost seven years ; her husband is a lawyer. She did not say she brought them from her husband, but from the gentleman they belong to. She has had some in and out several times.

                  Waters 
               



             pawned divers things with me, in the name of 
               
                  Martha 
                  Mills 
               



            , about fifteen months ago, as eight napkins, and three volumes of Kennet's History of England; and a bed tick pledged by Wilson for five shillings.


                  Anthony 
                  Boucher 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Singleton, the corner of Featherstone-buildings, Holbourn. 
               
                  Martha 
                  Waters 
               



             brought books to us, less than a year ago, several times; and a large folio book; with the name Lloyd wrote in it. Produced in court.
Mr. Dickerson. I am servant to Mr. Wilson, a pawn broker near Salisbury-court. On the 26th of December last, 
               
                  Anne 
                  Wilson 
               



             brought four books for one shilling and sixpence, and six more the 23d of April; all the ten was but for four shillings and sixpence. She came several times with several large books; but as she did not bring the person to me, to whom they belonged, I did not care to take them in, so I never saw her since. I observed they were law books.


                  Benjamin 
                  Brasset 
               



            . In searching 
               
                  Martha 
                  Mills 
               



            's house, I found this hanger concealed under her bed, which she acknowledged to be her property; I also found some brass knobs and screws, which I screwed to the stove in the chamber, and they fitted exactly.


                  Samuel 
                  Riley 
               



            . I am a stationer, and live in Tenfield-court, opposite Mr. Lloyd's chambers. I have observed Mrs. Mills and her daughter often to go in and out there for above a year and a half.


                  Thomas 
                  Bartholomew 
               



            . I am smith to the society at the Temple. I went to put a lock upon the door, after the chambers were robbed, and observed, that neither the windows, nor lock to the outward door, were forced, or broke, but quite secure, and the things in the chambers were stoved to pieces. Whoever did it, must get in by the help of the key.
Mr. Woolse. The book-case was full of books, at the time Mr. Lloyd went out of town. The case was locked, when the glass was broke.
Mills, in her defence, said, Wilson lay with her, and took her key unknown to her.
Waters, in her defence, said, Wilson used to desire her to assist her in carrying these things to pawn, and that she took them to belong to her.
Wilson, in her defence, said, She carried them out for Mills.
There were eight persons appeared, and gave Wilson a good character.
Mills and Waters 

               guilty
            .
Wilson 

               acquitted

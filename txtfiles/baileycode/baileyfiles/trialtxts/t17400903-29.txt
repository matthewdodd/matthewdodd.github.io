, the Prisoner came after me, and picked this Handkerchief out of my Pocket. I catch'd fast hold of him, and while I held him, he dropped it on the Ground, and I saw him drop it. So I took him before the Justice, and found he had been an old Trader this Way; for he was known, and the Justice committed him.
Prisoner. I was coming along, and the Gentleman took hold of me, and said I took his Handkerchief; but indeed I never touched it.

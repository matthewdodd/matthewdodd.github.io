VERE FANE
. On Monday, last, I was going along Fleet-street, about the middle of the day—I suddenly felt my pocket lighter than usual, and found my handkerchief was gone—I turned round, and saw the prisoner two or three paces behind me, walking away—I followed, and collared him—the handkerchief dropped from his against his feet—I picked it up—he struggled, got from me, and across the street—some persons followed, and caught him on the opposite side—we conducted him a few paces towards Temple-bar, and delivered him to an officer—I had not lost sight of him—this is my handkerchief—It has my initials on it.

Prisoner. I hope you will have a little mercy on me this I will not do so again.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

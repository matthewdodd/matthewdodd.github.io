            . I live in Ratcliffe highway


; I am a linen draper

; I am in partnership with my cousin, of the same name. I was present when the prisoners came in the shop, on the 3d of February about two o'clock.
Q. Had you any customers in the shop - A. I had two; I was waiting upon them at the same time, but I saw the prisoners.
Q. Who was in the shop of your own people - A. A young man of the name of Bishop, a brother of mine, 
               
                  George 
                  Brown
               



            , 
               
                  George 
                  Pobjoy
               



            , and myself. The prisoners came in the shop, they wished to look at some print for an apron; the shopman shewed them some; I and my young people went up to dinner. I left Pobjoy and Bishop in the shop.

            . The prisoners came into the shop, they wished to look at a piece of print for an apron; I shewed them several pieces they, fixed upon one; I cut them an apron off; they were both together; I do not exactly know which of them had the apron; they afterwards wished to look at a piece of print for a gown; they went further up the shop, where there were several goods on the counter, and I shewed them a great many pieces; I got over the counter left the prisoners; I went to get another piece, and while I was getting it out I just looked round; I saw Clark fumbling against the counter; Rawlins was standing between her and me; I put the print down, and after a little conversation I cut them off six yards, for which of them I do not; they both agreed to have it cut off; they wished to pay me a shilling in part of payment, for that and the apron, and to come in about an hour to pay the remaining part; I took the shilling of them, and put the gown and apron up, and they were going; I went up stairs to my master and told him I suspected the prisoners; he said do as you like; I came down; they went out, and I went out and looked after them; they went up a little court, about ten doors from the house, and came put almostdirectly; I and a young man of the name of Fisher followed them and told them to came back, that we did not exactly approve of their paying off a shilling on the gown and apron; they seemed rather confused; one of them said what is the matter, I cannot say which of them it was; the other said, never mind, we will go back; I went to the door nearly back again with them, and then went back and got a constable, and brought him to the house, and when I went in Mr. Brown said never mind; he gave me a piece of print into my hand, it was quite warm.
Q. to Brown. The last witness, you gave a piece of print into his hand - A. Yes; the prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clark
               



            , I saw her take the piece of print from under her apron, and put it on the counter; this is the piece of print she put on the counter, and this is the piece of print I put in my lad's hand the moment he came back; it is mine, I can swear to it.
Q. to Pobjoy. Was 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clark
               



             near that place when she was fumbling - A. I cannot say; there were a number of prints on the counter where she stood. I am sensible that Rawlins is not so guilty as the other.
Clark's Defence. I went with Rawlins to the prosecutor's shop to purchase two yards of cotton at a shilling a yard, and six yards of print at two shillings and two pence per yard, for which we left two shillings for a deposit; we were going away, and we asked the shop boy if it was all right; he said stop, I must go up stairs and make the necessary memorandum; the boy returned; we went away, and got half a mile, when the boy came up to us and desired us to come back; the prosecutor stood at the door; the prosecutor charged me with taking a green print from under my apron, he said it was there before I went away; he said upon my return I put it down upon the counter; I deny it positively, I might as I passed touch such a print, but not to my knowledge. I get my living by shoe binding.
Rawlins' Defence. I am young and pregnant; I am a married woman; I was never accused of a criminality before.
Clark called one witness, who gave her a good character.

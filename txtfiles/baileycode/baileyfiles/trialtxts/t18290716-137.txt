            . I was at Clapton on the 15th of July - I met the prisoner about ten o'clock in the morning carrying this cart cover; I asked him how he came by it; he said he found it down the road - I was not satisfied; I got assistance and secured him; he was two or three miles from the prosecutor's.

            . I live with Mr. Walter Long - his farm is at Hornsey


. I saw this cloth on his cart on the Tuesday night, close to the house, on our own premises - it was tied on; I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I went down a lane and found this cloth in the road, and thought there would be some reward for it.

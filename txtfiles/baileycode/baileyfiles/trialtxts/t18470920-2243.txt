JOHN PARKER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 pair of boots, value 5s. 6d.; the goods of Thomas Robert Dutton: and having been before convicted of felony.






FREDRICK HENSTOCK
 I am shopman to Thomas Robert Dutton, a boot-maker. On Friday evening, the 20th of Sept., I was at the end of the counter, near the window—I could not be seen from the door—I saw the prisoner take a pair of boots from the stand, put them under his coat, and walk out of the shop—I went out, found him standing two shops off, took hold of him, and taxed him with having the boots—he dropped them at my feet, and said, "He gave them me"—he did not point to anybody—I am sure he is the person—he was never out of my sight—these boots are Thomas Robert Dutton's.





JOSEPH RACKSTRAW
 (policeman.) I was duty, and saw the prisoner struggling with Henstock—I took him and the boots—these are them (produced)—going to the station, the prisoner said he did not steal them, some one gave them to him.





JOHN UNDERWOOD
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted, May, 1843,and confined three months)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY.**† Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

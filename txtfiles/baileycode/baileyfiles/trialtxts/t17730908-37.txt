            . I went with this girl to her lodgings; I do not know where it was; it was about eleven o'clock at night. I live in Honeysuckle-court, Cripplegate; when I came into her lodging the girl picked my pocket of my money; I was on the bed with her; I found her hand in my right hand pocket; when I came into the street, I told her she had picked my pocket; she said it might have fell out in the bed; then I went to a court in Petticoat-lane, and the prisoner stood at the corner; I saw the watch in Brown's hand; she gave it to one Kello, and she ran away; I took the prisoner. I had had a little liquor, but was as sober as I am now.
Prisoner's Defence.
After I came out of the house he went with the other girl up Petticoat-lane. I came out of the snuff shop, she screamed out and ran away, upon which he laid hold of me, and charged me with the watch; I never saw it; I did not attempt to run away.

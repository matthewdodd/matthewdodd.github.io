. On the 1st of October I was returning home, and stopped just by the Bull, at Aldgate


 - I jumped out of my cart for about half a minute, to get some snuff; I went into the shop, and turned to see if any body came to my cart - I saw the prisoner go to the opposite side of the cart, take this coat out, and run across the road - he dropped it at the kennel; I took it up, and pursued till he was taken - I saw his person plainly.

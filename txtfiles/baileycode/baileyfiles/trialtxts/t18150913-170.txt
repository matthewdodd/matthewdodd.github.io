; and stopped the prisoner, who was employed by me, as he was going out of the gate; I had some suspicions of him; on searching him, he had the lead in the indictment suspended by two pieces of old stockings and some cord, over his shoulders, in his small-clothes; there were twenty-eight pounds and a half.

            . I am coachman to George Cummings, Esq.; his stables are in Masons's-yard, Duke-street, St. James'


. On the 4th of March I was in the Chequers public-house, and saw the prisoner and another person come to the mews, go into the stable, and come out again; they were strangers to me, but three other persons' horses stand there; they went down Duke-street, and I saw the prisoner had something in a bag - I pursued, and took him n King-street; I asked what he had in the bag - he said, nothing of mine; I looked, and saw these articles; I brought him back; Webb, the officer, took him - his companion got away.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he say the other person gave him these things to carry? A. No; the window of the public-house was only four or five yards from the stable door, I could see it very plain - I am sure he went in; it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.

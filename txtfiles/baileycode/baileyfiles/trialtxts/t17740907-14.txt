            . On the 17th of August, as I was going up Fleet-street, by St. Dunstan's church


, I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief ( producing it) out of a porter's pocket, who had a load on his back; I crossed the way, laid hold of the prisoner, and sent after the porter; he came back and said it was his handkerchief, and appointed to meet me at the Compter but did not.
The prisoner, in his defence, said he picked the handkerchief up.
He called his father, and a publican with whom be lodged in Theobald's-row, who gave him a good character.

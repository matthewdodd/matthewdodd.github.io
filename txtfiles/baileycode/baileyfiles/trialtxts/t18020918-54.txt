             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, and lived with Mr. Brown, Panton-street, Hay-market; I know the prisoner, and saw him on the 14th of May, when he brought a pair of pearl ear-rings to pledge, which I lent him a guinea and a half on; on the 15th of May, he brought a second pair; I asked him particularly if he was not a jeweller, from having two pair so much alike, he said, no, they were his own property, (produces the ear-rings;) on Tuesday the 18th of May following, bills came from Bow-street, respecting some pearl ear-rings, which had been stolen; I applied to the Magistrate, and in about three weeks, or a month after, I saw the prisoner in the House of Correction, for Middlesex; I immediately recollected his person, and gave information at Mr. Flowers's; I had never seen him before the 14th of May.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask me, if my name was Dadley, I never saw you before? - A. I said, his name was Thomas Dadley, but did not ask him.
WATTER MULCASTER sworn. - I am a pawnbroker's servant, in Jermyn-street, at Messrs.

(The property was identified.)
Prisoner's defence. I have no friends; as to the charge made against me, I know noting of it; the man who has sworn to me, I never saw till he came to the prison; therefore I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.

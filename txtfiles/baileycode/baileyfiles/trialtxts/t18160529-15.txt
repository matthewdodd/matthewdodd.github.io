            . I am a haberdasher
. The prisoner was a servant
 of mine. On the day in the indictment, in consequence of having missed some money out of the till, I determined to have the boxes of all our young people searched; accordingly I sent for an officer, and the things in the indictment were found in the prisoner's box. The fan has my private mark on it, and am certain that the greater part of the other things are my property.

ELIZABETH LEONARD
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; and 1 pencil-case, 1s., the goods of 



William Langdon, from his person; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM LANGDON
. I am a clerk, and live at Paddington. On the 23rd of Feb., about three o'clock in the morning, I was in Oxford-street—I had been to the Southwark Literary Institution, and was walking home—I met the prisoner—she asked me to give her something to drink—I said I had no money, but she urged me—I took out my handkerchief and pencil-case to give her 1 1/2d. which was all I had—she snatched the handkerchief and pencil-case out of my hand and went off—I walked alongside of her for some time, and tried to make her give them up, and she would not—I gave her in charge.

Prisoner. A. Did you not give me the handkerchief, and 1s. 2d., and tell me to go across the park? A. No, I did not—I had not my small-clothes unbuttoned—I did not pull you about.





ELIZABETH SPREADBOROUGH
. I searched the prisoner—she took this handkerchief out of her bosom—the pencil-case has not been found.





CHARLES HAWKER
 (police-sergeant D 9.) I saw the prisoner and prose-cutor,

and as soon as the prisoner saw me she ran away down Seymour-place, got into a house, and bolted the door—I got a man to help me to break the door open, and we found the prisoner with her back against the door and her feet against the wall.

Prisoner's Defence. He was pulling me about; I heard the policeman, and Iran to my door.





ARTHUR GORE
 (police-constable D 199.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

Transported for Ten Years.

THOMAS JOHNSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of November, 1 dressing-gown, value 25s., the goods of 




Susan Batterson, and another: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS NORRIS
. I am shopman to Susan and Charlotte Batterson, of Regent-street, hosiers and glovers. On the night of the 18th of November I missed a gown from a block outside the shop door—it belonged to the persons I have mentioned—I went to New Burlington-street, and found the prisoner in custody there, and the officer had got the dressing-gown—I had seen it safe at the door about ten minutes before.





MARK TEASDALE
 (police-constable C 168.) I was in Regent-street on the night of Saturday, the 18th, I saw the prisoner take the dressing-gown from the block, and run down New Burlington-street—he threw it over the area rails—I took it, and pursued him, till I took him—I never lost sight of him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you notice whether I did not stoop?—the gown was lying down. A. No, it was not—I saw the block, and him, and all—it was fastened to the block with pins.

Prisoner. I picked it up at half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night.





CHARLES HAWKER
. I am a policeman. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I took the prisoner—he is the person who was tried then.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutrix.




Transported for Seven Years.

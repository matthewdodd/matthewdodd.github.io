Thomas Metcalfe.


MR. BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.





GEORGE STANNARD
. I am footman to Mr. Thomas Metcalfe. On the 7th of November, the prisoner was in the butler's pantry—I heard the plate jingle in the basket—there had been eleven forks in the basket—I made a communication to Waldron.





ASHLEY JOHN WALDRON
. I am butler to Mr. Thomas Metcalfe. On the 7th of November, in consequence of Stannard's communication, I charged the prisoner with stealing my master's property—after some time he pulled the leg of his trowsers up, and produced this fork from between his boot and his leg—it is a plated fork, and has my master's crest on it.





WILLIAM MASON
. I counted the forks in the basket before any were taken, and there were eleven—I counted them afterwards, and there were only ten.




GUILTY
. Aged 48.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

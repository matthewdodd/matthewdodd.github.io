Sarah Ingham. I lost 2 gowns and a cardinal as mentioned in the indictment, on the 14th of this instant May.
Q. Was the prisoner your servant?
S. Ingham. I never saw her before she was taken to my knowledge.
Q. Where were the things taken from?
S. Ingham. They were taken from a 2 pair of stairs fore-room.
Q. Where do you live?
S. Ingham. I live in Germain-street.
Q. What are you?
S. Ingham. I am servant to a butcher there.
Q. Why do you suspect the prisoner?
S. Ingham. She was taken in the street, after having been stealing in another house, and she had one of my gowns and my cardinal on her back, at the time she was taken before justice Fielding, and I went there, and told his worship I had lost 3 more gowns; he ask'd her where we lodged. She told him, he sent a constable, and I went with him to search, and there I found my other 3 gowns in a drawer, (produced in court, and deposed too) she takes up a silk and stuff gown, this she had on her back when taken and this cardinal, producing it.
Q. Can you tell how they were taken away?
S. Ingham. I cannot tell that.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

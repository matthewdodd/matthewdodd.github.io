Q. You are an hop merchant
 in the Borough


; when did the prisoner at thebar come into your service? - I believe the 15th of September, as my footman
.
Q. How long was he in your service? - A week.
Q. In consequence of some information, which I must not hear from you, I believe you searched your cellar? - I did.
Q. What did you miss? - I am not in the habit of going frequently to my collar, but my clerk did; but it was appartment that wine had been moved; I suppose I do not go into the cellar three times in a twelve-month.
Court. Then if you had not received any information on the subject, you would not have found any thing miss in your cellar? - Not excepting I had gone in.
Q. Then after going in, could you miss it? - Certainly I knew the quantity of wine that was put up, and what was consumed.
Q. In consequence of this, did you go to the public office? - I did.
Q. Was it the first time you went to the cellar, or the second that you particularly looked at the bricks? - The second time. He told me of it himself, or it was not perceivable.
Q. What was produced at the public office when you found the prisoner in custody? - A green cloth.
Q. How did you know that to be your's? - I bought it and paid for it; it is here.
Q. In consequence of something that passed as to a confession, which we shall hear presently, did you examine your cellar a second time? - I did.
Mr. Knapp. I understand that you had not been in your cellar for above three months before? - Really I cannot exactly say. I do not frequently go into the cellar.
Q. The consumption, when you did go into the cellar, seemed to have been very great? - Much diminished.
Q. Had you a servant before this man left your service? - Yes.
Q. Did you go down into your cellar the week before, when the prisoner came into your service? - I did not.
Q. You say this green cloth you bought it and paid for it? - I did.
Q. That is a practice that we should expect you are in the habit of, of course.

             sworn.
Q. On the 22d of september you apprehended the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did, in Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel, the right hand side, at No. 134; Thomas Burrows, he keeps a shop where people sell old bottles; on the prisoner I found eighteen bottles of wine.
Q. Did he say any thing to you at the time that you took him? - Yes, he did.
Mr. Knapp. You are going to tell us something that the prisoner said. You are an officer? - No, I am not; I was an officer.
Q. What did you say to him before he said any thing to you? - Did not you tell him it would be better for him to confess and tell the truth? - Nothing like it.
Q. Did not you tell him that you should certainly take him up, unless he told you the truth? - No, nothing like that.
Mr. Raine. Now go on with your story. - When I took him at the door I asked him what he had got there? I see him with something that I suspected was not right by his knocking there; the bundle was set down on the ground, and he was looking up at the window, and I said, now, what have you got here, John? I called him by the name of John. Says he, I have got some bottles of wine, and I did not come honestly by them; says I, you must go along with me to the office. In the course of a quarter of a mile, going along, he begged of me to let him go; I told him I should not. It was between five and six in the morning. (When I see him first I see him at Aldgate, before he came to Petticoat-lane.) I took him to a publichouse near the office, and he begged I would let him go, and he offered me money; I told him I would not. Then he begged me to let him go to his master; I told him I had no objection going to his master; I asked him where he lived? he said, he lived in Broad-street; I said, it is a very round about way to come from Board-street where I see you; and then he said, his master was a hop merchant, of the name of Railton, and lived in the Borough, and said, that his master was a hasty man, and he had known servants steal spoons and other things, and he had no doubt but he would look over it. I went with the prisoner to Mr. Railton's house, and Mr. Railton was not at home, and I left word for Mr. Railton to be at the office at twelve o'clock; and I spoke to Mr. Railton before he came into the office, and told him the door the prisoner knocked at, and whether he thought it proper to have a search warrant to search the house, for a man was passing by at the time that I stopped the man, and said, that he see some man at the door the morning before.
Q. What past at the office? Were you by at the examination? - I was not.
Mr. Knapp. I was wrong in stating you to be an officer of the police. How long before this had you been one? - About a week before.
Q. What office did you belong to? - Whitechapel.
Q. How came you to be dismissed from the office? - I was not dismissed; I dismissed myself.
Q. How long had you been an officer? - Two years and a half.
Q. Then you was not dismissed for any ground of complaint that was alledged against you? - If this is a fair question I will resolve you. There might be grounds of complaint. I dismissed myself.
Q. How came you to dismiss yourself? - Taking half a guinea of a black man going on board a ship.
Q. Did you ever get your dismission from the office? - I did not.
Q. Did you ever go to the office afterwards? - I have.
Q. What for? - For business; to apprehend such men as this at the bar.
Q. Any little snug informations in which you go snacks? - No.
Q. You happened to know that man before? - Yes.
Q. Did not he know that you belonged to the police office? - Not to my knowledge.
Q. On your oath, did not he know that you was an officer? Or what do you call yourself? - No. A thief-taker you may call me.
Q. He told you that he had some bottles of wine, and had not come honestly by them. Did not you tell him that if he gave up the receiver there should be an and of it? - I did not, nor a word about the receiver. I asked him what house it was he went to? he said it was a countryman of his, but what his name was he did not know.
Q. He said that he lived at Mr. Railton's, hop merchant, over the bridge? - Yes, he did; but before that he said he lived in Broad-street.
Q. Railton was his master? - Yes.
Q. Then he told you where his master lived? - Yes, he did.

             sworn.
Q. You was clerk in the office where this man was examined? - Yes He said when he came there, that he had done wrong, and was very sorry for it, and that he would wish to tell the truth. The magistrate told him if he did tell the truth it would be taken down in writing, and given in evidence against him on his trial.(The examination read.)

            , taken before him, September 22, 1795. Who faith, I have lived with Mr. Railton about a week, in the capacity of a footman; I have known Mr. Burrow about twelve months; I see him about a week ago; he knew I was a gentleman's servant, he said, if I could get any thing he would purchase it; he mentioned candles, &c. On Friday or Saturday morning last, I carried him about a dozen bottles of white and red wine; which he agreed to give me a shilling a bottle for; I took the wine out of my master, Mr. Railton's cellar, at his house in the Borough. It was about half after six in the morning when I took the wine to Burrow; he said, is this all you have brought? I told him, yes; he said, then I will pay you when you bring some more. He said, as you live in a gentleman's house, you may get me a few candles. I took some out of my master's house; he agreed to give sixpence a pound for them; he told me to get more red wine than white, that he could sell it better. The night before last I carried him about a dozen of red and white wine, which I took from my master's cellar; he said, I shall not stand to pay you now, I will pay you when you come again. This morning I was going again to his house, with eighteen bottles that I took out of my master's cellar; I was stopped by the officer in Aldgate, who spoke to me; he passed me, and I went on; he came up to me again as I was at Burrow's door, and took me into custody. Burrow told me when I came to knock at the door, I had no occasion to call. I took the linen cloths out of my master's pantry to keep the bottles from breaking, also the the green cloth; but I meant to take them back again; I never took any thing else. I did not see any marks on the corks or bottles.
Taken and signed, September 22, 1799."
Mr. Knapp to Thompson. Taplin had brought this man to the office? - Yes.
Q. And therefore all this passed after the conversation between him and Taplin? - Yes.
Q. Did the prisoner at the bar seem agitated when he made this confession? - Yes, he appeared agitated the whole time.
Prosecutor. That afternoon that I went to the office, I told him that he must have a pick lock to open the cellar door; he told me that he had not, that he had taken the bricks out by the cellar and got in there, which I found to be the case.
Q. Did you find that a sufficient quantity had been removed so as to admit a person? - So the officer said.
Mr. Knapp. This breach in the wall you had not observed before that time? - Certainly not.
Q. This was at the magistrate's that he told you this? - It was.
Q. Then it was after the conversation that had passed between Taplin and him? - It was.
Q. I would ask you whether he seemed alarmed and agitated? - Very much so. He cried and said, it was Burrow, the receiver that brought him to that. I can swear to the cloth myself.
Prisoner. The officer told me that if I spoke the truth and nothing but the truth, I should not be hurt.
The prisoner called his former master to his character.

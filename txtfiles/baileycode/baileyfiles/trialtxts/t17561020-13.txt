            . I keep a cheesemonger's shop
 in St. John Street


. The prisoner is an apprentice
 to Mr. Warder, a ferril maker, and came to my shop the 23d of last month for 2 lb of cheese for a neighbour. I said if they wanted it they would have sent somebody else. I thought he was gone away, but on seeing him go out a little time after, I look'd about, and missed twelve shillings in half-pence, which were in a little wooden tray behind the counter. I call'd after him, but was afraid to leave my shop to run after him. He was taken the next day, and I charging a constable with him he own'd he took the halfpence away, some of which were found upon him.

            . I am a constable, and had charge of the prisoner; I searched him, and found three shillings and a halfpeny in half-pence, and two sixpences. He owned this money to be part of what he took out of the prosecutrix's shop, that he had another in company with him, and they shared the money by each a handfull.
Prisoner. He said he would hit me a good knock if I would not say I took the money.




               Guilty of stealing, but not in the shop
            .

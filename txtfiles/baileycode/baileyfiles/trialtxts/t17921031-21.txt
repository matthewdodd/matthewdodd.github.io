             sworn.
On the 24th of October I saw the prisoner take a silver spoon from the kitchen window of Mr. Reeve, and put it in his pocket; it is a private house; I am an opposite neighbour; I went out and pursued the prisoner; I spoke to the prisoner, and said you villain give me the spoon; and a man that was with him laid hold of my sleeve, and said I will take him for you; I wrenched my arm from him, and he run down Bray's-buildings, and I followed him till he was taken; I am sure he is the man.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Lord KENYON.

FREDERICK LANGLEY MOORE
. I am in the employ of Thomas Moore. On the 26th of Jan., as I was coming up from our vaults, under Skinner's-hall, College-street, I passed the prisoner in Basing-lane, carrying this basket with twelve bottles of brandy—I knew the basket—I ran to the warehouse,

and missed a basket and twelve bottles, which I had placed safe in the morning—I took the prisoner—he said a person asked him to carry it to London-bridge—the basket had "T. M." on it—I can swear to it—he was coming in a direction from the warehouse.

Prisoners Defence. I was coming down the town; a man gave it me to carry.

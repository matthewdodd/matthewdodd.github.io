            . I live near Canterbury.
Q. Did you lose any clothes at any time - A. I did, the prisoner was a servant of mine; I missed these clothes on or about the 16th of November last; the coat was my own; I had never worn it above six hours. I went out to dinner, and on my return I found the prisoner had left my house without any warning, I missed several things, among which were these in the indictment.
DICKENS. I apprehended the prisoner. On the 18th of December, I told him the charge I had against him, he denied it; and afterwards he confessed it. I found this new coat, and his master's shirt, on his back, and the other things I found at his lodgings.
Prosecutor. I believe them all to be my property. I have no doubt of it.

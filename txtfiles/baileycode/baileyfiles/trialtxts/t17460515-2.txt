            . Here is the Sacking I was robb'd of the 2d of May.
Q. What Quantity?
Hide. I don't know the Quantity. Here are nine Pieces found at London-Bridge; I believe I have lost a hundred Pieces. This Gentleman, Mr. Corderoy, stopt these.
Q. What Quantity did you miss?
Hide. I did not miss it 'till the 6th of May.
Q. What Quantity did you miss then?
Hide. I believe by the Bulk of them in the Place, for there were two thousand, I believe there are near one hundred Pieces gone.
Q. Do you know what is become of them?
Hide. I don't know what is become of them at all; but as I met with these nine which I had from Mr. Corderoy.
Q. What you charge the Prisoner with are here.
Hide. Yes, there are two of them.
Court. You found the nine Pieces in Mr. Corderoy's Possession?
Hide. Yes, Sir; these are the Cloths produced in Court.
Court. Then these two Pieces are yours.
Hide. Yes, Sir.
Q. How many Yards are there in these two Pieces?
Hide. There should be twenty-four Yards in each Piece.
Q. What is the Value of them?
Hide. They are worth about fourteen Shillings a Piece, but they are valued at twelve in the Indictment.
Q. Do you know how you lost them?
Hide. I have seen them since they stood in the Warehouse, and there are little Wooden Bars, so they have put a Stick in and book'd them out as you would a Handkerchief.
Q. Where is your Warehouse?
Hide. At Brook's-Wharf.
Q. Are you sure that you lost them out of the Wharf?
Hide. Yes, I am sure of that.
Court. But you don't know who took them; you don't know it of your own Knowledge?
Hide. No, they were made for Hammocks of Men of War I made for the Government, and they have since taken a wider Sort, and they have been useless for a Year and a half.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Eliz. Cart.) What do you know of this Affair ?

Cart. Please your Lordship, this good Woman that stands here, Carlisle, she comes to our House at Five o'Clock in the Morning.
Q. What Business do you follow?
Cart. I am a Sacking-Bottom Weaver's Wife. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Carlisle 
               



             comes to my House before Five o'Clock; it was last Tuesday was se'nnight; she came to let me know there were two Pieces of Cloth that were come out of a West-Country Barge, and I thought it proper to let this Gentleman know of it. Carter the Prisoner offer'd them to Sale at our House.
Court. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Carlisle 
               



             came to your House to let you know there were two Pieces of Cloth upon Sale?
Cart. Yes.
Q. Did 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Carlisle 
               



             desire you to go with her?
Cart. Yes, my Lord.
Q. What then?
Cart. I consulted with this Gentleman first to stop these Pieces of Cloth, because I imagin'd they were not honestly come by. I went to Mr. Corderoy, the Constable, to consult with him what I should do in the Case.
Q. What then?
Cart. Then I went to Mrs. Carlisle's House, and found both the Prisoners there. Carter said it was his Cloth.
Q. When you came and found the Prisoners at the Bar, who shew'd you the Cloth?
Cart. That Man that stands there in Blue-grey, Carter.
Q. When he shew'd you the Cloth, what then?
Cart. Then I said, I wish you would carry it down to the Water-side. I told him, when he carried it home he should have the Money for it.
Cart. Then you did not ask him the Price, nor bid him any thing for it?
Cart. No. So he carried it down to the Waterside : I would have had him come over the Water, if I could; but he pretended that the String of his Breeches was broke, and desir'd this good Woman to bring him some Money directly. I wanted it to be carried to Mr. Corderoy's, under a Pretence of having Money for it.
Q. What did Carlisle say of these two Pieces? These two Pieces were at Carlisle's House?
Cart. They had a Fullpot of Beer there, and Carter said, bring me what Money you can.


                  Q. 
               


            (to

            .) Are you any Relation to the Prisoner Carlisle?
Carlisle. Yes, Sir; I am his own Wife.

                  James 
                  Carter 
               



             brought these two Pieces of Sackcloth to my House.
Q. What then? Did not Carter bid you to go and get Money for them?
Carlisle. Yes, my Lord; but I was stopt with the Goods.
Court. Then you went to Mrs. Cart's; did she or Corderoy stop you?
Carlisle. They both stopt me.
Court (to Prisoner Carter.) You hear what this Witness says; will you ask her any Question?
Carter. I don't know any thing about it, but I carried the Goods down for this Man to the Waterside.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Clement 
                  Corderoy 
               



            .) What do you know of this Matter?
Corderoy. My Lord, I deal in Sacking, and I am Constable too. My Lord, this Mrs. Cart and her Husband are Sack-Weavers; they work for me in weaving of Cloth; I have bought several Pieces of them at a Market Price, and have had some Suspicion that they were stolen.
Q. What then, Sir?
Corderoy. That was before I had a Suspicion that they were stolen. I had four before I had a Suspicion, and I had a Suspicion of the fifth Piece. This was on Saturday the 3d of May. On Monday Morning there was two more brought, and I desir'd them to bring the Persons to me. On the 6th of May they brought two Pieces with Mrs. Carlisle. I ask'd Mrs. Carlisle who she had them of; she said she they were the Property of a Person for whom she had the Disposal of them. I told her she must not take them away, but I must stop them and her too; so I takes her to Guildhall, and was before some of the Sitting Aklermen, and by her Directions went to Fleetditch, where they said Carter liv'd, but they said that 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Cart 
               



             had decoy'd them away.
Q. Did Cart bring Carlisle's Wife to you at the Time appointed?
Corderoy. Yes, my Lord. Carlisle's Wife and Mrs. Cart came together. Carlisle's Wife knew nothing of me? it was done with an Intent by Mrs. Cart, to bring Carlisle to me.
Q. Are you certain as to the Pieces?
Corderoy. I am positive to the Pieces, my Lord.
Q. Do you know any Thing of Carter's taking them, or how Carlisle came by them? How came you to bring Carlisle here: If your Witness speaks true, even Cart says Carter was at Carlisle's House, and Carter said the Goods were his; they were Carter's Goods in Carlisle's House; Now Carlisle may be a bad Man.
Corderoy. They told me Carter us'd to give him part of the Money.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Carter the Prisoner) You hear these Goods were found upon you.
Carter. I was coming down Fleet-Street about Seven o'Clock in the Morning, he (Carlisle) ask'd me to go home with him to eat a Bit of Victuals; while we were sitting together, says Mrs. Cart and Carlisle, will you carry these Things down to the Water-side?
Q. Then you did not own them to be your Goods. You hear what Cart says; that you own'd that they were your Goods.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) Have you any Witnesses to disprove this, or to come to your Character.
[The Prisoner had little to say for himself, nor any to appear for his Character.]

                   ALSBURY
               



             sworn. - I am servant to my Lord Essex; the day after Christmas-day a fire happened at my Lord Essex's house: as soon as my Lord and Lady had got out of the house, I thought it necessary to secure the plate in the dining-room; the moment I came back from my Lord Macartney's, where I had conducted my Lord and and Lady to, I found about a dozen or fourteen people in the dining-room; I ordered them all to withdraw, the prisoner was one of them; three or four of them were very unwilling to go; I desired them to go by fair means, otherwise I should use force; they all went out, and I locked the door immediately, and put the key in my pocket; I then went to my Lord's dressing-room for some writings, and, in about two minutes, I returned to the dining-room door, which I found burst open; I entered the room, and saw the prisoner putting spoons in his pocket; there were six or seven more people in the room with him; he took them from the plates that were upon the table in the dining-room; Iwent towards him, but the other people crouded me so, that he made his escape out at the door; I thought he had been gone through the porter's hall; I went to look for him, but could not see him.
Q. You did not speak to him at the time you saw him taking the spoons? - A. No; I returned and saw him in the room adjoining the dining-room, that we call the drawing-room; he was there handling something at my Lady's writing-desk; I caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had in his pocket; he said, nothing, but his own; I told him I should search him; he told me, I should not; by force I searched him, and took four spoons out of his coat pocket; I took the spoons in one hand, and him in the other, and delivered the spoons up to General St. John, who was at the door; I delivered the prisoner up to two people that I knew, who took him to the watch-house.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have learned since who this man is, have not you, that he is a hair-dresser, in Wells-street? - A. Yes.
Q.Do not you know he was acquainted with some of the servants in Lord Essex's family? - A. He was not, nor I never saw his face till that evening.
Q. Do you know Lord Shrewsbury's family? - A. Only the butler, by sight.
Q.They live in the same street? - A. No, in Stanhope-street, which is close by.
Q. Do not you know he has met with Lord Effex's servants frequently in Lord Shrewsbury's family? - A. Not that I know of.
Q.You are not a livery-servant? - A. Yes, I am, but my livery coat was so bad, that I could not put it on; I was in livery at that time.
Q. Did he not tell you that he was taking care of them for the family? - A. He did not say any any such thing.
Q.Do you happen to know whether he actually secured any articles for the family? - A. No.
Q. The man had got completely out of your sight, and might have got out of the house? - A. Yes, he might.
Q. Did you see the publican who lives over the way, that day? - A.No.
General St. JOHN sworn. - I was at my Lord Effex's on the day when this misfortune happened, I was standing before the house soon after the fire; I saw the last witness, with several other people, bringing in a man that seemed to be in custody; Alsbury desired the favour of me to take these spoons into my possession, which he said he had taken from a man who was then in custody; I cannot say whether that man was the prisoner or not; I have had these spoons ever since, (produces them); I know these table-spoons to be my Lord Essex's, there are the coronet and arms upon them; the other two spoons have my Lady Essex's initials upon them.
The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.
Alsbury. I believe he was in liquor at the time.
For the Prisoner.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with Wilson to drink tea at Stanhope-street, at Lord Shrewsbury's, to see a friend of mine, and he was to wait at a public-house till I called for him, and when I went he was gone; the fire had happened in the mean time.
Q. How far is the public-house from Lord Essex's? - A. About one hundred yards.
Q. You did not see him after the fire took place? - A. No.
The prisoner called six respectable witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.




               GUILTY
            .




               Transported for seven years
            .
The Jury wished to recommend the prisoner to mercy.
Court. It is a very bad offence taking advantage of the calamity of fire to commit depredations.
Foreman. The ground of our recommendation was the good character that he has hitherto maintained, together with the circumstance of his being in a state of inebriety.
Tried by the first Middlesex, Jury before Mr. Baron THOMPSON.

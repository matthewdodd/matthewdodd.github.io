ROBERT BOONE. I am a silk trimming manufacturer
. I live at the back of Camden's Gardens, Bethnal Green On the 1st of January I was coming from Fulham by the Fulham coach; the coach stopped at the Black Horse, at the corner of Coventry-street


; I was cold and wet-footed; I went into the house along with the coachman to have part of sixpennyworth of gin and water. I was in the house about five or six minutes, and as I was coming out of the house I heard the flap of the boot fall; the articles were in the boot. I then made the best of my way out of the house and looked in the boot, I saw the articles were gone. I left the coach and looked round and saw the prisoner in the road; I followed him until he got in the footway, and by the light of a silversmiths shop I saw the box under his arm in the bag; the bag and box were mine; I seized hold of the prisoner by the collar, and told him the property under his arm was mine; he dropped it, and told me he had not got any thing of mine. I picked up the box and took the prisoner to Bow-street. This is the box and the bag, the contents are mine.
Prisoner's Defence. As I crossed the road I picked up the box with three yards of the curb stone.

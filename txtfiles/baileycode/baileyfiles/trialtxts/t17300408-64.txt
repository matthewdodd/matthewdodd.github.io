That the Day laid in the Indictment, Thomas Williams, jun. went out with him a Thieving, and opened the Prosecutor's Casement, and he (this Evidence) took out the Goods, and carried them to the old Man, and that he gave them a Crown for them all, and took a Punch that he uses in Shoe-making, and stamp'd out the Mark of the Plates, and that the Goods were put in a Chest, upon which a Feather Bed was laid, and upon which himself, and the Prisoner, Thomas Williams, jun. lay upon after they had been out a Thieving, and that this was in the Cellar, where the old Man lay himself. And he added, that while he (this Evidence) was in the Round-House, the Son brought him Money from the Father, that he might make no Discovery . The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 

               Guilty

The Constable depos'd, That the Shoes were found in a Trunk, with the old Man's wearing Apparel. The Shoes were produc'd in Court, and sworn to be his by the Prosecutor; this Fact being also plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 

               Guilty

Nattris depos'd, That himself took off the Tin and Wood, and took out the Wig, and gave it to young Williams, and he carried it to his Father, and he gave them 4 s. for it, and wore the Wig several Sundays.
Mr. Hawkins depos'd, He found the Wig in the old Man's Box; and Mr. Flavel confirmed his Evidence, adding, that the old Man said, that it was his own wearing Wig; the Wig was produc'd in Court, and the Prosecutor swore it to be his. This, being also plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 

               Guilty
             of this Indictment likewise; the former 


               Death

SOPHIA PALMER. I live with my brother Thomas. On the 31st of January I locked three gold rings in my box, and on the 4th February I missed them - the box was still locked, but had been rummaged - I had left my keys in the house.

            . When the prisoner was in the watch-house, I went and asked him if he had taken the rings; and after some time, he gave up these two rings, and a half-crown.

            . I am a grocer, and live in Little Grosvenor-street. The prisoner brought me a ring on the 1st of February, and asked if it was gold; I said I did not know - he left it with me for two or three days, and frequently called to know if it was gold; he said he had found it in Grosvenor-square, that his master wished him to sell it, and buy a waistcoat with the money - I at last bought it of him for 5s.

FREDERICK IZANT
. I keep an eating-house in Bucklersbury—I have the use of newspapers from Joseph Thomas, from twelve till seven o'clock, and then they are returned to him. On the 11th of July the prisoner came to my house—I never saw him before—he said he came for Mr. Thomas's papers—I told him Mr. Thomas's boys usually took their hats off—he then took his hat off, took nine papers off the different tables, and went away.






JOSEPH THOMAS
. The prisoner was never in my employ—I did not send him to Izant for my newspapers—I never received them from him.

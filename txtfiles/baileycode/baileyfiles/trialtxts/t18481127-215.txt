MARIA MICKLEBURY
. I am housekeeper to Mr. John Mather, of Walworth. I hung some handkerchiefs out to dry in the garden on 28th Nov.—these are them (produced).





ELIZABETH REDDING
. I saw Burton that morning in Mr. Mather's garden—he was taking the handkerchiefs—I gave the alarm.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (policeman, P 32). I met the three prisoners in the Walworth-road, about half-a-mile from Mr. Mather's—I stopped them, and asked what they had got—they said "Nothing"—I asked them to allow me to search them—I found on Burton three of these handkerchiefs, on Evans two, and one on Allen.

Allen's Defener. A man came and asked if we would buy these handkerchiefs for 5s.; we had only 4s., and we bought them.

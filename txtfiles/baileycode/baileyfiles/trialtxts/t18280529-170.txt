            . I am the wife of John Williams; we live at Stepney


. On the 19th of April my little girl fell down in the mud; the prisoner and another woman came into my house with her, because I should not beat her; they left in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and I missed these articles; I had been dusting them about five minutes before they came - the duplicates of four images, a tea-caddy and a rummer were found on her.
Prisoner. She was very drunk, and gave me the things to pawn.
Witness. I did not - I did not tell the magistrate that Mrs. Harding had robbed me; I never allowed her to take them; they left while I was gone into the yard.

            . I apprehended the prisoner the same evening; I found these two spoons in her pocket; she dropped a china basin from under her arm - it broke; here are the pieces - I found three duplicates on her in the name of Shepherd, but the pawnbroker has left the Court: the other woman was taken, but nothing found on her - neither she nor the prosecutrix were in liquor.
Prisoner's Defence. She gave me the things to pawn.
MARTHA WILLIAMS. I did not.

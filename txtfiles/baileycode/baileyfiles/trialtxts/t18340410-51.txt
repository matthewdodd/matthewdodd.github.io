            . I am an officer. I apprehended him with the coat on his back.
JOHN WOOD re-examined. This is my coat - I believe it to be mine - I know it from the appearance - I have had it about five years - it is the same colour and cloth, and I believe the same size (trying it on) - it is my coat - I left it safe about ten minutes before two o'clock.
DAVID ROBERTS re-examined. I was about thirteen yards from him - I followed him to the top of Gracechurch-street - he took it from a cart - it laid on the back part of a chaise cart - it was at two o'clock in the afternoon.
Prisoner's Defence. It is my own coat - I bought it and paid for it.

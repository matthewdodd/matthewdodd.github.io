            . I am servant to Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Bode
               



            , who lives in Percy-street


. On the 10th of March I was cleaning the door, and went down for some water - I returned in less than a minute, saw footmarks in the passage, and missed the coat off the nail in the passage. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner come out of the next house with the coat on. I told him he had been into No. 35, and taken my master's coat - he asked me how I dared to say so? He came back with me, threw the coat off in the passage, and said he insisted on seeing my master, and he would send for a constable, and have me taken up. I sent for a constable, who took him to the watch-house.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge. He made his escape from Marlborough-street, and Furzeman afterwards retook him. I am sure he is the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

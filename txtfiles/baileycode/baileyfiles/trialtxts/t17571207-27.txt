             I am a hatter
, and live in Popin's Alley, Fleet-street


. The prisoner was recommended to me by a friend of mine to buy a hat. I left him up stairs for pretty near an hour, I know not the day, it is not a fortnight ago. After he was gone I missed a silver spoon, and could not suspect any body but him. I got a warrant of justice Fielding to search his lodgings. Then the prisoner own'd he had taken it, and open'd a drawer; he took it out, and gave it to the constable, and fell on his knees and ask'd pardon (produced in court and deposed to.)
Q. Has it any mark on it?
Bird. No, it has not.
Q. How do you know it to be yours?
Bird. Mine had no mark upon it, and the prisoner own'd it was my spoon.

            . I am a constable and search'd the prisoner's room; he acknowledg'd this spoon to be Mr. Bird's property, and own'd the taking it out of his house.
Q. Why is this tried by the Middlesex jury, seeing the robbery was in London?

Dawson. The spoon was found in Middlesex, the prisoner's lodging was in Soho.
Prisoner's Defence.
I eat some beef steaks for my dinner at the prosecutor's house, and by mistake put the spoon in my pocket, and as soon as he ask'd me about it I gave it him.

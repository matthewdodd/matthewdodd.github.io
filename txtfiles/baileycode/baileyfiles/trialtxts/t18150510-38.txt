            . I am a Thames Police officer. On Wednesday, the 26th of April, I went with Mitchell to the West India Docks


, for the purpose of searching the prisoner; we stopped the prisoner, and searched him, and found a considerable quantity of coffee about him; Mitchell took coffee from his coat pockets, his waistcoat pockets, and breeches pockets; the coffee is here. He said, he hoped we would be as easy as we could.
- MITCHELL. I went with Gotty; I can only state the same as Gotty; his account is correct.

            . I am the principal of a company at the Docks.
Q. Was it usual for a foreman to be searched - A. The labourers are searched every day; the foreman only now and then. The prisoner was foreman at No. 6, warehouse of the coffee department; the prisoner had a very good character; he has been at the Docks about seven or eight years. He was at work that day in the coffee warehouse. The coffee is worth about five shillings.
- SINCLAIR. I am the captain of that warehouse. All the property in it is under my care. We had such coffee as that found on the prisoner in the warehouse.
Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry; I picked the property up.
Sinclair. The prisoner had one pound fourteen shillings a week.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Whitechapel-road


. On the 12th of June I missed some shoes from the shop, but I did not see them taken away; I knew the parties who had been there, and suspected them - the prisoners are mother and son; I saw them both in the shop - my lad brought the boy back, who had the shoes on him - the woman returned to beg him off.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 20th of June I saw the two prisoners in the prosecutor's shop - I did not see any thing done while they were there; after they left the shop, the prosecutor said,"I have lost some shoes" - I went out after the personswho had been there, and overtook them about fifty yards from the shop; I said to the boy, who carried a basket,"What have you got there?" he let it down - he would have run away, but I would not let him; I told him he must go back with me; at that time I did not see the woman - she came afterwards to beg the boy off; they had been in the shop three or four days before - neither of them said any thing.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They both went out together? A. Yes; when I went out of the shop, and looked about, I did not see the mother; she was not in that street - the woman, when she came, looked out for a pair of shoes for her husband; I do not know how soon after the boy was taken she came to the shop, because I was gone to Lambeth-street to get an officer.

             re-examined. I should think the woman came about a minute after the lad was brought back - she came voluntarily to beg him off; when I saw them in the shop, the boy had the basket in which the shoes were found.

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street, and was sent for on the 12th of June - I found the boy in custody in the shop; his mother was also there - I asked what the basket contained; the prosecutor said shoes, and pointed to the boy; I then took him, and said to the mother, "Do you know any thing of this basket?" she said, "It's my basket, and there is a handkerchief in it" - I found one on searching it.

             re-examined. They were a quarter of an hour in the shop - the woman was looking at some shoes, and stood in one place all the time; the boy was walking round the shop; she looked two pairs of shoes out, and wished them to be put by - she said she would call again in ten minutes; she said her husband was at the gin-shop, which she named, and that she was charing there herself.

            . I am a journeyman baker
. I lent my watch to a servant girl in the house, to know the time to call me up; next morning the watch was gone; I suspected the prisoner, had him taken up; the constable found the watch upon him as I understand.
The constable deposed that he went with the prisoner to his master's, that the prisoner tumbled over some clouths, at last took the watch from under a coat. The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I don't know who gave me the watch.

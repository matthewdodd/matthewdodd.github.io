JOHN ROBINSON. I live in Carrington-street, Clerkenwell


. On the 13th of October, about one o'clock, I was in the back parlour, and saw the prisoner enter my shop - he immediately ran out, I followed, and saw this desk under his arm - he had taken it off my counter - I pursued him about thirty yards - he then dropped it on the pavement - he turned a corner - I then returned and picked the desk up, and lost sight of him - he was brought back by some person who pursued, as I called Stop thief! - I had a good view of his face, as he turned sideways when he dropped it - I am certain he is the man - I found him in custody in less than three-quarters of an hour.

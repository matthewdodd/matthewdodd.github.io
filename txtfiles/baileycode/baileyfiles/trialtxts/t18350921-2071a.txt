ELIZABETH CLEMENT
. I am the wife of George Clement. On the 18th of September, I hung a gown and a shift on a line in my passage to dry, at four o'clock in the afternoon—I afterwards received information and found my shift at a pawnbroker's—I then went to No. 21, Crown-street, where I saw my gown hanging out of the window—I told the constable; and we waited till we saw the prisoner take the gown in, and she was coming down with it ijn her hand—I had seen them safe at eleven o'clock on Thursday evening and missed them at eight o'clock on Friday morning—I found the gown, with the prisoner at eleven o'clock that morning.





GEORGE EDWARD NEEDES
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce this shift which I took in of the prisoner, I believe, before twelve o'clock, on the 18th of September.





JOSEPH BOLTON
 (police-constable F 6.) I went with the prosecutor, and saw this gown hung out of the window—the prisoner then came down with it in her hand.

Prisoner. I never entered her premises—I went to the Middlesex Hospital with my son, and bought the gown and shift of a woman for 1s—she said if whe could get the 1s., she would come and fetch them—I know the woman by sight, and had I my liberty I have no doubt I could find her.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

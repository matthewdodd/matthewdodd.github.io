THOMAS WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of July, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 




Joseph Peile, from his person.






JOSEPH PEILE
. I am a clerk, and live in Cornwall-place, Holloway. On the 20th of July, at ten minutes after nine o'clock in the evening, I was in High-street, St. Giles's—my attention was called by somebody, and I missed my handkerchief, which was safe twenty minutes before—I saw it in the policeman's hand.





WILLIAM LAST
. I live in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury. On the evening of the 20th of July I was in High-street, St. Giles's and saw the prisoner, in company with another one, older than himself, following this gentleman and two ladies, and in passing by Lawrence-lane, Bainbridge-street, I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from Peile's pocket, and I secured him directly till the constable came up—he put it inside his jacket and dropped it behind him; the policeman came up directly and picked it up.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) About ten minutes to nine o'clock I saw the prisoner and a taller one—I followed a little distance from them—I saw them close in behind the prosecutor and two ladies—Mr. Last caught hold of his arm, and I saw the handkerchief fall down from his hand behind—a hatter took it up, and gave it to me—I am certain the prisoner dropped it.

Prisoner. The hatter picked it up fourteen or fifteen yards from the policeman. Witness. It was not so—Last pinioned him, and the handkerchief fell behind him—I pointed it out to the hatter, and he picked it up—Last had hold of the prisoner—I had seen him following the prosecutor from Tottenham-court-road to St. Giles's—the handkerchief was not hanging out—I think it was about ten minutes to nine o'clock when I first saw him. 


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I live at Twickenham


, and deal in linen-drapery
. On the 15th of November, I lost five cotton shawls out of the window in my shop, about eleven in the morning; I was not at home; my mother and wife were up stairs; I never saw the prisoner till he was in custody; my mother, who was left in care of the shop, is not here: I went after the prisoner with the constable.
ALBION COOPER sworn.
I am the constable. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's mother's; she denied him; I looked about, and saw a piece of one shawl hang out from the bedclothes; I found five shawls there; I made him no promise or threat; he said, get me off to be whipped, I have something else; he instantly went to the bed, or bed-tick, and took out a glove containing fourteen and six-pence in silver; then I took him before a magistrate; the shawls have been in my possession ever since.
(Deposed to by the prosecutor, marked B=.)
Prisoner. I have nothing to say, and no witnesses.

                  West 
               



            . I am an out-pensioner of Chelsea college
. I was coming up a passage that leads into Chick-lane.
Q. What is the name of the alley?
West. Black-boy-alley


, I believe; it is somewhere thereabouts. The prisoner at the bar and three or four more women met with me, and haul'd me into a passage. They took a handkerchief from my neck, and three golden guineas and eight shillings from me.
Q. Did the prisoner take any thing from you?
West. She took my handkerchief from my neck.
Q. In what manner did they haul you?
West. They took me by the arms; one took hold of my right arm, and the other of my left, and so hauled me into the alley.
Q. Which pocket was your money in?
West. It was in my left coat pocket, in a paper.
Q. Where was you when they took hold of you?
West. I was coming up Chick-Lane; and they took hold on me, and invited me into that place, and threatened what they would do to me.
Q. How invited you?
West. They took hold of me; one of one arm, and the other by the other, and ask'd me to go in.
Q. Invited you in, where?
West. I was ask'd to go up the passage.
Q. Was you ask'd to go into a house?
West. No.
Q. Did you go willingly with them?
West. I went along with them as they pull'd me along, according to their directions,
Q. Did you go with a free good-will.
West. No, I did not.
Q. Why did you not try to get away from them?
West. I have not the proper use of my arms as another man has. I tried to get away from them as well as I could; but could not.
Q. Did you call out?
West. I was afraid to call out.
Q. Why?
West. Because I was got into such an ugly place.
Q. Where was you going?
West. Home, from Chelsea.
Q. Where do you live?
West. I live in Bridgwater-Gardens.
Q. When was this?
West. This was the 15th of January, about eight at night; and as soon as I was in this bye place, they began to rifle me.
Q. Did the prisoner take your handkerchief by force?
West. It was loosely tied.
Q. Did she use any threatening words to you?
West. I can't say there were any great railmenting, only d - ning and swearing to one another, but not to me.
Q. Did they demand any money of you?
West. They did not ask for any money; but they took it.
Q. Are you sure you had your money in your pocket at the time?

West I am sure I had; for I had my hand in my pocket, and felt it before I came up there.
Q. Do you know who took your money?
West. I believe 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             took that.
Q. Was you sober?
West. I was quite sober.
Q. Had you not drank that evening?
West. I can't say I had drank nothing. I had drank part of a pint or two of beer, with a person that belong'd to the same regiment that I did, that is in the college.
Q. Did you know you was rob'd at the time you lost your money?
West. After losing my handkerchief from my neck, I put my hand into my pocket, and found my money was gone; but I did not care to cry out in that narrow place.
Q. How long might you be in that place with them?
West. I believe I might be there with them about half an hour, from first to last. I can't limitate the time.
Q. What was you doing all that time?
West. Pulling and hauling. I can't give an account, I was so frustrated.
Q. What makes you say you believe it was 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             that took your money?
West. Because she was at my side.
Q. Did you ever meet with your money or handkerchief again?
West. My handkerchief was found at a pawnbroker's in Chick-Lane. (producing it) This is it.
Q. Did the prisoner own the taking of it, after it was found.
West. No.
Q. from prisoner. Did not you give me six-pence to go and fetch a full-pot of beer for you, when you was in that woman's (meaning the evidence) room.
West. I never deposited any money.
Prisoner. He was in that woman's house, in two rooms.
Q. Was you in a house with any women?
West. I was in no apartment at all.


                  Sarah 
                  Williams 
               



            . The prisoner brought me this handkerchief into my room, as I sat by the fireside, and asked me if I would go of an errand for her; I ask'd her what to do? She said, to pawn this handkerchief, and lay it in my own name, because I should fetch it again; so I went and pawn'd it for her.
Prisoner's defence.
This woman and her sister keep two rooms, to take unfortunate women in; this man came down stairs and gave me 6 d to fetch a full pot of beer. Since, he has taken that woman up, and carried her before justice Withers; and four days after that he took me up, and carried me before justice Fielding: and now she has laid it to me.



Acquitted of the robbery.
Guilty of stealing.

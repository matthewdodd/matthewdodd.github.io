            . I live in New Castle-street, White-chapel; I was going home from Poor-jewry-lane, on the 20th of June, at night; the prisoner overtook me in Aldgate High-street


 and said, sir, you must deliver, and collared me; I did not see that he had any weapon; I shoved him from me; he made a blow at me, and struck me over the shoulder; I called out watch! and he ran; the watchman knocked him down on the other side White-Chapel-Bar. I was but about twenty yards from him I believe.
Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that stopped you?
Davis. Yes, I am sure of it. It is very light under the lamps, and I saw him standing at the corner of Poor-Jewry-lane before that.

            . I heard the cry of stop thief about half past twelve o'clock. I saw the prisoner running out of Aldgate-high-street, so I knocked him down.
Prisoner's Defence.
The gentleman charges me with meaning to rob him, Is it probable that I should stop two gentlemen without having any weapon?
Prosecutor. There was a gentleman with me, but he ran into the highway.

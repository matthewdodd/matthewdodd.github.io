            . I live in Holborn


; on the fifth of this month, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I lost a velvet pillorean, value 5 s. which was in the window; and a woman came by and said, that a woman had taken something off the window.

Q. Did you see the woman take it?
Tuston. No.
Q. Did you see any body have it?
Tuston. Yes; Swanson had it in her hand, and she gave it to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  How 
               



            . I asked him what he did with that, and he said it was nothing to me; I took him by the collar, and said I could not be used so.
Q. Was it given by the woman to the other prisoner?
Tuston. They were close together, and one handed it to the other.

            . I was coming along , and a lad asked me if I did not see any thing taken off the window? and Mr. Tuston said he had lost a pilloreen .
Prisoner How. I know nothing of it?
Tuston. He had it in his hand, as plain as I have this in my hand.

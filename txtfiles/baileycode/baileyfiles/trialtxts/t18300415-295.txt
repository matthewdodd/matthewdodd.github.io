ROBERT HARMAN. On the 1st of March, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Coventry-street Haymarket


; I had a handkerchief in my pocket - I did not feel any thing, but a gentleman told me my pocket was picked; I turned, saw the prisoner in his hand, and my handkerchief at his feet.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Is that gentleman here? A. Yes; this is the handkerchief - I had not seen the prisoner before.

            . I was in the street, and saw the prisoner and other following the gentleman - I watched them, and saw the prisoner pick his pocket; I collared him, and the gentleman turned and took him.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear you saw him take it out of the pocket? A. Yes; the others were behind him - I do not know what became of them.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman says there were three of us, but there was only one more beside me; I saw another boy take it - I was going to tell the gentleman, when I was accused of it.

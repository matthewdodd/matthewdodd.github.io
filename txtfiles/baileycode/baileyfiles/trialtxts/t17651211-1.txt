            . I am a pawnbroker
, and live over against Spital Yard, Bishopsgate-street


. On the 18th of October, the prisoner came past my door; she looked at a cloak that hung there, and unpinn'd it. I was serving two customers: I saw her pop it under her left arm. I ran round the counter, and overtook her in Primrose-street, and took her by the shoulder; she took and threw the cloak on the ground, and begged to be let go. Mr. Fountain, an officer, was near, to whom I gave her in charge. (Produced in court and deposed to.)
Mr. Fountain. I am a constable, I was about 60 yards distance when the prosecutor laid hold of the prisoner. I saw the cloak fall to the ground. He called to me, and gave me charge of her. She said she found the cloak at his door: she said the same before the justice.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going along the street, and I picked the cloak up, but I do not know where the prosecutor lives.

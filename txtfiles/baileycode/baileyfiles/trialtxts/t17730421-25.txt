            . I saw the prisoner, just through Newgate, pick this gentleman's pocket; he crossed the way with another boy down Horseshoe Passage that goes into St. Martins-le-grand, I followed him, and took him; I found the handkerchief in his side pocket, this is it; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).

Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take it out of his pocket; it dropt out, I took it up and was going to give it to the gentleman, and this man laid hold of me.

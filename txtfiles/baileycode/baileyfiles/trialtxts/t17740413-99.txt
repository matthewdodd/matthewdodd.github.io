             is my son; on the day before St. Patrick's day I missed the linen out of my chest; I did not know the prisoner had it till I saw him with one of the shirts upon him; upon which I secured him, and then he owned he had took the shirts. (The shirt was produced by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor).
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called several witnesses to his character.




               Guilty 10 d.

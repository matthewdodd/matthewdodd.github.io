PRISCILLA MACGARY
. I am a laundress, living in Hart-place, Haggerston—I have employed Martin to carry linen for me for fifteen years. On the 9th of October I sent him with a basket of linen to Mr. Isaacs, in Houndsditch—it contained the things stated, which belong to Mr. Isaacs—the articles produced are what I sent and what I lost.





JOHN MARTIN
. I was employed by the prosecutrix to carry her linen. On the 9th of October I received a bundle containing these things—I took them in a truck with a little boy—I was at the head, and the boy pushing behind—the boy gave me information—I looked round and saw the prisoner lift the bundle out of the tail of the truck at that moment—he went a few yards and ran—I ran after him—he dropped the bundle, ran up Creechurch-lane, and turned to the left—I took the bundle up, and called "Stop thief"—I am sure he is the man—he was taken in five minutes—I lost sight of him, but I had a full view of him when he took it.

Prisoner. Q. Could you see me in the dark to swear to me? A. There was a gas-light over the door of a public-house—I saw your face.





JAMES MARSDEN
. I am ten years old—I saw the prisoner with the bundle—I did not see him lift it out—he ran, and dropped the bundle—I ran and never lost sight of him till he was taken.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking past the church—the boy ran up to me and said, "You stole a bundle out of my father's truck," and the officer took me.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

EDWARD GOODFELLOW
. I lodge at No. 4, Bird-street, in the house of William Murchie, in the front room, second floor. On Saturday, the 11th of January, the prisoner came to lodge there, and slept with me—on Tuesday morning, the 14th, I got up a little before eight o'clock, and left the prisoner in bed—I returned about five o'clock in the evening, and missed all my clothes out of the box, besides things hanging in the room—I had left the box locked—I gave information at the station-house on Tuesday, the 14th, and the prisoner was taken shortly afterwards—I was sent for to the station-house, and saw the policeman take from him two waistcoats and a shirt, and a pair of boots off his feet, which were mine—the value of all I lost is about 9l.—I am sure it is above 5l.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Justice Williams.

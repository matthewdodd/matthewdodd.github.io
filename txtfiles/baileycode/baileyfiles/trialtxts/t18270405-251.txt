MESSRS. ADOLPHUS and PRENDERGAST conducted the prosecution.
RICHARD GREGORY. I am a potatoe-salesman
, and live in Paternoster-row, Spitalfields. Crawley drove a waggon and three horses for me - he had 1l. per week, and certain perquisites, making together about 30s., and on the average more. On the 28th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, there were twenty sacks of potatoes loaded in the waggon to go to the City public-kitchen, near St. Paul's; it is a turning out of St. Audrew's-hill - I saw the potatoes shot out of the farmer's waggon first, and then weighed and loaded into ours, which had been there once before that morning - this was the second time; the potatoes were in 2cwt. sacks, and were very wet and dirty - the prisoner had a red cap on that day - another man went with him, who wore a ragged jacket and a hat, and a lad - the prisoner had such a jacket on as he has now. In consequence of information I went afterwards to the house of Richards, in the neighbourhood of the City public-kitchen, about half-past twelve o'clock - Taylor, who had received the potatoes at the kitchen, went with me, I found a basket of potatoes concealed under the front of the shop window, it was covered with one of our sacks, but not one which had been sent that morning to the kitchen - Taylor, who was with me, pointed it out to me - I looked at them, and said they were part of the last lot of potatoes sent to the City public-kitchen - I looked at them very particularly, and there appeared to me to be just 2 cwt. which was one sack - I believe, on my oath, that there were no more of such potatoes that day in London - Richards said they were not mine, for she bought them in Thames-street - I told her there were no such potatoes sold in Thames-street: she said she had them there, and that a man brought themhome - I cannot recollect whether she said she bought them that day or not - I think she said she gave 6s. a cwt. for them, the price was 7s.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did she say a man brought them from Thames-street? A. She said she purchased them in Thames-street, of a man who brought them there - they were what are called Wellington potatoes - we sell all the potatoes that grow on that farm - there may be other Wellington potatoes in London, but not of that sort and quality - they grew at a place called Mind Island, in the parish of Dagenham - I believe there were no such in London - I had seen them that morning shot out of the sacks they came from the country in; here are some of them. Richards lives at the top of the court, near the City public-kitchen; I do not know the name of it, it is the first turning on the left hand, beyond St. Paul's church-yard, on St. Andrew's-hill; she keeps a green-shop, and sells potatoes and vegetables.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you go to Spitalfields-market? A. I live there, but I am not the only potatoe merchant there. Three or four of our men wear red caps, and I dare say others may, but I never noticed any other carters wearing them in my life.
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How do you know these potatoes? A. By the particular soil they grew in, and they are a particular sort of Wellington potatoes - it has been a bad season for them, and most potatoes have grown at twice, but these were all of one growth; I said nothing to Crawley about the sacks when he left my premises.

                  TOLLEY
               



            . I am in the employ of Mr. Gregory. On the 28th of March I went out with the prisoner with the waggon; he had a red night-cap on, and a flannel jacket, such as he has on now - there were twenty sacks of potatoes in the waggon - we were to drive them to the City public-kitchen - I do not know the name of the place it is in; the waggon stopped on St. Andrew's-hill; I untied the first sack, and he took it up Ireland-yard; when he returned he took another sack another way; he was gone about two minutes with the first, and when he came back he said there was such a mob the front way, that he would carry the other the back way, and he was gone about five minutes with that; he took all the other sacks throught Ireland-yard; I could not see down the yard as I was in the waggon; I did not hear any noise of a mob; I went to the kitchen before the waggon went away; I went by Ireland-yard to it; the prisoner told me he had pitched twelve sacks there, and shot eight; we went and had some beer, and then went home with the waggon.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The first sack you opened yourself? A. Yes; and the second; I do not know that the way he took the second sack was the back way to the kitchen; he said so.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came you to untie the sacks? A. He told me to do so; there were no others untied; I had a fustian jacket, corduroy trousers, and a leather cap on; James Farrel was with us - he had a flannel jacket and a hat on.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you work in Spitafield-smarket? A. Yes - I see a great many men there in red caps and flannel jackets; the first sack I opened went the straight road to the kitchen.
COURT. Q. What do you mean by opening the sacks? A. To make them ready for shooting - but that should not be done before they got to the place - there were eight empty sacks brought back by the prisoner and the other man.


                  JAMES 
                  FARREL
               



            . I am in the service of Mr. Gregory. On the 28th of March I went with the prisoner to St. Andrew's-hill; the waggon was stopped at the but of the hill; I carried the first sack to the kitchen - the prisoner carried the second; I always met the prisoner the right way, as I was going with the sack or coming back; I had no red cap on; I cannot say whether the prisoner had.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say you carried the first sack? A. Yes - and he the other; I always met him regularly.
COURT. Q. Did you meet him at all when he came back from delivering the second sack, as you were coming back from delivering the first? A. I never missed him at all out of the way, but I cannot say I observed one sack more than another: if I had missed him out of the way when I had delivered my first sack, it would have appeared strange - there was no reason why I should not meet him that first time - I always met him - I took the first sack out of the waggon, he took the next, and we went on regularly - there were a number of persons serving out the victuals in the kitchen - I took the third sack, the prisoner the fourth, and I met him.
JURY. Q. If the prisoner had gone any other than the direct way, should you have met him? A. I do not know, but I met him with the full sack when I was returning with the empty one, when I had shot them; there is only one door to the kitchen.
COURT. Q. Did you deliver the potatoes in the kitchen? A. Yes; there are two doors to the kitchen.


                  JOHN 
                  WESTON
               



            . I am a box-maker, and live at No. 11, St. Andrew's-hill - the City public-kitchen is in New-street, Blackfriars - a waggon cannot drive close to it - they generally stop at the corner of Ireland-yard, or in Shoemaker-row - the way to the kitchen is to go up Ireland-yard. but there is another way up Green Dragon-court, up Gloucester-court, and so into Ireland-yard again- the distance up Ireland-yard may he about thirty yards - I should think the other is one hundred. On the morning of the 28th of March I saw the waggon of potatoes at the corner of Ireland-yard, but did not notice whose it was - the horses were down the hill - I met a man in Green Dragon-court with a sack on his back, which was untied at the month - he had a light coloured jacket on, and a red night-cap - he was going up Green Dragon-court, the longest way to the City kitchen - I know the shop of Richards, the prisoner - one door of it comes into Gloucester-court, and the other into Ireland-yard - he had not got to the shop when I saw him - I spoke to a person, and in consequence of what I said, Mary Hart was desired to take notice of the man - this was between eleven and twelve o'clock.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When was it that you saw the waggon? A. A quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes before I left my work in my shop - I did not observe whether it was there when I left the shop, as I had not occasion to pass it - my house is at the corner of Green Dragon-court, and I went up that court.

Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You say the short way is about thirty yards, and the longest about one hundred? A. Yes; Mrs. Hart takes in washing - she does not sell vegetables, nor do I - I said to her, "I should like to know where that man is going;" and she followed him.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you going? A. To a house at the top of Green Dragon-court, and in going I turned my face to the waggon till I got into the court, and then I should he turned from it - I had seen the waggon before, and when I came back again I staid about ten minutes.


                  MARY 
                  HART
               



            . I was in Green Dragon-court on the 28th of March - I saw Weston there. In consequence of what he said, I noticed a man who was passing with a sack of potatoes on his back; he had a jacket on, and a red nightcap - he went into (the new shop) Mrs. Richards' shop - one part of it is in Ireland-yard, and the other in Gloucester-court - it has two doors - I saw him go into that shop with the potatoes, but I did not wait.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You called it the new shop? A. Yes, because it has lately been opened - Mrs. Richards had just gone there - I did not know I was to look after the person for any thing particular - I merely saw him go into the shop.
COURT. Q. You was desired to look at the man, and you saw his cap and his jacket? A. Yes, but I took no notice of his person; I do not know whether he was young or old. I did not see his face; I merely left word where he was gone.


                  JOSEPH 
                  POTTER
               



            . I am a constable. On the 28th of March I saw the waggon near the City public-kitchen, between twelve and one o'clock; there were two men carrying out potatoes, and a boy was in the waggon; the prisoner was one of the men - he was dressed as he is now, and had a red cap on. I afterwards heard something, and went to the kitchen; I saw a great quantity of potatoes there; I did not take any of them away; I afterwards went with Taylor to Richards', to see if I could find potatoes there; this was in consequence of what I heard from Hart or Weston; I told Richards that there was an oration round the parish that a sack of potatoes had been taken into her shop; she denied it - we then began to search, and a hamper of potatoes was found under the counter - I told her I had heard that a sack of potatoes had been brought into her shop, by a man in a red cap, instead of being taken to the City public-kitchen - she said there had been no such thing brought there, but I found them covered with a sack in the hamper; they were under the counter and behind it; a person coming into the shop could not see them - the counter was enclosed on one side and open on the other; the potatoes were in the mould, and seemed damp; I could not tell whether they had been there long. Taylor, who was with me, said they were the potatoes that belonged to the City public-kitchen; Richards made no reply to that - I waited till all the potatoes were delivered, and the prisoner Crawley had put on a hat; I took him up to Weston's door, but neither he nor Hart were at home. I let him go, and took the name and number of the waggon - I afterwards saw the prisoners in custody.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You found these potatoes in the shop? A. Yes - Taylor went there with me; that was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I had seen the waggon standing - I said, "You have got a sack of potatoes, which ought to have been carried to the City public-kitchen," she said she had not; I do not know whether a red night-cap is worn by persons who carry loads; when I saw the prisoner he had a slouch hat on; I did not see any one who had a red night-cap carrying them.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you say any thing about the man who came with the potatoes? A. I said it was a man with a red night-cap; it was after I had been to her shop that I saw the potatoes were not quite delivered; I saw Crawley carry a sack or two of them up to the kitchen - he had his night-cap on then; he afterwards put on his hat, and drove the waggon.


                  JOHN 
                  TAYLOR
               



            . I am an assistant at the City public-kitchen - it is a charitable institution for the poor. On the 28th of March I saw some potatoes come there; two tons should have come - I do not know how many did come - I did not count them - it was not my place, but when they brought in some, and shot them down, I said to the prisoner and the other man, "How many have you brought in?" - they said four sacks a piece; I said I thought there were but seven altogether; the rest they pitched in the sacks as they brought them in. I went to Richards' house with Potter - I saw her, and said to her, "I understand you have had some potatoes brought in here;" she said, "No, I have not;" I said, "You certainly have" - she said, "These are all the potatoes I have got;" I said,"These are not the right sort - these are not the kitchen potatoes;" I looked about, and coming away towards the door, I stopped, and under the board I saw some potatoes like those which had been shot out - they were in a large basket, and covered over with a sack, under the showboard; I said to her, "These are the potatoes;" she said,"I bought them at the wharf;" she went into the room, and I went away; I was present in the kitchen; there was not such a crowd as to prevent any person getting to the kitchen conveniently.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go with the constable? A. Yes; I went in first - he came in immediately after me; I do not know whether he heard what I said - it is a large room; it is parted off from the shop, as a kind of sitting-room; I said, "These are the same sort of potatoes that went to the kitchen;" I did not say, "You have got some of the potatoes that came from the kitchen; or ought to have gone to the kitchen."
COURT. Q. Did you say at first, "It is reported that you have got some of the potatoes that ought to have come to the kitchen?" A. Yes.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is it not your business to attend to the quantity of potatoes? A. No, I said I thought they had only brought in seven sacks, and they said eight.

                  HERDSFIELD
               



            . I am an officer of Guildhall. I went to Richards' on Friday, the 30th of March; I saw her daughter, but did not see her till she was at Guildhall - I brought these potatoes from there, out of the hamper; she attended at Guildhall on the day following.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you beento the shop before the 30th? A. No - she came to Guildhall to explain the matter.
JOHN TAYLOR re-examined. Q. What was done with the sack which was over the potatoes? A. It was shown to Mr. Gregory.
RICHARD GREGORY re-examined. Q. Was that one of your sacks? A. Yes - it was one of a larger size, which had gone out with some washed potatoes some time before; these potatoes are the same sort as those sent to the kitchen that day; I saw these potatoes in the basket, and I desired the man at the kitchen to bring Richards to Guildhall, and I would go and fetch a man from Spitalfields - I took him to Guildhall, and it was too late - the Alderman was gone - I took him the next day, but Richards did not attend till the day after that.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Then it was on the 30th that the potatoes were taken out of her basket? A. Yes.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know of any report about the potatoes being taken from the kitchen? A. No; I could not hear that at Spitalfields.
Eleven witnesses gave Richards a good character.

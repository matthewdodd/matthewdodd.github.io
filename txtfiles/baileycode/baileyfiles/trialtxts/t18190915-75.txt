            . On the 14th of August, I met the prisoner in Oxford-street, about twelve o'clock at night, and went into the Park with her; we were there about half an hour; I fell asleep, Dwyer awoke me, she was gone, and I missed seven 1 l. country notes, which were in my pocket, in a canvass purse, when I met her. We went in pursuit, and overtook her in Oxford-street. I said,
"You have got my money." She said,
"I have not." I picked them up between her feet - I did not see her drop them - I had been drinking, but knew what I was about. The notes have my hand-writing on them.

            . I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner go into the Park; about half an hour after I saw the prisoner running from him. I said,
"I think you have robbed that man, you must stop." She ran and called out
"Watch!" I went and awoke the man; I saw his purse lying by him - we pursued and overtook her. He picked up his seven notes between her feet.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - he was drunk.

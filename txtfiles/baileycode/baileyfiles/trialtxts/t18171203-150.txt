THOMAS LEWIS. I am a waggoner
, and was in the Whitechapel-road


 with my waggon, about eleven o'clock, buying some meat - I missed my coat.

            . I saw the prisoner take the coat out of the waggon, which stopped opposite Gulston-street, Whitechapel; he ran down Gulston-street, I pursued him-he stopped to put it into a bag; I asked him what he was going to do with it? he said he was going to sell it to his old master - I asked him where he got it? he said he bought it of a farmer. I took him into custody-the prosecutor claimed it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I said I would return it.

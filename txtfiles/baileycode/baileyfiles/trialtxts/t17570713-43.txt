.
Thomas Green. The prisoner was a chairwoman
 in my house, and a shirt of mine was missing three months ago. When she was charged with taking it I heard her own she took it out of a drawer, and carried it to a pawnbroker's on Snow-Hill.
Mary Green. I am wife to the prosecutor, the prisoner used to chair at our house. I missed one of my husband's shirts, and found it at Mr. Masters's, a pawnbroker, by the direction of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hackney

                  Hackney 
               



            . I am a poor woman. I wanted a woman to look after me when I lay-in, and the prisoner agreed to come to me for a fortnight. She ask'd me if I wanted a shirt for my husband, and said she had got a charming shirt in pawn for 3 s. and 6 d. She fetch'd it out, and I seeing there was T. G. upon it I would not buy it; then she carried it to another pawnbroker's, in the name of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Ashmore 
               



            , and was angry that she was forced to pawn it again, and said she lost 2 d. by it. I ask'd her where she had it. She said she took it out of a drawer at the prosecutor's house, so I went and told Mrs. Green.
Mr. Masters. My wife told me she took this shirt in of the prisoner (producing one) and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hackney 
               



             was with her.
Q. Where is your wife?
Masters. She is ill in bed and can't attend.
Mary Green. This shirt is my husband's property.

Prisoner's Defence.
I went into a passage as I was going for a pitcher of water, and there I saw something lying in a sheet of paper; I took it up, and in it was this shirt. I kept it about three weeks, and nobody owning it I went and pawn'd it.
To her Character.

            . I have known the prisoner some time.
Q. What is her general character ?
Broughton. She used to have a good character. I never knew any harm of her. She work'd hard for her living.

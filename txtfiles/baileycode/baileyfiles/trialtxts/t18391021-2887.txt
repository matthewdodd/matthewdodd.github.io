2887. 




EDWARD CONTENSEN
 and 



AMELIA ELIZABETH CHAPMAN
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
16th of February, 28 pairs of boots, value 6l. 10s.; and 6 pairs of shoes, value 1l. 15s., the goods of 



Robert Richardson; to which


CONTENSEN pleaded 


GUILTY
. Aged 20.—



Transported for Seven Years.





ROBERT RICHARDSON
. I am a shoemaker, and live in the New-road

The male prisoner is a tailor—I took his father into my employ last Christmas, in March I took stock, and found a deficiency of nearly 100l.—we did not miss any article in particular—he was allowed by his father to sleep in my house, and he had the means of getting at the stock.





HENRY HANCOCK
. I am a pawnbroker. I have some shoes which I took in of the female prisoner on the 6th of August and on the 14th of September—I have a pair of women's boots, pawned on the 5th of July, and another pair on the 6th of May, but I cannot tell who pawned them—I have none which were pledged before the 9th of July, that I know who pawned.





JOHN BLENMAN
. I have two pairs of women's boots, pledged by the female prisoner on the 5th of July.

Chapman. I did not pawn them. Witness. I have reason to believe the did—the young man who took them in has left, and she acknowledged that she had two pairs in pledge when she came to pledge others on the 31st of August.

Chapman's Defence. I never received any boots from Contensen, who is my husband—I did not know him six weeks before I was married, which was on the 9th of July.

CHAPMAN—


NOT GUILTY
.
(There were 

two other indictments against the prisoners, to which Edward Contensen 

pleaded Guilty, and 

no evidence was offered against Chapman.)

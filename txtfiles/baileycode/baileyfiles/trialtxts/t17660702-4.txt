            . I am a carpenter
; I was at work in Castle-street, Oxford-market


; there I lost this plough, on the 1st of March, 1765, (producing one) there is my name upon it. I found it again in the possession of 
               
                  Rowland 
                  Morkin 
               



            , in May last, in New-square, by Tyburn.


                  Rowland 
                  Morkin 
               



            . I bought this plough of the prisoner at the bar, about seven months ago; he told me he was a carpenter; I gave him 6 s. 9 d. for it.
Prosecutor. The prisoner is a sawyer; he worked at the place where I did at the time I lost it; it cost me 12 s.
Prisoner's defence.
I met a woman as I was going home from my labour; she asked me if I was a carpenter; I said I was: she said her husband was a carpenter, and was dead, and she had three children, and she asked me if I would buy that plough: I bought it for 5 s. 6 d. out of pity to her children; I do not know that woman where she lives.
Prosecutor. The prisoner told me the very spot where he took the plough from, before half a dozen people, the day he was committed: he first told me, he brought it out of Somersetshire two years ago; after that, he told me he had it of a woman that had it in her apron upon some chips, who, he said, told him she found it, and that he gave her 6 d. for it.

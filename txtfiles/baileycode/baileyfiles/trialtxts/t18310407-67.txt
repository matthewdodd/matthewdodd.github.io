LOCKINGTON ST. LAURENCE BUNN. I live at the Assay-office, in Hatton-garden. On the 1st of April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was going through Smithfield-market


 to Barbican, and missed my handkerchief a little past St. John-street - I am certain it was safe half a minute before, in my outside coat pocket; I did not feel my coat move, but I usually swing my arm in walking, and on touching my pocket missed my handkerchief; there was nobody near me but the prisoner - I turned round, and seized him by the collar; I found the handkerchief concealed in the breast of his coat - he said a little boy had picked my pocket, and ran out there, pointing, but nobody could be seen; it is quite a new silk handkerchief.

            . I am a constable. I was in Smithfield, and received the prisoner in charge with the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking just behind the gentleman; two young lads were behind him - they ran back as soon as they took the handkerchief, and dropped it- I took it up, put it into my pocket, and walked by the gentleman's side, which I should not have done if I had picked his pocket.

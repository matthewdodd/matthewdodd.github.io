SUSAN JENKINS. I live at John's-hill, Ratcliff-highway. On the 13th of September, about nine o'clock at night, I was coming by the Dock wall


 with Mr. and Mrs. Williams, aman snatched off my shawl, and ran up Dock-street. I could not see who did it; the prisoner was stopped in about five minutes. I took up the shawl in the crowd.

            . I am a boot-maker. I was returning home, and saw the prisoner walking in the road in company with another man, who was behind the prosecutrix; the prisoner came on the pavement. I watched them, his companion kept behind him to hide him from my view. I saw him lift up the shawl to see if it was fastened. At the corner of Dock-street he snatched itoff, and ran up Dock-street. I pursued, calling out "Stop thief!" I never lost sight of him till he was taken - He dropped the shawl. He said it was only a joke.

            . I am a constable. I heard the alarm, and followed the prisoner up Dock-street. I took him to the office; he said he only did it out of a lark.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to meet a young woman; I mistook the prosecutrix for her, and took her shawl in a joke.

                  FORRESTER
               



            . I am an officer belonging to Portsoken ward, Aldgate. On the 6th of February, between the hours of seven and eight, I met the prisoner in Aldgate High street, with a parcel, which I had suspicion that he had not honestly come by; after he had past by me, I turned round and followed him as far as Black horse yard, in Aldgate; he turned into the yard, and there I stopped him. I asked him what parcel he had got under his arm, he made reply, what did I think; I made reply that I might think a great many things before I thought right. I asked him where he brought it from, he told me he should not tell me; by his not giving a satisfactory account, I took him into custody. Then he informed me that a man gave him the parcel, at the corner of Hounsditch. I asked him if he could find that man, he said no; he informed me that he meant to sell them at the first iron shop that he came to. I took him to the watchhouse, there I searched him. I found four parcels of rings, and fourteen guineas upon his person. The bundle he was carrying was two dozen of locks and I do not know how many thousand nails.
- MIDDLETON. Q. You were in company with Forrester. - A. Yes, we stopped him at Black horse yard, I took the parcel from under his arm; Forrester searched him, and took out these parcels from his pocket.
(The property produced and identified.)
Prisoner's Defence. I never was guilty, I got them of a man at Hounsditch; he told me to bring them as far as Petticoat lane, he said he would pay me so much to carry them.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.



               GUILTY
            , aged 39.




               Transported for Seven Years
            .
London jury, before Mr. Recorder.

            . I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square


, Mr. Sumner lives in Grafton-street


. On the 4th of November, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming from the corner of Grafton-street, he could hardly walk, I took him to the watch-house, he had 40 lbs. of lead hung on each side of his trowsers, divided in two pieces with a string round his neck. Next morning I fitted the lead to the vault of Mr. Sumner's area, the edges were quite fresh cut, there were several more rolls ready to be carried away, about 1 cwt. in all.

             sworn.
I lodge at Mrs. Fish's, I was coming through the passage and saw the prisoner in the parlour, he said he wanted a penny black pudding; I called Mrs. Fish's sister to see if she had lost any thing, she looked and missed some tea-spoons, I immediately sent her for a constable; in the mean time he took the spoons out of his pocket, and laid them down in a chair in the parlour.
(The constable produced the spoons, which were deposed to by Mrs. Fish.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went into this shop to buy a black pudding for my breakfast, I knocked several times and nobody came to me; I went to the parlour door and cried out halloo! is there nobody here? while I was standing there, this man came, and said I wanted to steal those spoons that laid in the chair, and charged me with a constable.

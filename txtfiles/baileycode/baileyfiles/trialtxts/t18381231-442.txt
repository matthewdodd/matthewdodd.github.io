EDWARD WADDILOVE
. I am in the service of William Burchett, of No. 61, Crown-street, Finsbury. About six o'clock, on the evening of the 20th of December, I was at the end of the counter, watching the prisoner, and another lad, who were lurking round the windows—I watched them ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—the prisoner crawled in on his hands and knees, and I saw him take up the two pairs of clogs, slip them under his left arm, and crawl back to the door with them—he made off with them up the street—I immediately pursued, and overtook him at the comer of the street—he perceived me, and threw them down at my feet—I picked them up in a minute, and pursued him about one hundred yards further—he ran against another lad, and I took him—these are my master's clogs(looking at them.)





WILLIAM KENCHETT
 (police-constable G 26.) I took the prisoner, and have produced the clogs.

Prisoner. I did not take the clogs.




GUILTY
.* Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live with Mr. Simpson, a haberdasher, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 4th of September, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Cheapside


; the prisoners all suddenly rushed up against me near Ironmonger-lane. I instantly missed my handkerchief, which was safe two minutes before. They all went away together, I followed them, and was about charging Johnson with the theft, seeing his hand in his bosom, when the constable come up, took my handkerchief out of his bosom, and secured three of them on the spot. Richardson was taken about thirty yards off as he walked away.

            . I am a constable. I saw all thefour prisoners together in Prince's-street, Bank, about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock, walking very slow, and observing the pockets of different passengers; I followed them, and at the top of the street they turned to the right. I ran over to the Mansion House, and got Wiltshire, we followed them, and near Messrs. Goodbehere's, the prisoners Shaw, Johnson, and Sweeney ran up to the prosecutor - Shaw picked the handkerchief out of his pocket; we immediately ran over, and laid hold of the three. Richardson went away; I am certain he was in their company - I ran and secured him. Directly we went up the prosecutor took the handkerchief from Johnson. At the Mansion House Richardson gave a false address, he afterwards said they all slept together the night before at St. Giles's.

            . Hesketh fetched me; his account is correct. I saw them all in a party together, going up the Poultry. I found a silk handkerchief in Richardson's hat.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
RICHARDSON'S Defence. My mother had been to the Bank to receive a pension, my father being an officer. I was going home when I was taken.
JOHNSON'S Defence. My father turned me out of doors. I could get no money anywhere.

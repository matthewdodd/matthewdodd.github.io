SUSAN GRADY
. I am servant to Edward Frazer, of High-street, Wapping. At half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of May, I was cleaning the hall—I left, and went into the kitchen—on coming out I saw the prisoner come from the parlour with my master's great coat—he ran away, and dropped the coat in the hall—I ran and overtook him, collared, and brought him back—I never lost sight of him.





GEORGE BANK
. I took the prisoner on suspicion of robbing the house—Gradycame to the office afterwards and brought the coat.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, and had a pint of beer with him—we crossed the road—I struck him on the back, and he chucked my hat into the passage—I went after it—the servant was coming out of the kitchen—she said I had taken some spoons—she did not mention about the coat till I got to the office.





WILLIAM STAVELY
 (police-constable G 139.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the man.




GUILTY

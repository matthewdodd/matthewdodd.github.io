            , a grocer
. I was choping some sugar in the shop, on the 6th of this instant, about nine at night, in the middle of the shop: I observed a loaf of sugar moving upon the head of a hogshead; I went towards it, and saw a man go out stooping; I went to the door, and saw him drop it within three or four yards of the door: I took it in, and nobody being in the shop, I went no farther, but stood at the door, and saw him walk down the street about ten or a dozen yards; and turn over on the other side of the way, and come back again to our window, and take up a leg of pork and a piece of butter, which were lying against the wall, by our shop-window: then I seized him; I had my eye on him all the time: the prisoner is the person. (The sugar produced and deposed to).
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been to see a friend in High-holbourn; coming back, I kicked against a lump; I took it up, and went to the gentleman's window to open it, to see what it was; and he came and took me by the collar, and said, I was the man that had taken a loaf of sugar. I am a rope-maker.

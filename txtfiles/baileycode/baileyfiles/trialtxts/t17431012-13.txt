                           John 
                           Wood

                  Thomas 
                  Averil 
               



            . There was a Coat brought to 
               
                  George 
                  Gray 
               



             to mend, the Prisoner had been at the Globe Alehouse in Crutebed-Fryars that Morning; I believe an Hour; Wood said, he believed the Man had stole his coat; I pursued the Prisoner, and took him at the Navy Office Back-Gate, with the Coat just by him, about nine o'Clock, and brought him back; he was stooping down, and seemed to shuffle something.


                  George 
                  Gray 
               



            . I had this Coat to mend; I left it in my Stall but a little while, and when I came to look for it, it was gone.


                  John 
                  Lock 
               



            . I found the Coat at the Prisoner's Feet, at the Navy-Office. 

               Guilty
            .

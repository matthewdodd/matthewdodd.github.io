            . I am the wife of John Thorp, and live in Monmouth-street


. This pelisse is mine - I had been at my box on the morning of the 8th of August, and saw it there - I went out about half-past nine o'clock, and did not return till half-past five; the box was not locked, but I had locked the door of the one pair front-room where it was - I lost several other articles - the prisoner was quite a stranger.

            . I am the officer. I took the prisoner into custody on the 10th of August on another charge - I found this piece of cotton in her apron, which led to a discovery of the other - the prosecutrix was put to bed before the prisoner was committed.

            . I a am pawnbroker. I took in this pelisse from the prisoner on the 10th of August.
Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the House of Correction six months, and then there were two officers to detain me - I bought the bit of print at the Bee-hive, up Holborn - I never was in the pawnbroker's shop.
JEREMIAH BEACROFT re-examined. Q. Have you seen the prisoner since she pawned it? A. Yes, at the office; it was pawned about half-past twelve or one o'clock - I was at dinner.

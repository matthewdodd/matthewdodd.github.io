Jos. Woodland. I am a carpenter
, and was at work at a building in Streaton Street


. The prisoner had been in the works with us, and was by my bench about two hours. I took him up on suspicion, when he confessed to me he had taken my saw and the others, and went with me to the pawnbroker's in Carnaby Street where he had pawn'd mine.
Q. What is the value of your saw ?
Woodland. It is worth 18 d.


                  William

            . The prisoner stole a tenant saw from the same place, my property.
Q. What is the value of it ?
Glide. It is worth 4 s. He took me to the place where he had pawn'd it, and there it was produced.


                  John 
                  Warne 
               



            . The prisoner stole a tenant saw of mine from the same place.
Q. What is the value of it?
Warne. It is worth 3 s.
Q. How do you know he stole it ?
Warne. Because he confessed it, and went with me to the pawnbroker's where it was found.
Q. Where are the saws ?
Warne. They are in the hands of the constable, who is not come.


                  Daniel 
                  Quince 
               



            . I took in a saw and a bag of tools of the prisoner at the bar, on the 23d of March.
Q. What did you lend him thereon ?
Quince. I lent him 3 s.
Warne. That was my saw, I have seen it since.


                  William 
                  Slayter 
               



            . I am servant to a pawnbroker, whose name is Hill; the prisoner pawned two saws with me for 2 s. 6 d.
Q. What might they be worth ?
Slayter. One might be worth about 4 s. the other 1 s. and 6 d.
Woodland. I found my saw at this man's master's house.
Glide. I found mine there also.
Prisoner's Defence.
I carried but one saw to this man's house. I leave it to the mercy of the court. It was a case of necessity, as I did it to pay some money, or I must have gone to the Gatehouse.

It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prosecutor being a Coachman
 had put his Coat into the Coach, and that the Prisoner was seen to take it out of the Coach and go away with it; and that it was found where he had pawn'd it, and the Prisoner was apprehended the next day, coming to pawn some other things. The Fact being fully prov'd, the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

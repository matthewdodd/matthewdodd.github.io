            . I am of no profession. I was going to the Haymarket-theatre


 on the 15th of October, with two friends - the constable came up to me, and asked if I had lost a handkerchief; I felt, and said I had: he said, "Is this yours?" I said, "It is certainly the colour of mine, but I cannot be certain of it."

            . I am a parish-constable. On the 15th of October I saw the prisoner, whom I knew, and another person with him - they followed the prosecutor and two gentlemen who were with him for some distance; the prisoner took this yellow handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and was putting it into his flap; he came round the coach-stand, and I took him; I went to the prosecutor, who said he had lost a handkerchief of this description.

Prisoner's Defence. It is my own - I took it out of my pocket, and used it - the officer took me; they said they would not take me to Bow-street, or they should get blown up.

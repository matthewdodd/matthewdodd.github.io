GEORGE KAIN
 and 




GEORGE SMITH
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
11th of December, 1 iron stove, value 5s.; and 1 pair of iron covings, value 4s., the goods of 



Robert Brown, and fixed to a building.






ROBERT BROWN
. I have a house which is not occupied, in the Commercial-road—I missed this stove and covings, which were fixed there—I believe them to be mine—I saw them on Thursday morning, and they were missed that evening.





GEORGE SPINK
. I am a bricklayer, and was at work at this building on Thursday evening, the 11th of December—I left at six o'clock—this stove and covings were then safe in the top-room—the next morning I went at seven o'clock—I found the back door open, and a square of glass broken—I missed the stove and covings—these are them.





CHARLES HAGAN
 (police-constable K 271.) At eight o'clock that evening, I saw the two prisoners walking along High-street, Wapping—one had the stove, and the other the covings—I asked where they got them—Smith said from his mother at Blackwall.

Kain's Defence. We met a strange man, with this stove and covings—he said he had brought them a good way, and was tired—he said if we would accept of them, we might have them—we took them home, and on the next evening, we were going to a broker's shop, and were stopped with them.

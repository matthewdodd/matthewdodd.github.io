            . As I was going to work, about a quarter before o'clock seven in the morning. I met the prisoner with some tools over his right shoulder; It was not twenty yards from the building; he looked hard at me, but did not offer to sell the tools; he said he had given 7s. 6d. for them - I said Davis had lost some tools; the prisoner said a man saw him buy them - I ran for Davis as fast as I could, and be fetched a constable, who took him.

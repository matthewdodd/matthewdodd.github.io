            . I live on Holborn-hill


, and am a tailor. On the 31st of March the prisoner came to my house with a child - she asked to look at some suits for a child between seven and eight years of age, and I showed her some, but I could not please her in the colour; there were some dresses on the counter, and she folded one of them in half - I then could not please her in price; she wanted one at about 25s.; I had not one so low - she left the shop without buying any thing, and I missed the dress which she had folded - I went after her up Holborn, but could not see her; I was returning, and went into a public-house, where I saw the same infant, whom she had had with her, in a man's arms at the bar - I asked where the famale was; he said she had gone to the back part of the house - I desired him not to let her leave - I got an officer, and saw the prisoner come in with a child, who had the suit of clothes on, which she had taken from my shop - the officer took her.

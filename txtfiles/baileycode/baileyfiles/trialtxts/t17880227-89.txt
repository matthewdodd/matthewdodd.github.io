             sworn.
The prisoner came to lodge with me about a fortnight before Christmas; she was with me about five weeks; she went away on Saturday, the 12th of January; she left the door locked; my daughter found the key in a corner by the room door; we had some suspicion she was gone, and we opened the door, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); she was searched before the Justice, and several duplicates were found upon her, by which some of the things were found again.

            , a pawnbroker, produced an apron and petticoat, which he had in pledge of the prisoner, and which were deposed to by

                   Earle
               



            .
- COLE sworn.
I searched the prisoner, and found three duplicates upon her.
(Producing them.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Soon after I came to lodge at this house, that young woman's mother went out of town; the young woman desired me to pawn these things for her, which I did; she desired me to keep the duplicates, for she might lose them; some time afterwards, I asked her if I should fetch the things out; she said, no; she had been guilty of pawning three pounds and a half worth of property of her parents to put in the lottery; since I have been taken up, her father and mother said, if I would give them two guineas they would make it up; if not, they would hang me if they could.

            . Is there any truth in this? - I deny it all, on't please you my honor.
You never desired her to pawn the things? - No.

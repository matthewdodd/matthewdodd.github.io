            . I am a silversmith
, and live in Bishopsgate-street


. About the 13th of September a silver paste buckle was forced out of my shew-glass.

                  Spencer 
               



             the evidence had a wire bent at both ends, the two prisoners at the bar were with him, they were leaning over the glass-case while Spencer with the wire pulled out a paste buckle, it fell down to the ground; I was in the shop looking at them all the while; I went and got Spencer into the shop, he got out and ran off, and was taken again in Whitechappel, then he turned evidence, and his friends took the two prisoners. (The buckle produced in Court.)

                  Thomas 
                  Simonds 
               



            , set out together, Simonds left us on Ludgate-hill, we went to Bishopsgate-street, where Moss and Alsop agreed to change coats, Alsop said, he had been at the gentleman's shop before, and he should know him when we came to it; he gave me a wire, I plucked one buckle out, the young man came out, and they ran away when I was catched.
The prisoners denied the fact.
Moss called Mr. Bridges and Mr. Norris, who gave him a good character.
Both

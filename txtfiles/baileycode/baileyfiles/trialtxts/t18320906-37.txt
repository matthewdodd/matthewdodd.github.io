 - I saw the prisoner close behind Mr. Hughes; I watched, and saw him put his hand into his pocket, and pull out the corner of his handkerchief - I informed the officer, and went on; I then saw him take the handkerchief quite out of his pocket.

             (Police-serjeant G 8). On the morning of the 21st of July I saw the prisoner near the prosecutor - I followed him about three hundred yards; he then took the handkerchief from the prosecutor, and put it into his jacket; I walked up to him as he stood at a coffee-shop door - when I got within two or three yards of him I ran up; he retreated into the shop and closed the door - I saw his hand go round behind the door; I went in, and found this handkerchief there.

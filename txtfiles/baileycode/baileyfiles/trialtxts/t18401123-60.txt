THOAMS GRIMSTON
. I am a Thames Police officer. On the 4th of November I was on duty on board the police-galley off the Strand Wharf—I saw the two prisoners come down from a wood wharf on the shore—Rice went on the Ravensbourne barge, which belongs to Mr. William Pale—he took several lumps of coal out, and placed them on the ground—Hughes tied them up in a bundle and went away—I went on shore—Hughes dropped the coals, and the prisoners ran away—I lost them for an hour and a half—I then took them in James-street, Covent-garden—Hughes said, "I will tell you the truth, Rice stole the coals, and I picked them up"—I knew both the prisoners as mud-larks about the shore—they were the prosecutor's coals, and they were on his wharf.

Bice's Defence. I did not take the coals off the barge.

Hughes. He took them off the barge, and I picked them up.

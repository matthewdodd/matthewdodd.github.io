            . I am a gardener
 at Brumpton


; on the 19th of January I lost a cock from my plough, about 100 yards from my house; as we could not plow, I sent my man to London for a load of dung; he returned, and said he believed they had got the man that stole the cock, at Knights-bridge; I went there, and saw the prisoner in custody, and my cock; he owned he had been at my house the day before.

Three men sent me with these things to a blacksmith in Tyburn-road, and they stopped me.

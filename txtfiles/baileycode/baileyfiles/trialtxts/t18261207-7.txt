            . I am in the employ of Mr. William Row, who has other partners. On Monday last I found a martin's-skin at the bottom of the warehouse-stairs - Hazle picked it up, and the men were collected to be searched.

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Row and Co. On the 4th of December, Cookson showed me wherehe had found this skin; I called the men together, there were six in all, the prisoner was one of them - he seemed reluctant to come forward, and therefore I searched him first and found eleven martins'-skins stuffed into his waistcoat and trousers - they were about half way into his trousers, but his apron quite concealed them - he said it was his first offence, and he hoped I would look over it; he has been three years in our service; we have missed property for some years past - they are worth 4s. or 5s.(Property produced and sworn to.)

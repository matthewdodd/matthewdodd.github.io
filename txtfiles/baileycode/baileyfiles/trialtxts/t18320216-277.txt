            . I live in Hackney-road


, and am a clothes salesman
. On the 6th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was opening my shop, and taking the shutters backwards; I was asked by a woman if I had lost any thing - I looked, and said I had: she said a man had come out with something, which appeared to be a silk gown and some boys' clothes, and gone down the next turning; I went, but could not see him.

            . I was coming across the road, and saw a man come out of the shop, with a bundle; he looked round, and the prisoner came out after him - they hurried down Austin-street; the prisoner is one of them - I described him to Vann, and he took him.

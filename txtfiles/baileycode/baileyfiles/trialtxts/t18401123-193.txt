CHARLES WHITEHEAD
. I am the son of John Whitehead, a shoemaker at Haggerston. On the 25th of November, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was in the back parlour, and saw the prisoner in the shop (I had not seen her come in)—she went to the shelves, and took two pairs of boots, put them under her shawl, and walked out gently—I followed her about 100 yards, and told a policeman—he took her to the station, and these boots were found on her—they are my father's—she said she brought them from Paddington.

Prisoner. I had a little to drink, and not being accustomed to it, it made me quite delirious.




GUILTY
. Aged 46.—


Transported for Seven Years.

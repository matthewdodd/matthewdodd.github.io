JOHN FRANCIS MATTHEWS
. I am a jeweller. About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of July, I was in Vinegar-yard, Drury-lane—I had a handkerchief in my pocket—a boy came running after me, and said the prisoner, who was then running before me, had taken my handkerchief—I ran after him, called "Stop thief," and he ran into the arms of a policeman—a little boy brought my handkerchief, which he said he found in a shop—I did not see the prisoner with it.





HENRY PARSONS
. I live with my father, in South Audley-street. On this evening I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and run away—I told the gentleman—the prisoner threw the handkerchief into a shop.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Drury-lane; I heard a cry of "Stop thief;"The policeman caught me; I asked what for; he said, "I don't know;" and the prosecutor came up to the boy, and said I had picked his pocket; and I said I had not.

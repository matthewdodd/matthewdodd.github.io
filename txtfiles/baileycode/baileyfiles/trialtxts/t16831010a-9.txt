                     Smith
                  



               
             and 
               
                  
                     William 
                     Smith
                  



               
             were tryed for 


               robbing the House of the Right Honourable the 
                     
Earl
 of Linsy


                   at Chelsy


, of Laced Curtains, Mantles, Silks, and divers other Goods, to the value of 50 pounds
            , which Goods, according to what in Court was sworn by the Evidence, were found in the custody of the Prisoners at a Bakers house near Newgate, to which the former Smith pleaded that he had been tryed and burnt in the hand the last Sessions for the said Robbery; but it appearing, that although he was burnt in the hand for stealing a Parliament Robe from the said Earl, yet this Robbery was committed since, so that his allegation rather augmented than extenuated the Crime, and the latter not being able to give any account of his Life and Conversation, they were both found 

               guilty
            .

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Tuesday, the 25th of October, I was on duty, and saw the two prisoners in James-street


, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house - he had nothing with him, but I took him to No. 16, Gee's-court, and in a dust hole in the back yard there I found this still.

            . I live at No. 4, Gee's-court, and sell ironmongery. On Tuesday last the prisoner brought this still to me, and asked me to purchase it; I said I did not buy any such things; he then went away: I am certain of his person.

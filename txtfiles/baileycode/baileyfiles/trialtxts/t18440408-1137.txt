HENRY STEERS
 was indicted

 for stealing 27 yards of kerseymere, value 8/. 14s., the goods of 



John Baldwin and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN BALDWIN
, woollen-draper, Cornhill. I am in partnership with Henry Baldwin, and had twenty-seven yards and a quarter of black kerseymere—I saw it safe at twelve o'clock on the 2nd of April—I missed it two hours after—this is it—it has marks on it which T can swear to.





ABRAHAM GARKSR
. I am a collector in the service of a person on Cornhill—about half-past one o'clock on the 2nd of April I was passing Cornhill, I saw the prisoner with a piece of kerseymere under his arm—I thought it suspicions and gave him in charge—he was on the run—I called to a person to stop him, and when I came to him he had dropped the cloth.





THOMAS GRACE
. I saw the prisoner drop the cloth and ran away.

Prisoner. I did not have it in my possession.





EDWARD RACE
 (City police-constable, No. 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person; I know him well.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ALBERT DENNIS SETTLE
. I am apprentice to Richard Thomas Swain, a haberdasher, in High-street, St. Giles's. On the 10th of October, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a quarter of an ounce of silk—the shopman laid a leather of silk before him and went away—I saw the prisoner take twenty skeins of silk and put into his pocket—I seized his hand, kept it in his pocket, and called the shopman—when he came up, the prisoner took the twenty skeins out of his pocket and threw them over the counter and about the place.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How far were you from him when be took these? A. Just at his elbow, not one step from him—I was serving in the body of the shop—these are the skeins of silk—a quarter of an ounce comes to 4 1/2 d.—the shopman is not here, nor is my master—I know that these are the skeins of silk which the prisoner took, by the scent of them-different dyes have a different scent.





ROBERT GARRARD
 (police-constable F 57.) I was called in and took the prisoner—I produce the silk.

Transported for Seven Years.

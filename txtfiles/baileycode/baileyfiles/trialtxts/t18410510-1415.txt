MICHAEL SMITH
. I am a linendraper, and live in Crawford-street, Marylebone. On the 24th of April, I had some shawls pinned to an iron rod at the door—I heard a noise at the door between nine and ten o'clock —I went to the door, and saw the prisoner going away—I heard a call of "Stop thief"—I ran after him, and overtook him, with one of the shawls in his possession—I called a policeman, and gave him in charge—he said he did not intend to steal it, he was only going to look at it—he was about twenty yards from the shop.

Prisoner. I never had the shawl at all. Witness. I found it in his possession.





JOHN GILBERT
 (police-constable D 73.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and secured the prisoner with the shawl under his arm—he said he was only going to look at it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

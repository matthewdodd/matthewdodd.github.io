EDWARD MOORE
. I live in Cock-alley, Shoreditch, and am a chimney-sweeper. The prisoner is my son—he lodged in the same house, up one pair of stairs—on the 15th of April, I missed my ass, which I kept in Blackhorse-fields, Kingsland-road—I found it again at Smithfield-market, on the 24th of April, near Bartholemew-close—Kenr had it—he would not deliver it up to me, and I got the officer.

Prisoner. I was at home the same day. Witness. Yes; at nine o'clock in the morning—I got a job, and went out, and was not at home till six o'clock in the evening.





HENRY KENT
. I live in Edward-stieet, Stepney, and deal in all sorts of things. I took this ass to Smithfield, on the 24th of April, and was waiting for the market to be opened—I bought it of the prisoner at Romford—my wife was with me, and she paid the money.





ELIZA ROSANNA KENT
. I was at Romford—I saw my husband buy the donkey—I knew the prisoner—I had seen him several times, and I am sure he is the person.





ROBERT TURLE
 (City police-constable No. 3.) I took the donkey and the witness Kent—the prosecutor identified the donkey.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it—I was at home that day.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

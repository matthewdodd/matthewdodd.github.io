            . (a King's Watchman) The Prisoner was employed by a Merchant to watch a Lighter of Sugar, I saw him come out of the Skuttle Hole with a Bundle; I asked him what he had got there; he said his Bed; I thought it was too little for a Bed, and it proved to be Sugar: I went down to the Lighter, and found a Hogshead broke open; I believe this to be part of it.

            . On the 5th of April the watchman stopped the prisoner and sent for me about half an hour after four in the morning; I went there, he had got nine pieces of fir, I knew it belonged to me; this was in a field next to the King's-Road, Gray's-Inn; the prisoner was taken before justice Fielding, there he acknowledged he took it away.

            . I am a watchman; about half an hour after four in the morning, on the 5th of April, I met the prisoner in Gray's-Inn-Lane with the wood on him; I asked him where he was going with it? he said, he could not tell. I stopped him, and sent to Mr. Blagrave, suspecting it to be his; his man came, and carried it back to the place where it was taken from; then we sent for Mr. Blagrave, who owned it.
Prisoner.
I hope you will forgive me; I never did so before, nor will again.

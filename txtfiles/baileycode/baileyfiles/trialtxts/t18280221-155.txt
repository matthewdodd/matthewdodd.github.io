            . I know Mr. John Harmer's house; it is in the parish of St. Luke


; I collect the rent of that and the next house for him. On the night of the 12th of January I was sent for, and found this sash in possession of the watchman - I have fitted it to the frame; it matches exactly.

            . I am a watchman. Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 12th of January, I saw the prisoner with the sash in his hand; he was two or or three turnings from the house - he turned up a court, where there was no thoroughfare; I sprang my rattle, but could get no assistance - I went up and took him with the sash; he made a twist, and got from me in Cherry-tree-alley - but he dropped his hat, which I took to the watch-house with the sash - he was taken on the Saturday night following.

            . My brother watchman gave me a description of the man; I knew the prisoner by his description, and took him on the Saturday night.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was given into my custody, and the sash also.

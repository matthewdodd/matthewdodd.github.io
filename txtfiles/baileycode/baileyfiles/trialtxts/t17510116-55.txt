            , my lord; I took him under the gateway, and asked him what he had got in his bag; he drop'd the bag and run away; I pursued and took him, and brought him back to the compting-house : he told me he got this sugar up three pair of stairs, in a place called little ease, there was a hogshead broken up. I compared the sugar that he had with that and it agreed; he was carried before an alderman and committed.

I was hired as a porter
, and this man came and took the sugar off my back; I was then in liquor, and did not then know what it was, and I drop'd it and went to go away, and they cry'd stop thief, and brought me back.

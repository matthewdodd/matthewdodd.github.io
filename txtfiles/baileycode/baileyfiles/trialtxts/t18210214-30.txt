            . I am servant to Mr. Manton, who lives at Southall




, in the parish of Hayes. On Saturday, the 27th of January, I went down to sleep there, and got there about six o'clock, and fastened the doors myself about half-past eleven o'clock. Mrs. Manton's two daughters, and one son, were at home. I got up at half-past seven o'clock next morning - it was light, and had been so about twenty minutes. I found the kitchen door open, which I had fastened the overnight, and a square of glass was broken out of the kitchen window, large enough for a man to get through. I looked about, observed a candle had been used, and saw the droppings of tallow where they had stuck it in the kitchen; I missed the linen from a basket, and the drawers were open. The linen was safe overnight. I found a hat left behind, on the dresser, some pieces of paper were in it, and concealed under the lining was a duplicate; the name of Parker was in the hat. I went to town to Lightfoot, and shewed him the duplicate.

            . I know Mr. Farrant's hand-writing. I saw this confession taken, and the prisoner sign it (read).
The voluntary confession of

                  Robinson
               



            , who says -
"I am a gardener, and have been out of a situation about three weeks, and lodge at No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street. I served the last service at Southall-green, with Mr. Parker, the pawnbroker. Between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday evening, the 27th of January, I set off from London, on foot, with a young man named James, a baker, for Southall - we had agreed to rob Mr. Manton's house there. - we got there between eleven and twelve o'clock. On Sunday morning we broke a bar in the kitchen window, and a pane of glass, got in, and opened the door of a room in a passage by the kitchen and saw a man in bed - he appeared awake, but never spoke. We found sixteen or seventeen shirts in the kitchen, two tablecloths, a pillow-case, and two glass cloths. We took a tinder-box and a candle with us, and struck a light before we got into the house. The man with me took a hut from the kitchen, and left his own. The moment we saw the man abed we made our escape, and returned to town; we went to my lodging, No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street, kept by Mrs. Thompson, where I lived with (

            , who lived with Powell, was also there. Powell and I divided the shirts, eight each, and tossed up for the odd one, which Powell won. We got to town again about seven o'clock in the morning. We gave the shirts to the two women we lived with to dispose of for us.

            . I live at No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street, Manchester-square; Robinson lodged in the same house, by the name of Jones. On Sunday morning, the 28th of January, about half-past seven o'clock, I met him with another man in the passage, each had a bundle; I do not know the other man - they went up stairs to Robinson's room. I know Williams, she also went by the name of Jones, and lived with Robinson, as his wife. The other man had a fustian jacket, and, I think, fustian breeches.

            . My husband keeps the house which Robinson lived in. I did not see him on Sunday - Williams lodged with him - the female prisoner, Jones came to see the male prisoner, Jones; she was there the two or three last days before Robinson was taken up.
ELEANOR M'GRATH. I live in Simmon's-buildings, Westminster. I know Powell by sight; he went by the name of 
               
                  Bill 
                  Powell
               



             - he came to my lodgings last Monday fortnight, and brought a bundle; he told me to keep it, and to give it to no one till he returned, for he was going to look for 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones
               



            , which is the prisoner. Plank came, and I gave him the bundle. It contained two shirts, and a damask table-cloth, marked
"Manton."
MARY M'GRATH. I am the daughter of the last witness. Powell came on a Tuesday morning to my mother's lodgings,about half-past ten o'clock, for the coat he has now got on - 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones
               



             had left it; he left his jacket on the table, and said he would call by-and-by for it, and put the coat on. Plank came and took the jacket.

             had lived in our court for twelve months. I first knew Powell about three weeks ago.
WM. ELGOOD. I am shopman to Mr. Lightfoot, of Bulstrode-street, Manchester-square. I know Powell - he brought some pistols to our shop on the 13th of January (looks at the duplicate found in the hat at the prosecutor's house), this is the duplicate for them - it was made out in my presence, in the name of Mr. Thomas. I knew him before by the name of Powell, but he did not give me that name on this occasion. The duplicate is the counterpart to one in our possession, I saw him pledge the pistols it belongs to, and is in the hand-writing of Caslake, our shopman, who is not here.


                  JOHN 
                  WALES
               



            . I am an officer. I apprehended Powell on Tuesday, the 30th of January, at the corner of Hatton-garden. I produce the hat I took from off his head; I took a shirt from off his body with the marks cut out; the maker's name is on the hat - it is Galon and Co. He said he bought the hat and shirt of a Jew. I apprehended Robinson, and took a shirt off his back with the mark cut out. I found a jacket amongst the bed-clothes at M'Grath's.
MARY M'GRATH re-examined. It is the jacket he left.


                  SAMUEL 
                  PLANK
               



            . I am an officer. I went to Lightfoot's on Sunday, the 28th of January, and next morning, the 29th, about eleven o'clock, I went towards Lightfoot's, and about thirty yards from the shop, I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones
               



            , suspecting her, I asked what she was waiting for? (she was looking towards Lightfoot's) she said she was waiting for nothing; I asked her what see had in her bundle under her arm? she said it was her own. I asked her if she was waiting for any one? she said No. I took her into Lightfoot's, and found the bundle under her cloak - which was four shirts all marked, Manton. She said
"There is another woman here, she and I were together last night in Oxford-street, and met two well dressed gentlemen, each had a bundle, we went with them to a house where we slept, and in the morning they gave us these shirts instead of money;" and they were going to India. I asked her if she had any more shirts, or had pledged any? she said No. I then saw Williams in another room there, and shewed her a shirt, which I received from the pawnbroker. I asked her if that was the shirt she brought to pledge? she said Yes, and gave the same account as the other woman, and mentioned the house they went to - she said it was in Woodstock-court. I asked her if she had pledged any of the shirts before; she said she had not, and that she had no lodging. Jones heard her mention Woodstock-court and agreed that they slept there. I left Jones in the watch-house, and took Williams to point out the house; she shewed me No. 3, Woodstock-court. and herself asked the woman if she had not slept there last night. I told the woman to answer truly as the girl was in custody for a robbery; she said,
"You did not sleep here;" she replied
"I did, I slept in No. 9," the woman said,
"That is impossible, there are two persons in bed there now, who have been there all night." I took her back to the watch-house, and took Jones there, she would not be possitive that was the house, and the woman denied her having slept there. Jones gave me her residence, No. 4, Simmon's-buildings, but said she had not slept there that night. I was present when Robinson and Powell were brought in, and the shirts taken from them. I searched Williams's lodgings on the evening of the 30th of January, and found a shirt, tablecloth, two napkins, and a towel - it was at No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street; she there went by the name of Jones. I learnt from her and Robinson that they lived together there by the name of Jones. I asked Powell when Wales took the shirt from him what he had done with the shooting jacket as he had one on yesterday; he said he never had one, and never wore any such thing. The same evening Wales and I went to M'Grath's, and found the shooting jacket. On the Thursday following, the 1st of February, I went again to M'Grath's, and she gave me a bundle.
Prisoner POWELL. Q. Will you swear I said I never wore a shooting jacket, or did I say I never had one of my own - A. He said he never wore one.

            . I am a writer and grainer. On Monday night, the 12th of November, I saw the prisoner in company with another young man, and after some time he walked by this shop, turned back, took the mattress off the rack, put it on his shoulder, and crossed the road; the Policeman stopped him - his companion made off: I should know him again.

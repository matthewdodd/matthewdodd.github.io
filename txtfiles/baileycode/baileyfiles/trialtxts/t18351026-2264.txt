THOMAS CURTIS
. I am bar-man to Thomas Thornton, who keeps the Adam and Eve, Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 23rd of October, I was behind the counter—there was a guard at the door window—in consequence of information, I jumped over the counter, went out, and saw the prisoner running across the road—I ran after him, caught him, and from under his coat I took this guard, which had been at our window.





WILLIAM SAVAGE
 (police-constable H 55.) I saw the prisoner crossing the road, and this guard was in his left hand.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.





THOMAS CURTIS
. It had been screwed up, but the screws were stolen, and it was hung up by these hooks—it could not fall.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—

CHARLES BURGESS
. I am a super numerary City policeman. On the 22nd of Jan. I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill—I saw him, with another, go up to the prosecutor's pocket, take a handkerchief out of his right-hand pocket, and pass it into his own breeches-pocket—I took him by the collar, and, before he could get it into his pocket, took it from him—it, was in his pocket and in his hand also.





WILLIAM LEIGH WOOD
. I live in the Minories. On the 22nd of Jan. I was on Tower-hill—I distinctly noticed a push behind me—Burgess

brought up the prisoner to me, and produced my handkerchief—this is it, and the one I lost.

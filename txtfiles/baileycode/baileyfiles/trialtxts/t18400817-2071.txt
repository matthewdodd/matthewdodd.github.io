LOUISA DALE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of July, 16 pieces of woollen cloth, value 18s., the goods of 



Thomas William Parkinson; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS WILLIAM PARKINSON
. I am a tailor, and live in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane—the prisoner never worked for me. On Friday the 22th of July she came to my shop and asked for work, she mentioned a name I knew, and said she lived there—she had asked for work several times—I gave her two pairs of trowsers to make—there were perhaps sixteen pieces of cloth—she promised to come next morning for different things to finish them, but she did not—I went to where she stated, but she did not live there, and had not for twelve months—I gave her into custody ten or eleven days after.

Prisoner. Q. I worked for you a length of time, and I did not give a false direction. A. You never worked for me, that I am aware of—I offered to pay for the things if you would tell me where they were.





THOMAS DAVIS
. I live in Bowl-yard. I am the person the prisoner represented herself to have lived with—I have not seen her these last eight months.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to ask for work—his wife gave me two pairs of military trowsers without any fittings, and told me to call for them in the morning; she then asked where I lived, as I had worked with her mother many months—I met some friends, and getting the worse for liquor, I lost the trowsers, and not finding them, I wrote to the prosecutor's mother-in-law, saying I would pay 2s. a-week till I had paid; in a few hours the prosecutor came to where I was working, and gave me in charge.





JOHN SUMMER
 (police-constable. S 257.) I produce a certificate from Mr. Clark's office, of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

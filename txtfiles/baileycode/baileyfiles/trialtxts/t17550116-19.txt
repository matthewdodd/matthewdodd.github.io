            . On Wednesday last, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on Ludgate-hill


, going to St. Paul's church-yard; just as I was between the end of the Old-Baily and Ludgate, I used my handkerchief, and put it into my pocket. Immediately after that, I felt my coat turn on one side; I clapt my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; upon which I turned back, and found this boy behind me. He went on the other side the street; I had my eye upon him, and saw him come back to the same place where I lost my handkerchief. I went up to him as he was standing in the gateway, and took hold of his collar, and said, I believe you have got my handkerchief. He said he had not; his hand was then behind him, under his coat; I took hold of that arm, and brought it from under his coat; in it was this handkerchief, ( producing one ) it was my handkerchief, the same I used just before. He said he had found it.
Q. Was it in a dirty coodition, as if picked up from the ground?
H. Aurbury. No, sir; he said, before the alderman, another boy picked my pocket, and flung it behind him, and he picked it up.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going to take a walk with a boy to London-bridge; I did not know that he was a pick-pocket. He took the gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket, and threw it behind him, and I picked it up; the gentleman came and collar'd me.

            . I keep the Horse and Groom alehouse in Holborn. The prisoner came to live with me the 29th day of March; she remained with me four days. I missed money several times out of the bar in that time; I was only at the finding the halfpence upon her. The next witness can give a farther account.

            . I live in the same yard. I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's bar, and put her hand into a bag and take out a quantity of halfpence and put them into her pocket. I told of this. She was searched, and to the amount of about four shillings in halfpence were found upon her; she had a six-pence in silver in her pocket. The account she gave of her having that money was, that she had bought a ribbon near Temple-bar over night, and changed a five-and-three-pence, and that was the change out of it. We went with her to the shop; the people declared they never sold her any ribbon.
Q. to prosecutor. Had you any silver in the bag?
Prosecutor. Not as I know of.
Prisoner's Defence.
I changed a five and three-pence at that shop, and that was the change. I never touched a halfpenny of his money. The woman at the shop said she could not remember it. The shop was full of people.

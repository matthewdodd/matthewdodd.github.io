 the 21st of March between eight and nine in the evening, I missed my handkerchief out of my pocket; I turned round and saw it in the prisoner's hand; he dropped it immediately; I seized him, and as I was carrying him to gaol he drew a knife on me and endeavoured to cut me with it in order to make his escape.

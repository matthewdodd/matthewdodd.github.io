            . I am a ship pump maker
, and live in Lower Shadwell


. My son lives in the house, I do not live in it; it is my house. The prisoner was my servant
, and lived in the house.

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, about half-past five in the morning, the prisoner passed me with something under his great coat, I asked him what it was, and he ran away. I followed him; he fell down and the pump fell from him. I secured him. I never lost sight of him.
RICHARD PLUMPKIN. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house. I asked him where he got the property; he said, he found it. When I left the watch-house, I found a key in the lock-up-room, and asked the prisoner, why he concealed it there; he said, "what, my master's street-door key!" nobody else had been in the room but the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
GEORGE DODSON. I lost the key six months ago, it exactly fits my lock-the prisoner had lived with me ever since last May.

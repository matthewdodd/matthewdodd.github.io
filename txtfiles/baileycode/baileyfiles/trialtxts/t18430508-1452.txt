JOSEPH SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of April, at 


St. Marylebone, 11 spoons, value 11l.; and 8 forks, 4l.; the goods of 



Hugh Parkin, in his dwelling-house.






HARRIET CRAMP
. I am lady's-maid in the service of Mr. Hugh Parkin, of No. 33, Montague-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On the afternoon of Friday fortnight I saw the prisoner go up the area steps—he was brought back to the house shortly after, and drew from his breast eleven table-spoons and eight forks—he gave them to me, and said, "If you will forgive me, this is all I have taken"—they are my master's.





MARY BARTON
. I live in Paradise-buildings. On Friday afternoon fortnight I was at Mr. Parkins's house as charwoman—I heard a noise while at tea, went out, and saw two boys on the top of the area steps—some one cried out, "Stop him"—I saw the prisoner run from the area—he was pursued and stopped—I told him to give up what he had got—he said, "Shall I be forgiven?"—I said I had not the least doubt he would if he would give me what he had—he returned to Mr. Parkins's with me, and I saw him deliver up to Cramp eleven table-spoons and eight dessert forks—I afterwards saw the plate counted, and eleven spoons and eight forks were deficient—the plate was given to the policeman, with the prisoner.





WILLIAM ROBERT BLACK
. I am a police-inspector of the D division. I received the property from the constable who took the prisoner—it has been in my possession ever since, and I produce it.





JAMES DEWHURST
. I am butler to Mr. Parkin. These spoons and forks are his property—they are worth 15l. or 16l.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along; I heard a cry of "Stop thief;" a gentleman came and caught hold of me; the woman took me back to the house; they took me into the kitchen; they took up a quantity of plate, and charged me with stealing it.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 18.—


Transported for Twelve Years.


Before Mr. Justice Coliman.

             sworn.
I live in King-street


; I had just weighed three pounds of tea and put in a paper bag; the prisoner and another woman came into the shop; the prisoner went to the back part of the shop, and then came to the fore part, and said to the other, I will go forwards and tell them to get it ready; she asked for nothing herself; the other bought a quarter of an ounce of tea and went away; I missed the tea, and pursued the prisoner; I found the tea upon her; I brought her back, and she was committed; I made the bag myself just before, and dried it at the fire.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A woman gave me the tea to hold; I never was in the shop.

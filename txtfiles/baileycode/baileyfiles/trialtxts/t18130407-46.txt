            . I keep the Bull's Head, public-house, Smithfield Bars


. On Saturday morning, I saw Griffen and Smith walk up and down Smithfield Bars just by our house, and on my seeing them there some mornings before that I looked out of the window. I suspected them. I saw this prisoner open Messrs. Eykin's door.
Q. What is Mr Eykin - A. An oilman




, at Smithfield Bars. The prisoner went in, and when he came out he brought a barrel out on his shoulder; then about half an hour after one the prisoner and Smith came together again. They then both went away together.
Q. Do you know where they went to - A. No, I do not. About half after one, they came again. Then Smith went into Mr. Eykin's; he brought out a barrel the same as the other. Two officers, Carlisle and Tillcock came up at the time. I spoke to them. They secured the property about three parts across the sheep-pens in Smithfield, where the prisoner pitched it. When Carlisle and Tillcock came up to him the prisoner attempted to run away. They took Smith; Griffen ran away.
Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that went in once - A. Yes, I am quite sure.

            , SENIOR. I am an officer. On the 13th of March, I came into Smithfield, about half past one; Wootton told me there had been two men robbing Mr. Eykin. He said, there was one of them over the way with the tub on his shoulder. I went after them. There was only one man, Smith. I did not see the prisoner.
ROBERT GILLAM WILSON. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Eykin and Company.
Q. What are their names - 
               A. John Eykin

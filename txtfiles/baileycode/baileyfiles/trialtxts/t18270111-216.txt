            . I am in partnership with 
               
                  Michael 
                  Emanuel
               



            . The prisoner had been in our employ, but had left us before May last - we never authorised him to receive any money from Mr.

                  Hunt
               



             - he never gave me any account of money received since he left.

WM. OGLE HUNT
            . A person called on me for 6l. 16s., for Messrs. Emanuel, in May last; but if it was the prisoner, he is so much altered, I do not know him - I knew him when I paid him the money, as having been in their employ - I paid him, and he wrote this receipt.

            . This receipt is in the prisoner's hand-writing. My partner was not in town in May - he left town in March, and could not have sent him.

 (police-constable H 96.) I found the prisoner close by where his mother lives, sitting on the steps of a door, at ten o'clock at night—I told him he must go with me to the station-house, for robbing his mother—he said in going, "She cannot hurt me now; there was none of the property found on me"—he asked me at the station-house to ask his mother to forgive him—she said she could not—he said he would serve her a b-y sight better when he came out. again—he said he had pawned some of the articles in the Borough, and sold the boots—we went there, but the things had been taken out the day following.

Prisoner. I am always used ill by my mother and brother—I had a place at a paper-stainer's—they never would give me a bit of "victuals to eat.

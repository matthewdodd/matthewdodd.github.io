            . I am a tailor
. On the 29th of May I was near St. Giles' church


, about half-past ten o'clock at night; I was going home to Berwick-street - the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to treat her; I refused- she walked by my side to the corner of Bainbridge-street, when another girl came up; they whispered together - the other girl then made a snatch at my watch, got the chain and seals, and ran away; I attempted to follow her, but the prisoner caught hold of my hand, and struck me several times; I have quite lost my property - I gave the prisoner into custody.

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor was running through Bainbridge-street, crying Stop thief! I took the prisoner, and he gave charge of her for stopping him from taking a girl who had stolen his watch-chain.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing by; the prosecutor was calling Watch! he took hold of me, and said I must have known the girl who had robbed him - I know nothing of the girl; I never saw her.

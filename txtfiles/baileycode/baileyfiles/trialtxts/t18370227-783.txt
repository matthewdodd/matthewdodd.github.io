JOHN GIBBS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
14th of November, at 
St. George, 1 watch, value 5l., the goods of 



John Reed, in his dwelling-house.






ELIZABETH REED
. I am the wife of John Reed, he it a sailor, and is the owner of the house. I have known the prisoner seven years—his grandmother lodges with me, and he came to visit her—he was there on the 14th of November, and had been for several weeks—I locked my watch in a box that day in the back room, and went out about eleven o'clock—I returned about seven o'clock in the evening, and the box was broken open, and the watch gone—it has not been found—the prisoner slept in the house that night—he confessed that he took it and sold it—it was worth 5l.—it was a silver watch—I had had it about two years—it was given to my husband, and he gave it to me before he went to sea.






WILLIAM NEWMAN
. I am the prosecutrix's brother. She informed me she had been robbed, and next morning I spoke to the prisoner about the watch he had taken from ray sister—he said he had taken it—he and his grandmother cried, and she said she would try to get it, and I said he should not leave the house alone—I sent a friend with his grandmother to a person in Whitechapel, to whom he said he had sold it, but it could not be found.





REUBEN EDWARDS
. I went with the grandmother to the house, and there saw a man, but the watch has not been found.





JAMES LEE
. I apprehended the prisoner on the 5th of February, and asked him who Cohen was—he said he was a man who bought stolen things—I went after him, but could not find him—he has since left his house, and has not been heard of since—the watch has not been found.

Prisoner's Defence. I do not know any thing at all about it—he said if I got the watch, he would not hurt me—I said I knew nothing about it, I was not in the house at the time it was reported to have been stolen.




GUILTY of stealing under the value of 5l.—Aged 18. 


Transported for Seven Years.

I am a carman; I had a load of clover-seed; I believe it was the 16th, I can't rightly tell the month; it is turned of two months since; I was carrying it from Galley Quay to Mr. Collett's in the Borough; it was Mr. Collett's property; I was up in the cart loading of it; I loaded 15 bags, and one was cut on the Quay; I had got about five bags into the cart when I found one was cut; I heard the seed running; I did not see who cut it.

Court. The other witness said the 16th.
Simmonds. It was the 4th of March; I observed the prisoner near to the cart, he had got his apron full of seed, the seed was running; when he saw me he run up Galley Quay gateway; I pursued him, and took him at the top of the gateway; he threw the seed away, it was afterwards picke up, it is in Court; he said nothing but only
"let me go;" the seed belongs to Mr. Collett.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 28th of August, I saw the prisoner and two others run across Oxford-street; I pursued and took them in the opposite street. I had seen the others pass something to him, and saw him throw the money behind him. I caught him, and picked them up.

            . I took him to the watch-house, he wanted to shew me where he took the brooms from, and took me to North Audley-street, but it was not there; but he fell down on his back and would not go with me; at last he said, a tall boy took them, and gave them to him; and that he was standing by.

. These brooms hung over an iron rod at my door; I missed them, and the officers brought them; they hung very high, somebody taller than the prisoner must have taken them, or he must have had a stick; I do not remember seeing them after the morning.
Prisoner. Q. Were they hung up separate or together - A. Together.
Prisoner. I know they were separate.

                  Peek
               



            , who is a coach-maker
, and lives in Worship-street


. On the morning of the 31st of August I missed the glasses - They were safe in the carriages in the shop the night before. The back fence was broken down.
THOMAS FITZGERALD. I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 31st of August, about five o'clock, I was opposite my door, in Long-alley, Moorfields, and saw the prisoner with a bag on his shoulder; I watched him - He crossed, and put the bag down at an area-gate just by; a boy was with him - He came out of the alley. I asked him if he had left them? he said, Yes. The boy went up the alley; I came up to him, and asked him who he wanted? he said he wanted a person of the name of Jenkins. I told him there was no such person there; he got away-the prisoner was close to me, I laid hold of him, and told him he must go with me. He begged me not to take him, and resisted. I gave him to another man while I fetched the bag, which contained seven carriage-glasses. I found an open knife in his pocket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A person asked me to carry the sack, and said he would give me 2s. for my trouble. He told me to put it down, which I did, and received 1s. of him.

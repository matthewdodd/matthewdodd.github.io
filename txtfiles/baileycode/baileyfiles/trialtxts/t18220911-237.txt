. This umbrella hung inside the shop. About two o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came in to pledge a gown; she was there about a quarter of an hour. I was informed she had taken an umbrella. Upon looking, I missed it.

Prisoner. Q. Did not I have one in my hand when I came into the shop - A. I did not see. I followed and took it from her hands, about thirty yards from the shop, and brought her back; she endeavoured to conceal it.

Prisoner's Defence. I took a silk umbrella into the shop, and must have taken this by mistake. I left my own umbrella there.

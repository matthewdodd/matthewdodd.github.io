            . I live on Windmil-Hill


; I had been out all day at my labour, February the eighth, and coming home about eleven, saw the window open ; there was a pain of glass taken out, and another broke.
Q. What did you miss?
Airs. I lost a copper saucepan, that holds two gallons, a teakettle , three candlesticks, a stand, and a pair of snuffers . I know nothing farther than their own confession, upon which I found my goods again. The saucepan they had pawn'd on Saffron-Hill , at the Seven Stars. My wife was out with me about business.
Both 


               guilty of stealing, but not out of the dwelling house
            .

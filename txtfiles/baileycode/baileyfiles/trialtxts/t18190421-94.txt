            , ESQ.
 I live at Forrest-hill. On the 27th of March, about two o'clock in the day, I was in Chancery-lane


. I turned round, and found the two prisoners close to me; suspecting them, I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I took hold of Thompson, and between the two I saw the handkerchief drop - they were close together - Thompson got away. I called to him to stop, but he still ran. I secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I live in the City-road. I was in Chancery-lane, and saw the two prisoners close to Mr. Clark, which excited my suspicious. Mr. Clark seized Thompson, and the handkerchief dropped from one of them. Abbott ran off into Bream's-buildings; I pursued, and brought him back. Thompson also escaped into Carey-street, but was brought back.

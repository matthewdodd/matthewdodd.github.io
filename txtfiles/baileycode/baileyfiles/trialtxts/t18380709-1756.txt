WILLIAM TRODD
. I am a tinman, and live at Woolwich. The prisoner took my lodging with her husband a month ago last Saturday—they passed as man and wife—they hired a ready furnished room at 4s. 6d. a week, and occupied it—the man started away on Saturday morning, but the woman remained till Sunday evening at half-past ten o'clock—I never received a farthing from them—the prisoner went without notice—I went into the room and missed a counterpane, a blanket, and a sheet—the prisoner was taken last Sunday about twelve o'clock—this blanket and sheet are mine.





WILLIAM GREEN
. I am a watchman. I received information that the female had run away from her lodgings—I heard she was at a house—I went and found her there—she delivered me up three duplicates.





JAMES FREDERICK MILLS
. I am shop-boy to Mr. Davis, a pawnbroker. This blanket was pawned by a little girl, who is here.





ELIZABETH MORRIS
. I live at home with my parents. The prisoner

told me to pawn this blanket—I took the money and duplicate to the prisoner—I believe it was a shilling I got on it.

Prisoner. I was in distress at the time—I expected to get the money, but could not—I never resisted.

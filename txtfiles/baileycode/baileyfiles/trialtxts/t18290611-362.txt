            . I live at No. 80, Wood-street, Cheapside


. I missed some property, and suspected the prisoner, as she had left my service without notice - she had been with me one month; I went with the officer and found a silk dress, a green silk bonnet, and this other property on the prisoner, which is mine.
HENRY TURNPENNY. I am a City officer. On the 8th of June the prosecutor applied to me, and I went with him to Flying Horse-yard - the prisoner was not there then; we went the next day, and while we were there she came in - this property was produced by the woman who kept the room she slept in; I asked her if there were any silks there, and she gave me these rolled up in this white petticoat, and said the prisoner brought them there; the prisoner said she bought them of her mistress for 13s. or 14s. - this gown and bonnet I took off the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)

THOMAS HARRIS. On the 17th of October I was in Wych-street


; I felt something twitch my great coat. I turned round; I observed the prisoner; he had a handkerchief in his hand at that time; he clapped his hand behind him, and dropped the handkerchief behind him on the ground. This is the handkerchief: it is mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing along. The handkerchief was not in my hand.
- . I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. I was looking out of my first floor window.

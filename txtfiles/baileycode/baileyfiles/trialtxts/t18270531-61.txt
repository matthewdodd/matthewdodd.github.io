JOHN WEBSTER. I am servant
 to the master of the Charter-house. On the 17th of May, at ten o'clock at night, I was in Aldersgate-street


 - the prisoner rushed by me; I suspected he had robbed me, from his manner; I felt in my coat pocket, and missed my snuff-box. I followed, and collared him - he denied the charge, but threw my box into the middle of the road; I held him, and picked it up; he cried bitterly, and said it was his first offence; I saw nobody with him.

            . I am an officer, and received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
GUILTY. Aged 12.

             - we lodge in Charles-street, Covent-garden


. I hired the prisoner on the evening of the 24th of April, and on the 26th we left her in care of our apartments and the children, early in the morning, and about one o'clock I went home, and found her gone - she had given no notice. I had given her 13 s. to pay for something which was coming home. I left a purse containing thirty-five shillings, in half-crowns, sixpences, and shillings, under the bed - this was gone with the rest of the articles stated in the indictment.

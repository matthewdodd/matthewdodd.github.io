            . I live near Ball's Pond, just beyond Islington


. I lost my shirts on the 10th of August, between eight and nine in the morning, a child told me he saw the prisoner get over my garden fence; I followed the prisoner, and took him.

            . As I was going home to my breakfast, I saw the prisoner in the lane, and as I came from my breakfast, I saw him get over the pales, I saw something white under his arm; I ran and told Mrs. Mott.

Q. 
            Are you sure it is the same man - A. Yes; I am sure the prisoner is the same man that got over the pales, and that had something white: I run after him: three men stopped him; Mr. Eakin brought him back.

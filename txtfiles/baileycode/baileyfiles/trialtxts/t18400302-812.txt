JOSEPH JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, of the 
24th of February, 1 coat, value 2l. 10s., the goods of 



John Stafford.






GEORGE LYALL
. I am in the employ of John Stafford, a tailor in Holborn. On the 26th of February I missed a coat, about seven o'clock in the evening—it was brought back about five minutes after by Bassett—this is it—(looking at it)—it is my master's—it was hanging just inside the door.

Prisoner. You stated that a woman was standing at the corner of Field-lane with it, and you took it from her, that she said she did not see me drop it, and now you say that Bassett brought it to the house. Witness. No, he brought it to me—I pursued you up Fetter-lane—the woman had the coat.





JAMES BASSETT
. I am in the employ of Mr. Scott, of Water-lane. I was coming up Holborn and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner with the coat trying to put it on—he saw me and dropped it—I picked it up, and gave it to a lady, and pursued him—I got the coat again, and gave it to Lyall.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and turned up Fetter-lane—after a time I found I was the pursuer, and being pursued—I was not trying to put it on.




GUILTY
.† Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

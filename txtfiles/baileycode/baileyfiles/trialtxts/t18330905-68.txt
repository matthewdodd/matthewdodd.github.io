            . I am studying as a conveyancer
, and live in Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 27th of July, I packed up the articles stated in the indictment in a carpet bag, and gave them to 
               
                  George 
                  Courcell
               



            , to take to the Greyhound in Smithfield; there was a plate on the bag with my name on it - the articles never reached the place I sent them to - I have seen the property at the office.

Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What time of day was it - A. I think a little before twelve o'clock; I think it wanted ten minutes to twelve.


                  GEORGE 
                  COURCELL
               



            . I am turned twelve years of age, I know the nature of an oath, - in July last, I was errand boy at the prosecutor's chambers. On the 27th of July, he gave me a carpet bag, to take to the Greyhound - as I was going through Lincoln's-inn-fields - I saw the prisoner Smith, - he asked me if I knew any body who wanted an errand boy - I told him "No," he then asked me where I lived, I said, "At No. 58, Lincoln's-inn-fields;" he asked me what my mistress' name was; I told him"Cooper," she is the housekeeper of the house; he walked on with me till we came opposite Fulwood's-rents, in Holborn; he then asked me where I was going, and I told him to the Greyhound in Smithfield - I told him that my mistress wanted a servant of all work - he then bade me good day, and crossed over - I went on till I got to King's Head-court


, and then the prisoner 
               
                  James 
                  Stracey
               



             came up to me, and gave me a note which was wafered, directed to Mrs. Cooper, - he told me he had come from Mr. Story at the Greyhound in Smithfield, and I was to go back to my mistress, and fetch the things which were named in that note, and he was to take the carpet bag on to Smithfield - I gave him the carpet bag, and took the note back to my mistress - I asked him how he came to know that I was the person - he said, he was told it was a little boy with a carpet bag; when I took the note to Mrs. Cooper, she sent me back to the Greyhound, but I did not find Mr. Story there - about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour had elapsed from the time I saw Smith till I saw 
               
                  James 
                  Stracey
               



             - I had sat down a minute.
Cross-examined. Q. You did not delay longer than that? A. No, I went straight on my errand - it was not more than a quarter of an hour after my master gave me the bag that I gave it to Stracey - it was before half-past twelve o'clock.
COURT. Q. How do you know it was before half-past twelve o'clock? A. It was about a quarter before twelve o'clock when I started; I did not look at any clock, I guessed at the time - I don't know what time the coach was to have started - I am quite sure the two men I have spoken of were Smith and James Stracey - I have no doubt of them whatever.

             (police-constable F 152). On the 27th of July, I was on duty in Holborn and the Strand. I met the three prisoners in Fleet-street, about two o'clock, as I was returning from Clerkenwell prison; my brother officer Brooks was with me - Smith had a bundle under his arm; I suspected them and followed them to Holywell-lane, Shoreditch - they were in conversation at times - Smith there gave the bundle to 
               
                  James 
                  Stracey
               



            , and he crossed Shoreditch, went up Swan-street, and into Anchor-street, where he went into a house, but just before he went in, he looked back - when he went into the house, we went and stood against the door; I saw him go towards the back parlour, but instantly return out again - we stopped him at the door; he had no bundle then - we asked him what the bundle had contained - he said he did not know; that it was given him by a man named Smith to leave there - we took him back into the back room, and found the bundle there and I asked the people of the house if they knew him; they said no - I then asked 
               
                  James 
                  Stracey
               



             if he knew them; he said no, but he had orders to leave the bundle there - I then opened it, and saw it contained gentlemen's wearing apparel; we brought him out, and about twenty yards off, we met the other two prisoners going towards the house where he had been; when they came up I secured Henry Straccy, and my brother officer took Smith - I instantly asked 
               
                  Henry 
                  Stracey
               



             if he knew 
               
                  James 
                  Stracey
               



            ; he said he did not - we then took them to the station-house - I found on Smith this plate of a carpet-bag, with Mr. Story's name on it - this is the bag; it contains the coats, waistcoats, and other articles.
Cross-examined. Q. Was it not an undertaker's house? A. Yes; I was close to the shop when 
               
                  James 
                  Stracey
               



             went in - the door stood open; I saw him go through into the back room, and come out immediately; I did not see him give the bundle to a girl.
CHARLES BROOKS. I was with Tipper - what he has stated is correct - I found these spectacles and a pair of slippers in

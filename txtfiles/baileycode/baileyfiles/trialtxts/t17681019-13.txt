            . I had lost goods several times; I keep a shop, and fell by commission in Leaden-hall-market; I got up on Tuesday morning, and watched while the men were unloading the cart; I saw the prisoner undo a basket and take out four chine bones, the property of Mess. Bell and Goff; he went off, I ran after him, he threw the bones on the ground; I called out stop thief, he was stopped; as we were carrying him to the watch-house he pulled off his coat and ran away; the watchman said it was a small affair, and wanted me to let him go; one of them put his staff cross me in order to throw me down, but I ran and catched the prisoner again by St. Mary Axe church; I found the bones in the same place where the prisoner had throwed them down.

Prisoner's defence.
I was not the man, it was another fellow; I was a watchman in that parish, and was going home at four o'clock when this accident happened; I heard the cry stop thief, and they laid hold of me.

I am a servant to Mr. Smith and Co. on the 20th of August, the things were missed from a package in coming from the wharf: the goods were taken all from one box.

            , haberdasher; on the 20th of August, three boxes were brought in; two of them held ounce thread, the other linen handkerchiefs: that box which had the linen handkerchiefs had been broke open; and that which had ounce thread was broke open in two places; there were 2 doz. handkerchiefs missing, and 2 lb. of thread; there were vacancies that answered the quantity of things taken out.


                  JOHN
                   STAPLETON
               



             sworn.
On Monday the 20th of August, I was at work in my shop, and turning my eye, I saw the taller prisoner in a waggon, trying to open a chest; he had a tool in his hand; I thought he was doing wrong, and I followed the waggon, and then called upon Mr. Lee, and followed the waggon, and saw the left-hand of Juner take out some articles, and then he nailed it down, and Moore came from the head of the horses, and said,
"Nail it down tight;" they stopped at the White Swan, and had some oysters and beer; I got upon the fore-wheel of the waggon, and looked in where the property was lying: the waggon then went on, and stopped at the bottom of Holborn Hill at Mr. Stafford's; and while they were getting out the boxes, I went in and told Mr. Stafford he had been robbed. Mr. Stafford said,
"My lads, this box looks as if it had been opened;" they denied it, and Mr. Stafford had the box opened; I went then into the waggon, and brought this parcel and this bag out of the waggon. Juner was then sent to the Compter, and the other man drove the waggon to Mr. Hillice's; and then Mr. Hillice discovered that both his boxes had been broke open.

             sworn.
I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, and I found this chissel and this hammer on him.

                   LEES
               



             sworn.
On Monday the 20th of August, I saw Juner open a box, and he took out five blue parcels, and put them into a bag; the box was in a waggon. This witnesses's testimony exactly corresponded with Stapleton's.
The prisoners called several witnesses to their characters.

GEORGE JOSEPH FORD. I live in Field-lane


. On the 5th of January, in the evening, I saw the prisoners pass my window two or three times, and told my shopman and apprentice to look after them; these boots were taken from the board at the window - I went out - found Stanton with them under his arm, and Haydon by his side; they were then going up a court into Holborn; I had seen the boots safe ten minutes before; Stanton said, "Let me go, it will be all right;" I took him, and my shopman took Haydon.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoners go up Field-lane twice, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and the second time I heard an alarm that they had stolen the boots; I assisted in taking them to the watch-house; when I got up, Stanton had dropped one boot, and Mr. Ford was taking it up.

            . I received the prisoners in charge at the watch-house; they said they were going to the play, but we found only a few halfpence on them.
STANTON'S Defence. I had been cleaning a chimney which was on fire, and got intoxicated afterwards, and did not know what I was doing.
HAYDON'S Defence. I know nothing about them.

Martin. The Cannister was stole out of my Shop between Ten and Eleven o'Clock at Night, as near as I can guess.
Q. Did you lose any thing besides the Cannister?
Martin. Yes, my Lord, a Pound of Tea in it.
Q. How came you to have it again
Martin. I pursued him.
Q. Then you was in your Shop.
Martin. No, I was in my Parlour; this Gentleman was with me in the Parlour, and he said to me, the Cannister is gone Sir: Upon his saying this, I went out of the Shop, and this Gentleman overtook him. I took up the Cannister after he dropp'd it.

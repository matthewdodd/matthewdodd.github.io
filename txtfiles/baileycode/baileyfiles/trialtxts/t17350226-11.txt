At about eight o'Clock we came into St. Martin's Lane



, where the Prisoner and eight or nine more attacked us, broke the Coach-Doors to pieces, and rescued the Woman. My Hat was beat off in the Fray, and I saw the Prisoner take it up and carry it away.
Prisoner. How can you be sure that I took it when several others were there?
Parr. He staid the last Man of the Mob: The rest were gone a little before when he took my Hat up - When the two Women were in the Round-house that Afternoon, he came several times to them. The last time was about five o'Clock when his Wife bid him make haste: And he answered, I'll be ready for ye, and I warrant ye I'll do your Business.
Several other Witnesses deposed to the same effect, and the Jury found the Prisoner 

               Guilty
             of both Indictments.

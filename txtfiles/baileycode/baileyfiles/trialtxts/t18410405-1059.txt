 for stealing, on the

Samuel Burchfield.






SAMUEL BURCHFEILD
. I am a rope-maker, and live in Penny-fields, Poplar. About eleven o'clock, on the 26th of February, I left my horse and chaise at the gate of St. Katharine's Dock—I left my blue cape in my chaise, and when I returned it was gone—I saw an account in the newspaper, by which I found it.





WILLIAM CHILD
. I am a constable at All-hallows. About eleven o'clock on this day, I saw the prisoner and another going across Trinity-square—the prisoner had this cape on his arm—I knew the other to be a common thief—I followed them—they opened it, and the prisoner said to the other, this will fetch us a funt, which is a flash word for a sovereign—it is a common word among the thieves—I knew what it was, became I had heard it so often—I let them go a little further—I took the prisoner with this—the other ran away.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

JOHN BROW
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 2nd of February, 1 coat, value 55., the goods of 




Thomas Stokes.


THOMAS STOKES. I live in Bedfordshire, and am a wagoner. I was in St. John-street with my wagon last night, and my coat was on it—I left my wagon for five minutes, while I went up an inn yard, and when I came again my coat was gone—this is it—(looking at it.)





JOSEPH WHEELER
. I live at No. 71, Cow Cross-street. About ten minutes past six o'clock, last night, I saw the prisoner coming from St. John-street, with this great coat slung over his shoulder—I went to my master's and heard something—I then went and took the prisoner.

Prisoner. I was coming along, and picked it up—I thought to take it borne and throw it on the bed—the witness and the officer came and took me.





THOMAS STOKES

re-examined. My coat was on the wagon when I left—it could not fall off—I had pushed it under the hoops as tight as I could.




GUILTY
.* Aged 56.—


Transported for Seven Years.

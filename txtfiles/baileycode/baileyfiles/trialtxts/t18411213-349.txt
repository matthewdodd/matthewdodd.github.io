JOHN CRAGGS
. I live in Henry-street, Hampstead-road. I had three bushels of potatoes—they were safe at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, outside the door—about a quarter-past nine o'clock I received information, in consequence of which I went to Fitzroy-place and found them at Dockeray's, and one of my baskets—I believe the potatoes to be mine—this is my basket.





SAMUEL CROFT
. On Friday night I was going on an errand—I saw the prisoner a with a basket of potatoes in Henry-street—Thompson lifted the basket on Holland's shoulder—they went straight down—I am sure Thompson is the person who lifted it on Holland's shoulder.






JOSEPH DOOKERAY
. I am a green-grocer. I was sitting in my room—a roan said, "There is your potatoes all lying about"—I ran out and picked them up—Mr. Craggs came and said they belonged to him—the basket was in the place just past my shop—I do not buy potatoes.

Holland's Defence. I was coming from my aunt's, and the policeman took me for stealing potatoes; I was at Bermondsey at the time they were stolen.

Thompson's Defence. I was with him in Cleveland-street when the policeman came and took us.

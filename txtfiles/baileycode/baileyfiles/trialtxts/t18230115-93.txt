            . I missed this lead about three months since from the roof of a house in Hackney-road


. The prisoner was taken on the 21st of December. I have fitted the lead with the roof, and find it corresponds exactly. The prisoner's father was employed to look after the premises.

"Lead." I found four pieces in the basket,and three in his pocket; they correspond exactly with the prosecutor's premises. I found a hole dug under the foundation of some of the prosecutor's other houses, which lead into the prisoner's father's yard.

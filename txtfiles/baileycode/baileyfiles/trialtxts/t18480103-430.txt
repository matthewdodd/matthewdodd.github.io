Wilsden, 1 watch, value 30s., and 6 sovereigns, the property of

ALFRED GEORGE BARKER
. I keep the Green Man, at Harsden-green, Harrow-road, in the parish of Wilsden—It is my dwelling-house. On Monday, 6th Dec., the prisoner took a night's lodging at our house—I did not know him before—he left on Tuesday morning, about half-past eight—on drawer of a bureau in a room adjoining the one in which he slept—I had seen them safe on the Monday morning.





DARIUS LANGLEY
. I am ostler at the Green Man. The prisoner slept in the same room with me on Monday night, 6th Dec.—I got up before him and left the room—I missed six sovereigns and a watch as I was going to bed on the Tuesday night—I had seen them safe on the Sunday might—they were wrapped in a handkerchief in a box, which was locked—I found the snap of the box broken—this is my watch—(produced).





ANGUS BAIN
 (City policeman, 65.) About a quarter to twelve on Tuesday, 7th Dec., I took the prisoner into custody in Lower Themes-street—I took him to the station, and found on him these two silk handkerchiefs and this watch—he was asked if he had any money—he pulled out four half-crowns and sixpence, and said, "That is all the money I have got;" and on searching him he dropped this purse, containing five sovereigns.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the handkerchiefs; the watch is my brother's; my father gave me the money.

            . I am an upholsterer
, in George-street, Hanover-square


. A person came to the door, and asked me the price of a bedside carpe that hung there, I said eight shillings; he said, he could sell me one cheaper; it appeared to be one that had been stole from me, and I took him up. The other witnesses can give a better account of it than I can.

            . I am servant to Mr. Dobbins, we missed a bedside carpet from the door, about the first of May. On the ninth,

             came and offered it to sell I asked him how he came by it? he said he bought it in a stable-yard in Bond-street, that is, where my master's stable is; I went with him to the stable, and he said, he bought it of Wright, who was our coachman. The coachman owned he sold it to him, and said, that

                  Johnson 
               



             our porter, had gave it him. Then I sent for Johnson, and he owned he gave it to Wright; he said, Wright used to ask him for something to set his feet on, when he went to bed, and he gave it him. They both acknowledged the same before the justice. [Produced in court.] It used to hang by rings, at the corner, by the door, to shew that we sold such things. It is a new one, but the rain had spoil'd the colour of of it. When new, it was worth seven shillings and six-pence.

            . Some time in May, I bought a carpet of Wright, I judge this to be the same, but I will not swear to it I delivered it to the prosecutor; I gave four shillings and six-pence for it. I cry old cloaths about the street; I never saw the coachman before.
Prosecutor. I really believe it to be my coachman's first fault. I cannot say that of the other.
Wright's Defence.
I asked Johnson for a bit of waste oil-cloth, that lay about the warehouse. A little after that I was taken ill of the fever, and Johnson brought three or four shirts, wrapped up in this carpet. My wife went to washing next morning, she saw it, and said, What does this man bring this for? it is of no use to us. A little after that I took and sold it, and an old waistcoat together.
Johnson's Defence.
He asked me for a piece to set his feet upon, and, when he was not well, I took this along with me. I did not know that he sold it, nor did I receive any money for it.

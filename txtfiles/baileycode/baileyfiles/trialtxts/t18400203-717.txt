GEORGE TILT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of January, 15lbs. weight of mutton, value 9s., the goods of 



James Theobald; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL SUTTON
. I live in Robinson's-place, Kingsland, and am a carpenter. I was in my brother-in-law's shop, Mr. James Theobald, on the 26th of January, and hung up a hind quarter of mutton, I saw it safe about eleven o'clock, I afterwards missed it—I saw it on the Monday morning, about nine or ten o'clock—there were marks on it by which I knew it.

Prisoner. He said he could not swear to it; he said he thought it ws his brother-in-law's. Witness. To the best of my belief, it was the same,

and I am positive It was—I said it had been badly chopped down, all the bone was on one side, and the one without bone was the one that was lost.





JEESE PAKES
 (police-constable N 16.) I was on duty in Hertford-road, on Sunday-evening, the 26th of January, and met the prisoner carrying something in his arms—I asked him what he had got—he said, "You know me very well"—I said I did not—he said he had got a hind quarter of mutton, which he got from the Green Man public-house.

Prisoner. I said I got it from the Elephant and Castle public-house; he said, "From Mr. Theobald's," and took me back to Mr. Theobald's; Mrs. Theobald came to the door, and said she knew nothing of it; Mr. Theobald came over after he came home, and said he could not swear to it—I was to have met a young man at a house with it.





HENRY COLEE
. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person—he was ordered to be transported for life.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

            . I am in the employ of Mrs. Showler - I believe her name is Elizabeth, but I never heard her mention it. On the 10th of August I went into the cellar at half-past seven o'clock in the morning - I saw the prisoner, who was in her service, come down, there was no light but what came down the stairs; I saw him draw two ingots of brass from his pocket and place them under the stairs - he went up again; I then looked at them, but did not take any notice; at nine o'clock, which is breakfast time, I saw him go down stairs, wait a few minutes, and then come up and go outat the foundry door; I ran down and missed the ingots; I went out into the street, and brought the prisoner back to my employer - we sent for a Policeman, who found them on him; they are from 11d. to 11 1/2d. per lb. - there are 15 lbs. of them; the prisoner had been there two months.

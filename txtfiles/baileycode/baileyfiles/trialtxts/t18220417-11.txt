            . I am a salesman
, and live in Newgate-market. The prisoner has been my collecting-clerk
 about four years. Mr. Pocklington was indebted to me 16 l. 13 s. 5 d.; the prisoner had to collect it. Tuesday is our collecting-day in the City, and on the Wednesday he went out to collect as usual, and while he was out something occured which induced me to suspect him; and on Thursday I went to Mr. Pocklington - the prisoner was apprehended on the Wednesday; I did not then know of this deficiency. He had not brought Mr. Pocklington's money to account.

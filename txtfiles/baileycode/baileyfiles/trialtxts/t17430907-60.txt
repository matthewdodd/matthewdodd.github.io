, she took me by the Hand, and asked me to give her a Glass of Wine, I pushed her, and called her impudent Creature; when she had got the Ring off my Finger, she let me loose and ran down Paternoster-Row; I pursued her immediately, and she was taken in Paternoster-Row. I am sure she is the Person that took the Ring off my Finger, - I did not touch her any otherwise than by laying held of her to secure her.

I was coming into Paternoster-Row, and I heard a Gentleman call out Watch, I turned about to hear where the Voice came from, and saw the Prosecutor holding the Prisoner by the Hand, and he desired me to lay hold of her for she had taken a Diamond Ring off his Finger of 8 l. value. I took hold of her till the Watchman and other Persons came about her, and then I let her go directly.

               privately stealing a Skin of Morocco Leather value 6 s. in the Shop of 
                     
                        
                           William

, on the 22d of this Instant May
. The Prosecutor deposed, that the Prisoners came into his Shop to cheapen Goods; that Jones pretended to go out to match some Silk while Yeomans bought the Leather, but going the contrary way, he suspected her and brought her back, and took the Skin from under her Petticoat; who then said Yeomans drew her in and betrayed her.

             confirmed the former Evidence; Jones in Excuse said that Yeomans gave her the Leather and bid her go away with it: but Yeomans denied that, or that she knew any thing of her taking it. The Evidence not being sufficent against Yeomans the Jury 


               acquitted
             her, and found Ruth Jones 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

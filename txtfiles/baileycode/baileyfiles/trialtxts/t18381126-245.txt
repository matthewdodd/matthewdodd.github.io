DAVID PHILLIPS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the
 22nd of November, 1 pair of shoes, value 7s.; the goods of 




Robert Williams Peacock.






THOMAS PEACOCK
. I manage the business of my brother Robert Williams Peacock, a boot and shoemaker, in Tooley-street. On Thursday, the 22nd of November, a man came to the shop—I ran out in consequence of what he said, and met the prisoner, near Martin's, the pawnbroker's, in custody—Titchmarsh had the shoes—they were my brother's, and had hung on the door-post, in the street.





THOMAS LEWIS GREEN
. I am seventeen years old, and am in the employ of my brother James, a fishmonger, in Bermondsey-street. On the 22nd of November I saw the prisoner, in company with a young man and a girl—the other young man looked at the shoes several times, and walked about the door with the prisoner, and tried to lift them off the hook—I told Titchmarsh, and he told Mr. Hall—after some time the other young man took them down, and handed them to the prisoner, who put them under his coat, and walked on—they were pursued, and the prisoner was secured with them, and taken into Martin's shop, where I saw the shoes fall down from him.





THOMAS TITCHMARSH
. Green pointed out the prisoner, with a man and woman—I watched them for ten minutes, and saw them get the shoes nearly off the hook—I informed an officer, and went about my business—I

was returning, and Green called to me that they had got the shoes—I then stopped the prisoner, thrust him into Martin's shop, and the shoes fell at his feet—I held him till the officer came up.





SAMUEL JAMES HALL
. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner and the shoes.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prisoner had been in custody more than thirty times.)

Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

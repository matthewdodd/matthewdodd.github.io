MARGARET FAGAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

THIES GLOER
. I am a sailor belonging to the ship Minerva, lying in the London Docks, I met the prisoner on the 24th of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the day-time, and went home with her to her lodging in Blue-gate-fields—we went to bed together—I got up at four o'clock—I cannot tell whether she was with me all the time or not, as I was asleep—when I awoke she was sitting alongside the bed—I then found my clothes were gone—I had paid her what she wanted—that was 1s.—we had had no dispute about what I was to pay her—she was satisfied with that—my jacket and trowsers were gone—I asked her for them—she said, "Go and look for them"—I asked her where I should go and look for them—she said, "Go where you like"—a man then came in, and asked what was the matter—I told him I had lost my clothes—he said, "why

do not you give the man his clothes?"—she said, "Let him go and look for them"—he then struck her, and she gave up the duplicate for the jacket—I gave it to the policeman.





THOMAS WARD
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Ratcliffe-highway. I have the jacket which was pledged by the prisoner, for 5s.





JAMES ROOKE
 (police-constable K 245.) I have the duplicate which was given me by the prosecutor—it is of this jacket.

Prisoner's Defence. He gave me 1s.—I disputed that, and he gave me his jacket to retain till the morning—I went out while he was getting into bed—I stopped out sometime—there are six of the same characters as I am in the house—I know nothing of his trowsers—they were there when I went out—he said he had no more but the shilling he gave me—he had been drinking with me all day.





THIES GLOER
. I did not give the jacket to her—I had more money in my trowsers.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . Q. You are a washer woman - A. Yes. I lost the shirt on the 6th of October. The prisoner came to me a little after eight in the morning. She asked for a little water to wash her her hands, and a brush to brush her petticoat. I went down stairs to borrow one, and during that time she took the shirt off the drawers. I found the shirt where she sold it.
MRS. MAY. I keep a clothes-shop. The prisoner sold the shirt to me. I gave fifteen pence for it. This is the shirt.
Prosecutor. It is my shirt.
Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say.

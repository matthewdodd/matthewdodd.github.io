ROBERT FRAZIER
 was indicted

 for stealing at 
St. Mary Whitechapel, 1 watch, value 7l., the goods of 



John Walker and another, in their dwelling-house.






CHARLES BROWN
. I am in partnership with John Walker, a silversmith, in Whitechapel-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel, it is our dwelling-house. At half-past eight o'clock, on the 8th of March, the prisoner came to our shop—he asked to see a watch that was in the window, marked 7l. 10s.—I showed it to him—he examined it, and said it was too thick for the waistcoat pocket, and asked for one thinner—I showed him one partly silver, and partly gold—he objected to it, and as I was turning to get a gold one, he left the shop, and I missed the watch I had first shown him—I am certain he is the man—there is something peculiar about his eyes and mouth, which enables me to swear to him—he is dressed differently now.

Cross-examined by Mr. DOANE. Q. How soon after did you see him? A. The next day—I have not seen any one else who is confined in this gaol—I swear positively that the prisoner is the man—I had never seen him before.





JOHN KILLING WORTH
. I am foreman to a pawnbroker, at Chelsea. I produce the watch—the prisoner brought it on Saturday night, and wanted 4l. 5s. for it—I had had notice to stop it, and detained him.

Cross-examined. Q. You offered him money while you tent out? A. Yes—I sent a person for an officer—I offered 3l. 10s.—he refused to take it.





JAMES SHEPPARD
 (police-inspector.) I went to the pawnbroker's shop, and questioned the prisoner—he said be bought the watch last night at a coffee-shop in the Strand.
(property produced and sworn to.)





BENJAMIN SWINFIN
. I live at Mr. Walker's—I was there when the prisoner came in to buy a watch—I am sure he is the person.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you any conversation with him? A. No—I see a great many persons.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

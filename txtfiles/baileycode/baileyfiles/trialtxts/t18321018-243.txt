            . On the 13th of October I was in Tothill-street


, and saw a gentleman walking along; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket - he then walked down Princes-street; I followed him, and saw him in the custody of the Policeman: the gentleman was gone when we came, and I charged the prisoner with taking it.
Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Where were you? A. At this end of Tothill-street, on the left hand side, and the prisoner was on the right - I only lost sight of him while he turned the corner to go into Princes-street.

             (Police-constable B 68). In consequence of what Hayes told me I took the prisoner, and found this handkerchief in his right-hand trousers pocket; Hayes said it was the one he took - it is a good silk handkerchief.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the street - the Policeman beckoned to me, and said I had picked a gentleman's pocket - I said I had not; he said "Will you go to the station?" I said I would.

                  WILLIAM 
                  NORTH
               



            . Q. Where do you live - A. No. 104, Bishopsgate without, in the city of London


; I am a potter and glass-seller


.
Q. Who was your partner at the time you lost this property. - A. My sister 
               
                  Frances 
                  Johnson
               



            .
Q. In consequence of information that you received about a gorge, did you go to a public house called the City of Canterbury. - A. I did, on Monday afternoon the 15th of June, it is situated the corner of Primrose-street; I went with my neighbour, we found the stone gorge inside of the pantry door; we took it into the parlour of the public house, and waited there a few minutes, till Sapwell the constable brought the prisoner into the parlour; then I charged the prisoner with stealing it. He began telling a long story about my stopping half a day's wages on the Saturday; he did not deny doing it, but he said how could he live if he did not do something of that kind.
Q. Had you stopped half a day's wages. - A. I had, in consequence of his stopping away half a day; his wages were eighteen shillings a week. After Sapwell delivered him into the care of another officer, I and Sapwell went to his lodgings, he had told me where he lived; we went to No. 9, Read's place, Hoxton; we found the door fast and no person at home; I waited till eleven o'clock, and then we found his wife at home. We searched and found all the articles in the indictment, and a great many more.

                  CROW
               



            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a butcher, I live next door to the prosecutor. In the day mentioned in the indictment I saw the prisoner bring a gorge up the gateway, he brought it from the back door apparently; he then went towards the Canterbury with the gorge; I did not see him go into the City of Canterbury, but I saw him come out of the front door without the gorge; I went and spoke to my next door neighbour; he and I run into the Canterbury and saw a jug, which I supposed to be the same.
MR. CRAIG. I went with Mr. Crow to the City of Canterbury.
Q. Did you see a jug that was in the pantry. - A. I did; afterwards I told the prosecutor, and went with him to the City of Canterbury; the prisoner was brought there, I heard him acknowledge taking it.
(The property produced and identified).
The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

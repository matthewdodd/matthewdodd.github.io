2332. 




JOHN SAUNDERS
 was indicted

for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



William Salmon, and stealing therein, 1 waistcoat, value 22s., his goods.






WILLIAM SALMON
. I am a tailor, and live in Theobald's-road, in the parish of St. George the Martyr. On Saturday evening, the 19th of September, from half-past eight to nine o'clock, I was at home—the prisoner was brought into my shop with a waistcoat, which is my property—it had been on a brass rod inside the shop window—there were more articles taken—I looked at the window, and found it was broken—there was a crick in the pane before—I was in the shop when it happened—I did not hear any smash—it was merely cracked in the middle, and the putty at both tides was perfectly secure—it could not have fallen out—I was very buy at the time, and it might be broken without my hearing it—I rent the house.





CHARLES MEIKLE
. I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I was sitting in the shop on Saturday evening, and heard the glass crack, as if it was an umbrella went against it—I went to the door, and saw somebody run down Harper-street—I came in and sat down again, and in a few minutes heard another crack—I ran out, and saw the prisoner drop the waistcoat and a small cane—he was stopped by a boy, and brought in—I ran out and brought in the waistcoat, which was four or five feet from the window—the person I saw running the first time was about the prisoner's size.





GEORGE HESLOP
. I took the prisoner in charge.




GUILTY of Larceny only. Aged 10.—


Transported for Seven Years to the Prison Ship.

Before Mr. Baron Gurney.

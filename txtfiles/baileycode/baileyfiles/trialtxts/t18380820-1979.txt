On the night of the 17th of August, about seven o'clock, I went out—I locked my door and left the key in it—my wife was up stairs—I left a watch and stand in the house—I was not absent two minutes—I had seen the prisoner about an hour before-when I opened my door I found him coming out of my room—I immediately missed the watch, and charged him with it—he said he had it, and I might have it if I let him go—he had it in his bag, stand and all—this is it—(looking at it.)

            . I was at the Bull's Head at Old Brentford


, on the 17th of September. I fell asleep in the kitchen, between the hours of two and four, in which time I lost my watch, 2 Bath metal one. I had seen the prisoner there before I went to sleep; when I awaked and missed it, he was gone. I followed him, and met with him at the sign of the Still at New Brentford, with my watch upon him. I took him before a Justice of the Peace; there he owned he took it. ( Produced and deposed to.)

            . I was along with 
               
                  James 
                  Davis 
               



             at the Bull's Head; after he fell asleep, I went out to the coach I drive; I had been gone to the turnpike about an hour and a half; he came to me, and asked me if I knew who had his watch? I went to the tap-house, and asked Mr. Gurney, the Master of the house; both he and his wife said they did not know who took it. Then Mr. Davis and I pursued, and found the prisoner at the Still at New Brentford, and found the watch upon him: we took him to the Justice, where he confessed he did take it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have nothing to say. I beg the mercy of the court. I was much in liquor.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately from his person

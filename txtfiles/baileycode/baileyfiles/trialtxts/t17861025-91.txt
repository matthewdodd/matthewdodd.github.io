             sworn.
I am a publican; I live in Bambridge-street; on the 13th of September, I went and looked through the prisoner's door, and I saw this quart pewter pot in this frying pan, and the prisoner blowing at the fire; then I opened the door and took her; and took up the pot, and said to the prisoner, now madam, are you frying pots or not; she said, no, she was making water gruel; says I, it is very fine water gruel, when pewter pots turn into oatmeal; I drove her before me to the Justice.
(The pot deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I found the pot covered over with straw, and was going to take it to the owner, and I took the pot home in my hand first to get a bit of victuals; the pot was not near the frying pan.

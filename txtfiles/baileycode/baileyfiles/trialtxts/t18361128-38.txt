38. 




WILLIAM KRIEGBOURN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of May, 3 shillings, 1 sixpence, and 2 pence; the monies of 



Frederick Kuhn, his master.






FREDERICK KUHN
. I am a baker. The prisoner was my servant for two years and three months—he took the money for about sixteen bills.





GEORGE GRAY
. I live with the prosecutor. On the 16th of May I paid the prisoner 3s. 8d. on account of his master.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. What do you mean by paying him a bill?—he was your fellow servant. A. Yes—he said it was master's order that I should pay it to him—I was ten weeks in the prosecutor's service—I left on the 4th of July, and I am now in another service—I got the bill from the prisoner—I took it to Mr. Gray, who paid me 3s. 8d., and I gave the money to the prisoner—Mr. Gray continued to be a customer, and had weekly bills sent to him.

COURT
to
MR. KHUN. Q. Did you tell the prisoner he was to get this 3s. 6d. from Gray? A. No, it is false—he never gave me that money.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you not some period for accounting with your servants? A. Yes, regularly—I made inquiry about this, and the prisoner told me Mr. Gray did not pay any—I made four bills—I gave the prisoner 15s. a week—I paid him regularly every month—I am quite sure it never ran longer—I might perhaps be from home, but my men are paid regularly.
(MR. DOANE, on behalf of the prisoner, urged that, not receiving his wages regularly, he was induced to keep the money, intending to account for it afterwards.)




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were three other indictments against the prisoner.)

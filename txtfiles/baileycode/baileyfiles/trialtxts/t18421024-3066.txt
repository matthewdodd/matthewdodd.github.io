CHARLES ALLEN
 was indicted

 for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



Thomas Frankcombe, on the 
16th of October, at 
St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, and stealing therein, 1 gown, value 10s.; 1 shirt, value 3s.; 1 shift, value 1s.; and 1 apron, value 6d.; the goods of the said Thomas Frankcombe.






JANE FRANKCOMBE
. I am the wife of Thomas Frankcombe, and live in Union-place, by the Queen's Bench prison, in the parish of St. George-the-Martyr—it is our dwelling-house. On Sunday evening, the 16th of October I left home about twenty minutes past eight o'clock—I locked the door—I returned in a quarter of an hour, and found the door had been opened, and was bolted inside—I gave an alarm—I looked up stairs, saw a light, and the shadow of a man—I went for a policeman—when I got in I found these things taken from one box, and placed on the lid of another—the policeman burst the door open.





THOMAS FRANKCOMBE
. In consequence of information I got on the wall, and saw a man getting over the palings between my house and Cooper's—I ran round, and found the prisoner in custody of Cooper, four doors off—I saw no one but him.





GEORGE COOPER
. I heard an alarm of "Stop thief," and in a little time I heard a noise in my back yard, which adjoins Mr. Frank combe's—I went out, and saw the prisoner in my yard—I took hold of him, and said, "You villain, what do you do here?"—he said, "I have done nothing."

Prisoner's Defence. There were two or three of us; we had a drop of drink, and got larking; one of them chucked my hat over the fence, and I got over after it. I got it, and wished to get away, as I heard a cry of "Police."

            's; I have a room to myself; my room was locked; I was at a public house just by drinking a pint of beer; I left the lock quite fast and found it broke; it was entirely taken away; I never saw it from that time to this. I lost fourteen pair of breeches, two pair unfinished, and some pieces of leather; this room is my shop and place where I live.
Q. What time did you have work that night?
Leveridge. It was Sabbath-day night, so I did not work; I locked my door at half after nine and went out; I returned about eleven and found it in that condition. There were people passing and repassing in the street; I called there in and told them I was robbed. Some of the things are in Court.

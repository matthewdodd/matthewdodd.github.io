            . I am in the employ of Mr. Henry Bardwell, a woollen-draper
, of Holborn-bridge


. On the 3rd of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came for some patterns of waistcoats, and then he asked me to show him some coatings, which I did - he then desired to see another piece, which I showed him; he asked for patterns of them, and went out - my master came in at that moment, and said that, "That man is no better than he ought to be;" I then looked, and missed a piece of blue kerseymere - I went out, and found the prisoner in Cock-lane; I asked if he had a piece of blue kerseymere; he said No - I saw his hat stood rather high on his head; I took it off, and found in it this kerseymere, which is my master's - I did not know the prisoner.

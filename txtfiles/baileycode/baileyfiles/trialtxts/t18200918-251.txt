                  , from his person

                  JOHN 
                  TEASDALE
               



            . I am clerk
 to Messrs Crosby and Co. St. John-street. On the 15th of July, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was walking along Devonshire-street, Portland-road


; I saw the glass-blowers' procession, and stopped to look at them. A person who is not apprehended, came up and hit me a blow in my neck; I should know him again - I felt it for some moments. At the same time he snatched at my watch; the chainbroke, and he got the seals and key; he then handed it either to Edwards or Wherry, which I cannot say - they were immediately behind him in his company. I seized the man who struck me, and called for assistance. I was beset by several of them, and had stones and other things thrown at me - I still held the man until I was knocked down by several - I saw Wolfe among them. When they had partly dispersed, I got up and found several more hustling me to get my pocket-book. I got away as quick as I could - I was obliged to escape through a gateway into a marble-yard for safety. In an hour or two, I saw Edwards and Wherry among a crowd near White Conduit-house - I pointed them out to Smith; they were then secured. I seized Edwards myself, and gave him to Smith - they both ran away as they saw me with Smith and other officers - they were secured near thirty yards off. When I was in Portland-road, I had a second scuffle with the man I at first seized, and who had been rescued from me. I was struck at several times, and saw Wherry about the crowd. While I was being hustled, I felt a hand in my coat-pocket; as soon as I could turn round, I saw Wolfe was nearest behind me, and several loose papers about his feet, which were taken from my pocket. I was very much beaten. He was apprehended the next day. The second attack was twenty or thirty yards from where the first was.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether Wherry or Edwards took the seals from the man, you cannot say - A. No, he extended his hand towards them. They were among the crowd while I was being beat - they threw stones at me; one of the stones hit me in the neck. They were along with the man at the time he robbed me.

                  SMITH
               



            . I am keeper of St. Pancras watch-house. I was at White Conduit-house, and saw Mr. Teasdale at the top of the hill; he pointed out Edwards and Wherry among a gang of nine or ten. Edwards turned round and looked, and the whole gang ran off different ways. I followed and secured Edwards - he made great resistance. I told him he was a pickpocket - he then fought very hard, and one of those behind me struck me. As soon as I got hold of him, he whipped his hand into his pocket. I took two seals and a broken ring out of his hand; they have not been owned; he was trying to throw them away. I took him to the watch-house, and the other two were delivered to me.

            . I am a broker. A gentleman was robbed on the hill near White Conduit-house. While another of the gang was being taken to the watch-house, some persons came up and said they had been robbed. I went to White Conduit-house, and we took fifteen pickpockets.

            . I am a vellum-binder, and live in Field-lane. I came up the Portland-road directly after Mr. Teasdale was robbed, and followed him down the road to White Conduit-house. I first caught sight of Wherry and Edwards about a quarter of a mile off, in company together with several others. I saw Smith searching Edwards, and assisted in taking some of the gang.

            . I am a constable. Wherry and Edwards passed me at the corner of Cumming-street, when I was going to Clerkenwell with a prisoner. As I returned I assisted in securing a gang of fifteen, among whom were the prisoners.

            . I am a constable. I received the whole gang in custody, and found a small necklace on Wherry.

            . I assisted in securing the gang; they were being taken into a public-house, a mob of about 150 came round, and threatened to pull the house down.

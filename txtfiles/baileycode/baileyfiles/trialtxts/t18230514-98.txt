ANY HANCOCK. I am a widow

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the morning of the 8th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoners following a van, which was loaded with furniture; I followed them for twenty minutes. Jones took the trunk out of the tail of the van, and came on the footpath to Freeman, and delivered it to him; he received it from him and was walking away. I seized Jones, and told a person to stop Freeman, which he did, and I took the trunk from him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
FREEMAN'S Defence. I was looking for work, and met Jones's who asked if I wanted a job, and gave me 1 s. to carry this trunk.

THOMAS HARRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

JOSEPH BUTLER ROSS
. I live in Holland-street, Brixton-road. On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, about four o'clodk, I was in Red-cross-street—I missed my pocket-handkerchief—I saw the prisoner is custody some time after—this handkerchief now produced is the one I lost.





GEORGE MERCER
. I was in Red cross-street. I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Ross's pocket—I gave information to the police—I did not pursue—I saw him go down Fishmonger-alley.





HENRY HART
 (police-constable M 80.) I received information, and took the prisoner out of a house in Fishmonger-alley—I saw him attempt to conceal the handkerchief in his breast, as he was going into the house, but when he was brought out the handkerchief was missing—he had chucked it down among some grains in the passage.





JOHN HARVEY
 (police-constable L 85.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

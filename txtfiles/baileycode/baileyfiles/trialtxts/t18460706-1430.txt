JOHN LYON
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 boxes, value 2s.; 1 pair of ear-drops, 1s. 6d.; and 2 necelaces, 1s. 6d.; the goods of 



Francis Baggs; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







MARY BAGGS
. I am the wife of Francis Baggs; we keep a lodging-houx in Orchard-street, Westminster. On Saturday, the 13th of June, the prisoner came to lodge there—he staid till Monday, the 15th, when I went out, leav-ing him in my parlour—I went into the yeard for ten or eleven minutes—when I returned he was gone, and I missed a small mahogany work-box—I had a tortoiseshell box in it, with a pair of ear-rings, two necklaces, a brooch, and several other things, and some duplicates—I went to get an affidavit at the pawnbroker's on the Tuesday, and saw the prisoner near the station—I gave him in charge—I said to him, "What an unfortunate man you are to take my box"—he said he took it because he thought there was money in it, and if I would forgive him he would give me the box again—he said he had broken the box and hid it—he offered me and the policeman to go with us where he had hid it—we went, and he could not find it—this is my brooch—I saw the policeman find it in the prisoner's pocket—my box had been locked.





GEORGE BODDINGTON
 (police-constable B 184.) I took charge of the pri-soner—the prosecutrix asked him how he came to take her the box again; that he had broken it open and hid it under the arch near Vauxhall-bridge, and if we would go with him he would find it—we went with him after I had the inspector's order—we did not find the box—he led us about for an hour and a half and more—first he said it was here and then there.





GEORGE BANHAM
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerken well—(read—Convicted 18th Nov., 1845, confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

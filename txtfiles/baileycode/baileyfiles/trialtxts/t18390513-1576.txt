MR. ESPINASSE
conducted the Prosecution.






ELIZABETH COLEMAN
. I am the wife of William Coleman, and live in Pelham-crescent, Brompton. The prisoner was about fifteen days in our service, and was discharged about the 20th of April—shortly afterwards I missed a table-cloth, and on searching further missed other articles—I gave instructions to the police, and have seen all the articles since—(looking at them)—all these articles are our property—they belong to me and my children—she might have taken articles of much greater value from where she took these.





JOSEPH NEAL
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody at No. 82, Park-street, Kensington, concealed at the bottom of the bed, under the clothes—I told her what I took her for—she immediately went into hysterics—when she recovered she told me part of the property was at a beer-shop about a hundred yards off, and at other places—I found some of the property there—I found one of her boxes at the beer-shop, and the rest at No. 82, Park-street—they contained the various articles which the prosecutrix claimed.

Prisoner. I beg for mercy.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

             sworn.
I am shopman to the prosecutor, No. 46, New Bond-street


, a linen-draper
. On the 8th of May, I was engaged in a back shop: I saw a suspicious man go past the door; I watched him, and the prisoner came in, took this piece of nankeen off the counter, and ran off with it; I followed him, and took him with it under his coat: I carried him and the nankeen to the justice; this is the same piece.
(Deposed to, marked K. O.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Coming past the door, a man offered me six-pence to fetch it out; I was very hungry, and took it out; I never did such a thing before; I would not send for my friends, to disgrace them.

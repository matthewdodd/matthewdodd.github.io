                  William
                   Phillips
               



            . I lately lived with Mr. Palmer in Queen's-street, Cheapside


; there lived with him one 
               
                  John
                   Davis
               



            , 
               
                  John
                   Tonner
               



             and Daniel; the two prisoners lived with him at that time; the first day I came there I was employed in scouring copper plates; I came there about a quarter of a year ago; the next business I did was to pull at the fly.
Q. A fly of what?
Phillips. I never heard any name to it; it was cutting copper pieces; we called them buttons; they were to be half-pence; the fly was made use of in striking them; I have seen them out in the yard.
Q. What part did the other men do?
Phillips. We were not particular in our branches when we came to be used to it; one knew as well others; we were employed about seven weeks.
Q. How many did you make in a day?
Phillips. We counted for a couple of plates to be a piece, which cut 24 s. worth, that was a guinea's worth; we made eleven pieces to the amount of eleven guineas worth a day.
Q. For how long time was it you thus continued employed?
Phillips. Two months; sometimes we composed our day's work by four or five o'clock; it was eleven pieces. Palmer used to take out some himself; I believe I carried some out to a place I discovered to Mr. Gates; I do not know the name of it. The tools were removed from London to a house at Kensington Gravel Pits


; I went along with them when they were moved; it might be about three weeks or a month before we were taken up.
Q. Whose house was that to which they were removed?
Phillips. I know the house but do not know whose house it is: I had half a guinea a week, meat, drink and lodging; all the striking part was done at Kensington.
Q. Did you compleat them entirely the time you struck them?
Phillips. Yes.
Q. Did Davis to?
Phillips. Yes.
Counsel. They are good looking halfpence; they are very little inferior to good money; there is one where the die has missed.
Cross Examination.
Q. You were all of you but a sort of journeymen?
Phillips. Yes, to one Palmer.
Q. Was not Palmer used to tell you that he was a button-maker? what trade did Palmer profess himself to be?
Phillips. I do not know.
Q. They were made under the notion as buttons?
Phillips. Yes.
Q. What did he pay you your half guinea in?
Phillips. Always in gold?
Q. Have you ever seen these men work at that fly?
Phillips. Yes.
Q. Was Davis employed in any thing more than carrying out parcels?
Phillips. Yes, the same as we all; we were employed equally.
Mr. Serjeant Davy. You know a halfpenny from a button when you see it?
Phillips. Yes.

Q. Now were they halfpence or buttons?
Phillips. They were halfpence I called them.


                  Thomas
                   Gates
               



            . On the 8th of May I had a warrant to search a house in Queen street, Cheapside. I went to No. 27 in St. Thomas the Apostle, in Queen-street; the house was shut up, and there was no one in it. A week after I had an information that persons were in the house; I went there and found 
               
                  Joseph
                   Gates
               



             and 
               
                  John
                   Evans
               



            ; I saw Phillips, and Tonner the prisoner; they were removing a grindstone in the cellar; I observed on the floor of the cellar a plank of wood fixed in the ground where something had been fixed of a machine for stamping; I then went up into the garret; I asked them what they were doing; they said they were only porters hired by a gentleman in Fleet-street that day; they said they did not know him; I asked where they lay; they said in a hay field; I searched them, and found near 3 l. a piece upon each of them, gold and other money; I asked them where they were going to remove to; they said a cart and horses was waiting in Black Friars to receive them; that they had been with other thing with a knot to Black Friars, and there found the cart and horse; I went there with them, and waited for the cart and horse; nobody came to it; then I sent it to the Green yard, and took the two men to the Compter. I went up stairs before, and found two forms that were in the garret with a quantity of nine sand for casting metals. I said they should go to different prisons, and then Phillips confessed there was an information made, and in consequence of it I went to Kensington; Palmer was removed there; it was on the 16th at night, near ten o'clock; we went to Kensington and took Phillips with us; we rang a great while at the door and nobody came; I then put my hand through the gate, lifted up the latch and got into the yard; they assisted me and we broke the door open; I went and searched all over the house and there was nobody in it; we found a wheel (producing it) for the purpose of polishing brass: after they are punched out by one instrument the roughness is taken of and they are brightened by that wheel. I found a quantity of blanks for half-pence not stamped (producing some of them); I found the wheel in the fore cellar; it was lined with leather; they put emery and oil in it, and turn it round, and their own weight on the leather brightens them.
Q. Were any of the back door open?
Gates. I believe they went out at the back door as we went in at the fore door. This scoter ( producing it) I found in the out house; it marks the width of the halfpence, and then they cut it with shears. We found this (producing a large engine with a fly to it) that cuts the halfpence out of the slips of copper; we found it in the stable. We found a back door into another stable, that we broke open; there we found a stamping machine; we also found a quantity of blank dyes, 50 I suppose; there is no impression on them. We stayed in the house four or five hours at least before we got the things into a cart to get them away to the Mansion House. When I came away I left Burton, Wilson and Evans in the house. There is always three persons employed to work the machine with the fly; one stands at each end of the fly, and one puts the copper under; it cannot be worked without three persons.
Q. You found all these things by the direction of Phillips?
Gates. Yes; Phillips gave an account of them before we went; every thing tallied very minutely with the account he gave. There is a quantity of new halfpence I found under the stamping instrument.
Cross Examination.
Q. All these things you are talking of were found in the house of Mr. Palmer?
Gates. Yes; I found the act of parliament in one of Mr. Palmer's pockets in the house at Kensington.


                  Hannah
                   Turvey
               



            . I live with Mr. Page, a wine merchant, No. 26, Queen-street, Cheapside, next door to the place in question.
Q. Did you live there in last May?
Turvey. Yes. I have seen Tonner at Palmer's several times; the other I do not know that I ever saw.
Q. Did you ever see or hear any thing going on?
Turvey. This day five weeks I went to the door to let two gentlemen in, and saw a cart and horses; they were going to remove that night; it was the day before Mr. Gates came; I saw several things, I could not think what they were; there were two men, I cannot say who they were; the last thing that came out was a box, and instead of pitching it in the cart they pitched it beside the cart, and it broke open and some things came out; I took one up; it was copper the size of a halfpenny; there was neither head nor tail on it; there was about a hatful fell out; I asked them what they were; they said they were tops of buttons.
Q. Who said that?
Turvey. The man that drove the cart. I used now and then to hear a dead knock.
Q. Was the knock often repeated?
Turvey. I used to hear it several times.
Q. Pray did you ever hear any thing particular besides?
Turvey. No.
Cross Examination.
Q. You know nothing at all of those men that were removing that night?
Turvey. No.


                  Edward
                   Wilson
               



            . I went to Kensington with Mr. 
               
                  Joseph
                   Gates
               



             and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Gates
               



            ; we searched the house; I stayed in the house after Gates went away. About five in the morning Davis came to the outer gate, and put his hand through the iron gate to lift the latch up; Evans saw him come in and told me of it, and called Jack, Jack, run to the door, I believe there is one of the men there; I ran to the door, and saw Davis there; I asked him what he wanted; he said to speak to the master of the house; I asked him what he wanted with him; he said he had done some work for him and wanted to be paid for it; I bid him follow me round to the back part, and he did very quietly, and 
               
                  John
                   Evans
               



             met us at the farm yard gate, and we both conducted him through the stable gate, and brought him to the place where the instruments were knocked up or struck up, and he said, what have I done? we took him into the kitchen and bid him sit down in the chair.
Q. What answer did you make to him when he said what had he done?
Wilson. I said nothing at all. When he sat in the chair he made directly at the tongs; I laid hold of him then, and secured him that he should not do any mischief; with that he threw 
               
                  John
                   Evans
               



             on one side while he had the tongs in his hand, and he wanted to get away from me; a little man that assisted us with the poker struck Davis on the arm and the head, and knocked him down; then I tied Davis by the wrist, and carried him to Baize-Water; when he came there he was saint with the loss of blood; he had lost near a quart; I gave him part of two pots of beer, and brought him to town; he came quietly till he came near Bow-street; I sent for a coach and he got away, and ran up George-street, and got the handkerchief off his wrist; I pursued him, and cried stop thief! and took him again, and got a coach and carried him to the Poultry Compter.


                  John
                   Evans
               



            . I was one of the persons left behind by Mr. Gates: I was up one pair of stairs and saw Davis come to the gate, and put his hand through to try to open the gate; I suspected him to belong to them; I called out to Wilson to run as fast as he could to the gate, and we secured him; this was about five o'clock in the morning.


                  Joseph
                   Sage
               



            . I am a moneyer in the Mint.
Q. Have you seen the press and things?
Sage. Yes, I have looked at them all.
Q. Are they fit for coining halfpence?
Sage. They will coin halfpence, silver, or gold, or any thing.
Q. Is the mill fit for cleaning of halfpence?
Sage. Yes.
Tonner's Defence.
The gentleman hired me as a porter
; all I did was to clean knives and carry out parcels: I had ten shillings a week; I had no bed there till the evidence was hired; then he desired me and his servants to lie together.
Davis called three witnesses, and Tonner five, who gave him a good character.
Both 

               guilty

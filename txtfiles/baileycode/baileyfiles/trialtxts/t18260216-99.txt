            . I was on the Green - I saw Mr. Browning - the prisoner and another were following him - the other took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner, who put it into his pocket; I took him - and took it from his breeches-pocket - there was a fire there, and I saw him very distinctly; he was a stranger to me.

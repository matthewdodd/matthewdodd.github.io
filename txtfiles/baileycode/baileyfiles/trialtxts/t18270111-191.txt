            . I am an officer in the East India Company's service
. I live at No. 8, College-street, East, Camden Town


. The female prisoner was occasionally employed at my house as a charwoman

; when she left the house on the 18th of December, I heard these articles were gone; I had seen the shoes safe the day before, but had not seen the spoons that I know of - I did not see the female prisoner at the house that day, but heard she had been there.


                  MARY 
                  GORDON
               



            . I am in the service of Mr. Maclagan.

             came to the house as charwoman, and was there on the 18th of December - the man came there that evening at eight o'clock; Julia was then in the front kitchen by the window - I told her he was there - she went out of the kitchen into the area - took a chair with her, and gave the key to her husband - she then took up the shoes and gave them to him; I was in the front kitchen, and saw through the window that it was 
               
                  John 
                  Cole
               



             who took the shoes - he came to her for the key of their lodgings - she gave him that out of her pocket - I had opened the street-door to him, then went down and told her he was there - she went into the area and gave him the key - I was in the front kitchen when she gave him the key and shoes; I then went into the back kitchen - I heard the woman knocking the spoons about - I went and said she should not knock them about so - she then took one of the saucepans and gave it out to her husband - she then took up a silver table spoon and gave that to him - I had then gone into the front kitchen, and remained there till it was all over - I then returned to the back kitchen - she came and asked me not to tell, and said she would give me a cotton box - the shoes were my master's and had been up in his room.

            . I was not in the front kitchen - there was no fire there. Witness. There was no fire - but you were there. There was a knock at the door - I went up, but nobody was there - but afterwards John Cole knocked, and I went up again.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Smellee, a pawnbroker; here is a pair of shoes pawned by the female prisoner, on the 19th of December. I am sure of her person.

            . He is not the person I saw when I pawned them. Witness. This duplicate is my own hand writing, and I am certain I took them from her.

            . I am an officer. I went and took the prisoners at their lodgings, in Pratt-street - I found a duplicate of the shoes on the female prisoner, but cannot trace the spoons.
Mr. MACLAGAN. Gordon did not tell me of this till next morning - I then looked and missed a table spoon, two tea spoons, and the shoes.

            . We were both at the Maidenhead public-house, and there we bought the shoes - if I had known they were stolen, I should not have kept the duplicate about me - I gave it up to the officer - he did not take it from me. I declare I never stole the plate- I went up to my mistress and took what plate I could find, and said, "Have the kindness to count it," which she did, and said, there was a fish-slice, two tea and a table spoon missing - I went down and found them - I took them all up - she counted them, and said they were all right.


                  JAMES 
                  BROWN
               



            . She did not give it me till after I had searched the place very minutely.


                  JAMES 
                  WILKINS
               



            . I am a carpenter, and live in King-street, Camden-town - 
               
                  John 
                  Cole
               



             was my journeyman. He was in my company on that Monday, from half-past seven in the morning till half-past ten o'clock at night - he was at work with me at a house in Stoke Newington - we worked by candle-light, and left work at half-past six o'clock, then went to the Maidenhead public-house, Battle-bridge, and there we remained till half-past ten; there were several other persons in the house, but no one in our company - I do not recollect seeing the landlord - I saw the waiting-maid - it is a house I chiefly use - Cole and I used to go there when he worked for me.
Q. Why are you so sure it was Monday, the 18th of December? A. Because I keep an account in my book of the work I do - I have no doubt that was the day - we worked there the day following and the Saturday before; I had been working there two months only - my apprentice, John Bond, worked with me; he is not here - he is eighteen years old - there is nobody here from the public-house.
MR. MACLAGAN. My Lord, this witness called at my house and merely stated that Cole was a very honest man, and he had known him a long time - he did not state a word about his being at work with him.
COURT to 
               J. WILKINS
            . Q. Did you call at Mr. Maclagan's? A. Yes; after I heard what had happened I called on Mr. Maclagan's, and told him he had worked with me the whole of Monday - I went on the Wednesday evening - I heard that evening there had been a robbery, but did not know when it had been committed.
Q. And yet you told him he had worked with you the whole of Monday? A. He worked with me the whole of that day - I told Mr. Maclagan he had worked with me the whole of Monday; I told him so at his street door; I remember particularly telling him so there; no one was present.
Q. Did you tell him he had worked with you on Saturday? A. No; I do not know that I had any particular reason for telling him he had worked with me on Monday, but I knew the man could not be at the place he was at, and the other place too.
Q. Now I again ask you on your oath, whether you knew the charge was on the Monday? A. No.
Q. Do you expect the Jury to believe you should mention that the prisoner was with you on the Monday; and yet you did not know the robbery was on that day? A. No, I did not - I only know that on the Wednesday morning I sent my boy to call him as usual, and he put his head out of the window and said he would follow us - we went on, he did not come, and in the evening I heard of the robbery when I came home; but I did not hear when it was.

J. BROWN
            . When I apprehended the prisoner, I asked him if he was at work - he said he had been out of work a good deal, and that on the Saturday night before he had had 5s. of his master and had not gone to him since.
MR. MACLAGAN. When this witness called on me, he came into the passage - my sister was at the parlour door at the time.
COURT to 
               J. WILKINS
            . Q. You say you told Mr. Maclagan at his door that the prisoner was at work with you on the Monday? A. Yes, I did - I did not see Mr. Maclagan's sister there - there was nobody there - Mr. Maclagan opened the door - I stood, and spoke to him - I did not go there more than once on any occasion.


                  CATHERINE

            . I was at the parlour door when Wilkins came to our house; he gave a loud knock at the door, which alarmed us - he came into the passage and I heard all that passed between my brother and him - he did not state that Cole had worked with him on theMonday - he spoke in a very rude manner - he said he came to give the prisoner a good character - he did not say a word about where he had been on the Monday.

            . Q. Did not you send the girl down for the spoons, and I went and asked you to count them; and when I had got them all, you said they were perfectly right? A. It is not a word of it true; I never sent for them; you never asked me if they were right.

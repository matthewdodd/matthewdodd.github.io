                  William 
                  Pickering 
               



            . I am a carman
, the prisoner had been my servant
 about fourteen or fifteen days; I sent him to Drury-lane with my cart and two horses to fetch a load of tallow to St. Giles's-pound on the 4th of December; I never saw the prisoner till after I had advertised them; I found them at 
               
                  Godfrey 
                  Gilbert 
               



            's at Windmill-hill near Bunhill-fields. I ordered him to come home after he had done the jobb. I went, and with a search-warrant got them again; Gilbert said he had bought them of the prisoner.
Q. Was the cart marked?
Pickering. Yes, my name was upon three places, and the number upon it.
Q. Was you acquainted with 
               
                  Godfrey 
                  Gilbert 
               



             ? Pickering. He knew me very well.


                  Isaac 
                  Watson 
               



            . I found the prosecutor's cart and horses at 
               
                  Godfrey 
                  Gilbert 
               



            's, the cart was in the yard, and the horses in the stable. I was with the prisoner in Ludgate, he owned he was a rogue, but 
               
                  Godfrey 
                  Gilbert 
               



             was a bigger, for he know the horses and cart were Mr. Pickering's.


                  Robert 
                  Biggs 
               



            . On the 4th of December I heard Mr. Pickering say to the prisoner, go to Drury-lane and fetch a load of tallow: he went through Bow-yard, Mrs. Pickering said, that is the wrong way. He said it is the right way to where I am going. I went to the prisoner in Ludgate, and I asked him how he could go to sell Mr. Pickering's cart and horses? he said, I own I am a rogue, but Gilbert is a bigger, for once before I sold him a cart and two horses for three guineas and half, and he sold one of the horses for six pounds, and what he did with the cart and other horse he did not know. He said then he had sold these, and he had taken two guineas of the money, if not more; Watson was with us at the same time.
Q. to Watson. What did you hear the prisoner own ?
Watson. I cannot recollect any thing more than I said before; Biggs was there at the time.
Q. Did you hear him say he had any money of Gilbert ?
Watson. He said he had two guineas of him in part for the cart and horses, and that he had sold them to him.
Prisoner's defence.
When I went there the jobb was not ready, and I was arrested and carried away to Ludgate. I had two guineas of 
               
                  Godfrey 
                  Gilbert 
               



            's.




               Guilty of stealing the cart and harness only
            .

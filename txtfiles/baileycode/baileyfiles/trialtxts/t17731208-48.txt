            's, in the parish of St. John's Hackney



; I was at Chelsea at the time they were lost; when I came to town I missed them. The prisoner was a servant out of place; she used to come backwards and forwards to the house every day, and often lay in the house; she has since passed as a lady of great fortune. I found the gloves at her lodgings, Mr. Talboys in the Strand. She never owned any thing. (The gloves produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)


                  Ann
                   Gilbert
               



            . I am daughter to Mr. Gilbert; Mrs. Hunt lived with my father.
Q. What was she, a servant, or what?
Gilbert. No.
Q. Do you know of her having lost any thing out of the house?
Gilbert. Her gloves, her stays, and her handkerchief.
Q. Did you see them there?
Gilbert. Yes.
Q. When?
Gilbert. I cannot say when I did see them; they were all honest people in the house; there were two lodgers that had missed things.
Q. to Harriot Hunt. Where did you find your stays?
Hunt. I found nothing but the black silk gloves.
- Talboys. The prisoner came to lodge at my house, under the character of a woman of fortune; she took my apartment for a twelvemonth certain; she said her affairs were under the hands of Alderman Thomas and Alderman Turner. When she had been in my house about a fortnight I missed some of my property.
Court. Do not speak to that.
Talboys. I enquired after Mr. Hunt, and one Mrs. Hughes, where she had lodged; I enquired after her by the name of Hunt; she did not know her by that name; she knew her by the description I gave of her; I went to Mr. Hunt's; I saw Mrs. Gilbert; she asked me if I saw a pair of stays there; I said, yes.
Prisoner's Defence.
They have got my clothes and things; I am not guilty; my witnesses are not ready.

                  James
                   Talboys
               



            . The prisoner lodged at my house; she came there on the 6th of October; the things mentioned in the indictment were found between the sacking and the ticking of the bed in the room the prisoner occupied.


                  Margaret
                   Talboys
               



             Under the bed where the prisoner lodged I found most articles mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.) I found a pair of clogs in the closet where the coals were kept; some pieces of linen were found in her pockets at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; I can swear to this piece; I cut it off a child's gown in order to make it short. I lost a queen Ann's half crown. She came on the 6th of October; her lodgings were at three shillings and sixpence a week.


                  Thomas
                   Bull
               



            . I am a constable: I searched the bed; when I found this piece upon her, Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             bid me search her lodgings.
Prisoner's Defence.
The things were found in my room; I never put them there; it was a week after I was in custody they wanted me to give them a guinea to make them satisfaction for these things.
Bull. I went and searched her lodgings directly after she was in custody; I took her to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             about seven in the evening; I searched the lodging that night.
Prisoner. It was a week after she charged me that he searched the bed.
Q. to Mrs. Talboys. When did you charge her with having the things?
Talboys. I told her I had lost so and so; I never charged her with any thing; that was on the 17th day of the month; it was the 25th when I searched the bed.

Q. Did she offer you to search directly?
Talboys. No, it was the constable thought of searching the bed.
Q. Did she offer you to search?
Talboys. No; she said it was very odd that she should be accused; that I might ask Alderman Thomas and Alderman Turner concerning her character, for she was a widow lady, and they had the management of her property.
Prosecutrix. The lock of the drawer where the caps and petticoats were taken out was broke, the rest of the locks were unlocked and all locked again.

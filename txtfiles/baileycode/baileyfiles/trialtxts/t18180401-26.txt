. On the 19th of March, about eleven o'clock in the day, I was by the New Church, in the Strand


, and felt my pocket move, I turned round, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand - I seized him, took it from him, and charged him with picking my pocket; he said poverty had induced him to do it.

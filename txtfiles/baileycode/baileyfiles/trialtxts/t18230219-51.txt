. On the 25th January, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop together - no other customers were there; I was the only person serving. They bought some Irish and flannel, and a blanket which were to be put up for them. I knew Sullivan before, but not Dowling - she came to recommend Dowling, who bought the goods. They were half an hour in the shop; there were other goods on the counter. I missed nothing, but the officer came in in about twenty minutes, while I was putting away the blankets, which I had shewn them. I accompanied him to the office without looking if anything was gone, and found the prisoners there in custody. I saw the articles there in a basket. I found three hearth rugs in one basket, and some flannel in the other - they were my master's property. I returned to the shop, and missed them; they had laid at the side of the shop, about two yards from the counter, against the wainscoat. Dowling sat on a stool close to the counter, and Sullivan stood at her side, and each had a basket - Dowling had a cloak on, and I think Sullivan a coat. I went behind a partition at the back of the shop for ten minutes, for the blankets, and I could not then see into the front.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is your master's name 
               
                  William 
                  John
               



             or 
               
                  John 
                  William
               



             - A. I do not know which is the first name. Sullivan has five children, and bore an excellent character. Dowling gave her name and address. The goods were to be paid for by weekly instalments.
COURT. Q. Is there any other 
               
                  William 
                  John
               



             or

                  William
               



             in the house. - A. No; my master has no children.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 25th of January, I was on duty at Charing-cross; with Ball, and saw the two prisoners coming towards the Horse Gaurds, in a direction from Cockspur-street. As we passed them Dowling slipped down by accident, and I saw this roll of flannel under her cloak, with the shop ticket on it - Sullivan lifted her up; they walked on about twenty yards together, and Dowling staggered in the road - Ball caught hold of her arm, and brought her on the pavement - Sullivan had then left Dowling, and was crossing the road; I fetched her back to where Dowling stood, and as I took the flannel from under Dowling's arm, two had shillings fell out of her hand, as she was trying to snatch the ticket off the flannel - she shut her hand again; I forced it open, and took three bad shillings from it, tied in a piece of rag. I gave her to Ball, and took Sullivan into custody; I found two hearth rugs, and a bill of the prosecutor's, and 20 s. in silver in her basket.
Cross-examined. Q. Sullivan had the basket - A. Yes. Ball took another basket from Dowling.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BALL
               



            . I found a rug in Dowling's basket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Sullivan put in a written Defence, stating that Dowling had desired her to accompany her to the shop, to be answerable for the goods, and upon coming out of the shop she put the stolen property in her basket.

            . On Sunday the 12th of November, between six and seven o'clock at night, I was going up Grace-church-street


, I felt something at my pocket, I turned instantly round, and laid hold of the prisoner, and saw the glimpse of my handkerchief fall from his right hand. It was a red-and-white linen one. I took it up from the ground; it lay about half a yard from his feet. He asked me what I laid hold of him for? I told him, his conscience would tell him. Some other lads, that I supposed to be his confederates, jostled my shoulder, at the instant that I felt the attack at my pocket; they were impertinent, and asked me what business I had with the boy? which rather determined me to prosecute him, or I know not but I should have let him have gone. The prisoner said, indeed he did not take it, and went on his knees once or twice, and desired to be let go. I took him to the Poultry-compter (after that he broke out of the compter ) I thinking I should never hear any more of him, used the handkerchief in common. And about a fortnight ago, coming over London-bridge, I had it picked out of my pocket, so cannot produce it. I had produced it before my Lord Mayor, and before the grand jury, when they found the bill.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

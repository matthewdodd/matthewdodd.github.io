MARY ANN PARROTT
. I am the wife of John Henry Parrott, of Mount-street, Bethnal Green—he is a dealer in coke. My husband found the prisoner without father or mother, and brought him home, and told me to fill his belly—that was on the Monday before the 4th of March—he went with

my husband to tell a little coke—on the Saturday between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I left him to clean my knives, while I went up stairs—when I came down, he was gone—I then missed a money-potcontaining three half-crowns, and six shillings—he had left a sixpence, which I had given him, in a drawer.





RICHARD COOPER
 (police-constable H 85.) I saw the prisoner in Essex-street, the same evening about half-past eight o'clock—he was running past me—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—he ran down Martin's-court—I caught him, and asked him what he had done with the money—he said he had hid it against a step of a door—I got a light, and found sixpence—he said he had taken one shilling, but he knew nothing of the money-pot—on the Monday, he said he would not mind taking six months, and say no more about it.




GUILTY
.†Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am the wife of Charles Jones - we live in Little Union-street, St. George's, East


. I let a furnished room to the prisoner at 5s. a week - she had not completed her week; I went out to work on the 2d of February, and came home about half-past eight o'clock at night - she was gone, and I missed this property; she never returned to pay the rent; I am quite sure of her person - I do not know how she gets her living.
Prisoner. She was perfectly aware that I pawned the things, and I gave her part of the money. Witness. I knew nothing about her pawning the things, and never gave her leave to do it; she had been in the house with a lodger of mine, for a few weeks before she lived with me.

Prisoner's Defence. I gave her part of the money towards the rent - another person took the room besides me; I had left the room, but the other person was there.

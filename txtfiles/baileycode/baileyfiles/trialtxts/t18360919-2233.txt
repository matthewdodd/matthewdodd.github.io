JAMES HOWARD
. I live in East-street Lambeth, and keep a shoemaker's stall in St. George's-road. About three o'clock on the 10th of September, I went to my stall after dinner—my window was safe when I went away—when I came back a pane of glass was cut out—I had left all these tools safe when I went away—they were gone when I came back, and the prisoners were at the window—I found these tools on White.





EDWARD LAWRENCE
 (Police-constable L 182.) About three o'clock on that afternoon I took the prisoners into custody—I searched them, and found these two articles on White, and these two awls on Isaacs—these other five articles were given me by the prosecutor, which he took from one of their pockets.

Guilty.

(The indictment also charged that both the prisoners had been previously convicted.)





WILLIAM ALDERMAN
. I got this certificate of the prisoners' former conviction from the Clerk of the Peace for Survey—(read)—the prisoners are the persons who were convicted.

ISAACS—

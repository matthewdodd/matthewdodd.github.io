Prisoner. I said I got it from a man of the name of Simms, who asked me to go with it to Shoe-lane, Holborn—I was going by Ball's-pond with my knott—a man called me, and said, "Master, do you want a job?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "If you take this, I will give you a half crown"—he helped me up and I was going—I met the policeman, who stopped me. Witness. I took his shoes off, and they corresponded with the marks in the soot at the house—I have been to Ball's-pond, and cannot find a man of the name of Simms there.

            . I am a raker
. I lost three iron hoops out of my yard, in Tottenham-court-road


, on the 20th of December. The prisoner applied to me for work. I told him I had hands enough, but as he was out of work I would employ him, which I did. While I was at dinner my daughter came in and told me that a man was gone out of the yard with some iron hoops; I overtook him with the hoops upon him. I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said that as he had stole them he was going to sell them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I wanted to line a hodd, as I was to go to work the next day as a bricklayer's labourer
, and I wanted a piece of old iron.

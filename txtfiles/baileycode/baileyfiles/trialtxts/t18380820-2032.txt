 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
4th of August, 1 ass, price 22s.; 1 set of harness, value 14s.; and 1 cart, value 1l.; the goods of 



John Jones.






JOHN JONES
. On the 4th of August I went with my cart, ass, and harness to Covent-garden-market-about six o'clock in the morning, I left the ass and cart with a boy, and was gone about an hour and a half-when I returned they were gone—I found the ass at Smithfield afterwards, and the cart in Chigwell-row.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon after you lost the donkey did you see it again? A. On the 10th of August-and the cart on the 15th.





JOSEPH OSBORNE
. I live at the Durham Arms, Hackney-road, and am a jobber. I saw James Taylor buy the donkey and harness of the prisoner on the 8th of August.





JAMES TAYLOR
. I bought the donkey and harness of the prisoner.





JOHN MANNOCK
. I live at Chigwell-row. I bought the cart of the prisoner at Romford-market, on the 8th of August.





ROBERT HORNSBY
 (police-constable F 83.) I took the prisoner in Seven-dials. I asked him if he was at Romford on Wednesday last—he said, "I have been at home all the week."
(-Tanfield, a milkman, and Margaret Donovan, gave the prisoner a good character.)

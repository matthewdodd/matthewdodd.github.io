 for stealing, on the 
3rd of October, 1 pair of boots, value 1✗; 1 coat, value 7s.; and 1 pair of trowsers, value 3s.; the goods of

WILLIAM WEBB
. I keep the Roebuck, in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner was my pot-boy. On the 15th of October, I asked him to produce a duplicate, if he had pawned any thing that morning—he said he had not one, and was very insolent—I took him up stairs, and put my hand into his pocket, and took out a bladder, which was wet with spirits, and a number of duplicates—I took him to a pawnbroker's, where I heard he had been seen to come out of—I then said to him," Among these duplicates there is not one of this day"—he then produced some others from his fob—I found there this pair of boots, and this coat, and trowsers which are mine—he said, "They are yours"—I have lost more than twenty pounds worth of things—the bladder was quite wet with spirits—it would contain between two and three quarts.





ROBERT GILES
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce these articles, which were pawned by the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me the trowsers—the coat, and the boots, I pawned, intending to get them out with my wages.

            , a boot and shoemaker
, in Tottenham-court-road


. On the 27th of September I was at home, and saw the prisoner come in about half-past five o'clock - he took the boots, put them under his coat, and walked off; he had got near a quarter of a mile before he was taken with them - these are the boots - they are my master's.
Prisoner's Defence. I was standing opposite a cheesemonger's window, and saw two young men standing at the prosecutor's; I went and looked at them - they said,"Don't say any thing, we will give you a pair if we can;" they threw me a pair, and I caught them - I then turned the corner, and ran away.

            . My husband's name is George, he is porter to a warehouse
; when I was on the bed I saw the prisoner in my room; I asked who was there, she made me no answer; I got out of bed and called to a woman, a lodger, and desired her to go and see what woman that was, for she had got some things of mine; she went after her, and the prisoner was brought back with a coat, a pair of breeches, and a gown (our property) in her lap; she laid them down in the passage, and desired I would forgive her; I desired her to go up stairs, to see if she had any thing more; I went up and did not miss any thing; (the goods produced in court, and depos'd to.)

            . I was at breakfast, and Mrs. Wright called to me, and I went after the prisoner and brought her back; and she laid the things down in the entry, and down on her knees, and asked my Mrs. Pardon.

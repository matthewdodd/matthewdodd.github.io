PHILIP LAWTON. I am nephew to Mr. Philip Lawton, a pawnbroker
, who lives in Green-street, Leicester-square


. On the 18th of November I was at dinner, I was called into the shop by the shopman. I saw two persons with him, and he told me to run after the prisoner, who had taken the trousers and waistcoat from the iron rod - I pursued the prisoner. I first took another person - then I took him, and found the trousers and waistcoat under his coat - they are new, and had been hanging on the rod outside the door. I had put them out myself about eight o'clock that morning - he told the Magistrate he had picked them up - but a gentleman who was there, said he had seen him take them off the rod - here they are.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I found them in the passage, which is a thoroughfare. Witness. I found him in Orange-court, about one hundred yards from our house. I think he had been down the court, and was coming up again, as he saw I had got the wrong man.

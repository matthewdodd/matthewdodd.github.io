            . I am a dancing-master
, and live at Somers'-town


 - the prisoner was my servant
. On the 21st of April, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, a lodger knocked at my door, and said my servant had gone out and robbed me; I went down, and found the prisoner in custody of an officer; there was a bundle in the passage, and these articles laid beside it - I lost no money, that is a mistake in the indictment; she had been with me nine days.

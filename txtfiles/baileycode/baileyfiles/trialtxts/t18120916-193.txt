            . I stopped the prisoner near Bridewell. He had a bag. I asked him, what was in it; he said, tools; he was a carpenter. I asked him, who he worked for. He did not know his master's name, nor the foreman.
MR. FRANELIN. These tools were brought to my house by the carpenters.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.

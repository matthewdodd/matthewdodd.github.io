            . I am a patrol. On Saturday, the 16th of November, about seven o'clock I stopped the prisoner in the Commercial Road, he was resting this lead in a bag, I asked him what he had got in the bag, he said he had got a bit of stuff, I said, what is it, he said, it is a hit of lead, I asked him where he got it from, he said he found it in a hole near the first rope ground in the Commercial Road; I asked him what he was, he said he was a journeyman carpenter. I secured him and the lead.

            . I am a plumber, I know thelead to be the lead that I laid on Mr. Myers's building.
Q. Where is the house that this was taken off. - A. In the parish of Limehouse


, about a quarter of a mile from where this was found, this lead was affixed to Mr. Myers's rope building, I am sure it was there a few days before, I can positively swear that it was affixed to Mr. Myers's building by the peculiar manner of laying the lead. I put it on the building.
Prisoner's Defence. I was in Stepney-fields, in the foot-path, I crossed to make water against the rope-field, in a hole I saw this lead, I took it up, and was bringing it along, the officer stopped me; there was nobody with me.

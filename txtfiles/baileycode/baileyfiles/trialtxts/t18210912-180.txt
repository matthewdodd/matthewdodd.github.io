            , a merchant
, of Montague-street, Russell-square


. On the 8th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was at breakfast, the cook came down from the dining-room, and said I had not put the heater in the fire; I went into the pantry and saw the prisoner put his hand through the iron bar, the window was open, and take the toast rack - he had come down the area steps. I ran after him - he threw it down in Montague-street - I caught him in Bury-street, and gave him in charge - I never lost sight of him.

            . On the 4th of September, about half past ten o'clock at night; I was at Bartholomew fair


, there was a rush made behind me, and I felt the prisoner's hand in my breeches pocket; I turned round and felt him moving my purse towards his left; I caught hold of his hand while I kept calling for assistance; we forced him on to Giltspur-street, where Harrison met us and took him, and on his person was found my purse, containing two guineas, two half crowns, and two sixpences.

SAMUEL FAWCETT
. I live in Worship-street, Shoreditch, and am a printer—on the 14th of June I missed a composing-stick—it was produced to me again in about a fortnight—I knew it again immediately—the prisoner had called at my place about posting-bills a day or two before—I think he is the man—this is my stick.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You will not sweat positively to the person of the prisoner? A. No—I had bail this stick fifteen years at least—they are used in the, trade generally—I know it by this crack on the back of it, and by this screw.





JOHN CHURCHILL
. I took the prisoner on the 13th of June, and found this stick in his coat-pocket.




GUILTY

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; I went out to see my husband, who is a soldier
, about six o'clock on the 11th of March: I returned about twelve o'clock, and found my door broke open; my room is up one pair of stairs, and the prisoner lodged in the room over mine; she left her lodgings, and did not return for above a week, when she told me she had pawned my gown at Mr. Hill's.

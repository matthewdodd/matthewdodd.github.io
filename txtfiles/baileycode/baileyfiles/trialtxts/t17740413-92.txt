            . I am a watchman; on the 11th of April between two and three in the morning I found the prisoner in Mr. Wood's compting-house; I secured him and found the things mentioned in the indictment upon him. ( They were produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.

It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner coming into the Prosecutor's House to drink a Gill of Wine, and being in the Kitchin, took the Spoon, and went away with it; but it being presently miss'd, he was pursued, and taken with the Spoon in his Pocket. The Fact being plainly proved, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

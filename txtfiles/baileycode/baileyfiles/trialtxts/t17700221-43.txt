            . I am a wheelwright
, and live at Hesson


. Last Friday morning I found my shop had been broke, and I missed the things laid in the indictment. I had a suspicion of the prisoner, he having before borrowed some of these tools of me. He is a carpenter
. I went to his house at Harlington, and there I found some of them in his work-shop, and some he owned he had buried under ground, and he himself dug them up. ( Produced in court, and deposed to.)

            , journeyman to the prosecutor, who was at the finding the tools again, deposed the same as the prosecutor.

I got up in the morning, and saw the tools lying in a back-house of mine that was open. I took some of them into the shop, and some I covered with a little ground.

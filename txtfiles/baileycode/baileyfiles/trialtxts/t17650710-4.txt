            . On the 27th of last month, between the hours of one and two in the day, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, out of my house; the hat was found pawned with Mr. Stockdale, in Poultney-street, on the 28th, (produced and deposed to): they had not been gone above five minutes before I miss'd them.

I was going into the fields to have a game at cricket; I stop'd to make water; I saw this hat tuck'd into a place; I took it and carried it to this young man.

            . The prisoner was in my employment on the 29th of September. On that day he was out, and a person called for him. I asked the boy what he wanted, he said the prisoner owed him one and sixpence; I asked him what for? he said for carrying a box, to the Bolt in Tun Inn, in Fleet street. I remarked that a shilling might have been enough for that. I got this box, from the Bolt in Tun, and found it contained a cream ewer, and a silver mug, and other articles of my property. The box itself was mine.

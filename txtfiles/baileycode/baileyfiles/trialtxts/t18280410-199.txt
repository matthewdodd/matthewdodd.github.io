            , I live at Fulham. On the 12th of March Mason came and asked if I dealt in old rags - I said Yes; he then said it was not rags, but a counterpane, and gave it up to me in my cart; I said I did not want anything of that kind; it was in a blue handkerchief, and I took it down to Bolton's, who said he would give 4s. for it, if the man came honestly by it - Mason had asked me 5s. for it; Bolton gave me 4s., and I gave it to Mason - I did not know I was doing wrong.

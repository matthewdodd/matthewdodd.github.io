HENRY PREECE
. I live in Devonshire-square, Portraan-place. On the 31st of May, I was in High-street, St. Giles—a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and said something—I turned and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—this is it—I took him—a gentleman went and got an officer—I charged the prisoner with stealing it—he went down on his knees, and said he would not do such a thing again—I am sure I had not dropped it.

Prisoner, I was four yards before the gentleman, and a boy came running past me who dropped the handkerchief—the person who told the prosecutor of it took the handkerchief off the ground—he never saw it in my hand, and the policeman said it was not worth while to take me—then the prosecutor said he did see it in my hand, and he has stuck out ever since that he did. Witness. I never heard the officer say any thing of the kind—I am quite sure I saw it in his hand.





JAMES HALE
 (police-constable F 100.) I was on duty, and saw the prosecutor with the prisoner in custody, and the handkerchief which he said he saw in the prisoner's hand—I never said it was not worth while to take him.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

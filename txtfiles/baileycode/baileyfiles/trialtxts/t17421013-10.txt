            . I told her if she would give me the Necklace, I would let her go; she threw part of it down on the Floor. I asked her for the Locket, which was of the greatest Value; she said it was down the Child's Back. But when I sent for the Child to search her, it was not about her; and then she gave the Locket to me. The Child was but just come from School, and I saw the Necklace upon her Neck.

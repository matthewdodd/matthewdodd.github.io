                  , 3 l. 5 s. 6 d. in Money
            , on the 3rd of February
 last. John Barter depos'd, that between 10 and 11 at night he met the prisoners, who overpersuaded him to go with them to a Brandy shop in St. Andrews-street


: Harrison call'd for Geneva and grew very familiar with his Breeches: that he felt her hand in his Pocket which he pull'd out, and putting his own hand and feeling some money, did not think she had rob'd him; but when he came home missing the sum in the Indictment, he found out the prisoners, and committed them to the Round-house. Harrison said, if he had lost so much Money, some of it must be dropt, for it was more than she took. Harrison in her defence said, that the Prosecutor call'd for a quartern of Geneva, for which he gave a Shilling to change, and gave her 8 d. he had out of it; he then beckon'd her to the door, and ask'd her to go and lie with him for that 8 d. but she refusing, he swore he'd be reveng'd of her, and fetch'd a Constable, Being askt if she could call any body to her reputation; yes, says she, here's this Gentlewoman (pointing to her fellow prisoner) knows me to be very honest, Harrison was found 


               Guilty to the value of 10d.
             but the Evidence not reaching Watkins, she was 

               acquitted
            .

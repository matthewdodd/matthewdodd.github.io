WILLIAM CRAGHILL
. I live at Hemingford-terrace—I keep the house—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On Sunday evening, the 21st of Feb., I went out to church with my wife—I left nobody in the house—I left it quite secure, and double-locked the door—I am certain of that—I returned about half-past eight o'clock, and found the door on the single lock—on entering I found everything deranged, and the parlour and bed-room drawers all turned inside out—I missed the articles named in the indictment, and found them at the police-station—I have seen them since—they belong to me and my wife.





PAUL PRITCHARD
 (police-constable N 237.) On the 21st of Feb., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in the Caledonian-road, about three quarters of a mile from Mr. Craghill's, and going from there—he had this bundle on his head—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, "A coat and waistcoat"—I asked how he came by them—he said he had them from his mother—I asked where she lived—he said he could not tell me the name of the street—I asked him to show me—he said he could not—I found all these things in the bundle, except three handkerchiefs and a watch, which were in his pocket, with a box of lucifer matches.




GUILTY
of stealing only.
 Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Lord Chief Baron Pollock.

            . On the 17th of last month, coming along Prince's street


 about nine o'clock at night he threw me down, and put his hand to my throat, and almost stop'd my breath, he cut my pocket and took what money I had got, and my cloak and two handkerchiefs, which were about my neck, and another cotton one, and several other things I had about me, and told me he would put his hand between my ribs if I spoke a word; the next morning I saw him in a gin shop, and seeing my two handkerchiefs about his neck, I took hold of him with my hands; sirrah, said I, it is hard you should have my two handkerchiefs, and I have nothing to put on to keep me from the cold, but he abus'd me very much. Another witness that is here came by, I told him what I had lost, he was search'd, and these other things were found upon him, and he deliver'd me the two handkerchiefs himself.
Q. Where was you coming from at this time?

            . I had been abroad several years, I had travel'd from Naples on foot by Rome, through Italy to Paris, and from thence to Kent in this kingdom, and had earned a little money there in gathering of hope, which I had in my pocket, and the prisoner took from me.

            . On the 18th of September I was going about my business crying old cloaths, I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling for these two handkerchiefs: I ask'd her what was the matter; she said she had been robb'd the night before. When the handkerchiefs were taken from him I ask'd if he had any other things; in searching him I found a pair of spectacles, a knife, a wooden spoon, and a tin pot; he said he brought the handkerchiefs at the sign of the Greyhound, but did not mention the street; so I and two other man brought him to the Round house.
Mr. Humes. Coming near my own house, seeing a struggle between the woman and the prisoner I heard the woman mention every thing before they were found upon the prisoner; and after, I saw the tin pot, spectacles, and wooden spoon taken from him.

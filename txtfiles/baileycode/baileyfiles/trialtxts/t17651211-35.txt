            . On Monday the 18th of November I was in Leadenhall-street


, a little distance from where the fire was. I perceived a man's hand in my pocket; I turned immediately, and saw no person near me but the prisoner: I charged him with having taken my handkerchief upon missing it; he immediately threw it to me, and I catched it in my hands.
Q. Did you see where he took it from?
Cooke. I think he took it from his bosom. He ran away, I called out stop thief; a man tripped up his heels; he was never out of my sight till taken. I got a constable and charged him; he was taken to the Compter, and next day before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall. I there produced the handkerchief: he there said he took it off the ground. It appeared clean; and had it been on the ground it must have been very dirty at that time. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I picked up the handkerchief. A man passed by me, I did not know him; he went up by the market. The gentleman turned about, and asked me if it was his handkerchief: I said if it was, he might have it. I gave it him, and he gave charge of me directly. If it had been a handkerchief of gold, I should never have attempted to steal it.

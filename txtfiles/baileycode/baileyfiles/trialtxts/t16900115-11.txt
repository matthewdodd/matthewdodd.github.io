             and 
               
                  
                     Samuel 
                     Eades
                  



               
             of St. Andrew's Holbourn



, were Indicted, Taylor as principal, Eades as Accessary, for 


               stealing one Silver Tankard value 6 l.
             on the 25th of December
 last, the Goods of 
               
                  John 
                  Stanton
               




            : Taylor would not plead at first, until Eades was cleared, and being ask'd several times to plead, they both refused it; but having a little respite, and the Court telling them the danger of standing mute, viz. That they should be immediately Pressed, &c. at last they both pleaded Not Guilty; and upon the Tryal it appeared, that the Tankard was found in Mr. Whitwood's House with the two Prisoners, and that the Prisoner Taylor was at Mr. Stauton's House, and took away the Tankard in his Breeches; all which he confest upon his Apprehension, but denied all upon his Tryal, so also did Eades; but Eades was found to have received the Tankard of Taylor after he had stole it, he being Whitwood's Man, so Taylor was found 

               Guilty
             as Principal, and Eades as Accessary.

            . On the 19th of October, about half past twelve o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Cleveland-street and Rowland-street, Fitzroy-square


; a girl of the town accosted me, and asked me how I did! I said pretty well, and I were about leaving her, when twelve or fourteen young men came down Russel-place and surrounded us. The prisoners and two others attacked me, and immediately my watch was snatched from my fob; but I caught it in my right hand; and collared the third man. They bit me a violent blow on the face, and after that, they dispersed. The two prisoners were afterwards apprehended according to the description I gave. I could swear to their persons. I took Taylor myself, and delivered him to the hands of the watchman. I saw the other secured about ten minutes afterwards. The watchman took him.

 was indicted

GEORGE POPE
. I am a solicitor, and live in Gray's-inn-square. On the night of the 12th of September, I was in Holborn, about half-past ten o'clock—I felt somebody put a hand to my pocket—I immediately turned round and saw the prisoner and another person with him—I endeavoured to lay hold of them—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him, and in crossing Castle-street I saw him let my handkerchief fall—I kept him in sight till the watchman took hold of him—this is my handkerchief (looking at it.)

Prisoner, I am innocent of it—I never saw the prosecutor or his hand kerchief—I told the officer I was not the person—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," I turned round, and the prosecutor was forty yards from me. Witness. I am certain he is the man who dropped my handkerchief—it was in my coat pocket.





THOMAS LONG
. I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner on the night of the 12th of September, running down Castle-street, and the prosecutor after him, crying "Stop thief!"—I secured the prisoner, and took him to the watch house: the prosecutor gave me the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. The officer swears falsely against me—I saw somebody

run by me, and hearing a cry of "Stop thief," I ran—the patrol saw me running, and secured me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

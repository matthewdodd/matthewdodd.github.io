            . The Prisoner was my Fellow-Servant
 at Mr. Blandy's, a Tobacconist, on Breadstreet-hill


; I had leave to go out on Friday Afternoon, and when I return'd in the Evening my Mistress was gone to Epsom. Next Morning I miss'd my Headcloaths out of my Box; I suspected the Prisoner, and I took her before Alderman Brocas; she deny'd it at first, but as she was going to the Compter, she pull'd the Headcloaths out of her Pocket, and put them into my Hand. 


               Guilty 10 d.

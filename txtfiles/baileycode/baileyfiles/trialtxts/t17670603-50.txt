            . On Tuesday the 12th of May, between nine and ten, the prisoner was sitting drinking by me in my master's house, the Castle in Kingsland-road


, where I am ostler
; I fell asleep; when I awaked, I missed my canvas bag with a guinea and a half and a key in it, out of my left-hand breeches pocket; the prisoner then was gone; I had a suspicion he had it; I got a warrant, the constable took him, he can give an account of what passed afterwards; I have known the prisoner some years, I never heard any harm of him before.

            . I am headborough. On Saturday the 16th of May, the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of a guinea and a half, a purse and key; he brought a warrant; I was in at the Bull alehouse; the prisoner, two men, and a woman came in, they are are all milk people; I told the prisoner I had a warrant against him; one of the men said, blast my eyes if it is not the ostler at the Castle; the prisoner immediately said, if it is I will give him his money, and said he had done the thing, and was sorry for it; he said he had spent the half guinea and changed the guinea; he gave me back a half guinea, a quarter guinea, three shillings, and two sixpences, which he owned were part of the money he had taken from Parks; he bid me tell him, he had flung the key of his box down his master's cellar window.
Prosecutor. I went into my master's cellar, and there found my key.
Prisoner's defence.
I went into the public-house after nine o'clock; I sat and had three pints of beer, the young man was asleep; there was another ostler sat on his left side, my wife and I sat together; I came out at eleven; when at the door, I kicked something; I took it up, it was a purse, and this money in it; I took the money out, and flung the purse and key away.

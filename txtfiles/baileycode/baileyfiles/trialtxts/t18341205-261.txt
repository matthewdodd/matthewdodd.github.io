THOMAS HEMINGWAY
. I live with my father, in Cross-street, Back-lane, and am a shoemaker. About a quarter past nine o'clock, on the 4th of December, I saw the prisoner—I knew him, and watched him—he was by Mr. Boyd's shop—I saw him take a piece of bacon off the board inside the window—I told the officer.





ROBERT BOYD
. This is my bacon—I was in the shop, but did not see it taken—I missed it immediately—I have a partner.





JOHN NICHOLSON
 (police-constable K 18.) I was called—I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop—I took him, and he dropped this bacon.

Prisoner. I did not take it—I had some tea and sugar in my apron. Witness. He had two small parcels beside the bacon.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work all day for my father, and he sent me for tea-and sugar, and other things—I went into this man's shop for some butter—I touched this bacon, and it fell down.





THOMAS HEMINGWAY
. I saw him take it, and put it in his apron.
(Sarah Riches gave the prisoner a good character.

            . I am servant to Mr. Marshall: the prisoner was in the tap room between five and six o'clock; he had a pint of beer in a silver pint mug; I saw it when I received the reckoning of him; I missed it as soon as he was gone; there were no more than two other gentlemen in the room, but they sat at a considerable distance. Last Friday the prisoner was brought to my master's house; I heard him say he had sold it for meer want.
Marshall again. I was informed on my return home that the prisoner had stole my mug; I told the story to a person who said he knew him, and he brought him on Friday; being taxed with stealing it, he said he had sold it in Oxford-road for 3 l. we went together there, and there the mug was found.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am a very unfortunate man: I had a genteel fortune when I came of age, but by my bad economy have squandered it away: my brother lives at the corner of Hatton Garden, a man of character and fortune, and I have two sisters in town married and settled, all of exceeding good characters. Till this unfortunate affair happened my character was unimpeached. I was brought up to a genteel business.

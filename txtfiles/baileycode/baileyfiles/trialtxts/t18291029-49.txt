            . I am in the service of Mr. William Taylor, haberdasher
, of Lamb's Conduit-street


. I saw the prisoner take this roll of flannel from the shop, between two and three o'clock, on the 9th of October - he ran away, and I followed him; he dropped it, and I took it up - he was brought back in a few minutes; I lost sight of him, but had seen him sufficiently to know he was the man.
Prisoner. Q.Did not a gentleman come in and say I was not the person? A. No, a person came in and attempted to interfere, but the officer would not let him stop.

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner in the shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going home to dinner in Ormond-street, and saw a person running with a roll of flannel under his arm; there was a cry of "Stop thief! he dropped the flannel in a door-way, and turned down a street before I got to the place - some persons came down Chapel-street, and took me; I said I was not the person, and I would go to the shop and prove it - a person went to prove it, and said he saw another person run with it.

            . Q.Did the person who said the prisoner was not the person appear respectable? A. I should think not.

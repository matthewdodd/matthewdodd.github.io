JOHN HANCOCK
 was indicted

John Carter, in his dwelling-house.






ANN CARTER
. I am the wife of John Carter, and live in Hackney-road, in the parish of Bethnal-green. On the 19th of June, about 11 o'clock a night I was in the back parlour and heard somebody come into the shop—I got up and saw it was the prisoner—he took the clock off the counter and ran off with it—my husband immediately pursued him, and I followed—I found the clock in the street, between our house and the next—I think I have seen the prisoner in the shop before.





JOHN CARTER
. My wife alarmed me—I ran out and found the prisoner about three yards from the house—he threw the clock down on the pavement and ran about fifty yards. I called "Stop thief," and the policeman stopped him—he was never out of my sight—this is the clock—(looking at it)—it is worth 15l.—it is my dwelling-house.





JOHN JOHNSON
. I am a policeman. I stopped the prisoner and have produced the clock.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

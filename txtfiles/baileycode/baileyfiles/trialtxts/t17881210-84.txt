                   HARRISON
               



             sworn.
I am clerk to Mr. 
               
                  Timothy
                   Fisher
               



            , at Holborn-Bridge


, I know the two prisoners; on the 28th of October last, at the closing of the day, near upon four, they came into our shop, and asked to look at some prints; I shewed them some, which they did not want; I had two other customers with me, I attended them also between whiles, when I gave the prisoners a second description of pieces to look at, which they had wished for, and amongst which there was a print which I shall afterwards describe; they did not seem satisfied, and immediately went to the door without buying any thing, and so hastily, that I followed them, to prevail on them to return; but they immediately went off; I did not observe them take any thing.
Who was in the shop besides yourself, of your own people? - There was another shopman on the other side, and Mr. Fisher was to and fro frequently, but I am not positive whether he was in the shop; in a little time after Mr. Bowerbank's man came in with a piece of print, which was my master's property, which I am sure was one of them that I put down before thesegood women, I went to Mr. Bowerbank's shop and saw the prisoner.

             sworn.
I saw this print taken from under the arm of one of the prisoners in Mr. Bowerbank's shop; she said she bought it below (pointing to Snow-hill); our shop is in Newgate-street, and afterwards she said she bought it at the West-end of the Town, and after being asked where, she said at a great distance; and refused to tell where.

             sworn.
I took this piece from under the left arm of the young prisoner, a cloak partly over it, only the end sticking out (this witness agreed with the last in the answer she gave of it). I sent my young man to Mr. Fisher's, and he returned with Mr. Fisher's man, and the old woman pretended to fall into a swoon, and the young one was begging of me to let them go; as soon as he came in he said, these are the women, and the old lady jumped up very quick, and said it was not me, it was her.
(The piece of callico produced and deposed to, by Harrison; the lowest value 20 s.)

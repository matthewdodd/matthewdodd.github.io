            . I am a painter, and live in Chapel-row, Clerkenwell. I heard a cry of Stop thief! on the 14th of September, about one hundred yards from King's house; the prisoner passed me, with a bundle under his arm; I pursued, and saw him throw it away - I took it up and Abbinett stopped him, without my losing sight of him.

. About half-past eight o'clock in the evening I saw a man come into the shop, and take these prints, which hung about two yards from the door; he ran out - I followed, giving the alarm, and he was taken - this is the property - it is worth about two guineas.

            . I live at Winchmore-hill. The prisoner is a labouring man
, and lived within half a mile of me. I am a blacksmith. The prisoner brought this plough chain to me, and said he found it between London and Tottenham: On the Monday following I heard he was taken up about some horseshoes; then I gave an account of this chain. Mr. Jackson came and owned it. (Produced in court.)

. This is my plough chain; it was taken from the plough in the common field.

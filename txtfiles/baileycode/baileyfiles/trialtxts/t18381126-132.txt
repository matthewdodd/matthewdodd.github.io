RICHARD ROADKNIGHT
 (police constable T 120.) I was in Oxford-terrace a few minutes before five o'clock, on the 12th of November—the prisoner was carrying this bundle, in company with two more young thieves—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Two pairs of trowsers"—I took him, and found the owner.





JOHN BLENMAN
, I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Marchant, a pawn-broker and salesman, in Edgeware-road. I saw these trowsers safe inside the door at twenty minutes before five o'clock—they are my master's trowsers, and have the shop-mark on them—I know the prisoner about that place.

JOHN CRISPIN
. I live with my father, John Samuel Crispin, in Rufford's-buildings, Islington. On Friday, the 18th of May, he had a pair of shoes hanging outside the shop—they were safe about nine or ten o'clock in the morning—a little after eleven o'clock somebody gave me information—I ran out of the shop, and saw the prisoner running through the turnpike—I ran after him—he was going down White Lion-street—I lost sight of him—a gentleman told me to go to the other end of the street, and I did, and met the prisoner—I said, "Give me those shoes?"—he said, "I have not got them, it was a boy who ran up White Lion-street"—the prisoner was taken, and these shoes—(looking at them)—were found on him in my presence—they are my father's.





THOMAS HOBBS KING
 (police-serjeant N 22.) I took the prisoner, and found these shoes in his pocket.




GUILTY

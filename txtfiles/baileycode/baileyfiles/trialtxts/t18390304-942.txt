ALFRED PHILP
. I am a baker, and live at Harlington. I went out with bread on the 2nd of March, and left my barrow for about three minutes while I went into a customer's—when I came out I missed five two pound loaves and a sack—I saw the prisoners run away, and Gregory threw the sack and one loaf away—Collins was carrying some loaves in his smock-frock—he was taken two or three hours after—I had known him before.

Collins. I had no bread at all—I was not with this chap at all. Witness. Yes he was—he was not three yards from my barrow when I first saw him.





WILLIAM LAWRENCE
. I am a horse-patrol. On the 2nd of March I received information that Collins had stolen some bread—I galloped after him—he got into a shrubbery—I got off my horse, followed, and took him.





THOMAS BRAY
. I am an officer. About four o'clock that afternoon I saw Collins go down the Bath road—he turned to Feltham—I went, and assisted in taking him.

COLLINS—


GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

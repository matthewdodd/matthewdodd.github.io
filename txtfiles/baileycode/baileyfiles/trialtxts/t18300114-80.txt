ROBERT FOOT. I am a labourer
. I saw the prisoner on the 7th of December, in Drury-lane


, and went with her to a public-house, to give her a quartern of gin; I was not there long - I took off my hat to pay for the gin; I had my money in a pouch in my hat - I missed my money, and charged her with it; she denied it strongly - I went out, got a Police-constable, and he searched her - he found the pouch on her with some money in it, but not all; I think he found 3s. - I do not know what could have become of the rest of the money: she had not gone out.
WILLIAM SIMMONDS. I was sent for, and the prosecutor said he had lost 25s. - I found 3s. on the prisoner in the tobacco pouch, and 8 1/2d. in her neck.(Pouch produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had given her the money, and accused her of stealing it, because she would not accompany him to a house of ill-fame.

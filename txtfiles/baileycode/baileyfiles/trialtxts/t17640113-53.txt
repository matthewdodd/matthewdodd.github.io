            . I was in court last September Sessions, when 
               
                  John 
                  Medows 
               



             was tried here, for committing a rape on the body of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Heather 
               



            ; she was first sworn, after which she gave in evidence, that she lived servant with the said Medows a quarter of a year; that in that time he was very often misusing her, and trying her for her honesty, and one time almost stripped her naked; and, on the 2d of May, he did ravish her against her will, as she sat in a chair in the kitchen; and that she acquainted Mrs. Howard with it that very night; and that Mrs. Charters came three days after the rape was committed, and staid at her master's house a fortnight; that she told her what her master had done to her, and farther said, Mrs. Charters did not come there till the second day after.


                  John 
                  Meadows 
               



             deposed, he never did ravish her, or use her as she had before sworn on the former trial.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Howard 
               



             deposed, that 
               
                  Mary 
                  Heather 
               



             never did complain of any such usage from her master to her.


                  Margaret 
                  Charters 
               



             deposed, that she went to Mr. Meadows's house, the last day of last April, and staid there till the 17th of May, with her two children; that the prisoner was servant there then: that she never in that time made the least complaint in the world of Mr. Meadows's conduct towards her.
Prisoner's Defence.
There he stands, let him deny it if he can: he did ravish me on the 2d of May; every one of the neighbours can justify it.

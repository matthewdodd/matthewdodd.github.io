Q. Do you recollect going out on the 22nd of December - A. Yes; I locked my door and came home again. I met the prisoner as I came home on the stairs; the prisoner had my property in her apron; I could not tell what it was when I met her. I went up to my room door; it was unlocked, but shut to. Finding that, I pursued the prisoner; I over-took her; I saw her where she ran in; I followed in after her; I catched hold of her arms; I said she had been robbing me; she said, me robbing you; I said, yes. I saw in her apron four gowns, one petticoat, a yard and a half of gown new print, and two pockets; she had taken them out of a box in the room, but the box was not locked. These are the articles; they are mine. The four gowns are worth twenty-seven shillings.
ELIZABETH CARR. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix in Compton-street; I saw a bunch of keys drop from the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I was going up Compton-street when some man stopped me.

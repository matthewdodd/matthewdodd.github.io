            . The prisoner was a servant
 of mine. I missed some of these things whilst she was with me: but I did not miss the tablecloths until the 23rd of August, after she ran away; she went away on the 21st of August. She sent to my daughter to go and meet her, and my daughter brought her back to me. I asked her how she could think of serving me so, as there was a bill of her accumulating presented from the public-house; she said, she hoped she could make amends if I would take, her into my service again.

1708. 




JAMES ARTER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 milk-jug, value 1l.; and 9 spoons, 1l.; the goods of 



Richard Pittman; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HARRIET BELL.
 I am servant to Mr. Richard Pittman—he lives at No.6, Kennington-terrace, Kennington-lane. On the 1st of July, the prisoner came to the house, with a pretence to put a pane of glass in—I thought he had been sent for—I took him to the back bed-room on the first floor—there was a pane of glass broken there—he took a knife out of his pocket, and wanted to make it hot in the fire—I said, "Very well, go down into the kitchen"—he went—I looked in his basket, and did not see any glass—that made me suspect him—I went half-way down stairs after him, and I heard him taking the plate out of the kitchen closet—he then took his basket, and went out—I went and looked in the closet, and the plate was gone—I had seen it not more than ten minutes before—I went after the policeman—the policeman took him—this is my master's plate.





WILLIAM KING.
 I saw the prisoner running, and Bell after him—I saw the prisoner throw the basket over Mr. Westwood's wall—I ran, and took him—he begged me to let him go, or I should get him transported—he said I should have the plate.

Prisoner. This man would have taken the property away from me, if he could have got it where no one saw him.





CHARLES CLIFFORD
 (police-constable L 121.) I found the prisoner running—he had thrown the basket over the wall—the plate was in his pocket—this is it.





SAMUEL HAMPTON
 (police-sergeant D 24.) I produce a certificate of the Prisoner's former conviction at this court, by the name of John Young—(read—Convicted 30th Jan., 1843, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

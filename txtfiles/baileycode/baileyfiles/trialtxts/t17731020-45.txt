Second Count for stealing thirty-six mother o'pearl frames for hair pins, value 5 s. the property of the said 
               
                  Edward
                   Flowers
               



            , Sept. 28th. The other for 


               receiving the same goods, well knowing them to have been stolen
            .


                  Edward
                   Flowers
               



            . I live in the Liberty of the Rolls, Chichester Rents, Chancery-lane: I am a working jeweller
; Morris has worked for me six years. On the 28th of September 
               
                  Joseph
                   Loton
               



             informed me he saw him take away a dozen and a half of frames for hair pins and some drops. I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's and got a warrant; I took a constable to his apartment in Bell-yard; I accused him of taking away the frames; he said he did take them away, and that he had sold them to Mr. Hayward. Sir John granted me a warrant to bring him before him; I went but he was not at home; he lives in Burley-street in the Strand; he is a working jeweller and keeps a shop; I forgot to mention we found the drops upon Morris when we took him; the next morning we searched Hayward's house and found about thirty pins, that is to say frames fitted to pins. I lost the frames only; I know the frames were mine.
Q. How do you know the frames to be your's?
Flowers. I cannot describe how; we know our work by a great deal of practice in the business; they were made by 
               
                  William
                   Blakesley
               



            : the prisoner don't work this sort of work; the prisoner worked for me by the day; he had not implements to work at home; they cost a great deal of money; I am sure they were not worked by the prisoner.
Q. If Hayward furnished him with the mother o'pearl, was he able to make these things?
Flowers. Yes; if he had an engine to do it, but he had none.
Q. Then you are sure they are not his work?
Flowers. Yes; he said he was wickedly drawn into it by Hayward. When we took Hayward he said he had employed this man three years, that he gave him shelis to work, and money to buy shells; he said he gave him sometimes a shilling, sometimes eighteen-pence to buy them; it is impossible to buy mother o'pearl of this quality for eighteen-pence; he said before Sir John that was the most he ever gave him. On his cross examination, he said, a frame before it was worked up was worth two-pence; that he could not describe how he knew them to be his, nor could any one that had not served seven years apprenticeship to it, but that he knew his own work.


                  Joseph
                   Loton
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Flowers. On the 28th of September as I was at work near the prisoner. I saw him take some mother o'pearl frames out of a paper that lay by him, and put them in his waistcoat pocket; I was turning frames and he was making drops; the frames were laid there for the man at the next bench to him to pick a pair out of them; he was going to dinner; I did not say any thing to him; I was going to tell my master but was prevented. On the Thursday night I saw him polish some drops and put them in his pocket; I told my master of it that night; I went with my master and the constable to search Hayward's house, and the frames fitted to pins in his house. I have been apprentice to Flowers six years; I am used to turn and drill these frames.
Q. Look at the frames whose work are they?
Loton. William Blakesley's; I know the work of every man in the shop because they all come through my hands.
Q. How does Blakesley work?
Loton. I cannot describe it; they lie in a different form rather to another man's work. When we went into Mr. Hayward's house my master told him he had a warrant for him, and on what account; he denied knowing any thing of it; he said he had employed Morris, and had a man at work up stairs; we searched his house and found the frames and some drops; we went up stairs; there was no man at work, and the lairs proper for this work had not been used a great while; they were very dirty and rusty. On his cross examination he said the frames were quite plain when they came out of Blakesley's hands; that since that holes had been drilled in them, which makes them feel not quite so smooth.


                  William
                   Blakesley
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Flowers: I believe the frames of the pins to be my turning, I cannot be positive; I think the other witness can be more positive than I; he can tell my work as well as I can.
Morris's Defence.
This is the man (pointing to Hayward) that led me to this unhappy place.
Hayward's Defence.
Please your Lordship I never received any goods of this man in my life but what I thought was made out of my own shell.
For Hayward.


                  William
                   East
               



            . I am a jeweller: I live in Fleet-street; I know the prisoner, Morris, by the name of Eggleston; I have seen him shave shells to pieces at Mr. Hayward's, and take them home to work, and have seen him bring frames back, and put the wire or silver in the shop; they were the same sort as these, only larger.
Court. Did you ever hear Hayward give directions to make frames of the shells?
East. Yes.


                  David
                   Leroach
               



            . I live at Mr. Hayward's; Morris worked for him; I have seen him saw shells and put them in his pocket, and the next day bring back frames and drops and pins; he has drilled them in my presence.
Q. Did you ever see Morris turn the frames?
Leroach. No, only drill them after they came home.


                  John
                   Worrell
               



            . I am in the pearl work; I have made frames seven years: it is impossible for any man to swear to his work before it is mounted, there are so many work alike.


                  Phebe
                   Carrock
               



            . I am a pearl-stringer; I finish them; I have bought frames of Flowers after they have been drilled and worked them up for Hayward; it is customary to go and buy these kind of things when we have not time to work them up ourselves. It is impossible to know one man's work from another.

- Tomkinson. I am a jeweller: I have known Hayward nine years; I never heard his character impeached in any degree before; I have dealt with him considerably, and most of the shops in London I believe have. It is impossible for a man to swear to his work after it is drilled.


                  John
                   Parks
               



            . I keep a shop on Ludgate-hill: I have known Hayward five years; I have had considerable dealings with him three years. I really think it impossible for a man to swear to his property in such things as these. He was looked upon as a fair dealing man; I have trusted him with money without any security; I always found him exceeding honest; that is his general character.


                  Edward
                   Seales
               



            . I am a jeweller in the Strand: I have known Hayward about seven years; I found him always very just; I have dealt with him a good deal; I never heard his character impeached before this.

WILLIAM SMITH
 and 




ROBERT ATKINS
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
22nd of September, 3 brushes, value 9s., the goods of 



William Knight.






WILLIAM KNIGHT
. I am the son of William Knight, of Wilstead-street, Somerstown. I was in the shop on the 22nd of September—I hung these brushes up in the morning—I do not recollect when I saw them last, but I missed them in the evening, about a quarter to ten o'clock—I have never found them since.





CHARLES MARSH
. I live in the Hampstead-road. At a quarter to ten o'clock on this evening I was at the prosecutor's shop—I saw Smith take down three brushes from the door-post—I am sure he is the man—Atkins and another person were walking on the curb, near the door—after Smith took them Atkins joined him, and Smith gave him the brushes—they went some distance, and gave them to a third person, who went away with them—I followed, saw a policeman, and gave them in charge.





WILLIAM WILLARD
 (police-constable S 163.) I was on duty in Clarenden-square at a quarter to ten o'clock, and heard the cry of "Police"—

I came up—the two prisoners were given to me—they said they knew nothing about it.
(Smith received a good character.)

SMITH—


GUILTY
. Aged 21.—



Confined Three Months.

ATKINS**—


GUILTY

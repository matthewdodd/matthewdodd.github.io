 in Old-street, St. Luke's


. On the 18th of October, at twelve o'clock, the prisoner, who often used the house, came in to beg for some coffee; I said I could not afford to give him any - he asked leave to sit down; I said he might; he stopped till ten minutes past one, then asked for a pennyworth of coffee, which I gave him; I was in the parlour, where the watch was -I left the parlour for about two minutes, to call my husband to dinner; on my return the prisoner was gone, and I missed the watch; he was the only person in the shop.

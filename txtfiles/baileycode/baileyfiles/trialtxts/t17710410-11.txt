            . Yesterday I met this woman coming out of my shop with a bundle under her arm; I let her pass: afterwards I thought she might have something of mine. I followed her, and asked her what she wanted; she said she wanted a piece of cloth; I turned her cloak back, and saw a piece of my cotton, I know it by the pattern, it is my own pattern (produces it.) She begged I would not prosecute her. It was taken from a pile just within the door.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to buy a bit of cloth; nobody was there to answer me. I did take it to be sure.

            . I live in Red-lyon-street, Whitechapel


: On the 14th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was in my compting-house; a neighbour coming by, said, why don't you shut down your cellar window? My man and I went down the cellar stairs, and I saw six Gloucester cheeses lying on the window; I miss'd six more, and a firkin of butter, I cannot say who took them.

                  James 
                  Marshal 
               



             asked me one day if I would go with him a thieving, we lodge in Cable-street, I told him no; he went over to the sign of the India-arms, and got two pints of beer; I had a new pair of trowsers on, he said, if I would pull them off, and pawn them, he would fetch them out again in the morning. I did for a shilling, we went and spent it, and then went out; we went up into Red-lyon-street, and saw this cellar window open; he asked me to go down, I told him I would not; as I was by the window he shov'd me down, then he bid me hand him up the first thing I could get. I handed him up a firkin of butter, he carried it home, and came again and took six cheeses; at that time I laid six cheeses on the window ready for us next time. We went home, then he asked me to come again, I told him I would not; he said, if I would not he would go and tell the man. Then I went again the third time, when I was got down in the cellar a gentleman came by, and said, the window was open, so I got up and run away; then we went home and staid all night.
Prosecutor. He charg'd Howard, saying, he would go with them the second time to help them with the cheeses, before the Justice.

            . I was drunk then, and did not know what I said. I don't know Howard, only by seeing him go up and down Cable-street, where he lived.
Prosecutor. He was not drunk: Then he gave his information against both the prisoners in writing, the Justice's clerk took it.
Marshal. I was along with that boy, meaning

            , all the evening; he asked me, and I went with him, and had a firkin of butter and two cheeses; Howard was the same time at an alehouse over the way.

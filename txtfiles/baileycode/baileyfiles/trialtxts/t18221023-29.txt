            . I am shopman to 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Morris
               



            , a linen draper
, of Fleet-market


, in the parish of St. Bride. On the 8th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop alone, and asked to see some shawls. I shewed her twenty or thirty, but she bought none. I left seven on the counter - she stood looking at them while I went to the other end of the shop, and on returning I found there was only six. Nobody else was at the counter. I was absent about a minute. On my return, she said she would mention the price to a person, and would call again - she was going out as I was counting the shawls, and missing one, I followed her immediately, and overtook her about ten yards off; I brought her back, and she dropped it at the door, inside the shop. I did not see it fall from her - she had a large cloak on. Nobody could have dropped it but her; she denied touching it. She had only 11 1/2 d. on her.

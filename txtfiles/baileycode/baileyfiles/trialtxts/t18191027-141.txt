, On the 18th of August I missed two blankets out of a cupboard, which was locked, in the same room where the prisoner slept; I charged him with stealing them, as he had the key of the room.

            . I put the blankets into the cupboard. Nobody but the prisoner was entrusted with the key of the room. I found them at Seabeck's
CAUSTEN SEABECK. I am a labourer. My wife bought a blanket of the prisoner - he asked 2 s. for it. I gave him 2 s. for it myself. Next morning he sold me another for 1 s.

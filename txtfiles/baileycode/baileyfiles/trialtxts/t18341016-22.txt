            . I am almost eleven years of age - I know the necessity of speaking the truth - I live with my parents, in Star-street, Shadwell


. On the 30th of September, about five o'clock, I saw the two prisoners take a jacket from Mr. Kennedy's shop - Morris took it, and gave it to Jones - it was hanging outside the shop - they both ran down Fox-lane - I went and told Mr. Cuthbert.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Lawrence Kennedy, this witness, gave me information - I ran down Fox-lane, went up a turning, and saw Morris standing at a door - I went to him, and said, "You took the jacket from Mr. Kennedy's door" - he said nothing - I looked into the passage, and saw Jones with the jacket, and took him.
Morris's Defence. I saw the jacket down by a coffee-shop door.

             sworn.
Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am in the Somerset militia, I obtained a furlough to leave my regiment, and came to London; I hired myself to Messrs. Ellison and Oakley, musical instrument makers, in Fountain-court, they make instruments for Longman and Broderip. I have seen Baskerville and Geast together at different times, but never to take notice of their conversation. In the month of March, I believe it was, I was drinking at Anson's, a public-house, in Fountain-court, and Baskerville came in, and called me out to take an instrument away for Mr. Geast; when I first saw it, it was out of doors, about half-way down the arch way; Mr. Geast, the prisoner at the bar, helped me up with it on my knott; I don't know which way Baskerville went after he called me out; Geast directed me to take it to a butcher's-shop, in Noble-street, he said it was his own lodgings; I saw the butcher in the shop, and his wife, the butcher helped me up stairs with it, I was not paid for carrying it; I saw Geast several times afterwards, he told me he had no silver, he would pay me on Saturday night one shilling, for taking the instrument away; it was a square piano forte.

                   PHILLIPS
               



             sworn.
Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am a music-seller, in Manor-row, Tower-hill; I know the prisoner, I have seen him very often, I know him very well; I bought a piano forte of him in the month of February. Sometime previous to the purchase. I was at Mr. Longman's warehouse, I saw Geast, he was tuner there; he asked me if I wanted a piano forte cheap, as he knew a person who had one to disposeof; I enquired who it was; he told me his name was Longate.
Q. Do you know who that Longate is? - A. No; in about a week, or ten days, after this, he gave me a direction to call at Longate's, in Union-court, Holborn, but I had not an opportunity of going there; a day or two after that, I saw Geast, and told him I had not been able to go up to Longate's; he told me Mr. Longate wanted him to draw the strings up for the piano forte; a day or two after, a porter brought me the piano forte, the prisoner came with him, this was on Saturday, the 19th of February, about ten o'clock; he wanted the money for the piano forte; he said, that the man was very much distressed for it; he asked seven guineas; I agreed for six guineas; I told him, it Longate would step down in the morning, he might have the money as soon as he pleased; Geast came in the afternoon, and brought a receipt, as from Mr. Longate. (Produces it; it was read):
Received, February 20, 1796, of Mr. Phillips, the sum of 6l. 6s. for a piano forte.
Federick Longate.
It was a new one since the introduction of the grand piano fortes; the small ones have grown of less value. I thought I have a fair price for it.
Q. Have you ever been able to find out any thing about Longate? - A. I have not been able to find such a person. Mr. Davis called at my house, it might be a fortnight after, and saw the instrument the Geast sold me.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. 
               
                  Q. 
               


            Geast represented himself as the agent of Longate? - A. Yes.
Q. And produced the receipt of Longate? - A. Yes.
Court. (To Allen.) Q. Did you take that piano forte from Mr. Ellison's premisses, or Mr. Longman's? - A. Neither; I took it from the court.
Court. There is no proof that this property was lost from Mr. Longman's. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is stated by the Counsel, that the accomplice is a man of infamous character; an accomplice cannot be received unless a foundation is laid for the felony; and in this case, without the accomplice, there is no proof at all, as against the prisoner at the bar, that this piano forte was a piano forte in which he had any concern; and that the piano forte is the piano forte of Messrs Lon man and Broderip-Under these circumstances you must acquit him.

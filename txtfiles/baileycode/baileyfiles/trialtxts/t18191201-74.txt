            . I am a leather-seller
, and live in Brook-street, Holborn


. On the 3d of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came, asked to see a piece of dressed leather, and bought a small quantity. We have some drawers of leather on the opposite side. I had two or three customers in front of the counter, he was at the drawer, helping himself. What he bought came to 13 d., he paid 7 d., said he had no more, and that he would call for it - he went away. As soon as he shut the door I opened it; he ran off as hard as he could. I followed, caught him, and found thirteen pieces of leather between his trowsers and shirt; they where all marked.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

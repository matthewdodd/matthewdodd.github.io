            . On the 1st of December I was near the corner of Rood-lane in Fenchurch-street


, the prisoner ran between me and the wall; I felt him take something from my pocket; I turned round, and saw my handkerchief in his hand; I took it from him, and delivered him in charge of a constable.
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming from work, I saw the handkerchief lying, I took it up to look at it; the gentleman turned round, and said, you have picked my pocket; my father keeps a peter-boat, and I work at a rope-ground.
Prosecutor. There was not time enough for the prisoner to stoop to take it up, between the time of his passing me and my seeing it in his hand.

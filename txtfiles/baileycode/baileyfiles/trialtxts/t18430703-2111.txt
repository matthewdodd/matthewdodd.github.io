PATRICK DOHERTY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of July, 48lbs. weight of lead, value 8s.; the goods of 



Robert Adams, and fixed to a building; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS RUMBLE
. I am a surveyor. I was superintending a building at Pimlico for Mr. Adams—the prisoner was in the bricklayer's employ who was building there—on Monday we had missed some lead off one of the roofs—I received information—went and saw the lead was removed from the flat over one of the buildings—a piece corresponding to a portion taken off the flat was found in a basket placed in one of the kitchens—I saw it there—we set watch, and saw a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, go into the area—I went out, and at the prisoner coming along with a heavy bundle—I called him by the name he generally goes by, and said, "What have you there?"—he said, "Lead"—I said, "Come with me into the house"—he came, aad I gave him in charge of a policeman—I afterwards compared the lead with the place, and it exactly corresponded—there was about 48lbs.





NATHANIEL NORRIS
. I am a plumber—I laid this lead down. I was at Adams's house on Monday, and saw the prisoner come out of the building with the lead under his arm—he was stopped—I afterwards compared the lead with the roof—it matched a piece which was cut out—I am quite certain it had come from that spot—it is new, and had been down about three weeks.





JAMES LIGHT
 (policeman.) I took the prisoner into custody, and took change of the lead.





MAURICE MULCAHY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he it the man.




GUILTY
.—


Transported for Twelve Years.

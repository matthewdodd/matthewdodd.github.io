            . I had missed joints of meat from my shop in White-Cross-Street


. I endeavoured to find out the thief. I desired my wife to go into the house and take no notice of the shop. I went over to a Yorkshire warehouse, and told Mr. Cotton that lives there, I intended to watch my door. We both saw the prisoner take a piece that was hanging at my door: I ran over and took hold of him. This was about half an hour after seven o'clock on the 26th of December last. He dropped it close to his heels. We took it up. He had taken the beef, (it was about nine or ten pounds). hook and all.

            . Mr. Taylor told me he had lost a piece of meat, and he came to our shop to watch his own window. About half an hour after seven he ran out, and I after him. He took the prisoner by the collar, who let a piece of beef fall in the dirt. Mr. Taylor took it up. We then secured the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going to get some water, he followed me and charged me with taking some beef. He searched my bosom and found nothing at all upon me. I have worked for a person in Whitecross-Street these six years.

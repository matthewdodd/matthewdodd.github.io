LUCY SHEPPARD
. I am single, and live with the prisoner's mother, in Greenwood-street, Mile-end. On the 2nd of Aug. I went into the country, leaving the prisoner at home—I returned on the 21st of Dec, and missed the articles stated—the prisoner was not at home—I spoke to the police, and saw the prisoner at the office—these are the tongs—they are mine—the other things have not been found—I called the prisoner's mother up, and told her my room had been robbed, and she gave me the duplicate of the tongs—I also lost a watch.





JAMES HAMS

The prosecutrix gave me information, and I took the prisoner at the House of Correction, on the 9th of Jan.—I told her the charge was for breaking into Mrs. Sheppard's room, and stealing a watch, tongs, blankets, and two books—I received the duplicate of the tongs from Mrs. Sheppard, and by that I got the tongs.





EDWARD EDWARDS

I was called to the station to take charge of the prisoner, while Hand's went to her mother—the prisoner said she had committed the robbery, and taken the key from the table-drawer—that she undid the door with it, and the watch the left with Mrs. Fisher—she said she had taken a pair of blankets, a pair of sugar-tongs, a watch, and some books.

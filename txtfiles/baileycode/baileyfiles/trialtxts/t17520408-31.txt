. I missed the two spoons the 5th of March; I had seen them the night before. The prisoner lived servant with me. Mr. Young, a silver-smith at Holborn-bridge, stopp'd one of them; he advertised it; I went to his house and found it.

            , the servant-maid said, she should know the man that brought it. I fetched the prisoner to her: the maid said, he brought it. I took him before justice Fielding, there she swore it. The other was found at Mr. Crooke's at Turnstile, ( Both produced in court and deposed to) one marked M. M. S. the other M. B.
Mary Linch. The prisoner brought the spoon to Mr. Young's, my master: he said, it was his mistress's, and that the mark was for her maiden name. I had not a satisfactory account from him; so I stopp'd it. He said, he would go and fetch a person to prove it, and that his mistress's name was White; I saw no more of him till his master brought him.
Mr. Crooke deposed, the prisoner brought the other spoon to him, and said, he and another person had won it at raffling, that he bought it of him for 7 s. 10 d. wt. an ounce and half.

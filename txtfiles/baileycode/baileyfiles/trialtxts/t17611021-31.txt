.


                  Mary 
                  Ellice 
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Bellamy, she lives in Jermin-street


; the prisoner is a journeyman uphosterer
; he was at work at my mistress's house, in fitting up some restoon window-curtains, in September last. Two or three days after I missed a handkerchief, two towels, and two tea-cups. We suspected he must take them, and in searching his lodgings, we found the handkerchief. one cup, and one towel. [Produced in court.] These are my mistress's property; here is her name upon the handkerchief. The towel is of a particular sort; I never saw such besides there; my mistress brought them with her from Ireland; they are not made up; here is one of the same sort, I brought from home. [Producing it; they are compared, and correspond.] The tea-cup is part of a set of Drelden-china, [Producing a fellow to it; they correspond,] with a blue stripe down the middle of each.
Q. When was it that the prisoner worked at you house?
M. Ellice. About the 3d of October was the last time he worked for my mistress.


                  John 
                  Kirkwood 
               



            . The prisoner lodged at my house; I have seen that handkerchief, here produced, and two towels, hang up in our yard; this is one of the towels, that is here produced. When the handkerchief was brought home, the woman that the prisoner lives with put it on, and brought it down, and shewed it to my wife; she shewed her the towels and cup also. I did not think he came honestly by them. I found out where he had been at work, and I went and gave information of them. I was with the constable when he was taken up, and before the justice he declared he knew nothing of either of the things.
Q. from Prisoner. What time did you see the handkerchief?
Kirkwood. I believe it is better than a month ago; I cannot recollect the day, I believe it was in September.
Q. from Prisoner. Did you ever see the towels hang up in the yard?
Kirkwood. I never saw such as these, besides this here produced, and the other.
Prisoner. When I was before the justice I had been drinking, and was not then in a capacity of giving an answer, but I desired to be heard another time; I was sent to Clerkenwell-bridewell, and after that I was sent for again.

Kirkwood. All he said to Mr. Fielding was, he knew nothing at all of the things he was charged with.
Q. Was he in liquor?
Kirkwood. I do not believe he was.


                  Frances 
                  Kirkwood 
               



            . I am wife to the last witness; the woman that the prisoner lives with brought a China tea-cup, and two towels, and shewed them to me, and the handkerchief also. This made me very uneasy. After this, my husband went and informed the prosecutrix, and there was a search-warrant.
Q. Did the prisoner and that woman take the lodgings together?
F. Kirkwood. They did.


                  James 
                  Rowbottom 
               



            . Mr. Mason, the prisoner's master, desired me to go and get a warrant from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , to search the prisoner's lodgings. I went with it to the prisoner's lodgings, and told the woman that the prisoner lives with, that there was a handkerchief, marked with the letter B, and I must have it. She declared there was no such thing; but at last she took it off her neck, and delivered it to me, and declared the prisoner gave it her. We found also the other things here produced.
Q. Was you before the justice when the prisoner was?
Rowbottom. I was.
Q. Was he drunk or sober?
Rowbottom. He was as sober as I am now; he declared he knew nothing of any of the things. On his examination he told Sir John, that he had the towel of his wife's mother, who he said kept an inn in the country. He said he found the handkerchief on the step of the prosecutrix's door.
Q. Did you see any other cups in the prisoner's house like this cup?
Rowbottom. No, there were some others, but none like this; the woman said all the others were her own.


                  Daniel 
                  Mason 
               



            . The prisoner was a journeyman to me; he had been at work at the prosecutrix's house, in putting up three festoon window-curtains. I went to her house, and the maid desired me not to send this man any more. I asked her what was the matter? She told me what she had lost, and shewed the fellows to the towel and cup. I got a warrant, and staid in the court while the constable and others went and searched. These things that they found, agree with what the maid had before told me; and she, before the justice, swore to them as her mistress's property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the handkerchief on the step of the door; I have got witnesses.
Counsel for Prisoner. I will call those witnesses that are to your character, but I do not think the other witnesses will be of any service to you.
Prisoner. Call 
               
                  Mary 
                  Anderson 
               



            .

                  Anderson 
               



            . I remember this cup being at the prisoner's lodgings, going on between five and six months; I had two, one of them is broke; the prisoner gave them to me; and he gave me two towels, five or six months ago; he told me they were his wife's property.

Q. Is there any particular mark upon it, so as to know that from the other here produced?
M. Anderson. The other is a new one.
Q. Do you live in the same apartment with the prisoner?
M. Anderson. I do.
Q. Take care, speak the truth, great perils may attend; do not carry your affections to any man, so as to be guilty of swearing falsely. Whether you had the two towels so long as you speak of?
M. Anderson. I had indeed, indeed I had; and the cup was given me five or six months ago.
Q. Do you remember shewing the cup and handkerchief to Mrs. Kirkwood?

Q. What do you say to the handkerchief?
M. Anderson. He brought it home to me, and told me he found it one evening, and gave it to me.
Q. How long is that ago?
M. Anderson. That is going on five or six weeks ago.
Q. Did you shew her the handkerchief and cup at the same time?

                  James 
                  Chambers 
               



            . I have known the prisoner pretty near 12 months; I have been at his lodgings several times; I remember seeing a remarkable cup there, such as this; [Looking at the cup produced.] it was a China-cup, with a handle to very much like this.
Q. Did you ever see two such?
Chambers. I have seen several cups.
Q. Did you ever see this there, or any like it?
Chambers. I have seen one of those there, or one very much like it.
Q. When?
Chambers. Four or five months ago; a cup of that sort with a handle to it; having handles makes them the more remarkable; I saw one of that shape and make.
Q. Do you remember seeing any towels there?
Chambers. Towels are things a man seldom takes notice of; possibly there might be towels.
Q. What is the prisoner's character?
Chambers. I have known him to be a man of a very fair character; he is an upholsterer by trade; I have been in his company several times; I always knew him to have an extraordinary good character.
Court. Take that cup in your hand; have you drank tea out of it?
Chambers. I have; this cup, or somewhat much like it. when I have drank tea.
Q. A good handsome set of China?
Chambers. Not a set of this; this might be an odd cup, the set might be broke before.
Q. Was there any tea-pot, milk-pot, or coffeepot, of the same?
Chambers. There was no other part of the set but this; I saw one there very much resembling this.
Q. As there was but one, it was a sort of compliment to put it into a stranger's hand.
Chambers. I know I have seen such a one there.
Q. Had any of the others handles to them?
Chambers. No, only one.
Q. Where do you live?
Chambers. I live in Southampton-building, next door to the Grotto.

                  Edward 
                  Thrale 
               



            . I have known the prisoner at the bar four or five years.
Q. What is his general character?
Thrale. I never knew but what he is an honest man; he always behaved himself well; he is a hard working, honest man.

Q. What are you?
Thrale. I am a hatter, a journeyman.
Q. Where do you live?
Thrale. I live in Cow-cross.
Mason. This man swore before the justice he kept ten or a dozen men at work in Cow cross.


                  Robert 
                  Talbot 
               



            . I have known the prisoner I believe ten years; his character was very good; but I have known nothing of him the last four or five years.
- Delency. I have known him better than twelve months.
Q. What is his character?
Delency. A very honest industrious man, 'till this affair.
Q. to 
               
                  John 
                  Kirkwood 
               



            . When did you first see the cups or towels in the prisoner's room?
Kirkwood. The cup I never saw; the first time I saw the towels was about a month ago, or a little better; that was the first time they were washed, and hung up in the yard.
Q. Did you ever take notice of any other towels hanging there before?
Kirkwood. There might be a rag or two, but none like these.
Q. Whether if they had been hanging up there in that manner sooner, should you not have observed them?
Kirkwood. Yes, I should; I have seen linnen hanging in the yard, but if these towels had been there, I should have seen them; they are remarkable with stripes in the inside of them.
Q. Do you know 
               
                  James 
                  Chambers 
               



            ?
Kirkwood. I do; last Sunday night 
               
                  Molly 
                  Anderson 
               



            , and a person that calls herself the prisoner's mother, and Chambers and another man, came to my house; and as soon as the door was opened, they forced in upon me. Chambers struck at me directly, as soon as within the door. I took them both by their collars, and lugged them out into the court. The mother called out at the window, and said she was in danger of her life, and said she would swear the peace against me.
Q. Have you seen Chambers there often?
Kirkwood. I have, especially on a Sunday; he used to come and dine there.
Q. to 
               
                  Frances 
                  Kirkwood 
               



            . Have you drank tea in Anderson's room?
F. Kirkwood. I have.
Q. Have you three or four months ago?
F. Kirkwood. I think I have.
Q. Have you taken notice of china on the mantle-piece?
F. Kirkwood. I have.
Q. If there had been ever a fine piece of china on the mantle-piece, three or four months ago, should you have observed it?
F. Kirkwood. Yes, I should; I have often seen the china taken down, and cleaned.
Q. Was this cup on the mantle-piece three or four months ago?
F. Kirkwood. No, not 'till lately.
Q. How lately?
F. Kirkwood. Within this month, or five weeks.
Q. Did you see the pieces of another cup of this sort?
F. Kirkwood. No.
Q. Did she tell you she had broke one?
F. Kirkwood. No.
Q. How often have you seen the towels hang up?
F. Kirkwood. I have seen them hanging in the yard two or three times.
Q. Whether they were not better than their ordinary towels?
F. Kirkwood. They are; she shewed me them when they were first brought home; and she told me, she believed they were cabbage, when she was making them, and putting a piece of tape at the ends.
Q. At what time was that?
F. Kirkwood. To the best of my knowledge it was about the 18th or 19th of last month. She told me he brought them home the night before she shewed them to me. They were unwashed when she shewed them to me; that is, they never had been washed. I thought some poor servant might lose their place upon it.
Q. Can you be certain they never had been washed?
F. Kirkwood. She gave me them in my hands; I am sure they never had been washed.



               Guilty
            .
The jury declared they did not believe the evidence given by Anderson and Chambers; they were committed to Newgate for perjury, and Mr. Mason entered into recognizance to prosecuts them for the same next sessions.

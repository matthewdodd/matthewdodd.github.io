            . I am a publican. On Monday morning, the 16th of March, about eight o'clock, the prisoner brought four pigs down Wood's-mews, Park-lane, and offered them for sale; they were very much overdriven; he said, he could not get them to market; he asked a man of the name of Bulley, to buy them; he said, he did not want them. I gave the prisoner 2l. 10s. for them, and asked for his address; he said, "
               
                  John 
                  Shepherd
               



            , of Hayes, Middlesex." The prosecutor saw the same pigs, and claimed them.

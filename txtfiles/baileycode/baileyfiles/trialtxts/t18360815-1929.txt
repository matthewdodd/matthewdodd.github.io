WILLIAM CARTER
. I live at Tottenham. On the 15th of August, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in West-street, Smithfield—I was at the oyster-stall—she asked me to give her some oysters—I gave her one—I paid for them, and I was going on to Saffron-hill—I had not got half the length of this court, when she came and tapped me on the shoulder, and said she wanted to speak to me—I told her to speak on—she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my bag, put it in her bosom—I asked her for the bag—she said she had got none, and none she would give me—I held her till the officer came and took her.





GEORGE CRAWLEY
 (City-police-constable No. 61.) I took this prisoner, and found this bag under her arm-pit—I had a great deal of difficulty to get it.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

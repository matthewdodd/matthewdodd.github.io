            . It was laid over again, to be the property of

            . I am a weaver
, and live in Spittal Fields. On the 11th of February, I delivered eleven pounds four ounces and a half of silk, to 
               
                  John 
                  Cosins 
               



            , to weave: on his bringing it home, on the 30th of May, there was wanting one pound two ounces and a half: the prisoner was suspected, and Cosins took her up; and upon being charged with taking it, she owned, in my hearing, at the alehouse, and before the Justices in Whitechapel, and at Hick's-Hall, that she had taken seven ounces, and sold about five or six ounces to one 
               
                  Anne 
                  Levins 
               



            : it is worth 2 s. 6 d. an ounce.

                  Cosins 
               



            . The prisoner wound silk
 for me: she left me, and did not return to her work. I missed one knot of silk; the rest may be taken in skains: I took her up, on the 30th of May, near Shoreditch church, and took her into an alehouse; there she owned to the taking three ounces of silk from me; then we went to the Eight Bells, in Red-lion-street, Spittal fields, and sent for my master: there she confessed to four ounces: we carried her to the sitting justices, at Whitechapel; there she said she sold one silk to one 
               
                  Anne 
                  Levins 
               



            . She owned to taking seven ounces: she said she sold some to a man that she did not know. Then we went to Hick's-hall, and got a warrant against 
               
                  Anne 
                  Levins 
               



            ; there she confessed to taking between seven or eight ounces, at different times. She said she had a shilling an ounce for it.

            , the headborough, confirmed that of the confession.
Prisoner's Defence.
At Whitechapel, I told them I knew nothing of the silk; and at Hicks's-hall, I did not speak one word. They gave me gin, and made me drunk.

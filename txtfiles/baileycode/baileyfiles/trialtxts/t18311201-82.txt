             WEAKLEY. I am a linen-draper
, and live on Ludgate-hill. On the 4th of November, about half-past four o'clock, I was going to Cheapside - I used my handkerchief in St. Paul's church-yard, and about two minutes after, I felt a motion at my coat; Mr. Stabb, who was with me, asked if I had lost my handkerchief - I said Yes; I turned round, and seized the prisoner, he being nearest to me: I found the handkerchief put up behind him, between his coat and waistcoat - I have not a doubt of its being mine; he at first said he had not got it, and then that he had picked it up - I could not have dropped it; I gave him in charge.
Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Is your pocket in the skirt of your coat? A. Yes - I am sure I put it into my pocket, and felt it there a moment before; I am in the habit of walking a good deal with my hand in my pocket.


                  HENRY 
                  STABB
               



            . I live with Mr. Weakley, and was with him - there was a crowd, and Mr. Weakley got a-head of me; I saw the prisoner putting a handkerchief under his coat, which I thought was Mr. Weakley's - I told him, and he took it from him.

            . I am a street-keeper, and took him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)

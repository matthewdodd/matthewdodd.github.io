JOHN EDWARD GINGELL
. I am a broker, and live in Parish-court, Marylebone. On the 16th of June the prisoner came out of my shop and asked if I wanted a bottle of brandy—I saw something under his coat—I took him back, and he put the time-piece down on the table which he took it from.

Prisoner's Defence. He said "Come in doors and let me look at the brandy;" I had two bottles; he broke them and then sent for a policeman, and then he said I wanted to steal this time-piece.




GUILTY
. * Aged 50.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live in Crown-court, Broad St


. Giles's. I am a bricklayer's labourer
. I missed my coat the 23d of this month; and 
               
                  Daniel
                   Collins
               



            , that lodges with me, missed some things. I lost four shillings in money, out of a box, in the room where I lie, with my coat. I had left the box locked, about four in the afternoon, and missed them between five and six. My box was broke open.
Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?
M'Donald. I catched him with my coat, coming out at the door. He had lodged at my house four nights, up two pair of stairs; my box was on the ground floor. I took him before a magistrate, and he was committed.
Dan. Collins. I lodged in the same house. My coat and waistcoat were taken away. They were found at the pawnbroker's.

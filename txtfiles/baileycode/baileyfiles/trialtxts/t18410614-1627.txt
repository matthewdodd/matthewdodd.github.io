EDWARD PARFETT
. 1 live in Jerusalem-passage. About two o'clock in the afternoon, of the 21st of May, Griffiths came into my shop, and asked for a steel tobacco-box—while I was reaching into the window, Donoghue came in—I put the box on the counter—Griffiths said to Donoghue, "He has not got a steel box"—they both leaned on the counter, and Donoghue was putting his hand into his pocket—he had as many cheroots as he could grasp—my wife came out, and said he had got some cheroots—I laid hold of him—he threw them all back, except three—I could not tell how many he had got—Griffiths then ran out—I called, and a postman brought him back.

, stealing 1 purse, value 6d., 1 half-crown, and 8s.; the property of 



William Tibbs, from the person of 



Frances Tibbs: having been before convicted.






FRANCES TIBBS
. I am the wife of William Tibbs. On 4th Nov., between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Whitechapel—in consequence of a person speaking to me I missed my purse, which I had safe a quarter of an hour before; it contained a half-crown and 8s.—three persons, one of whom was the prisoner, were pointed out to me in a court not many yards off—they were dividing what appeared to be money—on the prisoner being told to give up the money, he said he had none—his hand was drawn from his pocket; a half-crown and 4s. fell on the ground, and this purse( produced) which is mine, was in his hand.





THOMAS FITZGERALD
. I was in Whitechapel, and saw the three persons—I saw one of them pick Mrs. Tibbs' pocket—I am sure the prisoner is one of the three—about five minutes after I saw them in the act of dividing the money—they ran away; I caught the prisoner, and said, "You have got this lady's purse"—he said, "I have not"—his hand was in his pocket, I pulled it out, some money fell from it, and he had the purse.





WILLIAM GIFFORD
 (policeman,. H 155) I took the prisoner to the station, and he said "Gifford, I suppose this will be a foreign job."

Prisoner's Defence. I am not the person.





ROBERT GIFFORD
. I am superintendent of the Ashford constabulary—

I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted May, 1848, of stealing a purse from the person, and confined one year)—I was present; the prisoner is the person—I was then in the London Police.

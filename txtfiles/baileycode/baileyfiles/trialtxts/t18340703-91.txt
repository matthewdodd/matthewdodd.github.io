DANIEL BEVIN. On the 26th of June I was coming from Spitalfields, about twelve or one o'clock; when I was in the Broadway, Bishopsgate


, I felt a tug at my pocket - I turned round, and caught the prisoner; but seeing some more just by, who I thought were his companions, I threw him on the pavement, and went to seize another; by this time the handkerchief was thrown on my arm - I had seen it in the prisoner's hand - I did not let him go till the officer came and took him.

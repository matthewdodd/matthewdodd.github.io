            . I am servant to Cornelius Norris, a broker
; he lives in Leather-lane


. On the 22d of August I was at the other shop, opposite his, and saw the prisoner leaning on a table which stood on the step of the door, for ten minutes; he then took it away with him. He had got about twenty yards when I caught him, he then put it down.

            . I was cleaning my window on the 22d of August about half past nine o'clock. The prosecutor's wife called me. I saw the prisoner pitch the table about twenty yards from the house. I ran and caught him, and said,
"Come back again to the broker's." -
"Oh, you - ," said he,
"I wont." I said he should, and gave him a push. He behaved very ill, and threw me down and kicked me. We were obliged to carry him to the office.
CORNELIUS NORRIS. The table is mine.

            ; we live at No. 2, Green-street, Theobald's row

             sworn.
I live in the same house with Mrs. Wren.
Do you remember the time when she went out on Saturday evening, the 14th of April? - As near as I can recollect, it might be between nine and ten; I live in the lower part of the house, on the first floor; during the time she was out, I did not hear any one person go out, to my knowledge; the prisoner's room is over mine.
Do you think you should, if any body had gone up? - I cannot say; but I was very still at the time, and my door was on the jar; when she came home, and gave the alarm, I went up, and was there but a little while; I have been acquainted with the prisoner a year and half, as near as I can tell.
Was the prisoner at home when Mrs. Wren went out? - I cannot say, I did not see him go out, or hear him after.

             sworn.
I was at home this evening with my wife; I did not hear any body go up stairs; we gave no heed to any body going up stairs, there are so many lodgers in the house; I do not know when the prisoner went out that evening.

             sworn.
I went out a little after nine; I believe it might be a few minutes after nine; I was back a few minutes after ten; the prisoner was in the room with me before I went out, a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; he came in, and I asked him to sit down; my wife was at home when I went out; he looked into the bedroom where this box was, and locked allabout; I did not take notice of it then, till the box was broke open; then, from something that he had done, I suspected him; I observed the window fast; to my knowledge nobody came in that way; there were no marks on the leads, and there were none in the room; I positively observed the sill of the window, and there were no marks there till I had been out of the window, and came in; I can positively say there were none before, so that I concluded, if any body else had come in that way, there must have been marks; the window is rather better than a foot high; I found the nutmeg-grater and gloves about four or five feet off the leads; I was not present when the prisoner was taken up, or searched; I was not present when he said how he came by the money, only at Hyde's office, there he said he found it at Blackfriar's-bridge.

             sworn.
I live in the same house with the prosecutor and prisoner; on Saturday evening the prisoner's wife came down into my apartment, and presently after he came down too; he told his wife and me he was going to buy a piece of ribbon; we had no conversation about money at all.
Was you in the prisoner's room on Saturday evening? - Yes, about six, I believe; I cannot positively say to the time; his wife was in the room, and his child, and my child.
What passed between you there? - I cannot recollect how long I staid.
You recollect you are upon your oath? - Yes.
How long might you stay in the room? - About half an hour.
Who did you leave in the room when you went out? - The prisoner and his wife; my child went down with me.
By whose desire? - By mine, and the prisoner desired me to take my child down; my child was fractious and cross, to the best of my remembrance, and I took him down to put him to bed, and the prisoner said his girl might go down with me; I cannot recollect whether Mrs. Wren was at home then; I went into her room after the alarm of the robbery, but not till after Mr. Wren had been out of the window; I heard say that the prisoner borrowed half a guinea; I do not know it; I never heard it said in his presence, to my knowledge.

             sworn.
I am an officer at Hyde-street office; I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 17th, I searched him, and found wrapped up in whitish-brown paper, in his fob, fourteen guineas, and some other things, but nothing that relates to this, or explains it at all; I found some silver, about seven or eight shillings; I gave him the silver again; the guineas have been in my possession ever since; when I searched him, and found such a quantity of money upon him, I asked him how he came by so much money as a journeyman carpenter; he told me he had it left him by a relation; that was before I took him out of the house; I took him at work at a gentleman's house; and went with him before a magistrate; he was there asked how he came by it, and he said he kicked it before him on Blackfriars-bridge; he said he found fifteen guineas and a half, and a shilling; that was on the Sunday evening: I told Justice Walker I should not shew the money till the woman described it: the account of her description was taken down by Justice Walker: then I gave him the money into his hands for his inspection, and he gave it me again: she described it then as she has to-day.
Mr. Knowlys. Did she describe all of it? - No Sir, not to a guinea, but three parts of it she did.
Mrs. Wren. Here are four of 1784, which I said looked fresh, and one of 1785 that looks so; here is a guinea of 1777 which is fresh also; here is one of 1779; here are six fresh guineas, four of 1784, one of 1785, one of 1777; here is the light guinea of 1768, a little smooth on the reverse, it is like the one I lost; here is anothernew guinea 1785, that makes seven fresh ones.
Do they on the whole correspond with your recollection of what you lost? - Yes, they do indeed.
Mr. Knowlys. If I understand you right, you said there were four of 1784, quite fresh; one of 1785 and one of 1777, you did not at first tell us there were two of 1785? - I did not recollect.

             sworn.
The prisoner said, he had been to see a person in the King's Bench, and he found it on Black-friars-bridge; he kicked it before him.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went home with an acquaintance of mine on the Sunday evening that this money was lost; I saw something on Blackfriars-bridge, and I kicked it and picked it up; and when I came into the Temple, I looked at it, and it was fifteen guineas and a half and a shilling; I kept it till it was advertised, for I thought a guinea or something that might be paid for advertizing, would be of more service to me than keeping all the money, and I looked into the papers at night; I spent a guinea and a half, and paid a debt and some trifles.
Mr. WADMAN sworn.
The prisoner is a journeyman carpenter
; I believe he has never lost a single day's work since I have known him; he is as regular a man as ever I knew; I never knew any thing dishonest by him in my life; I was very sorry to be compelled to come here against him now; I never knew any thing disrespectful of him before; through all our house his general character was an honest man.
Mr. Garrow. What way of business are you in? - I am a journeyman taylor.
I believe you took some pains to keep out of the way? - I never did, I will tell you the truth, Mr. and Mrs. Wren asked me; says they, the gentleman would be glad if I would appear along with them at the trial; says I, I never was at a Court; I should be glad not to appear in any thing that I know nothing at all about; then the man he made some very rash words, and he said, if it cost him five guineas, he would have me; then I said, if I am compelled to come, I must come.
I ask you whether you did not take pains to prevent being served with a subpoena, and keep your wife out of the way too? - Upon my oath, as that man said, he would have me if it cost five guineas; I did keep away in the course of the day; I did not come home to my dinner.
Upon your oath, did not you keep your self and your wife out of the way, in order that you might not be subpoened? - I did.
Did you ever hear of any legacy the prisoner had left him? - No.
Court to prisoner. You say that you was on Black-friars-bridge on the Sunday evening, and found this money? - Yes.
Had you mentioned to any body between that and the Tuesday when you was taken, any thing of this good fortune? - No, because it might be taken away again; on the Tuesday and not before, I converted one of those guineas into silver.

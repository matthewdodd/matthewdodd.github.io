             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 3d of June
, six handkerchiefs, value 34 s.
            , the goods of

JOHN OTTLEY. I am a hosier
, and live in Fleet-street


. On the morning of the 3d of June, I saw the prisoner in St. Paul's church-yard: I followed them down Fleet-street, and saw them stop at Mr. Ottley's shop: they went backward and forward, for a while, and I then saw Evans come across the road; I stopped him, and the handkerchiefs fell from under his coat; White, who was with me, crossed over and took Barnes: we had been on the opposite side of the way, and Evans crossed nearly opposite to us - I did not say any thing to Barnes.

                  WHITE
               



            . I saw the two prisoners together in St. Paul's church-yard; we followed them, and saw them stop at Mr. Ottley's window; they passed the house, and returned for about ten minutes; they then went up a court by the side of the house, and I saw them pass something from one to the other; I cannot say which it was, but I think it was Barnes passed it to Evans.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

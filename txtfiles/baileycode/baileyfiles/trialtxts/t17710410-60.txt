            . I am servant
 to Mr. Bromwich, a soap boiler in Wapping. Last Tuesday was fortnight, between two and three in the evening I went to the Crown alehouse in White's yard, Nightingale lane. I did not know the way, so I inquired. One Robinson came up to me, and said he would shew me; he carried me to the prisoner's, Hancock's, house. I said that was not the place. She said it was her lodging. She took hold of me, and wanted me to send for something to drink. She began to feel about my pockets; I had half a guinea loose in my waistcoat pocket; I put my hand into my pocket to save the half guinea. I took it out in my hand; I don't know whether she saw me take it out or no, but she got it out of my hand. I struggled with her; she handed it to 
               
                  Mary
                   Wilson
               



            , as I suppose; because she said, Here Polly, take it. 
               
                  Mary
                   Wilson
               



             reached her hand out to Robinson to take it; I searched her, she had no money. Then Hancock took up a poker, and said she would knock my brains out if I did not quit the house. I went away for fear of my life. I took them up next day. Hancock was very abusive: she said she would swear before the justice that I gave her the half guinea for to bugger her; they were carried before the justice, and were committed.
(Creek, the watchman, deposed that he went with the prosecutor to take them up, and said they were very abusive.)
Hancock's Defence.
I had not seen the prosecutor that night. I was surprised to find him and a constable come in at that time of night. I told the constable I knew nothing of this man nor his charge. He took out word to be forth coming next day.

            . The prosecutor would have made it up if we would have given him a guinea and half; and he met some of our friends at the Nag's Head.
(She called 
               
                  Ann
                   Erwine
               



            , who deposed that the prosecutor had proposed to stop the prosecuting her for a sum of money, which was positively denied the prosecutor.)

ABRAHAM WIVELL. I am a portrait-painter
. On the 6th of July I was in Wardour-street, Soho


 - I felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner, and the handkerchief fell from him; I collared him - he said he did not pull it from my pocket, that it was a boy who had run away - I saw no other boy, and it was impossible that any other boy could have run away, as there was a board which formed a passage. and I must have seen him - and from the time I felt it go there was not time.
ANDREW FISHER. I was on duty, and took the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)

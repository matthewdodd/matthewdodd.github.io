            . I live at Dorking, Surrey. On the 4th of October, I left my horse and chaise in care of a boy in Judd-street, Brunswick-square


, about five o'clock in the evening. While I was absent the coat was stolen.

            . I was minding the horse, the prisoner came up, and asked me to let him hold it. I said I would let nobody hold it. He took the coat off the horse, I ran after him, called Stop thief! and Kemp stopped him.

            . I ran after the prisoner, and saw him throw the coat into an area. I followed and collared him, he said, he knew nothing of it. I am sure he is the man.

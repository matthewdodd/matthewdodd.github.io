CHARLES RAWLINSON
. I live in Queen-street, Marylebone, and am a grocer. On the 18th of March, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in the parlour behind the shop—I saw the prisoner put his arm round the door post, and take a piece of soap—I followed him up a street to John-street, Edgware-road, where I took him—the soap was thrown down—a little girl picked it up, and gave it to my wife—I have no doubt this is the soap I saw him take.





JOHN HUNT
 (police-constablr D 34.) I took the prisoner. He said he had not taken the soap, but that there was a man along with him that took it—I asked who he was, but he would not tell me.

Prisoner. I was going to get a quarter of an ounce of tobacoo—before

I got into the door, he ran up, and called "Stop thief"—I went up the street—he told the Magistrate he was in the parlour—he laid I came into the shop, and then he said it was round the corner of the door.





CHARLES RAWLINSON
. I did not say he came into the shop—he put himself round the door post—I am quite confident that he took it.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

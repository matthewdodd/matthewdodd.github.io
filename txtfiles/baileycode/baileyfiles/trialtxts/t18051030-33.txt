ANN TURNER sworn. - Q. What day did the prisoner at the bar come to you? - A. On the 2d of September.
Q. Did you take her without a character? - A. I took her from her parents; she told me her master was dead; she came to me on the Monday morning and staid till the Sunday following; on Sunday morning I heard the child cry (she had the care of the child) about half after eight o'clock; I went up stairs; I then found she was gone; I missed a petticoat, a shift, a square piece of cotton, two pair of stockings, one pair silk, the other pair was cotton, and a pair of shoes; I had seen them the over-night at twelve oclock.
Q. Where had they been left? - 
               A. 
            Some of the things were on the line in the kitchen; the comb, which was set in silver was in the table-drawer; I had missed that a day or two before; the shoes were under the drawers. In consequence of information, I saw her on the Sunday following; I found her at her father's; I had a search-warrant and searched the house, and in the front two-pair of stairs room, where this girl lived, I found a bit of cotton; the petticoat had been cut up into an apron; and a pair of stockings, which I did not know I had lost, they were all mine. The constable found some duplicates there, one of them led to my pocket handkerchief.

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I live at the corner of Dean-street, Holborn: On the 10th of September, the prisoner Mary Baldwin (she is the youngest, and she is the sister of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Baldwin
               



            ) pledged two pocket handkerchiefs.
Prosecutrix. I lost but one; this is mine.
Lee. On the 2d of October there was a frock and two habit-shirts pledged by Mary Baldwin.
Prosecutrix. Only one habit-shirt and apron is mine (Ann Baldwin was my servant), the apron is made out of my petticoat, I know it by the tuck that is in it now, the same tuck was in the petticoat, and by the stain of red wine in the front.

                  CHAPMAN
               



             sworn. - On the 2d of October I went with a search-warrant to the prisoners' mother's house; I found the duplicates which I produce, upon the mother.
Q. You should have indicted the mother, the child appears to be only an instrument in the hands of the mother - why did not you indict the mother? - A. The reason of the mother not being indicted was, she had got a dying infant in her lap; the mother has run away since.
Q. That is no reason you should indict the young girl as a receiver; she is only the instrument of the mother's receiving? - A. We could not tell whether she took the things home; I found a pair of stockings in the room where the bed was.
Prosecutrix. They are my stockings.
Ann Baldwin's defence. My mother asked me how I came by the things; I told her the lady gave them to me.

LUCY MOBBS
. I am the wife of Benjamin Mobbs, and live at Battersea rise. About 11 o'clock on the 6th of August, one of my children had a shoe on, and the other he was playing with—I missed them both, and a pocket handkerchief off the table—I did not see the prisoner, but from what the child said, I sent the policeman in pursuit—he brought back the shoes and handkerchief—these are them—(looking at them)—our door is generally open—the child was in the house.





WILLIAM MURPHY
. I am a policeman. I went in pursuit, and found the prisoners about a mile from the prosecutor's house—I found the shoes

and handkerchief on Fitzgerald, but nothing on Cooney—I was present before the Magistrate when the prisoners made a statement, which was taken down and read over to them—I know the Magistrate's hand-writing—this is it—(reads)—"The prisoner Cooney, being duly cautioned, says, I picked up the shoes lying at the door, and the handkerchief which was lying there, and gave them to Fitzgerald"—the prisoner refused to sign this.

Cooney's Defence. I picked them up outside the door, and gave them to Fitzgerald.

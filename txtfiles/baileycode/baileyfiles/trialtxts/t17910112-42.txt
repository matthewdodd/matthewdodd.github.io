             sworn.
I am a tea-dealer and grocer in St. George's Fields. I packed this basket of grocery, on Tuesday, the 11th of January, directed to T. Frewen, Windsor, by the waggon.

             sworn.
I am a clerk to the waggon, and bookkeeper, at the Bull and Mouth Inn. On Tuesday, the 11th of January, I remember receiving a basket for the waggon, directed to T. Frewen, Windsor, to go by Smith's Windsor waggon, on Saturday next; it was deposited in the waggon warehouse: I know nothing of the prisoners.

             sworn.
I am a waggoner at the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street. I remember seeing the two prisoners coming just out of the back door of my house; I heard a conversation between them; they appeared to be coming out of the Castle and Falcon yard; the only coversation I heard, was, the man in the blue coat said to the other with the basket on his back (that is Smith) you took notice that I paid you fore handed; that was repeated twice or thrice before they came out of the gateway; and I mentioned it to my servants; it was a basket similar to that; it was half past two.

             sworn.
I was a constable the last year: there is a man of the name of Lakin lives there; I know the prisoner Lewis; they call him Taff; he lived at Mr. Lakin's; upon Mr. Lakin applying to me, I went to his house; I went up one pair of stairs, and found Lewis in his own lodging-room, with this basket; I asked him how he came by that basket? he said it came out of the country; says I, where is the direction? says he, there is no direction upon it, I have pulled that off; the other prisoner was not there then; I never saw him; says I, have you no letter, nor any thing for it? no, he said: then I told him I should detain him; and I went for the constable, and he came; and then it was opened; the prisoner said it contained clothes that came out of the country, from some friend; when the constable came, the basket was opened, and it contained grocery goods; and through the bill of parcels, application was made to Mr. Frewen; Mr. Wright has had the custody of the basket ever since; when I brought down Lewis, Smith was in the shop.

                   WRIGHT
               



             sworn.
I am a constable. About three in the afternoon, of the 12th of January, I went to Lakin's house on Bell's application; I found both the prisoners, Mr. Bell, and several other people; the packet was produced to me; I asked the prisoners, but particularly Lewis, where he got it, who said it was his property; the other said he was only porter; I asked 
               
                  Lewis
               


             the contents of it? he said it was clothes, dirty clothes, or foul clothes, that came out of the country, from his friends; says I, have you any letter to shew where you brought these from? he said, no, I have not; says I, it is very extraordinary, this is a very handsome package, I will cut it open; I did, and it contained a many things more thanare in this bill of parcels; it contained every article of the goods that are mentioned in this bill of parcels; it is in the same state in which I found it at Lakin's house; Smith said, that they brought it from the Castle and Falcon; I took this out of Lewis's left hand breeches pocket; what they call the drag; and I found a key in his pocket, and I took it out; I searched his chest, and found a great deal of property in his chest; in his pockets I found three handkerchiefs, one marked C. M. a very good one, and two more without a mark.

                   LAKIN
               



             sworn.
I live in Chick-lane.
What are you? - A jobbing smith.
You keep an iron shop, do not you? - Yes; that does not fit me.
Did either of the prisoners lodge with you? - Yes, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Lewis
               



            .
On the day he was taken up, did you see him at your house? - Yes, between eleven and twelve; he was very much fuddled; he said he was going to the Castle and Falcon, on some business with a young man; and he went out, and came in again about three with the prisoner Smith, and a young man with him, in a kind of servant's dress; and the prisoner Smith had a load on his head; I do not know his name; I never saw him before; Lewis came in first; he was more fuddled than he was before; I asked him who that belonged to, and where it came from? says I, Lewis, it does not seem as how your acquaintance is able to send you any thing of the kind similar to this; he said it came from the Castle and Falcon; and I immediately thinking it was not proper for me to conceal any thing of the kind, though I keep an old iron shop, gentlemen, sent for Mr. Wright, and he came and cut it open.
Are you a jobbing Smith? - Yes.
Did you ever see that before? (shewing him the drag.) - Yes.
Whose property is it? - Lewis's; I cannot tell who made it; it was very hard weather; and in St. James's Park they broke the ice, and they went there and dragged the fish out of it, as I heard him say; I do not know that I have seen it this six months or twelve months; but I have seen him have such a thing in his hand.
(The things deposed to.)

            ? - The master of the Bull and Mouth inn; he is chargeable.
PRISONER LEWIS's DEFENCE.
I was at the Castle and Falcon, and a gentleman in a white apron applied to me, and said he wanted somebody to carry that parcel to Bleeding-hart-yard; I was too drunk to carry it, and this man carried it; and I said I would give the young gentleman a bit of small cane; and we called at home, and Bell came up and took the parcel.
The prisoner called 
               
                  Richard
                   Lakin
               



             to his character.
PRISONER SMITH's DEFENCE.
I was in the tap-room, and a gentleman's servant came in; and we brought the parcel to Lewis's lodging; who brought the parcel to the Castle and Falcon, I do not know; Lewis was so drunk, he could not carry the parcel, and he hired me to carry it.

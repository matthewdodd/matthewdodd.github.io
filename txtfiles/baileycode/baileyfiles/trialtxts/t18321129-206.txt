On the 26th of November, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others, at the corner of Judd-street and Speldhurst-street, Brunswick-square; seeing me they immediately separated - I saw the prisoner had something under his arm; I followed him to Coram-street; he turned into a dark corner, and threw something down; I immediately laid hold of him, and asked what he had there - he said nothing; I told him to pick up what he had put down; he said I might be d - d; I gave him to another officer -I found two carriage lamps there, which I found belonged to the prosecutrix.

Prisoner's Defence. I stopped to speak to a young man; I left him, and the Policeman followed me and said, "What have you got?" I said, "I have nothing" - he said, "Pick up what you have there" - I said, "I don't know that any thing is there."

; standing there I thought I felt something in my pocket, I turned about and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, he seeing me look at him let it fall, I took hold on him, and took up the handkerchief.
Q. When had you seen your handkerchief last before that?
Clark. I had made use of it but a little time before; the prisoner said it was not him, it was another boy; but there were none near him.

There was a great mob at the corner of the street, and many other people besides me.

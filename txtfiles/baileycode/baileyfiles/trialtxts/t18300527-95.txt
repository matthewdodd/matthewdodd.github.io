            . I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Keary - he lives in Strutton-ground


. On Saturday night, the 8th of May, I was serving two ladies at the butter-counter; the prisoner came in, took a piece of pork off the stall-board, and shoved it into her basket; she then went to the cheese-counter, took a piece of cheese, and put that into her basket; she was going to take another piece, but I went up to her - this is not the first, second, or third time she has done it in our shop, and I have let her go; I gave charge of her, and 14s. 6d. was found on her, so that it was not done for want.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to receive my husband's wages; I got a sovereign, and got a little drunk - I am subject to epilepsy, and felt it coming on; I went to this shop to buy some butter and cheese, but whether I paid for what I had I do not know; I never knew I was in custody till the next morning.

; I had a surtout-coat, wrapped up in a paper, and my address on it, under the back seat of the chaise - I was on the front seat; it rained - Ibuttoned myself up, and on turning the coat was gone: I saw a Police-officer, and told him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. I was on duty in East-road, near the City-road, and saw the prisoner near the Three Crowns; I suspected he had something; I went to stop him - he ran down Brunswick-place, and I followed him; he dropped this parcel from under his smock-frock, and ran on to Charles-square.

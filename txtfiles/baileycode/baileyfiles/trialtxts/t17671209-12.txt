            . On Friday the 20th of November; between six and seven in the evening, coming up Darkhouse-lane


, a little boy came and said, have you not lost your handkerchief; I put my hand in my pocket, and said I had; he said he saw a boy put his hand in my pocket just now; we walked up to the top of the lane, and in the street saw four boys; he said it was one of them; I walked towards them; they looked very hard at me; the prisoner ran away as hard as he could, which gave me reason to suspect him; I pursued and took him opposite a fishmonger's in Thames-street; before ever I accused him, he said, indeed, Sir, I have not got your handkerchief; I took him into a shop, and saw my handkerchief taken out of his pocket.
Prisoner's defence.
I had been over the water, and coming along I saw a handkerchief lying against a door; I took it up, and this gentleman came and took me into a fishmonger's shop, and said it was his handkerchief.

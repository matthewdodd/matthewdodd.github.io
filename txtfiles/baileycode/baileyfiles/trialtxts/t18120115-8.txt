            . I am warehouse-man to the prosecutors, their names are 
               
                  John 
                  Lawrence

                  Lawrence
               



            . The warehouse is 22, Ludgate-street


, they do not live there none of them. The prisoner was foreman to the glazier
 that we employed. On the 9th of this month he came in the morning about eight o'clock, he repaired the glass and there was one square of glass noticed to be too small which made it necessary to come the next morning. In consequence of suspicion we had the conduct of the prisoner watched the next day. Before the prisoner came I noticed the position of the shawls so as to know if any was taken, they were within half a yard of the window that was to be altered.
Q. In order to do this, was the prisoner inside or outside - A. He was inside when I saw him first, he was there about half an hour. When the prisoner left the shop I gave 
               
                  John 
                  Moodey
               



             directions to follow him; I examined the shawls before the prisoner got well from the door, I missed the shawls as the prisoner was going out of the door. Moodey went out and returned with the prisoner; I then charged the prisoner with having taken the shawls; he first denied it, he afterwards produced one, I then ordered Moodey to go for an officer, and then he produced four more, there were two or three came out of his hat, and one or two out of his pockets. I looked at the shawls, I knew them to be our property.
Q. Who occupies the warehouse - A. The ware housemen and porter in the employ of the firm, and two maid servants, they are all in the employ of the firm, it is in the parish of St. Gregory's, by St. Paul's.

            . I am warehouse-man to Messrs. Lawrence and Jollands In consequence of directions I brought the prisoner back; the prisoner produced one before I went for the officer, and four after I came back, I came back before the officer came.
DOWNING. I am a porter at this warehouse, I received the goods from the last witness.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character.

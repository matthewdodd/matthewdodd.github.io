            . I am a cow-keeper
, and live at Mile End


. The prisoner was my servant
. I lost a great deal of clover, and suspected him. I wrote my name on a piece of paper, and put it in the middle of a truss. On the 17th of November, when he came home in the evening, he said he had taken it, and begged for mercy. I had set the officer to watch.

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor set me to watch - I saw the prisoner, with a truss of clover, tied behind the wash-tub, which he was taking to a house. I saw him putting the clover into a cart - I seized him, and found the prosecutor's name in the truss.
Prisoner's Defence. I took it for the horse-the horse ran away, and I threw the clover into a cart.

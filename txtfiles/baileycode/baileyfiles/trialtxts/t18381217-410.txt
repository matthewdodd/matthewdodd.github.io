or stealing, on the 
20th of November, 35lbs. weight of pig-iron, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



William Graham and another, in a certain barge, on the navigable 
river Thames.






JAMES BENBOW
. I am an iron-founder, and live at No. 32, Bankside, Southwark. On the morning of the 20th of November, I saw both the prisoners, and another, get into a barge, called The Chandler, lying off Chandler's Wharf, which is next to mine, and throw a quantity of pigs of iron off on to the shore—it was near low-water, the tide had left the barge—I watched them—they carried it twenty or thirty yards, and placed it under a punt—I finished dressing myself, and then went to Mr. Chandler, and he followed them with me—we caught the prisoners at the top of the bridge-steps—Ragan had a basket with the iron in it—they were in company all the time, and both had been in the barge—we took them to the station-house, went to the shore with an officer, and found one piece remaining there—the other one saw me watching them, and ran away—I knew them before.






JOHN BELL
. I live in Thames-street. The barge Chandler and the iron in it belongs to Robert and William Graham.





JAMES FORBES
. This appears to be part of the iron the barge was loaded with—I have weighed the iron in the barge, and there is 18 cwt. short.

Chambers. I was coming through the Borough market by Southwark bridge, and met Ragan coming along with the iron.

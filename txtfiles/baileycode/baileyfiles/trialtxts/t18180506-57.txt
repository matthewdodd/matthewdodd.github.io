            . I live in Warwick-court, Holborn. On the 12th of April, about eleven o'clock, I was going along Holborn


, a man pushed me behind near Fullwood's-rents-the prisoner met me, and snatched at my watch; the handle of my watch broke - He got the seals. I collared him - He broke from me; I collared him again, we both fell together; he got away, and ran down Southampton-buildings - I secured him there, and never lost sight of him. I am certain he is the man.

. On the 3rd of November the prisoner, who had been turned into the streets by her friends, told me she had no where to go - I said I was poor myself, and had been distrained on for rent, but till she could get into the workhouse she might sleep in my place; she was three days with me - I then missed a shilling, and told her to leave my house; when she was gone I missed the articles stated in the indictment.
Prisoner. Q. You say your husband's name is Richard, have you not been living with another woman's husband for eighteen years? A. I am regularly married.

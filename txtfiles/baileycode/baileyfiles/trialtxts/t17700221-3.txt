            . I am servant to Mrs. White, a pawnbroker, in Well-close-square. On the 26th of December, between nine and ten in the evening, the prisoner brought this gown, and asked half a crown upon it, and I lent her eighteen pence.

Mrs. Barlow desired me to go and pawn the gown for her, and not to let her husband know of it. I went and got eighteen pence upon it, and delivered it to her.

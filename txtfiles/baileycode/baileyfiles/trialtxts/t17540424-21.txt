            . I went to Mr. Abbot's at Wapping, to measure a parcel of plank for him; when I came there, I saw a plank that I had measured for Mr. Walker, there was the mark T. A. and our own mark, which we put on planks when we measure them; I particularly remember this plank from the rest we then measured: we had made several impressions on it with a gouge in several places, and having my book about me I saw it answered in every particular. I said, I was positive it was Mr. Walker's; Mr. Abbot said, he bought it of the prisoner at the bar, upon which he was taken up.

            . I bought the plank of the prisoner at the bar.
Q. to Cole. Where is Mr. Walker?
Cole. He is here; but from among so many he cannot swear to that particular plank.
Q. to Abbot. What did you give for it?
Abbot. I gave a guinea for it.
Cole. That is as much as any man would have given.
Prisoner's Defence.
A man brought it to me about twelve at noon in a boat, and asked me if I could sell it, and when he heard I was taken up he ran away.

SARAH WORKMAN
. I am the wife of Henry Workman, who keeps greengrocer's shop in Hall-street, Poplar—on the 11th of February I went out about four o'clock in the afternoon, and left three or four of my children in the shop, and about 5s. and some halfpence and farthings in the till—I came back in about half-an-hour—I went to get some money from my till, and there was none there—in consequence of what my children told me I went to the prisoner's—I asked him what business he had in my shop, and what he had done with the money he took out of the till—he at first denied it—his mother put her hand into his pocket and took three shillings and some farthings out, and gave them to me—I asked what he had done with the rest—he said that was all he had taken out of the till.





THOMAS SMITHERS
 (police-sergeant K 3.) The prisoner was brought to the station at five o'clock in the evening of the 18th of February—I received three shillings and five farthings from the prosecutrix—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the remainder of the money—he said that was all he had taken.

Prisoner's Defence. The woman said I took it at four o'clock, and I was taking my father's tea at that time.
(Sophia Hunter, wife of a cook on board a ship, living in Hall-street; and Mary Jane Dubar, wife of the chief officer of the Thames, East Indiaman; gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutrix.

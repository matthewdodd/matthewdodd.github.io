JOHN EVANS
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of Oct., 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



John Penny, from his person.






JOHN PENNY
. I am a porter and live at No. 13, William-street, Lissongrove, Marylebone. On the 15th of Oct., in the evening, I was in a beer-shop, in Exeter-street, Sloane-street—the prisoner was sitting next me there—I missed my handkerchief—there were about eight or ten persons in the room besides—I mentioned my loss, and every person began to turn their pockets inside out, except the prisoner—I have since seen my handkerchief in the hands of a pawnbroker—this now produced is it.





JOHN KILLINGWORTH
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Mr. Perkins's, King's-road, Chelsea, about a quarter of a mile from Exeter-street, or nearly half a mile. On the afternoon of the 16th of Oct. this handkerchief was pledged at our shop—I am not sure the prisoner is the person who pledged it—I have seen him before—it was pledged in the name of John Evans—I produce our duplicate.





FREDERICK LANGSTON
. (police-constable V 36.) On the 31st of Oct. I

took the prisoner into custody—I searched him, and found fifteen duplicates, one relating to a handkerchief pawned for 1s. at Mr. Perkins's, in King's-road, Chelsea, on the 16th of Oct.

J. KILLINGWORTH
re-examined. These tickets were both written by myself—the one produced by the officer is the one I delivered to the person pawning the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the handkerchief.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(Sarah Doyle, of New-road, Chelsea, deposed to the prisoner's good character; but Langston stated that she had been active in pawning the stolen property in the former indictment.)

WILLIAM MUNNINGS THOMAS
. I am a clerk in the Coast Guard Office in the Custom House, and live in Warwick-square. On Monday the 5th of this month, I went to Drury-lane theatre, at half-price—I waisted there for half-price to commence—there were a number of people waiting as well as me—I had a silk handkerchief on my neck, which I took off—I dropped it with my gloves—the prisoner picked them up and offered them

back to me—he made a half bow and said, "Shall I hold them for you?" while I was tying my neckcloth and putting my collar to rights—I do not know that I answered him, but I made a kind of bow of assent, and went on adjusting my black handkerchief and collar—I then turned round to receive my handkerchief and gloves, but the prisoner was gone—I went after him, and found him in about half an hour, under the piazza of Covent-garden—he said he had been looking for me, and he said, "You will think it odd, "or "think me odd, but I caught a glimpse of a friend, and at the impulse of the moment I rushed after him, quite forgetting that I had your things, but could not find him"—I said I was very glad we had met, and asked him for my handkerchief—he looked at himself and said, "I have just been to change my coat, and having given up the idea of seeing you again this evening, I have left the gloves and handkerchief in the coat, "but he said if I was walking his way we would go and fetch them—he then took hold of my arm, and asked me to go into a public-house opposite, first, to see if his friend was there—we went in, but there was no one there that looked likely to be his friend—I observed to him that there seemed to be nobody there who knew him, and was proposing to go—he then asked me whether I would not have any thing to drink—I said I really did not want anything—I appeared rather vexed, and proposed going—when we got out of the house he said I might any morning find him at a large shop in St. Paul's churchyard—he again took hold of my arm, and said we would go to his rooms—we walked up to a house in Brownlow-street, and when we came to a kind of public entrance to several rooms, the door was open—he stopped me and said, "I will run up and fetch your handkerchief and gloves, I won't trouble you to come up"—this staircase seemed to have a thoroughfare at the foot of it, out behind into a yard, or some other street—I fancied he wanted to escape with my property, and I told him it would not be the least trouble, and I had rather accompany him up and fetch them—there was a woman on the staircase with a light, which she gave to the prisoner—he went up to his room, opened the door, and walked in, I following him—the room struck me as rather an odd one, not at all according with the person's appearance, it was very shabby—and on my turning round the prisoner had slipped back and shut the door, and was taking the key out of the lock and putting it into his pocket—I was very much alarmed, and thought I had fallen into a snare of some kind, but I tried to look as calm and collected as possible, and I civilly asked him for my handkerchief—he said "Ah, we will talk of that presently, let us have something to drink," at the same time holding out his hand to me to supply it, and I wishing to keep on terms with him, and being in fear, gave him a shilling: when be immediately said, "Come, I know you have a sovereign about you"—I assured him I had not one—he again said he was quite sure I had; it was all nonsense, and on my saying I really had not any thing more about me, he stepped forward, or rather rushed forward, and seized my cloak from off the chair which was standing by me—it was half on the chair—I had it on my arm when I came in—he said, "I must keep this till you bring me one"—it was lying on the front of the chair—whether part of it was on my arm, or sleeve, or not, I cannot say—it had slipped off, and I think the sleeve might be on my arm—I had never thrown it from me, but in feeling for the shilling it had slipped off—I was touching it—my knee was against it—I then remonstrated with him, and he retorted, "I did not ask you to come up"—I said it might have been as well if we had brought a third person—he asked what I meant—I muttered something

about the police, when he said, "Ah, a pretty figure you would appear in the papers before all your friends as a d----d s—d"—I did not reply to that, and he said, throwing the cloak on the bed, "Well, we will say nothing more of that; if you will bring me the sovereign you shall have the cloak, but you must let me have something more to keep till you bring me the sovereign; "and upon my again assuring him that I really had nothing more about me, and in feeling my waistcoat-pockets at the same time, my under-coat flew open, or I opened it myself, and he spied two shirt-studs which I had, and also a ring which I had on my finger—he immediately demanded them—but I stood out for those, and said, "Nothing shall induce me to part with these"—he said, "Well, well, I do not wish to be hard upon you; you will bring me the sovereign I am sure, won't you?"—I said, "I will, but I am sure I will not bring it to this place"—he then asked me whether I would bring it to the Piazza, where we had met in the evening—I said I would—he asked me whether I would come on Thursday, and I, thinking it was then Tuesday evening instead of Monday, (and wishing to gain time if I took any advice,) said I should be out on Thursday, but would come on Friday—he then came round in a more familiar manner (he had been walking about)—he stirred the fire and patted or touched me on the shoulder, saying, "I am sure I can depend on your coming, my good fellow"—he then said we would go and get something to drink, and he unlocked the door, but did not put on his hat—he accompanied me down stairs, and again reminded me of the appointment on Friday evening, and we parted—next morning I went to a friend, who was an attorney, on my way to the Custom House, but he had not come to his office—I went to the Custom House, and got away a little earlier than usual, and went to a friend, a barrister in Gray's Inn, for advice, and I went immediately to Marlborough-street police-office—the Magistrates had separated, and I went to the house of the senior Magistrate, Mr. Dyer, who told me to come to the office next morning, and he there granted me a warrant against the prisoner, and introduced me to Schofield the officer, who went with me down to the neighbourhood of the theatres—Schofield directed me to walk before him—after walking some time, I fancied I saw the prisoner at some distance before me in a M'Intosh cloak—Schofield gave me directions how to act, and in another street, close by there, I purposely brushed up against him, and came in contact with him—on our recognising each other, he said, "Yes, here I am, and in your cloak, too"—I made signs to Schofield, and he came up and took the prisoner—he then denied ever having seen me before, and said the cloak was his own—I can positively swear to the cloak he had on being mine.

Prisoner. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate I seized the cloak which you threw across the chair? A. I told him you snatched the cloak off the chair—I had brought it from the theatre with me on my back—I had it on when we went to the public-house.





BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD
. I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street office. The prosecutor came to me on Wednesday last, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon—I went with him about eight o'clock towards Drury-lane theatre, and just at the end of Marquis-court, Drury-lane, he pointed out the prisoner to me, in company with three others—I walked up to them, where they were all stopping, in Vinegar-yard—the prisoner, on the prosecutor coming up to him, walked off at a very quick rate—he went through Cross-court, Russell-court, into Drury-lane, turning round the corner of White Hart-street, where I passed the prosecutor and the prisoner in conversation

together—I heard them speaking together—I immediately turned round, after passing them, took hold of the prisoner, and said he was say prisoner, as I had a warrant against him for felony—I asked him if he knew the gentleman he was talking to, pointing to the prosecutor—he said, "No, I never saw him before in my life"—I asked him if he recollected taking a pocket-handkerchief and a pair of gloves at the theatre on Monday night last from a gentleman—he said, "No, nothing of the kind"—I asked if he recollected going to his lodging on Monday night with a gentleman—he said no, he did not recollect any one at all—I asked him if he recollected any thing about a cloak that he had had of a gentleman—he answered no, he had not—I then took him into the Marlborough Head public-house, Marlborough-street, opposite the office—I called the prosecutor in, who immediately identified this cloak, which was on the prisoner—the prisoner most positively denied it being his, and said it was his own—he likewise said to the prosecutor, "You never saw me with your eyes before in your life, and I never saw you"—I repeatedly asked the prisoner for his name and address, which he refused to give me—on the following day he gave the name of John Davis before the Magistrate, and requested me to go to his uncle to make inquiry about him—his examination was not taken down in writing at that time—it was merely an investigation taking place—it was on Thursday—his examination was not taken till Saturday—he wrote his uncle's address on the back of the warrant, "Mr. Price, edge-tool maker, Curtain-road, Shoreditch"—I went there, and saw Mr. Price, and found they were not related—this is the cloak I took off the prisoner, and here is a pair of gloves which were in the pocket.





WILLIAM MUNNINGS

re-examined I can swear to this cloak from one or two marks—I mentioned before I saw it that there was a little burant hole in the cuff, and I pulled the cuff down, and found it there—the buttons are the same, and there is a shooting flap which I know it by—I can swear to the cloak most positively—it is the same I have spoken of.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not meet me on Monday week in Wych-street, about eight o'clock near Madame Vestris' Theatre, as I was looking into as print-shop? A. No—I did not ask you if you had read "Fanny Hill"—I did not ask you where you were going, and you did not say you were going into the Strand—I did not ask you to have any thing to drink—I came through Wych-street, if that is street Madame Vestris' theatre is in, on my way to Drury-lane—I cannot say at what time, but when I got to the theatre half-price had not commenced—I will swear I did not stop to look into a print-shop—I might turn my head it there was a shop with a light in it, but I did not stop at any shop, not for one moment—I walked on the same side as the print-shop, I think—I crossed over to go to the theatre—I know there is a print-shop there—I do not know Dugdale's shop—I never heard that name before—I did not walk with you from that shop to the end of Drury-lane—I did not ask you where you lived.

Prisoner's Defence. After we passed the side of Drury-lane, theatre which leads to Lincoln's-Inn-fields, he asked me where I lived—I told him with Mr. and Mrs. Nelson—he said, "Suppose I go with you to your lodging, we will have something to drink there"—I said I had no objection, very likely Mrs. Nelson would be there, and we could have a comfortable glass together—we then walked on till we came to Brownlow-street—I went up stairs, and when he came up I asked him to sit down, and told him Mrs. Nelson was out, and would not be long before she was

in—I stirred up the fire—he sat down, took off his M'Intosh cloak, and threw it on chair—he then said, "What shall we have to drink?"—I said, "A little gin, if you like, "and he gave me a shilling out of his waistcoat pocket to fetch the gin—I fetched sixpennyworth, and gave him 6d. change—he waited in the room while I went for it—we were talking about one thing or another—I told him I had to go out a great deal in the wet—he said he should be very happy to see me and my landlady, and so on, and he promised me the cloak, which was then on the chair, till Friday night—this was on the Monday night, and I was to meet him under the piazza of Covent-garden—he asked me if I was fond of reading—I told him I was—he said he would bring me two or three books, and he hoped he should be better acquainted with me, and he should like to see my landlady—after he had sat about an hour, he said, "Well you will see me down stairs?"—I took the light, and said, "You know the direction, No. 18, Brownlow-street"—he said, "Yes, I do, "and I bid him good night at the bottom of the stairs—I did not expect to be tried so soon, or I could have had friends here.

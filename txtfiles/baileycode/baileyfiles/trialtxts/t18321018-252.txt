. The prisoner was in my service, as nurse
, for four or five weeks; my wife came home on the Sunday night previous to the Saturday the prisoner was taken - she took off a brooch and laid it on the glass; that was missgin - we inquired, and could not find any thing of it; my wife then ordered her to look up the plate, and the two spoons were missing - I gave her in charge.

Prisoner. What she says is true.

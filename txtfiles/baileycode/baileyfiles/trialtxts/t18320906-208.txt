. On the 31st of August, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a halfpenny pen; he put down sixpence, and I gave him a pen and 5 1/2d. - he stood at the counter; I was making up my accounts, and this money was on the counter - immediately I gave him the pen, I saw him snatch the five sovereigns out of the bowl; he got out of the shop, but was caught by two officers, without my losing sight of him - he fell on the ground, and the three sovereigns were under him; the other two were never found - I asked what he had done with the other two; he said the man who had picked the others up, was as likely to have them as him.

Prisoner's Defence. I came out of his shop, and shut the door; I proceeded fifty yards, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - seeing a man run, I ran after him, and by St. Dunstan's church, I stopped, seeing I was pursued.

HENRY COOPER. I am an agent and lighterman
. On the 29th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Thames-street


, the carts were in great confusion and a great many people passing; I felt a person pressing against my back, I put my hand to my pocket, as I crossed Botolph-lane, and missed my handkerchief; the prisoner passed me - I told him he had got my handkerchief - He said he had not; a man said he had - He still denied it, and said a boy had got it, who ran up the lane, and if I would go with him to the public-house at the top of the lane, he would find the boy; I collared him and took him there, but found no boy; I took him to the beadle - He sent for a constable and gave him in charge; I felt about him, but could not find it; when he was with the constable, I saw something under his coat at the top by his back, I put my hand up and pulled my handkerchief out.

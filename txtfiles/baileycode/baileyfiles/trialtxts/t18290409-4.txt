            . I live in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road, opposite to Price. On the 28th of March, in consequence of information, I went into the street, and saw the prisoner, who appeared to be a bone-gatherer
; I followed him to the bottom of the street - I stopped him, and asked him if he had not got a pint pot in his basket; he denied it - I said, "If you will open it, I shall be convinced of it;" he then opened it, and there were two pots which Price claimed.

            . I keep the Bricklayers' Arms public-house
. Cousins brought the prisoner to me with these two pots, which have my name and sign on them; I have lost five dozen since Christmas.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

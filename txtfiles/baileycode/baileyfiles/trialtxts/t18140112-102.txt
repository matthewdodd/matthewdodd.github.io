            . I live at 67, Hoxton


. I lost my pig on the 3d of January. I kept the pig in a sty in a place next the kitchen. I missed my pig between eight and nine o'clock in the morning. It was safe in the sty on the over night. I saw my pig again at the office about ten o'clock the same day, and the prisoner. I have the pig here; I am sure it is my pig; it is worth twenty shillings. The back door had been forced open; the pig-sty was in the house; I had no yard to my house.
CHRISTOPHER JOSLING. I am a watchman at Hoxton. On the 3d of January, about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner passed me. I heard him say, be quiet. I thought he had somebody with him. He said, watchman, I have got a pig. I said, let me look at it; it is a pretty pig, how much did it cost. He said he had it given to him at Kingsland, and he had stopped until late. I told him I must take him and the pig to the watch-house: At the watch-house he told another story to the constable. The pig is here.
Prosecutor. I am sure it is my pig; I have had it three months.
Prisoner's Defence. I told the watchman I was going to take the pig to the watch-house. I picked the pig up in Kingsland road.

The prosecutor deposed, he lodged at the prisoner's mother's house at Ponder's-end; the things were missing; in about three weeks after the prisoner was taken, and upon being charged, confessed he had taken the things, that he had sold the waistcoat for 3 s. and the breeches and coat for 12 s.
Mr. Greenwood and Mr. White deposed to that of this confession.
The prisoner in his defence said, he found the things all in a bundle together near his mother's door.

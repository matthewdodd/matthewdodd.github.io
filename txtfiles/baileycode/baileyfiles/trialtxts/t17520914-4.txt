            . I am a goldsmith
 and live in St. James's market


, on the 24th of July I went out of town, and at my return I missed several pieces of plate out of my shew glass; I advertised them. On the Monday morning I had information about the prisoner, I took her up and had her before Mr. Fielding, she would not confess any thing, but was committed for farther Examination. Mr. Gunston a pawnbroker delivered to me this pepper box. [Produced in court and deposed to.]
Mr. Gunston. I am a pawnbroker and live in German street, the prisoner offered the pepper box to pledge at my shop the 25th of July, she wanted 27 s. on it. She told me there was nothing but pepper. I opened it and found oil and rotten stone, such as the silversmiths clean their plate with; then she opened the door and ran out. I knew her before.
Prisoner's Defence.
Mr. Nevil's own daughter gave me this pepper box to go and pawn for her.
Q. to Mr. Nevil. Have you a daughter?
Nevil. I have, she went away about a fortnight ago, she is about 15 years of age, I left her in my house and when I returned she was gone. The prisoner was her mantuamaker
, I never saw her in my house in my life. My maid ran away at the same time. I believe my daughter went away by the instigation of the prisoner.




               Guilty of felony only
            .

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner on the 15th of November, going towards the Liverpool-road - he passed me with a handkerchief; I thought I knew him before - I followed him, and when he got near the Blue Coat-boy, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "What have you got there?" he said, "A few candlesticks which I brought from my master's at Barnet, and I am going to take them to my mother;" I said, "What is the going to do with them?" he said he did not know - I took him to the office, and then found the prosecutor near the five mile stone at Highgate.

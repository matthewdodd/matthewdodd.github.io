            . I am a warehouseman
. On the 28th of April I was passing Bank-buildings, Cornhill - I heard some person call behind me, I turned, and saw the prisoner in custody; I immediately missed my handkerchief.
JOHN HOLLAND. I am street-keeper of St. Andrews, Holborn. On the 28th of April I saw the prisoner and two others - I followed them, and just at the beginning of Cornhill


 I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the witness' pocket; he gave it to one of his companions, who escaped; Perry has since identified one of the others, who is brought here on another charge.
Prisoner's Defence. I met a gentleman, who gave me a load to carry to the Bank; there was a waggon going by, and this gentleman said I had picked his pocket, but I had not.

SAMUEL HEINSON. I produce a record of the prisoner's former conviction; I was present at his trial - he is the same person (read).

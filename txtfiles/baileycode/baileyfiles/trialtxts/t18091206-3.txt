            . I am an apprentice to 
               
                  Christopher 
                  Nockells
               



            , on board the brig Monmouth; Mr. Nockells is the owner. On Sunday night, near a month ago Henderick Cornelius came from his own ship, the Hibernia, a collier; he came down in the steerage; I was asleep, he awoke me and asked me for a light, I told him if he felt on the table he would find a tinder box; he struck a light and went up, and then came down; 
               
                  William 
                  Gray
               



            , the other prisoner, he was mate of the Hibernia; I had seen them both before. 
               
                  William 
                  Gray
               



             came down and asked for the key of the hold of our ship, I told him I had not got the key; he awoke the other lad, he asked him for the key, his name is 
               
                  Robert 
                  Mallon
               



            ; Robert Mallon said I had the care of the keys, they were hanging up in the cabin. Gray said I must go and get them; I turned out of my hammock; he made me get the keys, I denied going to get them; he said he would pull me out, so I got out; I was afraid he would do some-to us if I did not get out; from that fear I went and got the key of the hold; he made me unlock the hold; he said our mate left him the command of the ship.
Q He was not in the care of the ship - A. No. I unlocked the door, he took a bucket and went down in the hold, he took a candle with him; I went down to see what they were after; both the prisoners went down and put a spike in a puncheon of rum, and took a small bucket of rum out of it, and went up upon deck and bottled it off in their own cabin; they carried it to the Hibernia; I went with them to the Hibernia; they came down again, they drawed another bucket; they took that up, locked the door, and gave me the key.

Q. How much was the amount of what they took. - A. They were two small buckets full, the buckets did not hold much.
Q. Then after taking this last bucket they gave you the key. - A. Yes; and they carried it on board the Hibernia, then I went to bed again, they made 
               
                  Robert 
                  Mallon
               



             watch on deck, on board our own ship to see if our mate was coming, they took him on board their own ship, they gave him four bottles, he brought them down in the steerage.
ROBERT MALLON. Q. How old are you. - A. I am just turned of fourteen.
Q. What are you at this time. - A. I am apprentice to

                  Nockells
               



            , the proprietor of the ship. I believe it was Sunday night, three weeks back, I was on board Mr. Nockell's ship, the Monmouth, Cornelius came down for a light, I was a bed, I knew him, he belonged to the Hibernia, I told him if he would feel upon the top of the chest, he would find a tinder box, he struck a light himself, he went upon deck and fetched Gray down. Gray asked my fellow apprentice for the key, he told him he had not got it, then they asked me for the key of the hold, I told them I had not got it, my fellow apprentice had got them. He made Sealey go and get them, he told him to unlock the door, he did; they went down in the hold and sent me upon deck to watch for fear our mate should come. I saw them come up with a bucket of rum, they went on board their own ship, they came down and got another bucket, and told me to come with them on board their ship, they gave me four bottles, two for Sealey and two for me. I took them on board, they told me I had no occasion to be afraid, they allowed three inches leakage in a cask, and we had a nice place below to keep it. On Monday morning, when the mate came on board, I told him that Gray and Cornelius were taking the rum on shore. The officers stopped it.

            . I am a Police officer. On the 13th of November, between seven and eight in the evening, I was on my duty, I stopped Cornelius and Gray in a ship's boat belonging to the Hibernia, I found a tin beer can in the middle part of the boat, and seven bottles with rum in each; I asked Cornelius what was in the can, he said beer, I found it contained rum, I took them to the office.

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I went to the ship Monmouth on the next morning, and from the information of Sealey, I gauged the cask of rum, the full contents of the cask would be 119 gallons, the ullage 115, there were four gallons deficient, the quantity taken was two gallons, there were two more deficient then was found on the prisoner: I 
               drew
             a sample and tried the strength with the hydrometer, I found that taken on the prisoner in strength exactly corresponded with what was left, I have no doubt but that it was from the same cask by the flavour and strength.

            . I am the owner of this vessel. The rum being laden in my ship, I am answerable for it, it was consigned to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Burton
               



             and Co. in Cork.
Gray's Defence. We lay alongside of this ship, this ship made use of our boat night and day, they were as likely to lay the rum in the boat as anybody else. I have been a sailor twenty years, and most of that time I served my country, under Lord Nelson, Collingwood and Gambier, as to the crime imputed to me, I am entirely ignorant of.
Cornelius's Defence. As we were pulling the boat he came alongside of us, and asked us what was in the boat, I told him I did not know whether it was beer or not.

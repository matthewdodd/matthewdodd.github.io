John Parkyn; 1 adze, value 3s. 6d., the goods of 



Joseph Carpenter; and 1 adze, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



James Lay.






JOHN PARKYN
. I live in Praed-street. I left my jack-plane, on the 30th of November, in a saw-pit at Mr. Nosworthy's—this is it—this adze belongs to Joseph Carpenter—it was in my care, and I left it with the plane—I do not know the prisoner.





JAMES LAY
. I lost this adze—I had left it in the same saw-pit, at Mr. Nosworthy's, at the back of Oxford-terrace—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he did not work there.





RICHARD ROADNIGHT
 (police-constable T 120.) I was on duty in Cambridge-terrace on the 30th of November, and took the prisoner with these things on him.
(Andrew Dubbs gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am eleven years old; I know the nature of an oath. I took Eliza Darnell out for a walk last Saturday - she is two years old; we were in 
               
                  Great 
                  Leonard-street
               



            , looking at some men tumbling, and hearing some music; I saw the prisoner come and take the necklace off Eliza's neck - I saw it in his hand and he ran away with it; I told Mr. Darnell - I am sure the prisoner is the boy.

            . I am an upholsterer, and live in Great Leonard-street. I was going along - the prisoner was pointed out to me; I went and took him - he said he had got nothing, but I found these beads in his right hand pocket.

            . I am the wife of John Darnell. I sent out Rosetta Sharp with my daughter, who had these beads round her neck - I am quite sure these are them.

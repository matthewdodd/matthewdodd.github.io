            . On the 28th of January, I was a seaman
, of the brig Shannon, which laid in the City Canal. I went to bed between eight and nine o'clock, in the forecastle, where my chest was; it contained seven half crowns among other money; the prisoner is a stranger - I heard a noise in the night, and my chest lid falling down, and sang out
"Who is there;" no answer was made. I jumped out of bed, and caught the prisoner going up the hatchway; I held him by the legs, and my shipmates secured him - I gave him to the watchman. I found my jacket on his back, and the handkerchief in the pocket.

            . I went on board the brig, and found the prisoner there; I found a jacket on his back, with five half-crowns in the pocket, and 6 d. and 3 1/2 d. in his other pocket - he said he had some companions near, and it would be a bad job for us if we detained him. I was obliged to tie his hands and legs.

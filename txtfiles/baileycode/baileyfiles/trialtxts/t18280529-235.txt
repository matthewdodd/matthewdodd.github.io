RICHARD HARRIS. I am a waterman
, and attend coaches
; I live in Bulstrode-mews, Marylebone-lane


. I had broken the glass of my watch, and put it into a box in my room: and on the 26th of May I opened the box, and missed the watch; I had kept the box locked, and had the key of it - the prisoner is my daughter; I met her in Bond-street on Friday last, and challenged her with it; she gave me up the duplicate of it - she is a bad girl, and comes home when she likes; I never allowed her to pawn that or anything else.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a watch pawned with me on the 27th of May by a female, in the name of Louisa Harris; I gave this duplicate for it; I cannot say that it was the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I asked him to let me in, and he would not; I did it for want - I had not had a bit of bread for three days.

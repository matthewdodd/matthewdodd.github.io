            . I keep the Angel and Trumpet public-house, at Stepney




. On the 21st of February, the prisoner came into my house, and asked for half a pint of porter; he sat, and drank his porter, warmed himself, and went out with the pots now in question. I followed him, overtook him, and found three pint pots and a quart pewter pot in his pockets. I have only one of them now; the others I have lost since. This is one of the pots I found upon him; it is mine.
Prisoner's Defence. Last sessions I was discharged here by proclamation; I hope you will think I have undergone punishment sufficient for this offence. I have served his Majesty on board a man-of-war. As I was passing along Whitechapel, an officer accosted me, and took me in custody, for the same charge for which I had been discharged last sessions.
Prosecutor. I was too late last sessions to find the bill; I was told, I must file the bill this sessions. I am sure he is the man.

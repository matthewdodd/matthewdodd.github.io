GEORGE HERBST HOWES. I am a linen-draper
, and live in the City-road


. About ten o'clock on the 24th of April this printed cotton hung in the lobby of my shop - I did not miss it till the officer came. I went to Worship-street next morning, where I saw it, and swore to my shop mark on it.
Prisoner. Q. Has not every shop in London the same mark? A. No, I suppose not; but I can swear to the writing.

            . On the 24th of April I saw the prisoner, in company with two other persons, walking by Mr. Howes' door - his companion went to the door, and took hold of the print; the prisoner took it, and put it into his apron. I went and took him with it.
Prisoner. Q. Did you make any alarm? A. No. I went and took you as you were going to Finsbury-market, about three minutes walk from the place; the other two went away in different directions - if I had made an alarm the prisoner might have escaped.

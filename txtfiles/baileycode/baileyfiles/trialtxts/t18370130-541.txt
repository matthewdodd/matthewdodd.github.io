ALDER HEFFILL
. I am in the employ of Elijah May and his partners, who are linen-drapers. I had seen the prisoner at the shop before—on the 12th of January she came to purchase a dress and other articles, which she paid for—she then asked to look at some thread-edging—a young man brought the box forward—after looking over them some little time, none of them would do, and after some time I saw her put a piece down between her shawl and her bosom—I went and sent a young man for a policeman—as she was going to leave the box, I stopped her, and said I was very sorry, but I was fearful she had taken a piece of thread-edging from the box—she said, "No, I have not; you can search me"—as she was saying that, one of the young men said, "There's the lace" and I saw the piece of thread-edging, which I saw her take from the box, on the floor—she got rid of it—I imagine it must have slipped down her clothes, and got out—she begged very hard to be released, but I said I was not at liberty to release her, as Mr. May was not at home—she stood at the top of the shop till Mr. May came in—this is the edging, it is on the card in the same shape as it was—I swear I saw her take it, and secrete it between her shawl and cloak, it is worth £1, there are forty-eight yards.

. I am a policeman. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction of felony, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

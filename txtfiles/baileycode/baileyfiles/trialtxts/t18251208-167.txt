                  STEPHENS
               




            . I live in Gray's-inn-lane, and am cheesemonger
. I owed Mr. Godfrey 3l. 2s. 6d., which I paid the prisoner for him on the 28th of November - to the best of my recollection there were three sovereigns - but I am sure I paid two.


                  THOMAS 
                  GODFREY
               



            . The prisoner was my servant
. I asked him for this 3l. 2s. 6d., but he never paid it me.
Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Godfrey allowed me credit for one thing under another. I offered him this money, and he said he would not have it, I should go to Hatton-garden. I sold the goods the week before, and was to receive the money on Monday. I went about the middle of the day - he asked if I had received it. I said I had, and would give it him then if he pleased.


                  THOMAS 
                  GODFREY
               



            . He did not offer me the money until the officer had him in custody - he said, before, that he had not received it.
Q. Was there a current account between you? A. No; he was a mere common servant, and had his regular wages.
Q. Had you any account with Mr. Stephens before this young man lived with you? A. Yes - my former servant had served him.
Prisoner to MR. STEPHENS. Q. Was not I the means of your being a customer to Mr. Godfrey? A. No; I have bought of Mr. Godfrey's man before I bought of you.
COURT. Q. To whom did you consider yourself to be indebted? A. To Mr. Godfrey only. I received no receipt, only a memorandum.

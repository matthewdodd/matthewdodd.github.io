            . I lost my purse about one in the middle of the day, on the 11th of January; I had been to carry a parcel, and was returning by the Globe Academy, and had occasion to stop to make water. While I was so employed, the middle prisoner came up to me and drew the bag out of my pocket. He is the younger Read; It was a leather bag, and the string of it was hanging out of my breeches pocket. He ran away; I ran after him; he ran into the field; I followed him, and the bigest Read knocked me down; the two Read's were together at first. I can't speak to the name of Downes; I did not see him. I never saw my bag or token again. I sell cakes, and was going to buy them with this token.

            . I live near Globe Academy, Bethnal-Green


. I saw the prosecutor and the two Read's come by the passage, as near one o'clock as possible. I did not know the Reads before; the elder 
               Read
             I swear to; but I don't swear to the little boy. I saw the elder Read knock down the prosecutor in the field; I saw the little one ran away at the same time.

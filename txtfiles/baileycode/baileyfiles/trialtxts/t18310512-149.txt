            . I am a grocer
, and live in Union-street, Old Artillery-ground


. On the 29th of April I was at the back of my shop, behind some shutters, through which there was an aperture, and I saw the back of a boy going out of the shop - I went out directly, and saw the prisoner and another boy; the prisoner had a drum of figs with him - I went after him, and took the figs; I then missed them from my shop - I had never seen him before; I do not know what had become of his companion.
Prisoner. I was coming down Union-street, inquiring for work, and a boy, rather taller than myself, said to me,"Hold this," I did so, and the gentleman came and took me. Witness. The other boy was about the same size as the prisoner, but he had a lighter coat on - I think this was the boy I saw in my shop: when I first saw him he was about forty or fifty yards from my house, and I took him about one hundred and fifty yards off.

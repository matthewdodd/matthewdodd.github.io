            . I am a haberdasher
, and live at Islington


. On the 7th of May about twelve o'clock the prisoner came in with another boy, who asked for some pins - I came forward suspecting them, and told the young man to take the lace box off the counter, as it stood near them; they said they only had 2 d., and left without buying any thing. I had put this lace in the box two days before, but did not miss it till the officers brought it.

            . I am Mr. Veall's servant. I was putting the laces in order when the boys came in. When I brought the pins the prisoners said they wanted some at 2 1/2 d., he stood nearest to the lace box; it is worth 34 s. 6 d.

            . I am a Revenue officer. On the 7th of April between one and two o'clock, I heard a cry of Stop thief! in Goswell-street; the prisoner and three others were running away, and was crying Stop thief! himself - but I stopped him as he was being pursued. I found the lace in his hat which Mr. Veall claimed.

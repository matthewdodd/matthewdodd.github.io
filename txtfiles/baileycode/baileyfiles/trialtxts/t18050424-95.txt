             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden; I was standing at the Hat and Tun door, in Hatton-wall; On the 18th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner and a boy past me, the prisoner had got an old basket on his back, it was as much as he could carry; I suspected that it was stolen property; I followed him and at the bottom of Vine-street, Saffron-hill, he stopped at an old iron shop.
Q. Had this boy any thing with him? - A. No.
Q. Who kept the old iron shop? - A. One March; he mounted the steps of the door and threw it down and run away; I rather suspected that he saw me standing at the top of the hill; I imagine that the boy told him I was following him; I immediately laid hold of the boy and took the property.
Q. What did the bag contain? - A. A great quantity of iron old and new; I took the boy to the office; and the boy was committed to the House of Correction; and by the boy I found out that he worked for Mr. Bailey; and where he lived; I went and took him up immediately.
Q. When you took the prisoner up are you sure he is the man that run away? - A. I have no doubt, I asked him how he came to run away; he said, he run home on purpose to shut his house up.
Q. Where was his house? - A. No. 2, in Weston-park, Lincolns Inn-fields; not having an opportunity to take him before the Magistrate, I took him to the House of Correction, I also informed Mr. Bailey the next morning what I had done; I took Mr. Bailey with me and searched the house, and Mr. Bailey owned the iron and tools; I brought it away; I had two hampers full; Mr. Bailey saw the iron at the Office, that the prisoner threw down at the old iron-shop door.
Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing to the boy before he run away? - A. I did, but I do not know what it was, he run pretty fast, he had like to have knocked down two or three people as he was running away.
Q. When you went to his house, was there any forge there? - A. There was, and a great many tools which Mr. Bailey owned, and there was a stove there, in an unfinished state.
Q. Did you know him before? - A. Never to my knowledge. I produce the property.

             sworn. - I am a smith, I work for Mr. Bailey; I know the tools to be Mr. Bailey's property. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's defence. I keep a little smith's shop, and have done for seven years past; sometimes I have a man to work for me; I buy old iron; I buy half an hundred weight or an hundred; if it is too heavy for me, I sell it again; I left work at seven o'clock and went with this iron, with my little boy; I said to my wife, my love, I will leave Ted there to take the money, I will not stay, she being ill, and I had not fastened the house up; I went down to Mutton-hill, to the iron shop, and left the boy there; I returned home to my house again directly, my wife being ill at home; I could not think where the boy staid; by and by, after nine o'clock, a person came to our door and knocked; I said, who is there; I opened the door, and this officer came in; he said, are you the person that belongs to this house; I said, I am; did you leave this boy with the iron; where did you get it; I said, I have got more; he said you must go to the Justice, and let us know how you got it; I shewed him all down the cellar; said he, you must go to the Justice; I went to Hatton-garden, and he took me into a public-house; then, by and by, he said, the Justice was gone home; he took me to Clerkenwell for that night, till the next day; at twelve o'clock he came up to me again, and took me to the office, and when I found what he had brought there, I saw enough to frighten five hundred people; I said, what did you bring this property here for, this property I have had by me this seven years; they took every thing from me but my anvil and my forge; if masters knew a man worked for himself they would not employ him; I make stove-grates for one particular gentleman.
Prosecutor. He has not had the chain and pulley above a week.
The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.

WILLIAM ROBERT WOOGATE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of May, 1 watch, value 1l. 10s.; 1 watch-guard, value 5s.; and 1 penknife, value 6d.; the goods of 




John Francis Matthews, and another.






JOHN FRANCIS MATTHEWS
. I am a pawnbroker and silversmith, in partnership with Benjamin Matthews, in Liquorpond-street. The prisoner was in our employ as salesman—I lost a watch—the prisoner's

brother gave me some information which induced me look for it—the prisoner left us last Monday, of his own accord—I had no suspicion of him at that time.





HENRY MARK WOODGATE
. I am a tailor in Westminster-bridge-road. The prisoner is my son—I heard he was in possession of a watch—I searched the privy, but could not find it there—I and his brother questioned him very strongly that we had heard he had got a watch—he denied it very strongly—at last his younger brother said he had thrown it down the privy—we could not find it there—he showed us where it was, and we found it in a hat-box under the show-board—he told us he took it out of his master's window—he denied having the chain for a long time, but at last produced it—he has been a very bad boy.





WILLIAM MURRAY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody last Wednesday morning—the watch was given to me at the station-house by the father and son together—I questioned the prisoner, and he said his master had beat him, and that was the reason he left—I said, "Was that for taking the watch?" he said, "No, it was before I took the watch"—I said, "Where did you take the watch from?"—he said, "From the window"—he also acknowledged taking a knife from the counter—I did not threaten him or make him any promise—I had heard he had the watch in his possession, and knew he was sleeping about from his father's house when he might have been at home.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—Recommended to mercy.

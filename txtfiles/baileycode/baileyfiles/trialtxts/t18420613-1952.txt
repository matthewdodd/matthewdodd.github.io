SARAH ELIZABETH DEANE
. On Friday, the 10th of June, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to my house to inquire for lodgings—I am sure it was her—my watch hung on the mantel-piece—the prisoner requested some water, and I desired her to follow me to get it—after she was gone I missed the watch—this now produced is it.





HENRY MALLAM
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker. On the 10th of Jane, this watch was pawned for 8s., I believe by the prisoner, about five o'clock.

Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the watch, nor this witness; I never was in the pawnbroker's shop; I do not know where it is; I was at my aunt's from ten o'clock in the morning, till six in the evening,

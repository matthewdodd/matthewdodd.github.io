            . I am a carpenter. On the 21st of June, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I was going to work, and saw the three prisoners with a bag, in Well-street, Hackney; from the bulk of it I suspected them - Taylor and Mason were lifting the bag on Stitchbourne's shoulder. I followed them about a hundred yards, they then parted; Stitchbourne went to the right-hand with the copper. I met a neighbour, we followed him, and found he had put his load down to rest - he said his father had sent him with the copper. I got a constable, and gave him in charge. We went and took the other prisoners about a quarter of a mile off. I am sure they are the boys.

            . I followed the prisoners, and found the copper and lead in the bag, which Stitchbourne had; he said he brought it from Hommerton, but did not know the name of the street - he could give no account of it. I saw the two other prisoners coming through another way to meet Stitchbourne - they were secured. We took them to a public-house - Taylor had no shoes on; when they parted he took a pair of shoes from Stitchbourne.

            . I am a constable. I was fetched, and took Stitchbourne in charge. I took the other two, who were waiting in the street. In the way to the watch-house, Taylor and Mason said the bag belonged to them all. On searching Stitchbourne, I found a piece of a sink in his pocket. He pulled his shoes off, and gave them to Taylor, as he said they were his, but he had borrowed them. I took Stitchbourne to the premises, and asked him how they got in? he showed me, and said they went in at eleven o'clock, and meant to have had two coppers. I fitted the lead to the place.

                  Scott 
               



            . I live in lower East Smithfield, I am a lighterman


, in partnership


 with 
               
                  Robert 
                  Newcomb 
               



             and 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Turner 
               



            ; on Saturday the second of this instant, I heard Harding was taken up for stealing some ropes; I having lost some, went and charged an officer with him, and carried him before Sir 
               
                  Robert 
                  Darling 
               



            ; I charged him with cutting off head-fasts belonging to a lighter of our's lying at St. Catherine's



; he told me before the Justice he did do it; I desired he would tell me where he had sold them; he told us he had sold them at a house in St. Catheri ne's-lane, but could not recollect the name of the person till after some time, then he said it was to 
               
                  William 
                  Nightingale 
               



            ; we got a warrant, the prisoner went and shewed us the house, we found a man that answered to that name; the prisoner pointed to a room, and said the ropes were there; the man gave us a candle, we went and looked, and found several head-fasts that had been taken from lighters; I cannot pretend to say that any one of them are mine, but my servants that worked the lighter say they are; we took the prisoners before the Justice again, and that man; the man said he was not the master of the house, that the house belonged to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Wharr 
               



            ; then we had another warrant, and went and took her up; the man was discharged, and she was committed, but afterwards admitted to bail.


                  John 
                  Moon 
               



            . I am a waterman. I was upon the top of St. Catherine's stairs, and saw the prisoner Harding in the craft, and cut part of the head fasts away, on the first of this month, about nine or ten at night; there was another person on the stairs, he asked the prisoner what he was about; he said he wanted a place to lie down in to sleep; he took some head-fasts away; I did not know but that he might be about a job, as he goes some times with lighters; I hearing Mr. Scott had lost some rope the next day, I went and told him.


                  Thomas 
                  Fragley 
               



            . I believe these ropes to be the property of my masters, the prosecutors; I navigate the lighter, and know there are five head-fasts missing at different times; I missed three that morning that Moon came and told us of this; then I went and took the prisoner in a public-house, he owned they were at the woman's house that is at the bar; I went there with my master and found some, these that I have here; (two produced,) I know them to be my master's property; I made the clinches, and whipped the ends of them with my own hands; them I swear positively to.


                  Henry 
                  Ford 
               



            . I am servant to the prosecutors, I really believe these are my masters property; I remember three of them being missing, and we found these the next day.
Prosecutor. I have no other evidence against the woman than Harding; she owned she bought them of the prisoner, she said as old stuff, and gave a market price for them; two of them are bran new; a new one stands me in about 7 or 8 s. Harding said she gave 16 d. halfpenny for two of them, and 18 d. for the other.
Harding's defence.
I did not cut the rope away, I never had none of them.
Wharr's defence.
I did not know that they were stole, I thought they were no better than old rope to make paper of; I have been but nine months in the business, I had put these among my old ropes.
Prosecutor. She never denied the buying them.
She called eight witnesses, who gave an account she had dealt in rags for paper-making, and had but lately dealt in old rope, of which brown paper is made, and they believed she was ignorant as to the goodness or value of it, and all gave her a good character.

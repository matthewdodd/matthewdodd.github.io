RICHARD COLLINGS
. I am a tailor, and five in Little Ormond-street, Queensquare. On the evening of the 16th of November the prisoner and another came to my shop—the other had a bag—the prisoner wanted to know the price of a black waistcoat, as his mother was dead, and he pointed to some crape on his hat—he wanted it by Monday, and asked what I should charge if he found the stuff—I told him, and be said be would call again on Monday morning—they then went away, and the prisoner carried the bag—the moment they were gone I missed my great coat, which bad been lying on a sofa all day—I went out directly and gave information to the police—I saw the coat three weeks after in Pocock's possession—this it—(looking at it)—the prisoner never came again.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was it the man who was with the prisoner that ordered the waistcoat? A. Yes, but the prisoner was more talkative than the other—I had never seen them before—my little girl opened the door to them—she could not swear to the prisoner before the Justice—she did not say he was not the person—the coat is my own make.





THOMAS POCOCK
 (police-sergeant F 13.) On Thursday evening, the 5th of December, I saw the prisoner, in company with another person—he had this coat on—I took him to the station-house, and told him the charge—he said it was his own coat, he had bought it for 1l., of a Jew, in Monmouth-street, who he met in the street, with a bag on his back—he could not tell who he was—I also found a coral necklace on him.

Cross-examined. Q. Was there a little girl before the Justice? A. There was, about the necklace—she could not identify the prisoner, it being dusk.

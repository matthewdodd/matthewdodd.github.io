WILLIAM SEYMOUR. On the 24th of August I was in Fleet-street


, about two o'clock in the day - I felt some person at my pocket; I turned suddenly, and a person said I had had my pocket picked; I saw a person drop my handkerchief - the prisoner was standing with his back towards me; I seized him - he broke from me, and ran up the street, but was pursued, and taken; I took up the handkerchief, and gave it to the officer.

            . I was in Fleet-street - I saw the prisoner and two others; the prisoner took the handkerchief from the prosecutor, and put it behind him for his companions to take, but they saw that I saw them, and would not take it - it fell down.

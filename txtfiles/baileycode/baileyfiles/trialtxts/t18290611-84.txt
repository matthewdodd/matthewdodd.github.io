I let a ready-furnished lodging to the prisoner for about four months; he left without giving notice - he owed me 1l. 5s.: I missed this property from his room, and have never got it since; he has a wife, I believe; they lived together, and went away together - they took the key, and left the room locked; I did not see him again till the 17th of April.
WILLIAM KING. I apprehended the prisoner, in contest with the prosecutor, for which he was tried yesterday, on another indictment; I took him to the watch-house.

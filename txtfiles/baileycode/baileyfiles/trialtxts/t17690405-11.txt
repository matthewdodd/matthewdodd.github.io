            . I am a grocer


, and live in Giltspur-street, and am in partnership with John and 
               
                  William 
                  Champion 
               



            . On the 22d of Feb. one of my partners told me we had been robbed. I went to view the warehouse, and found two rails sawed out, and that night I set a watch, but without any success. Then I applied to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and ordered a reward of five guineas for a discovery. After that one Ackerley was taken and turned evidence. I know we lost five baskets of raisins.


                  David 
                  Ackerley 
               



            . On Tuesday the 27th of Feb. about two in the morning, I and 
               
                  John 
                  Davis 
               



             went together; he sawed two of the bars across and took them out, and then took five baskets of raisins out. That was at a warehouse in Giltspur-street. We took them to his lodging in Jacob's Court, Cow-Cross. Two of them were disposed of to Mrs. Lamb, and the other were disposed of without my knowledge. I was taken up the Sunday after the fact, which was on Tuesday morning.
Q. What are you by trade?
Ackerley. I am a perukemaker. This was the effect of intoxication with liquor. We were drinking together, and he proposed it to me.
Q. What business is the prisoner?
Ackerley. He worked in the crane at the keys.
Thomas Street. I keep the tap in New Prison, I was informed where the evidence was, and went and apprehended him. After that I found this basket in Davis's lodging in Jacob's Court, Cow-Cross. After that we took Davis in Long-lane, Smithfield, by the direction of the evidence. (Produced in court.)
Fleming. I do not swear to the basket, but have great reason to believe it is ours.

                  Champion 
               



            . There were twenty baskets with raisins weighed the day before; they were put under the window where the bars were found cut. The next day I counted them, and there were no more than fifteen of them. Among the twenty I had observed one of the baskets to be of a different kind, and this is that very basket. I mentioned that at seeing it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all of the young man that is evidence against me. When I went into the room where the woman lived that I did cohabit with, I found him in bed with her. As to the raisins, I never saw them in my life. I was at Woolwich from the 26th of Feb. till I was taken up. I had a shilling a day allowed me to work the lighter up.

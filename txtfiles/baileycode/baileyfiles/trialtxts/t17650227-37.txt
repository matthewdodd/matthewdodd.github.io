            . On the 19th of February we miss'd some coals from a lighter at Scotland Yard dock


: we had reason to suspect the prisoners; I was informed the prisoners were seen to throw some out into a barge that lay by; I went and found the quantity mentioned in the cabin; I charged the prisoners with taking them; they confessed they had taken them, and that they were my property.

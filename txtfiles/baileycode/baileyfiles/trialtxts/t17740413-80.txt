            . I am a silk weaver
, and live in Queen-street


; I deal in linen check; on the 11th of March last, I lost six yards of this check; 
               
                  Daniel
                   Boyer
               



             told me about three days after the fact, that he saw the prisoner take it; I took her up and she confessed it.

                   Boyer
               



            . I am apprentice to a carpenter; I was at work for Mr. Taylor; some check lay on the counter where I was at work; I saw the prisoner come and take a piece of check and put it in her apron, and go down into the kitchen with it; I presently after told Mr. Taylor's clerk of it, and he told Mr. Taylor.

            . I am a constable: Mr. Taylor sent for me, and charged the prisoner with robbing him of this check; she confessed it, and said she had given it to a woman; 
               
                  Ann
                   Blanchard
               



             coming to Taylor's house, I suspected it might be at her house; I went there, and there I found it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I ask my master pardon; it is the first time I ever did such a thing.
The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character.




               Guilty of stealing to the value of 10 d.

Benjamin Duffield, from his person.






BENJAMIN DUFFIELD
. I live in York-street, London-road. On 14th June, between three and four o'clock, I met the prisoner in Gravel-lane—I knew him, and asked him to share a pot of beer with me—I said, I had some recollection of him, and asked if his name was not Brown—he said it was—there was another with him—we had the beer—I treated them—we came out and walked towards home, and when we had got two or three hundred yards, I took out my money to look at it, and there was a sovereign and some silver—the prisoner seized it and said he would go home with me, and when I got to the corner I turned round, and they were both gone.





JOHN MILLS
 (policeman, M 171). On 14th June, about five o'clock, the prisoner walked over to me out of Ewer-street, followed by Duffield, and said, "This roan has accused me of stealing money"—I had heard previously that there bad been a man robbed of a sovereign—Duffield said he did, he had robbed him of a sovereign, and he was positive he was the man—I took him.

Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came and said, "I believe your name is Brown;" I said it was not; he charged me with robbing him of a sovereign; I said I had not, and walked up to the policeman—I never saw him before.





BENJAMIN DUFFIELD

re-examined. I was sober—I bad seen him about ten years before, not since—I know him well—he worked with my father.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

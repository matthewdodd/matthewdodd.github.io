             . The prisoner was my servant
 ; I live at the Hospital-gate, Smithfield


 ; and keep a coffee-house . I lost a silver spoon and two handkerchiefs , on the 6th or 7th of July. The prisoner went away the day they were missing.
Q. Are you a married woman?
Brook. I am . My husband's name is John Brook. A neighbour of mine-informed me where the prisoner was to be found. I went and took him up, and he owned he took the things mentioned out of my bar, and had pawn'd the handkerchief for 1 s. 6 d. He own'd he had sold the silver spoon to a silver-smith ; I went there, and they owned to the buying it, and said it was cut to pieces, and I could not see it.

            . I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; he owned to me he took two handkerchiefs and a table-spoon ; that he pawned one of the handkerchiefs in Bride-lane, ( producing one deposed to by the prosecutrix ). We went to the silver-smith where he said he had sold the spoon broke in two, next door to the Cross-keys tavern , Holborn. The woman remembered she bought such. a spoon of the prisoner, but it was cut in pieces, saying he had two tea-spoons and a pair of buttons in exchange, which he acknowledged was truth. The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

                  SARAH 
                  TODD
               



            . I live at No. 3, Little Bell Court, Gray's-inn-lane, in the parish of St. Andrews, Holborn


. Mrs. Henry keeps the house; she does not live in the house; her niece sleeps there. I have the lower room. I am an unfortunate girl. On the 20th of March, about half past eleven o'clock at night, I went to the top of the court; there are two ways to come into the court; I was gone about five minutes, and when I returned, I saw a light in my room; I asked them, what they did there.
Q. Who was there - A. There were five men in my room; they made no reply. 
               
                  John 
                  Crawley
               



             was turning up the bed, to put it in a blanket; the blanket laid alongside; he immediately laid hold of my arms, and dashed me down by the foot of the bed; he said, you b - y w - e, if you make a noise, I will cut your throat; I holloed out murder as loud as I could; Murray in the mean time was taking down the curtains, and somebody took the tea-tray, but I cannot say who it was; they heard a footstep coming; they blowed out the candle; it was Mrs. Henry; she came to the door with a candle in her hand; then four of the men rushed open the door. 
               
                  John 
                  Crawley
               



             was in the middle of the room, I said, for God's sake, give me my curtains.
Q. How did they get into your room - A. I left the door upon the catch, any body might open it outside.

Q. 
            Did you know these men before - A. John Crawley I have seen several times; I am sure Murray was one of them.
Q. Did they take your curtains away - A. Yes; they were not worth much; in fact they belonged to Mrs. Henry.
Q. What became of these men - A. They went away, and I bolted the street door. The tea-tray is not mine; it is a ready furnished lodging.

Q. 
            Did Crawley visit you - A. Never; I was always frightened at him: I never lived with him, nor had any thing to do with him.
MRS. HENRY. I went into the room when I heard the cry of murder; I live next door; I went with the candle in my hand. I only know 
               
                  John 
                  Crawley
               



            .
Q. How many persons were there in Mrs. Todd's apartment - A. Five. I saw several men there; Crawley was in the middle of the room; I left them all at the door and ran into my house; I was frightened very much.


                  JOHN 
                  PRICE
               



            . I am a constable. Between twelve and one 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Harvey
               



             came to me and said for God's sake come, there will be murder done, and when I came I saw Murray coming from the house, No. 4, he was obliged to pass No. 4, when he came from No. 3.
Q. Did you see him come out of the house - 
               A. 
            No; I saw him turning the corner of the door; I do not know which house he came out of. After I had taken him to the watchhouse Mrs. Henry delivered to me the curtains.


                  WILLIAM 
                  JUSTICE
               



            . I am a patrol. On Tuesday night, the 20th of March, I was informed there, was a a disturbance in Bell-court; I immediately went there, I saw five men coming out of the court; I saw Murray, he had a scratch on the side of his face; Crawley was the last one that went down the steps, they all five went into Fox-court, and then they told me they would rip my b - y guts out; I drew my cutlass and called a watchman to my assistance; I went after them, they all escaped; they said they could beat fifteen or twenty watchmen at any time; Price came to me, we met Weston and Murray at the corner of the court; I secured Murray, we took him to the watchhouse; I am sure Murray is one of the five; I thought Crawley was one of them, but I cannot swear to him. Crawley bears an infamous name; the neighbourhood is all in terror of him.
GEORGE HUTT. I apprehended Crawley last Wednesday night at the Sugur Loaf in King-street, Drury-lane, he made great resistance when I took him; he said he supposed I wanted him for that bawdy house row.
Q. to Mrs. Henry. How did you get these things - A. The men made their escape, and after this was over some men came in the court with a woman, they had the curtains and tea tray, the woman said, I advised these men to bring the curtains back, as they belong to you; the men said they would not deliver them unless I would give them some gin; I told them I had no gin, and made haste in doors, they threw the things in after me.
Crawley's Defence. I had been drinking with this woman all the afternoon; I had lived with her before I went to the East Indies; the first night I came home Isaw her in Holborn, she said she was glad to see me, and we drank together, and on this very afternoon she spoke to me, and we went into the White Hart and drank together.
Sarah Todd. That is not true.
Murray's Defence. I work for Mr. Phipps at Rotherhithe. I was sent to get plaster; I came to Brooks' market to find a young man of the name of Buckel; I went into the White Hart; I saw this man, we went in the Jolly Butchers; I fell asleep in the tap-room. I was in Henry's house, but in this house I was not at all.


                  JANE 
                  TAYLOR
               



            . I am an unfortunate girl. I live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. I have seen both the prisoners three times by going to see Stoker in Newgate. On last Friday night, as I was going up Holborn, I met Sarah Todd, I asked her what she meaned to do with the young men, she said if Weston would give her a sum of money she would go over the water into Dover-street and stay there till the trials were over.
Q. Was any body present - A. A young woman; she is in the same line as me.


                  ANN 
                  ROBERTS
               



            . I went to Newgate to see Stoker; I was walking down Holborn with this young woman last Friday, I heard the same as she has told you.
Q. to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Todd
               



            . Do you know either of these young women - A. I do not. I was at home that night.

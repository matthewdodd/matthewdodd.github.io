JOHN ZUGG
 and 




JOHN LESLIE
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of a man unknown, from his person; and that Zugg had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM WEST
 (police-constable F 106.) About half-past eleven o'clock at night, on the 21st of March, I was in Brydges-street—I saw the two prisoners standing opposite the entrance of the theatre—I saw a gentleman come out of the theatre, and they closed up behind him—Zugg took this handkerchief from his pocket—I secured Zugg, and took the handkerchief from his breeches' pocket—Leslie ran away, and the gentleman got away—I have not been able to find out his name.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. The theatre was not over? A. No—I was about two yards from them when Zugg took the handkerchief.

COURT. Q. Had you seen them together before? A. Yes, many a time—I knew them to be associates—I had seen them together for about ten minutes that night.





JOHN BATEMAN
 (police'constable F 99.) I produce a certificate of Zugg's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 6th May, 1845, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.

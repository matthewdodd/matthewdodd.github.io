             Dawson, Esq., of Upper Grosvenor-street


. On Monday week, about half-past three o'clock, I heard the area gate open; I watched the gate, and saw the prisoner go out - I went into the kitchen, and asked the cook if any one had been there on business - she said No; I then got my hat, and pursued the prisoner - I asked what business she had down the area in Upper Grosvenor-street; she said she had not been there; I raised her shawl, and found these shoes, which had been taken from the servants' hall- they are my master's.
Prisoner. I did it through distress.

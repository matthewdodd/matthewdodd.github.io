            . I was in Guildhall


 about one o'clock on Saturday the 1st of October; the prisoner was standing by me; on a sudden I felt my pocket book move from my pocket; I turned about and saw the prisoner with the book in his hand, which he put under his coat; I got hold of his hand with the book in it, and he dropped the book; when I laid hold of his hand he asked what was the matter; I said he had taken my book out of my pocket; I called a constable and charged him with the prisoner.

The pocket book was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.

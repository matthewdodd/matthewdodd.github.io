            . I live in Upper Thames-street. On the 16th August, about nine o'clock at night, I was in Broad-court, Drury-lane


; I felt a jerk at my coat-pocket, turned round and collared the prisoner, Thompson, immediately at my elbow, the other prisoner was about one yardoff; I missed my handkerchief and insisted on searching him, he said he was very willing to be searched, which caused me to suspect the other prisoner had the handkerchief; the constable stopped him-nobody was near enough to take it but the prisoner.
JOHN NEWMAN. I am a constable. I was in Broadcourt, and heard Mr. Routh charge the prisoners with taking his handkerchief. He had Thompson in custody.

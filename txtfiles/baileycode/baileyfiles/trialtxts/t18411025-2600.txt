CHARLES WARD
. I am foreman to Mrs. Hannah Winter, of Hounds-ditch. I had this copper-pan in her shop on the morning of the 9th of October—I missed it.





JOSEPH HARGRAVE
. I am apprentice to Mr. Farnsby, a copper-smith, in Gunn-square, Houndsditch. I was going down Houndsditch, and saw the prisoners waiting outside the prosecutrix's window—I passed by, turned my head round, and saw a third person coming but with a pan on his head—I turned back, and went into the shop—I asked the apprentice if he had sold a pan—I came out, and kept Coultass in sight—he dropped the pan—he then ran off—the other one escaped—the prisoners were both together when the third person came out with the pan.

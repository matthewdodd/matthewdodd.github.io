EDWARD HENAGAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of January, 4 handkerchiefs, value 18s. 10d., the goods of 




Sarah Ann Wilson and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN DURAND
. I am in the service of Sarah Ann Wilson and Charlotte Selina Wilson; they keep a shop in Clerkenwell. On the 21st of January the prisoner came to the shop—he said he wished to see some silk handkerchiefs—I showed him three or four, and I saw his left hand pressing something into his pocket—I asked if any of those handkerchiefs would suit him—he said "No"—I brought him some more—he said none of them would do, he wanted black and white stripes, at about 4s., 6d., or 5s. 6d.—I told him we had not the exact pattern he wanted—he said, "Show me some others," which I did—I again saw him putting his hand

to his pocket—I asked if he would fix on any one—he said "Yes," and fixed on one at 3s. 10d.—he left 1s. on it, and was about to go—I went by him to the door, and said, "I think you have got some of our handkerchiefs"—he said he had not—I pulled one of these out of his pocket—I put my hand in again, and found these other three.





JOSEPH BURKETT
 (police-constable G 50.) I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchiefs.





THOMAS EAVES
 (City police-constable, No. 303.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

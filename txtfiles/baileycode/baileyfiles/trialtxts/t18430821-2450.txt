JOSEPH JOHNSON
 and 




GEORGE WATTS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
12th of August, 8 pairs of boots, value 1l., the goods of 



Eliza Jay; and that Johnson had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN NEWTON
. I live in Ward's-place, Islington. About half-past nine o'clock, on Saturday night, the 12th of August, I saw Johnson cut a bundle of Adelaide boots from Mrs. Jay's door, and give them to Watts—he ran away with them—I am sure these are the two men—I informed the police.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You knew Watts by his flannel jacket, did not you? A. Yes, and by his face—I knew him before—he was standing at the top of Ward's-place—I was in the road, just opposite him, walking up and down the Lower-road—the boots were found in Ward's-place—I did not see them picked up.





HENRY PARKER
. I live in Ward's-place. On Saturday night I saw Watts run down the place, with a good many pairs of boots under his arm—I found one pair near to where he ran—I gave them to my mother.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Newton? A. No—there were several persons running down Ward's-place—I know Newton very well—the prisoners did not live in Ward's-place—I swear that Watts was the person.





ANN PARKER
. My son Henry gave me this pair of boots that night—I took them back to Mrs. Jay's.





ELIZA JAY
. bout half-past nine o'clock I heard the string of the bundle of boots cut—I went to the door, and missed them—I believe this to be one of the pairs.





THOMAS TYLER
 (police-constable N 275.) I produce a certificate of Johnson's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

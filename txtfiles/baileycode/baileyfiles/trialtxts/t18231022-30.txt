            . I am a tallow-chandler
. On the 27th of September, I missed this bundle of paper from a loft at the top of my house; I never saw the prisoner in the house - he was brought to me by Page. I frequently heard a noise over my head at night, but never thought the loft was being robbed.

            . I am a constable of Cripplegate. On the 27th of September, Gibbs sent for me, and said,
"This boy, who only came out of prison yesterday, has been robbing again;" he gave charge of him - this was in his mother's room. I went into the garret with him, and saw this paper strewed about the room, and asked where he got it; he pointed to the window, and said,
"I got it from the top of the house." Davis lives five doors from Gibbs's, where the prisoner's father lodges. He said he got out of Gibbs's window, and got the paper off the top of the houses. I got on the roof; he followed me, and pointing to Davis's loft, said,
"I got it out of that loft."
(Property produced and sworn to.)



               GUILTY
            . Aged 10.

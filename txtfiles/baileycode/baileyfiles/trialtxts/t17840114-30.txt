I am sister to the last witness, and we were looking out of the window, and I saw the two men pass down the street, and about ten minutes after they returned back again; the prisoner at the bar was one of the men, they had two very large bundles, one in a red handkerchief, and the other in a yellow one; the prisoner had a yellow handkerchief under his arm, they walked very quick along, and as they came back again the prisoner at the bar stopped at the publick house door and tied his garter up; they had not the bundles with them then, I saw no more of them, I have seen the prisoner several times, I know him by sight, I took the more particular notice of him because it was Sunday, it was about a quarter before four o'clock to the best of my knowledge, and it being in sermon time, my sister said to me, look at them two men what bundles they have got; the next morning I mentioned this; the prisoner was apprehended about a fortnight after, I saw him at the Rotation Office, and I knew him then, I charged him with it there.

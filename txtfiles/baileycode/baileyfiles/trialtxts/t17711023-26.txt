; the prisoner worked for me and lodged in my house; he left his lodgings on the 15th of August last. I missed two dimity waistcoats on the 20th; I suspected him, and got a search warrant, but I could not find him; about a fortnight, after I missed four yards of Manchester velvet, and a yard and three eighths of broad cloth. I then made fresh enquiry after him; and I took him myself in Brook's Mews; he confessed soon after that he had stolen my goods, and said he would make me satisfaction. Two of the waistcoats were at the White-Horse lane, at Mr. Bradley's; he went with the constable and me to Mr. Bradley's.

            . I am a pawn broker. I had this waistcoat pledged with me on the 27th of August, I believe, by the prisoner, but cannot be positive,
- Bradley. About two months ago I bought two white waistcoats of a man, who is, I believe, the prisoner at the bar.

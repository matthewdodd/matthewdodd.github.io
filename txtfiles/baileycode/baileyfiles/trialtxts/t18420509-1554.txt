WILLIAM WHITE
 (City police-constable, No. 112.) On the eve of Good Friday, the 24th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I was on duty in Silver-street, and saw the prisoner in company with Godwin, who was in his uniform as a policeman—they were pacing to and fro in Silver-street, for about half-an-hour—they then separated—Godwin placed himself in a dark door-way, and the prisoner placed himself on the opposite side—as soon as they separated, I went to the prisoner, and asked him what he was waiting for—he made no answer—I asked him if he belonged

to the force, or whether he was on special duty—he said "You ask me a very bold question, you are too intelligent; however, if you think any thing, there is my mate's number, that is quite enough for you," pointing to Godwin, who was right opposite—I left him, and went over to Godwin, and asked him if there was any thing amiss—he said, "No, nothing very particular"—I asked him if he knew any thing of the man on the opposite side, loitering about there—he said, "Oh, yes, I know him very well, it is all right"—I left and went down my beat, about half way down Wood-street, when I saw Mrs. Lewis apparently in Godwin's custody, and saw the prisoner following about twenty yards behind—as the prisoner passed me he said, "He ought to have had both of us to help him to take her," meaning he ought to have had both me and him to help him—he gave me no reason for it—about a quarter of an hour after this, I was standing a few yards from Mrs. Lewis's door, and saw the prisoner and Godwin come back in great speed—both went up to Mrs. Lewis's door—one of them opened it with a key, from what I could hear rattling, and both went into the house—I went to the door, and Godwin brought a candle and candlestick to the door, and asked me to give him a light—I gave him one with my lantern—the prisoner at the same time requested me to keep pretty handy as my services might shortly be required—I kept about for five or ten minutes, and saw nothing of them—I then went round my beat—I saw Mrs. Lewis again, about two o'clock with Godwin and her bail Mr. Cox—she went to her house—she came-out about a quarter of an hour after and said she had been robbed during her absence—I and my sergeant went into her house—she showed us the place, which was in a very disturbed state, and things pulled out of the drawers.

Prisoner. Q. You say I was loitering about Silver-street with Godwin, about half-past nine o'clock? A. Tea—Mrs. Lewis's shop was closed when I first saw you there—I know nothing about its being a joke when you said you ought to have had two policemen to take the old woman—you said he might want me, and told me to keep pretty handy—I cannot swear how long you were inside—I went away—the door was shut—I did not try it, but I heard it bang to close—I heard the latch catch—I was standing there ten minutes—I did not notice you with a bundle that night—I did not see the little man that was brought with you to the Mansion-house that night—if you had carried a bundle that night to Mr. Jocelyn's I might or I might not have seen you—my beat forms a square—I dare say you took care I should not—I heard Mrs. Lewis say at Godwin's trial that she had lost a shawl—I cannot say whether he was indicted for stealing a shawl—I heard it mentioned—I heard her say so—I first heard of Mrs. Jocelyn on the 14th or 15th of April—I went to several public-houses to see if I could get information of you and Godwin having been there that night—I went to Mrs. Jocelyn's after Godwin's trial, and asked her if she had seen a man of your description there that night—she said, "Don't say any more, I can give you a description of him"—I cannot say whether it was the 15th—it was in the middle of April—I asked if she had seen a man with a macintosh on with a bundle—she said she had seen a man with a macintosh on with a velvet-collar and a bundle—she said he had a bundle—she did not say whether he came in or not with it, and what made her take particular notice was, the man carried it with his left arm—she said nothing more—she said a little man came in with him—she said you put the bundle under the settle—that the little man came in first, looked about, and said it was all right—a bundle

was handed from somebody outside the door in to you, and you put it down very softly, as if there was something very brittle in it—I do not know what made her remember it—I went of my own accord—I do not remember her saying any thing more than I have stated—she did not tell me the exact words that took place between you and the little man.





SARAH LEWIS
. I am a widow, and live at No. 19, Silver-street, in the parish of St. Olave. On Thursday evening, the 24th of March, soon after seven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me for half-a-pound of list-binding, and a pennyworth of string—they came to 2 1/2 d.,—I was to get them ready against he came again—he asked me what time I shut up my shop—I told him at ten—he said he should not be back at that time, it must be a little after ten—he went away—he had been several times to my shop before, both him and his wife—I never saw him after, till I saw him at the Mansion-house on this charge—Godwin came in that night a little after ten, after the shop was closed—I left the house that night in his custody, but saw nothing of the prisoner or any other person—after going to different station-houses, I got back to my house at two in the morning—when I left the house I had the keys of my street-door, shop door, bed-room, and back-parlour with me—all those doors were shut and fastened—I parted with the keys to Godwin, and had left in my bed room a time-piece, a dark bottle-green cloak with a very large cape to it, and four strings round the front—I missed them, and missed from the back-parlour a pair of sheets, six yards of calico, a shawl, and apron—that was the sitting-room, the room behind the shop—the things were in a drawer—the shawl was a very dark one, with a very small border to it—it struck two o'clock as I was coming home—on going into the house I found the drawers in the lower room turned all about, and disturbed, and then missed these articles—I gave an alarm that the house was robbed—I have never seen the property again.

Prisoner. Q. You recollect me buying string of you? A. Yes—you asked me what time I shut up my shop, and told me you would be back at ten o'clock or soon after—you and your wife had been in the habit of purchasing articles there—your wife has not been there since—she did not fetch the twine and binding next morning, Mr. Potts fetched it—when you came that night I saw no bundle in your hand—if you had one, of course I should have been able to have seen it—I cannot say that you placed any thing in the shop—I might have informed you I should not be in bed till half-past ten—when Godwin knocked at the door, I supposed it was you come back for the binding and twine—I observed nothing more than usual in your conduct—I cannot say how you were dressed—when I was discharged, Mr. Waller ordered my keys to be given to me—the robbery was done while I was at the station, in Moor-lane, between half-past ten and half-past eleven—I received the keys from the inspector on duty, and found my place locked up as I left it—Godwin took my keys and 2s.—I gave them to him in Wood-street, out of my pocket—I did not see you with him—the shawl was taken out of the last drawer but one—I do not know whether Godwin was indicted for stealing the shawl—I will swear I missed it when I missed my other things—it was a very dark shawl—I dare say I might discern the colour of it by candle light, at a little distance—I should say the border of it is about as wide as the length of my finger—about this length—it was a dark border, and you know it was—I will

swear my shawl is not mislaid among my other things at this present moment—I did not bear of Mrs. Jocelyn till the charge was brought against you, and you were brought up at the Mansion-house—I live close by her—my son and Mr. White were ordered to go round to the public-houses to know if any body went in that night—Jocelyn lives at the corner of Basinghall-street—I occupy the lower part of the house and one room up stairs—it is Mr. Allwright's house—he lives there.

MR. RYLAND. Q. Did you give the keys up to Godwin before you were at the first station-house? A. Yes, almost immediately I left the house in his custody—I got them back when I went to the station-house in Tower-street—it was about half-past eleven when I was taken there from Moor-lane—he was going to give them, I believe, to Waller, who ordered him to give them to me—it was then getting on for twelve o'clock, I dare say—Godwin had been absent from me during that time—he left me standing in Margaret-street, nearly ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I was carried to Tower-street station—he had the keys then—I gave him the keys, as he asked if I had got any friends—I said yes, but it was a wrong time of night to go, but I had a son, if he would go to him; and when he left me in the station-house in Moor-lane I expected he was gone to give them to my son—he told me he would take them—I gave him the keys to take to him—he told me I should be searched, and I gave him my keys and two shillings to take to my son, and he told me he would go and fetch him, but he did not.

Prisoner. Q. Was your husband ever in trouble for receiving stolen property? A. Never—he was locked up one night, but did not receive it.

MR. GURNEY. Q. Your husband has been dead some time? A. Three years last March.





MARY JOCELYN
. I am the wife of George Jocelyn, who keeps the Red Lion public-house, Basinghall-street. On the evening before Good Friday I remember two persons coming into my house whose appearance attracted my attention—the prisoner Reynolds came in, looked round, and said, "It is all right," to a little man who was close behind him—the little man named Potts, had a bundle on his arm, and gave it into the prisoner's hand—it was a good sized bundle tied up in a dark shawl with a narrow border—I should say not wider than this—(shewing her finger)—I cannot say what was in it—they laid it down with great care, as I thought, as if there was something brittle in it—they did not sit down—the prisoner turned to the little man and asked what he would have—he said a little drop of beer—he had half a pint, and the prisoner had three-halfpennyworth of gin, which he drank with his left hand—he never moved his right hand at all—they stopped a very few minutes—he said to the little man that he was very tired—the little man asked him to sit down—he said no, he was on very unpleasant business to-day, and he was afraid he must have some more, and would make the best of his way home, as he had some things to sell in the morning—the prisoner went out at the London-wall door, carrying the bundle in his left hand—he took it off the seat in front of the bar, and went away with it—the little man opened the door for him.

Prisoner. Q. You take in the daily newspapers? A. We have the Morning Advertiser—I do not read it once a month—I heard of this robbery before the policeman came, but I knew nothing about you—when he came to inquire, I said you had been there with a dark-green Macintosh

with a velvet collar—the policeman first came to me about the middle of last month—he merely asked me if I remembered any thing that happened on the 24th of March—I said, "That was Thursday fortnight"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Let me alone"—I went into my bar parlour, and asked myself a few questions—I went to look at my book, and I had good reason to remember that night, for that evening somebody went into my tap-room and stole three brass knobs off a kitchen range—that was the day before Good Friday—when I came out I told him I recollected you and a little man—he said, "What sort of dress"—I described it—he said, "Have you any objection to come up and see if it is the same man?"—I said, "Not the least"—I came and picked you out of a score of people—I noticed your taking the bundle with your left hand—I saw how it was put down—I suspected you of doing wrong, you looked about and seemed to have your eye over every body—you looked with suspicion at every body, and I had suspicion of you from your manner—my husband has kept the house seventeen years—the little man had a very shabby hat and dress—I cannot say what was in the bundle—I did not see the time-piece sticking out of it.





FREDERICK RUSSELL
. I am a policeman. I was at Godwin's trial—at that time nothing was known of the prisoner with any certainty—I remember his name being mentioned in the course of the trial—I knew him, and in consequence of what passed I and other policemen endeavoured to find him—I succeeded in finding him out on the 14th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, at No. 8, Collyer-place, Collyer-street, Pentonville, in a house by himself—there was nothing but an old chair in the house—I know his wife, she lives at No. 1, Paradise-street, King's-cross—I went to her house once to look for him, but could not find him—she was living there—when I found him in the empty house, I told him I wanted him for a robbery of Mrs. Lewis, in Silver-street, which Godwin was convicted of—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him it was for stealing a time-piece and cloak along with Godwin—he said what was Godwin to him—he had put Godwin into a good thing, if Godwin bad known how to make it out—making it out that Godwin did not know how to go on with it—he said he did not deny but what he was with Godwin at Mrs. Lewis's that evening, but Godwin had taken away the time-piece and cloak, what was that to him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you give this same evidence at the Mansion-house as you have now? A. Very near, I believe—(looking at his deposition)—this is my hand writing—it was read over to me, and I signed it—(read)—the part referred to was as follows:—"He said he did not know any thing of it, and as to Godwin, what was it to him if Godwin had taken the things he added, he did not deny he was with Godwin, but said Godwin had taken the things away.") A. He said the cloak and time piece—I mentioned the cloak and time-piece to him—he said Godwin had taken away the cloak and time-piece himself, and what was that to him, and that he had put Godwin into a good thing, but that he did not know how to do it, or some thing—I believe I mentioned this to the solicitor—I believe my evidence was taken shorter at the Mansion-house than I gave it—I am sure I mentioned it to Mr. Martin this, but my deposition was taken in another room.

MR. RYLAND. Q. Do you believe you stated before the Magistrate all you have stated here to-night? A. I have—he said positively that God


win had taken away the time-piece and dock, and that he had put him into a good thing, or words to that effect.

Q. How came you not to mention this to the Magistrate?A. My deposition was taken by the solicitor—my deposition was taken before I was examined by the Magistrate, and read over in the Magistrate's pretence, after I gave it to the clerk—I said nothing to the Magistrate except acknowledging my signature—I was not examined in the bearing of the Magistrate; but Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Jocelyn, and White, were.

Prisoner. Q. Was your examination read over to you in he presence of Mr. Alderman Wilson? A. Yes—the prisoner heard it read over.

COURT. Q. How came you not to point out that these two material facts were left out?A. I did not know but what it was put in at the time—I am quite certain he used these expressions—I stated them to Mr. Harris, who took the examination in the outer room—I was not examined before the Magistrate, only it was read over in his presence.

Q. The prisoner had no means of knowing you had mentioned his saying he had put Godwin into a good thing, &c, &c.? A. No, nor that he took away the time-piece and cloak, except by the word "things" in the deposition.





JAMES SAMUEL HBATHER
. I am ward-beadle of Cripplegate Within. Silver-street is in that ward, and in the parish of St. Olave, Silver-street.

Prisoner. The little man was held to bail to be called here; he would prove whether he brought me the bundle or not; they have locked him up in solitary confinement in Giltspur-street, and have not brought him forward; they dare not bring him forward, it is shameful.





FREDERICK RUSSELL

re-examined. I apprehended the little man named Potts, having information of his being in the prisoner's company that night, and he is the man who attended on the prisoner at the empty house—he was committed for bail, not as a witness—I believe he is in the Compter—be was not examined with the prisoner—the prisoner said he could bring witnesses to prove he was not there that night—Potts was charged with having something to do with this offence.

Prisoner's Defence. I went that night to Mrs. Lewis's house, and bought some binding and twine; I had been in the habit of purchasing there; I asked what time she would shut up; she said about ten o'clock, but should not be in bed before half-past ten; I went there about ten minutes after ten, and saw Godwin, the policeman, take her to the station; I followed her to Moor-lane, waited till he came out, and asked him what she was taken up for; he said for receiving stolen metal; I told him I bought some binding and twine there; he said he was going to the place, and would give it to me; he asked me to go over the way to get a light, but I said, "Here is a policeman coming, get a light of him," which be did; I said to the policeman, "You had better stop, he may want you;" Godwin tried to open the shop-door, but could not; I said, "Never mind, I will send my wife for it in the morning," which I did; Mrs. Jocelyn was never heard of till the prosecutrix's son went with the policeman to the house; she goes into her little back-parlour and states the time of my coming and the words I used: is it likely I should go to her house to say what she states? I declare solemnly I never was in the house, and never saw the little man in my life, and he positively denies bringing me the bundle; he was locked up because he would not say he brought it to me, as they wished; if he did, must he not have received it knowing

it to have been stolen, or have stolen it? he was examined behind my back, while I was locked up; it was read over in my presence; Russell' deposition was read over to him, and he was very particularly asked if he had anything farther to add; he said no, and signed his name; his object in his evidence to-day is to convict me, but can you believe him after he swore different at the Mansion-house? It has been said I went there and put some metal on the woman's premises, then sent Godwin there to get it, merely to entrap him, to transport him; now it is proved I did not bring any bundle in, or she must have seen it, which fully proves the falsehood of the report; the trial is to convict me, to get a commutation of his sentence, but the prosecutrix proves he robbed her on the way to the station; I wish to call Leigh Wood, the City policeman.





FREDERICK RUSSELL

re-examined. I did not notice the omission in my deposition at the time it was read over to me.





WILLIAM LEIGH WOOD
. I am a City policeman. On the 29th of March I recollect seeing the prisoner in Fenchurch-street between eight and nine o'clock at night—I was in the tap, at the Corn-market, afterwards—several persons looked in and nodded to me—I nodded in return—I cannot say the prisoner was one of them—I never saw him in Godwin's company—I never knew him by the name of Reynolds—I was sent with a police-sergeant to find his residence, but could not find it—I went there afterwards but did not find any of Mrs. Lewis's property there.

Prisoner. I have been employed by sergeant Hambling, who is now in Newgate; I have been too much mixed up with the police to have a character; I have served them faithfully, and because I have exposed some of their tricks I am brought here to-day; Godwin never knew my name or residence, till he was informed of it at the station.
(The prisoner called a witness by the name of Mary James, who was examined to prove the time the prisoner came home on the night in question, but after her examination she admitted herself to be his wife; and as such her evidence was not admissible.)





JOSHUA POTTS
. I did not carry a bundle for the prisoner on the 24th of March, nor see him that night—I have been three weeks in Giltspur-street Compter, and have had no conversation with my friends for a fortnight—I have fetched binding and twine for the prisoner from Mrs. Lewis's almost ever since—I have dealt there eleven or twelve years—it does not come to above 2d. or 3 1/2 d. at a time—I never heard him say anything about taking anything from Mrs. Lewis—I know Russell—he asked if I was in the prisoner's company that night—I said not—I did not carry a bundle into Mrs. Jocelyn's that night—I never saw her—I go to Mrs. Lewis's four or five times a week—she spoke about the robbery, but did not allude to the prisoner—I recollect her saying the prisoner's wife had been for some things, but whether it was on the Saturday or not I cannot say.

MRS. JOCELYN
re-examined. This witness is the short man of whom I spoke, as sure as I am a woman—he is the short man who handed the prisoner the shawl containing something at my house—I cannot positively swear whether I had ever seen him before or not, but I am positive he is the man.





CHARLES WALLER
. I am inspector of the police. I cannot say one way or the other whether Godwin knew the prisoner's name or residence—I asked him who his informant was—he said he did not know his name, nor where he lived, but he was known to the police.

COURT. Q. Was that when Godwin was charged with making a false

charge, and was asked who informed him there was anything wrong in Mrs. Lewis's house? A. Yes.

MRS. LEWIS
re-examined. Potts used to come backward and forward for string and binding—I know nothing of his character.

Transported for Fifteen Years.

             , from the Person of Symon Thompson, on the 2nd Instant.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That he went to drink at the Castle in Rotten-Row in Old-Street


, and falling asleep, had his Pocket pick'd by the Prisoner, who took his Money and Purse, which were afterwards found upon her, the Purse he knew to be his own, there not being its Fellow, for being industrious, he made it out of an old Cabbage-Net, the Piece of Cabbage-Net was produc'd in Court, and the Prosecutor swore that was his Purse, which was taken out of his Pocket, and found upon the Prisoner.
It appeared by other Evidences, that the Pocket was found upon her, and that then she confess'd the Fact.
The Prisoner told a long Tale in her Defence, of the Prosecutor's buying a Bunch of Carrots of her, she being a Green-Grocer
, and that then he perswaded her to a Publick House, and wanted some Meat to his carrots, that he pull'd out his Cabbage Net, and gave it her, bidding her go Home, and he would come to her, and do so and so, that she very innocently went Home with it, and presently after she found he had fallen asleep, and awaking, the Fit had left him, and then he chang'd his Purpose, and had her apprehended, tho when the Constable came up Stairs with his Staff, she thought he was come full of Love, and ran to the Stair Head, with open Arms, to receive him, but found herself disappointed; but this Story smelt so strong of Newgate's Invention, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

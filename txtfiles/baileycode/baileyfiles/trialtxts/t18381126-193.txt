Joseph Butt.






JOSEPH BUTT
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Little Turnstile. I missed a pair of shoes on the 1st of November—these are mine—(looking at them)—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I ran as far as Bedford-street, where the shoes were picked up, and we desisted from the chase—I did not see the prisoner.





HANNAH DODD
. I live in Little Turnstile, just opposite the prosecutor's. Between eight and nine o'clock that morning I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner take the shoes from the prosecutor's door—I am sure he is the man.





WILLIAM MANTON
. I took the prisoner from information I received, in Lincoln's Inn-Fields, about half-past two o'clock on the 2nd of November. I took him to the prosecutor's, and Mrs. Dodd identified him as the man.

Prisoner. I did not see her till I got to the office.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a seaman
. The prisoner came out of the London-docks


, with a pipe in his hand - he passed me, came back, threw his pipe down, pushed me, and took my watch out of my pocket - he got away with it.

            . I was in the Red Lion, public-house, Nightingale-lane, I saw the prisoner there, he followed me and the prosecutor out, and by the London-docks he turned back; I saw him push the prosecutor down and snatch his watch - I followed and secured him, and with assistance, took the watch from him. Two or three came up and said, "Knock him down." I was obliged to let him go - he was taken next day. I am sure he is the man, he was quite sober.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a patrol. About half-past ten o'clock, I was informed of the robbery, and had a description of the man, I took him in half-an-hour; he said the man had got his watch again and it was nothing to me - he was sober.
Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor. The man said at the office that somebody else took it.

            . I am a publican
, and live at the King's Arms in Bishopsgate Church Yard


. On the 8th of April I was gone out a little way, when I came home, the prisoner was in my house, in the possession of a constable. She was charged with stealing a pint pewter pot, my property.
Mrs. Marshall. I am wife to the prosecutor. The woman at the bar came into our house on the 8th of April, the moment she came in she took a pewter pint pot from off a bench, and put it under her apron; she turned about, and saw me, then she called for a half-penny worth of gin. I asked her what she had under her apron. I turned it back, and there was one of my pint pots in her hand; she let it fall, and ran out. I caught hold of her cloak, it gave way; she fell down in the passage, and another pint pot fell from her. She got up and away she ran, and I after her, and called Stop thief! she was stopped, and by shaking her about, the rest of the pots mentioned in the indictment were found upon her. Two pint pots, a quart pot, and a half-pint pot, besides my own; one of them had a string tied to the handle. By the names on the pots we let the owners know. (The pots produced in Court.)

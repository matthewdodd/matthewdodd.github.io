HENRY COPE
. I am a labourer, and live in Laleham parish, in Middle sex—it is my dwelling-house. On the 11th of July I left my house about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and left my wife at home—the watch was in my bed-room on the ground floor—about ten o'clock I received in formation—my wife had left the house after me, and came to bring me my breakfast—we went home and found the window, which I had left fastened and secure, was open, and a pane of glass broken, and the door had been forced back with the poker and tongs—this is my watch—it is worth 21s., and was taken from the house.





JOHN WAKE
. I heard that this house had been broken open, and went across the meads between eleven and twelve o'clock—I overtook the pri soner at the Nelson public-house, Old Windsor, and took him into custody, and found this watch in his pocket—he said he had received it from the person who broke into the house—that he was outside and received it from him.

Prisoner's Defence. I and another man were going to work, and he gave me the watch at Old Windsor.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—

 , the 26th of August
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prosecutor and Prisoner were Journeymen 
Taylors


 and Bedfellows, Lodgers in Mr. Bibb's House; and that the Prisoner coming in, while the Prosecutor was gone to work, open'd the Box, and took the Money. The Fact being plainly prov'd by the Purse in which the Money was, and part of the Money being found upon the Prisoner, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

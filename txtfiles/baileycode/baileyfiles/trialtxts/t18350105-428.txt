 for stealing, on the

Eleanor Dickens.






GEORGE OLIVER
. I am in the service of Eleanor Dickens, a widow, who lives near Portman-square. The prisoner came to our house to assist in cleaning knives—I knew him for about two months—on the 1st of January I heard about a spoon being found at the pawnbroker's—I looked over the plate, and missed a dessert spoon—the prisoner is very poor—he has no friends but an uncle, who can do nothing for him.





JAMES PALMER
. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner offered me this spoon—wishing to know if it was silver, I asked where he got it—he said he had found it in Oxford-street—I sent for the policeman, and while the lad was gone for him the prisoner ran off, but I knew where he lived, and sent the officer for him.

Prisoner. He wanted to buy it of me. Witness. No; he did not offer it for sale.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

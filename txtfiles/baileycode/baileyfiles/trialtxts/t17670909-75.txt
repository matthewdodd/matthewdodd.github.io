            . I am a weaver
 and warehouse-man
 in Newgate-street



; I was informed there were goods selling cheaper than they could be made, and they were suspected to be my goods; this was the latter end of July, or the beginning of August; I was shewed the shop in West-street, near Spitalfields market, the man's name Simpson; there I saw some worsted quality binding; I bought six yards, at a halfpenny a yard; upon the corner of a shelf I saw three large rolls, about eight or nine inches over; I desired to look at them; he reached them down; I was confident they were my goods; he told me if I had come two hours sooner, I should have seen the man he bought them of, but he had bought a great many at various times of Mrs. Jones; these people appearing very open and honest, they told me they bought them at a farthing a yard, and sold them at a halfpenny, the common price is a penny; I wanted to find out the thief; I said if they would assist me, no harm should come to them; they told me, the man called himself the maker, and lived in Petticoat-lane; I enquired, and found this Simpson bore a good character; I employ a great many work people, more than I know their names; I enquired of my people, if they knew one Mrs. Jones; they said, she is an impudent creature, and lives in Grub-street; I went to Simpson's house, and his wife went with me, and we went and found Mrs. Jones; we took her to Wood-street Compter; she confessed she had taken bindings of mine, and carried them to Holythorne to sell. It appears by my books she did work for me.

                  Simpson 
               



            . I live in a sale-shop in Spital-fields; I bought some pieces of binding of Holythorne on a Saturday, about two months ago; I bought of him three times in all, for 18 d. a piece, and sold them again at a halfpenny a yard.
Prosecutor. They will vary half a yard; they are betwixt 35 and 36 yards in length; they are all alike in point of length.
Simpson. Here is a parcel I bought of Jones for the same price; (six rolls produced in court.)
Prosecutor. These are my property, I found these at Simpson's; after that, Simpson told me of twelve more that he bought of Holythorne, which were put to dye; Simpson went with me to Montague-close, to a dyer's, where we found them, and brought them away; (produced and deposed to.)
Simpson. Holythorne told me he was the maker of them, and he cut them out of the loom, being a poor man, to make a little money; I bought all these pieces of him.

             his wife confirmed the account he had given.

            . I had a little business with Mr. Simpson; while I was there, Mr. Holythorne came in with a few bindings; Mr. Simpson scrupled them; he said he was the real maker, and was forced to cut them out of the loom for ready money; I bought a piece of Mr. Simpson.
Prosecutor. Holythorne declared before my Lord Mayor, he had these goods of Mrs. Jones; he said he had had but a very little profit in the selling them; that he sold them for Mrs. Jones, and kept something for his trouble; after that, I was told by the keeper of the Compter, if I would go to Mrs. Jones, she would tell me all; I went to her; she told me she had stole these goods out of my warehouse as often as she could, at four or five pieces at a time, when my men's backs were turned, and that she had a pocket for that purpose; and by Holythorne's and her account, I suppose; I have lost an hundred pieces; Holythorne owned he had sold six pieces to a chandler's shop in the Land of Promise
Jones's defence.
When they took me they found nothing upon me; when I was in the Compter, he said if I would confess the truth, he would leave me to God and the mercy of the Jury; I told him I sold sixteen pieces to Holythorne, and never saw a halfpenny piece for them.

Holythorne's defence.
About three months ago, Mrs. Jones came to me, and said she could put a shilling in my pocket; She said they were bindings for women's wear, and said they belonged to one Williams, that was arrested and in the Marshalsea prison; I knowing her many years, took them, and sold them for her; I had no more than 2 s. 8 1/2 d. for all I sold.
For Holythorne.

            . I am sister to the prisoner; I have known 
               
                  Jones
               


             a great many years; about a week before Easter, she came with several pieces of binding in her lap, and said she wanted to dispose of them for one Williams, who was in prison, starving; I think I can swear I saw nine or ten pieces; she came several times.

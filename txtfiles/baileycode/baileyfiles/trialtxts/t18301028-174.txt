            . I am a gold-beater
. On the 23rd of October I heard that the scullery was open, and these things were missing; I went out, and told the Policeman - the serjeant came to me; I went to the station-house, and found the prisoner there with this cheese and candles, part of what I had missed; he said he had found them.

THOMAS WOOLCOTT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
10th of February, 9 yards of printed cotton, value 5s. 6d.; the goods of 



Frederick Jones, his master.






FREDERICK JONES
. I keep a linen-draper's shop in Peerless-place, City; the prisoner was my foreman. On the 10th of February, I procured two officers to watch him at he went out at night—he usually left at nine o'clock—the officers brought him back with this property—he said it was not his, and that he took it without my sanction.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have known him a good many years? A. About four or five years—I had been a fellow-shopman with him—he has a wife and four children—we alto found a print dress at his house.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-sergeant D 20.) I watched the prisoner about nine o'clock that evening; asked if his name was Woolcott, and whether he was in the employ of Mr. Jones—he said, "Yes"—I said I had information that he had robbed his master—he said he never robbed him in his life—I took him back, and found this print between his trowsers and shirt.





HENRY REDMAN
. I am a policeman—Brannan has stated what is correct.
(Benjamin Abley, a publican, in Brick-lane, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

EDWARD ROBERTS. I am a carpenter
. I was at work in Tavistock square


, at a new house - I left my tools locked up in a chest, at half-past five o'clock, on the 5th of November - a labourer, who was there, was to lock the room. On the 6th, at half-past six, I found my tool chest open, and the tools taken out - some were left about the room - the articles stated in the indictment were gone.

            . I am a private watchman. I was in this house, on the 5th of November, about half-past five; and about two o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise inside - I went in, and saw the prisoner stooping upon the chest - I asked him what brought him there; he said he wanted some of his own tools, and said to me "You thief, do you want to rob this place?" I took hold of the door, and he took hold of it, and pulled it open - he took hold of a saw, and attempted to strike me with it - I defended myself with a stick, and in the struggle I lost one of my teeth.

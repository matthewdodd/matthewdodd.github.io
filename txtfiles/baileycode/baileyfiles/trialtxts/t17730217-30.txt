            . I am shop-man to Mr. Jones, No. 370, Oxford-road. On the 2d of February

             gave me an information that the prisoner had taken the cloth from a bulk; I followed her; when I got within three yards of her she dropped it; I never lost sight of her from the time I saw her first. I secured her and took her before a justice who committed her.
Q. Are you sure that is Mr. Jones's cloth?
Mead. Yes; I know it exceeding well; it came in the night before the woman took it; it has the shop mark upon it: I did not miss it till the young man came in and said it was gone; I had seen it about half an hour before.

            . I saw the prisoner take the cloth from Mr. Jones's door; she put it in her apron and ran away; I never lost sight of her till Mr. Mead secured her.
Prisoner's Defence.
Coming by this shop I saw a mob; I looked down and saw a piece of cloth upon the ground.
She called two witnesses who gave her a good character.

            . I live within a few doors of Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Hull
               



            , a hatter
. On the 11th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, with two other boys, near his house, and I watched them - I was on the opposite side of the way; I saw one of them (not the prisoner) reach into Mr. Hull's shop, and take the cap off a book; he put it on the prisoner's head, and they all ran off together- the prisoner had nothing on his head before; I secured him almost immediately, within twenty yards.

            , I keep the shop: this cap is mine - I know nothing of the prisoner.

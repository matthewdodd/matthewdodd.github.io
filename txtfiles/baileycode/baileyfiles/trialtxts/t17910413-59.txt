                   HOLMES
               



             sworn.
I rent a farm at Hanworth



; I lost these articles, some out of a bed-chamber, some out of one parlour, and some from another parlour, both below stairs; the money was in my bedchamber, close by my bedside, lost out of a box, which was locked, on the 30th of March, between seven and eight in the evening; my wife and I had been out a walking between two and three in the afternoon, and left 
               
                  Thomas
                   Russell
               



             to take care of my house; he had been in my service about a month; his business was to clean knives, shoes, or any thing he was ordered to do
: in the evening, when we came home, my wife missed the things; one of the witnesses has got the things now; I saw them the day after I missed them, in Mr. Moss's hands, in my own house.


                  MARY
                   HOLMES
               



             sworn.
I am the wife of the last witness: I went out with my husband, and had seen the box and the things safe just before I went out; the box was left locked; I was out about two or three hours; when I returned, I went up stairs, and went to my box, and found it broke open; when I went to unlock it, I found it was forced, broke open by violence; there had been taken out of a purse in it four guineas and a half in gold, and thirteen shillings in silver; nothing else was taken out of the box; the other articles were all above stairs, which were lost, and which are mentioned in the indictment; they were all put in a drawer, in a dressing-table,except the stockings, breeches, and buckles, which were all in another drawer, left unlocked; and I believe the muslin neckcloth was in a foul-clothes basket.
When had you last seen the contents of the purse? - On Sunday, as this happened on a Wednesday: I cannot say justly when I saw the things in the parlour, as it is a drawer I did not frequent much; we have got the breeches, the stockings, and the silver stock-buckle, and the silver knee-buckle, the four guineas and a half in gold, the thirteen shillings, and the watch-chain, I believe it is all back, the three gold rings, the jewel-case, and the neckcloth;

                   MOSS
               



             sworn.
I am park-keeper to the Duke of St. Alban's; I went up to Mr. Holmes's on the 31st of March; they told me they had been robbed; Mr. Holmes and I, after some talk which would be the best way to find out the robbery, went down stairs, and called the boy into the house (
               
                  Thomas
                   Russell
               



            ), and Mr. Holmes says to him, I have great reason to suspect you to be the person that hath robbed me; if you will give up my property, before I go and fetch a constable, I will let you go about your business: after that, the boy told me that he had hid them in the ground, and that they were towards the stable-door; and there we found them; the boy kicked them out of the ground along the foot-path, on Mr. Holmes's premises, about ten or twelve yards from the house; we found these two parcels of lead, one in each hole; in one parcel, three guineas, three gold rings, and a silver stock-buckle; and in the other parcel, the metal watch-chain, a guinea and a half, and thirteen shillings; these things were found by the direction of that boy.

             sworn.
I am a journeyman smith: I know no more than Mr. Moss has said; I was in the house while Mr. Moss and the boy went out.

                   Oakes
               



             brought these pair of cotton stockings to me at my master's shop, and a muslin neckcloth; I do not know the day; he desired me to take care of them for him; Oakes works for the same master as I do, Mr. Seward, a blacksmith and farrier; he said his mother gave him the stockings; I have kept them ever since.
(The stockings and neckcloth deposed to.)
The gold ear-rings, valued at 21 s. the silver stock-buckle, worth 2 s. 6 d. watch-chain, worth 6 d. two pair of stockings, worth 5 s. a muslin neckcloth, worth 2 s. 6 d.
PRISONER RUSSELL.
I never saw this man before, nor was ever acquainted with him.
PRISONER OAKES.
I found these things going across the common.
Mr. Stiles gave him a good character.

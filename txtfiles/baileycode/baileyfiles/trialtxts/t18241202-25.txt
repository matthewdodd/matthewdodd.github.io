JOHN THOMAS BARBER BEAUMONT, ESQ. I live in Regent-street. On the 26th of November, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was passing Fullwood's-rents, Holborn


 - I had a silk handkerchief in my pocket; I had used it shortly before. I felt it being drawn out of my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner near me, apparently in the act of gathering it up in his hand; I collared him, and said, "You scoundrel, you have my handkerchief;" he said, "I have not;" I said I was sure he had. At that time two other men, who were in company with him, came at my back, and pressed against me, but as they saw me determined, they ran away; the prisoner said "I suppose those men have stolen it;" I said I was sure he had it, as he had not had time to pass it to any others - I then pulled his hand and his coat, and wondered where it could be, when a gentleman, who came up, found it on the ground, at his feet. I have not the least doubt of his being the person who took it.
Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. There were two other persons close by the gentleman at the time.

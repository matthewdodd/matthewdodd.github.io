WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of May, 1 coat, value 1l.; the goods of 



Allen Rider; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS TRAXTER
. I am an officer of St. Bartholomew the Great. On the 24th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was at the I gate in Long-lane, and saw the prisoner in company with another lad—the other left him, crossed over the way, and went down a turning—the prisoner passed me with a coat under his arm—I seized him—he dropped the coat, and ran up Long-lane—I took up the coat, and called to a police-man to stop him—he turned him back, and at last took him.





WILLIAM COOK
. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner near a wagon in Long-lane, about four o'clock—I afterwards saw Traxter stop him—he immediately ran up towards me—he turned back, and ran into the market—I pursued and took him—I afterwards found the owner of the coat—I had seen him leave the wagon with it.





ALLEN RIDER
. I am in the employ of Mr. Boyd, a farmer. This is my coat—I left it in a van, in Long-lane, about half-past four o'clock that morning.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to Smithfield-market to take my cousin tome meat; as I returned the officer took me, and said I had stolen a coat.





JOSEPH GREENGRASS
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present when he was tried, and know him to be the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Yean.

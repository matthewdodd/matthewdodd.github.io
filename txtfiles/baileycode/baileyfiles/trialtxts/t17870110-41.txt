I keep a stall
 the corner of Little Turn-stile, Holborn


, to mend shoes; about a quarter after seven on Saturday morning, the 30th of December, I went to my stall, and found the door open; I saw a man sit in the stall, and a man standing on the outside, about three yards from it; I desired the man outside to assist me, he would not; I pulled open the door of the stall, and saw the prisoner sitting on my seat with the shoes in his lap; he looked at me; says I, you villain, what do you do here; he came out with the things in his lap, and was making off; I seized him by the collar; the word was spoken, go and do him: immediately the prisoner struck with main force, cut my lip in half, and knocked three of my teeth out; I was all over blood; I let him go for fear of being murdered; I followed him at a yard and a half distance; and in Stonecutter's-alley he turned round and said, you b - gg - r, if you follow me, I will do you; and I caught him; he was never out of my sight.
Prisoner. I found the shoes; I did not strike him.

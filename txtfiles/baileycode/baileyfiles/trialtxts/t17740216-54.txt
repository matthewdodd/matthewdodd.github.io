            . I am master of a ship; a quantity of lead was taken from the ship; I saw it there on Thursday; it was wanting on Friday; it was found by the other witness; it corresponded with the place from whence the lead was taken. (Some lead produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I am a watchman: on Thursday night between eleven and twelve, I saw the prisoner with the lead; I suspected him; I seized his bundle, and found it to be lead.

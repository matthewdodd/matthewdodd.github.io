            . I live in Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury


: I am a bricklayer
; the prisoner is a labourer
; I employed him two years. On the night between the 21st and 22d of last month, I missed about 300 lb. weight of lead; it was found concealed on my premises, behind a door: I set two men to watch: the next witness can give a farther account; the prisoner was discharged from me last Easter eve.
- Maguire. Mr. Prior set me to watch; and between five and six at night, the prisoner came and took away four pieces of it in a sack, and carried it out of the yard; I followed, and took him with it upon him, and brought him into the prosecutor's house: upon charging him with taking more, he said he would go and shew us where, it was, which he did. (Part of the lead taken upon him produced and deposed to).
Prisoner's Defence.
I went into a public house; a man asked me if I would earn a shilling; I said I would, in an honest way; he sent me for this sack; I went for it, and the man took me as I was coming out at the gate.
He called Mary Matthews,

. I lost a silver mug on Tuesday last, but was not at home when it was lost; the prisoner was a chairwoman
 for me.
Q. Why do you charge her ?
M. Bowman. Because I was sent for to justice Fielding's, and there saw my mug ( produced in court ) my name is on the bottom of it, The prisoner was at the justice's, and she own'd there she took it.
Q. When did you see it last, and where?
M. Bowman. The last time I saw it was in my own house.

            . The prisoner at the bar brought this to me to pawn, and ask'd a guineas on it. I stop'd it, and her, and took them both to Mr. Fielding's, where was Mr. Welch. The prisoner said she would send for the owner of it. First she said she brought it from

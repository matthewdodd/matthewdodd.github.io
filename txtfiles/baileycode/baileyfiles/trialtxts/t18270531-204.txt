RICHARD RILEY. I live in Hackney-road


, and am a salesman
 - this suit of clothes hung outside my window. On the 18th of April I saw it safe at half-past eight o'clock, when I went out - I returned between ten and eleven, and missed it - also a coat. I had seen Gadd pass the shop two or three times, but do not recollect Hayes.

            . I am an officer. I found this dress in Gadd's house about twelve o'clock - he lives with his father and mother. I had been out that morning and saw the two prisoners going to and fro, past Riley's shop. I saw Hayes pull the dress down - Gadd followed him immediately; they went down a turning. I went down another turning to meet them, but could not get that way, About eleven o'clock, I was in Shoreditch, and met the two prisoners in company and took them. I then went to Hayes' house and found the property rolled up in the corner of the stairs.

            . I lodge with Gadd's mother. On the day in question his father and mother were out. The officer came - he knocked at my door, which I opened - it threw a light on the landing-place, and he found the clothes in the corner.

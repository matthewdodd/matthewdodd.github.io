for stealing, on the

JAMES WILLIAM MINSHULL WORTHINGTON
. I am seven years old, and am the son of the Rev. Dr. Worthington, of Mecklenburgh-street. In October, at the end of the month, I was walking in Holborn, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, with a book and cloak on my arm, coming home from school—the prisoner met me, and said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Quite well"—she said, "You know Dr. Worthington?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "If you go down to No. 15, Chancery-lane, you will see a boy, named John, who will give you a bat and ball"—I said I could not go down there, as I had my cloak and book—she said, as she was going home to my mother, she would take them home for me—she took them—I went to No. 15, Chancery-lane, but saw no boy there—I went to No. 16, found no boy there, and a gentleman there wrote a note to my father when I told him of it—I saw nothing more of the prisoner—I am quite sure she is the person.





JAMBS DAVIS
. I am eleven years old, and live with my father, in Finsbury market. I know the prisoner—I saw her the latter end of Oct. at Brook-hill, near Gray's Inn-lane, with a book—she gave me the book, and said I was to take it home to my mother, and she would know what it was—I took it to my mother—this is the book.

MASTER WORTHINGTON
re-examined. This is the book the prisoner took from me—my father supplies me with clothes—his name is James William Minshull Worthington—he is a clergyman and a Doctor of Divinity.




GUILTY
. Aged 17—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There were three other charges against the prisoner.)


Before Lord Chief Justice Denman.

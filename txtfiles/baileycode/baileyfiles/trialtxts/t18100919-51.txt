In the morning, about ten or eleven o'clock; I missed them between ten and eleven at night The box was in an empty room, and one of the doors of of the room was locked, there were two doors to the room, and the door that was not locked was opened. I sent for a constable, and accused the prisoner of it; she denied it;the things were found at the mother's house about eleven o'clock that night.

She said she had been out to her mother to fetch some cloaths; I went to the mother, I asked the mother where her pockets were; she shewed me the pockets, I found the two pound note, a crown-piece, and the pins, in the mother's pocket; she said she knew nothing at all about it: she was in bed.
Q. Did you find any lace - A. Not there. I searched Eleanor's box, I found this four yards and a half of lace; she said, she found the lace in Mr. Cave's room, and she found the two pound note, but the crown-piece was given to her by the woman down stairs.

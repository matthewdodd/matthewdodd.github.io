            . I live in Wood-street, Goswell-road


. The prisoner came on the 11th of August, and hired my truck, in the name of Davis - I had some knowledge of Davis, and let him have it; I asked if he knew what it was for - he said to fetch five kits of salmon - he went away with it, and never brought it back.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. I cannot say that I had - I remember him by the peculiarity of his dress; a young man who was passing by knew him, and took me to his parents.

RICHARD DAVIS. I am a town carman. I know the prisoner, but I did not send him for the truck.

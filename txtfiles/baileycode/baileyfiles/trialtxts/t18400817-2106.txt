GEORGE RUSSELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of August, 1 plank of wood, value 2s., the goods of 



John Joseph Hutchins; and that he had before been convicted of felony.






JOHN JOSEPH HUTCHINS
. I deal in wood, and live in Foley-street. This plank (looking at it) is my property—here is my private mark on it.





JOHN VINLY
. I am a sawyer, and live in Union-street, Middlesex-hospital.

On Monday morning, the 10th of August, the prisoner came to me—I went to Mr. Hutchins's yard with him, to fetch a piece of timber to saw—I went to Holiday's, in Noble-street—the timber was too heavy to carry, I sent him for a truck—he did not return—I went to look for him, and found him at the corner of Foley-street—I charged him with stealing a plank—he said he had not, but he soon after said he had taken one, and put it back where he took it from—I said, "It is no use telling me that; unless you bring the plank back I shall give you into custody," which I did—the plank was found at Smallbone's, in Cumberland-street—I know it to be Mr. Hutchins's.





WILLIAM SMALLBONE
. About a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning the prisoner came and said, "Will you let me leave this here for two or three minutes?" and he left the plank at the top of the railing, outside the door.





JOHN BENT
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the same person who was so convicted.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

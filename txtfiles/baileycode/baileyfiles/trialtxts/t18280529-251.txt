STEPHEN SANDFORD. I keep an eating-house
 in Duke-street


. I missed a shawl and a pelisse from my bed-room, on the 3d of May - I suspected the prisoner, and found him on the 6th of May, in custody; I did not know him before.

            . I was at Guildhall when the prisoner was brought there; he was discharged, to be sent on board a ship - as I went along with him, I said, "It is a pity the man should lose his property;" he then cried, and said, he would show me where it was - he took me to the pawnbroker's; and said, he did not intend to go away without letting the man know where it was.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 1st of May the prisoner pawned this pelisse, and on the 26th of April, this shawl.
Prisoner. It was all through starvation.

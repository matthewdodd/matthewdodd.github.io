            ; her house is No. 2, Holland Park Terrace, in the parish of Kensington


 - she sleeps at Mrs. Maxwell's - I have been in the habit of going to Mrs. Savage's house from eight o'clock in the morning, until four o'clock in the afternoon, to act as a servant there - I have lived at Mrs. Maxwell's twelve months, and Hannibell has been in the habit of going backwards and forwards with messages for her - he was employed in moving for her from Berners-street, to Holland Park Terrace, to Mrs. Savage's, about twelve months ago - he has cleaned knives at Mrs. Savage's; he was employed there last, about six weeks ago - he asked me once if anybody slept in the house, and I told him there was a policeman; I cannot say whether that was the last time he was employed there or before - I cannot say when it was - I do not recollect his asking me that more than once - on the 12th of November, I was at the house; I fastened and bolted all the doors and windows, and left at four o'clock in the afternoon - I left nobody in it - nobody slept there at that time - I locked the outer door and went away - the policeman came round at two o'clock and in consequence of his information, I went to the house at two o'clock on Wednesday morning; I found two policemen in the house - I found the flap of the coal cellar up - it was fixed down in the earth when I was there the day before - I found the drawing room windows opened - I had left those windows safe - one flag stone round the cellar grating had been lifted up - there is a grating in the middle of the stone; it was large enough to admit a person to go down it - I went up stairs to the first floor bed room, and missed a counterpane, and two counterpanes from the next room; I went up stairs and found a trunk broken open, and missed the skirt of a merino dress, and a reticule, two waistcoats, a piece of figured silk, a shawl, and a pair of small clothes - mistress had opened her trunk in my presence, on the 12th of November, and I saw them - she took the things out and I put them in again - the trunk was locked; it was left safe - I have seen these things since at Marylebone station-house - I missed some forks next morning the 14th of November, from a drawer in the china closet - I did not examine the drawer until then - they were there on the 12th of November - Mrs. 
               
                  Sophia

             is a widow - she is at Bath - she lives at No. 7, Lyndon-grove, with Mrs. Maxwell her mother; but she had this house in Holland Park Terrace - she lived there for a week or fortnight only - there has been a family living in the house - it is a house to be let - she has been out of town two or three months.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Mrs. Savage has been away for the last two months? A. Yes; two months from the time we missed the things; she was not living there on the 12th of November - nobody lived in the house - she told me herself these were her own things - her christian name is Sophia - I only know that from what mistress tells me - her husband has been dead two years and a half - I never saw Mr. Savage.

            . (policeman). On the evening of the 12th of November, I met the two prisoners in Upper Seymour-street; they both had bundles; it was about ten minutes before ten o'clock - Preston went up to a door in Seymour-street and said to Hannibell, "This is No. 47;" I crossed over on the other side, and followed them down the street, into Portman-street; one went on one side of the street, and the other on the other; when they came to Oxford-street, Hannibell kept on the left hand, and Preston went on the right; I saw McLean speak to him; I then crossed over and asked Hannibell where he had come from? he said, "From Notting-hill;" Mrs. Savage's house is at Notting-hill; I asked where he was going to - he said, "To the Tower," - I asked if he knew the young man who was with him just now with the bundle - he said, he did and called out "George"- I said, we would go over to him, and not call him over; we went over to him and McLean had him in custody; we took them down to the watch-house, and in the way to the watch-house, I asked Hannibell what he had got there - he said, he did not know - I asked where he got them from - he said, he found them in Edgware-road; I had not then opened the bundles; when I got to the watch-house, I opened the bundles and found one counterpane in a handkerchief, and a counterpane in an apron in Hannibell's bundle; there was nothing else in his bundle; I found a flint steel, a match, and two keys on Hannibell; one of them was a latch key, the other a common box key; I also found on him a bag; it dropped from under his clothes, while I was searching him; there was nothing in it - that is all I found on him - I saw the other bundle opened - there was a reticule in it, also two waistcoats, a counterpane, a pair of small clothes, a piece of figured silk, a shirt, and the skirt of a merino gown.
Cross-examined. Q. What kind of night was it? A. Very foggy; I do not remember whether it had been wet; the roads were not dry - there was a damp from the fog - there were a number of link-boys in Oxford-street; I did not go further; I believe it was such a fog a man might have been one hundred yards off with a link and I not see him - I do not know what parish the house is in.

             (Policeman). On the evening of the 12th of November, I stopped Preston in Oxford-street,he had a bundle, I asked what he had got, he said, a counterpane; I asked him where he had brought it from, he said, from Kensington gravel-pits; I asked where he was going, he said, to his sister's, in St. John-square, Clerkenwell - I took him into custody, Garnett and Hannibell joined me; and when I got to the station-house, I opened the bundle, it contained a pair of small-clothes, two waistcoats, one shift, a shirt, a piece of figured silk, a counterpane, and a reticule bag - I found four plated forks in his pocket.
WILLIAM COWLE (Policeman). I know Mrs. Savage's house. On the night of the 12th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, I was called to the house, and found it had been entered, by a stone being removed in front of the door; it was a square stone, with an iron plate in the middle, it was the plate of the coalcellar - there was quite room enough for either of the prisoners to get down - the coal-cellar is not more than a yard deep - I found the drawing-room window open - the inner-doors of the house were open, they were not broken - I went up stairs, and in the back bed-room, I found a trunk broken open; the drawers in the house were also open.

                  COTTLE
               



            . I know this reticule; there is a note in it, which was taken out, and laid on the ground - these counterpanes I had folded up the day before - all the things were taken out of the house that night - I know the reticule well, Mrs. Savage never uses it; it was a present from a lady.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what Mrs. Savage's husband was? A. A physician; the house in Berner's-street is the house they used to live in when Dr. Savage was living; she has never lived there since he died; she lived at her mother's - there were two bills put up to let the house in Holland-park.
Hannibell's Defence. On the 12th of November, we were lighting a gentleman's horse and chaise, down Notting-hill. I kicked against the bundle. I said to Preston, "George, here is a bundle;" we looked about and found another bundle, and four forks.
Lucy Ralph, of Uxbridge; Mary Preston, Kensington Gravel-pits; Amelia Abel, Kensington Gravel-pits; Mary Anderson, Camden-place, Kensington Gravel-pits; gave the prisoners a good character.

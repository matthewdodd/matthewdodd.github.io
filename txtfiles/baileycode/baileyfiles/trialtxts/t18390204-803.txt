803. 




WILLIAM LONG
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of January, 901bs. weight of lead, value 1l. 1s., the goods of 



John Little; and fixed to a building.






JOHN LITTLE
. I have a building in Weymouth-terrace, in the parish of Shoreditch—it had some lead fixed, which I saw safe on Saturday, the 19th of January—the building was locked in front, and guarded at the back by a wall—I went there afterwards, and the wet came through—I found an aperture in the ceiling large enough to admit a man through—I then missed the lead from the roof—I found the prisoner and the lead at the station-house—I have seen it fitted to the roof—it tallies in all respects.





ELIZABETH DARBY
. I lent the prisoner's wife a bag on the 20th of January, not knowing what it was for.





MAURICE CALNAN
. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 20th of January I was on duty in Hackney-road, near Weymouth-terrace, and saw the prisoner with something bulky on his shoulder—I followed, and asked what he had got—he said some lead—I said, was it sheet lead or pipe—he said he did not know—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "From a man of the name of Palmer"—I took him to the station-house, and found it was new sheet-lead recently cut—I found a knife in his pocket, the blade of which was scratched as if it had cut some hard substance—the owner of the lead came the next day—I went to the building in Weymouth-terrace, and found the lead corresponded exactly with the gutter.

Prisoner. I had it given me by Mr. Palmer.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

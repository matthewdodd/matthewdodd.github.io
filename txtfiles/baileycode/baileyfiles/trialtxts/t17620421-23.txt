            . Last Saturday night I was out in company; and when I got home about 12, I could not get in. I was a little in liquor; then I went to seefor a lodging. Going along by George-alley


, 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



             asked me to go along with her in the alley. She carried me up stairs, and called up 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones 
               



            ; and asked her, what she would have for the bed? Jones said, eighteen pence. I gave it her. Then Smith asked me to give her something to drink. I said, I had been drinking already; but I sent for a pint of beer for her: Jones brought it up. Then Smith asked me for a present, and said, she would go to bed with me? I said, I would give her nothing. She went down stairs, and I went to bed by myself. I had my watch in my breeches, and silver buckles in my shoes. When I had been in bed about half an hour, Mrs. Jones came to fetch the candle away. She awaked me coming up stairs. She asked me, if I would have my cloaths thrown on the bed. I said, yes: She throwed them on me. I heard my watch going as it lay under my head, when she was coming up stairs. She took the candle and went down. I did not bear my watch afterwards. I felt for my breeches, and they were lying on my cloaths. The watch was gone.
Q. Was she near enough to take your watch from your breeches?
Finleyson. She was; but I did not observe her hand at them. I knocked with my shoe. She came up again directly. I said, you have got my watch? She said, she had not. When I was going to put my shoes on, I found a pair of metal buckles in my shoes, and my silver ones gone. This I suppose was done when I was asleep. I went down stairs and locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. Then Jones insisted on the door being opened, and took the poker up twice to wrench the lock back. I was sitting by the fire. Then she went up stairs and came down, and said to me, please to let this gentleman out. When I came to the door, there was man standing upon the stairs. I let him out and put the key in my pocket, and sat down by the fire again. After that, I went out to see if I could see Sarah Smith: I could not find her. Then I went in and locked the door. and put the key in my pocket again, till the watchman came at three o'clock. I told him I had been robbed of my watch and buckles: He went to the watch-house, and brought two men and a constable. I charged them with Jones, and a young woman that sat by the fire asleep. Jones said there was another young woman in bed up stairs. I charged the constable with her, and took all three to the watch-house. The two young women were cleared at Guildhall. After this, Smith was taken; my buckles were found in her shoes. I never saw my watch since.

            . I am constable. I was not the constable that was charged with the three women on the Sunday morning. The constable that had the charge of them, came and told me, as he was taking them to Bridewell. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones 
               



             told him, if he would let her go, or go along with her, she could help him to the buckles and watch. Then I said, I would go with him to her to Bridewell: We went there to her. She said, 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



             had the watch and buckles. I asked her, if I should take her out about 8 at night, whether she could find Smith? She said, she believed she could; for she walked up and down Fleet-street with her every night. The other constable did not meet me, but the prosecutor's master did; his name is Woodhouse, a baker. We went to the matron, and she let Jones come out. I took her in my hand. We went up Fleet-market; we met an old woman: She said to her, mother, have you met the full-breasted girl to-night? because here are me and two more in Bridewell for robbing a baker's man that lives in Harp-alley of a watch and buckles, and she has got them; now the constable is so good to me, to tell me I shall be cleared out of Bridewell, if I can find her. The old woman said, then d - n her, a bitch, we will have her to-night. Then they inquired of a girl, who said she was just gone in at a gin-shop. We went there: She was gone. Then he and the old woman walked up one side of Fleet-street, and I and Jones on the other. He laid hold of Smith just by St. Dunstan's-church, and called me. I took charge of her, and took her to my house in Salisbury-court, and sent him home for his man to see her. I asked Smith, how she came to take the buckles out of his shoes? She said, he changed with her. Said I, how came you to change knee-buckles, for we found his knee-buckles upon her. They were black ones, and his silver buckles in her shoes. [Produced, and deposed to.] She said, that the man the prosecutor let out of the house had got the watch. That man is a drummer in the first regiment of guards; he deserted from the Tower, his name is 
               
                  Robert 
                  Hubbard 
               



            . His drum coat was found in Jone's house. Going with the prisoner to Newgate; Jones said (as I have lost one eye) d - n your squint eye; you have done all the mischief you can, you shall never have the watch again. I had rather be transported, than the drummer should be hanged; for he is a deserter, and will be hanged, if taken. She desired we would carry his coat to the Tower.
Jones in her defence, denied knowing any thing of the taking the watch and buckles.
Smith in her defence said, the prosecutor made a present of the buckles to lie with her.
Both 


               guilty of stealing, but not privately from his person

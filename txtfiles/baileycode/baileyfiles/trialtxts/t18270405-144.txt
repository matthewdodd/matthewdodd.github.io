            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulcher's. On the 27th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in St. John-street, with a bundle, containing this property - he appeared to avoid me; I stopped him, and asked what he had got; he said some thing of his mother's, which he was going to pawn; I took him to the watch-house, and afterwards found the prosecutrix; he was about three minutes' walk from her house.
MARY PARKER. I live in Turnmill-street


, on the third floor. These sheets and petticoat are mine; I left them on my bed about half-past seven o'clock. when I went out; I locked the door, and left the key in it; I found it open when I returned. I have known the prisoner in the neighbourhood.

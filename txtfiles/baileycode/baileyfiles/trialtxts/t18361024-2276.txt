JAMES RALPH
. I am a woollen-draper, and live in Cheapside, in the parish of St. Mary-le-Bow—I have one partner. I had a piece of patent India-rubber on my counter, it is M'Intosh water-proof cloth—I lost twenty-five yards 10l. it is the dwelling of the firm—the servant of the firm there.





GEORGE SCOTT
. I am in the employ of Mr. Ralph. I saw the waterproof cotton cloth on the counter, at about four o'clock on the they in question, and missed it at about seven o'clock—I saw it next morning in the officer's possession, and I knew it to be the same.





JAMES CUTHBERT
. I am an officer of Bread-street. on the 20th of October I saw the prisoner at about half-past six o'clock in the evening, St. Paul's church-yard, going towards Ludgate-hill, with the cloak under his arm—I went up to and asked him where he was going to with it—he said what was to me—I asked him again, he said the same—I had hold him by hand, and then took hold of him with both—he threw the cloth down, and tried to get away—I called for assistance, and got the assistance of the police—I found out the prosecutor next day—he was not a quarter of a mile from Mr. Ralph's shop.

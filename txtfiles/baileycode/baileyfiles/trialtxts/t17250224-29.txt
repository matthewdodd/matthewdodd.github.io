, on the 19th of February
. It appear'd that the Prisoner came at Night to the King's Head-Inn in Smith-field


, and ask'd for a Lodging, telling them that his Father was a Grasier, and would be there the next Morning early. In the Night he got up, and broke open a Cupboard with a Poker, took the Goods, unlock'd the Doors; and not staying to shut them again, he went to a Night-House in Covent Garden; where offering one of the Canes to sell, he was apprehended, and confess'd the Fact.

ROBERT HALEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of Sept., 1 pair of boots, value 14s., the goods of 



Joseph Waite; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES WOOD
. I am errand-boy to Mr. Joseph Waite. On the 11th of Sept., a little before eight o'clock at night, I was sitting behind the desk, and saw the prisoner at the door, moving the boots about, which bung inside the shop—he ran off, and I ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—I kept close behind him to Brewer-street till he was stopped—these are my master's boots.





MARY PUTTUX
. I live in Eaton-lane, Pimlico. A little after eight o'clock I saw the prisoner running down Brewer-street—he threw one boot away—I took it up and gave it to my husband, who gave it to the policeman—this is the boot—the ticket is on it now.





ROBERT LAMBERT
. I found this other boot in a garden in Warwick-row—a man going along Brewer-street could have thrown it there—it is just across the street.

Prisoner's Defence. I was running the way the mob was; I knew no more than the others did.





WILLIAM LEVERS
 (police-constable E 74.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

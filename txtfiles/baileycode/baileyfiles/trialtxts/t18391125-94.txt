ALFRED TAYLOR
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of November, one coat, value 7s., the goods of 



Thomas Hill.






THOMAS HILL
. I am a cab driver. On the 6th of November I left my cab in Lambeth-street, near Flying-horse-yard—when I returned in about ten minutes, the coat which I had left on the box was gone—my wife went and succeeded in finding it—this is it—(looking at it.)





ANN HILL
. I am the prosecutor's wife. I went down Rosemary-lane, and as I returned to the end of the Minories I met the prisoner with the coat—I knew it by the lining—I let him pass—I then saw the cuffs and knew it—I took him by the collar and struggled some time, but I never let him go till he was in the hands of the officer.

Prisoner's Defence. I was sitting at home at a quarter before eight o'clock—a young man asked me to go and sell it for him—I was going and met this woman—the other man went away.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

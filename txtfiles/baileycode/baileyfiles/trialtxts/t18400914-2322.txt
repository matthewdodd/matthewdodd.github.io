GERTRUDE HAWKINGS ROBERTS
. I am single, and live in Bentinck-street, Berwick-street, Soho. The prisoner was my lodger—I missed the articles stated out of a chest of drawers at different times—they were locked.





JAMES DRISCOLL
 (police-constable C 2.) In consequence of informations, I apprehended the prisoner in Peter-street, St. James's, and took her to the station-house—she said she lived in Husband-street, but she did not know the number—she said it was the first floor front room—I went there to Priddy's house, and found these articles in a middle drawer.






SARAH PRDDY
. I live at No. 7, Husband-street. The prisoner lodged in my room from Monday till Thursday—when she came in she put a bundle on the top of my bed, and said it was her bundle—I pat it in my middle drawer, as she had no box—I do not know what was in it—I saw her go to the bundle, and take the pocket-handkerchief, or something—the policeman took the bundle away.





GERTRUDE HAWKINGS ROBERTS

re-examined. These things are mine—some are marked—the prisoner said she got her living by making shirts—I was not with her, as my occupation takes me out—she appeared a decent well behaved girl, but I understand did not keep good hours—I was not at home while she was there—I left all my drawers locked—on the 14th of August, when I went home, I found two strange keys in my drawer, and she was gone—I gave them to the officer—one appeared like a picklock—she said at the station-house if I would not appear against her, she would tell me where all the things were.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

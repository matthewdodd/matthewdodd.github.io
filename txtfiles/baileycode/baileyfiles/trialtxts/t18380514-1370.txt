JOHN GILSON
 and 




EDWARD GILSON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
28th of March, 115lbs. weight of lead, value 20s., the goods of 



Henry Gunson, and fixed to a building.






HENRY GUNSON
. I live at West Ham. On the 25th of March I saw the lead safe on my summer-house, and on the 28th I missed it—I have compared this lead with the place it was taken from, and it corresponds in every respect—(looking at it.)

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you compare it since you

were before the Magistrate? A. No, before—I believe I told the Magistrate I had done so, but I am not certain—I identified it.





PETER HILL
. I am a gardener. About six o'clock in the morning of at 28th of March, I met the two prisoners coming up the side of the field—they had these two rolls of lead—each of them had one under his arm—I asked where they got it from—they said from their uncle—they left the lead in the road, right opposite Mr. Gunson's lodge, and walked away—I am sure the prisoners are the persons.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you known them before? A. I had seen them—I did not know them by name—I never spoke to them, or knew where they lived—I had seen them in a gentleman's garden, where I used to work—they got over the fence after the apples.





JOHN ELSON
. I am a constable of Plaistow. I compared this lead with the summer-house, and it corresponded exactly.





WILLIAM GIBLING
. I took the prisoner on the 26th of April. One was in prison then.

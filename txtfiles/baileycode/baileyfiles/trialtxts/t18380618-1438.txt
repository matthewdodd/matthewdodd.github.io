JACOB FOSTER REYNOLDS
. About three o'clock on the afternoon of the 17th of March, I was passing from Bucklersbury to King William-street—in consequence of information I followed the prisoner—while I was accosting her and charging her with the theft, which she denied, the officer came up, and took her to the Mansion-house—this handkerchief was found upon her—it is mine, and had been in my possession five minutes before.

Prisoner. Q. Was I not walking from Cheapside towards the Mansion house? A. I did not observe you till I was spoken to—I had never seen you before.





WILLIAM HENRY MANNERS
. I was at the Mansion-house—I saw the prisoner with a woman named Diana Pearce—I saw Pearce touch the prisoner, who ran, and I saw her take the handkerchief out of the gentlemau's pocket—I told the gentleman directly after.

Prisoner. I saw the handkerchief on the ground, and took it up. Witness. She did not pick it up.





THOMAS WOODRUFF
 (City police-constable No. 77.) I took the handkerchief from her bosom—she said she had not got it—I said, "Kate, if you have got it, let us have it."

Prisoner. I did not say I had not got it; I said I picked it up, and I was not near the back of the Mansion-house—I had not seen Diana Pearce for six months before.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

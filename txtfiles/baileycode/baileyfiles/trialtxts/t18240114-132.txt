            . I live in Norfolk-court, Saffron-hill


. The prisoner lodged in the same room as me. On the 18th of December I went out, leaving her in the room with my three children. I returned in an hour and a half, andmissed two gowns and five yards of stuff from my box, which were safe when I went out. She had told me she was going out for some broken victuals - she did not return, but on the Sunday following I met her in Fleet-market, and gave her in charge. One gown was made up, and the other not.
(Property produced and sworn to).
THOMAS M'CLELLAN. I am an officer. I received her in charge, and found two duplicates on her for this property inside her stocking, next to her feet.

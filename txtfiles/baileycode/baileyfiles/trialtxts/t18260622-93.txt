On Saturday evening, the 3d of June, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with something under his coat; I asked what he had got - he said, "My tools, to be sure;" I asked who he worked for, and he said Mr. Price; I found the tools under his coat; and as we went down the Curtain-road he said, "I will tell you the truth - the fact is I found them;" this guage was found in his hat.

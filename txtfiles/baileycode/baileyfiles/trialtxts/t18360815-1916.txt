JAMES GODFREY
 and 




WILLIAM SHELTON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
28th of July, 1 tame fowl, value 6s., the property of 




Simon Williams.






SIMON WILLIAMS
. I keep the Queen's Head, York-square, Commercial Road. I had a tame cock—I saw it safe in the stable about seven o'clock on the 25th of July, and missed it the next morning—the prisoners were in my yard playing at skittles on the evening of the 25th—the policeman found the fowl—it was mine—the wings of it are here.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Had you employed the prisoners to remove a table? A. Yes—I gave them some beer—they staid playing at skittles the whole of the evening, from five or six o'clock till about eleven o'clock—the fowl-house is alongside of the skittle-ground—when they left the house they were not the worse for liquor.





WILLIAM ISAACS
 (police-constable K 223.) At four o'clock in the morning, I was passing by an unoccupied house in Limehouse-fields—I heard a noise—I called my brother-officer, and we found the two prisoners sleeping, with this fowl by their side—these are the wings—it was dead, but not cold.

Cross-examined. Q. Were the prisoners asleep? A. They were, or else pretending it—it was their snoring that caused me to go in—this fowl was close by them—I got over the boarded fence, about five feet and a half high—I found six fowls and a saucepan by them, but no fire.

GODFREY—


GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

SHELTON—


GUILTY
. Aged 17.—



Confined Six Months.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoners.)

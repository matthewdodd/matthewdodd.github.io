JAMES JERVIS. I keep the Castle, public-house, Castle-street, Holborn




. On the 10th of June, about one o'clock in the day, I discovered that my cellar window was forced open, that some one had then got in, and forced the cellar door open, and stolen this cask of rum. The officer came in a few minutes. I found the prisoner in custody with it at Guildhall. It must have been done in the night.

            . I am a watchman of Castle-street. On the 10th of June, about three o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Castle-street, with this cask in a bag, and asked how he came by it; he said he got it from a public-house facing the Old Bailey - I asked if it was a watering house; he said he did not know, but would shew it to me. I put him in the watch-house, then went and enquired at the different public-houses, but could hear nothing of it. He afterwards said it was smuggled liquor, and he had brought it from Wapping, that a man was to give him 2 s. to carry it to the corner of Oxford-street. Jervis's name was on a label on it. I found the bolt of his cellar door wrenched off.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written Defence, begging for Mercy.

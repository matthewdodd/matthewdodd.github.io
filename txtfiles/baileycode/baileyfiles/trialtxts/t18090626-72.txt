            . On the 9th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the little room adjoining the shop; I heard a noise in the shop, I turned my head, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop with two chairs; I went after her, and brought her back and the chairs; then we applied to Mr. James, to take her to Hatton Garden office.

            . I am a constable of St. Andrews, Holborn. On the 9th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was sent for to Mr. Harvey's. I took the prisoner in custody.
The property produced and identified.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of taking the chairs; I went in to buy these chairs and a small table. I looked at them, and went towards the door; that young woman said I wanted to steal them; she called her uncle down. I was taken to the office and committed.

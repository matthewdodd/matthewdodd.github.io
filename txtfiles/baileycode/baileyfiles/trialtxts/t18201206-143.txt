The street-door is open all day.

            . I am a watchman. On the 31st of October, about eight o'clock, I was standing in Portman-square, and saw the prisoner with a bundle; when he saw me coming towards him, he turned into the middle of the road; I asked him what he had got? he said two blankets from Mrs. Western, to take to get washed. I felt something hard in the bundle, and asked him if it was soap? he said it was a clock; I asked him if that was to be washed too? he said No, Mrs. Western was moving. I took him to the watch-house, he then said the things belonged to Mrs. Joyce. I took up a spike nail, which he dropped.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded extreme distress.

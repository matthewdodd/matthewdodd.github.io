            . The prisoner was my servant
; she had asked leave of her mistress to go out, and returned about three o'clock; the servants told me she was gone out again with a cheese. I took her in the Bell ale-house, Mincing-lane; the cheese was two yards distance from her in the passage; she had dropped it before I came. (The cheese produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . The prisoner came home earlier than I expected, about two o'clock. I saw her go out with the cheese; she endeavoured to hide it with her apron, but I saw it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take the cheese from my master; I found the cheese and carried it home.
Q. to Duffill. Did she come in with any cheese?
Duffill. I did not see her come in.
Prosecutor. Each dairy have a mark and number; they are marked with the number at the dairy.

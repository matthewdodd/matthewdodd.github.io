            . I keep a public house
 at Clerkenwell-green


; the prisoner is a soldier
; he was quartered at my house. On the morning of the 11th of March he desired me to lend him the key of the chamber, for the purpose of taking out his clothes; another person hurried him to make haste; I lent him the key; a short time after I had occasion to go up, and found my watch gone; then I went on the guard; the prisoner had deserted; I afterwards found he was taken up as a deserter; I went to him; first he denied he had the watch; afterwards he said he took the watch and was sorry for it.

            . I was sent by the prosecutor to the prisoner in New Prison; I saw him there; he said he was very sorry for it; he had sold the watch for thirty shillings.
Prisoner's Defence.
That confession was obtained from me on advice given me by the prosecutor to say this to deliver myself from military punishment.

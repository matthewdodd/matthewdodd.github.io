            . On Tuesday the 16th of August about one o'clock I stopped at the corner of Fenchurch-street


 while some carts passed; I felt something at my right hand pocket; I looked over my shoulder and saw the prisoner with my pocket handkerchief in his hand; I laid hold of him and charged him with it, he denied it; I took him before my Lord Mayor. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).
- Griffin deposed, that he was with Mr. Payne, saw him seize the prisoner and take the handkerchief upon him.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

            . I was looking after my Daughter Eleanor Griffin's Shop in Red-lion-square


, and the two Prisoners were standing at the Door; I had Occasion to go backwards, and returning presently, I saw Royley in the Shop with something under her Ridinghood. Good Woman, says I, you have got something there. No I han't, says she, and stepp'd out; I follow'd her, and call'd out to a Man who stopp'd her.

            . As I went by the Prosecutor's Door I saw Judge on the Steps, and Royley in the Shop, by the Counter-side, and nobody else being in the Shop, I suspected them, and passing by the Door, stood to watch. Presently Royley came out, and Mrs. Atkinson follow'd, and cry'd, Spher ; which I did, and saw this Piece of Check under her Riding-hoop, but she dropp'd it in the Dirt before I could take it from her. Judge, by this Time, was got to Theobald's-Row, which is about 100 Yards from the Shop, but I ran after her, and brought her back.
The Jury found Royley 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.
             and 

               acquitted
             Judge.

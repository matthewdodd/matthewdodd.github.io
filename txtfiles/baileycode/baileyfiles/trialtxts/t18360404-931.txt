LAURITZ HANSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
17th of March, 1 sheet, value 5s., the goods of 



Thomas Cansdell.






THOMAS CANSDELL
. I keep the Hoop and Horse-shoe, in Queen-street, Tower-hill. The prisoner came on a Sunday night, in March, and hired a bed, about half-past eleven o'clock—he was a stranger to me the house was shut up, and he knocked at the door—Mrs. Cansdell called me down to him—I said he could not sleep there—he said he wanted to go into the docks in the morning, and I let him have a bed—he said he wanted to go as soon as the dock opened, which was about seven o'clock; and in the morning, he went out—I opened the street-door—he partly opened it himself, and seemed in a hurry—I sent the servant up stairs, and in consequence of what she said, I pursued him—he went towards Whitechapel—I sent the boy after him, who brought him back he had a bundle under his arm—we opened that—he said that

was not the street—we took him up stairs—he unbuttoned his waistcoat, and the sheet was found bound round his person—he said, "This is your sheet—forgive me—I am very sorry for it—I wanted to get to Germany."





CATHERINE JEALOUS
. I am servant of the house. I remember the prisoner going away in the morning—I missed a sheet—I cannot swear to this sheet; but when I turned the bed down there were two sheets on it, and in the morning one was gone—I believe this is master's sheet.





JAMES HAWARD
. I am a policeman. I received the prisoner in charge—I saw him in the house with a bundle—I took him up stairs, and found the sheet wrapped round him—he went down on his knees, and said, "Don't put me to so much trouble—this is your sheet, Mr. Cansdell—I took it from the bed—I wanted to go to Germany—I have no money—I am very poor."
(The prisoner put in a written defence, pleading poverty.)




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.

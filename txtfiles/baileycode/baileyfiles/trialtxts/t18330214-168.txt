            , who lives in Piccadilly


, and is a warehouseman
. I saw the prisoner in his passage on the 2nd of February - he went out of the door, down the steps, and passed the shop window; I looked, and missed a roll of canvas - I called some one to mind the shop, but no one came; I ran after the prisoner, and saw him crossing Regent-street - I called the officer, who took him with the property on him.

               stealing a silver watch, a cornelian seal, a pair of silver buckles, and a pair of leather breeches
            , the property of

                   HOARE
               



            . I live at Farnham in Surry


, and am a cutler
 by trade: in November last I lost a silver watch, a cornelian seal, a pair of silver buckles, and a pair of leather breeches. I went to bed about eleven o'clock: the things were in a chair, and a person came into my bed-room and took them when I was asleep. The door was shut, but not locked: there was no body else lay in the room that night.

You don't know who took those things? - No: the breeches and buckles were found on the prisoner.

                   ANGUS
               



            . I am constable of St. Martin's, Ludgate. On the 31st of October it was my night to attend at St. Bride's watch-house.

             and another person brought down the prisoner at the bar to our watch-house, charged with robbing 
               
                  Thomas
                   Hoare
               



             of a watch and three guineas: I examined the prisoner, and found a pair of silver shoe buckles, a pair of knee buckles, and a pair of breeches upon him, which the prosecutor swore to be his property. I likewise found on the prisoner a pawnbroker's duplicate for a watch. He owned that the buckles and breeches were the property of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Hoare
               



            ; said he was a clockmaker
, and went to work at Farnham: he was late out on a Saturday night, and went home with his master's son; his master insisted he should be let in; he was in the room some time, was taken ill, and put on the prosecutor's breeches, shoes, and buckles in a mistake, and went down stairs; that he was ashamed of it, and when it was day-light he set off for London.


                  JOHN
                   SALTER
               



            . I am a pawnbroker: on the 11th of October I took a watch in pledge from the prisoner at the bar. He redeemed it on the 14th, and pledged it again on the Monday following (The watch was produced).


                  Thomas
                   Hoare
               



            , after looking at the watch, said, I am positive that is my watch, and had her that night I was robbed, and missed her in the morning.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was out rather too late that night, and walked home. The prosecutor told me he came from London: we had some discourse together. I said I had not been long from London, and had a wife and three children there. Mr. Hoare lent me those things for a week or fourteen days. Mr. Hoare was in liquor.
The Prosecutor was asked if it was true that he had lent them to the prisoner? he said he never saw the prisoner till he was called before Alderman Plomer.



               GUILTY

Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

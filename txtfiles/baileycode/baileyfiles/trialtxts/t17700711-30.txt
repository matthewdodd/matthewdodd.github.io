            . I am a carter
, and live in Ratcliffe highway


; I lost a coat from the bin in the stable; the prisoner came there along with my fellow-servant; we went out, and when we came back again. the great coat was gone. I met him afterwards in Shoreditch; he confessed he stole the coat; and that he first pawned it, and then sold it. He confessed the same before the Justice.
Prisoner's Defence.
I asked him to let me be in the stable; when he refused me, I went away, and I know nothing of the great coat.

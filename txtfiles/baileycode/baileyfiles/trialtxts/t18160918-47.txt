                  WAITHMAN
               



            . I am a linen draper
, and live in Fleet-street. I lost a handkerchief, on the 20th of last month, at about nine, or half past nine in the evening; I was walking along Fleet-street near Temple-bar


, and a person came up to me, and said that person who was walking before me had taken my handkerchief; I am sure it was in my pocket when I left my house. On feeling in my pocket I immediately missed it; I went forward and stopped the prisoner, who was a few yards before me, I charged him with stealing my handkerchief, and he denied it; I laid hold of him by the collar, and on my shewing symptoms of an intention to search him, he put his hand under his coat, which was buttoned, and drew the handkerchief out, and dropped it; it was worth about six shillings. I had a constable, and took him into custody.

            . I saw the prisoner behind Mr. Waithman, and saw him take the handkerchief out of Mr. Waithman's pocket. I gave Mr. Waithman information, and saw the handkerchief dropt by the prisoner, as Mr. Waithnran has stated.
JOHN WILL1S. I am a constable. I received charge of the prisoner, and the property.



               GUILTY

               Transported for Seven Years

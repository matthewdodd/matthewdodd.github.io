             sworn.
I am wife of the prosecutor; I lost the things in the indictment; I did not know the prisoner before; I had been washing the day before, and hung these things in the kitchen the night before; and I took them down in the morning, and put them on the dresser, and went into the parlour; and coming back, I met the prisoner with the things in her apron; I gave charge of her.
(The things deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A woman that I knew about five years ago, treated me with about four or five glasses of liquor; and she said she would take me home; and she took me to this house; I do not know how the things came into my lap.

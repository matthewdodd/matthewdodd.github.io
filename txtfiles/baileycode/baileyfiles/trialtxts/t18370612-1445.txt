ABRAHAM PHILIPS BROMWICH
. On the 19th of December the prisoner asked me for change for a £5 note, to take to Mr. Fowler—I gave him four sovereigns, four half-crowns, eight shillings, and four sixpences—he never returned to me again.





GEORGE FOWLER
. I did not tell the prisoner to bring me change for a £5 note—he brought me a bill of his master's on the 14th of November, which I paid him, and have his receipt for it—I never saw him after that.




GUILTY

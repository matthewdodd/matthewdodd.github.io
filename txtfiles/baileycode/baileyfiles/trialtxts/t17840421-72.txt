             sworn.
On the 6th instant, a cask of currants was taken out of the King's warehouse, to be opened and examined by the broker; I opened them, and after that they were fastened up, it was stole out of the Globe yard


 the same day; it was left in the Globe yard till the afternoon, and missed in the afternoon between four and five; I was not present, I only know the cask to be Mr. Batley's property.

             sworn.
I saw 
               
                  Richard
                   Kilminster
               



             and 
               
                  John
                   Tinney
               



             come into the Globe-yard, and roll the cask into Thames-street, and take and put it into James Hall's cart; Vincent helped them to put it into Hall's cart; then John Lloyd saw the cart going away with it, then he stopped the cart.


                  JOHN
                   RILEY
               



             sworn.
This day three weeks, about five, going into the Waterman's-arms, in Globe-yard, they were rolling the cask out of the yard, the prisoner Kilminster rolled it, and the other received it, they were all there then assisting; Vincent was turning the cart round; Mr. Lloyd and I pursued him as far as Sam's coffee-house, then the barrel was pulled out of the cart; I know the prisoners perfectly, I have marked them in the street.


                  JOHN
                   LLOYD
               



             sworn.
I was at the Waterman's-arms, and I stopped the cart; the prisoner Vincent was drawing the cart, I did not see the others at the time; Tinney pulled out the cask, and he had liked to have dashed it to pieces, it was in Mr. Batley's people's care; it is here in Court; (the cask deposed to) there are two hundred and seventeen pounds weight of currants in it.
PRISONER KILMINSTER's DEFENCE.
I was down at the Custom-house key, and this 
               
                  Henry
                   Vincent
               



             came to me and the other, and they said there was a gentleman wanted a cart, and we went up and took it up.
PRISONER TINNEY's DEFENCE.
I have nothing more to say.
PRISONER VINCENT's DEFENCE.
I was standing in Thames-street, facing the Custom-house, and a man hired me to get a cart, and I went and got Mr. Hall's cart; the man went to dinner and left me in care of it.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

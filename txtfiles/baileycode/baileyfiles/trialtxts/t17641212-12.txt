            . Last Saturday was se'ennight, about a quarter before six, coming along Lombard-street


, I felt something tugging at my pocket; I turned my head about; the prisoner's hand hit my elbow. I saw him put my handkerchief behind him: I searched, and could not find it upon him; he said, perhaps I had drop'd it; we were then about two or three yards from the place where I saw it in his hand; we went back, and he picked it up; there was nobody near me but the prisoner, when I felt the tug. (The handkerchief produced, and deposed to).
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw two chaps turn the corner, and drop something; when he charged me, I told him I saw something fall from them; I went back, and picked his handkerchief up, and gave it to him. I live with Mr. Russel, in Bunhill-Row.

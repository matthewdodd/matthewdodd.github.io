            . On the 5th of June, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and two others in the City-road - he had this coat on, and the other had this basket; the prisoner ran away, and I seized the one who had the basket, and found in it an old coat - I ran after the prisoner, and said,
"Young man, I think this coat will fit you best;" he took this off, and put the old one on.

            . I assisted in taking the prisoner - he conducted himself most desperately all the way to the watch-house; and used most blasphemous language.

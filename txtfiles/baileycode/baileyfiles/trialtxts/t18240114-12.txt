            . I live in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street, and am a carpenter
. On the 19th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-market


; my handkerchief was in my outside coat pocket. I did not feel it taken - somebody said it was gone; I turned round and missed it. The prisoner was within a yard of me, in company with another boy. I laid hold of him, and saw him put his hand under his coat, and draw it from under his clothes; it fell on the ground, and I picked it up. The other boy went off.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going on an errand - a waggon stopped at the Angel; I stood for it to pass, then went on. A gentleman took hold of me, and the handkerchief laid at my feet.

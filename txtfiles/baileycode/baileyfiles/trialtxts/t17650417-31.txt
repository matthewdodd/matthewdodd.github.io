                  Duffin 
               



            . I am wife to 
               
                  John 
                  Duffin 
               



            . My husband is porter
 to the Honourable Society of Lincoln's-Inn. On the 9th of March, in the evening, I found I was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment: the prisoner was taken up, and she confessed she had taken them. I found the handkerchief pawned at Mr. Slayter's, in Shoe-lane, for 2 s. and four tea-spoons pawned at Mr. Day's, facing St. Andrew's church, Holbourn, for 3 s. 6 d. and an apron and cap for 2 s. she said she would not tell where the tea-chest was pawned, if the justice would give her 50 guineas; but said it was pawned by a woman that was living. She said I should have my chest and all my things, if I would not prosecute her.

            . The prisoner pledged these four tea-spoons to me, in the name of Dukes, on the 9th of March. (Produced, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)

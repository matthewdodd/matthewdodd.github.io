             sworn.
I was in our counting-house, and I saw the prisoner take one piece of velveret, he had one piece under his left arm before I saw him in the counting-house; he walked out, and I followed him, I overtook him, he perceived me following him, and I saw him throw them down, he went a little further before I took him, he never was out of my sight.

             sworn.
The last witness cried out stop thief, and just as I turned my head I saw him drop them down, I picked them up, I held them in my hand till he had got them, and I gave them to Mr. Banks.
(The velveret produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was never in the house, nor never had the parcels in my hand, I was coming along the street and heard the cry of stop thief, and I was running as well as the rest and the man laid hold of me, I have not had time to send for my witnesses.

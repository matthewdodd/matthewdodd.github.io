HARRIET GALLENT
. I am the wife of Thomas William Gallent; I lodge in Kingsgate-street, Holborn. I was going out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 8th of May, and saw the prisoner coming out of the prosecutor's parlour—I went into the passage, and said, "What do you want here?"—he said he came from Mr. Jenner's, the dyer's, and he wanted Mr. Jones's office—I detained him—he struggled and struck me—Mrs. Maher came to my assistance—I said she had better go into the parlour, and then she missed these things.





MARIA MAHER
. I am the wife of John Maher; we live in Fisher-street, Red Lion-square. I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner in the passage—I went into the parlour, and missed from a box an eye-glass, and these other things—the eye-glass and pin are my son's, Thomas Maher—I went into the passage, and taxed the prisoner with having my property, and he produced it from his pocket.





CHARLES HAWKER
. I am a policeman. I was sent for an took the prisoner—he had given up the property before I got there.

Prisoner, I never struck her at all—it is false.

 stealing, on the

JE'O'A LONDON
. I am a widow, living in Golden-lane. The prisoners took the lodgings of me, from some circumstances I thought it necessary to examine them, and the articles stated were missing—the prisoners had been there about three weeks—these are the things—(examining them)—they are mine—I did not authorise the prisoners to pawn them.





JOHN ORBELL
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce a sheet, pawned by the female prisoner on the 3rd of January, and a counterpane, pawned by a woman, on the 17th of January, but I do not know who.

Letitia Jackson. I did not pledge the articles, I sent them. Witness. I may be mistaken.





BENJAMIN SHEADER
. I am in the employ of Mr. Sowerby, a pawn-broker. I took in this quilt of a female, whom I believe to be the prisoner, but cannot swear it.





BENJAMIN BAKER
 (police-constable G 43.) I found the duplicates of these things in the lodgings, and took the prisoners—the man said they had pledged the things, but intended to get them oat as soon as they got some money.

JAMES JACKSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 25.

LETITIA JACKSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 27.




Transported for Seven Years.

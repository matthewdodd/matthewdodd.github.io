JOHN SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of July, I printed book, value 6s., the goods of 



Isaac Gregory.






ISAAC GREGORY
. I keep a bookseller's shop, in Bloomsbury. This is my book—I saw it safe at twenty minutes before four o'clock, on the 19th of July, when the prisoner came to my shop with another young man—my attention was attracted to his companion—after the prisoner had looked at the books some time, I saw him go to the window, and he left the shop—I then missed this book, and followed—he dropped it, and I took it up.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it? A. Yes, I did, from the window—I saw you drop it from under your coat—I grasped you, but you ran away—I lost sight of you—you were brought back in about seven minutes.





WILLIAM HARRIS
 (police-constable E 161.) I saw the prisoner drop the book in Broad-street, as the prosecutor caught hold of him—I then chased, and took him.

Prisoner. Q. Was there no mob came round when you took me? A. Yes, there was.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Holborn; I saw a crowd; I ran,

and got at the head of the mob; I got as far as Monmouth-street; the policeman took me; he supposed I had done something wrong.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

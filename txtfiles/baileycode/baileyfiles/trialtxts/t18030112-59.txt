                  ARMSTRONG
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. We know you are an officer belonging to Worship-street? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you go to Mr. Jobson's house on the morning this affair was discovered? - A. Yes: On Friday, the 7th of January, the prisoner was brought to the office; I went to Mr. Jobson's house, I was shewn the pantry, the door, is painted chocolate, and the side of the door white; on the side of the door, by the lock, there was a little chipping on the edge.
Q. By the chipping, did it appear to you as if the lock had been broke? - A. It appeared to be done to shew that.
Court. Q. Could it be of any use to force the door? - A.Certainly not; I then tried the lock, and found it perfect; I then shut the door, and there was no appearance at all of force against the door.
Mr. Knapp. Q. Where did you go afterwards? - A. I then went to the kitchen-door, which commands the entrance from up stairs, which has nineteen steps to the kitchen-door, and there I found this box, which recieves the lock, lying upon the steps; and the screw of that door opens inwards from the house into the kitchen.
Q. In order to get that off, must it have been got off inside the kitchen? - A. It must; because I looked at teh jaumbs of the door to see if there had been any force used on the inside, and there was none.
Q. Was there any appearance of force as if the person had come from the area throught the kitchen? - A. None.
Q. Suppose any person came from the area through the kitchen towards the pantry, did it appear as if any person coming from the area had opened this door? - A. No, the contrary; I was then shewn another kitchen-door, which leads to the area under the stone steps; I looked at that door, and there was no violence at all, and that door lock inwards, and opens inwards into the kitchen; after viewing that, and finding no force there, I shut the door which leads into the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, underneath the pavement, at the end of that knifeplace was a privy, upon viewing this place I saw a number of bricks, and I called for a light, I looked in the dust-hole, Vickery immediately called out to me, Armstrong, I have found the plant; I looked down the privy, and at the end of the privy, under the seat, upon the side. I observed something white; I then got the kitchen tongs, and moved a brick that lay before it, and this tablecloth was produced, tied up, and when I opened it, it contained these articles of plate, and two more table-cloths, and two towels, on the soil;(produces all the articles mentioned in the indictment); this chopper was produced to me in the kitchen, I compared it, and in the door I found the impression of this chopper, upon the sill of the door, where it had been chopped.
Q.(To Soane.) Did you find this chopper? - A. Yes.

Q.What did you do with it? - A. I hung it up again in its place, and afterwards delivered it to Mr. Armstrong.
Q.(To Mr. Jobson.) Are these articles of plate your's? - A. They are.
Q. And these table-cloths and towels? - A. They are.
Prisoner's defence. I locked my pantry-door every night, but the lock catches; I am frequently obliged to lock it several times before I can make it lock. I went to bed that night, and did not come down any more till the next morning; but Susan came up for the tinder-box. I know nothing of any body getting into the house; I am very innocent of what I am charged with; there was no occasion for me to have broke the lock when I had the key in my pocket; there is a door at the back part of the house that is very seldom locked; there is nothing but a latch.
Prosecutor. There is a building behind the house, but it is impossible any body can come in that way; it is only a way from one part of the house to another.
Jury. Q.(To Green.) Had the prisoner any candle in his hand when you saw him? - A. No, he had not.
Q. Was there sufficient light for you to be able to see the face of a man? - A. Yes, I am quite positive he is the man.

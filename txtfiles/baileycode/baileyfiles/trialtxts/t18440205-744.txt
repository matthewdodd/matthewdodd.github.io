RICHARD COLLETT
. I keep a beer-shop, in Barrett-grove, Stoke Newington. This piece of canvas and sack are mine—they were in a stable—I saw them safe about a fortnight ago—I lost them last Monday morning—I had frequently seen the prisoner about my place.

JAMES PLAYFORD

Prisoner's Defence. I found the sacks on the dust hill, at Mr. Newman's, Ball's Pond, opposite the new market.

JAMES WILD
. I am a policeman. I was at Deptford fair, on the 12th of Jane, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner attempting several pockets, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, lifting them up and feeling if there was any thing in them—I saw him take this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—I was about to lay hold of him, but a sudden mob came, and he threw it down—the prosecutor picked it up, and I laid hold of the prisoner—there were four of them acting together, but I did not know them—he was the only one who was forward feeling the pockets—I had been watching him some time—I have not a doubt they were all acting together, and at times they all stood talking together.

Prisoner. There was another man by me, and he took him and swore at the station-house that he was the one who took the handkerchief. Witness. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he is talking of a case tried last evening of another prisoner, who took another handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket about the same time—I took another person at the time who was talking to him, and he turned out to be a waterman's apprentice.





RICHARD WAYLETT
. I am a pawnbroker. I was at the fair, and had this handkerchief in my pocket—I felt it gliding from me—I turned round and saw the prisoner immediately behind me—I said, "You have taken my handkerchief, where have you put it? give it to me"—I immediately saw it on the ground near him, and I believe he is the person who threw it away.




GUILTY

            . I live in Ivy-Lane, and am a grocer
; on the 8th of March in the morning, my journeyman told me he had missed seven shillings and sixpence, and suspected the prisoner had taken them. I went to a scale-beam maker, and desired him to stamp five shillings in halfpence with a cypher, which he did; I put it in the till in the morning; I missed some; I sent for a constable and took him up and searched him, and found twenty-pence of the halfpence that was marked, and five shillings in halfpence, which he had taken from out of another place, with the paper with the letter G on it, that they came in to me. The prisoner confessed he took them, and that they were my property.

            , a servant to the prosecutor, confirmed the whole of his evidence.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

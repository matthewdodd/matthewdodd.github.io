. On the 5th of October I was working in the parlour, the prisoner, tried the door twice that evening, the third time he managed to open it without the bell ringing-the alarm was given - I saw him in the shop. He had pulled out two tills, which contained a quantity of halfpence, and silver. I ran to the door, and shut him in-my neighbours came to my assistance - He dropped the money on the floor - He had taken the silver, and left the halfpence - He had his shoes off.
JOSEPH ADDY. I was sitting in the parlour about nine o'clock, and heard the prisoner in the shop-he was taken and he said his companions held the bell, while he opened the door-the floor was covered with silver, which he had thrown down.

THOMAS BRADLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of May, 2 bells, value 15s., the goods of 



James William Morrison, and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.; and that he had been before convicted of felony.


MR. PAYNE
conducted the Prosecution,
JAMES BROOK. I am a watchman at Snaresbrook. About two o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of May, I was on duty—there was an alarm at Mr. Lennox's—I went towards there, and saw two men coming from the place—I stopped the prisoner, who was one of them, and the other ran sway—I found this bell in the prisoner's left hand, and this piece of a gunbarrel in his right—I locked him up, and next morning a sack and six bells were found a little way from where I took him.

Prisoner. Q. Did not the other man come back? Witness. No—he would not let me take hold of him.





RICHARD HAYWARD
. I am servant to James William Morrison. We bad some bells fixed at our premises on the night of the 9th of May—I missed two at a quarter past six o'clock next morning, and while the gardener and I were examining the footsteps, Brooks brought seven bells—this is one of them—it had been fixed inside the fence which surrounds the premises—the paling is about eight feet high.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down to Lee Bridge, and saw two men—they told me if I went near them they would knock my brains out—they went away, and there was this bell and piece of gun-barrel—I took them up.





JOHN ROWE
. I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Parker, the Clerk of the Peace at Chelmsford—(read)—I was present at the prisoner's trial, and took him on the charge—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

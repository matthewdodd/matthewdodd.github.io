DAVID BRANDON
. I am an architect, residing in Southampton-street. In November last, the prisoner came into my service—I had a good character with her for seven years—she staid till March, and then absented herself without warning—those sheets, pillow-case, blankets, table-cloths, covers, and the other articles in the indictment, are mine.





JOHN SELL
. I am foreman to a pawnbroker, in Bridges-street, Coventgarden. I have a great variety of goods—the greater part were pledged by the prisoner, between the 21st and 25th of March.





JOHN TICKNER
. I am shopman to Young and Luxmore, of St. Martins-lane. I produce a table-cover, a shirt, plated dessert spoons, and other things, which were pawned by the prisoner, between the 14th of December and the 25th of March.





THOMAS POCOCK
 (police-constable F 38.) I bad the prisoner in custody at the station—she told me she had a box at Somers-town Crescent—I went there, and found in the box twenty-one duplicates—she said she had pledged the things, and intended to rodeem them—I found seventy-five

duplicates in all—twenty-one of them relate to these things, which the prosecutor identifies.

Prisoner. I was out of place for five months, and I did not do this with the least intention of robbing—I was going to redeem them—on the morning I went away my master asked for some of these things, and I had not money to get them—I have a little boy to keep.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—

Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of June, 1 bottle, value 2s. 6d.; 1 glass tumbler, value 1s.; the goods of 



Charles Vickery: and 1 work-box, value 10s., the goods of 



Charles Danieli.






JOHN HAMILTON
. On the 19th of June, about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I was in Oxford-street—I saw the prisoner near Mr. Danieli's shop—he covered a work-box which stood by the side of the door outside with a pocket handkerchief, and ran off with it—I followed him—he fell down, and I took hold of him with the box under his arm—he said he had got a tea-caddy of his own—I said, "Never mind, come back with me"—he said, "In falling down you made me break a glass"—he got from me—I ran and caught him—he then took the glass, and tried to scratch me with it—he then took something from his pocket, and threw it into the centre of Hanover-square.

Prisoner. He said at the office I was twelve yards from the shop before he saw me. Witness. No, I said I was twelve yards from the shop when I saw him go and cover the box.





WILLIAM DANIELI
. I am the son of Charles Danieli. I remember, on Saturday morning, the 19th of June, putting this box at my father's door—in the evening, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, I was in the shop, and the box was not there—soon after I saw a mob at the door—I saw a policeman with the prisoner, and the man with the box.





CHARLES VICKERY
. I keep a glass and china shop—this bottle and tumbler were mine, and were taken, I have no doubt, before the work-box was—they were brought to me on the Monday morning, and that was the first I heard of it—I then examined, and found they had been taken from a shelf.





CHARLES REDWOOD
 (police-constable C 171.) I took the prisoner, and have the work-box.

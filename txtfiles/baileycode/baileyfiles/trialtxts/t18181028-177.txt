THOMAS HOLT. I am a labourer
, and live in Brownlow-street, Drury-lane


. On the 8th of October, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I heard somebody in my passage, and found the prisoner there. She appeared bulky. The landlord asked what she had got there. My wife ran into the yard, and missed the things. I pursued the prisoner and overtook her at the corner of King-street. The sheet dropped from under her clothes.

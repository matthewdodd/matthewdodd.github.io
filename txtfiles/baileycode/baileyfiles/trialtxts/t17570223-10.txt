            . I live by the corner of Bread-Street hill. I lost five perriwigs the 15th of this instant. I went to Rag-Fair, and offered twenty shillings reward, to any person that would stop a person that brought such wigs. I was sent for afterwards, and there the prisoner was stop'd with them. She said, she had them of a woman, but did not know her name, or where she lived. I carried her before the sitting alderman, and she was committed.

            . It was publickly advertised in the paper. The woman coming to me to sell them, I stop'd her, and fetch'd the prosecutor to her. She said, she did not take the goods, but that another woman, that dealt in the lane, gave her them to sell. (Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Q. to Hammel. Did you ever see the woman at your shop?
Hammel. No, never. I was in my kitchen above stairs when they were taken out of the shop below.
Q. to Hayley. Was you before the alderman with her?
Hayley. I was; but she did not confess any thing.
Prisoner's Defence.
A young woman (her name is Molly) that deals in the lane, asked me to go and sell these things for her. I took them, and carried them to that gentleman's house, and he stop'd me.

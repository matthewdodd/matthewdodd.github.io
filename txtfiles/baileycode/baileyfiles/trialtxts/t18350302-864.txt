JOHN BEASLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of February, 1 weight, value 1s., the goods of 



Jacob Smith; and 5 other weights, value 3s. 6d., the goods of a person unknown; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZA SMITH
. I am the daughter of Jacob Smith. My father keeps a shop in the Lower Woolwich-road, Greenwich—this happened on the 4th of February, but I was not at home—I only know this weight to be ours—I know it by the notches round it, and the way it is cut.





FRANCES SMITH
. I am sister to this witness, and sometimes I serve in the shop. On the 4th of February the prisoner came in for some tobacco—we did not sell it—I was not in the shop when he came in, but I saw him there—the weight was missed about five o'clock the same evening, but I do not know the weight.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the shop? A. Yes, about half-part three o'clock.





STEPHEN MATTHEWS
 (police-constable R 142.) I received the prisoner from a person who had stopped him—I found this weight on him, and these other five I found at Mrs. Fenton's.





AGNES FENTON
. I keep a marine-store shop. I bought these five weights of the prisoner, and gave them to the officer—they arc pot metal

—I gave him 4d. a pound for them—they are as useful as new weights to person who use them—we sometimes buy weights—we give 5d. a pound for copper—the prisoner said he had found these among some dust, which he was sifting—I knew he worked among the dust—I have bought rags of him before.





WILLIAM DYKES
 (police-constable R 193.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace, at Maidstone (read)—I saw the prisoner tried, and know he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

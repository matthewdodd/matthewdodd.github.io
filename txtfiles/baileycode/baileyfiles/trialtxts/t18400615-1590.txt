FREDERICK CESAR TRIBE.
I am clerk to my father, who is a tailor. On the night of the illumination, the 25th of May, I was in St. James'sstreet about half-past ten o'clock—I felt some one press against me—I turned round, and the policeman had the prisoner in his possession behind me—the policeman came up and said, "You have lost your handkerchief"—I looked down and saw it on the pavement—this is it—(looking at one.)





WILLIAM NICHOLLS
(police-constable K177.) I was on duty in St. James's-street, and saw the prisoner walk behind the prosecutor—I watched, and saw her put her hand into his pocket and take out the handkerchief—some one passed behind her—I went before her and slapped her on the shoulder—I saw her drop the handkerchief—I told the gentleman, and took her.





BRIDGET CONNELL.
I searched the prisoner at the station-house, and found on her three other handkerchiefs, one under each arm, and one between her stays and petticoat.

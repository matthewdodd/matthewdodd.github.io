I am a brass-founder; I work with Mr. 
               
                  George
                   Penton

            , in New-street square, Shoe-lane


; they are brass-founders

: on Thursday the 27th of October I had occasion to go to the privy, between five and six in the evening, and I saw an ingot of brass tucked into a hole under the stairs that lead up into another shop; the necessary is under the stairs, and under the stairs also is that hole where I saw the ingot; I informed 
               
                  John
                   Walton
               



            , and shewed it my master; Walton marked the brass in my presence, and I put the brass there again, and said nothing; we watched on Thursday night, Walton and Mr. Penton, and me; nothing happened then; we watched again on Friday night; and between eight and nine in the evening I watched him; I was going on the passage, and metmy master; and the prisoner was then in the vault, as my master told me; my master stood one side the street, and I went the other and stood, and I saw my master have hold of the prisoner, with the ingot of brass; my master called, I have got him, I have got him! The prisoner was secured, and I saw the constable take the ingot of brass from the waistband of his breeches and the flap of his apron; I observed the mark on it then, which was put on by 
               
                  Walton
               


             the day before; I am positive that was the same mark; the prisoner had worked for my master about two months.

GEORGE SAKER
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 bird-cage, value 8s.; the goods of 



Charles Johann Christian Jamrach; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES CLARK
. I am in the service of Charles Johann Christian Jamrach. He is a dealer in foreign birds, and lives in St. George's street, St. George's-in-the-East—on Wednesday evening, the 6th of Jan., I missed two birds and a cage—the cage was worth 8s.—I have seen the birds since, but not the cage—I saw the birds at a shop in the Commercial-road—I swear they are the birds we lost.





JOHN DOLTIE
. I keep Mr. Culionis' shop, in Nassau-place, commercial-road. I bought the two birds which Clerk speaks to of the prisoner, on the 7th of Jan.—I asked him if they belonged to him—he said yes, he had bought them of a sailor at Blackwall.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. There are a great many parrots sold every day about Blackwall by the sailors? A. I do not know—I have been to Blackwall—I have seen parrots come from on board ship—these were nice parrots—they were brought in a basket, not in a cage.





WILLIAM LEE
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted the 5th of Nov., 1844, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person—he has had three months imprisonment since.




GUILTY
. (†) Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

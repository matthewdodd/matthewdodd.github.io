, and live in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square; the prisoner was my servant
, and employed to take out beer, and receive money for me, and always accounted to me every evening. On the 26th of February he took a firkin of table-beer, and a pin of ale, to Mr. Sidney, No. 5, Mortimer-street; he never accounted to me for it.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not owe me my wages - A. I sent him on Saturday night to receive the money, and told him when he returned I would pay him; he never returned, so that I could not pay him. On Monday when he came, he said Mr. Sidney said the bill was right, but did not pay him.

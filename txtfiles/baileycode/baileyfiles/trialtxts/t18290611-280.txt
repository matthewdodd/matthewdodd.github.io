. The prisoner came and had a glass of porter in a tumbler: I missed a glass the moment I took the porter to him: he went out - I followed, and charged him with stealing it; he gave it me from his pocket - he was not in the least drunk; several other glasses were found on him, or master would not have given him in charge - he had got about twelve yards from the house.
RICHARD LANGDON. I saw the glass produced from the prisoner's pocket, and found three or four more in his pockets and his hat.
Prisoner's Defence. I took it out to put it on the bar.

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Sunday, the 26th of August, about six o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner on Limehouse-bridge, coming out of the prosecutors' dock; he had a great-coat folded up under his arm. I asked him what he had got there? he told me
"He had got nothing but his great-coat." I laid hold of it, felt it, put it over the bridge, and shook it. I saw something fall out with oakum round - I laid hold of it, and took him to the office. I found 3 lbs. of nails in his hat - he dropped a piece of lead. I returned, and found a piece of copper in the dock, under where I shook his coat.

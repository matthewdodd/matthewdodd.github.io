            . I am the wife of William Law, and keep a trimming-shop. On the 16th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, took this cotton, and ran off with it; there was no person in the shop - I pursued him down Cecil-court, St. Martin's-court, and into Hop-gardens; a gentleman gave me the cotton, and I returned; the prisoner was brought back in about three minutes - I am certain he is the man; I had seen him watching for half an hour before he took the cotton.
Prisoner. Q. What can you swear to me by? A. By seeing you on the Saturday night before, in the pouring rain; and then for half an hour before you came in the shop - I saw you and a boy watching me through the window, and I was watching you as well.

            . I am a labourer. I had been to Mr. Baron Garrow's, to whom my wife is laundress - I was passing St. Martin's-court, heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running; I pursued him, and he dropped this piece of cotton from under his right arm - I never lost sight of him - he was taken in Hop-gardens.

Robert Vibart. Having lost four Hats out of my Shop, I went to desire the Shop-Keepers in Rosemary-Lane, to stop the Person that should offer to Sale such Hats as I described to them. My Daughter was on one Side of the way, and I on the other. Seeing the Fellow coming along with a Hat in his Hand; I went up to him, and found it was one of mine. I got a Constable and carried him before a Justice, but he would give no Account how he came by it.

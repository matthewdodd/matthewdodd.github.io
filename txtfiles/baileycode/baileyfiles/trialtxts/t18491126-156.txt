JONATHAN POINTING
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 25.; the goods of 



Samuel Taylor, from his person.






SAMUEL TAYLOR
. On Tuesday afternoon, 20th Nov., I was in the tap-room of the George and Dragon public-house—the prisoner was there—I had my handkerchief taken out of my pocket, which had been safe not many minutes before—this is it.

Prisoner. Q. Was I in your company? A, You were in the room.





GEORGE WILLIAM WATERS
. I am a pawnbroker. This handkerchief was pawned with me on 20th Nov. by the prisoner; it was redeemed afterwards by some one else.





JOSEPH HYDE
. On the night of 20th Nov. I bought the duplicate of this handkerchief of the prisoner,

Prisoner's Defence. I gave a shilling for the duplicate, and went to pawn the handkerchief again, and they would not give me but eightpence for it; I then sold the duplicate again.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years. (The sergeant of Marines stated that both the prisoners had very bad characters, and Pointing had been tried five times by a Court-martial.)

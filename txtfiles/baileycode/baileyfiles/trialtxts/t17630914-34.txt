 in St. Paul's Church yard


, the prisoner was errand-boy
 there about three months, but had been gone away about a fortnight; he had been observed to have a new pair of shoes on, on asing his mother how he came by them. he said she had given him none; then the boy was sent for on the 26th of July, he confessed, as he had spoiled two pair, he was to pay for them, so he went and sold them in Field lane, and that the man told him, if he brought any more, he would pay him for them, so he had stole the quantity mentioned in the indictment, and old them to him.
The prosecutrix's son said, he believed the boy, who was but about teen years of age, to be a very honest boy, had he not been drawn away by that man.

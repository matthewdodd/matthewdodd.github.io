JOHN DAVIES
. I am shopman to Mr. James Davies, of Oxford-street I saw a pane of glass safe on the evening of the 3rd of February, about six o'clock—I heard it break about seven o'clock—there were five yards and a-half of cotton inside the shop, near the pane—I ran out, and saw one of the panes of glass broken, and missed a shawl dress—I looked up the street, towards Hyde-park, and saw the two prisoners standing opposite Mr. Lodge's, four doors higher up—they were standing when I first saw them I then looked at the window, and then they were gone—I ran and caught Fleming, with the dress in her possession, at the next house to the one I have mentioned—she presented the dress to me, saying she had picked it up, and it had been dropped by the other—I immediately gave her in charge of a policeman—our porter caught Keefe—there was blood on both their hands, and they asked Mr. Davies if he would forgive them this time, they would never do so again—the print was not bloody that I am aware of—it might be.





WILLIAM PRICE
. I am porter to Mr. Davies. I ran after Keefe, and caught her in Berners-street—I charged her with having broken the glass—she said it was not her, it was the other girl, (pointing to Fleming.)





WILLIAM JOSEPH ENDERSLEY
 (police-constable E 158.) I took the prisoner—Fleming said she picked up the shawl.

            . I live in Castle-street, Falcon-square. I was between Smithfield and St. John's-gate


, on the 4th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening - I felt my handkerchief being taken from my pocket; I turned, and saw the prisoner crossing the road, perhaps less than twenty yards from me - I gave an alarm; he ran towards Smithfield-bars, where he was stopped - I never lost sight of him; I saw my handkerchief at his feet when he was stopped, about one hundred yards from where I lost it.

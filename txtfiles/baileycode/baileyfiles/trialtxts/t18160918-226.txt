            . On the 20th of August, about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock at night, I was coming along Holloway-lane, Shoreditch


. The prisoner came up to me, and gently put his hand here, and took my watch. It was out of my pocket in an instant. It was a silver watch, and worth about twopounds, He ran away directly; I turned upon him and called watch; he ran about an hundred yards, when he was stopped by a person who could not hold him; at last he was stopped by a watchman.
EDWARD ANSON. I stopped the prisoner. I took him to the watchhouse; the prosecutor charged him with robbing him of his watch. At last we searched the prisoner, but could not find the watch. I then went back to search the place where I had stopped him. I found the watch put on some tiling over a privy, close against where the prisoner stood when I seized him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

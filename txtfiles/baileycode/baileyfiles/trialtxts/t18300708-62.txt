                  Hutton
               



            , in Brick-lane, St. Luke's


 - he keeps the house. On Sunday evening, the 22nd of June, about half-past seven o'clock, I went out, leaving Matthewson and Smith in the house - I returned about half-past ten, and saw a handkerchief of mine in the shop, and a pair of trousers and waistcoat belonging to a brother of mine, all laying in one place in the shop - I had left the handkerchief in my box up stairs; I went up stairs, and found my box broken open, and my brother's also - they were secure when I left the house; I found various articles strewed about the room and a pair of trousers, which were taken from the box; I had seen them a few days previous and had locked the box that morning; my pocket-book laid there open, and two sovereigns were taken from it -I had seen them there that morning; I missed a pair of trousers and a waistcoat entirely.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Has not Smith left his residence since? A. No - I saw him yesterday; I saw my box safe two or three times that day - I have another brother lodged there; I did not fasten the house up.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MATTHEWSON
               



            . I am in the service of 
               
                  George 
                  Hutton
               



            . On the 27th of June I left the house between seven and eight o'clock, with my cousin Smith, and left nobody in it - I pulled the door too, and the spring of the lock fastened itself; I did not mean to lock it - I took the key with me; I returned between eight and nine o'clock, unlocked the door, went in, shut it, and heard a scuffle up stairs - I went up, and passed the prisoner on the top of the stairs; the stair case window is immediately opposite - I looked at him, and he started me full in the face; I am certain of him - I passed him, and he ran down stairs; I looked into the back room - there was a trunk broken open, and clothes on the floor, and a blue coat on the floor of the front room - I immediately ran down, found the street door open, went out, and saw the prisoner fifteen or twenty yards off; Robinson, who lives opposite, ran out, calling Stop thief! I followed the prisoner about a hundred yards, then lost sight of him for half a minute while he turned a corner, and saw him in Bowyer's custody soon after - he brought him round the corner, where I had lost him; I directly said, "That is the man;" he said he could not be the man, and Bowyer let him go, as a man came into the crowd and said he could not be the man, for he had walked down behind him - I said he was the man; he walked down the street- Matthewson said he would follow him; Robinson came up, and took him - I had then gone back to the shop; I saw him in custody in about a quarter of an hour - I went up stairs with two Policemen; there were two trunks in the back room broken open, stockings, sheets, and a blue coat on the floor; two pocket-books laid open on the bed - an old brown coat was found in the back room; it belonged to nobody in the house; I did not notice the room windows when I went out, but when I returned they were both open - they were closed when I left, as far as I can recollect; they both belong to one room; they were not broken - the men must have entered at the door.
Cross-examined. Q.You do not know whether the windows were open or not? A. They might be open when I left - it was rather dusk when I returned; I stood on one side of the prisoner on the stairs - his face was towards me, looking towards the window, when I got on the last stair - he might have knocked me down if I had stopped him; when he was stopped a man said, the man who was running had gone down the street, but I was sure he was the man - he walked very quick when Bowyer let him go.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . On the 27th of June I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner walking at a quick pace; I took him - several people said he was the man, and others said he was not; I am sure he is the person I took - there was a crowd; I do not recollect seeing Matthewson or Robinson - he was about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.
Cross-examined. Q. Did not several of the neighbours say he was not the man who ran from the house? A.I cannot say they were neighbours - one person said he was not the man, for he had been walking before him- some said he was not the man that jumped out of the window; others said he had run out of the door.
JOHN ROBINSON. I live opposite Hutton. I was in my front room and my wife at the window; in consequence of what she said, I looked out of window, and saw a man getting out of the first floor window - I hallooed Stop thief! my window was open; I was hanging half out, and saw a man directly afterwards come out at the street door; that was the prisoner, I am sure - I called Stop thief! another man came out of the door; I put on my coat and hat, which took about three minutes, wentout, and overtook him in Rose-street - he was walking not particularly fast; I followed him till I saw a Policeman, and gave him in charge - I did not know him before, but I saw his face.
Cross-examined. Q.You believe him to be the man? A. I am certain of him - I continued at the window from the time the other dropped from the window; he did not run - the corner of the street is six or seven doors off; I saw his face perfectly, and his dress; he was taken the first time in about three minutes - he was walking at a moderate pace.

                  REED
               



            . I am a Police-constable. I was near Mitchell-street, heard a cry of Stop thief! and took the prisoner - Robinson was alongside of him; I found nothing but a knife on him.
JOHN ATTERWELL. I am a headborough of St. Luke's. I went up into Hutton's house about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner was taken - I saw the boxes broken open and things strewed about; there was a crow-bar on the bed close to one of the boxes - it corresponded with the marks on the box.
THOMAS WOODS. I am a Police-serjeant. I saw the crow-bar, and have brought the beading of the box - the marks correspond.

            . The windows are sash windows up stairs - I had been sitting in the room just before I went out, but cannot say whether I left them open.

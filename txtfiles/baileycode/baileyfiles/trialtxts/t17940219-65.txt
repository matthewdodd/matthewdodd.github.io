             sworn.
I am foreman to Mr. Wood, and his Partners, they are lightermen. On the 7th of this month, I was in at the Waterman's Arms public house, at Shadwell Dock


, a man came in and told me there were two men stealing of coals; I went out, when I went out I saw the prisoners at the bar, on board of the barge, the property of Messrs. Wood and Co. it was laying inside of the Shadwell Dock, inside of the Tier; the prisoners were on board of the lighter, the barge was there, it was laying along side of the Adamant, Captain Jackson, they were from the Adamant.
Q. Had you been lately on board that barge? - I had quitted that barge about two hours, she was put along that ship which came from Newcastle, she was from the Port of Whitby, with coals.
Q. Had any part been taken out of the Adamant into the barge? - Yes, they had.
Q. When, that morning? - No, before; they had been to work a couple of days before, if not three, but I think only two days.
Q. On this alarm being given you went out, how near was this Waterman's Arms to where the barge lay? - The Waterman's Arms is about twenty yards from the Adamant. When I came there I saw two men in the barge, and I observed him doing something, as I thought, it was filling the bags, it was between the hours of three and seven, it was the dusk of the evening; I waited on the stairs till the lad got another boat along side of the barge, there was a boat coming up the river, with a little boy in her of about thirteen or fourteen years of age, she went on long side of the barge, and I saw the prisoners at the bar.
Q. Did you see whether they waited that boat, or called it? - I do not know, the two men when she came along side of the barge, they put three bags of sacks of coals in, I am sure they were half full, each of the bags.

Q. Was there any thing on board the barge but coals? - No, only the Oars that we navigate with.
Q. Were these bags put all at once, or one after another? - One after another. Then the waterman's, boy or whoever he was, took and shoved away from the barge, and was going up the river, the tide was going up; they shoved away about the distance of a hundred yards, as near as I can guess; these two men had got into the boat with the boy, the two men that I saw do this were the prisoners at the bar, then I and some more assistance took a boat from Shadwell Dock Stairs, where I was on shore, pursued them and secured their boat to ours, and lowed them down against the stream to Shadwell Dock Stairs, they had got down about one hundred yards from the barge when I stopped them.
Q. What past when you came up to them? - I told them they had been robbing of the barge, of course I should take them before a magistrate; there was one of the men that was in the boat along with me took a crencher and knocked one of them over the arm, and I said, don't use the men like dogs, there is plenty of us to take them. When I came to Shadwell Dock Stairs, the people that I had with me took the bags to the public office at Shadwell, and secured the men, and took them there the same night. The bags were opened and examined at the public office, they contained coals; I don't suppose that the bags belonged to Mr. Wood at all.
Q. You have not got them here? - No, it is not at all material because the identity could not be made out.
Court. Do you know when you first saw the two men employed on board the barge in the way you have spoken of. It was impossible for you to know them at that distance? - I never lost sight of them, therefore I cannot be wrong. The boat contained no other persons, except the two prisoners and the boy, with the three bags of coals; the two prisoners are the men.
Mr. Knowlys. This barge was laying close along this coal ship you say? - Yes.
Q. These men are men who work in unloading this ship? - I don't know that they were particularly on board that ship, but they were employed in that way. I have been told that they were.
Q. Did you happen to see the mate of the ship in company with them that evening? - The mate of the ship was on shore as the captain was on shore.
Q. Did you see the mate of the ship in company with the two men on that day? - No, I did not.
Q. Till the coals are delivered into the lighter they are not your master's property? - Not till they are turned over by the meter.
Court. Is it your master's barge the coals were taken from? - It was.
Mr. Knowlys. Is it not customary for people to give a small quantity of coals to people that load and unload these ships for their families? - I don't know that; some time back they might when men worked on different terms to what they do now.
Q. You don't know how these men was working on board of that ship? - I did not know they were working on board that ship at all.
Q. You could not get these bags out of the ship but by lowering them into the barge first? - In case that they were the men that had been employed in that ship they must have been gone two hours. That barge that was along side of that ship was detained to load that afternoon, in order to come into our wharf, but the rain prevented us from doing it, on that account we were obliged to leave many a barge half loaded; we cannot go on, because we durst not bring up any thing but what is full pay, if it wants a vat of coals we must not bring them up.
Prisoner Weden. I leave it all to my counsel.

Prisoner Macgennis. I leave it all to my counsel.
The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.

FREDERICK SCHWEDER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
7th of January, 1 inkstand, value 7s.; and 1 ruler, value 1s.; the goods of 



John England Nicholls: and that Manning had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN ENGLAND NICHOLLS
. I am a stationer, and live in Wigmore-street. On the 7th of January, about half-past one o'clock, I went into my shop, and saw the two prisoners there—I had seen Schweder there before, and I said to him, "What do you do here?"—I do not know whether he made any remark, but they both left the shop immediately—I then missed an inkstand—I followed the prisoners, who were walking arm arm, till they turned the corner of Cavendish-square—they then separated—Ifollowed Manning, and caught him in a mews—he said, "I have not got any thing, it is the other boy"—I gave him in charge—this inkstand was found on him, it is mine, and is worth 7s.





THOMAS WEBB TAYLOR
 (police-constable C 164.) I took Manning into custody—I found this inkstand in his pocket, and this ruler he drew out of his pocket, and threw in the road—I found on him this stamp, which I have not been able to find an owner for—I went to Schweder's father's house on the following Monday, and found him—I said I dare to say he knew what I wanted him for—he said he did not—I asked where he was on the Thursday—he said, "In the enclosure in St. James's-park"—I asked if he knew Manning—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he was with him in Wigmore-street—he said, "Yes."





CHARLES HALL
 (Citypolice-constable, No. 230.) I produce a certificate of Manning's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at his trial—he is the same boy.

SARAH ERRINGTON
 and 




ELIZABETH WESLEY



, stealing 5 shillings, the moneys of 



Henry Thomas Janes, from his person; Wesley having been before convicted.






HENRY THOMAS JONES
. I am a clerk, and live in Chapel-street, Westminster. On 17th Sept., between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, Errington came up to me in King-street, Westminster—Wesley followed about a hundred yards behind—when I got to St. Ann-street, Errington said, "Now you have brought me all this way, I am determined you shall give me something"—I said, "You came of your own accord"—she said, "If you don't, I will knock your brains out"—two men popped from a court, and stood on each side of me—I gave Errington 6d. to let me go—I then felt 6s. in my pocket—she asked Wesley to see if it was a good one, and said, "That won't do for me, I must have more"—I said, "I can't give you more; if you do not let me go I shall call the police"—she collared me, rent my coat open, put her hand into my pocket, took 5s., and they all ran away—I called a policeman, and described them—I afterwards found them at the station—I am sure of them—I was quite sober.





WILLIAM WARD LOW
 (policeman, A 238). I met Jones in Orchard-street—he was perfectly sober—he described the prisoners—I gave the description to another constable—and they were taken—they both denied all knowledge of it, and declared they had had no money in their possession the whole night, 2nd had been over the water the whole evening.





WILLIAM NOWLAN
 (policeman, B 56). I produce a certificate of Wesley's conviction—(read—Convicted Oct., 1847, and confined six months)—she is he person.

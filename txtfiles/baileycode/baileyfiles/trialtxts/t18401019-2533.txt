JOSEPH WILD
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
31st of August, 6 towels, value 10s.; 1 smock-frock, value 2s.; and 1 apron, value 6d.; the goods of 



Richard Moss.






ELIZABETH EBECCA MOSS
. I am the daughter of Richard Moss, who lives in Hoxton-market. On the 31st of August my father gave me a bundle containing six towels, a smock-frock, and an apron, to take to my mother—as I was going along Moorgate-street, the prisoner stood in the

passage of No. 56—he beckoned me, and told me to take a parcel for him to Mr. Powell's, the second turning down the street, and he would give me 6d.—I took it a little way, and I could not find Mr. Powell—I went into the shop, and said, "If you please, sir, I want to see the shopman"—I had left the parcel my father gave me with the prisoner while I went to find Mr. Powell—I could not find the prisoner nor the parcel when I came back—I was not gone above five minutes—I am sure the prisoner is the man.





RICHARD MOSS
. I gave my daughter these things to take home—I have never seen them since.





WILLIAM BROWN
. I was in Moorgate-street on Monday, the 28th of August—I observed the prisoner standing up a passage—I saw him call the little girl to him, and she had a bundle with her.

Prisoner. At Worship-street he said it was on Thursday. Witness. No, I said Monday, the 7th of September, but I went home, and told my wife, and found it was on Monday, the 31st of August.

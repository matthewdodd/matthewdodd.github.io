            . I live with Messrs. Bowerbanks of Lothbury. On the 20th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street, near Fetter-lane


. A person came up and asked if I had lost my handkerchief - I felt, and missed it, it was a yellow one.

            . I am a night patrol. I was on duty on Ludgate-hill, about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another in company, at the corner of Black Horse-court, Fleet-street. I watched them, and saw the prisoner following a gentleman towards Fleet-market. I then saw Edwards go up Fleet-street, the prisoner, and the other with a wooden leg, followed him, and just before they came to Fetter-lane, the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket. I told Edwards, he returned with me up Fetter-lane after them. I saw them at the end of Black Horse-alley, about ten minutes after, and took the prisoner, I found nothing on him, and am sure he is the boy. I knew him before - the handkerchief appeared yellow.

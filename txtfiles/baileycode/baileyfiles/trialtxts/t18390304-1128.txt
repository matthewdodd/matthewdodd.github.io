EDWARD BEVAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of February, 1 coat, value 10s., the goods of 



Thomas Parnell.






EDWARD JOHN MAJOR
. I am errand-boy to Thomas Parnell, a hosier, in Blackman-street. On Saturday, the 16th of February, about ten o'clock, I was outside his shop, and observed three coats fall down, Which had been hanging by a string at the door—I ran to them, and saw the prisoner run away with one on his arm—I followed him—he dropped the coat—I cried, "Stop thief!" and he was taken without my losing sight of him—he had only got five or six yards—he was stopped directly, dose by the Queen's Bench prison—this is the coat—(looking at it).





WALTER CRUTCHLEY
. I am shopman to Mr. Parnell. Major brought this coat back after running after the prisoners—it was delivered to the officer.





DENNIS DELANY
 (police-constable M 54.) I was on duty in Blackman-street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner funning without a hat from the corner of Suffolk-street—I Saw him drop something—I pursued him about fifty or sixty yards, and stopped him and brought him back to the shop.





EDWARD JOHN MAJOR

re-examined. He might have run farther than I say—I am sure I kept him in sight all the way—Suffolk-street is the last street before you get to the Queen's Bench.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven years.

            . I am thirteen years old
. On the 9th of July, about eleven o'clock, I was in Henry-street


 looking at Punch, and felt something touch my neck; I turned round but saw nobody; I still stood there, and on turning round my necklace was gone off my neck; I saw it in the prisoner's right hand, and told him they were my beads - he said nothing, but took them from his right hand, put them into his left, and then into his left hand pocket; he then took them out and handed them to another boy who ran away with them; I called a person out of a shop - he said he had not got them, and that I might feel in his pocket - Webb took him directly.
HENDON TREVERTON. I am the prosecutrix's father
, and am a carpenter
 - she had a coral necklace on on the 9th of July; she came home to me - I found the prisoner in Webb's custody, and after he was committed the necklace was brought to me.

            . I am a grocer. I saw this girl crying, she pointed the prisoner out to me and said
"This boy has taken my beads." I told him to give them to her; he said he had not got them, that another boy had taken them and gone away with them. I secured him.

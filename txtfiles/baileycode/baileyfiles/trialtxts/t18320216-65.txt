            . I am a watchman of Aldgate. I was on duty last Saturday night, between eight and nine o'clock, near the Saracen's Head, and saw the prisoner in company with another rather taller than himself; a gentleman passed, who they followed into Leadenhall-street


 - I saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket: I immediately collared him - he dropped it on the ground, and his companion ran away; the gentleman walked on - he was fetched back to the watch-house, but would not give his name; he said he would appear if business would allow him.

            . I received the prisoner in charge: he did not deny it.
The prisoner handed in a paper, declaring his innocence.

1623. 




WILLIAM BOWLES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of May, 1 bag, value 3d., and 50lbs. weight of coflee, value 2l. 10s.; the goods of 



James Thomas.






GEORGE MOORCRAFT
. About nine o'clock in the evening, on the 27th of May, I was standing in No. 3, Oak-lane, Southwark, and saw two men come by—the prisoner, who was one, had a bag on his back, which afterwards proved to be coffee—I waited a few minutes, and then followed them with a policeman across Bermondsey-street to the new leather-market—they there dropped it, and we took it up.

Prisoner. I never had any thing to do with it-if he saw me carry the bag, why did not he stop me—I was not taken into custody till twelve o'clock at night, when I went to get something for supper. Witness. He is the man.





ROBERT ELSTON
 (police-constable M 28.) I had information, and followed the prisoner—he dropped the bag and escaped—I am sure he is the man—I knew him before.





JOHN SIMS
 (policeman M 164.) I took the prisoner on the Saturday evening, between twelve and one o'clock, from the description—he said he had not been in the neighbourhood, but had just come from Epsom races, and knew nothing of it.





JOSEPH BULL
. I am servant to James Thomas. We lost this bag of coffee on the evening of the 27th.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

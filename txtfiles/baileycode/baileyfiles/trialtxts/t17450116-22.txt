Bromley was servant
 to Messrs. Hodgkins and Whitebread, at the Blue Bore in Cannon street. On the 4th of December they sent him to receive a fifty pound bank note; but he did not return with the money. Upon that they thought proper to advertise him the next day, with 5 guineas reward. The same day Mr. Dunn, the landlord of the Cross Key's Inn in St. John's street, sent to acquaint them that he believed the thief was at his house. They went and took Bromley and Newman together (who went to lodge there the night before) Bromley had spent 13 s. and returned them all the rest of the money. Bromley was examined with relation to the snuff boxes, owned the taking them, and said that Newman and his wife told him if he could bring any thing to them they would help him off with it. The boxes were found the same day upon Newman in Dunn's house, and he owned he had them of Bromley. Bromley 

               guilty
            . Newman 

               acquitted
            .

ALEXANDER BEAN
 and 




WILLIAM GINBBY
 were Indicted for

stealing, on the 
26th of March, 10 pockets of hops, value 10l.; the goods of 



William Dunk and another.—2nd COUNT, calling them 1,500lbs. weight of hops.


MESSRS. RYLAND
and
BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN PAYNE
. I am servant to Messrs. William and Albert Dunk, hop-factors and warehousemen, in Compter-street, Borough. Previous to the 26th of March they had ten pockets of bops—on the evening of that day they were missed—previous to missing them we had taken these samplet—in consequence of the loss we gave directions to have them advertised—the pockets had the Excise marks on them—four of them were marked "Richard Stillman," fire were marked "Thomas Haward Peasmark," and one "Thomas Back Westwood, East-end, 1841"—those pockets had the Excise weight on them—ten pockets of hops have since been produced to me by the police—I believe the hops contained in those tea pockets to be the very hops we lost—they have been weighed, and there is 29lbs. weight difference in the ten pockets—the Excise weight on the ten pockets we lost was "15cwt. 2qrs. 22lbs.," and the weight of those produced to me by the policeman was 15cwt. 3qrs. 22lbs., which is above

the Excise weight marked on the pockets—the Excise weight on Pye's pockets was much heavier than on those we lost—nine of the pockets produced by the police were marked "William Pye, Cuxton, Kent, 1841," and the other, "L. Starn, of Leigh, Kent, 1841"—the hops bear no resemblance to Pye's or Starn's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where were your hops kept? A. In my master's warehouse, in Whitecross-street, Union-street, Borough—it is not a very great thoroughfare—the last time I saw the hops was at a quarter before six o'clock, on the 26th of March, when I shut up—I shut up the premises myself—I missed them about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes past ten the same night—I do not think I was asked the time before the Magistrate—Thomas Turner, one of Mr. Dunk's men, informed me of it—he is not here—he told me that the police told him the warehouse was open—it was as near ten as possible—I do not know what policeman it was that gave Turner the information—I do not think it was either of the witnesses—Turner said the policeman found it out when he went first round his beat after nine—(looking at a handbill)—this is our handbill.

Q. This handbill states, that about nine o'clock the hops were taken; I suppose that is pretty accurate? A. That was the time they were seen to be taken away, twenty minutes before nine.





HENRY DRAPER
. I am a brewer, in Oxford-street. I know the prisoner Bean—he came to my premises somewhere about Easter, I think—I cannot recollect the day of the month or week, or the month correctly—I thought it was about December or January—he asked me if I wished to purchase some hops—he had a sample with him, which I looked at—he did not name any price—I declined having anything to do with them at that time, it was such a broken sample—I saw him again some time after—in the mean time I had seen Mr. Evans, and had some conversation with him, and before I saw Bean again the hops were offered to me by a man named Clark—I suppose they were the same hops—Clark told me they were in Bean's possession—Mr. Evans was present when Bean called again—we then agreed for the price of them, 90s.—I knew a little about them, but not much, and had gone to Mr. Evans to ascertain their value—I should say they were worth more than that—in my judgment they were worth 1l. the cwt.—I agreed to take them at 90s.—Bean agreed to deliver them at my brewery next morning, but in consequence of what Mr. Evans said a few minutes afterwards, I declined them—I went back to Bean, and said I would not take them under any consideration.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were not before the Magistrate, I believe? A. No.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. When was it you first saw Bean? A. I cannot tell within a month—I should say it was a few months ago.





JAMES UNWIN
. I am in the corn and coal trade. I produce a sample of hops which I received from the prisoner Ginbey on Monday, the 4th of April—I had seen Bean on the same day, before I had received the sample of hops, at his own house—he asked me if I knew any body in the corn trade who wished to buy a bargain—I did not know what he alluded to, and said I was open to buy a bargain myself—he did not, in the first instance, tell me what this bargain was to consist of, but he afterwards said it was five pockets of hops—he did not say whether he had more than five

pockets—this was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and it was half-past five, or six, when Ginbey brought the sample round to me.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were not before the Magistrate, were you? A. Yes, I was examined, but my depositions were not taken.





ROBERT MENDHAM EVANS
. I am a partner in the firm of Richards, Evans, and Co.—they are in the hop trade in the Borough. I remember having some communication with Mr. Draper about Bean—in consequence of that I met Bean in the presence of Mr. Draper—Mr. Draper introduced me to him—I saw a sample of hops that he produced—the value of the hops that he produced the sample of was about 5l. 12s. the price he agreed on for them was 90s. I asked him where the hops were, and whether we could see them—I do not know whether he made any reply, or whether he said we could see them—he said he had advanced money on each of the pockets—a bargain was struck between him and Draper for the hops—he said he would deliver them at Mr. Draper's the next morning—Mr. Draper afterwards declined having them—I afterwards called at Bean's place, but could not see him—I made an appointment for him to meet me at seven o'clock next evening, at the Wenlock Arms, in the City-road—he kept the appointment—I asked him to deliver the hops at Bardell and Bowden's brewery next morning—I went next morning, and the hops were seized by the police—I did not see him on that occasion.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. What day was this when you first saw Bean? A. On the Thursday, the 31st of March, which was the day when I saw Mr. Draper about this.





JOHN HALLAM
. I am a coal and coke dealer, and live in Short-street, New-cut. I have known the prisoner Bean, as a neighbour, for some time—he came to me sometime about last Easter, and asked if I had got any place for any kind of stowage—I said I had a loft I did not make much use of, in Burrows-mews, John-street, and I agreed to let him it at 3s. a week—on Easter Sunday, I, for the first time, saw some hope in the left—no, I think it was on the Monday, as near as I can guess—I cannot read or write—it was on the Monday se'nnight, the Monday after Whit Sunday, I think—it was the Monday after they were put in my place on the Saturday—I remember Easter—it was about that time I let him the loft, on the Thursday or Friday, I will not be sure which—after some time, I did not like to have the hops there, and sent Sale, my man, to Bean to tell him to take them away, or else I should put them out in the street—I was not present when the hops were taken away—I missed them from the loft the same evening I sent to Bean—I cannot tell the day of the month—I cannot exactly say how long they had been on the premises—I suppose seven or eight days.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known Bean? A. Nine or ten months—I know a gentleman named Callard—I do not know David Russell—I know the Crown—I was not there on the evening of the 28th of March with Callard—I have been to that public-house with Bean—I never heard any dealings between Bean and Callard there about any building materials—I recollect going into the Crown with Bean about nine or ten o'clock at night—I believe it was on the Saturday night—I do not know the day of the month, nor what Saturday it was.





THOMAS SALE
. I am carman to Mr. Hallam. I know the loft he let to the prisoner Bean—I saw some pockets of hops in that loft two or three days

after they were brought in—I cannot exactly say what day it was—it was before Easter Sunday, I believe—I was in the premises on the Friday, and there were no hops there then, also on the Saturday evening after Good Friday, about seven o'clock, and there were no hops there then—I was there again on the Sunday morning, but I did not go up in the loft—I went into the loft two or three days afterwards—I cannot say what day it was, and the hops were there then—I cannot be certain whether it was on Good Friday that I had been in the loft and saw no hops—I believe it was after Easter Sunday that I saw the hops there, a day or so after—on a Monday after I had seen the hops in the loft my master sent me with a message to Bean—I should not think it was the next Monday after I had seen the hops—I did not keep an account how long it was afterwards—I said, "Please, Mr. Bean, master says if you don't take them things out of the loft, I am to bundle them out"—he said, "I will see about it by and bye"—he took me into a beer—shop, gave me a drop of beer, and told me to sit there—after I had the beer I went to his door and saw him—I did not see the prisoner Ginbey there then—I saw him about six or seven o'clock the same evening at Bean's—they were both together—I asked Bean if he was going to get them away—he said he did not know where he was to get a van—I said I would tell him where he could get one—he sent Ginbey with me—I went to three different places and could not get one—just after they left me I went to the top of the street, against the warehouse, I do not know the name of the street, I saw a man named Harris come by—he kept a van—neither of the prisoners were with me then—I took Harris to Mr. Bean's house—Bean and Ginbey were there—I introduced Harris to them as a man that could let them a van—Ginbey came out and spoke to him outside the door—I did not hear what was said—about an hour after I assisted in moving the hops from the loft into the van—I gave them out of the loft window—the prisoners were not present then—Harris came to the loft with the van, alone—I asked him if he was authorized to receive the hops, and Ginbey came into Bean's as I stood at the door, and said, "This is the man who is going to move them"—it was between eight and nine in the evening when we began to remove the hops—it was rather dark—they were loaded and sent away, and I saw no more of them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell us what month it this year Easter Sunday was in? A. No, I cannot—I do not know whether it was January or July.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Ginbey was sent with you to find a van for Bean to send for the hops? A. Yes.





JOHN HARRIS
. I am a carman, and live in Windmill-street, New-cut, Lambeth. I had some conversation with Sale on the 4th of April, about carrying away some hops—I saw him at the corner of Queen—street, Marlborough—street, John-street West, Blackfriars-road—he introduced me to both the prisoners—when I went to the door Bean did not seem to have any thing to say to me—Sale went in doors, and I staid out—after I had staid out a little while, Ginbey came outside to me, and asked me whether I thought it was too late to go over the water—I said no, not if it was all right with the landlord—he said it was all right—I then went with Sale, and got ray van—while I was standing at the door I heard Bean say to Ginbey that he thought they had better let it be till the 'morning, and afterwards he said, "Do as you like"—Ginbey then came out, and

Sale too—Sale said, "Harris, will you go?"—I said, "Yes"—Sale went with me, and harnessed the horse—I then went with him to Burrow's—mews—Sale drove the van, and I staid behind to take some ropes, as I did not know what it was I was going to take—I then took ten pockets of hops from the loft in Burrows—mews—neither of the prisoners assisted in the removal of them—as I was starting Ginbey came up and told me to go the water—he said, "I am almost afraid it is too late," and asked me whether I could put them any where for the night—I said there was the Running Horse, in Blackfriars-road, but that was not approved of—T afterwards went over Blackfriars-bridge to the corner of Faringdon-street—he then told me to drive to Old-street—road—I went there and he met me there again—he said he should run them in there, it was too late to go further—it was a livery—stable yard, the sign of the Leaping Bar—I took the horse out—he asked me whether I should take the horse home—I said "Yes," at first—he said, "Put him in, and give him a feed of corn," so I ran the; horse in, and agreed to meet him next morning—I was to meet him a quarter or twenty minutes before seven o'clock, which I did—I put the horse to—I then went with the hops to Mr. Bowden's brewhouse—I untied the ropes by Ginbey's direction—while doing that, he spoke to me—I did not hear what he said at first—he told me to pull in, and say I came from the Blackfriars—road, and then he suddenly went away and left me—I did not see any body approaching at the time he went away—no person came up immediately after to speak to me, not for half or three quarters of an hour—I saw the policeman in about ten minutes, but I was not aware he was a policeman when I first saw him—he was in plain clothes—he took me into custody, with the cart and hops, and locked me up for eight days.





TRUEMAN MACHIN
. I keep the Leaping Bar livery stables, in Old-street-road. On the evening of the 4th of April, I saw the witness Harris and another—I cannot positively swear it was Ginbey—I am very doubtful whether he is the person, for I did not see him two minutes scarcely—they brought the van in, which contained what I considered to be hops, from the manner of the package—it stood under my gateway, close to the street, all night, and went away next morning—Harris went with it, and a person with him something similar to Ginbey—I think it was the same person I had seen over night with Harris, but I just saw a person with him and that was all—I would not swear positively it was Ginbey—he is very much like the man, but I have my doubts—they went away from my place rather before seven o'clock—the van was in the same state as when it came in over night.





JOHN WOODHOUSE
 (police-sergeant M 13.) I received some informa tion on Monday evening, the 4th of April, in consequence of which I went to Wenlock-road, City-road, on Tuesday morning, and kept a watch on Messrs. Bowdens' brewery, about 200 yards from it, and within sight of the gates—I was in plain clothes—I have known Ginbey some time, and he knows me—I saw a van come up—Harris was with it, and another person whose face I did not see—I do not know whether either of them saw me—I continued standing there for half an hour after the van drove up—in the meantime one of the men went away—I went up, and took Harris into custody, with the van and hops—I took Bean into custody on Friday, the 11th—he was in company with Ginbey—they saw me, and both set off running—I caught Bean, and another constable who was with

me caught Ginbey—I told Bean I wanted him for receiving a quantity of hops—at that time I did not know whether he had stolen or received them—he said, "Very well, I know nothing about it."

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you acquainted with Bean? A. Not at all—I had been making inquiries about this matter—we had pretty good information where to go for the persons who stole these hops—I do not know whether it is the case, that persons who steal things are not the persons who are found with them—that depends upon circumstances—I told Bean I wanted him for receiving the hops—I had information that they were in his possession—I thought at the time that that was what he was wanted for—he was committed for receiving the hops—that was the charge before the Magistrate—I heard nothing about the charge of stealing them till I came here.





ROBERT STURGEON
 (police-sergeant M 4.) I was with Woodhouse—we met the prisoners walking together—they both ran away—I ran after Ginbey, and took him—he said, "I did not mean to run away"—as I was taking him to the station, he said, "It is a very fine plant"—I suppose he meant that we had been very finely planted.





EDWARD LANDSDELL
. I am in the service of Mr. Horton, a hopfactor, in the Borough. I assisted in getting these ten pockets of hops into the station-house, and then assisted in taking samples of them—I have since seen samples in Mr. Dunk's possession, which I have compared with those I assisted in taking, and in my judgment they are the same hops—I have been acquainted with hops twenty years.





THOMAS SEARING
. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Daggett and Harrison, hop factors in the Borough. I have seen the ten pockets of cups in the possession of the police—nine of them are marked "Pye"—those pockets were sold by us to Messrs. Thackerer, with hops in them, on the 11th of October, or it might be a day or two before—I believe the hops now in those pockets are not the same hops which were in our possession—we receive Pye's growth—he is a factor.





GEORGE EDWARD BROWN
. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Thackerer and Co., hop merchants. It is my duty to superintend the weighing and delivering of the hops they sell—on the 22nd of February last they sold some pockets of hops to Messrs. Taylor and Co., the brewers—I weighed them, superintended the delivery of them, and another man marked them—I saw that they were accurately marked—Mr. Deeley saw them weighed—there were eighty-two pockets marked "Pye," and sixteen marked "Starn"—I have since seen nine pockets produced by the police, marked "Pye," and one marked "Starn," which I can say were part of those we delivered to Messrs. Taylor—I have compared the marks and the weight, and am perfectly satisfied they are the same.





JOHN DEELEY
. I am in the service of Messrs. Taylor, the brewers. In February last they purchased of Messrs. Thackerer and Co., eighty-two pockets of hops, marked "Pye," and sixteen marked "L. Starn"—I saw them weighed—they were delivered at Messrs. Taylor's, and their contents used in the way of the business—the covers are my father's perquisites—somewhere about Easter, I cannot recollect the time exactly, I sold fifteen of those covers to the prisoners—I am not so positive to Bean as I am to Ginbey, but I believe he was the other—Bean came up to me, and asked if I had got any pocketing—I said I was not positive, but I would send one of the men to see—one of the men went up—I was not aware

that Ginbey went with him, but in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Ginbey came down, and said those pockets would not do, they were not long enough—I said some of them were tucked in straining them, perhaps if he pulled them out he would find them long enough, if not, I could not help it, it was of no consequence whether he had them or not—Bean said, "Perhaps they will do"—I then went up with them—they examined what pocketing we had, and Ginbey, in Bean's presence, selected fifteen—I believe some of Pye's were among them, but I am not positive—I did not take particular notice of the marks—I have since seen nine pockets marked "Pye," and one marked "L. Starn"—I should say those pockets were in our possession when we bought the hops of Messrs. Thackere—Bean paid for them.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. I thought you said you would not swear Bean was the man? A. I believe he is, but I would not swear it—the man who was with Ginbey paid me, not Ginbey—I believe these pockets were disposed of this year, as there is "1841" upon them—we could not have had them last year.





JOHN VINCENT
. I am in Messrs. Taylor's service. I assisted in looking out fifteen pockets—I cannot tell whether nine of them were Pye's—Ginbey was very particular in wanting them of the year 1841—he was by himself then, when he went up into the loft along with me—I saw the person who was with him below, and believe it was Bean.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You will not swear it was Bean? A. I cannot swear it rightly.

MRS. EVERETT. I keep a beer-shop in Marlborough-street, Blackfriars-road. About two months ago, as near as I can recollect, Bean left a sack with me, saying it was not his, it belonged to another man—this looks like the sack—it was in the same state on my premises till the officer took it.





JOHN WOODHOUSE

re-examined. I found this sack, and produce its contents, which is what is called straining tackle.





WILLIAM DUNK
. I am hop factor in the Borough. The hops stolen were in my custody—I have examined the samples taken out of these ten pockets, and have compared them with the hops now at the station—I have no doubt they are my property—I believe the sample of hops produced by Unwin to be a part of my hops—they exactly correspond with one part of them.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many partners have you? A. Only my brother—I speak to the hops from their similarity—they correponds exactly—I think hops are very easy of identity—this sample—(opening one)—has two sorts of hops in it—it is what we call false packed, consisting partly of fine hops, and partly of brown hops—they were perhaps gathered from two gardens, not having sufficient in one to make a full pocket—it is a very unusual thing to have brown hops with fine—I do not know whether it is unusual to have the growth of two gardens in the same pocket—my relations are all hop-growers.

COURT. Q. Experienced dealers in hops can tell the difference of growth by the mere feel, can they not, without looking at the sample? A. They can—they could tell one from the other if they were bindfold.


MR. PHILLIPS
called






JOHN CALLARD
. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 61, Granby-street, Waterloo-road. I know the prisoner Bean—I remember seeing him at the Crown, in the New-cut, on Saturday evening, the 26th of March, between eight and nine o'clock—I saw him earlier than that—I was at work opposite his house the whole of the day, and saw him outside his house selling goods—he is a baker, and lives at the corner of Short-street, Newcut—I saw him at his house in his business from nine in the morning till nine at night, on and off—it was between eight and nine when I went to the Crown—I was repairing the front of my father's house—I went with him to the Crown—it is a very short distance from his shop, only two or three minutes' walk—a person named David Russell was at the Crown—he and I were both at work together at my father's house, and he went with Bean and me to the public-house—between seven and eight o'clock, I and Russell were purchasing two corn measures outside Mr. Bean's shop—I saw he was at home at that time, and after I had finished my work I accompanied him to the public-house—we remained in the public-house about an hour—I parted with him outside the public-house door a little after nine—I do not know how far that is from Whitecross-street, Borough.

J. WOODHOUSE
re-examined. I should say it is within half a mile.

MR. RYLAND to JOHN CALLARD. Q. Are you a master carpenter? A. Yes; I do business for myself—I keep a shop—I have journeymen sometimes, but not always—I have none now, nor had I any at the time in question—I had a shop at that time, at No. 61, Granby-street—I have known Bean about twelve months—I have not been at all intimate with him—I never went to a public-house with him before this Saturday evening, neither to the Crown or any other.

Q. What makes you recollect that this was Saturday evening, the 26th of March? A. I recollect its being the Saturday after Good Friday—I went with him to the public-house between eight and nine o'clock—I did not say that I saw him at his own premises till nine o'clock—I saw him at his own house as late as between seven and eight, about eight I should say.

Q. On your oath, what was the latest time in the evening that you saw him in his own house? A. Between seven and eight—it was about eight or nine that I went with him to the public-house—I cannot say exactly to the time—it was between eight and nine—I did not lose sight of him from between seven and eight till between eight and nine—he was outside his shop during that time—I went from his shop to the Crown—I cannot recollect exactly the time—I was with him outside his shop from between seven and eight till between eight and nine—it was between seven and eight that I bought the measures of him—we then went to the Crown—I left the measures at my father's house—I was not there a minute.

Q. What were you doing from between seven and eight till between eight and nine? A. Standing outside Bean's shop talking—Russell was with me the whole of the time, talking outside Bean's shop—we took notice of the time by the Crown clock—it was between eight and nine when we went there, I cannot say exactly—I looked at the clock when I went in, to see what o'clock it was—I left a little after nine—I did not look at

the clock when I came away, but, from the time we were there, I should say it was after nine—I think we were there about an hour—I had never used the Crown before—I have been there before, but not often—I cannot say how often, I should say from twenty to a hundred times—I have lived in the neighbourhood all my lifetime, and have been backwards and forwards to the house—I am well known there—a person named Essy, I believe, keeps it now—Maber did keep it—Essy kept it at this time—I cannot say how long he has been there—my father was at the public-house with me that night—he went with me, and Russell, and the prisoner—we all four went together—a bricklayer's son, named George Russell, I believe, also went with us, nobody else—I cannot say whether I saw the landlord that night—the bar-maid served us—she did not know me before—I had seen her before—I cannot say whether she had seen me—I believe she is not here, nor my father, nor George Russell, nor the landlord—I had drank there before—I cannot say whether ft was the same barmaid that served me before.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you ever charged with any offence in your life? A. Never—I cannot say whether Bean knew the landlord, or the landlord him—I have not been to the house since, that I recollect.

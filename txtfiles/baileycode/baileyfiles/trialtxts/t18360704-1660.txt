WILLIAM DELANEY
. I was in Fleet-street, between twelve and one o'clock yesterday. I felt a jerk at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner close to my side—there was one between me and him, whom I secured first, but I saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, and took him also—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner. The brass-founders were passing and I saw the handkerchief on the pavement, it was chucked behind em. Witness. He attempted to put it into his pocket, and when I took him he tried to throw it behind him.





JAMES DOYLE
. I am a brass-founder. I saw the prisoner go behind the prosecutor, and take the handkerchief out of his pocket with his right hand—the prosecutor seized him, and inquired for the policeman—I saw him try to throw it down, but it was not on the ground at all.




GUILTY
† Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

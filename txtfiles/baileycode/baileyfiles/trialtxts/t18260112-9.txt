            . I am a solicitor
, and live in Austin-friars


. The prisoner was in my service as clerk
 for two or three years, and entrusted to receive money for me; a client of Mr. Turner's owed me 45l. - the prisoner never accounted to me for it.

            . I am managing clerk to Mr. Wadeson. Shortly before the 30th of May, I gave the prisoner a receipt for 45l., without date, to give to Mr. Turner, or he was to leave the receipt if it was not paid. He left on the 1st of October; I had asked him many times after the 30th of May to call for this money - he made various excuses, saying, he had not received it; he has never accounted to me for it.

            . I am a solicitor, and live in Percy-street, Bedford-square. Some person, who I really believe to be the prisoner, called for this money - I paid him 45l. - he gave me this receipt on the 30th of May - I think he inserted "30th of May" in the receipt. I paid him a check on Messrs. Hoare and Co., St. James's-street: here is the cheque.

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Hoare and Co. I produce the cheque; I paid it on the 30th of May, with a 40l. Bank note, and five sovereigns.
MR. DUKE. The date in the receipt is in the prisoner's hand-writing.

REV. THOMAS MARTIN READY
. Johnson was in my service—some of my family missed the spoons—I am not certain when—these two spoons are mine.


EDWARDLEWIS. I live with Mr. Matthews, a pawnbroker. I took in these spoons, on the 24th of March, I think of Johnson.

Johnson's Defence (written.) I am entirely innocent of stealing the—they had been wrapped up in a piece of paper, and put into the dust-hole—I had to go to the dust-hole to sift cinders every morning, and in turning over the dust, I found the spoons, and I intended to have got them out, and return them to Mr. Ready—Alfred Bartlett had the ticket on Monday morning, and went and got more money on them, quite without my knowledge, on the 18th of May.

JOHNSON—

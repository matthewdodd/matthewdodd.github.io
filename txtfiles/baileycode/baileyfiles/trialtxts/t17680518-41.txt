            , we keep a draper's shop
 at the corner of Catherine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel


; 
               
                  
                     Anne 
                     Johnson 
                  



               
             came into my shop last Wednesday night, I believe between five and six in the afternoon, the other two prisoners came in immediately after her; she asked for a bit of print for a bed-gown, purple and white; I showed her some, they all looked at it, and did not like it; I showed more; Anthony laid her elbow on a chest by the counter, I observed she endeavoured to take hold of several pieces that lay on the chest that had been shown to several customers that were entangled; 
               
                  Anne 
                  Johnson 
               



             reached over the chest, and brought a piece of print forward, and asked 
               
                  William 
                  Johnson 
               



             if he liked that; he said he did not; then Anthony took an opportunity to get out a piece; the man seeing she had not quite compleated her design, pointed to a piece behind me, and wanted to see that; while I turned my head, I cast an eye under my bonnet, and saw Anthony take it from the chest; they then fixed upon buying only a waistcoat for him, they had a yard and a half, then they all went forward; I took hold of all three, and said they had stole something; the man endeavoured to go away, and tore almost the flap of his coat off; I called in assistance, and found the piece of cloth, seventeen yards and a half, on Anthony, under her cloak (produced and deposed to.)

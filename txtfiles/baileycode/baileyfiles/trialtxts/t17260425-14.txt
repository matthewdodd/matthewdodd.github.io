             thus depos'd. I saw the Prisoner Jones lurking about my Shop-door, and in a little while a Man brought him in, and asked me if I had lost any Thing. I look'd about, and mist a Lump of Allom. He deny'd the Fact at first, but afterwards confess'd that he had taken it, and it was carry'd to the other Prisoner Davis's House, in St. Katherines-lane, and upon search it was found in her Cellar; but there being no Proof that she received it knowing it to be stoln. The Jury 

               acquitted
             her; and found the other 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

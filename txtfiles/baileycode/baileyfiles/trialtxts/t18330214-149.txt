            . I am a constable, and live at No.3, Butcherhall-lane, Newgate-street. I took the prisoner into custody, when he was brought to the watch-house, on the 3rd of February; I found four handkerchiefs on him - this is the one the prosecutor claims - the prisoner said this was his own.
MR. BRUCE. This is my handkerchief.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Would you swear that? A. Yes, it is marked with three spots forming a triangle - I do not know whether it is done in the printing or not; I only bought this one of this pattern - it was scented strongly with musk when I lost it.
Prisoner. It is my own handkerchief - I gave 5s. for it six months ago.

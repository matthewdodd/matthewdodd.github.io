. On the 26th of November, about 6 at night, the prisoner came into my shop, and said he came from 'Squire Allen in Wigmore-street; that the house keeper sent him for some stockings: there were two customers in the shop: I was serving them, and in the mean time he turned about and was going out: I said, I'll go with you directly: he said he was only going to make water at the door; I'll come in again: he did not come in again, and in about three or four minutes I sent my maid to see for him; he was gone: in two days after he came in again with two constables; one of the constables asked me if I had lost any thing; I said, Not as I knew of: I looked at the boy, and knowing him again, said, I believed I had. The boy said, Sir, you have lost three pair of stockings, and a pair of silk mitts, which I stole myself: I went by the constable's desire with them to Justice Welch: the boy would fain have been admitted evidence, but could not, having committed all himself.
Mr. Christian. The prisoner brought these three pair of stockings and mitts to me, and wanted me to buy them: I stopped him, and carried him and them before Justice Welch (produced and deposed to.)

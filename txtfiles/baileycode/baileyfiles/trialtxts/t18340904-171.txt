ALDER FISHER. I am a surgeon
 - I had known the prisoner five years before, at our school; and, on the 26th of July, I found him in my surgery, on my arrival at home - there was a case full of books there - when the prisoner had left about half an hour, I missed the "Vicar of Wakefield," "Cowper's Poems," the "Death of Abel," and several other books, which I had seen there a day or two before - these are the books.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cotton, a pawnbroker. These books were pawned by a person who, I believe, was the prisoner, in the name of John Brown, for 6s., on the 26th of July - I described the person to the officer, and the prisoner was taken - to the best of my belief, he is the person.
Prisoner. I leave myself to your mercy.

, taking them to be civil Women, and when they came to the House they would needs have him drink some Wine or a Dram, and so they call'd for a Bottle of Cherry-Brandy, and drank full Glasses, which made him suspect them, but he would not drink above half his Glass. When they had drank a Dram or two round, they pulled up their Coats about their Wast, and told him now he had seen what they had, they must see what he had, and fell to unbuttoning his Breeches, and in the mean time pickt his Pocket; upon which he demanded his Money, threatning the Prisoner if she did not give it him; in Return of which, a Woman in a Furbelow-Scarf fell a swearing and damming him, and they swore if he made any Noise there, they would knock out his Brains. So the Landlord came and sent for a Constable, she charg'd the Constable with him, and he with her, and so they both were carried to the Compter. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying he came in with the other Women in the Furbelow-Scarf, and went up Stairs, and was upon the Bed with her with his Breeches unbutton'd, but would not lie with her, saying she had the Pox, but gave her a Shilling to fetch Rods to Slogg him with, and that when he came to pay his Reckoning it was 5 s. and he said he had lost his Money. Upon the while the Jury found her

Then they went into the Maid's Chamber and broke several Locks there, took what they pleas'd, and threatned her if she made any Noise they would murther her. then they went into her Father's Room, an ancient Man of Fourscore Years of Age, and threatned him to make him discover where he had any Money, and fired a Pistol at him which discharged a Buffer through a Flannel which was wrapp'd round her Father's Head, and though it did not go through his Head, yet it hurt his Forehead and fetch'd some Blood: that then one of them came into her Chamber again, and took her Pocket which hung by the Bed side, wherein was about 19 s. and put it in his Pocket: that after they had been in the House about two Hours they went away, carrying with them what they thought fit: But she being in a Fright could not swear positively the Prisoner was one of them.

, on the 11th of June
 last. It appear'd that th e Prisoner and Holliday took a Room in the House of Mr. Shipwrang in Water-lane in White-Fryers


, and were to give two Shillings per Week for it; that Holiday went to the Prosecutor's Shop to cheapen Goods, and agreed with him for those mentioned in the Indictment for ready Money, and after the Bill of Parcels was writ out and cast up, which came to the Sum above mentioned, said he had not Money enough about him to pay for them, but if he would send his Man with him to his Lodging in Water-lane he would pay him for them there on the delivery of the Goods; that accordingly he sent his Man along with him, charging him not to deliver them with out the Money; that Holliday carry'd the Man to the George Alehouse in the same Lane, and afterwards up to his new Lodging, which they had not taken above two Hours before, and bid him lay the Goods down upon the Table, and go to the same Ale-house and he would come and pay him, and make him drink for his Trouble in waiting; that accordingly he went, and Holliday after him, leaving word with his new Landlady, that if the Prisoner came, to send him to him, that as soon as they were gone the Prisoner came, and the Landlady told him that Holliday wanted to speak with him at the said Alehouse; but the Prisoner said that he must first go up and fetch the Cloth, it being for a Gentleman who was just going out of Town; that while the Prisoner went up Stairs for the Cloth, she went to the Alehouse to Holliday, and told him what the Prisoner said; and that Holliday reply'd, it was very well, let him have it; and when she came back met the Prisoner coming down with the Goods, who carry'd them off, and her new Lodgers never came any more. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded, that he carry'd the Goods to Holliday's Wife by his Order, and produced Evidence to his Reputation, who also swore they saw him deliver them to Holliday's Wife; and to prove that the Goods were bought and not stole, produced a Bill of Parcels own'd by the Prosecutor; but the Condition of Sale, being for ready Money and the Goods not to be deliver'd till paid for, the Property thereof was not transferr'd from the Prosecutor till the Money for them should be received; and it plainly appearing that it was a Felonious Intention of Holliday and the Prisoner to steal the Prosecutor's Goods, without giving him any Money for them, and he being a very notorious Offender that way, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

The Prisoner pleaded that there were a great many playing at Nine-Pins on the Common, and the Prosecutor being drunk pull'd out a Guinea and would have play'd for it, but no body would take him up; that he threw his Money down, and they all went into the House to drink; and when the Landlord kickt him out of Doors, as he went home he found the Money among the Nine Pins.

It appeared that the Prisoners came to the Prosecutor's Shop and cheapen'd some Yard-wide Stuff, and that Godfrey bid Money, but so low that the Prosecutor's Wife would not take it; that they went away, and Mrs. Oliver missing the Goods followed them, and saw the Stuff under Arm under her Riding-Hood; whereupon she took hold of her by the Riding-Hood and the piece dropt from her. Asbby deny'd the Fact, or that she was in the Shop, and said that the Prosecutor would have made it up for 12 l. saying he could have so much for a Certificate; that he had 4 l. and if they could have made it up 12 l. he would not Prosecute. The Prosecutor deposed that he never offer'd to make it up, but that 4 l. was brought him by an unknown hand, and when he had open'd it, the Person who brought it was gone; whereupon he went to a Justice of Peace to know what he should do in the Case. Godfrey's Sister deposed that Ashby told her the Prosecutor would take 6 l. to make it up, which was to be the Prisoners 40 s. a-piece, and that it was to be carried and put into his own Hand without taking any Notice, or saying any thing to him; that she thinking by that means there could be no further trouble, carried 4 l. to the Prosecutor, 40 s. of her own and 40 s. of Asbuy's (the other 40 s. was to be sent by another) but finding that she was deceived, went to the Prosecutor and had her Money again. Godfrey and Ashby called several to their Reputation. The Jury considering the whole matter, 

               Acquitted
             Godfrey and Smith, and found Ashby 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

The Prosecutor's Hat was found on Harwood's Head and produced and swore to in Court. Delmee said he knew nothing of the matter; Harwood, that he bought the Hat of the Evidence Leacb ; and Witherly that she knew nothing of it. It appear'd that it was not the Prosecutor's own House, as laid in the Indictment, he being but an Inmate; and the Fact charg'd upon Witherly to arise in Surry, the Jury

The Constable and another confirm'd the finding Delmee in the Bed, and the Goods upon the Bed's Tester. Henry Leach deposed that Delmee went into the Prosecutor's Shop and took the Goods.

He said it would be a great Detriment to him if he had not one that Night, for he had been engaged for a Friend for 10 l. who was run away, and could not go home for fear of the Officers; at last it was agreed that he should come that Night, and be brought the Prisoner with him as his Wife, who appeared in such a mean and draggled Condition, that she had a suspicion of them; that she lockt her Doors and took what care she could of her House that Night; but so soon as her Husband was up and gone to work in the Morning, they went away with the Goods: that when the Prisoner was taken about three Weeks ago, she offer'd to make it up.

                  Berry 
               



            's Warehouse under pretence of buying Goods; that he lookt on some Long Ells, and at last fix'd upon 8 pieces, and agreed to pay 12 l. for them on delivery; that Mr. Berry sent a Porter with them and a Receipt for the Money, according to the Prisoner's Directions, ordering the Porter not to leave the Goods without the Money; that when he brought the Goods to the Prisoner's Lodgings, he ask'd if he had brought a Receipt with him, and the Porter said he had; then the Prisoner spoke to a Woman in the Room to give him the Bag of Money; she ask'd him whether he would have it all, he said Yes; for he was to pay another Man some Money; so the Porter left the Goods, and went along with the Prisoner and his Bag of Money to the Alehouse; when they came there the Prisoner ask'd if they had any Boy to go of an Errand, but they had none; then the Prisoner laid the Bag of Money on the Table, and left it under the Porter's care, while he went to see for the other Man himself: but the Prisoner never came back, and the Porter being tired with waiting, took the Bag and went to the House where he left the Goods; but the Prisoner, the Woman who reach'd him the Bag, and the Goods were gone; and the Woman who kept the House told him the Prisoner was no Lodger; however the porter staid there till he sent for his Master; and the Bag of Money he had left, prov'd only some Copper Half-pence. The prisoner had got the Receipt from the porter, and as they went to the Ale-house carryed him to an Empty House in Red-Lyon-Square, saying he had taken it for a Shop, and that he should bring the next Goods theither. The prisoner at first deny'd that he was the person; then said that he paid the porter for them, and produc'd Mr. Berry's Receipt, but was Contradicted by the porter; he also pleaded that it could not be Felony; but a Felonious Intent plainly appearing from the beginning to the end, the Jury found him

The Prosecutor deposed that she let a Lodging to the Prisoners, and let them have the use of a Chest of Drawers, all but one Drawer, which she reserv'd to her self; that going to the said Drawer for her Gown and Petticoat, could not find them there, and looking further mist her other Goods, and the Pillowbears from off the Bed; that she charg'd Mary Pain with them, who told her that her other Goods were in the Pillowbears, and that she should have then again that Night; that she got a search Warrant, and went to two Brokers where Pain said she had pawn'd them, and found her Gown and Petticoat at one Pawnbrokers, and the rest of her Goods at another. Two other Evidences, who were in the Room when the Prisoner Pain pleaded that she and Challenged Pain with them, confirmed her owning them as before. The Prisoner Pain pleaded that she being necessicated at that time, took the Goods and pawned them, with an intent to being them again; and that the Drawer was not lockt but open; that Elizabeth Marshal knew nothing of it.

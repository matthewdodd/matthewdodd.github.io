LAMPITT SAUNDERS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of August, 1 basket, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



James Rous; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES ROUS
. I drive Mr. Kent's waggon to Abingdon. On the 2nd of August I was in Brentford. I had three baskets tied behind my waggon; I passed on through Ealing, and saw the prisoner in custody of the policeman—I followed him, and found this basket—it was one which had been tied to my waggon—I had brought fruit to town in it, but it was empty then.





THOMAS POYNTER
 (police-constable T 156.) I was at Old Brentford, and saw the prisoner run from the footway, and take this basket from behind the waggon—he dragged it from the string and broke the handle—I ran and took him.





JOHN PASCOE
 (police-sergant T 19.) I was at Old Brentford about one o'clock in the morning, on the 2nd of August—I saw the prisoner run behind the waggon, take hold of the basket, and tear it away from behind—I

took him—he asked me to forgive him, and asked if the waggoner would—he said, he did not mean to steal it.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been having a drop of beer with a party, who told me they had seen my wife, who had run away from me for ten weeks—I then said I would ride home—I took told of he baskets, and this one came down—I did not mean to steal it.





JAMES WARNER
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—I know he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

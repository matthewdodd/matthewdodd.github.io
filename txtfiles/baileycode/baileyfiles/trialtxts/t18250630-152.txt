            . I am a butcher, and live about ten yards from Mr. Beckley. On the 25th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another (whom I had noticed playing before my shop) coming out of Mr. Beckley's house; he called to me that they had robbed his till; we pursued. Mr. Beckley took the prisoner; the other got away. When the prisoner was brought back, I searched him, and found two half-crowns, a sixpence, a halfpenny, and a knife.
AARON BECKLEY. On Saturday evening, between six and seven o'clock, I had left my shop for about two minutes, and gone into the kitchen; while I was there my niece said some one had been into the shop, and gone out again; I went into the shop and saw the till drawn partly out - I pursued the prisoner with Howard, and took him - I found the money on him, as he stated - there was a crown in the till, and other silver, but I cannot swear there were any half-crowns; I missed about 25 s.. The prisoner asked me why I took him - I said he had robbed my till; he said he had not - he had been with another boy - he said he was in no employ, but carried vegetables from Covent-garden market.
Prisoner's Defence. I went into this cook's-shop to get a pennyworth of pudding: I knocked twice, and no one came; I went out, and was pursued and accused of robbing the prosecutor: the money found on me was my own- there had been another customer in the shop, but they could not get served.

            . My husband keeps a sale shop
. I let a lodging to the prisoner. One day I saw some things scattered on the floor; I suspected the prisoner had been stealing some goods; I charged him with it, and he confessed that he had stolen a large quantity of goods, and went with me to the pawnbrokers where the things were pawned, (the goods produced by different pawnbrokers, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
"The prisoner, in his defence, said, that they had promised not to hurt him if he would confess. This the prosecutrix denied.

ROBERT NYE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of January, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Henry Eustace James; from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY COCKING
. I am a tailor. On Sunday morning, the 21st of January, I was in company with Mr. James, in High-street, Marylebone—I felt a tug, and turned and found the prisoner close at my heels, and between his legs, lying at my heels, was my handkerchief—I picked it up, and at that time my friend said he had lost his—when the policeman came up he searched him, and found my friend's handkerchief on him—while the policeman had hold of his left arm, I saw my friend's handkerchief in the breast of his coat—the prisoner had Mr. James's handkerchief—this is mine.





HENRY EUSTACE JAMES
. I was in company with Mr. James Cocking—I have heard what he has stated—he has told it correctly—I saw my handkerchief on the prisoner, in his breast, and before that it had been safe in my pocket—we had been walking arm-in-arm till we came to the spot, and then we left each other's arms, but were dose together—this is my handkerchief.





JOHN GRIFFITHS
 (police-constable D 146.) I was on duty in High-street, and heard the cry of "Police"—I ran up, and saw Mr. Cocking holding the prisoner by the shoulder, and he had this handkerchief in his hand—at that moment Mr. James said, "I have lost mine, perhaps he has got mine"—the prisoner said, "So help me God, I have not," and he put his hand to his breast, and this handkerchief fell down.





SYLVESTER SULLIVAN
 (police-constable D 194.) I have the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at that trial—the prisoner is the same person.




GUILTY

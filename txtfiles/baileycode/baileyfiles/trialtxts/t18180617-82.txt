            -the prisoner is an acquaintance of mine. On the 10th of June, about two o'clock, she came to see me-my husband's watch was then hanging up; she took it down - I told her not to touch it, as my husband was regulating it. She hung it up again. I went down stairs; when I came up she was gone and the watch too.

WILLIAM NICHOLSON
. I am a horse-hair manufacturer. On Sunday morning, the 25th of March, between two and three o'clock, I had come from a friend's house, and met the prisoner at the corner of Fieldgate-street—she was a stranger—she asked if I would go with her—I said "Yes"—we went into Greenfield-street—I paid her 6d.—I had one half-crown and three shillings, and other money in my waistcoat pocket—I did not miss that till I had parted with her about ten minutes—I then went to look for her again—I found her, and charged the policeman with her—I told him she had robbed me of 5s. 6d.—she denied having the money—I was present when a half-crown was found in her mouth—I am sure she denied having it.





ROBERT CAMPPEN
. I am a policeman. I saw these parties together—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody for robbing him—he got to the station-house, and then he counted his money, and said it was a half-crown and three shillings—I asked the prisoner if she had got any money—she said, "No"—I took 1s. 6d. and 2d. in halfpence out of her hand—she said she never saw him at first, and then said she had seen him—my brother officer took the half-crown—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.





ROBERT ARNOLD
. I am a policeman. I found in her mouth this half-crown, two shillings, and one halfpenny—when I took her to the watch-house I saw something in her hand, it was a half-crown.

Prisoner. I had 8s. 8d. Witness. She said she had no money—there was 8s. 9d. found altogether.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

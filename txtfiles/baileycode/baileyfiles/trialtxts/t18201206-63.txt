            . I am a baker
, and live in Bishopsgate-street


, the prisoner was my journeyman
, and daily received money for bread he took out. He ought to account every day for what he received. He never paid me 9 s. 6 d., an account of Mrs. Drew.

            . I live in Gilham's-fields, Worship-street. I dealt with Mr. Peacock. I paid the prisoner 9 s. 6 d. on the 25th of November.

            . I am the son of the prosecutor, and keep the cash-book, and enter his account every evening. The prisoner paid nothing on Mrs. Drew's account.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he account to you every day? - A. Yes. I call over the names, and he answers what he has received which I enter, and he marks the other. I invariably give him the book to look over.

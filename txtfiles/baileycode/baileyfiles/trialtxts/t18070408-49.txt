                  Robert 
                  Mallows

Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have a father and a brother in the business, are you not at all in partnership. - A. No.
Q. The name of Bramwell and sons is over the door. - A. Yes, and the name of Bramley and sons is in our bills and receipts, but we are not in partnership.
Q. Mallows told you to search the kitchen, I have heard an old adage which may be applied to this; that were people hide things they know where to find them. - A. Yes.
Q. You have found him out to be a pretty considerable thief. - A Pretty well for that.
Mr. Alley. Do you not believe him to be as big a rogue as any in England. - A. I do not know.
Court. Have you missed liquor from time to time, down to the time you took up the prisoner. - A. Yes.


                  WILLIAM

                  Bramwell
               



            . - A. I lived with him rather better than three months.
Q. Did the prisoner at the bar live there. - A. Yes, he was a carman there.

Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the house. - A. He is a married man, he lodged at the Plough in Crown street, near Soho-square; I lived in the house with my young masters.
Q. Do you recollect when you was ill the prisoner at the bar coming to you about any thing belonging to your master. - A. Yes, it was a Sunday morning we got it.
Q. Got what. - A. A bottle of brandy, I cannot recollect the day of the month; I got up that morning very ill indeed.
Q. What time did he come in the morning. - A. Betwixt six and seven o'clock, he came to my master's house, he said to me he wanted some brandy; accordingly I had a key that would undo this desk in the accompting house.
Q. Did he before that day know that you had a key of that desk. - A. Yes; after he said he wanted some bandy, I unlocked the desk, and took out the key of the brandy cellar; the prisoner took a stone bottle from the warehouse; we opened the brandy cellar and filled the bottle with three gallons of brandy. The prisoner took it up stairs, and went home with it to his lodgings. We put the key in the desk again and locked the desk up.
Q. Where did you get the key from that you opened the desk. - A. That key I found in the bottom drawer in the kitchen.
Court. How long had you found that key. - A. About three weeks after I lived with Mr. Bramwell.

Q. Were either of your masters at home that day. - A. Yes, both my young masters, but they were not up.
Q. How do you know that he took it home to his lodgings. - A. He told me so; I received one pound two and six-pence, as my share for the last brandy.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I suppose sir, not one word of the story that you have been telling to day, did you tell your master till you were found out. - A. Sir.
Q. I have the misfortune to speak low; I suppose not one word that you have told to day, did you tell your master till you were found out, and threatened to be prosecuted. - A. No.
Q. You stole a key three weeks after you had been with your master, you found your way to the cellar where you stole frequently; and now you hope to be believed by the jury. - A. I should wish to speak nothing but the truth.
Q. You know by speaking the truth you keep yourself from being tried. - A. I do not know.
Q. Do you think you shall be hanged. - A. No.
Q. Three months you have been in your master's service, and according to your own account you have been robbing him all the time. - A. Not all the time.
Q. You had a house at Cambridge. - A. Me and my wife left it; there was a captain hired me and my wife, and we went and lived with him.

Q. Did you see the brandy. - A. I saw it bottled off at night into twelve glass bottles, and he told me he was going to carry it to a man of the name of Smith.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You come here to day to try to save your husband from hanging. - A. Yes.
Q. This man is not to suffer for the sake of your saving your husband, upon your oath were not you turned out of the house in which the prisoner lodged, for your improper conduct with the captain. - A. No.

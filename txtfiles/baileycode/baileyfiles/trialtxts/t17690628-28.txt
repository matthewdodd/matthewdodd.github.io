            . I live in Great May's Buildings


. I lost the things laid in the indictment out of my fore-parlour. I missed them on Monday morning, the 5th of June, about four o'clock, when I got up. The parlour door opens into the street, and sometimes our servants leave it open.

            . I am a headborough. On Monday morning, the 5th of June, the prisoner came into a public-house in Tottenham-court-road. He turned back when he saw me. I saw he had the things laid in the indictment in a bundle. I took him and carried him before Justice Welch. (Produced in Court and deposed to by Prosecutor.) I advertised the things, and the prosecutor came and owned them.

I got up that morning to go to see for work. I went into a little old house to do my needs, when I got up, I saw the bundle lie.

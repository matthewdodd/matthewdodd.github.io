JOHN WALKER
. I live in Theobald's-road, and am a butcher. On the 25th of February, I was in the parlour at the back of my shop about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner take a piece of mutton off the front board—he ran away—I ran after him, and overtook him—he gave the mutton to one of two boys who were with him, and they got away, but I kept the prisoner.

Prisoner. I never took it at all—I was just coming from the play where I had sold my bills. Witness. I am positive I saw him take it, and his mother came to offer to pay me for it.




GUILTY.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

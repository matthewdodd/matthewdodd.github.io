            . I am a leather-dresser
; I was in St. Paul's Church-yard


 on the 17th of November, betwixt six and seven o'clock; coming from Cheapside towards Ludgate-hill, the prisoner passed me; he came behind me near the Goose and Gridiron


; I saw him take my handkerchief (a linen one) out of my right-hand pocket; he came between me and the wall; he immediately conveyed it under his coat and made off, upon which I pursued and seized him before he got a dozen yards from me; I told him he had picked my pocket; upon which he dropped my handkerchief from under his coat; I took hold of him and took the handkerchief up; he at first set his foot upon it; I took him to Mr. Willson's, a grocer in the church-yard, and sent for an ocffier, and he was taken to the Compter, and the next day committed to Newgate.

Prisoner's defence.
I was going to Newgate-market to my mother; this gentleman came after me with the handkerchief in his hand, and took me by the shoulder; I thought it had been somebody that I knew; he said, you took my handkerchief out of my pocket; I took your handkerchief, said I, I know nothing of it; he sent for a constable, and I was sent to the Compter, and the next day he swore to the handkerchief, and upon that I was committed.

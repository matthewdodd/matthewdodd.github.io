On the 4th instant, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing down Snow-hill


 to Holborn, a cart was delivering goods at Mr. Price's; I was between the cart and Mr. Price's door: I saw the prisoner go to the tail of the cart, and take out a parcel, with which he crossed the way, on his way to Holborn; I acquainted Mr. Price's clerk, who was in the warehouse: we pursued him, and the clerk in my presence took the property from him.

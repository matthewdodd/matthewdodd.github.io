.
Liscomb Price. About two months since, I had my house unfortunately three times attempted to be broke open, though I am in sight of two watchmen: I was called up by the watchman, and the rail was ripped from the place, but not carried away *; this iron was fastened to the side of the door, the nails were drawn, and it was ripped from the post, but not separated from the other irons.
* The act says, if any person shall rip, cut, or break, with an intent to steal any thing fixed to a dwelling-house.

            . About a quarter after three, I was at my stand, and heard something wrench, and I saw the Prisoner wrenching something off from the post, and the Prisoner run into a court and concealed himself; I went to my stand, and in about a quarter of an hour I heard something tinkle again; I asked him what he did there, and he said, he worked there; I took hold of his handkerchief, and that broke, and he got away, but I secured him: the iron-rail was wrenched from the post, and the nails drawn, but was not taken from the other rails.

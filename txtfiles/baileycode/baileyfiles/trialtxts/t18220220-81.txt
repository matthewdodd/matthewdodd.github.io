, and live in Bishopsgate-street


. On the 13th of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, this shawl hung at the door, partly outside. I did not miss it till the prisoner was brought in with it.

            . I am an officer. About half-past eight o'clock at night, I was near Humphries's shop, and saw the prisoner and two others loitering about the shop; two of them pulled at a red shawl, but could not get it down - they went away, and all three returned in company. One of the other two pulled this shawl down, and all ran away up Skinner-street; and the one who pulled it down, gave it to the prisoner. I ran after him, they said,
"Let the prisoner go on Jem." He immediately threw it down, I caught him, and picked it up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

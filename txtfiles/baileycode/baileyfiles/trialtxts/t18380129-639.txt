WILLIAM MAYBROOK
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of January, 1 coat, value 21s., the goods of 




James Matthews.






JAMES MATTHEWS
. I am a tailor, and live in High-street, Deptford. I lost this coat on the 18th of January, from my shop, between half-past four and five o'clock in the afternoon.





WILLIAM DYKE
 (police-constable R 100.) I stopped the prisoner on the 18th of January, about a quarter to five o'clock, in the Lower-road, going to London from Deptford, about half a mile from Mr. Matthews' house—he had this great coat on—he asked me the way to the Navy Arms, which I showed him—in about five minutes afterwards I heard Mr. Matthews had lost a coat—I immediately went to Durham's, the pawnbroker's, and told them if a coat was brought there to stop it—I went to the Navy Arms, where I had left the prisoner, and he was gone—I then went to Durham's again, and stopped him offering it in pawn.

Prisoner's Defence. I told him I bought the coat of a man going into the country for employ—I had but 1s. 6d., and that it was not sufficient to pay my lodging—I thought I would leave it in pawn till I came back.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

Before Mr. Recorder.

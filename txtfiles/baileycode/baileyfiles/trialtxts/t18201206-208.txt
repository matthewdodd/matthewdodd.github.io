            . On Thursday, the 14th of December, I was passing through Greek-street, Soho


, and felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket. I turned round, and saw it in Jackson's hand, he immediately passed it to Malcolm, who secreted it under his coat - I took it from him and secured Jackson; Malcolm ran off, but was brought back in about five minutes. I swear he is the man who received it.

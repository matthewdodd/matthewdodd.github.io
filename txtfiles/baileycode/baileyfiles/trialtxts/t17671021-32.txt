            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Nettleton-court, Aldersgate-street; I keep a cobler's-stall in Bell court, near Foster-lane


; on the 8th of September at night I locked up my stall, and left it secure between six and seven in the evening, and when I went in the morning I found it partly stripped; I missed thirteen pair of shoes, and two odd ones; on the same day, going about to see where I imagined the thief might have sold them, in asking

                  Bridgeman 
               



             in Chick-lane, who keeps an old shoe-shop, if he had had any such shoes offered to him to sale, he said he had bought nine pair, and showed them to me; I asked him if he knew the people he bought them of; he said he did, and carried me to the prisoner's house, they are mother and son; I have known the woman for upwards of five years, she lives in Long-lane.

            . The boy at the bar brought two pair of shoes, and two odd ones, to me to sell; he asked eighteen-pence for the two pair; at last he said he had some more at home; then he went and fetched seven pair more; he asked me five shillings for them all; I bid him three; I then thought some stall was broke open; he said they came from Ham common from his aunt's, that she used to send up left-off shoes to his mother; I made him leave the shoes at my shop, and go with me to his mother; when we came there, I said to her, here are some shoes your son has brought to my shop to sell; she said, I know that; then she agreed to take three shillings; I put the money down, which of them took the money up I cannot say.
Q. How old is the boy?
Bridgeman. The mother says he is nineteen years of age.
Baldock. They were in my custody in order to mend.

             came to my room, and said, how do you do, Mrs. Brown, do you know any thing of these shoes; I said, I know nothing of them; he said, are they honestly come by; I said, they are for what I know.

I was going to my mother's house, I met a young man in Aldersgate-street; he asked me if I knew any body that would buy any shoes; I said I believed I knew a woman that would buy them; he said he would give me six-pence for my trouble if I would sell them; I took and carried them to my mother's house; I went and sold them to Mr. Bridgeman; I had them of one

             sworn - I am one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street; going along on the 1st of January, my partner and I heard the cry of watch, watch; we went down Crown-street, and saw a woman standing at the door; she said, she was sure there was some person in that empty-house, for she heard them cough; I told her nor to be alarmed; Perry and I knocked at the door, and the prisoner finding he could not escape, opened the door, and let us in; we secured him; he had a black apron on that had a deal of mortar or whitewash on it; while I hand-cussed him, he said to me, you'll observe that basket does not belong to me; I did not ask you, said I; there was a bunch of matches, a wax taper, a pipe of tobacco, a piece of green baize, a brass lock and five iron ones, and a piece of lead. (The property produced, and identified by Williams.)
Prisoner. Q. When you heard the woman cry watch, did you not hear the cry of fire? - A No.
Prisoner's defence. I was going down Crown-street, and there was a woman alarming the neighbourhood with a cry of fire in the empty house; I put my hand to the door and found it open; a man immediately rushed by me, and shut the door; I was in the dark, the house was then surrounded, and I let them in; I never saw the basket before.

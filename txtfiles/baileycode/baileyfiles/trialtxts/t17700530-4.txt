            , we live in Playhouse-yard


. I was gone to a neighbour's house to drink a dish of tea, on Sunday the 4th of March; one of my lodgers came and told me my house was broke open, between seven and eight in the evening, very near eight; I was not farther from home than cross the court. I went, and found the door broke open, and the drawers were broke, and the things in the indictment (mentioning them) were taken away. All was fast when I went out, and I had the key in my pocket; they left a candle alight in the house.
Wil. Little. Keeling has pledged things with me before; he pledged this silk handkerchief with me the 5th of March, for 2 s. 6 d. (Produced and deposed to by Mrs. Wragg.)

            . I am a constable; I had a search-warrant from Mr. Girdler to search Little's house. I found this handkerchief there in Keeling's name, on the fifth of March, for half a crown. The Justice ordered Keeling to be brought before him again. When he came, he desired to be admitted an evidence, and said, he would impeach fourteen. The Justice told him, he would not admit him, he would punish him; then he was sent back again.

            . I was going to a chandler's-shop, the next door to Mr. Wragg's, for some small beer. I saw four men stand betwixt that door and Mr. Wragg's, on the other side of the way, Keeling was one of them; and when I came back again, they were all gone.
Q. What time of the night was it?
Sutton. As night as I can guess, it was between seven and eight in the evening. I saw one of them light a candle I had seen Keeling go up and down the yard before; I knew him by sight.

             bought a candle of me that Sunday evening, between eight and nine o'clock; I live next door to Mrs. Wragg's.
Q. How long was that before Mrs. Wragg's house was broke open?
Watkins. It might be about an hour before I heard of it.
Mrs. Wragg. Mr. Watkins came in and said, it was not ten minutes since he sold him a candle, and it was burnt but a little way down.
Keeling's Defence.
I work with a master builder
; we had a job in Bunhill-row; coming from there one day, I bought that handkerchief, and about two or three days after I went and pawned it. The woman lives but two or three doors off, and had I known it to have been stolen, I should not have put it in in my own name.
Fountain's Defence.
My father keeps a horse in Playhouse-yard, and I went there with the candle.

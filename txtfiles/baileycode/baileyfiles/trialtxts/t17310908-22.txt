            , on the 31st of July
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner came to the Prosecutor's Shop, while he was abroad, and pretending to buy a Stock-buckle, while the Boy went to call his Master's Man (who was at work in the Cellar) to sell him one, the Prisoner took the Cane and went away; but the Boy and his Fellow-servant following him, they apprehended him with the Cane.
However, the Prisoner deny'd that he had the Cane, or ever touch'd it, altho' it was taken out of his Hand by the Boy, when

            , his Fellow-servant, came in Pursuit of him. Whereupon the Prisoner being ask'd, How the Cane came there, where he was taken? he reply'd, The Boy brought it to beat him with, because he did not buy a Stock-buckle of him. But this Pretence did not avail him, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

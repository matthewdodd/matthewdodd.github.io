WILLIAM HILL FLETCHER
 was again indicted

 for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



Joseph Kirby, about the hour of three in the night of the 
7th of July, at 
St. John, at Hackney, with intent to steal, and stealing therein, 22 shillings, his monies.






JOSEPH KIRBY
. On the night of the 7th of July my house was broken open—when I came down at six o'clock I found the door open—it had been fastened the night before—it must have been unfastened from the inside—he had come in through the kitchen window, by breaking one square of glass, and lifting up the window—the glass was whole the night before.





ARABELLA KIRBY
. The glass in the kitchen window was whole the night before—it was broken in the morning—I missed 12s. out of a box on

the mantel-piece, and 10s. from the cupboard, all in shillings—the cupboard was not locked—I had put the money there about ten o'clock the night before—it was safe when I went to bed—no one slept in the house but my husband and myself.





GEORGE WILLIAMS
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was brought into my custody on the morning of the 13th—I asked him what he had been doing for the last week—he said that during the day time he had been over in Shadwell, and during the night he had been concealed about the prosecutor's premises—I asked him how he had lived without means—his answer was, he did not want for means, for he bad lived on the money he had taken from Mr. Kirby's, which he had spent in victuals and drink.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.*—


Transported for Fifteen Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

First Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

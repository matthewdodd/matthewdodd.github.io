1406. 




JOSEPH BUCKLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of May, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



John Smith, from his person.






JOHN SMITH
. I am a coachmaker. On the 23rd of May I was between

Fleet-street and Ludgate-hill, about eleven o'clock—I felt a slight touch at my pocket, and saw the prisoner cross from behind me—I suspected him, by seeing him shuffling something about him—I followed him till I came to the watchman—I said I thought he had my handkerchief, and he found it on him—it was safe a few minutes before.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was this at night? A. Yes—there were other persons going along at the time—I have not any mark on it, it being a new one—I will venture to swear it is mine—the hemming of it is done so particularly well, which I had noticed—I had felt it safe a few minutes before—the prisoner had got about twenty yards when he was taken.





CHARLES HUGHES
. I am a watchman of St. Bride's. I was on duty in Fleet-street—the prosecutor came behind me, and said, "Take charge of that man, I think he has my handkerchief"—I took him, and found it down in his trowsers by his thigh—it was not in his pocket.
(William Lawson, malt-factor, of Chapman-street, St. George's in the East; and Thomas Dartman, of No.5, Dock-street, Rosemary-lane; gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
 Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

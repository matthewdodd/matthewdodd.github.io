Q. Did not you tell Mr. Chapman it might be a nice thing for you? - A. I told Mr. Chapman if I had any share of it I would put it to a good use, I would give it to some charity or other.
Q. Do you or not know that there is such a reward? - A. I do not wish to have it; but if I was to have it, I would give it to some charity; I come here to speak the truth, I know nothing of either of the parties.
Q. This was about the dusk of the evening? - A. It was between fifteen and twenty minutes after nine o'clock.
Q. When was it that he threw away the watch, before you fell or after? - A. We both fell together, and as soon as we had fell, he scaled the watch away.
Q. Upon your oath, did you even see the watch in the man's hand at all? - A. I saw the chain, and not only the chain, but I afterwards saw him chuck it away.
Q. Have you ever seen the watch since? - A. I have.
Q. Was the watch-glass broke? - A. There was nothing broke.

             sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the watch): On the 31st of May, between nine and ten at night, near my own house, I heard a cry of stop thief; I went out into Jewry-street, and found Mr. Smith, the corn-meter, had got hold of the prisoner; I took hold of the prisoner directly, and enquired who gave charge of him; somebody said, the prosecutor was in the highway, but had fell down; with that, I brought the prisoner to Mr. Smith, in the middle of Jewry-street; while I was going with the prisoner to Mr. Smith, Phillips holloaed out, here is the watch, I have found the watch; Phillips gave me the watch, and I have had it ever since. Mr. Smith immediately said, that is the man that robbed me just now; I asked him if he should know the watch; he said the maker's name was Grant, in Fleet-street. I searched him, but found nothing upon him except this whip, which he had in his hand. (Produces the watch).

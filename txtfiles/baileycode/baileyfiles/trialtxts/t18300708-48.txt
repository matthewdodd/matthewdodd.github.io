             - my daughter Rosetta is six months old. I had her in my arms on the 13th of June - she had a coral necklace on her neck, and it was taken from her; I saw the prisoner's hand over the child's shoulder, and he snatched it away, but I did not see his face - the Policeman has the necklace; this is it - I know it by this piece of crape, which is to it.
GEORGE ADAMS. I am a Policeman. There was a riot in William-street


, and the prosecutrix was looking on- I went to separate two men who were fighting, and heard the prosecutrix call out "Stop thief! my child's necklace" - I saw the prisoner running, and pursued him to Nassan-street; I then called Stop thief! and a man caught him in another street - I came up, and found 1d. in his left-hand pocket, and the necklace between his body and his wrist; I brought him back - he said he had picked it up in William-street; I do not think it was three minutes before I took him - he was about twenty yards from the woman when I first saw him running; two persons attempted to stop him, but he got on one side- this is the necklace.

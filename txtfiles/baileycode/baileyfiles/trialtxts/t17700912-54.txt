            . I am a servant to Mrs. Thorn. The prisoner came into our house on the 8th of August, and called for a pint of beer. I was drinking in the same room. I saw the tankard standing upon the table just by him. The prisoner went out of the room before he had drank his beer or paid for it; and we immediately missed the tankard. About an hour and a half afterwards, Pointer and I went to the Half-Moon. As soon as he saw me, he made towards the door. We took him into another room, and charged him with the robbery. He said, though he had been guilty of one bad fact, yet that was no rule he should always be guilty.

            . I was at the Red-Lion. There was nobody near the tankard but the prisoner.

. The prisoner was my journeyman
. Having missed money several times, I gave fifty-six shillings of marked money to

                   Jackson
               



            , who pays my men, lay on the pay table, and I set my brother to watch; the prisoner came, and took two shillings from it, my brother found it on him, and gave it me. I counted the rest of the money, there was but fifty-four shillings left.

            . I marked the money, and bid myself behind the partition, where I had he command of the place. I saw the prisoner come and take two shillings from the place where the money lay.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was dealing with a customer in the shop; I took it to give him change, not to wrong my master.
He called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            . I am a draper
, and live at Southampton. On the 8th of September, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I was in Holborn


, near Middle-row, and felt a pull at the skirt of my coat, turned round, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand. I took it from him, and secured him; he was close to me. He denied it, and afterwards said it was his first offence.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. It was never in my hands. Some men, passed me, and the gentleman, charged me with it.

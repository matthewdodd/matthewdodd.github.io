            . My husband is named William. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment.
Q. Mention them.
S. Saunders. Three linnen gowns, a stuff-gown, two linnen shifts, a cardinal, and a hat.
Q. Did you ever meet with them again?
S. Saunders. I found them on the two prisoners backs when we took them; some on one, and some on the other.
Q. Did you know them, or either of them, before?
S. Saunders. Harriot Hand lived servant with me.
Q. What had she upon her?
S. Saunders. She had a white linnen gown, an apron, stockings, and shift.
Q. What had Drinkwater?
S. Saunders. She had a purple and white gown, a sattin cardinal, shift, and pair of shoes.
Q. What is she?
S. Saunders. She lodged in the house where I lodge, up one pair of stairs. I missed the things in the morning, and Hand had absconded, and the other also.
Q. What day did you miss them?
S. Saunders. On Tuesday, March 31, and found the prisoners on the Wednesday, about 10 o'clock.
Q. What did they say for themselves?
S. Saunders. They both owned they were my property.
Q. What did they say as to the taking them away?
S. Saunders. They both owned they took them; and said, they would bring them every stitch back again.
Mr. Elliot. I was by when the prisoners were taken, and heard them both acknowledge the things belong'd to the prosecutrix.
The prisoners neither of them said any thing in their defence.
S. Saunders. Since Hand has been with me I have found her true and honest.
Q. How long was she with you?
S. Saunders. Not a fortnight, but I had a good character with her. She is very young and foolish.
Q. How long had Drinkwater lodged in your house?
S. Saunders. She had lodged in the house about two months.
Q. What is her character?
S. Saunders. I know nothing ill of her before this.
Both 

               Guilty

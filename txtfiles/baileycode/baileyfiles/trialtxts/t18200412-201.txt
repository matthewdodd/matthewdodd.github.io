            . I am a milkman
, and live in William-street, Lisson-grove


. On the 5th of March, about four o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the area, as if some person had jumped off the rails; I got out of bed, opened my door, and found these things all gone from a cupboard in the area - I could see no person. About six or seven o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner and another come by, the prisoner had something in his apron. I asked him what he had got? he then ran away. I overtook him, and he dropped the shirt out of his apron. I found the bason in his hat, which had the mark of cream in it. He then took me to some new buildings, and shewed me where he had concealed the towels in a chimney.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I got up about half-past six o'clock in the morning, and found these things lying in the chimney.

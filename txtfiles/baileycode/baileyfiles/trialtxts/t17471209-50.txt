            . I am a hosier and haberdasher
 in Barbican


; the 17th of October I lost this check'd linen out of my shop window; it was about 11 o'clock.
Q. When did you find it?

             another witness. He was at work opposite to the house, and he gave notice the shop was robbed. I went and took hold of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Bennet 
               



            , about thirty yards from the place; when I took Bennet, the other had stepped before. Bennet had the goods. All I said to the Prisoner was, that a neighbour saw her take some goods from the shop; so I brought her back, and the linen was under her coats. I saw the two Prisoners loitering about the place two hours before.

            . I was at work, opposite to this gentleman's shop-door; and I saw the Prisoners go to and fro, above half an hour before the robbery. I saw Bennet take some things out of the shop, and the other Prisoner stood close to her, with her back to her, to see if any person came by.
The Prisoners had nothing to say, but that their witnesses waited yesterday, but were not here now.
Both 


               guilty, 4 s. 10 d.

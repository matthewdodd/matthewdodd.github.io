HOWARD HALL
. I am shopman to my brother, George Frederick Hall, a pawnbroker, in Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. At half-past nine o'clock, on the 27th of November, I saw a pair of trowsers pulled down—I went out, and saw the prisoner going past the window, doubling up these trowsers—I took him—when I got to the door the trowsers were lying across the railing, and another boy went away, but the prisoner was the boy who was folding them up when he pasted the window the window was empty, as I was cleaning it.

Prisoner. I saw a boy take them down and throw them on the rails, and I showed him the boy, who was running away. Witness. When I laid hold of him he said something about another lad that lived in the Hampstead-road taking them—I swear I saw the prisoner rolling them up.

Prisoner's Defence. I was not with the other boy; I saw him take them and run away.

Transported for Seven Years.— Convict-Ship.

GEORGE HUDSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of March, 23 yards of calico, value 5s. 9d., the goods of 



Thomas Butler; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE TREW
 (police-sergeant H 125) On the evening of the 8th of March I was in Wood-street, Spitalfields, and met the prisoner

with a bundle under his arm—as soon as be saw me he turned round Red Lion-court, and ran as fast as he could—I ran after him—he threw down the bundle—a man stopped him at the bottom of the court, and I got the bundle—I asked the prisoner where he got it—he refused to tell me at first—at the station he said a man gave it to him to carry—I opened it, and it contained twenty-three yards of unbleached calico, which I produce.





GEORGE DEACON
. I am in the employ of Thomas Butler, a linen-draper, of Nos. 58 and 59, Shoreditch, half a mile from Wood-street, Spitalfields. On the 8th of March I missed a piece of unbleached calico, about five o'clock in the afternoon—I had seen it safe about three—this is it—it has our shop mark.





WILLIAM JACKSON
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I had him in my custody—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.


Fourth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

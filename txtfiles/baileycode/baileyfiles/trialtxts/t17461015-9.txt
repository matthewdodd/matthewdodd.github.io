            ) Do you know all the Prisoners at the Bar, or any of them?

             came into Mr. Harris's Shop; they spoke about a Pair of Shoes, but soon turn'd out, and went to another. 
               
                  Bartholomew 
                  Quickley 
               



             stole the Shoes out of Mr. Corp's Shop, at the Bottom of the Wall. They went into two or three Shops, which increas'd my Suspicion.
Q. Did they both of them go into Corp's Shop?
Kitchen. They were all three in the Shop, when I saw the smallest of them, Bartholomew , steal the Shoes.
Q. Where did he steal them from?
Kitchen. From the Cutting-Board .
Q. What Time of the Night or Day was this?
Kitchen. About Seven o'Clock at Night, my Lord.
Q. What did he do with them then?
Kitchen. He conceal'd them under his Coat.
Q. What Shoes were they?
Kitchen. A Pair of Mens Shoes. I immediately seiz'd him in the Shop, and he said he had bought them of the Gentleman of the Shop; in the mean time he made his Escape out of the Shop, and I follow'd him into Lincolns-Inn-Fields. They were all three in the Shop together.

                  Oath, G


             - d - your Soul, I bought them of the Gentleman of the Shop. I apprehend they are Confederates by speaking in our Shop in such a familiar Stile .

            , one of the Prisoners, came into my House last Saturday Night; she pretended she wanted a Pair of Stuff Shoes; I thought she wanted to steal a Pair; and two Men came presently after she had had one Pair of Shoes try'd.
Q. Did either of the Men come in to ask for Shoes?
Corp. One of the Men ask'd for a Pair of Shoes; I told our Man to fit the Gentleman, and I would endeavour to please the Gentlewoman; upon which the young Man, Mr. Kitchen , took the Shoes from under

            . Ask her whether she saw me attempt to steal the Shoes.
Court. She has sworn she suspected you .

             ) Where do you live?

Halsey. With Mr. Corp.
Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner, the Woman at the Bar?
Halsey. She came in and ask'd for a Pair of Shoes; I try'd a Pair on, which did not fit her; this was on Saturday Night last.
Q. Did any body come in with her?
Halsey. No, my Lord; but as soon as I went to try another Pair, the tall Man and the other Prisoner came in; and Tooley ask'd me if we had a Pair of Shoes that would fit him; I shew'd him a Pair, and he look'd at them at the Candle; he said he was a Piece of that Craft himself, and knew what Shoes were; says he, I am just come from Sea, and shall want half a Dozen Pair, if you use me well. While I was trying the Shoes, in comes Mr. Kitchen, and took a Pair of Shoes from the short Man, the Prisoner: As soon as Mr. Kitchen had taken the Shoes, the Prisoner ran away out of the Shop, and Mr. Kitchen run after him; the tall Man said, What is the Matter? I said, the Man that you brought into the Shop with you, has stole a Pair of Shoes; said he, I don't know any body but my Wife; said the Woman, The Man is not my Husband, I know nothing of the Man. The tall Man said we should not detain his Wife over and over, and ask'd if they had stole any thing; I said, No, you have not, but I won't let you go 'till my Master comes. She declar'd afterwards, that she was not his Wife.

            ) What have you to say in your Defence?
Prisoner. I never saw these People before I saw them that Night I had the Shoes in my Hand. I ask'd him over and over, What is the Price of the Shoes?


                  Q. 
               


            ( to Fool Tooley ) What have you to say?
Tooley . My Lord, if I had had a Mind to run away, and had a Notion of being concern'd , I could have made my Escape as well as the other; as there was no-body in the Shop but he and the Gentlewoman.

            ) What have you to say?
Pigeon. I went to buy a Pair of Shoes; I never set Eyes on them before.

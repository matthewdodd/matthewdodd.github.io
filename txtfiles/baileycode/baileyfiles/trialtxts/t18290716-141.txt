. I saw the prisoner about five o'clock in the afternoon of last Wednesday; I did not know him before; he passed my bar with a basket of linen, covered with another basket; I hastened round, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said a man outside had told him to take it to Piccadilly, and he was to have 2s. for it; it was my property, and had been in the passage.

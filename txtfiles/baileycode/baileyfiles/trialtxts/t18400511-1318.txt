LEITHMAN HOWARD
. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Cannon-street. On the 10th of April, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Threadneedle-street, and missed my handkerchief—this is it—(looking at it)—I received information, and Mr. Howard pointed out the prisoner, who was secured by a Mr. Hoare—I went up to him—he denied having taken it, but several people said, "You had better give the gentleman his handkerchief," and he then took it from his pocket, and gave it to me.





JOHN HOWARD
. I live in Threadneedle-street. I was standing at the door of my shop, and saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take the handkerchief, and go away with it—I told him to stop, but he ran away—he was stopped, and produced it from his pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming over the water; two boys dropped the handkerchief, I took it up, and put it into my pocket.

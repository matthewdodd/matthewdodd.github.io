            . Deborah Reeves is a fellow-servant of mine - I was laying the cloth in the dining-room on the 4th of November; I heard something fall in the area - I went to the parlour-window, and saw the prisoner: I said, "What have you there?" he went up the steps, and ran away - I pursued, and cried Stop thief! a person going by threw him down, and before he could recover I came up, and took him - I had not lost sight of him.
Prisoner. Q. Did I come up out of the area? A. Yes, with this bundle; you threw it on the step of the adjoining house - I suppose you got two hundred yards from our house, but I was close to you.

             is the cook - I know these things to be her property: I had seen them safe at one o'clock, in the housekeeper's room.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner to the watch-house; I found on him a latch-key, a comb, and some matches.
Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.

 was indicted

 for embezzlement.






GEORGE WILLOUGHBY
. I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. On Wednesday, the 23rd of November, the prisoner came and offered himself as a servant, and I took him into my service to carry out coals when ordered—between twelve and one o'clock on the same day I sent him with a half cwt. of coals to Mrs. Matthews, in Grey Eagle-street—there was a lad waiting for him—I desired him to bring 9 1/2d. back, but I never saw him again till he was brought to me in custody—he had only come to me that morning—he was brought to me by a servant of mine—I asked what he had done with the money for the coals?—he said he had spent it, and had thrown the coal-bag into the railing of the brewery—I gave him into custody—I have never received the 9 1/2d.





GEORGE WILLIAM MATTHEWS
. I am twelve years old. The prisoner came to me, on the 23rd of November, with the coals—he asked my mother for the money, and she paid him 6d. and 3d. in my presence—he said there was another halfpenny, and she gave it him—he went away with it.





ROBERT BRITHOUSE
. I am a policeman. I received him in charge, and asked him how he came to do this?—he said he did not know, but he had spent the money.

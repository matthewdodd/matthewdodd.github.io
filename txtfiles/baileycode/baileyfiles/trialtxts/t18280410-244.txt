            . I am an officer. I was on duty in Whitechapel


 on the 13th of March, and saw the prisoner take this box out of a truck, and run away with it; I pursued, and took him. The box was tied, and locked; I opened it, and found a cap, five lumps of butter, and five towels in it. I have seen the prosecutor, who claimed the property, but he said he was going to sea, and could not come here.

            . I am a porter. I had an order from Mr. Ogilby, a ship agent, to go and get this box from Horsleydown, for Mr. Henry Johnston; I was going along Whitechapel with it in a truck - I missed the box, and called out to the people to know if they had seen it; the officer came up, and told me to go to the watch-house, where I saw it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated, and did not know where I was till the next morning.

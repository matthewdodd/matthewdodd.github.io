            . Last Monday was Seven-Night, I was going along Holbourn with a Bundle, between one and two in the Day. I was directed to carry this Bundle of Linnen, to one Mrs Savage's, over against the Watch-house in Holbourn, to be made. I met with a Gentleman in Holbourn, whom I enquired of, and he said, he did not know any such Person, unless it was over the Way. I went up Shoe-lane, and enquired if any such Person lived there, I enquired of this Woman, she stood at a Door, and said, she lodged there up one Pair of Stairs; so I went into the House; as soon as I got into the House with the Bundle, she shut the Door, and took the Bundle from me, in the Entry, and carried it up Stairs; I went up Stairs after her, to see the Bundle safe delivered to the Person who was to have it; as soon as I got into the Room, where she told me the Gentlewoman lodged, she threw me down upon the Red, and then searched my Pockets, and took out two Silver Knee-Buckles, one Silver Stock-Buckle, and 14 d. in Money, and then she went to tearing the Paper the Linnen was wrapp'd in; I strove as long as I could to get the Linnen from her, which when I had done, I ran down Stairs and got away, and carried the Linnen to the Place where I had it from, Mr Peter Keysterman's, a Hambro Merchant, in Lawrence Pountney-lane ; he was at my Mother's the Day before, and desir'd she would let me go with it. - He sent it by me, because he has no Servant of his own. - As soon as I got back again with the Linnen, I complained to him, and he got a Constable, and we went and took her up, in the same House where I was misused. - I believe it was a Fore-room, and no Shutters to the Windows. - I did not cry out, because I thought I could manage her. - There was no Woman in the Room but herself. There were two more below Stairs.
Nath White, Constable. On Monday, the 5th of this Instant, I was coming up Holbourn, and my Brother Constable, of the same Parish, called to me, out of the White-Swan in Shoe-lane, and told me, that the Prosecutor had been robb'd at the Prisoner's House, and that he could not get in; said I, lend me your Staff, and I will endeavour to get in. I went to the Fore-Door, and the Door was shut, I went to the Back-Door, (it is the Corner of a Court in Shoe -lane) the Prisoner at the Bar asked, who was there? I told her, if she would, I would make the Thing up as easy as I could, it was some time before she gave me any Answer; at last she told me, I should not come in; but at length, sometimes by giving her good Words and sometimes bad, she let me in, on my Promise that no Body should come up Stairs but my self; so I went up Stairs with her, I told her the Prosecutor was below, that he had been robb'd of the Things mentioned in the Indictment; she said, no Body had been robb'd that Day in her House; then she bid two Women, who were in the House, look in the Back-room below Stairs, and when they mov'd a Chair or two, one of the Knee-buckles, and the Stock buckle lay under the Chair, upon the Ground. I am not positive whether I took them up, or not, or who did; they are ready to be produc'd in Court, and Smith will prove them to be his.
Smith. These are mine, this Knee-buckle, and the Stock-buckle.
White. I called in the Prosecutor, and asked him, which was the Person that robb'd him? And he pointed immediately to the Prisoner at the Bar, and said, that was the Woman that robb'd him; and then he charged the Prisoner at the Bar, and two others, and sent them to the Compter.
2. Why did he send them to the Compter?
White. Because he did not know but they might be aiding, or assisting, or have the other Buckle.
Prisoner. There was me and two more Women in Company, I did not touch them. This is a persidious Case, when you know [to the Constable] what pasied between you and I in the Back-room; the Boy came to the Door, and asked for a Dram, I thought such Boys had no occasion for Drams; I said to him, prithee, Boy, go about your Business; says one of the Women, let the Boy have a Dram, and so I did, and he gave me 2 d. for it, and the Boy went into the Back room with them about 11 o'Clock.

             was call'd again, and asked, whether he did go into the Back-room with these Women? He said, No, my Lord, I do assure you I did not.
Prisoner. This is all Spight in the Constable. This is not my House, it is my Sister's House,

White. Her Name is in the Parish Books, and it is generally reputed to be her House. 


               Guilty of the Felony, and acquitted of putting him in Fear
            .

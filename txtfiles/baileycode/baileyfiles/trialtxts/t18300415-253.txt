            . I am a Thames Police-constable. On the 18th of March I was in Rosemary-lane; I saw the two prisoners in company - Morgan was carrying this bundle under his apron; I asked what he had there - he said, some stockings, which a person employed him to sell for him - I told him to show me the person; I went with them down the lane, and then they said it was of no use telling a lie about it, and Williams added, "We stole them out of Cheapside."

            , a hosier, in Cheapside. These are his property, and were missed, on the 18th of March, from a stool near the door, in our shop - there are twelve pairs tied up, and they have our mark on them; I did not see the prisoners.
Morgan's Defence. I was in distress, through my master being a bankrupt.

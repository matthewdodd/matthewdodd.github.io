. On the 1st of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and asked to see some lace; I shewed her a drawer, and observed her conceal a piece under her shawl; I continued to shew her more, and saw her conceal another piece in the same way; she offered me a price which I could not take, and wished me good night; I followed her out, and charged her with it, which she denied; I brought her back; she put her hand under her shawl, and threw both the cards of lace up; one fell on the counter, and the other on the floor.

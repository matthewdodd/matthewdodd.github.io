                  JEREMIAH 
                  MACDONALD
               



            . I am an insurance-broker
, and live on Windsor-terrace, City-road. On the 20th of November I had been to the Guildhall Coffee-house: I left it about twelve o'clock - I was much the worse for liquor. After I had passed Finsbury-square



, a woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner, Harriet Phillips, came up to me laid hold of my arm, and wanted me to go home with her - She remained about eight minutes with me. I had a gold watch, worth 20l., two seals, worth 4l., and a reading-glass. As soon as I got home I missed them. The ring of the chain had been fastened to the button of my waistcoat. I found the button undone-it must have been taken with great violence. I saw the watch again on the Tuesday after in possession of Creswell, the officer. I saw a man, whom I believe to be Leonard Phillips, near the prisoner, Harriet Phillips; immediately as she left me she went to him.
RICHARD HORPWOOD. I am a watch-maker, and live in Worship-street. The prisoner, 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Phillips
               



            , came to my shop on the 20th of November, at ten o'clock in the morning, and asked for a watch-glass, and produced a gold watch - She asked the value of it? I told her I could not tell the value without weighing the case. I suspected it had been improperly come by-it was worth 12l. or 15l. I made an excuse that I did not know the value of it, and would go to a neighbour's. She waited in the shop. I got an officer - I detained her till he came, and secured her. I asked how she got it? she said it was in pledge for 1l., and she took it out of pledge, in Barbican, that morning, for a girl of the town.
LEONARD MATHEWS. My father is a pawnbroker, and lives in Whitecross-street. I have a gold seal, which I took in pledge of the prisoner, Harriet Phillips, on Thursday, the 20th of November, a little before nine o'clock in the morning - I am sure she is the woman. I advanced 7s. on it. On that day week the prosecutor saw it and claimed it.


                  JOHN 
                  WALKER
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Mathews. I took the glass in pledge on the 20th of November, for 2s., of 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Phillips
               



            .


                  JOHN 
                  ASTON
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitecross-street. On the 20th of November, at nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Phillips
               



            , pledged a watch-chain with me - She was ten or twelve minutes in my shop - She said she would redeem it in half an hour. On the same day I heard it had been stolen; the prosecutor claimed it. I advanced 1l. 10s. on it.


                  JOHN 
                  CRESSWELL
               



            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 20th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was going down Worship-street, Mance met me, and asked me to go with him. We went to Horpwood's shop-door, and saw the two male prisoners standing by the shop, about thirty or forty yards off. I told Mance to go into the shop, and take Harriet Phillips. I went up, and asked 
               
                  Leonard 
                  Phillips
               



             what he was standing there for? he said he was waiting for the young man, pointing to Blake. I asked him if he was not waiting for a young woman? he said, Yes. I took them both to Horpwood's shop, and asked the woman if she knew them? she said she did very well, for one was her husband, andthe other was her son. I asked her how she came by the gold watch? she said, she had bought it that morning, for 1l., of a woman of the town, and borrowed part of the money to pay for it. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ingram
               



             was produced to her - She denied it, and the prisoner said that was not the woman that she meant. I took them all into custody. I saw Mance find a pocket-book on Leonard Phillips.


                  THOMAS 
                  MANCE
               



            . I am an officer. I saw the male prisoners about thirty yards from the shop. I apprehended the woman in the shop, and asked her where she got the watch? she said she bought the duplicate of a woman, of the name of Ingram, in Chequer-alley, for 1l., and that the watch was in pledge for 1l., at Burrows's, the pawnbroker, in Barbican - I went there. Ingram was produced, and denied receiving it - She said, she was not the woman. I could find no other woman of that name. I found a 1l. note on 
               
                  Leonard 
                  Phillips
               



            , also a gold seal on Blake, and several duplicates, one was for a seal, pledged with Mathews that day, in the name of Mary Brown-another for a gold chain, pledged that day in Whitecross-street, in the name of 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Brown
               



            -one for a glass, pledged with Mathews for 2s., in the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown
               



            . The prosecutor claimed the seal which was found on Blake. I found part of a gold key, with the pipe, on the female prisoner-the pipe fits the remaining part of the key which was with the chain.


                  LEONARD 
                  MATHEWS
               



            . The duplicate of the seal is that which I gave her.

            . The duplicate of the glass is the one I gave her.

                  ASTON
               



            . The duplicate of the watch-chain is the one I gave her.

                  PHILLIPS
               



            'S Defence. A woman, who said her name was Ingram, came to my bed-room, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and said she had a watch in pledge, and sold me the duplicate - I gave her 1l. 8s.; she went and got it out. She sent me to pledge a seal for her. I went in to get a glass for the watch-when I came out I could not find her.

            'S Defence. The woman said she bought it, and I went with her.
BLAKE'S Defence. I met my mother, and went with her to pledge it.

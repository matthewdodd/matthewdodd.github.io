ELI READ. I live at Margate. I was in Holborn


 on the 9th of November, about twelve o'clock - I felt some person touch my left-hand breeches pocket, in which I had 90l.; I turned round, and saw the prisoner near me, and said, "What do you want with my pocket," as I was fearful he had taken my money, but he had not. The officer came up, and took his hand out of his pantaloons, and he had my handkerchief in it - he said he had found it - it was safe in my coat pocket just before.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner by the collar - I went up and took him, and found the handkerchief in his hand.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was eight or nine yards behind the gentleman, and saw this handkerchief on the curb; I picked it up, and put it into my pocket: I wanted to pass the prosecutor, who was walking with a lady, rather slowly, and in passing I touched the lady's heel; she turned round; the gentleman said I had robbed him - I said I had found a handkerchief, and if it was his he might have it; the officer came up, and insisted upon his giving charge of me.

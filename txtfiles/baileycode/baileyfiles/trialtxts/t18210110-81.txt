            . On Sunday afternoon, the 7th of January, about three o'clock, I and a young man were coming from Wimpole-street; two lads followed us to St. Martin's-court


. I felt the skirt of my great-coat lifted up, missed my handkerchief, and saw the prisoner walking away very quick. I followed, and saw him folding it up; he ran off and threw it down; he struck me and cut my lip, which bled profusely. A gentleman stopped him in Earls-court. I am sure he is the boy.

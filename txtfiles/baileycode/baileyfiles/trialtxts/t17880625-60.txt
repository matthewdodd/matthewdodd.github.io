I live in Tottenham-court-road


; on Whitsun Monday I was going home with a shirt and handkerchief of my brother's, tied up in a handkerchief; I called down the area to my brother to open the door, the prisoner was standing at the rails of the next area, he came behind me and snatched the bundle from under my arm, and ran away.
Did he say any thing to you? - No, he neither spoke to me, nor touched me, it was so sudden, I had no time to lay hold of him or make any resistance; my brother came out, and we both gave an alarm, and he was pursued and brought back.
Are you certain the prisoner is the man? - I am very certain of it.
Do you know that there is a reward on the conviction of a man for a highway robbery? - There was a man at the watch-house told me there was 40 l. reward for a highway robbery, but that there was nothing for stealing.
Who was it that told you so? - I don't know who he was.

             sworn.
I opened the door to let my sister in, and saw the prisoner run across the way with the bundle, I pursued him and never lost sight of him, till he was stopped.
Are you certain of that? - Yes.
What became of the bundle? - I saw him throw it away, it was afterwards picked up by a person in the mob, and carried to the watch-house.

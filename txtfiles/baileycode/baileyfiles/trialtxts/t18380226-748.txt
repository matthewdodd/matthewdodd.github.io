JOHN TAYLOR
 (police-constable E 31.) About four o'clock, in the afternoon of the 10th of February, I saw the prisoner in the street—he had something in his jacket-pockets—I went and asked him what he had—he said, nothing that he was afraid of; he would show me if I chose—I told him it might remove suspicion if he did—he then pulled out a pint pot—I asked him who it belonged to—he said, "The Devonshire Arms, Duke-street"—I took him there, and asked the landlord if he knew him—he said he knew nothing of him, but the pot belonged to Mr. Helling, of the White Swan—I took him there, and asked what he had in his other pocket—he said, "Another like it"—Mr. Helling identified the pots as his.





ROBERT HELLING
. I keep the White Swan, in Great Portland-street These pots are mine, but I do not know the prisoner—he had no right to my pots at all.

Prisoner. The pots were in the street—I was going to take them home as soon as I had been to another place.

Mr. Gurney. (To Provost.) Q. In what situation of life are you? - A. A cooper.
Q. You are the father of the second wife? - A. Yes.
Q. Your daughter had no great fortune, I believe, and therefore he could not marry her for that?- A. No.

                  JOHN 
                  PULLEN
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley.
Q. Be so good as explain this transaction of which we have heard? - A. When the prisoner was apprehended for this offence, I waited upon him at the prison; he seemed very much disposed to make every attonement in his power; and I was equally induced to obviate the necessity of prosecution.
Court. Q. Are you an attorney? - A. Yes.
Q. Do not you know that the offence, with which he was charged, was a selony; and that that was a composition of felony? - A. I was not fully aware of it; I drew up the memorandum, and put it into the form of a bond immediately afterwards; I was extremely anxious to prevent a prosecution.
Q. Do you see the situation in which you have placed yourself; you, a professional man, have been actually compounding felony; you could not appear in a situation less respectable.
Mr. Pullen. A.Being very little conversant with this sort of business, I acted more agreeable to my feelings than any thing else; that is the only extenuation I can offer for my conduct.
Mr. Gurney. Q. Who is this 
               
                  William 
                  Provost
               



            , that appears as a witness to both these instruments?- A. The son of 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Provost
               



            ; the prisoner said he had so great an affection for that last wife, that he should be very happy to make her every reparation he could possibly make.
The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.
Mr. Gurney. I believe I can put an end to all this, which, in such a case, nobody will be very sorry for; I will shew that the first was not a legal marriage, he being a minor.
For the prisoner.
 - COLLINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a brewer, at Richmond: I have known the prisoner these twelve years.
Q. Did you know him in 1795, at which time he is said to have married? - A. He was at that time but just come from abroad; I knew him in 1789, 1790, 1791, and 1792.
Q. Do you know what age he is now? - A. I cannot say, I think twenty-eight.
Q. Don't you know at all what age he is of now?- A. No.
Q. Is he not a young man of exceeding good character? - A. Yes; but he has been very easily persuaded to a great many things that he ought not have been.

            . I am a carpenter
; I lost my saws on the 15th or 16th of September, from a new building I was at work upon, in PoorJewry lane


; they were taken away whilst I was at dinner. I was sent for to the Mansion-house; there I saw my saws.

            . I was at dinner in a public house; I saw the prisoner walk by the buildings; he came back again, and took a tenant saw from a nail, and a hand saw from a bench; I went up to him and stopt him; he had the saws on his arm. I took him to a constable. (The saws produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was really in want, and had been ill a great while; I did it through necessity; I am a carpenter
.

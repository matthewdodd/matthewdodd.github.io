            . I am an iron-monger and founder
. The goods found upon the prisoner are my property. My servant can give a farther account.

            . I am servant to Mr. Jenkins. The prisoner came into our shop on the 14th of this instant, under pretence of wanting business. I told him my master was gone to dinner, and if he would call again in about two hours time, he might talk to him. I went up stairs. The prisoner went out, and came back again, and wrote directions to know where to come. Then I went up to dinner. Then he came back again and told the errand boy he wanted to speak with me; as the boy was coming to me, he ran out, and the boy after him; the boy soon return'd, and said the prisoner had struck him. I ran out, and in Warwick-Lane stop'd the prisoner with the goods under his arm. I challenged them; then he said if these are your goods, take them; which I did (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing concerning the affair, I was very much in liquor; and know no more that I took any thing away than he that is unborn.
Q. to Hopkins. Was the prisoner in liquor ?
Hopkins. He was a little in liquor, but not so much but he knew what he did.




               Guilty 10 d.

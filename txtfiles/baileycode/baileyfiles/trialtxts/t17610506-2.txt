Thomas Archer. I live at Hitchin in Hertfordshire, I am a carpenter
, I lost a saddle from the Golden Lion in St. John's-street


 some time in March last; I lay there that night, and missed it the next morning out of the stable, when I went in to see my horse; it was what we call a neat's leather saddle.
Q. Did you ever see it again?
Archer. I did at justice Welch's. ( Produced in court, and deposed to) The prisoner was there, and upon being asked where he had it, he said he had it from the Golden Lion in St. John's-street.

                  Smith 
               



            . I keep a publick-house in Cow-cross, the prisoner offered to sell a saddle one night in the street at my door, about nine or ten o'clock. I said, Don't buy it, you know him to be a thief, and was transported for such an affair before; (See No. 377 in Mr. Alderman Alsop's mayoralty) then he ran down the street, and threw the saddle away behind a door; he was taken, and the next morning he owned he took it out of Mr. Fish's stable, at the Golden Lion in St. John's-street.
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the saddle, but did not offer it to sell to any-body.



               Guilty
            .

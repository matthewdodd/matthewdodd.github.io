HANNAH EDWARDS
. I am the wife of Edward Edwards, and live in Prospect-place, Kentish-town. On the 9th of August, I left my front parlour window a little way open—I hung a blanket en a chair at the foot of the bed, within reach of the window—I missed it, and found it in the policeman's possession.





SARAH BACON
. I am the wife of James Bacon, and live at Mrs. Edwards's. On the 9th of August, I was looking out of window, and saw the prisoner carrying a bag and matches—he asked if I wanted any—I noticed that a garden pot was moved from the window—I went down and spoke to Mrs. Edwards—I then ran out and found the prisoner walking down the lane—he threw the blanket out of his bag on seeing me, and I took it up.





EDMUND JOHNSON
. I followed the prisoner and saw him drop the blanket—I stopped him and held him till Eaton came.





JOHN EATON
. I took the prisoner in charge—I found a silver spoon, an umbrella, a work-box, and other things in his bag.

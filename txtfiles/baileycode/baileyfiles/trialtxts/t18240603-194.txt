            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 20th of April, about one o'clock I was coming through Smithfield and saw the prisoners - they followed a gentleman up Cloth-fair into Long-lane - I saw Neal take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket and give it to Greenwood, who put it into his breast - I seized them, and took it from Greenwood's breast - Newton ran after the gentleman but he would have nothing to do with it.

            . I have heard Waddington's evidence; it is correct - I did not see the handkerchief taken, but saw him take it from Greenwood's breast.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of information, I went to a house in James-street, in Mile End Old Town; there was no number on the house; that house turned out to belong to the prisoner; he was not at home at first; but afterwards when he was, we went again, and he threw up the window, to get out; but seeing Crosswell outside, he made no farther attempt. We found the property in question there.

JOSEPH HARRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



William Hall, from his person.






WILLIAM HALL
. I have been at sea, but am now living at Scarborough, and am a ship-owner. On the 8th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was walking in Cornhill—I felt my pocket lightened—I turned round, and then observed the prisoner close behind me, with my handkerchief in his hand, which he instantly threw away—I took it up, and attempted to take him, but he got from me, and ran off—a policeman pursued him—I lost sight of him, but he was taken almost immediately—I have not the slightest doubt but he is the man—this is my handkerchief—it has my mark on it.


Prisoner. Q. Could you swear I was the man? A. Yes.





EDWARD CRANE
 (City police-constable. No. 335.) I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling—before I could get up the prisoner broke away, and ran round the Exchange till he got to a court where there is no thoroughfare, and I took him—I had not lost sight of him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along Cornhill; there were two or three gentlemen; I saw the handkerchief on the pavement, and one of them took hold of me; I tried to get away.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

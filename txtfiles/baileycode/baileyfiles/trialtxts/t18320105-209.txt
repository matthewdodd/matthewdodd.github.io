s, of Lamb's Conduit-street


. On the 5th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoners lurking about the door - Owen came up on the step, pulled down a cloak, and gave it to Power, who put it into his apron, and ran away with it; I ran and caught Power with it - I took him back to the shop, then ran after Owen, and took him; I gave them both into custody - I am certain of them.
WILLIAM -. I am a Police-constable. I received the prisoners and this cloak.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Owen's Defence. I had nothing to do with the cloak, and never saw this boy till I was taken into the shop.
Power's Defence. I was going down the street, and swung my arm; the cloak being slightly hung up, came down, and this man said I took it.
MR. BULL. He had got above one hundred yards off; I had seen them some time - Owen came on the step, took it down, and gave it him.
OWEN - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 14.
POWER - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 12.

William Bowdler. I am acarpenter
. The prisoner came into my shop, and took out a jack plane and an oil stone, about one o'clock at noon. My next door neighbour told me the prisoner had taken something out of my shop. I live near the Cock in the Corner. I ran after him up the Old Bailey, and near Surgeons Hall I took him, and found them both upon him. I carried him before the sitting alderman. He said he asked one of the men for them as he knew. I had no man at home at that time.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going there, and met a carpenter; I asked him to lend me a plane and oil stone. He told me to take them, but bring them home at night. The man's name that I met is 
               
                  William 
                  Newman 
               



            : he told me he was at work there.




               Guilty 10 d.

THOMAS STEELE. I am a porter, and live in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On the 8th of April, I was going along Wimpole-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner, who threw from under his apron a roll of silk; a gentleman ran after him, and called to another person, who stopped him in my sight - the silk was taken up by a gentleman who was following, and he gave it to the officer.
JOHN LEGG (Police-constable D 149.) I saw the prisoner in custody of a gentleman in Wigmore-street; he delivered him to me, with this silk.
RICHARD NELMS. I am a mercer
, and live in Oxford-street


. This silk is mine; I had it safe on the morning of the 8th of April - the officer came about one o'clock, and then I looked and missed it; it has my mark on the end of the roll.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing up Oxford-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, and a person threw this down at my feet, and the gentleman took me.
JURY to JOHN LEGG. Q. How far was the prisoner from the prosecutor's? A. About two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards; there was a shop bill on the paper, which the prisoner tore to pieces.

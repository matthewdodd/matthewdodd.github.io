            . I am apprentice to Mr. Allen; the last Witness said, the Prisoner had taken a bar of iron out of the shop, I followed him directly; he went through Great Moregate, and took his way up into an inn joining to the Gate; I took him with the bar of iron upon his shoulder; and he said, he never did such a thing in his life before.
Prisoner. A man called me to carry a bar of iron for him, and they stopped me, and said it was theirs.
Q. Can you take upon you to say, this is your master's iron?
Wade. I cannot say it is my master's iron; the woman said she saw him take it out of the shop; this is the bar I took from him.

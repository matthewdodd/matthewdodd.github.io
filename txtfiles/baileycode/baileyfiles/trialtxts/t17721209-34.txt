            ; the prisoner was an acquaintance of mine; I left her in my room last Saturday sevennight; I lodge in Bridges-court, St. Giles's


; she brought the key to me, to a place where I was; I missed the money, and a shirt; the money was tied up in a handkerchief and put in a cupboard; the prisoner saw me count the money and put it in the cupboard. I saw nothing of the prisoner till last Wednesday, when she was taken into custody; she confessed she stole the shirt and 6 s. and 6 d. and gave us a direction to a pawnbroker with whom she had pawned the shirt.
The pawnbroker produced the shirt, which he deposed was left with him, by the prisoner, on the 28th of November, in the evening.

Mrs. Brown gave me leave to pawn the shirt.

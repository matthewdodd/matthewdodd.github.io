            . The Prisoner Macguire was a Watchman
 in Mr Whiteman and Worthington's Brewhouse-yard, and he confessed that he let in Kelly about two o'Clock in the Morning, and that he fetch'd the Crank down out of the Room, and so it was conveyed off. The Thing was first discovered by Kelly's offering of it to sale, to one Cann, a Smith by Hatton-wall, who told Cann that he had it of the Housekeeper of York-Buildings Company; upon this the whole Affair came out.
But as there was no other Evidence of Kelly's being concerned but what Macguire said, and Kelly having a pretty good Character, he was 

               Acquitted
            , but Macguire found 

               Guilty
            .

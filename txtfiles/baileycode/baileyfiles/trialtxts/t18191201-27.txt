             and Machin Lake, we live at No. 103, Cheapside


. On the 20th of November, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was alone in the counting-house, and saw a person carrying some blue printed calico on his shoulder along the passage, by the side of the counting-house, from the warehouse to the street - he turned towards King-street - I followed, and collared him about twenty yards from our door, and asked where he got those goods? he said a person had given them to him. I brought him back with the prints on his shoulder. We found he had four pieces, which were ours - It was the prisoner.

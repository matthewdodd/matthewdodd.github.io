Prisoner's defence. I am very sorry for what I have done; I have to beg Mr. Rose's mercy; I had no intention to defraud Mr. Rose; in every other respect I have done Mr. Rose complete justice; and why I put these things in my pocket, I don't know.
Mr. Rose. Her husband is now in confinement at Colchester for having in his possession three of my shirts; he is a dragoon.
Q. Had he access to your house? - A. No.

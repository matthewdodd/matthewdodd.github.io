            . I am the wife of Daniel Dines. On the 24th of May I had been washing; I saw the prisoner go through the yard, and in about five minutes I missed two shirts, five handkerchiefs, and a cap; I took in the rest of the articles, and gave an alarm; a gentleman rode after the prisoner, and brought him back again - I had seen him at a sale at the next house the day before.
Prisoner. It was a public throughfare - I suppose one hundred people passed through there at the time.

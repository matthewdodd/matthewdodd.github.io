             and I are partners, we live at the house called the Round-about-house, near Wellclose-square




, it joins to the watch-house. I lie in the country for the benefit of the air; coming home on the 30th of May, between 7 and 8 in the morning, I found a hole broke through the brick-wall, so that a person might get in through it, my son and the rest of the family lay in the house; we keep a stocking-wareho use; when we came to examine, we missed 3 or 4 dozen of stockings, a wig of mine, and another of my son's; the stockings were taken out of the parlour. I enquired of the constable, where the watchmen were? he told me they had been drinking and quarelling all night; on the Tuesday following I was told the thieves were in goal, and the wigs found; I went and saw the three prisoners in the Court-house, in Well-close-square; the woman at the bar said she found the wigs at the end of Denmark-street; we took them before the Justice, and swore to the wigs, and they were committed.

            . I am partner with my father-in-law. I heard an uncommon noise just before I went to bed, about 11 o'clock, I went and looked about, expecting to find a shutter down; we went to bed, and in the morning I got up between 5 and 6, I found a hole broke about a foot from the ground, and the stockings that were in the holes were pulled out, my wig, and my father's wig were missing, and some other things that were not in the indictment; what quantity of stockings I cannot tell, our people think there may be four or six dozen missing.

             saw us, she got up and looked at the stockings. I asked her if there was a pair that fitted me? she said they were all women's stockings, and all purple. On the Monday they sold the things, as they told me when I came on shore; at night Whitfield gave me half a guinea, and I gave Jack 6 d. ten shillings was my share. I lay all that night upon three chairs at Charlotte's house, and on Tuesday those gentlemen came and took Madin and Jack-above-ground and

Mrs. Anderson. My husband's name is James. On the 4th of March I called the maid up as usual at 6 in the morning; she went down stairs, and in less than a minute came up again; I found, by her speaking to my daughter, my house was broke open; I got up and went down, and found a desk was taken away from off the counter that we used to keep money and plate in, and a parcel of cloaths from off a table, linnen aprons, new cloaths, handkerchiefs, and different sorts of things in our way of business, we are pawnbrokers; I missed the till also from under the counter, and a closet was stripped of other goods; most of my loss was in money. On the 10th of March I advertized several things, after I had got the marks from the owners; about a month after that we were beset by eight boys and two men about 11 o'clock one night, Swift that was executed last was one of them. After that I heard that

             was taken up, I went to the tower goal, and asked him if he was any way concerned in robbing me? he said, no, but he believed he knew them that did; he mentioned Great Sam, and Jack-above-ground, and others, I did not hear him mention Madin; after the last sessions he came to me and said he believed there was some of my blankets at Jack-above-ground's; I said I was not particular as to them, but there was one thing that was very particular, which was in the desk when taken away, that was a copper tobacco-box with a brass top and bottom with harlequins upon it; he hesitated a little, and said he believed he had seen that box in Bridewell, in

            's hand. He went and brought it (produced in court) the next morning, I went to the turnkey of Bridewell, the keeper came to Justice Scott's, and swore to seeing it in Madin's hand, but he is sick and not here. After Madin was taken I went to him at the Tower goal, I asked him how he came by that box? he said it was given him by a young man that is gone to sea; he said the same before the bench of Justices. Jack-above-ground, after taken, made discovery of my robbery; this prisoner was always stubborn.
Prisoner. Jack-above-ground is the very person that gave me the box.

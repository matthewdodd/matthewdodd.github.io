            . I live at the Crown and Star, Leaden-hall-street; my brother is a linen-draper; the prisoner came into our shop under a pretence of buying some handkerchiefs; I shewed him some, he said they would not do, and desired to see some more; when I went to take some more down, I saw him going to put some under his coat from off the counter; I tur ned about and looked at him, and he dropped them: I would not shew him any more. Then he wanted to see a piece of check for an apron for his mother; as I was going to take down some to shew him, I saw him put his hand amongst the handkerchiefs and took up this piece, containing two handkerchiefs (producing it) and put it under his waistcoat-flap; then he said he saw there was no check that would do for him, and was going out; I laid hold on him before he got out of the shop. I charged him with the handkerchiefs, he denied them. Upon lifting up his waistcoat I found them upon him; I secured him, and sent for my brother; he was taken before my Lord-Mayor, where he owned the fact, and was committed.
Prisoner's defence.
I never had the handkerchiefs, neither did I own I had them.

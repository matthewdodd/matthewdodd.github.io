            . Wootton was our errand boy
. I came to town on the evening of the 18th of September, I found two or three rooms had been opened, and property stolen. Wootton was not in the habit of coming on Sundays.
BETSEY TUCKER. I am servant
 to Mr. Gye. I went to Church at three o'clock in the afternoon, returned at seven o'clock, and missed this property. I found every thing turned out of my box.

            . I am servant to the prosecutors. I let Wootton in about half-past five o'clock in the evening. I was at home all day - nobody but him came. I let him out about seven o'clock.

            . I am porter to Mr. Gye. I was sent to Chatham with a warrant to apprehend Wootton and Hutley. I got information on board a ship, and found Toms and Wootton sitting in a public-house, eating soup with these silver spoons; they laid them upon the table as we entered the room. The officer took six spoons off the table, and we found two upon Toms, also a crown, half-crown, one shilling, and a silk handkerchief claimed by Tucker, and round Wootton's neck I found a silk handkerchief; I asked him what had become of the remaining spoon? he said we took but nine - (I had found one upon a sailor boy, who was with them) - he said
"I took nothing, Hutley took all." He then asked me what time it was found out? I said on Sunday afternoon; he said that was impossible, for it was eight o'clock when the thing was done.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MARKWELL
               



            . I am a patrol. I was informed that Hutley was concerned in the robbery; I went to his father's house in Little Bell-alley, and asked if he was there? his mother said No, he had not slept there since Tuesday - (this was Thursday evening) - I said it was useless saying so, for he was seen going into the house; she then said he was in the house. I went up, and found him upon the bed; I took him to the watch-house, and said it was a pity he went on as he did; he said he would tell me the truth - I neither threatened or promised him. He said on the day previous to the robbery, Wootton told him if he and Toms came to Fleet-street on Sunday, he should be able to supply them with money; that he and Toms accordingly went on Sunday evening, Wootton let them in, and they carried out 23 s. in silver, 13 s. 6 d. in copper, three silk handkerchiefs, and ten spoons. They then went to Gravesend by the boat, and sold one of the spoons to a Jew, for 1 s., after breaking the mark off the top. He said if I had come a day later, he had got a ship and was going away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
WOOTTON'S Defence. Hutley told the officer wrong. He was after me for a fortnight, and Toms did not go into the house.
HUTLEY'S Defence. While I was helping a woman to move goods on Saturday, Wootton came up with a bag of tea, and asked me to go to Piccadilly with him, as he had a plan laid out; I said I would not, as I was moving goods; he said I should get much more by it, and I went with him. He said he had been nearly four hours gone with the tea, and expected to be turned away; and the best way was to get some money, and be off. I went with him on Sunday, as the officer said; he told me to crawl upon my hands and knees; I said he had better let me go out, he called me a coward, and gave me ten spoons to take out. Toms was waiting at a distance.

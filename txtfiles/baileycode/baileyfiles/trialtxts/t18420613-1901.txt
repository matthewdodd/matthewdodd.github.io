THOMAS CHATTERDON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of April, 1 watch, value 5l;. 2 seals, value 10s.; and 1 watch-guard, value 11s.; the goods of 



Benjamin Bellringer.






SARAH BELLRINGER
. I am the wife of Benjamin Bellringer; we live in Crown-court, Russell-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner had a ready. furnished room in our house from the 31st of March till the 8th of April—on that morning he brought two more persons to breakfast with him, and they all left—I had a watch hanging in the kitchen, which had a silver guard, seals, and a key to it—I missed it when they were gone—the prisoner never returned—this is the watch, guard, seals, and key.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I took the apartment? A. No, another took it, but you came as two brothers, in the name of Chatterdon—I was told Mr. Adams called, but I did not see him—he did not give me any money for the rent.

COURT. Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one who was in the house that morning? A. Yes—he went away, and did not come back.





GEORGE ATTENBOROUGH
. I am in the service of Richard Attenborough, a pawnbroker. I produce a silver watch, a guard, and seals, which I took in of the prisoner on the morning of the 8th of April—I am sure he is the person.

Prisoner's Defence, A person named Adams took the apartment; he

asked me if I would take part of a lodging with him, as his cousin was going into the country; and he said, when he left I should go and stop with him; we all had breakfast there that morning, and all came out together; the party who took the apartment would have been here, but I understand he is confined in Tot hill-fields for an assault.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—



Transported for Seven Years. (There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

FRANCIS HUME CHOPPIN. I live at Enfield-highway


. I lost these rabbits on the 8th of April; I had seen them safe in my barn on the Saturday night or Sunday morning; I suspected the prisoner, who had lived with me, and sent an officer to his house.(Property produced and sworn to.)
JOHN WILSON. I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant; he was not at home -I saw his wife, and found the rabbits in his wash-house on the Monday morning; he lives about half a mile from the prosecutor - the prosecutor identified the rabbits; his barn was locked, but they might have entered by a board which lifts up.
Prisoner. I bred these young ones myself.

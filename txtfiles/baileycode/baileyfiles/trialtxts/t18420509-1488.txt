1488. 




FREDERICK RALPH
 and 




JAMES JONES
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
13th of April, 1 cloak, value 3l., the goods of 



William Grange Pater.






JOHN M'PHERSON
. I am errand-boy to Mr. Reed, a linen-draper. On the 13th of April I was standing at my master's door, and saw Ralph take the cloak out of Mr. Pater's phaeton—I called "Stop thief"—he passed it to Jones—they both ran away down Vinegar-lane—I ran after them, and lost sight of Jones—he had the cloak—I am sure Ralph is the person I saw take it.





SAMUEL SOUTER
. I was walking in Back-lane, Lower Shadwell—I saw Jones with the cloak under his arm, and Ralph close behind him—they were walking up Back-lane—I saw Ralph give Jones a white handkerchief, in which Jones wrapped the cloak—I passed them, and walked as far as Devonport-street—I saw a number of persons running—I asked a groom there if he had lost any thing—he said, "Yes, a cloak"—we went to the first turning in Devonport-street, and saw Ralph in Vinegar-fields—we ran after him—he was taken—this is the cloak I saw Jones with.





JAMES WHITING
. I am groom to Mr. William Grange Pater. This is his cloak—I lost it on Wednesday, the 13th of April, from his phaeton, between twelve and one o'clock—it was missed for about half an hour.

Ralph's Defence. I was going down the Commercial-road to look after work, and heard the cry of "Stop thief." I ran, they ran after me, and stopped me. I know nothing about the cloak. I do not know Jones; I do not think I ever saw him before.

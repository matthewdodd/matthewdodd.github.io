JOHN LE RICHEUX. I am a warehouseman
 in Lad-lane. On the 4th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I hired a coach from the stand, at the top of Goswell-road, Islington; I had a bag with me, which contained two coats - I discharged the coach at the Cock, at Holloway


; I forgot to take the bag out - I have seen the coats and bag since; I believe the prisoner was the driver of the coach
, but am not quite positive.

            . I am the watchman at Goswell-road stand. I remember the coach being hired between twelve and one o'clock on the 4th of January - the prisoner drove it; he is not the regular driver, but the coachman was at supper, and he called the prisoner to drive it and bring it back - he brought back the coach, but did not say any thing about the bag or coats.

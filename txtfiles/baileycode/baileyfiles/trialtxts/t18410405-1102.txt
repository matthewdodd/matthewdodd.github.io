JAMES AYRES

At a quarter before seven o'clock on the 9th of March, I saw the prisoner on my master's area steps—he asked if a groom lived there named Joseph Nichol—I said, "No"—I missed this pair of my mister's boots in two or three minutes—I went and overtook the prisoner near the corner of Belgrave-square—he had just thrown away one boot, and was running away with the other—I took hold of him as he ran away from a door, and took him back to our own house—he had got one boot in his pocket—he took it out and gave it to the policeman—these are the boots.

Prisoner. Q. What door was it at? A. No. 10, Belgrave-square—I bad placed the boots down stairs about five minutes before—I do not think there was time for them to be taken and sold—they were taken from the dwelling-house.

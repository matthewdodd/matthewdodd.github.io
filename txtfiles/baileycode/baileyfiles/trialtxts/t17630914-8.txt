The prosecutor is a silk-dyer
, and lives in Coleman-street; a lady brought several pieces of silk to be dyed, at the delivering it again to her a piece of green damask was missing; the lady, in attempting to buy a piece to match it, found the piece missing at Mrs. Gray's, a milliner and baberdasher, on the back of St. Clements; the prosecutor, upon that, charged the prisoner, who was his shop-woman
, with stealing, and getting it there; she confessed the fact, and was sworn to by Mrs. Green. The other things were found sold by her at the same place, which she acknowledged she had stolen from her master.

 was indicted

for stealing 1 saw, value 4s.; and 1 chopper, 2s. 6d.; the goods of

MATTHEW HUTCHINSON
. I am a labourer, and live in New-row, Deptford. On Monday, the 9th of June, I left my saw and chopper in my own cellar—I lost them—the cellar was not locked nor bolted—the flap opens to the street—this is my saw and chopper—here is my name on the saw.





THOMAS WILLIAM COPE
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker at Rotherhithe. On Tuesday morning, the 10th of June, the prisoner came with this saw and chopper—he wanted half a crown for them—I asked if they were his own—he said, yes, he lived at Deptford; he had got a job at Kotherhithe, and wished to leave his tools till the next day—he gave the name of John Hutchinson—I lent him the money—I am sure he is the man.


Prisoner. I told him they were Matthew Hutchinson's.




GUILTY
.*— Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

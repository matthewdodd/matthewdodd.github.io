            . I am watchman of Marylebone. On the 6th of April, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner with the fowls; he said he brought them from Hampstead, for Mr. Martin, who was a bricklayer, and lived in Cato-street; I took him to the watch-house. He had ten hens, all dead, in his bag. Mrs. Fowler claimed them.

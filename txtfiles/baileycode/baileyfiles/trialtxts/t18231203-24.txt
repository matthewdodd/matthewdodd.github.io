            . I live in Charlotte-street, Berkeley-square, and am servant
 to Lord A'Boyle. On the 14th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Smithfield-bars


, going towards St. John-street. I thought I felt something at my pocket; put my hand down and missed my handkerchief; turned round, and saw the prisoner about two yards from me running away. I suspected him, and ran after him, and saw him throw it away. I picked it up, and caught hold of him without losing sight of him.

            . I am a constable, and was on duty in Smithfield on Friday, the 14th of November, and met the prisoner running, and the prosecutor close at his heels. I laid hold of him at the same moment as him. He said it was not him who took it, and begged forgiveness, and he never would do it again.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work, and went to Smithfield to get a job. I was running up to a man who told me to ride his horse, when this gentleman laid hold of me.



               GUILTY

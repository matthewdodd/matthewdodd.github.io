BENJAMIN SOARES WILLIS. I am in the house of Smith, Payne, and Smith. I was on Ludgate-hill


, and lost my handkerchief from my coat pocket; I did not feel it, but was told of it - I had had it five minutes before; I turned round, and a friend pointed out the prisoner, who was about three yards from me, and had his hand in his right-side pocket - I ran up to him, pulled out his hand, and my handkerchief was in it.
GEORGE HUSSEY. I was walking with Mr. Willis; I saw the prisoner close behind him - I watched, and saw him draw his hand from Mr. Willis' pocket and put it into his own - I asked Willis if he had lost a handkerchief - he said he had, and took it from the prisoner's hand.

            . I am an officer. I was standing by and took the prisoner; I found two other handkerchiefs on him, all of different patterns.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that his handkerchief was thrown at him, and as nobody owned it he put it into his pocket.

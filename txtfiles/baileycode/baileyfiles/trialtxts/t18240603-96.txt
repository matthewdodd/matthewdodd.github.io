                  JOHN 
                  STORY
               



            . I have a house in Whitechapel


. On Monday morning last I was informed that it had been broken into, and robbed of the leaden gutters. I had passed there on the Friday previous, but the lead was not visible; but on looking up it appeared that one of the windows had been pressed in, and I sent my son down to see to it. I went down on the Monday, and found the roof much disconcerted, the gutters taken away, and the flashing of the windows - upwards of three cwt. of lead was gone - I saw it afterwards at the watch-house, and the size of it corresponded with the spaces on the house - it had been cut, and torn off - the edges appeared bright, as if fresh cut, but in a haggling manner - the prisoners were in custody.


                  JOHN 
                  THOMAS STORY
               



            . I am the son of the last witness. I went to the house on Friday - the lead was apparently all right then. On Monday I went with my father, and it was stripped off.


                  MICHAEL 
                  HUGHES
               



            . I am a watchman of the parish of Christ Church - this house is on my beat. About twenty minutes before three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the house; and knowing that it was uninhabited, I fetched my partner Lewing, and another watchman. I knocked at the door of the next house; we went in, and got over the pales. I heard some persons whispering in the house. I came round again, and the prisoner Lackey jumped out of the window; I laid hold of him in the yard - my partner sprung his rattle - the Whitechapel watchman laid hold of one of the other prisoners, and Powell and Brown secured the other two. They were taken to the watch-house, and I returned to the house. The roof was much damaged, and a quantity of lead laid in the garret; it had been cut, except one piece, which had been drawn from a gutter, and was hanging down; here is the piece that was hanging down; it is gutter lead; I then found a smock frock, which the prisoner Wilson said was his, but Cook put it on. After I left duty I went again to the house, and found a knife, which Hurling claimed; the lead was afterwards claimed by Mr. Story; it weighed 320 lbs.


                  JOHN 
                  LEWING
               



            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 31st of May, in consequence of information from Hughes, I went to the house; we heard some whispering inside, and saw Lackey drop from a window nearly as high as a first story; he was secured. I sprung my rattle. We were then in the back premises. We took him to the watch-house, and found the other three there. I went back to the house, and found a piece of lead in the wash-house, but I did not look further. It appeared to have been taken from the house, partly cut and partly torn away - the edges were bright, as if cut by a knife.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WARNE
               



            . I am a watchman. I was stationed by Hughes at the front door; I saw the door open, and the prisoners put their hands out; I pushed it open, and seized Hurling there; there were others inside, but they made their way up stairs. I sprung my rattle, Brown and Powel came, and went up stairs; they came down shortly; each brought a prisoner - they were all taken to the watch-house - a knife was found on one of them, with the edges turned, as if with cutting something hard. We went back to the house, and found a quantity of lead doubled up in one of the garrets, and the smock frock was laying by it.


                  THOMAS 
                  BROWN
               



            . I am a watchman. I heard the rattle sprung - went to the house, and saw a watchman standing at the door with a prisoner in his hand; I went up stairs, and found Cook secreted in a corner of the garret; I took him, and called to Powell to look up the chimney, and he pulled Wilson down. I took Cook, and two small pieces of lead to the watch-house - I went on the roof, and found a chissel in the gutter - the lead weighed 320 lbs. - it was claimed by Mr. Story.
JURY. Q. When you took Cook, was the lead upon him - A. No; lying by his side.


                  JOHN 
                  POWELL
               



            . I am a watchman. I went up stairs into the garret and saw Brown with Cook; he told me to look up the chimney; I found Wilson there, and took him into custody; they were all taken to the watch-house - we found several pieces of lead in the house - I went back to the house and found the gutters stripped of the lead.

                  HART
               



            . I was the night constable. The four prisoners were brought to the watch-house - here is a knife which was found on Cook, it appeared bright, as if it hadbeen recently used. I saw the frock produced, but neither of them claimed it in my hearing; the lead was afterwards claimed by Mr. Story.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
COOK'S Defence. I was out of employ, and hope Mr. Story will forgive me.

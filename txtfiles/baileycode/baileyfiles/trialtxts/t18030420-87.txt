            . - I am a druggist
: On the 25th of February, between the hour of twelve and one, passing through Thames-street


, I felt my pocket lighter on a sudden, as if something had been taken out; I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and found my pocket-handkerchief had been taken; I turned round, and saw two stout boys, one of them was the prisoner; I seized this boy by the collar, and said, you rascal, you have picked my pocket; and under the slap of his coat I discovered the pocket-handkerchief which I had just lost; he immediately dropped it; I saw him drop it; I then took him to a constable, and we took him to the Mansion-house, and he was committed; the constable has had the handkerchief ever since.

Prosecutor. I have no doubt but it is my handkerchief; I have many of the same piece.
Prisoner's defence. As I was going down Thames-street, between twelve and one o'clock, I was walking behind this man, and there was another boy betwixt him and me, and whether the boy picked it out of this man's pocket I don't know;this boy ran away, and the gentleman said to me, you have took my handkerchief, and I will punish you, as the law directs.

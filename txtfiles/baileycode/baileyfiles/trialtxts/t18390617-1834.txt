1834. 




WILLIAM RYALL
 and 




GEORGE BANKS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
17th of May, 1 set of cupping instruments and case, value 3l., and five weights, value 2s.; the goods of 



Philip Peter Smyth.






MARY ANN SMTTH
. I live with my father, a surgeon at Bromley. On the 17th of May I received information, and went out—I saw Ryall about forty yards from our house with this box of instruments under his arm—I had seen it safe on our counter a little before, and I had seen the prisoners in the shop—they were strangers to me.





THOMAS BEAL
. On the 17th of May I stood on the bridge, over the River Lea. I saw the two prisoners running towards the bridge—Banks was some distance before Ryall—several boys were following them, crying "Stop thief!"—I did not stop Banks, as I thought they were at play—by that time Ryall was near the bridge, and had the box under his arm—before I could get to him he threw it, intending to throw it in the river, but it struck against the bridge, and bounded hack, aid flew open—some of the contents went into the river, and some in the road—there were two or three glasses, which broke—I picked up some of them, and some other person took up the box—I kept Ryall till the clock struck one—Smyth came up, and said the box was her father's—I then gave Ryall to a man to take care of him.





THOMAS PEARSON
 (police-constable K 220.) I took Ryall, and received the box—this scarificator I got since, from a man who got it out of the river.





PHILIP PETER SMYTH
. This is my box, and these are my instruments.

Ryall's Defence. Two boys ran on first, and dropped it—I took it up.

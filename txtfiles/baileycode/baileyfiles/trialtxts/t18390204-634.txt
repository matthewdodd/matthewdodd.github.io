GEORGE CASEY
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of December, 1 leaden pump, value 18s., the goods of 



Thomas Newland Allen, and fixed on certain land of his.






RICHARD RHODES
. I know Rose Villa, in Hampton parish—a leaden pump was taken from there either late on the night of the 8th, or early on the morning of the 9th of December—it was fixed in the ground, and was safe at a quarter past four o'clock on the 8th, because I passed it, and perfectly recollect touching the handle—I missed it the next morning—it was the property of Mr. Thomas Newland Allen.





CORNELIUS STONE
. I am servant to Mr. Reed, of Hampton Wick, he deals in marine stores, and buys lead—I know the prisoner—I saw him

bring the leaden pump to the door—he knocked, and I went to the door—it was seven or a quarter past seven o'clock—it was dark—he brought the pump in a sack—he said he had got a bit more—I saw it taken out of the sack, and saw it was a pump—I called Mrs. Reed—she said, "Have nothing to do with it"—he wanted to leave it on the premises, but she said no, she might just as well buy it—he took it away.





JOHN GROOM
. I was coming from Kingston one night, and saw Snell's cart—the prisoner took a sack out of the cart with a pump in it, and took it to Reed's—he came out again and said, "Snell, it is no go"—I asked the prisoner what he came down for, and he said he had brought that pomp down from Rose Villa that he had asked me to go and get—I asked him who took it—he said he and Tom Knight.

Prisoner. Groom is saying all this against me that he may get off himself—he asked me to go and do several depredations, which I would not.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

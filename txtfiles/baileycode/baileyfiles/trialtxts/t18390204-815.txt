CATHERINE BANKS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of February, I shawl, value 5s., the goods of Michael Hawdon, from the person of 



Ruth Hawdon.







RUTH HAWDON
. I am the wife of Michael Hawdon—we live in Salisbury-street near Portman-market. On the 1st of February, at half-past ten, or near eleven o'clock at night, I was passing from Broad-street to Russell-street, St. Giles's—the prisoner came and asked me if I had any money—I told her I had not—she watched her opportunity, snatched my shawl off me, and ran away—I watched her as far as I could, and called "Police"—the officers took her about ten minutes afterwards—I know her to be the same person—this is my shawl—(looking at it.) CHRISTIAN BURNETT. I saw the prosecutrix walking along, and saw the prisoner take the shawl from her shoulders, and run away with it in her hand—she came towards my door, and then ran into a court, where the policeman took her—I am sure the prisoner is the person.





JAMES BEDMAN
 (police-constable E 56.) I found the prisoner in Buckridge-street, coming out of a cellar—I did not find the shawl.





GEORGE HOBBY
 (police-constable E 129.) I found this shawl the next morning, at No. 13, Buckridge-street.

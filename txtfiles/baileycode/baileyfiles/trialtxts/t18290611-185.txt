            . I am a farmer
, and live at Edgware. The prisoner drove my team on the 22d of June - he had been with me only a fortnight; I sent him up with thirty-six trusses of hay; when it got to town it was not according to the sample, and it would not do; he had no right to sell it; a boy found my horses at Stanmore, two miles further, and brought them home.

            . I am an officer. On Friday last I received information that the prisoner was at work, and I went and found him at Harrow; I said, "I want you;" he said, "For what?" I said, "I dare say you know about Mr. Bunce's hay;" he said, "I thought so;" he said he had lost the money, and was afraid to go to his master; that he had gone to work at haymaking for some time, and then went to the workhouse.
Prisoner's Defence. I lost the money, and was afraid to go home; his son told me to sell it if I could.

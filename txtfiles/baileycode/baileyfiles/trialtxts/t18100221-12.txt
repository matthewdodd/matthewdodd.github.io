            . Mr. Keene's man bought six carcases of mutton at Newgate-market


; I took two of them down to the cart, and ran back for two more; when I returned with them, there was one missing, a man coming by, told me, he saw a man run up Giltspur-street, with a sheep on his shoulder. I immediately ran after him, and got sight of him in Giltspur-street; I followed him through the Blue-coat School, and catched him in Little Britain with the carcase of mutton on his shoulder. I said, my friend, that is my mutton; he looked at me, and chucked it from his shoulder in the dirt, I brought him back to the market. I left the sheep at Mr. Starkey's, in Little Britain. I gave him in charge of the constable.

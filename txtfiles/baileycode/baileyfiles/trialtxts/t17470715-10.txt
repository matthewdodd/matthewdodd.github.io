             . On Saturday the 20th of the last Month, between nine and ten at o'Clock at Night, as I was coming along Cheapside there was a Crowd by Honey-lane Market


, and I stopp'd there with the next Witness, Mr Pugh , in Company with me, there I saw the Prisoner at the Bar put his Hand into a Person's Pocket, unknown to me, upon which I immediately caught hold of him, but I lost the Gentleman in the Crowd , and delivered the Prisoner to the Watchmen. There were several of the Prisoner's Accomplices there, and made a great Disturbance .
Prisoner. Please to ask him, if he found any Thing upon me.
Jones . I found the Handkerchief on the Ground, that I saw him take out of the Gentleman's Pocket.


                  James 
                  Pugh 
               



             . I was present at the same Time, and saw the Prisoner take the Handkerchief, and immediately Mr Jones seiz'd him. I took hold of the Gentleman that had lost the Handkerchief, and ask'd him, if he had not lost an Handkerchief? And he said, he had. And the Gentleman that laid hold of the Prisoner was thrown down by the Prisoner's Accomplices, while we were carrying the Prisoner along to the Watch-house.
Q. What said the Prisoner, when he was apprehended?
Pugh. He was very bullying, and said, he would take us up for an Assault. There were two or three Men attempting to rescue him from us.
The Prisoner had nothing to say in his Defence.



               Guilty
            .

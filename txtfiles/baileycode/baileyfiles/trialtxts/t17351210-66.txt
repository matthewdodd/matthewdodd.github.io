            . This Wilchin of Fish was cut away from our Stowage. November 14. where I have fifty or sixty pounds worth of Lamperns.
- Creech. As I was going to my Craft at Hammersmith, I met the Prisoner and another who is not taken, and they thought proper to take this Wilchin of Lamperns, and I was in my Skiff at the same time.
Prisoner. Did I take them, or he that run away?
Creech. You row'd in the Boat, while he flung the grapplings over board, and haul'd the Wilchin to him. Then we row'd to Justice Barker's Rails. We went a shore and they were drest at night and I eat one Meal of them.
Q. Then you were concern'd?
Creech. Concern'd? yes, or else what did I go there for? I could not be concern'd if I was not there, tho' I never laid finger upon them, till they were brought on Shore.

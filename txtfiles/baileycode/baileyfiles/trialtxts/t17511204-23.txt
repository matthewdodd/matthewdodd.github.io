            . The watch was hanging in the vessel, called the Sarah and Elizabeth, lying at Wapping-Stairs


. The prisoner and that were gone together. On Saturday night Nov. the 3d, I took him up, and had him before sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , he confessed before and after at the justice's house he stole it, and that it was pawn'd for half a Guinea, I went by his directions and found it.

            . The prisoner came to me about the beginning of Nov. and said he had been with his captain for some wages, but could get none, so was obliged to pawn his watch, and he would redeem it as soon as he took his money. I lent him 5 s. the next day he came and said he had been again, and could not get any money; so at his desire I lent him 5 s. more; a day or two after the prosecutor came with an officer and demanded the watch I delivered it. I went to sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , there the prisoner owned he stole it, and was drunk.
Prisoner's Defence.
He gave me the key of his chest to go and get a dram. I was very much in liquor. I took the watch out, and went and pawn'd it.

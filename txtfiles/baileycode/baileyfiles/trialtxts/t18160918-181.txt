                  , from his person

WILLIAM SMALLWOOD. I was coming along Broad-street, St. Giles's


, about twelve o'clock at night, and was stopped by the prisoner; she caught hold of me, and I extricated myself from her. The moument she went from me, I missed my money. I pursned her to the corner of George-street, where she made a stop; I don't think that she suspected I was following her; but she turned her head, and saw me close behind her; and speaking rather sharp, said, are you going home; I told her I was, but that she was not. I immediatley called a watchman, and the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse; they there asked me what I had lost, and I told them, a half crown, and six or seven shillings besides. She was searched, and that money was found rolled up in the corner of her shawl, which she held in her hand.

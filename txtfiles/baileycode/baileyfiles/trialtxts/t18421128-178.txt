DENNIS WHEELAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of Nov., 1 umbrella, value 4s, the goods of 



William Vinter; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM VINTER
. I am a dairyman, and live in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 13th of Nov., I was at the back of my shop, and heard a noise—I went, and saw the till open as far as it could go—I had not left it open—I saw the prisoner stooping down by the side of the counter, with this umbrella in his hand—I said, "You young thief, you have got my umbrella"—he looked me in the face, and ran out with it—I followed, calling "Stop thief," and he dropped it three doors from my house—I took it up—he was stopped by two gentlemen, and brought back—he said, "I hope you will forgive me, I will never do so again; a great big man outside the door told me to do it"—I cannot say whether there was any man outside belonging to him—I heard a scuffle with some persons—this is my umbrella.





GEORGE TOCOCK
 (police-constable E43.) I took the prisoner—he said he took the umbrella, and ran away with it.


Prisoner's Defence. I did not say so; I was going along, and fell down; two men caught me, and said I was a thief. I know Mr. Rawlinson's writing—this is his signature to this examination—(read)—"The prisoner says,' I won't do it any more."





JOHN CROFTS
 (police-constable D179.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

Sixth Jury, before Edward Bullock, Esq.

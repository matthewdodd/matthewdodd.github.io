            . On the 19th of November, my House was broke open, and the Goods stole, but I can't say what particular Time it was; I found his Coat in William Brown's Cellar, and his Wife own'd to me that she had pawn'd two pair of Stockings, and that they were brought to her by the Evidence, Meighan.

                  Cotterel 
               



            , with the Prisoner and my Brother, we unbolted the half Door and went into the Shop, and fetched out a great Coat, which I gave my Brother: Then I went in again and fetch'd out the Stockings, those I gave to William Macdurment; then we all went to one Grant's in Bowlyard, and parted them. We had 5 pair a-piece; I carried mine to the Prisoner ( Brown's Wife) and one pair she bought for her Husband, and gave me 18 d. for them, the rest she pawn'd for 2 s. a pair. The Coat we sold

Macdurment. I know nothing of this Evidence.
Brown. Please to clear my Wife: I ask'd him when I bought the Coat if 'twas honestly come by, and as to the Stockings, I order'd my Wife to pawn them. Macdurmont

            . I live in Paradise-street, Shoreditch


, and am a chandler
. On the 9th of February I was opposite my shop, about half-past seven o'clock - I saw the prisoner and another person standing near my shop; the prisoner then went in, and took up this cheese from my counter - I went, and stopped him; I sent for the officer, and gave him into custody - here is one Cheshire cheese, and three pieces; a man named Nelson was with him, and he followed me in, but did not take any thing - my wife was in doors; I had been out about an hour and a half, and was just coming home.

            . I live in Whitfield-street, and am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I saw the prisoner and another man at his shop; I saw the prisoner go into the shop - the prosecutor followed him; the other man went in after him, but did not take any thing - I thought they were going to rob the shop; if we had gone in sooner, most likely they would have gone away.

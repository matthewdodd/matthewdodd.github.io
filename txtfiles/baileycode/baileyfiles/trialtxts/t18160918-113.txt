JOHN RICHARDSON. About eleven o'clock at night I went into the Mackworth's Arms in the Commercial Road


; I had the watch in my hands, and called for a pint of porter. The prisoner and another young man were sitting opposite to me; I had the watch in my hand. The young man who was with the prisoner said young man, that looks a good thing, let me look at it; upon which I put the watch into his hand; he immediately got up, and went towards the bar. A young man who was a stranger said to me immediately, young man you are done; surely said I, the man will never act that way, and I sat about half an hour. I got up, and left the prisoner 
               
                  George 
                  Taylor
               



             sitting where he was. The man returned me the watch, and I went out. I had not been just got out, when the prisoner Taylor followed me; and a little distance from the Mackworth's Arms, he snatched the watch from me; I pursued him closely, calling stop thief, and the watchman Mr. Morgan, took him into custody.

            . I took the prisoner, and there was an attempt to rescue him.

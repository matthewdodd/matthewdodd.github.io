 was indicted

Henry Elder Norie; from his person.






HENRY ELDER NORIE
. I lodge in Turner's-court, St. Martin's-lane. I met the prisoner in George-street, St. Giles's, at two o'clock last Sunday morning, and went with her to a room—two or three minutes after we were there she put her hand into my pocket—I told her to take it out—she did so, and in about two minutes after she put it in again, and took out one half-crown, three shillings, and one sixpence—I did not discover it till she had been out of the room a minute—she said she would go and get some water—she did not return—I went down, met her, asked her for my money, and took hold of her—a man said he would knock my head about if I did not let her go—I called the policeman—he came and took her—one six-pence was found on her, which I can swear had been in my pocket.





JAMES M'CORMACK
 (police-constable E 59.) I took the prisoner in charge.





MARY CONNELL
. I searched the prisoner, and found a half-crown, one shilling, a sixpence, and two pence—as soon as I delivered up the money, the prosecutor said that was the sixpence he had.

Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man at all—he was not with me.

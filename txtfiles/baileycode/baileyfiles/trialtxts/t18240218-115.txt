            . I am an officer. I stopped the prisoner between five and six o'clock, in Bedford-street, Strand, with this cloth in his apron. He said they were cuttings, which he had saved up, and afterwards, that he had bought them of somebody, but he could not tell who. I went to different shops, and the prosecutrix claimed them, and described one particular piece.
Cross-examined. Q. In what state were they - A. Tied up with list round them - he had them in a leather apron. He said he gave 5 s. for them. I know that he worked a little as a tailor.

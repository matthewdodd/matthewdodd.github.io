            . I live in Harrow-alley, Houndsditch


, and keep a public-house
. I had tied the articles stated in the indictment, in a bundle, and put them on a table in the bar. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the tap-room, and had half a pint of beer, she then went into the kitchen-customers sometimes go there; I missed her, and thought she was gone. In about twenty minutes she pushed by me, and went out with the bundle under her arm - She was immediately brought back with them. She did not drink her beer.

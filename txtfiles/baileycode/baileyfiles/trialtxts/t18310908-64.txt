            . I live at the foot of Londonbridge, on the City side, and am a watchmaker
. On the 22nd of August, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop, and from certain circumstances, which I must not mention, I had my suspicion, and went into the shop - I told my wife to show her what she wanted to see; I went to where I could command a view of the shop without being seen; my female-servant followed me to the same place - the servant directed my attention to her; I did not see her take the watch, but I saw her put it into her bosom - I came round into the shop, put my hand into her bosom, and took it from nearly under her arm; it was a watch which I had to repair.
BETSEY COOPER. I am in Mr. Hatton's service. I saw the prisoner reach over, take the watch from the board, and put it into her bosom - I went round, and shut the shop door; Mr. Hatton took it from her bosom.

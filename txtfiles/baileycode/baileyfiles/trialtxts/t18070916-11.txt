            . I am a porter to Mr. Kinder. On Monday morning, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, I was opening the shop, I had the door open, I was taking the iron bar of the shutters down; I went into the shop and missed the piece of linen from a pile of goods that stood right opposite the door; he went from the door very quick, I followed him and stopped him a few yards from the door; I took the piece of linen from under his arm, it was covered with his coat; I brought him back and the linen into the shop, and sent for an officer.
Q. Did you know the man before. - A. No; a morning or two before he had his foot on the step of the door, I reprimanded him and desired him not to be there no more.
(The property produced and identified.)

I am wife of Richard Williams; I let a ready furnished lodging to the woman prisoner; a room on the first floor; Moore was not with her; he came the same night. he paid three shillings a week; they were there rather better than three weeks; I took them to be man and wife; but I since find they are not; the room joining their room, was stripped: I made a great outcry, and sent for an officer: I missed a bed-gown, a sheet, and a blanket: the duplicates were found in the woman's pocket; I saw them taken out by the officer.

I went with the constable to find out the prisoners: the woman was at home; she said to Mrs. Williams, you need not turn down the bed, there is a blanket and a sheet missing; she said they were pawned; and I saw eleven duplicates taken out of her pocket.
PRISONER RYMES's DEFENCE.
I proposed to get the things out; I did not mean to let the things lay in.
PRISONER MOORE's DEFENCE.
I went out about eleven in the forenoon, with intent to get some work; I had been out of work for a long time; I went and got a job; and with the money, I had intentionto get out the sheet and blanket, and pay the rent, which was not due for fifteen hours.
How came she to pass as your wife? - She is not so by law, Sir, but we cohabit together.

THOMAS CALLIS. I am a rope-maker
, and live in Brewer-street, Westminster. On the 9th of April, about eleven o'clock in the day, I had a horse and a chaise, in which was five dozens of halters; I stopped in Cross-lane, Long-acre


, and went into a public-house for refreshment. The prisoner came, and offered to hold my horse; I sent him out a pint of beer; he was a stranger to me. When I came out the horse, chaise, and all were gone. I went to Bow-street, and gave information; the next morning I hired a horse, and went all over London; I got some information - I went to a man, who said he knew where the horse and chaise were. The prisoner was taken, and that man also. I found the horse and chaise near the Diorama, in the New-road, at a livery-stable. The prisoner was taken before I came home. Part of my goods were found under the prisoner's bed. I believe the halters produced are mine.
Prisoner. Q. Was it on the 9th or 10th of April - because you know the 9th was on a Saturday, and this was on a Monday? A. It was the 9th, and you were taken on the 11th.

            . Having received information I apprehended the prisoner, in George-street, and found four dozens and a half of halters under his bed; I told him that he had run away with a horse and cart. After he was taken he gave a clear description where the horse and chaise were.

            . I am a patrole. I saw the prisoner and two other lads lurking about several shops, and attempting them in Clerkenwell, on the evening of the 3rd of this month; at length they came to the prosecutor's shop, and after lurking about it for a long time, the other two boys went in; they all three separated, and went away. I observed the prisoner had something, and I stopped him. and I found this piece of beef in his apron.
(Beef produced, and sworn to.)

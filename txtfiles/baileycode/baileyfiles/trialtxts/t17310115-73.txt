The Prosecutor depos'd, That as he was going along Drury-Lane, the Prisoner ask'd him to make her drink; that they went to a House and drank a Bottle of Ale, and a Quartern of Gin, and the Prisoner led him up Stairs, and she lay down with him on the Bed , and the Candle was put out, and she laid her Hand upon his Thigh, and he being free with her, gave her an Opportunity, and she pick'd his Pocket, and got up, and ran down Stairs; and he asking her, what she went for, she reply'd, she was going to make Water; that he ran down after her, but she got off, but what was stolen from him, was afterwards produced by one Hawkins, a Serjeant in the Guards, who received it, as he said, of the Prisoner's Husband, to whom she had carried it. He being ask'd, if there was no Body in the Room but himself and the Prisoner? reply'd, Yes; his Friend and another Woman, but they were sitting in a Chair, and did never come nigh him.

             for 


               receiving the same, knowing it to be stole, against the Form of the Statute
            .
Mr Willoughby. There was, according to the Plumber's Bill, 8 Hund. 3 qu. 20 lb. Weight of Lead stole from a House belonging to the Duke of Bedford, in Great-Russel-Street



; 700 Weight was lost about Christmas; I believe the rest was taken away the 20th of May.


                  William 
                  Bishop 
               



            . The Prisoner and I took some Lead off the House in January; the last Quantity was about 200 Weight, in May, off the same House Mr Willoughty means: We took it between 11 and 12 at Night, and sold it to one Jeddery, just by St. Giles's Church; Luellin bought the first Parcel about Christmas; we carried it to his House between 4 and 5 in the Morning, and Storer threw it down his Cellar-Window, and after it was Light, we went and saw it weighed, and sold it him for 3 Farthings per Pound.
Luellin. You came to my House, and said you had some Lead to dispose of, and I told you I would not buy it, because I believed you had stole it.

                  Cutler 
               



            . I was with Bishop before the Justice when he was made an Evidence; and Luellin said, I bought none at 3 Farthings per Pound, I gave a Penny for it.
Storer. I never sold the Man any in my Life. Both 

               Guilty
            .

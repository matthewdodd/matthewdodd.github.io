                     Woodworth 
                  



                
            , and 
               
                  
                     Sarah 
                     Birchenough 
                  



                
            , of St. Giles's in the Fields



, were indicted, the former for 


               feloniously stealing three Silver Spoons, and other Goods, in the Dwelling-House
             of 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     March 
                  



                
            , the 9th of this Instant February

, and the latter for 


               receiving the said Goods, knowing them to have been stolen
            .
It appear'd by the Evidence, That Mary Woodworth was Servant
 to the Prosecutor, and having taken the Goods, gave them to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Birchenough 
               



             , who was a Chair-Woman
 that us'd to work at the House, to pawn, and to keep in her Lodgings for her use; accordingly the Goods were found, part at the Pawnbrokers, pawn'd by Birchenough, and the rest in a Box at her Lodgings, Woodworth had nothing to plead in her own Defence, whereupon the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 39 s.
             Birchenough owned her having the Goods from Woodworth, but deny'd that she knew them to be stolen by her ; but it appearing by the Evidence, that she did know it, the Jury found her 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

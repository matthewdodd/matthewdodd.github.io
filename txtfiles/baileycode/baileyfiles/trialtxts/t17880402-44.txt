I am a broker
; on the 19th of March I heard a great noise at the door, I went and found the prisoner in custody with the paintings, I sent for an officer and gave charge of him.

             sworn.
On the 19th of March I saw the prisoner and two other persons walking past the prosecutor's door several times, I saw one of them take the paintings off the window, and give them into the prisoner's apron; they ran off, I ran after them, and laid hold of the prisoner, and he dropped the things.
(The paintings produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A young man asked me to hold the pictures while he buckled his shoe, I took them into my apron and ran away, I called after him, and as I was going after him this man laid hold of me; I am as innocent as a child unborn.
The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him an extraordinary good character.

               Transported for seven years
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

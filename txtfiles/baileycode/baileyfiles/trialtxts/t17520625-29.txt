            . I am a waterman. On the 11th of June I had got forty shillings in halfpence in my boat, tied up in eight crown parcels, which I had received in London for 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Dalton 
               



            , whom I do business for. I went on shore and left the prisoner in the boat, he was my apprentice
. I returned in about a quarter of an hour, he and the money were missing. I had him advertised, and he was taken the next morning with part of the halfpence upon him; he had made away with twenty seven shillings and a penny of it. I took him before Justice Fielding and he confessed it.

            . I took the prisoner in a cellar near Temple bar, he had thirteen shillings all but one penny in halfpence about him, tied up in a handkerchief, done up in two parcels, one had five shillings worth in it. He owned in the watch house that it was the money he took out of his master's boat.

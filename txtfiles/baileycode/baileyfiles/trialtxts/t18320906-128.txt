             (Police-constable N 77). I was on duty at Ball's-pond, Islington


, about five minutes past two o'clock in the morning, on the 23rd of July; I heard some fowls making a noise - I listened, and heard some footsteps in the prosecutor's yard; I jumped on the palings, and saw the prisoner; he said he came for a lodging - he jumped over the pales, and I caught him in my arms and sprung my rattle - he tried to throw me, but some of my brother officers came to my assistance; I sent them to see if there was any one else, but there was not - I then went over myself, and found the fowl-house door open; we took the prisoner to the station, and when I came back I found this fowl under some straw, about a yard from where I saw the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been working for Mr. Frazer, till it was late, and having drank more than I ought, I was hardly capable of walking home; I saw this straw,and laid myself down - another officer brought this bag, which I had never seen before.

            . I am constable of Henley. On the 15th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, Mr. Garret informed me that the prisoner was in the next house, I broke the door open, as it was bolted inside, and found the prisoner there; he said it was his home. I secured him, and asked him what he had done with the breeches and waistcoat? He said they were pledged at Ratcliff-highway, and wrote the direction down.

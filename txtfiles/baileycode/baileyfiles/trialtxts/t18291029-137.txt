I saw the prisoners in company, opposite the Mansion-house, looking in at several shops - they went into Dossetor's shop; I saw Clark trying a pair of braces on Ryan's shoulder - I then saw Clark lay hold of a piece of handkerchiefs, and hand it to Ryan; they came out, and ran across the road - I ran, laid hold of them both, and found the handkerchiefs between Ryan's hips, in his small-clothes.(Property produced and sworn to.)

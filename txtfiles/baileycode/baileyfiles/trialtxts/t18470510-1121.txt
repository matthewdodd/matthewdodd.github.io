ELIZABETH WRIGHT
. I saw the prosecutrix standing opposite a pictureshop—I saw the prisoner make several attempts at her pocket and at other women's pockets—I went down stairs and told the policeman, and he put the prisoners away—in ten minutes the prisoner came back again, and I saw him put his hand down by the prosecutrix's side—I went down to tell the policeman, but he was not on his beat—when I came back the prisoner was standing in the middle of the road—another witness told me something.





MARY WHITE

. The prisoner came there on the afternoon of the 25th of June, and said he should want a bed for the night; he then went out, and returned about half-past ten o'clock - he went to bed, and came down about half-past nine the next morning, and said he should want the bed that night also - he had paid for the bed the night before: I thought he looked rather bulky, ran up stairs, and missed the sheets from the bed he had slept on; I came down, and ran out - I found him in Jermyn-street, collared him, and gave him in charge; we took him to the watch-house, and found the pillow-case in his pocket, the two sheets under his arms, and this blanket round his waist, under his trousers' band.(Property produced and sworn to.)

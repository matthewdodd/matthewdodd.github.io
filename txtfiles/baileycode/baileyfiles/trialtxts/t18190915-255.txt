            . On the 8th of August, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was by the side of the New River at Islington


, and found the two prisoners at my heels - I turned round, and caught Bird concealing my handkerchief, which he had taken from my pocket, I seized him, and charged him with picking my pocket - he said it was not him, it was the other boy gave it to him. We took them both to the watch-house, and gave them in charge.

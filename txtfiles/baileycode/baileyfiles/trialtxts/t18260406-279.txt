            . On Tuesday, the 14th of March, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock at night, I was going down Pear-tree-court, and saw the prisoner loitering about, and knowing there had been a robbery opposite, I went down and asked who he was waiting for - he said I person named Crawley - I had lived there three or four years, and never heard of such a name - I detained him till my son got the watchman - he was taken to the watch-house, where he pulled out the weights - three out of his jacket pocket, and four out of his hat.

            . I apprehended a prisoner, who is not here now, about eight or nine o'clock at night; I know he and the prisoner were in company together.
Prisoner. Q. He stated before the Magistate that the clock was striking nine? Q. I did not; I was at the sign of the Duke of Gloucester public-house, and saw the prisoner come in with a man named Caton.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . My husband's name is John, he is a linen-draper
; the prisoner was our servant
. A gentleman had lost some things, and suspected her; on the 21st of April we searched her drawer, and found a remnant of Irish cambrick, two yards and a half of it, (produced in court and deposed to) this I had put by in the parlour, in order to make up for my children. The prisoner said she bought it in Holbourn; I found some of my clouts in her trunk, at a chairman's house; she gave me the key to open it; she said they were her mother's, but I have some of the fellows to them at home; I know them to be mine.
Prisoner's defence.
I bought the cloth in Holbourn; the clouts were my mother's.

THOMAS RUSSELL. On the 31st of March I was in Laston-court, Saint Giles


; I had treated the prisoner, and went there with her - I went into her room, and put my own watch and one of my friend's on the table, with a bundle - the prisoner then let in another woman from the passage; that woman held me, while the prisoner took my watch and ran off with it; the woman said it was only done for a lark, and she would fetch her back - she went out, and I did not see them again - the other watch and bundle was left on the table.

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner on the 1st of April - she said she had been with this man, and that he had got his watch and bundle; I said, "But you have got the other watch;" she said No; the prosecutor appeared sober, and gave a good description of her.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw him in a public-house with another woman - he went to my room with another woman; I returned to the public-house, and afterwards heard of the robbery.

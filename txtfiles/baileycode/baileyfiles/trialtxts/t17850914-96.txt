                   Finn
               



            's in Blackhorse-yard, and I set down in the house five minutes; I felt something in my pockets, and I jumped up, and felt in my pocket, and missed my money; I was not any way disguised in liquor; I had the money after I went in not five minutes before; I had it in my hand; they ran out of the door, and a man who stood in the door-way before I was robbed, tripped up my heels, and set his feet on my breast as I was going out; I never recovered any part of my money; they offered me four guineas of the money afterwards, but the justice told me I must not take it; it was the day they were sent to prison; they were taken three days after the robbery, and they sent a man with the money; I had seen both the prisoners before.
By what light did you see them? - By the light of the lamp; I am quite sure they are the two women; I looked at the place where I sat, there was no money there, I looked on the bed, and there was none there.
Did any thing pass between you and either of them before you were robbed? - No; the prisoner

             said that she had two shillings of the money, and that the other had all the rest.
What did the other say? - The other said nothing.
Did either of them deny being in the room with you? - No.
PRISONER LANGLEY's DEFENCE.
I served two years to my business; I had been to carry some work home, coming along the man met me; he took hold of of me; I said I was going home; he said he had been robbed in this place; I do not know by whom; he had been knocking at several peoples doors; he followed me home, and I stopped, and got me a halfpenny candle, and I went and unlocked my door; this man followed me in, he sat down on a box that stood by my bed-side, I told him, says I, I will be very much obliged to you to go out of my house, I wanted to go to bed, he asked me for a bit of candle, and I locked my door and went to bed; he never took me up till Monday, and then I asked him what for, and he said he had been robbed, and whether it was us or not, he would make us pay for it.

He put two shillings into my hand to shew him where he was robbed; I told him I did not know: he went round to every place; he was very much in liquor; he asked three guineas to make it up.

Is there any truth in these stories? - None.

Court. Let the other witnesses for the prisoner go out of court till they are called.
Smith. On Friday night, about a quarter after eleven, I was standing at one Mrs. Taylor's door, who keeps a chandler's shop, a man came and knocked at the door facing that, which is a farrier's shop, Mrs. Taylor says, what do you want there, says he, I have been robbed of my money, Mrs. Taylor says, you have not been robbed there, and I made answer, and said, good man, you could not be robbed here, for that is a farrier's shop; there is nobody lives there; with that, he says, I am sure I have been robbed here, then, says he, I have been robbed some where about here; says I, do you know who robbed you, why, says he, it was a tall woman, with a dark complexion, and her hair was very curly here (and he put his hand to his head, as I may do now) and a man; I said, should you know the party again, I do not know whether I should or no, says he; but are you sure they robbed you, says I; yes, says he, because I felt a woman's hand in my pocket, and she slid it away, and the man put his leg out, and he tripped me up, and I fell down, and I could not see any more of them; with that the prisoner, whose name is 
               
                  Jenny
                   Langley
               



             I think; I know all my neighbours; I know her very well by sight; I never spoke to the woman before that night she came to the chandler's-shop; but whether she bought a candle or no I do not know; says she, I am going home; this good man that stands here says, I will go home along with you if you have a mind, she says yes, with that they went to her lodging, and I am obliged to go by their door to go home; I bought a candle at the chandler's-shop, and went home into the prisoner's apartment to light it, and I looked at the man, and I says to him, good man, you are the man that was robbed; yes, says he, and I have got no money now; he was i woman's apartment; no body was in the room besides the two prisoners; the woman makes an answer directly, and says, then if you have no money you cannot expect to stay here, go about your business; he directly replied, I have no money, for I have been robbed of five guineas and odd.
Court. What was the woman's name whose shop you was at? - Mrs. Taylor, I expect her here.
Whose house was it that the man was knocking at opposite? - I do not rightly know the man's name; he has a shop facing Mrs. Taylor's; he lodges at Mrs. Taylor's; he knocked at the door a great while, almost fit to split the door down.
Was there any body else of the neighbours that was alarmed and came out? - Yes, there is a woman.
What is her name? - I do not know, I should know her if I was to see her.
Prisoner. Her name is 
               
                  Mary
                   Jones
               



            .
Court to Smith. Was she present when the conversation passed between the prosecutor and Mrs. Taylor? - No, nobody was present but Mrs. Taylor; this woman said the prosecutor came and knocked at her door.
How long have you worked in that neighbourhood? - Better than a twelvemonth, a twelvemonth last August.
You know the neighbours very well then? - I keep but a little acquaintance with any of them.
Whose house did this prisoner Langley live in? - I do not know the name of the landlord, 
               
                  Mary
                   Finn
               



             lives over the broad-way, she does not live in the same place with Langley.
How far is that off? - As far as it is from here to the pump going to St. Sepulchre's.
Did you see her at all that night? - No, I did not.
How long have you known Langley? - I believe I have known her about three or four months.
Do you lodge there as well as work there? - I have a house there, I have a little house, and I live in there, my wife and I.

Is your master here? - No, he has lived in Black-horse-yard ten years.
How do you spell your master's name? - Upon my word I do not know, I am no schollar, Kellyan.
That is not an Irish name, Kelly is? - His name is 
               
                  Cornelius
                   Callagan
               



            .
Then you did not see anything of 
               
                  Mary
                   Finn
               



             that night? - No, I did not, I never saw any harm of either of the women, they always behaved as they ought to do.
This man said he had lost all his money, and he had no money left? - Yes.
Then it is not true that he gave 
               
                  Mary
                   Finn
               



             two shillings, to help him to look for his money with a candle? - Not while I was by.
Court to Robinson. Did you ever see that man before? - Yes.
Where did you first see him? - The first time I saw him was at the King's Arms in East Smithfield, the day that the prisoners were taken up.
You did not see him before? - Not to my knowledge.
He was not at the door and tripped up your heels? - I have no recollection of that man, he came up and offered me four guineas to make it up and not to appear, and I sent in to the Justice.
What did he say? - He offered me four guineas not to appear against the prisoners.
Was any body present when he made that offer? - Yes, there was one Brown, that was with him, and one Mr. Burton, a master blacksmith at Blackwall, but he is lame and not able to come.
Was there anybody present with you here now? - No, Sir, nobody at all, this man himself went to the Justice, to ask whether I might take the money or not.
Court to Smith. How came you to make this offer on behalf of the prisoner? - My Lord, I never made such an offer.
Then this is false? - It is as false as God is in Heaven.
You recollect there are two witnesses in this case, mind, though Mr. Burton is not here now, he can be found hereafter; now will you swear, you never made such an offer? - I will, all my goods and clothes would not fetch it, I did not make the offer.
You swear that positively? - Yes, neither did I go to the Justice, I was not with them when they took the girls up.
Were you ever, at any time with the prosecutor at the King's Arms in East Smithfield? - I saw him there, he came in there, but I never spoke to him, nor drank with him, he gave the girls something to drink.
You never spoke to him in the King's Arms? - I never spoke to him in the King's Arms.
Then you positively swear that you never made him such an offer, nor never spoke to him at the King's Arms? - I never did; at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



             I spoke to him, we had sixpenny-worth of gin and water, or something, I do not know what it was.
Did you make him that offer at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



            ? - No.
What conversation passed? - I will tell you; there was one Brown, and he and I went over to the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



            , and there was the prosecutor and another man sitting, and I called for a pint of beer, and we had sixpennyworth of something, and he offered his own self, that if the girls would make the four guineas up before the trial came on, he would not appear against them, with that I said, I would go and speak to the girls, and I went to the girls where they were in the lock-up place in the King's Arms, and they said they could not do any such thing, they had no money, they were not guilty, and could not get any money.
Then it is not true that Robinson sent over to the Justice's, to ask whether he might take the money or not? - I do not know.
Court to Robinson. Was it at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



            , or the King's Arms, that he offered you the money? - It was at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear

             sworn.
On Friday night my husband and me were in bed.
Court. Before you give your evidence, hear what I have to say to you; be cautious what you say, I have two other witnesses that have been examined before, you have not heard their examination, they have contradicted each other very materially; I wish to save you from the guilt of perjury: I have ordered them to be detained in Court, with an intention of committing them to Newgate for perjury, if the Jury does not believe their evidence, and if you should give an evidence that the Jury should not believe, you will share the same fate; now, with that caution, if you wish to be examined, it is upon your own head.
Mr. Jones. I shall speak nothing but truth; on Friday night about a quarter after 11; I was in bed and asleep, and my husband likewise, and some person knocked at the door, I asked who was there, and the man said he was a friend, and I immediately asked him what he wanted; he said to come in doors; my husband asked him what he wanted; he said no more; he went to the next door to Mr. West's, who is an elderly old gentleman, and his wife is old, and she spins; he knocked at the door and begged for a bit of candle, and they gave him a bit, and he came to my door again with a light in his hand, and I said to my husband, get out and see what the gentleman wants, and he got out in his shirt, and I got out in my shift, and stood behind the door, and my husband said, friend what is that you want, and he said he had been robbed, and my husband said, friend, was you robbed here, and he looked about a bit, and he said no, he was not; he went away, and I shut the door and went to bed, and I know no farther.

I live in Mountague-street, White-Chapel; I am a housekeeper, I am a tambour worker; I have known the prisoner Langley ever since the expiration of her apprenticeship, that was in 1777, she has worked with me three different times; I have trusted her with every thing I had, and she behaved honest and just.
Prisoner Finn. Ask the prosecutor if he did not pawn his watch that night to sleep with a girl three doors from me.

Prosecutor. I have not had a watch for these fifteen or sixteen years, and more than that I slept at home that night.

Court. In the first place let the officers take Smith and Taylor into custody, and commit them to Newgate.
Court to Prisoner. Now as to you prisoners, I think it right that these persons who have been the hearers of your defence, and of your trial, should also be the hearers of your sentence, for this Court has always made it a rule, wherever they detect persons committing the crime of perjury in order to clear prisoners, to punish those prisoners who set up such defences in the severest manner; had you been convicted of this offence unaggravated with the crime of perjury, the Court would probably have thought, that whipping each of you, with six, or at most twelve months confinement in the house of correction, would have been a sufficient punishment of your offence, but the Court consider your perjured defence, in which opinion I must entirely concur with the Jury, so great an aggravation of your guilt, that the Court must pass an additional punishment upon you; therefore the sentence of the Court is, that you and each of you be 



               transported beyond the seas for the term of seven years to such place or places as his Majesty, by the advice of his Privy Councel shall think fit to declare and appoint
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

CHARLES OVENS
. My father's name is William Ovens, he is a boot and shoe maker. On the 18th of February I saw the prisoner take my father's boots from the board outside—he ran away—I told my father—I followed him—he was taken to Bow-street—I am sure he is the person—these are the boots—(looking at them.)





WILLIAM OVENS
. I am master of the shop—it is in Newton-street, Holborn—my son called out "Father!"—I went out and saw the prisoner—I ran after him and called "Stop thief"—the policeman caught him, and he dropped these boots from under his arm—they are mine.





JOHN LAURIERE
 (police-constable F 120.) I took the prisoner, and have the boots.

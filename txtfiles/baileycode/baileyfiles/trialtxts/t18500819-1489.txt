JAMES GATE
. I am assistant to John Gate, a hosier, of 4, Glasshouse-street, Regent-street. On the evening of 18th July, about six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop—he bought a tie, paid for it, and left—Hardwick soon after came in, and I missed this piece of black silk (produced)—it is John Gates's property.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Is there any mark on it? A. No.





THOMAS HARDWICK
 (police-constable, D 7). On Thursday evening, 18th July, I was outside Mr. Gates's shop, and saw the prisoner sitting down inside—I saw him take something from the counter, and put it into hat,

which was between his legs—he soon after left the shop—I spoke to Gates, and went after the prisoner, and saw him put something into a handkerchief—I overtook him in Vere-street, and asked him what he had got—he said, "What do you think?"—I took this silk (produced) from his hand tied, up in a new handkerchief.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his house? A. Yes—I found he kept a rag-shop—there were some old articles of dress there.





JOHN LEWIS
 (City policeman, 431). I produce a certificate (read—Moses Nathan, convicted here July, 1847, and Confined Six Months)—the prisoner is the person.

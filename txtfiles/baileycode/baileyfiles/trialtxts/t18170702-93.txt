FRANCIS OXLEY. I live in Addington-place, Camberwell. On the 24th of June, I was walking very fast by
Postern-row, Tower-hill


; all of a sudden, I felt my pocket lightened and missed my handkerchief, I turned round, and saw the prisoner conveying it into his bosom; I laid hold of him and secured him with it; he said it was given to him-two Jews were near him, and desired me to give him a kick and let him go about his business-they were very impertinent-the prisoner also desired I would give him a kick and let him go. I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

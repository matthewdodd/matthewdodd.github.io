 for stealing 40 yards of cloth, value 15l.; the goods of 



Thomas Tillman, in his dwelling-house.






JAMES BATTLEBURY
. I am in the employ of Thomas Tillman, a tailor, of 200, Whitechapel-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel, it is his dwelling-house. On 1st Nov., about half-past six o'clock, the prisoner came in, said, "Good evening," took up eight lengths of cloth, and ran out—I am lame, and before I could get up he was half way out of the shop—I called, "Stop thief!" but could not find a policeman—a parcel of boys surrounded me—I afterwards recognized him at the Mansion-house—I know him by his cap and dress, and also by his features—this is like the cap (produced)—I was discharged in consequence, as it was thought I had a hand in it, but have been taken back.





WILLIAM LOCKYER
 (City policeman, 264). On 10th Nov. the prisoner was in my charge at the Mansion-house in the other case; Battlebury was brought there and identified him.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

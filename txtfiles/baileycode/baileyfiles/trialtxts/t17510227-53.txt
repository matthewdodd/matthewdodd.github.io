Peter Dodd. I lost a saw six weeks ago last Saturday.
Q. Where do you live?
Dodd. I live in Shoreditch


, I am a wheelwright
, after I missed it, I was told it was at Mr. Hambleton's house; I went there last Monday and found it. The saw produced in court and deposed to. I lost three saws that week.
Q. What do you imagine is the value of that saw?
Dodd. It is worth three shillings.
Q. How came you to charge the prisoner with taking it?
Dodd. It was bought of the prisoner.
Mr. Hambleton. I bought the saw of the prisoner for three shillings, he told me he was a block-maker
, and he had better sell his tools than go a thieving, he had another good saw at the same time in his sack.
To his Character.

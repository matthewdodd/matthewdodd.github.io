. I am errand-boy to Mr. Thomas Mitchell, of Great Turnstile—he is a tailor. On the 31st of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner take this shooting-jacket off a block in the doorway—he took it along the ground, and walked away with it—I ran after him, and called, "Stop thief"—I snatched the jacket from him—I caught hold of his coat, and somebody else caught his hand.





THOMAS MITCHELL
. I am owner of this shop. This is my jacket—I do not know the prisoner—I was in another part of my shop, talking to my landlord at the door, and my boy said, "That is the man that took the coat"—I followed him through Titchbourne-court, which is about twenty yards from my shop—there was not a soul in the court but him—I never lost sight of him—there was a man at the extremity of the court, ready to knock him down-by the time I got to tbeend of the court, he was stopped.

Prisoner. He said that the boy said there were three of us at the window, and that it was passed from one to the other. Witness. The boy stated there were three together, and one of them struck him on the hand, to try to get the coat from him, but he held it too tight.





STEPHEN LONGHURST
. I was coming up Holborn, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner came out of a court, I tripped him up, and the prosecutor came up and gave him into custody.





WILLIAM HENRY MATTHEWS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.

JOHN EDWARD RIGBY
. I live in Shoreditch, and am an ironmonger. At a quarter before nine o'clock, on the 11th of August, I was passing through Norton-falgate; a woman spoke to me, and I saw the prisoner running; I pursued, and caught him—I found a handkerchief on him—it is the same pattern as the one I had just lost—but has no mark on it—I believe it is mine—I had seen it half-an-hour before—I charged the prisoner with stealing it, before it was found—he said he knew nothing about it—it was between his legs, inside his trowsers.

Prisoner. I picked up the handkerchief, and put it into my pocket.





FREDERICK EAGER
 (police-constable H 52.) I was called, and took the prisoner—I asked him if he had taken the handkerchief; he said, "No;" and showed me an old one, and said he had none other—I searched, and found this one between his legs, under his trowsers—I produce the ocrtificate of the prisoner's former conviction, by the name of W. Clark—he is the same man.(read)

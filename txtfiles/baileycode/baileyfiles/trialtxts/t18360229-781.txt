JOHN PHILLIPS
 I live in Great Chapel-street, Westminister, and an a broker. The prisoner was my shopman—I took him from a neighbour, by whom he was discharged for stealing a penny—I thought it was trifling, and looked ever it—I missed a handkerchief on the 27th of February—I went to his lodging, and found an umbrella and two printed books, a rule, some buttons, and other things, which were mine—the girl, who was a fellow-servant, of his, told me he lodged there—I found them in a house in the New-cut, Tothill-street, Westminister—I cannot tell the number—I charged him with stealing the handkerchief—he said he had pawned it—I never saw him at the lodgings I went to—I knew none of the boxes that were there to be his, nor any of the articles that were in them.





WILLIAM STEBBINGS
 I am shopman to Mr. Harlow, a pawnbroker, of York-street. I have a handkerchief pledged by the prisoner in the name of George Taylor.

Prisoner. I did take that, but not the other things. WILLIAM ARNANDELL (police-constable B.86.) I took the prisoner for stealing the handkerchief, and these other things. He entreated Mr. Phillips to forgive him or pawning the handkerchief—I searched him and found a shilling, which he said he got for the handkerchief—I asked the prisoner what he did with the duplicate—he said he had torn it up.





RICHARD MOORE
 (police constable B18.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction for felony, which I got from Clerkenwell—the prisoner is the person (read).

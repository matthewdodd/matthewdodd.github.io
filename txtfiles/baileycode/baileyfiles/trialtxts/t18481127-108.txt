JOSEPH SLATE
,




 GEORGE TAYLOR
, and 




HENRY SUTMIRE



, stealing, 58 yards of Orleans cloth, value 2l. 10s.; the goods of 



William East White.






WILLIAM HENRY WHITE
. I live with my father, William East White, a draper, in the Kingsland-road. On 16th Nov., about half-past two, I received information, ran into the road, and saw the prisoners running away together—Slate and Sutmire had two pieces of cloth each—I pursued them into Albion-square, and lost sight of them just as they turned the corner—I turned and saw them again, caught them, and gave them all in custody—there were four at first.





GEORGE KNIGHT WHITE
. I am one of the prosecutor's sons. I ran with my brother and picked up these two pieces of cloth, which I had seen safe two hours before.





ROSINA ANN TYLER
. I live near Mr. White. I was at my window, and saw the prisoners come from his shop—one of them had something under his apron—I told Miss White.





ROBERT FORD
 (policeman). Mr. White gave Slate and Taylor into my

charge—Sutmire was brought to the station in five or ten minutes with these pieces of cloth.





WILLIAM THORNELL
 (policeman). I produce a certificate of Taylor's conviction—(read—Confined one month and whipped)—he is the person.

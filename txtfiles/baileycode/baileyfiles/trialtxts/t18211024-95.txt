            . I am one of the night patrol. On the 10th of October, a little after two o'clock in the day, I was returning from the Mansion-house, and stopped the prisoner in Lamb's-passage, Chiswell-street, with a bundle - I asked what was in it, he said dirty linen; I asked what sort, he said he did not know, that he had brought it from his sister's, who lived in Whitechapel, and he lived in Grub-street, and had been walking round Hoxton - it contained these things.

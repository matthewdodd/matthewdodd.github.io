            . On the 13th of October, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner unhook a ham from the door-post of Mr. Gates' shop; I was within four or five yards of him - I sprang forward; he threw it down, and ran - I pursued, and took him at the corner of Church-street; there was another man with him, who made his escape.

            . I assisted in taking the prisoner - I went to the shop and got the ham.

            . I am the wife of Richard Gates. There were three hams hanging on the window-post - this was the middle one; I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was working till nine o'clock, when I went to get half a pint of coffee - I came out, went a yard or two, and heard a person call Stop thief! I ran to the corner of Church-street, and some persons caught me; I never saw the ham till I was at the watch-house.

            . I am a widow
. I was walking in Soho-square


 on the 10th of July, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon; I had my reticule in my hand- it contained a snuff-box, a handkerchief, a purse, and a sovereign; the prisoner snatched it, and ran away - I gave an alarm, and the witness caught him immediately; I am certain he is the man.

            . I was in Soho-square, and saw the prisoner running, not far from the lady; I ran, stopped him, and brought him back - I took his hat off, and took this property from it.

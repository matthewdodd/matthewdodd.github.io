.
Q. Do you remember going up into the bed-room on the 17th of September, in the afternoon - A. I do; about four o'clock. The first thing I saw was my husband's watch with a gold key, a great coat, a new coat, a pair of smallclothes, two waistcoats, a sheet, and five neck handkerchiefs; one a silk one. I saw all the things then. I locked the room door about four o'clock; I had made the bed. I went down stairs; I left the room door locked.
Q. In what part of the room was the watch - A. It hung on the chimney-piece. I missed these things at eleven o'clock; when I went to bed.

            . I am the husband of the last witness. When we went to bed, I went to wind up my watch; it was gone. All I know is, the articles were missing; I have seen part of them since.

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 17th of September, between eleven and twelve at night, Mr. Dunkley came to me; I went with him; but I made no discovery until Monday. I had some information that the prisoner and another woman had been selling some clothes; I apprehended the other woman first, and when I went to No. 5, Leg-alley, where the prisoner had lodged; she was gone from there; I then went to a court in Clare-market, there I found the prisoner in bed. In that room I found a waistcoat; Mr. Dunkley was with me; he said, it was his, he had had it fourteen years. I took the prisoner in custody, and likewise the woman who had purchased the things of her; the other woman acknowledged that she had purchased them of the prisoner, a coat, waistcoat, and smallclothes, for her husband. I took with me the waistcoat only; there was no other clothes there. Mrs. Homer said the things should be forth coming. In about half a hour after, Mrs. Homer, the landlady, came up to the watchhouse, and brought me a pair of smallclothes; she requested me to look in the pocket; in the pocket of the breeches, I found a duplicate of a blue coat; the blue coat and the breeches are here. Mrs. Dunkley went with the duplicate, and took her husband's blue coat out; she did not understand it. I produce the blue coat, waistcoat, and breeches.
Prosecutor. They are mine. I have never seen my watch again, nor my great coat again.

            . I live at No. 17, Broad-street, Bloomsbury. I lodge with Mrs. Hians.
Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have seen her; I never spoke to her before Mrs. Hians sent me to her, to get her daughter's clothes that she had enticed away. On Sunday morning, the 19th of September, I went for the young woman's clothes; I went to No. 5, Leg-alley, Long Acre; I found the prisoner in bed; I told her that Mrs. Hians had sent me for her daughter's clothes; the prisoner told me to tell Elizabeth Hians to keep out of the way, it was a pity she should be taken up, as she knew nothing of the robbery. The prisoner told me, she herself, committed the robbery; she said, she took some keys, she unlocked the door, put on her apron to bring the property away, and she locked the door, and took the keys back again; she expected Mr. Dunkley up to search the room, but they could not find any thing in the room; she had sold all the property, but the sheet she had pledged; she did not say where. She gave me 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Hians
               



            's things; she told me to tell 
               
                  Betty 
                  Hians
               



             to swear she did not know her, as she supposed 
               
                  Betty 
                  Hians
               



             would be taken up, because she lived with her. She told me that 
               
                  Betty 
                  Hians
               



             was never near the place. She saw a man painting the door; he said to her, am I in your way; she said, no; but he little thought she had his property.

                  HOMER
               



            . On the 18th of September, the prisoner brought me a coat, and a pair of small clothes, I gave her ten shillings for them; the waistcoat she gave me in with the clothes. I bought them for my husband; after I had bought them my husband pledged the coat. She was taken up in my place.

MATILDA MASKALL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of October, 3 pairs of shoes, value 4s. 8d., the goods of 



Joseph Johnson; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY LANG
. I am shopman to Mr. Joseph Johnson, of Long Acre. On the 7th of October we had three pairs of shoes in the shop—I saw them safe at four o'clock in the afternoon—they were missed soon afterwards—these now produced are them.





SAMUEL JONES
. About a quarter-past four o'clock that afternoon, I was coming down Long Acre, I saw the prisoner take the shoes and put them under her shawl—I gave information.





HENRY FITCH
 (police-constable F 111.) I took the prisoner—I found these three pairs of shoes under her arm, under her shawl.

Prisoner. I was going along, and the witness asked how I came by the shoes; I said I picked them up against a public-house, in brown paper; he asked me if I would give him part of them, if not, he would give me in charge; I would not; he crossed over and gave information; the name of the witness is not Jones, it is Jago; he lives in Little Charles-street, Drury-lane, and has been convicted.





SAMUEL JONES

re-examined. My father-in-law's name was Jago—I am a glass-cutter—I never was convicted.





GEORGE FOREY
 (police-constable S 241.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.





GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

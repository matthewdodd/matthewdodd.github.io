CHARLOTTE PAGET
. I am the wife of Charles William Stephen Paget, a tobacconist in Fetter-lane. About half-past three o'clock, on the 18th of February, I heard a noise in the shop—I looked up, and saw the prisoner in the shop—he had opened the guard, and taken out a box containing eighty-six cigars—I saw the box in his hand, and saw him put it into a basket—I followed him across the road—he turned round and saw me coming—I called out, "Stop thief"—he ran up Greystoke-place—a person coming down prevented him going up—he threw the box of cigars into an area—they were picked up and given to me.





RICHARD ROWELL
 (police-constable F 114.) I received the prisoner, and the cigars.





ISAAC NOBLE
 (City police-constable, No. 318.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

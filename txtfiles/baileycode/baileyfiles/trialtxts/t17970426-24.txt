             sworn. - I am a dyer
, in Houndsditch. On the 24th of February, my child was sent out for a halfpenny-worth of cakes, she is about two years and an half old, it was only four doors from the end of the court, that was between ten and eleven o'clock; I was told in about four minutes after that a woman had run away with the child; I went up Houndsditch and found the child by herself without her frock. I saw the prisoner turn out of the court, and I suspected her, and followed her, I saw the frock stuck in her bosom; I took it from her, and sent for an officer.
(Richard Nibley, the constable, produced the frock, which was deposed to by the prosecutor).
The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.

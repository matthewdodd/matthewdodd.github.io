            . I am a coal-merchant
. On the 26th of August, about a quarter past nine o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Neptune-street, Ratcliffe-highway, walking with a lady, my daughter and another lady were behind, and behind them my son. Just as I got round the corner into Wellclose-square


, I saw three boys apparently at play, one (the prisoner) ran between me and the wall, stooped down so as to get under my arm, and snatched at my seals, the chain broke, he got part of it with the keys and seal, I immediately turned round and called "Stop thief, I am robbed;" he nearly knocked my daughter down. My son hearing the cry ran after him, and one of the three came before him, but he was taken without my losing sight of him, the others got away.
- HUMBERT. My father's account is correct, the prisoner is the lad.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking round the square, heard the cry, ran up, and they laid hold of me.

JACOB RUSSELL. I am a pawnbroker
, and live in Fore-street


. On the 4th of March I was returning home, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw a boy on his knees in my shop unpinning this waistcoat - there were three of them in company; I watched them, and saw Mahane take out a pin, and return to Blake, who was watching; he went back again, and took another pin out; came back again, returned a third time, took it quite down, and gave it to Blake, who was pretending to be looking in at the window - I pursued Blake; he at last threw himself down in the mud, and I took him with the waistcoat in his hand - a neighbour took Mahane; I am certain of them both.

            . I am the wife of Joseph Brook, a corn-chandler
, of Poland-street


. On the 24th of September I was in my parlour, between six and seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner in the shop; I thought at first it was our journeyman's boy, and did not go till a person called out, "Mrs. Brook, you are robbed;" he was then at the end of the flour-bin; Beecher had caught him, but found nothing on him; I found in the flour-bin two papers of copper, which I missed from the till; he said he had come in to ask his way to Whitecross-street, but there was nobody to ask.

            . I saw the prisoner in the shop with the coppers in his hand; he went and put them into the flour-bin.

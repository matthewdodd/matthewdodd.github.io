            . I saw a man on the top of the house of Mr. Cellea, cutting off lead, who flung it down, and the prisoner was below picking it up. I went and took her, and she dropt some pieces; upon which I carried her, and some of the lead, to the watch-house, and she was committed.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going to market, and this man said I belonged to a man that was stealing lead on the house, but I knew nothing at all of it.

1829. 




THOMAS DAVIS
 was indicted

 for feloniously forging, on the 
11th of April, a request for the delivery of 5 books of gold, with intent to defraud 



Horace Tabrunn-2nd COUNT, for uttering the same.






HORACE TABRUNN
. I am a gold-beater, and live in Nassau-street, Middlesex Hospital. Hore Browse Frist is foreman to Messrs. Smart, of Titchbourne-street, who are customers of ours. On the 11th of April the prisoner came to my shop and produced a written order, which I produce, directed to me—I looked at it, and delivered him five books of leaf gold on the faith of that—it came to 6s. 7d.—he left the shop with it—read-"To Mr. Tabrunn, 11th of April.-Please send by the bearer five books of gold.—H. B. FRIST, 16, Dean-street, Soho."





HORE BROWSE FRIST
. I am foreman to Messrs. Smart, and live in Dean-street, Soho. I have known the prisoner some years—I did not send him on the 11th of April with this note—he never delivered the gold to me—the note produced is not my hand-writing, nor was it written by my authority.

Prisoner. Q. Some time before did I ask you to let me have goods in your name, and you say I might have anything in your name, and you would do anything you could to serve me? A. No, I did not—I never authorized you to obtain any goods in my name.

Prisoner's Defence. Some time before I asked Mr. Frist if I might get me articles I wanted to make use of; he said anything in his power I

might make use of his name-not having the money, I wrote the order in, his name, intending to pay him.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were three other indictments against the prisoner.)

                  , the 28th of August
 last, and the latter an Accessory after the Fact
            . It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner being Servant
 to the Prosecutor, stole the Goods, and the latter deluded her to do the Fact to give her Money to tell her Fortune, promising her great Things. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them 


               Guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.
             each.

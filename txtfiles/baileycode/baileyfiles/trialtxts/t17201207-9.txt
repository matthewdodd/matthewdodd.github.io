               privately stealing a Bell-Metal Mortar of 103 pound weight out of the Shop of

, on the 30th of November
 last. It appeared that the Prisoner Abraham stole the Mortar and lodg'd it in an Alehouse, then got a Coach, and the Coachman moved it out of the Alehouse into the Coach, Abraham following him, and that Elton was in the Coach; that after they were taken he got away, jumpt over a Wall and made his Escape, but was retaken. He pleaded that he had the Mortar of a Gentleman out of the Country, who desired him to sell it for him; but could not prove it: Elton said that she knew nothing of its being stole, but that Abraham sent for her to go with him to an Acquaintance of hers to the other end of the Town to sell it, and called one to prove it. The Jury considering the matter 

               Acquitted
             Elson, and found Abraham 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

            . I am apprentice to George Breacher, a tailor
, who lives in Little Bell-alley


. On the 14th of February, about seven o'clock, a person came into the shop, and took a pair of trowsers. I only saw his back. I ran out, and cried Stop thief!

            . I was passing Breacher's shop, and saw the prisoner come out, folding something up; I am certain of his person. Breacher came out, calling Stop thief! I turned round; the prisoner ran into a dark passage: I ran by him, turned back right upon him, and secured him. I am positive he is the man - I saw his person plainly.

            . I saw a man come out of the shop. I joined in the pursuit, and stopped the prisoner. I returned, and picked up the trowsers exactly on the spot where he was taken.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

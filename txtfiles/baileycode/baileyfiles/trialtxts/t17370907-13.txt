Richard Cox. I keep a Publick-House
; on Monday the 29th, of August, the Prisoner came in between 1 and 2, after Dinner, and call'd for a Tankard of Beer. I pass'd to and fro' in the House, while he was drinking his Beer, and at last some body call'd me out into the Street: I look'd back and saw the Prisoner go towards the Necessary-House in the Yard. When I went in again, I met the Prisoner coming out: I observ'd his Coat was then button'd up close, when he came in it was open. Here, says he, take your Reckoning, (and he gave me a Shilling) if a Man in a green Coat should come to ask for me, tell him I am gone. But seeing something button'd up in his Coat, I pull'd it open, and found these Six Plates upon him. I carry'd him before Sir 
               
                  Richard 
                  Brocas 
               



            , and there he own'd he took them, and said he did it out of Necessity, - and the like.
Defence. My Lord, there was a young Man with me, and it was he that gave me the Plates: Says he to me, there are some Plates in the Yard, we'll have half a Dozen of them: I bid him let them alone, but he would take half a Dozen, and then he gave them to me, and I put them in my Bosom. - Here Mr. Cox, you did not give me my Change out of the Shilling, I gave you for the 3 Pints of Beer, I hope you'll give it me now.
Cox. Aye, - Here's your Change, - and I thank you for leaving the silver Tankard behind you.

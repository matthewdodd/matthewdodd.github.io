            . I am an officer. On the 30th of July, I was in Whitechapel - I know Mr. Bruce, he lives at Whitechapel-road


, and is a salesman. I saw the two prisoners come up to his shop - they passed it too and fro, in conversation together. I saw Lamb take this jacket, and put it into his apron. I ran across the road, and took hold of them both together.
Prisoner LAMB. Q. Did you see Orson along with me? A. Yes - he was about a yard or a yard and a half from him at the time he took the jacket.

            . I am an officer, and was with Keys; what he has stated is correct. I had seen the prisoners in company together for days before.

                  BRUCE
               



            . I keep a shop in Whitechapel-road. I missed this jacket from the front of my shop - I know it to be mine.
LAMB's Defence. I was destitute of house and harbour. I had applied to the Tower to be sent to the Navy, and they would not receive me, being wounded through my left leg; and, seeing the jacket, I was tempted by hunger and starvation to take it. I was paid off at Yarmouth some months ago. Orson was not with me - he only came and asked me the occasion of the mob.
ORSON - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 28.
LAMB - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 29.

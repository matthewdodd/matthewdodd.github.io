            . I am a patrol of St. Giles'. I was standing at the corner of Turnstile


, between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday evening, the 7th of May - I saw the prisoner and four others following two gentlemen; I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from one of the gentlemen's pockets - he put it into the flap of his breeches, and they all ran across the road; I pursued, and took hold of the prisoner, with this handkerchief in his hand - he had not got it into his breeches. The other four surrounded me, and struck at me with sticks, but I got him into a cook-shop - he directly laid hold of a knife, and I cut my hand in getting it from him.
Prisoner. He twisted my handkerchief tight round my neck, and I took hold of the knife to cut it. The handkerchief is mine - I had bought it - I stood at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane, and was folding it up to go round my neck.
DANIEL REARDON re-examined. I called to the gentleman, and thought I should have been able to have got the prisoner up to him, but I was not.

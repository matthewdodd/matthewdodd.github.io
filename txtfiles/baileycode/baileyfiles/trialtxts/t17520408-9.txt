Charles Batchelder. I was going for a bottle of water, March 23, between seven and eight at night, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Rawlinson's cellar with a jarr of raisins on his shoulder, I saw him cross the way to come round to Mincing-lane, then he came back again, I went into the shop and told the people there.


                  William 
                  Helaby 
               



            . That boy came and told us a man had gone out of the collar with a of raisins, and if I would run I might catch him, I ran and went past him, he was then coming out of Mincing-lane, the boy said that is he, I said hold on the prisoner, the prisoner said he was going into White-chapel, and that he came from the water side.
Q. How does this cellar door open?
Holaby. It opens into the street, and was open at that time.
Q. Are you sure the raisins and jarr were taken out of Mr. Rawlinson's cellar?
Helaby. It had on it the same mark as the other had which were then near the cellar door
Prisoner's defence.
I was going down to the water side to see for work, it was duskish; there was a man dress'd much like a carpenter, he asked me if I would earn 3 d. or 4 d. I said with all my heart; then he said he would pay me if I would carry that jarr to White-chapel, and said he would be there as soon as I. I came up Mincing-lane, and coming by Mr. Rawlinson's door, they stopp'd me.

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road


, and am a silversmith
. On the evening of the 17th of March I missed this eight-day dial from my shop - I saw it safe near six o'clock, and missed it soon afterwards; it has my name and address on it - it is worth 4l.; I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Young and Luxmore, pawnbrokers, in St. Martin's-lane. I have an eight-day dial, which I took in pawn on the 17th of March, of the prisoner, about seven o'clock in the evening; I lent 1l. 10s. on it - I asked where he got it; he said he had made it for Mr. Stiles, whose name was upon it, but he was not within, and he would take it out again when he was within - I have not the least doubt of the prisoner's person; this is the counterpart of the duplicate I gave him.

            . I took the prisoner on the 18th of March, about seven o'clock - I found on him this duplicate of the dial.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I never had it in my possession, nor saw it before - this prosecutor was convicted here himself twelve months ago.

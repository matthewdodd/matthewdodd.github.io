                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  James 
                  Bradshaw 
               



            ) Had you any Good stole from you?
Bradshaw . Yes, Sir, the Prisoner, Susannah Jones, liv'd with me as a Servant
 about twelve Months: After she left my Service she went, and was inform'd, to live with Mr. Godwin, who suspecting that she had robb'd him of a great many Goods, of a considerable Value, he got a Search Warrant, and found her Place of Rendezvour, in which Place were several Goods that to him; upon which he came to me, and me if I had lost such Goods at the Time that she liv'd with me?
Q. How long was it after she left your Service that Mr. Goodwin told you that she had stole any thing from him?
Bradshaw. I believe it was two Years afterwards . When Mr. Godwin came to me, I told him I had lost some remarkable Silk, which my W had in her Gown. Mr. Godwin told me, upon searching at Chelsea , where she had a Bastard Child at Nurse, that her Child had the Skirt of a Coat of a remarkable fine Silk; upon which I desir'd him to bring it to my House at London; by comparing it, we found it to be the very same Silk which had lain by as useless, 'till we should make it up for Child of our own.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Judith 
                  Simson 
               



            ) What have you got there?
Simson. The Skirt, my Lord, of 2 Child's Coat that Mrs. Jones brought to my House at Chelsea Mr. Godwin's Man found it at my House.
Q. When did she bring it?
Simson . A great while ago, I can't tell the Time; it may be Half, or three Quarters a Year; it was made as it is, for the Child to wear.
Court . Recollect how long it was ago.
Simson. I know it was before last Summer: I nurs'd the Child for her; the Child is almost four Years old.
Q. Was that Silk ever search'd for, or demanded by you?
Simson. Yes, my Lord, they went and took an Inventory of the Child's Things.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  John 
                  Manning 
               



             ) Do you know any thing of that Silk? Where did you find it?
Manning . I found it at Mrs. Simson's, at Chelsea ; I went there to enquire after 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Jones 
               



            , the Prisoner at the Bar: Going there the Woman told me she should see her the Tuesday following, in the City , or at her House; I was there before Eight o'Clock; so she took a Pair of Oars to go to see Susannah Jones, and I took another to follow her . I said to the Waterman, keep up close, I will pay you something extraordinary for it. The Man being acquainted with the other Waterman, ask'd him where he was bound for? he answer'd, Blackfryers ; so I said to my Waterman, You land where the other lands. When she got out of the Boat, I dogg'd her up Blackfryers , and from thence to the Saracen's-Head on Snow-hill. I sent to my Master, and told him I had set Mrs. Jones; there I waited some Time, and they went from thence into Newgate-Street , and from thence to the Harrow in Greyfryers ; she saw me, and went to run down that Place; I said, Mrs. Susan, you shall go no further, you shall not slip my Hands.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Bradshaw) Have you any Reason to suspect that this Silk was stole from you?
Bradshaw. This Silk was in a Gown for my Wife, 'tis very remarkable; I bought it in France. Another Reason I have to believe it to be the same is, that the whole Breadth is cut, and half the Breadth cut in two.
Q. When was this miss'd?
Bradshaw. It was not miss'd when the Prisoner left my House; it might be about six Months, for my Wife had no Occasion to look after the Silk.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What have you to say in your Defence?
Jones. My Lord, I bought it behind St. Clement's .

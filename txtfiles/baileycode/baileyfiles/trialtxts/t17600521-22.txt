             the evidence, and ask'd me, where I was going? I said to great Marlborough-street: one said to the other d - n you, get up, you can drive well; the coachman came ballowing to us; the 3 soldiers were then turning the coach; the coachman did not come up quite to us; then one said go a little further, you may have another coach near Somerset-house, a little beyond Exeter Change was one; when I was in the coach, Biggs catch'd off my hat, and gave it to Williamson, Williamson ran away with it.

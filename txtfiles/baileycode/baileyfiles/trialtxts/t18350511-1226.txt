BARTHOLOMEW BRYAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of January, at St. Pancras, 13 forks, value 10l.; and 2 spoons, value 15s.; the goods of 



Jane Gordon, his mistress, in her dwelling-house.






MRS. JANE GORDON
. I am a widow, and live in Gower-street, in the parish of St. Pancras. The prisoner was my footman—he came at the end of November—he had the care of my plate, and was a yearly servant—he absconded, without giving me notice, on the 1st of January—I gave information to the police, as I missed the plate, and he was apprehended.





JOHN MILTON
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce a dessert fork and spoon, pawned on the 13th of December, and a tea-spoon on the 19th, by the prisoner.





THOMAS MORLAND
. I am servant to Mr. Jones, of Holborn. I have twelve forks, pawned on the 1st of January by the prisoner.





HENRY BAKER
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 5th of May, in Little Coram-street—he said, "I know what you are come about, I will go with you quietly."





JANE GORDON

re-examined. This plate belongs to me, and has my crest on it—the forks are worth 10l.

Prisoner. It is my first offence—I was labouring under intoxication when I did it—I have a distressed family, and beg for mercy.




GUILTY
. Aged 43.—


Transported for Life.

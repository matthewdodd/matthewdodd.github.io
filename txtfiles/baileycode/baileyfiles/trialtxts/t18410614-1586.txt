JAMES WARE
. I am a printer, living in Clifton-street, north. About eleven o'clock in the evening of the 9th of June, I was passing through Aldgate—there was a reflection from the gas on the pavement—I saw some other person walking by my side, and something dangling in his hand turned, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—he threw it down—I took it up, pursued, and gave him to the police—this handkerchief, now produced, is mine.

Prisoner's Defence. He knocked me down, and said I took his handkerchief—I did not—I was not near him.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I live at Epping. I was on the race-ground, at Enfield-marsh


, on the 17th of September - somebody gave me information - I turned round, and saw my handkerchief on the ground - I took it up - this is it - I had felt it in my pocket ten minutes before.

            . I am a policeman. I was on the race-course, and saw Coppin take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket - he was coming away with it - he gave it to Bowen - I laid hold of them both, and Bowen directly dropped the handkerchief from under his jacket.
Coppin's Defence. He said he saw us take a towel, or something - the magistrate asked why he said it was a handkerchief - he said he thought it might be a towel.

1599. 




JOHN CRUTCHER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of June, 1 hat, value 2s.; and 1 box, value 2d.; the goods of 



James Morris.






JAMES MORRIS
. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at Putney in Surrey. On the 11th of June, I went into the fair-field at Wandsworth, where I had some swings at work—I gave the prisoner, who was with me, my jacket and waistcoat to hold—I told him there was a tobacco-box in the pocket which had a duplicate of a hat in it—he gave me the jacket back again without the box and duplicate—I went to the pawnbroker's the next morning, and my hat had been fetched out.


Prisoner. The clothes were throwing about the field—I picked up this tobacco-box in Mr. Robert's booth.

Witness. I am sure the box was in the jacket pocket when I gave it to him.





JOHN MARTIN
. I bought this box of the prisoner for two-pence.





SAMUEL JAGO
 (police-constable V 47.) I took the prisoner in charge, and received this box from Martin.





CHARLES COURTERIDGE
. I gave the prisoner one shilling for the duplicate of the hat, and went and got it.




GUILTY
 of stealing the box. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

First Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

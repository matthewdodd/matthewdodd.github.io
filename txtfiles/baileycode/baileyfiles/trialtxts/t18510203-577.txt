EDWARD DOWLINO
 (policeman, B 46). On 4th Feb., the day of the opening of Parliament, I was on duty, and saw a horse fall down opposite the House of Lords—there was a crowd—I saw the prisoner go behind Mr. Phillips; he was covered by two other persons—I saw his hand go towards Mr. Phillips' pocket, but cannot say whether he took anything—he left him, went in and out among the crowd a minute or two, and then darted off—I saw Mr. Phillips looking at him—I ran after him, and caught him at the same time that Mr. Phillips did—Mr. Phillips said, "Give me my handkerchief," or "You have got my handkerchief"—the prisoner said, "I hope you will let me go"—I told Mr. Phillips I was a policeman, and the prisoner darted away, and threw this handkerchief (produced) among the crowd—at the station I took this handkerchief (produced) from his trowsers leg.





JAMES PHILLIPS
. I was near the House of Lords on 4th Feb.—a carriage-horse fell down; a crowd was collected, and I missed my handkerchief—a boy pointed out the prisoner—I ran after him, and got up to him at the same time as the policeman—he offered me the handkerchief, and said, "Let me go," or, "Will you let me go"—the policeman took the handkerchief—it is one of these.

Prisoner. Q. Where was I when the lad told you? A. About six yards off, walking quietly; your back was towards me; you ran directly you saw me coming.





WILLIAM ROMAIN
 (policeman, L 38). I produce a certificate from Surrey—(read—William Mayhew, convicted Jan. 1848; confined three months)—I was present; the prisoner is the person.

, and live in Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell. On the 17th of November, between five and six o'clock, I was in Clare-street


. A man in a smock-frock said a man had stolen my handkerchief - he had hold of the prisoner - it was Thompson. I felt, and missed it - it was in my pocket five minutes before. Thompson took it from the prisoner.

            . I am an officer. I was at the corner of Clare-market, and saw the prisoner with two more. I suspected, and watched them. They followed Mr. Powis; one took a handkerchief out of his pocket and handed it to the prisoner, who was behind with the other, covering him. I seized the prisoner and took it from him. I was dressed in a round frock.

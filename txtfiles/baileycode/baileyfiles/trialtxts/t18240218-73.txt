             - we live in Euston-street, Spafields


. On the 23d of December, in the morning, when I got up, upon unlocking the kitchen door, I found the window open, and all the linen, wet and dry, stolen; the window was shut the night before. The prisoner lodged in our back parlour, and had no business in the kitchen. I knocked at her door, and receiving no answer, put my hand to the lock, and found it open; she was gone - I did not see her again till the 14th or 15th of January, when she was in custody, at Mr. Creed's, Gray's lnn-lane - a great deal of my property was produced at Hatton-garden. The value of all that we lost is about 16 l.
Q. If she broke at all, she must have broken out of the house, and not into it - A. The kitchen door was locked, and I had the key, and I found it locked - there were foot marks in the yard near the window, and the trace of a person going to and coming from the window. I was not the first person up.
Cross-examined by MR. SHORT. Q. When you came down it was pretty light - A. It was just before eight o'clock - I saw her about eight o'clock the night before; she came into our parlour - she has not a key of the street door, but one of the lodgers has. I found the door shut when I came down, but not locked, as one of the lodgers go out at six o'clock. I know that the prisoner was at home at half-past ten.
COURT. Q. At what time did you go to bed - A. About eleven o'clock. The window appeared to be pushed up from the outside - it opens inward. No violence was used, either to the street door, or the kitchen door.

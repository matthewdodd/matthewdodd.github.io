118. 




HENRY BARKINS
 was again indicted

 for stealing on the 
10th of November, 4 pairs of forceps, value 2s.; and the goods of 



Dennis Settle, his master.






DENNIS SETTLE
. On the 13th day of November, the day after the prisoner was taken on the previous charge, I missed a hand-vice—I went to the nearest pawnbroker, three or four doors from my house, and found it had been pledged there, with these other articles, which are mine.






CHARLES WALPEN
. I produce these foreceps, this scalpel, and the other articles which were pawned by the prisoner, at different times in the name of John Jones.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Did you take them in yourself? A. I took one in—I was not present when he pawned the others, but I have seen him in the shop repeatedly—I have no doubt he is the person who pawned them.





DENNIS SETTLE
. These are my property.

Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark on them? A. These two have my name on them—they had not been sold—I do not put my name on all I make—these forceps I gave the gentleman, at the London University, to try if they would do and they would not—they were returned slightly soiled—I left them on my bench.

Prisoner. The pawnbroker has false sworn—I never saw him—I certainly entered the shop once, but I did not pawn these things.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

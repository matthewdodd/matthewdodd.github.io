            . I am collector to Mr. Newton, a coal-merchant
. On the 17th of November I took the prisoner into my service as nurse
. On the 20th I looked up the plate to have it cleaned, and missed a spoon. On the 21st I missed a desert spoon and other articles, and charged her with it - she denied it. I found party of the property at the pawnbroker's, who saw her, and said she was the woman. She produced the duplicates.

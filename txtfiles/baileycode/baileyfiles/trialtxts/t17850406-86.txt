Where was that bag put? - In a place in the parlour, which was called the plant.
In what place was this plant? - In the wainscot.
Was it visible to anybody as a cupboard, or was it a secret place? - A secret place.
How did the wainscot open? - There was a little hole at the bottom of it, and one could put in a gimblet, or the point of a knife, and it lifted up, and drew out.

Court. Do you know what was in it? - I heard the rattling of the sound of plate, I did not see it, because it was shut too.

Mr. Silvester. Why Nathan, you did not see the bag brought in? - Where.
Why do not you know where, into the Synagogue? - I saw my master put it in, I could not swear to the bag, I saw my master put a bag in, and I heard the plate rattle, I know it was the same bag.
You was examined I believe by a learned friend of mine, that is not here present, and you admitted you had perjured yourself, over and over again; did not you give a different ac count before Sir Sampson? - No, Sir, I do not know I gave him a different account.
Did not you vary your account before Sir Sampson? - No.
What did you swear before Sir Sampson? - I said then what I say now, no further than about what happened at Kingston.

                   Nathan
               



            , he came up to Sir Sampson's, and said he believed there was a quantity of plate in Mr. Barrah's house, he said it was in the wainscot, and that I was very near the plant when I was there before, he did not say whether it was in a bag or not, and he described to me a little hole over the black part of the wainscot, at the bottom he said, if I found that little hole, that part of the wainscot opened; I went, and Mr. Clark, and two or three more officers, to Mr. Barrah's, both Mr. Barrah and his wife were at home, we told them we came to search the house on information, we were there before eleven the same morning; they both said there was nothing in the house, and that Mr. Clark was very welcome to search, he said there were a few pounds of butter, and that was all they had; they desired that Mr. Clark would search the house, and he turned round to me, and said no, that is the man that is to search it, and Shallard went down into the parlour, and there was a place in the floor, I opened it, it turned up, and I put my arm in as far as I could reach, and Barrah himself went with me, and he said here is nothing indeed, I have nothing in the house; we found nothing in that hole, I then began to look on the wainscot, and it was very dark, and Shallard went to get a candle, and looked about, I then saw the hole in the middle of the wainscot, under the cupboard, near the floor, under the skirting board; I then took my knife, and stuck the top of my knife into the hole, and it slid up, and lifted out at the bottom; I rose up upon my feet, and I found this bag of plate, and thirty-six skins for buck skin breeches, and three bundles of linen, two tied in a handkerchief, and one in a table cloth, I asked Barrah if he knew any thing of the things in that hole, and his answer was, cannot you let them alone; besides these things there was a jack for breaking open doors, and some picklock keys.
Mr. Knowles. Was that bag tied up with any thing? - It was tied up with a piece of black ribbon, which is here now; I said to Barrah, who brought these things to your house? he told me he would tell me, if he could be admitted an evidence, I said do you know who the thieves are? he said he would tell, if he could be admitted an evidence, I told him to go to Mr. Clark; Shallard went and fetched Clark down stairs, and Clark says, what do you think of this Mr. Barrah, and he wanted to be admitted an evidence, and Clark said he would have nothing to do with him.
Mr. Silvester. That information you had from that little Jew boy? - Yes.
What had you said to Barrah, when you came there? - I asked him if he knew who the thieves were.
And it would be better for him? - No, I said nothing that it would be better for him, I do not know that there was any private conversation between Clarke and him, Macmanus was with him, he is here.
- SHALLARD sworn.
On Sunday the 6th of March, I went to Barrah's house, and we searched the house, and found this plate concealed inside the wainscot, I was with him when he found the things; Barrah wanted to be an evidence.
What was the bag tied with? - A black ribbon.
Mr. Garrow one of Prisoner's Council. Would your Lordship ask Nathan, whether he has not perjured himself.
Court. No.

Mr. Garrow. May not I ask him, whether he has confessed that he has perjured himself?
Court. No, you may prove it, but not ask it of himself.

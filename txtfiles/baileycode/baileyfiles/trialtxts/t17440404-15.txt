             was my shop-boy
; I had suspected him of robbing me; and on the 23d of March I searched him (he was committed the 24th ) and found a pair of stockings in one pocket, and a pair of gloves in another. He acknowledged the carrying several pair of stockings to his sister, who is the woman Prisoner. On the 24th, I found in 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Goodman 
               



            's drawers, in her apartment, four pair of childrens stockings - I know them to be mine by the marks; and she had upon her legs a pair of womens knit hose; there was a pair of thread mittins, and a pair of boys worsted hose in pawn.
Q. What did she say when you found them in her custody?
Cooper. I carried her immediately before a Justice, and she acknowledged she had them from her brother, and that she had child him for bringing them; for she believed them to be stolen.
Prisoner Creed. When I carried these to my sister, she checked me very much for it; and said, she was afraid I did not come honestly by them; and I told her I had bought them.

             . I have known 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Goodman 
               



             a great many years, and know her to be a very honest woman, and a very industrious girl, and a person of a very good character; and I do not think she would be guilty of any such thing: I keep the mother of her now.
Q. He says, she acknowledged she believed them to be stolen. What can you say to that?
Broadbent. If she said so, I should think she was not in her senses; for she is a very honest girl.

            . I was servant to a gentlewoman whom she lived with; she behaved honestly, and my mistress said she was a very honest servant, and sent her a shilling, and a piece of roast pork by me, and desired to know where her husband lived.

               guilty.
The Jury recommended Margaret * Goodman to the Court
            . 
 * John Goodman, her husband, fell on his knees, and begged very heartily that the Court would be pleased to order her corporal punishment; but this being an offence against a statute, which makes it Transportation for fourteen years absolutely, the Court could not grant it.

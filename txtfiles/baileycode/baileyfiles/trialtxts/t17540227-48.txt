Hannah Glass. I am a habit-maker
, the Prisoner was servant
 to me between five and six years. I considered him as my servant till the 2d of July last. He came backwards and forwards after that, and I paid him for his attendance; he had not settled his books till about August, at which time he was ill, and had been some time before he had the care of my whole business. He bought in all my goods, served in the shop, and kept my books, and I had very great losses at the time he was my servant, but did not suspect him, till one day, my daughter being at a house in the city, about the 6th of Feb. where was the Prisoner's daughter, who said, she was going to have a new suit of cloaths, of a rich yellow tabby; and that her pappa had had it by him a great while, and it was a whole piece. My daughter told me of it when she came home; and I having lost so many things, that it is impossible to tell my losses; I made diligent search for this piece. I never had but this one piece so rich a yellow silk in my life, I could not find it.
Q. Are you certain it was not sold?


                  Hannah 
                  Glass 
               



            . I am very sure it was not. Then I sent Mr. Manger to the mantua-maker, who, the daughter said, had it to make, for a piece of the silk, to see if it was the silk I had lost, which he did, and I have all the reason possible to believe it my silk which I missed Then I looked over my books to see when this piece came in, and found it came in in Feb. was twelve-month. Then we went and took the silk and the Prisoner before Mr. Fielding, there he was charged with taking it; he said, he bought it of a Jew, in St. Mary-Axe, for seven shillings and sixpence a yard, and that there was thirty-four yards: [she holds it in her hand.] I do verily believe it is my silk. I never since I was in business had but this one piece of such rich yellow silk, for which I gave the maker 11 s. an ell. I got a search-warrant and searched the Prisoner's house, there I found two silk handkerchiefs, one about the Prisoner's head, and the other about his neck, which I can swear to be my property: [she took them both in her hand, and measured them by one in her pocket : they were uncommon ones for largeness.] These I swear are my property. It was a piece of taffaty, of a bad colour, and I had it printed in eight handkerchiefs for my own use. I believe there is none so large, and such as these are, in London.
Q. Did you give the Prisoner these?


                  Hannah 
                  Glass 
               



            . No, I did not. I had lost three out of the eight, and was much inquiring after them to the Prisoner; he said, you have left them behind you, where you go; you having a multiplicity of business, may have forgot them.
Q. Did you ever sell any of these eight handkerchiefs?


                  Hannah 
                  Glass 
               



            . No, I never did. The Prisoner said, he would prove I gave them two to him; he and I have used them to tie up bundles in to carry out goods.
Q. What were each of them worth ?


                  Hannah 
                  Glass 
               



            . I reckon they were worth seven shillings and sixpence each when new. I found a very great deal of goods at the Prisoner's house, which I verily believe to be my property, and such as I had lost, but I will not swear particularly to them.
On her cross-examination she said, she discharged the Prisoner, because he lived at a high rate, and she could not think how that could be; that she had no other yellow tabby silk in her shop, except what was in masquerade-dresses; that she strongly suspected the yellow silk to be hers, from an observation that she had before made, that the salvage was not so good as might have been expected to such a silk. That she does not believe there is another piece of yellow tabby so rich as to match it.
Mr. Lawrence. I made two particular pieces of yellow silk tabby, one for Mrs. Glass, and the other Mr. Henley in Cheapside had. I delivered Mrs. Glass's on the 27th of Feb. was twelve-month; [he takes the piece produced in his hand.] I know it by the silk and the leasures. I am certain this is what was made by my order, and which I sold to Mrs. 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Glass 
               



            : there is no difference in the two pieces, only about a quarter of a yard of the salvage is altered in that of Mr. Henley's, being a mist ake in the woman that warped it; and I had observed it before it went out of my hands; they were made a small matter richer than common. [He produced a small piece cut off of Mr. Henley's piece, and compared it.] It may be seen that nothing but the scissars parted the two pieces, they being wove one after the other. I sent my servant 
               
                  William 
                  Cherry 
               



             with this piece to Mrs. Glass; the price she was to give me was eleven shillings an ell.


                  William 
                  Cherry 
               



            . I am apprentice to Mr. Lawrence, I carried a yellow tabby to Mrs. Glass's about a year ago, but did not see it opened, and delivered to Mr. Lankford at Mrs. Glass's warehouse; I never was there but that time.
Burnham Capling. Mr. Lankford delivered a piece of yellow silk to make up a gown and tail for his daughter; [he looks at the piece:] I think this is the piece. Mr. Manger came and desired I would let him have a pattern of it, and after that it was demanded of me by a constable, and I delivered it to Mr. Manger.


                  John 
                  Manger 
               



            . I went by desire of Mrs. Glass to get a pattern of this yellow silk, I cut it off the fag end. [He looked at the piece of silk.] This is the same I went afterwards for, and Mr. Copling delivered to me; it has been in my custody ever since.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have clear evidence to prove how I came by the silk, and witness to prove the handkerchiefs were given me. Call 
               
                  Mary 
                  Lankford 
               



            .
Council for the Prisoner. If you leave it to me as your council, I am of opinion not to examine her.
Prisoner. I leave it to you.
Court. Now she is here, and the Prisoner desires it, why may she not be examined, as she is sworn ?
Council. Then she shall.


                  Mary 
                  Lankford 
               



            . I am daughter to the Prisoner. I remember one masquerade night Mrs. Glass took them two handkerchiefs out of her pocket and gave them to my father, and bid him keep them to carry out bundles with, and he took and kept them till the officers came and took them away; my father was then in bed. I told him, Mrs. Glass was come; he got up, and pulled them off as usual, and she said, they were her property.
Q. How long ago is it since this masquerade night?


                  Mary 
                  Lankford 
               



            . I believe it was about half a year ago, at Ranelagh.
Q. What time of the year are they there?


                  Mary 
                  Lankford 
               



            . I believe they are always in the summer. I remember Mrs. Glass's coming to our house in a coach in August, she said in my hearing to him, she did not discharge him for any dislike, but for that the world said they were criminally great. My father desired to know who were the authors of such an assertion ? She said, they were gentlemen and men of fortune, which was the reason she would not give up their names. And getting into the coach to go home, she said, she would be a friend to the family.
Q. Did you look upon these handkerchiefs as a gift?


                  Mary 
                  Lankford 
               



            . I did.
Q. How could you do that, when you say she mentioned them to carry out bundles with?
Mary Lankford. It was to carry out bundles with, and to keep them, as I understood it.
On her cross-examination she said, none was in the hearing of this reason of discharging her father, but he, her mother, brother and she.

            , Esq. I have known the Prisoner I believe five or six years at Mrs. Glass's; I have heard her say before this, she believed him to be an honest man.
Mr. Nevil. I live in Newgate-street, I have known the Prisoner twenty years; I never knew any thing to the detriment of his character before this affair.
Mr. Curtice. I am a fishmonger, and lived over-against the Prisoner in Newgate-street, about twenty years, he had a very honest character while he lived there. I cannot answer for what has been since.

            . I live at Islington, and have known the Prisoner about nine or ten years. I am an apothecary, and have attended him and his family; he always paid me as an honest man. I never heard any ill of his character before this.

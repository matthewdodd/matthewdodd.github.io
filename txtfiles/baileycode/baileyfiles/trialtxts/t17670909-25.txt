, the prisoner lodged in the same house, one pair of stairs above me; I used to keep my chest locked, I missed my silver buckles out of my chest, and found it was not locked; I found them again at Mr. Morris's
Mr. Morris. I am a silversmith, by the New-Church in the Strand; on Saturday the 8th of August the prisoner came to my shop with an odd silver shoe buckle; she seemed to weep, and said her brother was in St. George's hospital, and had had a leg cut off that morning, and he would have occasion for no more than one buckle; I weighed it, and gave her eight shillings and nine pence for it; at night, about nine o'clock, or a little after, she came again, crying ready to break her heart, and said her brother was dead by the anguish of the operation, and then needed no buckles; I gave her the same price for that; I laid the pair in the window for sale, and the prosecutor came and owned them (produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I found one buckle going up stairs, and on the Tuesday coming down I found the other, and carried one to Mr. Morris's in the morning, and the other in the evening.

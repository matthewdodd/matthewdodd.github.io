JAMES FREDERICK MILES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of April, 18 ft. of iron chain, value 2s., the goods of 



George James Mason.






JAMES COULSON
. I keep a marine store shop on Saffron-hill. On the evening of the 25th of April I found the prisoner at my counter with this chain—he said his mistress had sent him to sell it—I said I would go with him to his mistress, which I did—she denied having sent him, but said the chain was hers—I took him to the station, and on the road he said his father told him to take it—I said he was a very bad boy, and I could not believe him—I took him to the station.





ELIZABETH MASON
. I am the wife of James Mason, who keeps cabs, in George-yard, Hatton-garden. The prisoner's father was in our service—the prisoner was about the place—this is our chain.





THOMAS PEARTON
. I am horse-keeper to the prosecutor. I married the prisoner's mother ten years ago—I never sent him to sell the chain—we were always on good terms, but I am sorry to say he is a bad boy—I sent him to school and to church—he has food as I have it.




GUILTY
.* Aged 10.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Parkhurst.

            . My husband keeps a lace shop
 in High Hoborn


. The prisoner came into our shop about seven o'clock in the evening, and laid hold of a lace veil in question, and asked the price of it; he bed me thirty shillings for it. He asked me to measure it; then he hung it up again, and went away; he came in about eight, and I saw him stretch himself at his full length, then he snatched the shawl, and ran off; I immediately gave the alarm, and he was stopped, and brought back; I am positive he was the man; the shawl has never been found. When he was searched in the shop, he pulled out a particular pocket handkerchief, with which he had blown his nose when he was in the shop before, and to the pattern of which I could swear.

. On the 15th of March I was opening the shop between seven and eight in the morning; the prisoner came, and when my back was turned, took a pair of shoes from off the shelf; I soon missed them; I went to an alehouse where he uses, and accused him with it; he confessed at once, and brought me them again, (produced and deposed to;) he is a cobler, he never dealt with my master.
Prisoner's defence.
I took them down to see if they would fit.

GOODMAN SOLOMON. I live in Field-lane, Holborn


, and sell clothes
. I employed a bricklayer, who brought the prisoner as a labourer
; he went away in the middle of the day, and I heard he was getting drunk. I then suspected that he had robbed me. I looked over my premises, and missed these things about twelve or one o'clock. I found him in a public-house, and found a ticket in his possession of the jacket - I then gave charge of him. I took him to the pawnbroker's, but he would hardly go in.

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner - he was very much intoxicated when I took him.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a jacket which was pawned for 3 s. by the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.

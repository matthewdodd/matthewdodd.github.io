            . I was walking along Newgate-street


; I missed my handkerchief; I observed the prisoner had just passed near me; I suspected him, and desired Mr. Eynon to pursue him, which he did, and as soon as Mr. Eynon had stopped him I saw him throw my handkerchief down, (produced and deposed to.)
Mr. Eynon confirmed this evidence.
"The prisoner said nothing in his defence."

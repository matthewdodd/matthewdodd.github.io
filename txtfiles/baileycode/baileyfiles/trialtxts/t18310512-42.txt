THOMAS CHAPMAN. I am a carter to Mr.

                  Hay
               



            , of Wickham-marsh, in Buckinghamshire. I drove his waggon, and on the 28th of April I fell in with the prisoner at Hillingdon, just on this side of Uxbridge - he was a stranger; he introduced himself to me, and asked if I was going to town, and what time I should get there - I said at seven o'clock in the morning; he then asked the turnpikeman if there was a coach going to town - he said there was not; he then called to me, and said he should overtake me on the road - before I got to Hillington he came up, and attempted to get into the waggon, but I would not let him; he then went on, and when I stopped he called for a pot of beer - I drank once out of it; there were several local soldiers, whom he seemed to know - we then went on again, and he wanted to ride; I said he might sit on the hay-band - he said he was so beat out that he should like to sleep; he got up into the waggon, with his feet hanging out, and appeared very drowsy - he then asked me to have some more beer or brandy, which I refused; I then got on near the night-house I called the prisoner out, and he came out with a bundle under his arm - I knew he had nothing before; he gave me two sixpences, and bade me good night - when he was gone off I got up into the waggon, and put my hand to feel for a box - it had been within one yard of the front on the near side, and I found it moved to the back and broken open - I ran, and caught the prisoner about two hundred yards from the place; he tried to get away as much as he could, and I told him he had broken open the box - he denied it; I said he should go back - I called the Policeman, and gave him into custody; he wanted to put his hand to his trousers - the officer would not allow him; I saw him take the parcel, containing this shirt and sovereign, from his trousers.
TIMOTHY LAWTON. I am a Police-constable. I saw the prisoner put his hand to his trousers - I said, "What are you about?" he said, "I have something here;" I said,"I will take that" - he gave me this shirt and sovereign; I found another sovereign in his pocket, some halfpence, and a key - he asked where they would send him; I said, "I don't know, perhaps let you go;" he said,"No, they will send me to the Old Bailey, and I shall see some of my palls there."

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I gave this box to the witness; it was corded with a new cord - it had this shirt in it, which I made for my son William Hay, who lives at Brighton - the sovereign was in it; it is the property of my eldest son,

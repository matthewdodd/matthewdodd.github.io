GEORGE TRIMLET. I am a shoemaker
, and live in Monmouth-street


. On the 25th of November I missed a pair of shoes from my place, which I had seen safe not a minute before; my wife pursued the prisoner for about ten houses, and took him; I had seen him before - he came with another lad to buy a pair of boots; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon when he took the shoes.

            . I did not see the shoes taken, but missed them, and went out; I took the prisoner by the arm, and brought him back - he had got about eight or nine houses off, and was turning into Monmouth-court; he had the shoes in his apron - he said he had just bought them; I swear they were my husband's, but the officer is not here with them.
Prisoner's Defence. Another boy asked me to go and buy a pair of boots; he gave me the shoes to go to White Lion-street, to wait there for him.

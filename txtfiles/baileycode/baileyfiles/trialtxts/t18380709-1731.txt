WILLIAM THORP
. On Sunday morning, the 8th of July, I was walking with two gentlemen—we went as far as Norfolk-street, in the Strand—I heard something, and missed my handkerchief—I saw Norman in charge of the officer.





JAMES HEWITT
 (police-constable F 50.) I was on duty about one o'clock last Sunday morning in the Strand—I saw the prosecutor and two gentlemen with him, and the two prisoners were behind them—I saw Wells take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket—he ran up the street with it—I could not perceive what he did with it—I caught him.

COURT
Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate more than you have told us? A. No.

COURT. Read what is on this deposition. Witness reads—"I was prisoners following the witness—when they came to the corner of Norfok-street, I saw the prisoner Wells put his hand into Mr. Thorp's coat pocket behind, and take from it a handkerchief and throw it away—the other prisoner was covering him."






ROBERT TAYLOR
 (police-constable F 87.) I was on duty at one o'clock the Strand, and saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor—I went the prosecutor and told him—he felt and said he had lost his handkerchief.—Wells ran away—Norman was covering Wells, and there was another behind whistling, who I have no doubt got the handkerchief.

Wells. He said at the station-house that I was covering Norman. Witness. No, I did not—when I went to the gentleman, before he well got his hand to his pocket Wells ran away—I had seen the prisoners cross from a court together and go to the gentlemen.

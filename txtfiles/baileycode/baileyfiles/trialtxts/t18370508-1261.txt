THOMAS WARNE
. I am a currier, and live in the Strand. The prisoner was in my employ for about six weeks as cutter—on the 26th of April, as he was going to dinner, I called him into the counting-house, having some suspicion, and said, "Andrews, you have some property about you belong ing to me, have you not?"—he admitted it, and produced one piece of leather from between his stocking and his leg—I said, "You have some more, "and he then produced another piece—I gave him into custody—he had no right to have the property about him—he had so much per thousand. for what he did—he was employed in cutting out convicts' shoes—I had a large contract for the government.





HENRY HANCOCK
. I am a policeman. I was sent for, and took the prisoner—he acknowledged that it was Mr. Warne's leather before we came out of the counting-house.




GUILTY
. Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

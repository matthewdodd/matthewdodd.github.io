            . I live in Harper-street, May-fair. I was in the Strand


 about ten o'clock, on the 28th of December; I felt my coat lifted up, I turned round, and missed my book; I laid hold of the prisoner; there were two men near him, I told him he had got it, the prisoner threw the book down, and my papers flew out; I saw no more of his companions. I let go of him topick my book up, and he ran away, but was stopped immediately; I am sure that he is the man.
JOHN COVERDALE. I am a solicitor's clerk. I was in the Strand, and saw the prisoner run across the street, and the pocket-book drop between the prisoner and prosecutor; I heard the cry of stop thief! he is the man that I saw run across the street; he was secured.
Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry and ran across.

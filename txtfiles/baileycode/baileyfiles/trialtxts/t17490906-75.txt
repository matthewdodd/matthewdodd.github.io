             in Rose-court, Fleet-lane


, we had two full pots of beer, we sent for it out of doors, and we all six agreed to go to bed together; I and this 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Taylor 
               



             went to bed, my fellow servant
s minds were alter'd, they went home and left me in bed; as soon as they were gone the other prisoner Maclane came within-side the room and lay down on one side of us, which might be about two o'clock. I went to sleep, and in the morning about four o'clock I awoke, and there was no body there but myself; I got up and pull'd all the bed-clothes off, and the bed likewise to see if I could find any of my things, there were my breeches, stockings, and shoes there; I miss'd my coat, waistcoat, watch, shoe-buckles, stock-buckle, and three silk handkerchiefs, which were in my coat pocket: I went home to Friday-street before many people were stirring, with what things they had left me. I put on some other cloaths the same day, and went in pursuit of them, and we found two of them in Fleet-lane, 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Taylor

                  Ellingham 
               



             ; I got a constable, and carry'd them to Wood street compter, and kept them till next morning, then took them before the sitting Alderman , they were both clear'd; the goal-keeper wanted their fees, but they had no money; the constable said to me, you had better pay their fees, and may be they'll tell you where your things are: accordingly I did, and they told me they would go and shew me where they had carry'd them, which they did; it was in Rag-fair; I went and ask'd the man if he had ever a coat and waistcoat that would fit me; he said no; said I, have you not got a coat and waistcoat you bought yesterday morning? no, said he, I have not; he brought the waistcoat to me, and I own'd it; he had cut the borrow off the coat and sent it to be scouer'd ; I would have given him six shillings for them, which was the money they said they sold them for, but he said he gave ten shillings, and he would not take less for them; so I left them there: while I was there Mr. Macdonald came and got a warrant for 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Taylor 
               



             and had her before Justice Gower , she there said 
               
                  Jenny 
                  Maclane 
               



             took my watch , shoe-buckles and stock-buckle, and put them in her bosom , and my coat and waistcoat she wrapped up in her apron, and said that she saw her sell them, and also the salesman said he bought them of 
               
                  Jane 
                  Maclane

             a Jew, to sell, and where he carry'd it, it was stop'd, so he made the best of his way back again.

            . Betwixt the hours of 11 and 12 at night on Wednesday 19.

                  Booth 
               



             and myself, took a walk out, when all our people were gone to bed, not thinking of meeting these persons, which we did; we met with the two prisoners in the Fleet-market, I was sober then as I am now; we went along with them into Fleet-lane, as before mentioned, Mrs. Ellingham's daughter was one in company. When we had drank up two full pots of beer, Tombs had agreed with 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Taylor 
               



            , to lie with her for one shilling; the other two women were desirous for us to give them each a shilling, so to make a round bed; I love a woman very well, but I chuse to have her to myself. I stay'd till almost 2 o'clock; I staid and saw Tombs and 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Taylor 
               



             in bed together, then I and Booth went away, and the other two girls call'd us scrubs &c. then they shut the door; I heard them fasten it as I was on the outside; I had beg'd of him before to go home with us, but he said, I like my girl, and I'll stay with her; I left him with the things mentioned in the indictment, and a guinea in gold in his pocket , and some silver; the money he brought home next morning; for they did not medale with his breeches; the next morning, I saw him come home without coat , waistcoat, or shoe buckles; he had tied his apron round his middle . I thought he look'd very destitute ; he went directly, and got into my bed, then I went up to him and said, James, it is hard times; a hard time indeed, said he, to lose my things; and likewise the key of the tap-house was lost; about 9 or 10 o'clock we went and took up Margaret Taylor and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Ellingham 
               



            , and carry'd them to the Counter, and the next morning they were acquitted; the keeper of the Counter wanted their fees; somebody said, come James, pay their fees, and may be they will tell you were your cloaths are, which he did. Then Margaret Taylor took him to Duke's-place, where she said the watch and buckles were left; the man's wife own'd, that she saw the things delivered to her husband; his name is 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Judah 
               



            : we saw none of the things; then we went to Rag-fair, by her directions; the rest as the former Witness.

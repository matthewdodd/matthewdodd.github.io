            . I am a horse-keeper
. On the 5th of May I slept at Mr. Battersey's, the Ship, in Long-acre


 - the prisoner was billeted there, and slept in the same room; my coat was in that room, and the half-crowns and handkerchiefs were in a box that was locked. I got up early in the morning of the 5th of May, and went out, leaving these things secure; when I returned at nine o'clock at night, the prisoner and the property were gone - he had been there six weeks or two months; I got my coat at Windsor about the 17th of August - the prisoner was there then; he is in the Grenadier Guards - the serjeant wrote to the landlord on the 13th of August, and I went down on the 17th; my box had been broken open.

            . I am a serjeant of the Grenadier Guards. The prisoner was a private in that regiment
 - he lodged at the Ship; he was absent about the time of the robbery - I reported him as a deserter; he was taken at Liverpool, and brought to Windsor in August - on his being brought in I found this coat on him, which I delivered to the prosecutor, in his presence; I had been pay-serjeant five years, and always considered him an honest, obedient, and good soldier - he has been seven years in his Majesty's service.

SARAH ANN COMBER
. I am in the service of Mr. James Bott, of Great George-street, New-road. He lost this beef, and butter, and cheese—it was safe at ten o'clock in the evening, on Thursday, the 21st of June—I know nothing of the prisoner—this is the beef and cheese—(looking at it,).






STEPHEN TAYLOR
 (police-constable S 90.) About six o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of June I was told a person was down the area of No. 72, Great George-street—I went, and saw no one—I called—no one answered—I then rang the bell, and the witness Comber came—I went into the area, and found the prisoner in the coal-cellar, with this beef and cheese tied up by the side of him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, and a drunken man threw my cap down the area—I went down, and this parcel was tied up there—I did not do it.

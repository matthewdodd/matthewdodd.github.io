 was indicted

ELLEN HUDSON
. I am the wife of John Hudson—we live in Church-court, Strand. On the evening of the 21st of September my little child Ellen Hudson was at my mother's house in Tottenham-court-road, where I was visiting—she had a necklace on—she came in from the door and complained of losing her necklace from her neck—I found it was gone from her person—a boy pointed out the prisoner to me—I took him and accused him of taking the necklace—he positively denied it, and I was obliged to give him in charge—I took him two streets off, brought him back to the door, and then he dropped the necklace at his feet—I took it up—this is it.





THOMAS CROSSMAN
 (police-constable E 27.) I was sent for and took the prisoner—he put his hand into his right band pocket, took out these beads, and threw them on the pavement.





GEORGE ANTHONY
. I saw the prisoner in Tottenham-court-road about a quarter before five o'clock on the day stated, with another boy—I saw the prisoner push the child up a door way—he had his hand on the child's neck, and stooped—he then ran off and I pursued.

Prisoners Defence. I was talking to the other boy, and he went and took the beads off the child's neck.




GUILTY
. Aged 12.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

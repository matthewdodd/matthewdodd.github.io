ALEXANDER DUNCAN
 was indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






JOHN WEBSTER
. I am in the employ of James Emlyn Carlisle, and others, wholesale haberdashers, Bow-lane. The prisoner came there on the 11th of July, and asked me for "half each of Marshall's best No. 35, black-mixed drab, and whitey brown"—he said he came for Bell and Leaf—I believed that to be the case, and gave him ten pounds of thread—he went away—I parted with it, supposing he came from Bell's house—he used to live there, and I thought he still lived with them.

Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect on what morning it was? Witness. On Tuesday—I did not say at Guildhall that I followed you—I went to look for you, but could not find you—I am certain you asked for it in the name of Bell, Leaf, or Bell, Leaf and Co.—I asked you for an order—you read it from your pocket—I knew you were in the employ of Bell and Leaf, but I asked your name, because it is a rule to ask the name of the person who has goods.





GEORGE BELL
. I am partner with Mr. Leaf—we are wholesale haberdashers. The prisoner was in our employ for some time, but quitted on the 1st of July—I did not authorise him to go for these threads—I never got the property.





CHARLES EATON
. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found the invoice of the thread on him—this is the book he read the order from.

Prisoner. I did not ask for the goods in the name of Bell and Leaf, nor did I get them under any false pretence.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20—


Transported for Seven Years.

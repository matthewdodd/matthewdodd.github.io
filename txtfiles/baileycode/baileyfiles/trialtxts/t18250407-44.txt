            . I stopped the prisoners by Tyburn-gate - I found five or six ducks in Brown's basket; and three or four in Pembrooke's; they were all dead - I produce the heads.
WILLIAM FULLER. These are the heads of the ducks I lost; I saw them before the heads were cut off; and I know them by marks - two drakes are here.

            ; they are partners and merchants

. I have done their business these seven years as a ship-broker. I missed some old iron out of a warehouse in Storehouse-yard


 about three weeks ago. I set 
               
                  James 
                  Lee 
               



             to watch yesterday fortnight; he can give a farther account.


                  James 
                  Lee 
               



            . I was set to watch the warehouse up one pair of stairs about nine in the morning. I saw Drury go down the wharf between two and three o'clock; there was one 
               
                  James 
                  Ashington 
               



             with him. I hid myself behind the door, which was fast. Ashington lifted Drury up to the window, who put his hand through the window and shoved a wooden bolt back, and by that means opened the door; he took up three iron bolts and threw them out at the door, and then came back for three more; a man was coming by who shut the door. After which he went to throw those three out, and I catched hold of him. Ashington threw three bolts under a piece of wood and ran away.
Drury's Defence.
He did not carry them out into the street; he put them under the logs.

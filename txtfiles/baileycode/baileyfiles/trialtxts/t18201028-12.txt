. On the 16th of September, I hung these trowsers at the door. In the afternoon a person came in and said we had lost a pair; I saw some men running down Lawrence-lane, they stopped at the bottom of the Church-yard, in a moment I saw a crowd, and found the prisoner in custody with them.

            . On the 16th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Cheapside, and saw the prisoner running on the other side of the way with a bundle under his arm, and a quantity of people following him calling Stop him! he turned down Ironmonger-lane into Church-passage, and was there stopped. I came up, and took the bundle from under his arm, and found the trowsers in it.

            . On the 14th of Sept. going up Crown court Fleetstreet


, I felt something twitch at my pocket, I immediately turned about, and saw my handkerchief was falling down betwixt the prisoner and I; he ran away, I pursued him, and called stop thief, upon which he was stopped near Serjeant's inn in Fleetstreet; he was never out of fight all the while.
Q. Did you see the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand?
Alsop. I did not. That part of it nearest the prisoner was falling to the ground. He ran away before I said any thing to him.
Q. Were there any other persons near you at the time?
Alsop. No, my lord, none but the prisoner.
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming from my work at St. James's market, and going to seek for more at Leadenhall, I saw the handkerchief lying; I ran to take it up, the gentleman turned about, I thought to strike at me, upon which I ran away, I was not got to it by 20 yards, or more.
Q. to prosecutor. How near was the prisoner to you when you saw the handkerchief falling ?
Prosecutor. He was within the length of the handkerchief, the prisoner offered to kneel down and beg pardon, and said it was another boy that went to pick my pocket.




               Guilty 10 d.

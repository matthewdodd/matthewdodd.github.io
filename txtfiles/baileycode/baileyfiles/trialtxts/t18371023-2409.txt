JAMES SMITH
. I live in George-place, Greenwich. On the afternoon of the 19th of October I was in Charlton-fair, between two and three o'clock, looking at a show—an officer came up and spoke to me—I put my hand to my coat, and missed my pocket-handkerchief—I told him so, and the prisoner was seized instantly and searched—a crowd gathered round, and a man produced the handkerchief to us—this is it—(looking at it.)





JAMES ADAMS
. I am Superintendent of the Lewisham and Lee police. I was at Charlton-fair on the 19th of October, and saw the prisoner standing close behind Mr. Smith—I saw him put his left hand into Mr. Smith's right-hand coat-pocket, and take a handkerchief out—then put it into his right hand, and attempt to shuffle it up his coat—I took hold him immediately—I tapped Mr. Smith on the shoulder, and asked if he had lost any thing—and while I was searching them prisoner the handkerchief was produced—I am positive the prisoner is the person who took it—Mr. Smith moved a little forward while he was taking it, and I saw the handkerchief—it was the same colour as the one produced.

Prisoners Defense. I was looking at one of the shows, and the policeman collared me—I had no knowledge of the handkerchief—he searched me, but found nothing on me—and when we moved about a hundred yards, a Person brought the handkerchief up, and asked if he had lost any thing.

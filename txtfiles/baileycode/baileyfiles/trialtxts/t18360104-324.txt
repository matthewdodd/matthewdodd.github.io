EDWARD WHEELER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of December, 2 half-crowns, 8 shilling, and 6 sixpences, the monies of 



Alfred Phillips, his master.






ALFRED PHILLIPS
. I am a print-colourer, and live in Newcastle-street, Clerkenwell-close. I had seen the prisoner two or three times in the company of my cousin—he applied to me, and said he was in distress;

and I gave him a day's work, on the 19th of December, in a two-pair of stairs room—he came next morning to finish the work—I had a waistcoat hanging by my bed-side in that room, and 16s. in the pocket—there were two half-crowns, eight shillings, and the rest in sixpences—I had felt it safe just before—I left him in the room for about two minutes; and on returning, I met him coming out of the room—he said he was going to fetch some water—he went down-stairs,—I put on my waistcoat, and missed the money—I came down stairs and found the pitcher at the bottom of the stairs, but he was gone—I found him about half-past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—he was searched at the station-house, and 9s. found on him—nobody but him could have taken it.





JOHN DAVIS
 I am a policeman. On the 20th of December. I went with the prosecutor and found the prisoner—I found on him four duplicates, one half-crown, and four shillings. and five sixpences—I took the money away from him—he said two shillings belonged to him—he was locked in the cell, and afterwards called to me, and asked who had his money—I said I had—he said, "I think it very heart; all the money I took from Phillips he owed me."





ALFRED PHILLIPS

re-examined. I did not own him any thing—I had paid him beforehand for the work which he had not finished, as he said he was very badly off.




GUILTY

Transported for seven years.

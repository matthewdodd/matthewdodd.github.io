            . I am a surgeon
, and live in Gloucester-place - the prisoner had lived with me as errand-boy
, and I took him again. On the 22nd of August, before I was up, he brought me a bill from Mr. Bell, a bootmaker, for 5l., and said Bell was waiting; I said it was not convenient to pay it - he said Bell would be satisfied with part payment, and I gave him two sovereigns; I came down in about an hour - the prisoner was then gone, and he had taken a suit of clothes, which weregiven him to wear in my house; he was taken next morning.
JOHN BELL. I am a bootmaker. Mr. Henderson owed me a bill; I never went for it, nor did the prisoner ever give me any money.

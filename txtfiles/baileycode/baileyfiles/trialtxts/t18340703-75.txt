             (police-constable H 158). I fell in with the prisoner, in Shoreditch, on the 7th of June - he was carrying two pair of shoes in a bundle - I asked him what he had - he said, "Nothing" - I found the shoes in it, and then he said another boy gave him them to carry - there was another boy with him, who went away - he was about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's.

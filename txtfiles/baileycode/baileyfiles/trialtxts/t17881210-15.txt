             sworn.
I was recommended to a lodging at the Pilgrim, in Holborn; between ten and eleven on Wednesday night, the 10th of December, the prisoner was there, and asked me to go home with her; and I went; and she said you have got no money; says I, I have got a little silver, and an odd half guinea never was spend yet; pulling it out of my waistcoat pocket, and holding it in her hand, says she it is a bad one, let me see it; and she took it out from between my fingers, and struck it on the table, and it rebounded, and she caught it up, and clenched it in her hand; I immediately said, you will hand me that back, if you please; says she, hand me what back; says I, my half guinea; she utterly denied ever seeing it; I caught hold of her hand, which was clenched, and in burst three women; they said, you are not going to hurt the girl; she pretended to strip, but sherun away; she was taken, but nothing was found on her; whether it went into her cuff, or whether she swallowed it I cannot say.
Prisoner. I know nothing of the half guinea.

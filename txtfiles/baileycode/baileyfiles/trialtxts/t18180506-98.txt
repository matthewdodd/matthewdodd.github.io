            . I am shopman to Mr. 
               
                  Ambrose 
                  Mathias Peck
               



            , tea-dealer
, in the Strand


. On the 10th of April, in the morning, I observed 24oz. of tea concealed in a lumber-room below stairs-it was in a handkerchief, which I knew to be the prisoner's; he was our porter
. I informed Mr. Peck - We sent him out in order to examine it. I ran down, and found it had been removed - He went down stairs before he went out; I called him back. Mr. Peck charged him with stealing tea - He denied any knowledge of it. We sent for a constable, who searched, and found it in the same room, but in a different place to where I at first found it-it was in a basket, which hung up. I am certain no person but him had been down stairs; nobody could have removed it but him.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I never quarrelled with the prisoner - I suspected him.

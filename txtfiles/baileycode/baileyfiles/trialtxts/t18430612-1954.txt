ELIZABETH WELLS
. I am a widow, and am a calico-glazer—I live in William-street, Curtain-road. On the 17th of May the prisoner came as my errand-boy—I had no character with him—I sent him with nine yards of calico and these other things to the Cross Keys, St. John-street—he was to book them—he came back in a short time, and went away, and did not return—I have not heard anything about the things—they were to have gone to Mr. Stracey, a dyer and scourer, at St. Alban's—the prisoner did not give any notice about his leaving.





WILLIAM HAWKINS
. I am a book-keeper at the Cross Keys, St. John-street. On the 17th of May the prisoner did not come there—he did not bring any parcel for Mr. Stracey—I am quite sure of it.





THOMAS FOWLER
 (City police-constable, No. 138.) I took the prisoner at

the bottom of Golden-lane—at the station he said he carried the bundle to the booking-office, and gave it to a man in the yard, or the gateway, that the man pulled a book out of his pocket, and marked it with a pencil.

Prisoner's Defence. I did so, and the man asked if I had a book or a bit of paper, that he might write upon it; I said no; he said it couldl not go before half-an-hour; I gave him 2d. to book it.





THOMAS HARRINGTON
 (police-constable G 204.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

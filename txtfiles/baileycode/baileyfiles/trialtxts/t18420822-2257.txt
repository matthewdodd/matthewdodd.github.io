WILLIAM ASHTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of June, 2 fishing-nets, value 3l., the goods of 



Josiah Wilson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ROBERT WARD
. I am in the service of Josiah Wilson, Esq., of Stamford-hill—about the 21st of June, I missed two fishing nets of his—I believe these, now produced, to be them.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. When did you see them last? A. On the 20th of June, in the summer-house adjoining the garden—there are only the servants and the labourers at Mr. Wilson's—I can swear to this net, and have used it in the New River several times—I have no mark upon it.





WILLIAM BARNETT
. I am a pawnbroker—I have produced the net—I cannot tell who pawned it—this is the duplicate I gave for it.





CHRISTOPHER NORTH
 (police-constable N 17.) I took the prisoner on the 9th of July, and found on him the duplicate of this net—this is it.





JOSEPH FOSTER
. I am a constable of Tottenham—I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

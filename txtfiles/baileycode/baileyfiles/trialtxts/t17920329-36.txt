             sworn.
On the 23d of March I lost four dozen of quart bottles, they were brought up into a back court behind my house to be washed; I heard nothing of their being taken till the prisoners were in custody in the counter; I saw them at Guildhall on Saturday the 24th; I cannot swear to the bottles.

             sworn.
On Friday night last I saw the two prisoners going up the passage with a hamper of bottles. I live at Mr. Blades's, on Ludgate-hill. Mr. Barley has a place in the passage where he washes his bottles; the prisoners had a hamper of bottles; I called to them, and they set them down immediately; they took them up and went across the way; I followed them, and a constable stopped them, and took them to the Compter; and some other person took the bottles.
Barley. There was no thoroughfare through the passage.

On Friday night, the 23d of March, I met the two prisoners: one said they were glass bottles, and the other said nothing.

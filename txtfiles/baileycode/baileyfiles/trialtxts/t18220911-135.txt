HENRY BUCKLER. I am short-hand writer. I remember the defendant being examined on the trial of 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Burke
               



            , for bigamy, in this court. I saw him sworn, and took down his evidence. In the course of his examination, the following questions were put. (Reads.)
"Q. While you were there," (meaning at the house of 
               
                  James 
                  Butler
               



            , at Cashel in Ireland,)
"did you ever see any ceremony of marriage performed by any body - A. None whatever." After some farther examination, he was asked,
"Q. I give you notice, that you will be contradicted if you deny this; but on the oath you have taken, did you not give your brother away - A. I did not. Q. Neither on the 11th or 12th" (meaning 11th or 12th of June 1815) -
"A. I did not. Q. Did you not give your brother away in marriage, either on the 11th or 12th, to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Butler
               



             - A. Never, since the day of his birth. Q. In all the time you were in Butler's house, did you see any marriage ceremony going on whatever - A. No."


                  JULIA 
                  BUTLER
               



            . I am the daughter of 
               
                  James 
                  Butler
               



            , who lived in 1818 at Cashel in Ireland. I had a sister named Mary; she was married at my father's house, in the summer of 1815, to 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Burke
               



            , the prisoner's brother; he was tried here for bigamy. The prisoner was present at the marriage; he gave his brother away at my father's house, in marriage to my sister, at Cashel. They were married by a Catholic priest; my sister is a Catholic.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you came to this country - A. I came last May. I believe I am about nineteen years old; my birth-day is some time in 
               August. My
             parents tell me that is about my age.
Q. The marriage took place in 1815 - you were then about twelve years old - A. Twelve, or upwards. The marriage was in June, in the afternoon, after dinner, about dusk - we generally dine about five. I do not think the priest dined there - he lived in the same street. I generally go to bed about ten o'clock. There was no feast, only our own family were present. There was a party next night, my sister Eliza and Mrs. Conden were present - she is rather older than 
               Eliza.
             I cannot mention every body who was present; my father was there - he is dead; my two sisters; my brother-in-law O'Carney - he is dead; and there was Mrs. Stapleton, a cousin of mine.
Q. Why could you not as well have told us at first that your cousin Stapleton was present - A. I did not recollect it. I have not given the subject much consideration, except that I want to get home; it is with the greatest reluctance that I appear here.
Q. What claim have you and your sister put in for your expences on this and the last trial - is it not upwards of 300 l. - A. I believe it is, travelling expences, the voyage, loss of time, and all; I have been detained here since May; I mind my mother's business at home; she is in the wine and spirit trade, and deals in hides; we also retail spirits. The most respectable houses in Ireland sell retail. We were not in the public line at the time of the marriage. There was wine and punch drank. I went to bed, and the marriage was much more than an hour before that. 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Burke
               



             used to go to mass after the marriage - I did not know him above a week or ten days before. My sister had been to Dublin, and whether she was acquainted with him there I do not know. Mrs. Stapleton was not asked to come over here; I believe her age was about twenty at the time; she lives at Tipperary. I did not dine at the table - I might run in and out at dinner time. I do not think the priest dined there.
Q. Do you expect any remuneration for what you have done here? - A. I expect the amount of my bill.
MR. ALLEY. Q. The second wife's father agreed to pay the expences of you and your sister's coming here - A. Yes; we do not expect to be paid for giving evidence. My mother constantly keeps one man servant, and sometimes has five or ten employed in the gardens. I was in and out of the room at the time of the marriage; and what has happened since it took place I cannot say.
Q. All you can recollect is, that you were present when your sister was married, and that the prisoner gave his brother away - A. Yes.


                  EMMA 
                  BUTLER
               



            . I am sister to the last witness, and am now about twenty-three years old. I was present at my father's house at Cashel, when 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Burke
               



             married my sister - it was in June, 1815; the Reverend Dr. Wright, the Catholic priest, married them; the prisoner was present, and gave his brother away in marriage to my sister Mary, - I am positive of it.
COURT. Q. Where did your sister go to live afterwards - A. At Dublin; they lived together till they had two children; I saw the prisoner frequently afterwards.
Cross-examined. Q. Who was present at the marriage - A. My father and brother-in-law (Michael O'Carney), the servants, my three sisters, and I believe my mother, my two cousins (Ryan and Stapelton), and I believe 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Ryan
               



            ; I cannot exactly say whether it was Catherine, but there was another person named Ryan; she was twelve or thirteen years old; my sister Conden was present; she is older than I; she does not live with my mother. I do not think the marriage took place so late as seven o'clock. I knew for a week previous that it was to take place. 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Burke
               



             had been at our house for about a week - he came from Dublin for the purpose of being married. I expect my expences for coming here; I do not know how much - my loss of time has been very great. I believe our expences are 300 l. or 350 l.
Q. Who sent to Ireland to bring you over - A. Letters brought us over; we were not subpoenaed, but understood we should be if we did not come - our business has been at a great loss, no person being able to take care of it, my mother being old. The priest did not dine there. 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Burke
               



             and my father sent for him. I believe I sat up till two o'clock - I don't know when Julia went to bed. There was not much drinking. Tobias and the prisoner, my father and O'Carney, sat up till four o'clock - they did not drink enough to make them drunk - I believe they were all sober on going to bed; they had wine and whiskey. I never saw Tobias at mass before the wedding, but have many times since. I believe our loss, through our coming here, will be more than 300 l.
MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you examined on the last trial - A. Yes; and alter that was subpoenaed to come here; I am very anxious to get my expences, to get away; I have made frequent application to go, nothing but the subpoena has kept me here. I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave his brother away.
COURT. Q. How long did Burke live with your sister,after the marriage, in Cashel - A. They stopped at our house nine or ten days; Dr. Wright and O'Carney are dead.
MR. PHILLIPS addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoner.

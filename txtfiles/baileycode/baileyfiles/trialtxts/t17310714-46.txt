             depos'd, That the Prisoner had been her Servant
 about 4 Years since, and missing Money out of her Drawer from time to time, and admiring how it should be gone, she always keeping it under Lock and Key, and the Key in her Pocket, she at last resolv'd to try an Experiment to find out the Thief, by marking 21 s. and 6 d. with a Cross on the Curl of the Hair on the Head side; that having done so before Witness, she lock'd it up as before, and 3 or 4 Days after looking into the Drawer miss'd 2 s. and 6 d. of it; whereupon to try the Prisoner, she goes to a Neighbour, desires her to go to her House, and ask for her, and say, that she wanted to borrow 1 s. and 6 d. which she her self not being at home, she was to desire the Prisoner to lend her, which her Neighbour doing, and the 1 s. and 6 d. which the Prisoner lent, was part of this mark'd Money.

             depos'd, That she did borrow 1 s. and 6 d. of the Prisoner, at the Desire of Mrs. Bradley, and it prov'd to be the mark'd Money; which the Prosecutor produc'd in Court, and Swore to be part of her Husband's which had been mark'd as before.
There were other Evidences to confirm this, and that the Prisoner did own the Fact, and the taking a Guinea at another time; and the Fact being fully proved, the Jury found her 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

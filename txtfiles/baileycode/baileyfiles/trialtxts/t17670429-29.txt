. Last Monday in the evening, about eight o'clock, I lost two pieces of white jeans; it is called sustain; it is used for the linings of waistcoats and breeches; the prisoner was taken by my servant with them, he can give a farther account.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; I heard something fall in the back warehouse; I went directly out, and saw the prisoner with two pieces of white jeans under his arm, my master's property; he flung them down and ran; I went and took him directly, in half a quarter of a minute. (Produced and deposed to.)

I am a sailor
; I was very much in liquor. I was walking by, and a butcher's boy saw a man run past and drop the things, just before they took hold of me.

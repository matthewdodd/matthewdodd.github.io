            , of Christ Church


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Silver Buckle set with Diamonds, in the Dwelling-House

            , the 11th of May
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prisoner was Servant
 to the Prosecutor at the Time of her taking the Buckle, but being sent out of an Errand did not return that Night, that her Mistress fearing some harm had befallen her, and not missing the Buckle at that time, sent to enquire after her, and was inform'd she was in New-Prison , she having been sent thither upon her being apprehended by a Goldsmith, in offering some of the Diamond Sparks to Sale, and giving him a false Account with whom she liv'd; the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value 39 s.

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of April
, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming up Bedford-street, Covent-garden, with another man; he had a basket on his head; I followed them; one went through the market, and the other through the Piazza; I followed the prisoner up James-street, into Great Queen-street, and just as he crossed Wild-street, his companion came up and whistled, and called out Jem; and immediately ran into Drury-lane, the prisoner looked round, did not see me, and went on with the basket on his head; I laid hold of him in King-street, and asked what he had in it; he said nothing; I said, I must see; I pushed him into a public-house, he threw it down, and caught hold of one end of a crow-bar, which was in it, I had the other end, it is a very powerful one, and would open any door in London, it is on an improvedprinciple, and has an extra purchase, I found a small screw driver in the basket, two sacks, and some green baize; he said, if they were mine, I might have them - that he had found them; I asked where, he said, in Piccadilly, and was going to Newgate-market; I said, that was not the right way.

Prisoner's Defence. I live at Chelsea; I was going to market, and between St. James's-church and the Haymarket, I found the crow and things, and put them in my basket; I was taken in Holborn; it is a conspiracy against me.

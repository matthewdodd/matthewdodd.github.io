PRISONER's DEFENCE.
On Wednesday night I went to bed about eleven; I heard a noise in the house; I went up to call my master; I called him twice, but he did not answer; I then went to the room where the two young gentlemen lay, and it appeared to me as if somebody was standing against the door on the inside, and I could not get in; I was then in my shirt; I came down and put these things on; and I found the street door open; and went out; and saw a man in the street, with a bundle under his arm; I pursued him across Smithfield, and there I lost him.




               GUILTY, 39 s.
            

Court to Prisoner. You have been sufficiently fortunate in this instance, that of the breaking out of the house, there is not sufficient evidence to affect your life, and to prove that part of the charge that is capital; for if there had, it is very probable that your Sovereign, however gracious his inclinations are, would not have thought you a very proper subject of mercy; for the fact of a servant getting up in the night, and robbing his master's house is so extremely dangerous to every family, and to the peace and good order of society; that no punishment that the law can inflict can be too severe in this: it is my duty, and the duty of the Court to prevent you from the possibility of doing future mischief, and to sentence you
For 


               transportation to Africa for seven years
            .
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

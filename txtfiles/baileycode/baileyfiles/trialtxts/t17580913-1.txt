            . I am a publican
, I lost a silver tankard the 18th of last month; we had a suspicion of her, she being in my house about that time; we took her up with a warrant, and before the justice she confess'd she took it out of my house; and as we were going to the Watch-house, she carried us to the place where she carried it; we were there three or four hours; she said she left it there for a trifle of money, but the woman of the house has not been there since. I have not got the tankard.
Q. What was her name?
King. Margaret or 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cuddy 
               



            ; the house is on Salt-petre-bank.

            . I was the constable that took the prisoner up, by Mr. King's order. I searched the house where she lodg'd in Worcester-street, Old-Gravel-lane; we took her before justice Scott, she would not own any thing there, but afterwards going to the Watch-house, she owned to the taking it. She said she would bring us to the house where she had left it, for a small trifle of money. We went to that house, but could not find the woman of the house; the back door was open, and the print of a woman's feet going out at it.
The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.

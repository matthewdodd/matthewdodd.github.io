, the 9th of December
 last. It appear'd by the Evidence, That as Mrs. Bentley was sitting in a Parlour, the Prisoner came into the Shop, and took the Goods off from a Shelf, and Mrs. Bentley going into the Shop to her, she pretended to want to buy Linnen Cloth, which she did not deal in; and taxing her with having taken the Goods, the Bundle dropp'd out of her Petticoat. The Prisoner pleaded, It was only a Mistake; that she had such a Bundle, which she laid down on a Table in the Prosecutor's Shop, and took up that Bundle of Stockings, thinking it had been her own. But this not being credited by the Jury, they found her 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d

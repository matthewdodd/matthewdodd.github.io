WILLIAM ASH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of September, 1 till, value 1s. 6d. 1 groat, 2 pence, 24 halfpence, and 5 farthings, the property of 



Edward Stanford.






SARAH CHAMBERS
. Edward Stanford is a painter, and keeps a fruiterer's shop at Newington. On the 21st of September I saw the prisoner, whom I did not know before, lying across the counter with the till in his hand—he got down off the counter and put the till on the counter—he then went out of doors and went away—I looked out for a policeman—I saw one, and the prisoner was taken—he had not taken any thing out of the till—I was too quick upon him—there was a groat, 2 pence, 24 halfpence, and 5 farthings in it—I am sure he is the same person.





JAMES FIELD
 (police-constable 108 N.) I took the prisoner and charged him with what he had done—I asked him whether he was the boy that went in the shop—he said he had done nothing.

Prisoner. Q. Was any one with me? A. Yes, Charles Glossop—I took both together—I had not seen the prisoner before.




GUILTY

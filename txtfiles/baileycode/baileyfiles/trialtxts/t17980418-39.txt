             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a clerk in the East-India House; I have known the prisoner five years, he was there as an extra clerk
 in the secretary's department, where the books of correspondence of the East-India Company are kept, there were presses on purpose for them: On the 28th of February, I think Wednesday, I had occasion to go to the shop of Mr. Hales, after some ham, he keeps a ham-shop in Fenchurch-street; while Mr. Hales was cutting the ham, I saw some paper which laid on some ham; as soon as I put my eyes on it, I saw that they were Bombay papers, and had the appearance of part of the records belonging to the Company; I asked him to give me a sheet of that paper, which he did; I went to the India-house immediately, and enquired if there had been any books lost; upon search, it was discovered that there had been a part of the records of the Company lost; upon that, I was ordered to take Mr. Wall, and go to Mr. Hales's house, which we did, and there we discovered these papers which I have in my hand; Hales delivered them up. (Produces them).
Q. Are they papers belonging to the India Company? - A. Yes; they are part of the Company's records that have been lost from the India-house.
Q. You have no doubt that these were the papers that had been missed from the India-house? - A. I am fully convinced that they belonged to the India Company's records.
Q. Did you then go back to the India-house? - A. I was then ordered to go to Mr. Hales's, and desire he would come up to the House; Mr. Hales did come up; I was ordered to get a constable, which I did; when Mr. Hales came, he indentified the prisoner as being the person of whom he had bought the papers; he was taken into custody, and committed to the Poultry Compter that night.
Q. Did he say any thing at the time he was taken up? - A. I was not in the India-house at the time.

             sworn. - I have kept a hamshop many years, No. 117, Fenchurch-street: I remember buying, about the 25th of January, of the prisoner, about three pounds of paper, which he brought under his arm; I put it in the scale, it weighed three pounds, and I paid him nine-pence for it.
Q. Did you buy of him more than once? - A. Yes; for these three or four years, at different times, or upwards.
Q.(To Hillman.) These papers that you have produced in Court, from whom did you receive them? - A. From Mr. Hales; I have had them ever since.
Q.(To Hales.) Look at these papers, and tell me if they are the same papers? - A. I believe they are; I did not take particular notice of them.
Court. Q.You buy a great deal of paper, I dare say? - A. Yes; almost every day.
Court. Q. And can you, buying a great deal of paper, say that you bought that paper of that man? - A. Yes; I can.

Mr. Knapp. Q.What did he say when you went to the India-house? - A. He sainted away as soon as he saw me; he at first denied it, and said he had not sold me any paper a long time; I told him I had bought it of him only four or five days before.


                  MATTHEW

Q. Did any conversation take place upon that? - A.Not a syllable.
Court. Q.How were these papers kept, under lock and key? - A.No.

Prisoner's defence. First, my Lord, I would recommend myself to you and a merciful Jury; and, in the next place, would recommend myself by six small children to the mercy of the whole Court, and plead not guilty in the cause in which I now stand. First, I have received of this said Matthew Wall, at several different times, by purchase and by gift; and in all probability the same that is laid before the Gentlemen of the Jury and the Counsel; and with respect to the covers of the books, Mr. Wall might bring one hundred to criminate me, as the nature of the business is to have the books cut up, delivered out in sections, and put into forty or fifty different hands, and the covers go to Mr. Wall, by way of emolument, to sell or give away, as seemoth to him best. I have stood unimpeached for eighteen years in the Company's service, and give me leave to say, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is done more out of spite than any thing else; and not only that, the place where I was situated to write, from whence I am charged with feloniously stealing and taking away books, is in as public a place as the Royal Exchange, where there are all comers and goers passing and repassing from six in the morning to nine at night, where hundreds of papers and books are lying, and have been lying about the floor for several years; books of the same kind, that every body can look at as they pass by, and take away as they please; and, because I am a poor unfortunate man, it is laid to my charge. In the public office, they are lying bound and unbound; and not only that, there are men that have keys to the office, that go into the office before any of the clerks come in the morning; and besides, the said Matthew Wall has got a key to go in and out when he pleases; and there are several that are under him.
Prisoner. (To Wall.) Q. Can you swear, in the sight of God, that I took these papers and books? - A. No.
Prisoner. Q. Do not you recollect, about three months ago, you had like to have brought me into the same disagreeable situation, by selling or giving away some papers or books? - A.There never were any books given away or sold.
Court. Q. Did you ever sell or give away, or is it the custom of the office to have the backs of books torn off? - A.Outside papers, but never any books or records that come from India.
Prisoner. Q.Do not you know Norton-Falgate? - A. Yes.
Q. Don't you recollect the tripe-shop there? - A. Yes.
Q. Do you recollect Mr. William Thompson bringing news to the house of some written papers, when I had like to have been in this disagreeable situation before, when you yourself confessed you had sold and given them away? - A. I never said such a thing in my life.
Court. Q. Have you ever had any dispute or animosity of any kind with the prisoner? - A. Never; on the contrary, I have given him several half-guineas.

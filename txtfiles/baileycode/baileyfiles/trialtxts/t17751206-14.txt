               stealing in the dwelling-house of Sir 
                     
                        George
                         Young
                     



                  , Baronet, in the parish of St. Mary le Bone, a paper machee snuff box, mounted in gold, and a silk sacque and petticoat, value 5 l.

            . I am butler to Sir


                     George
                      Young
                  



               
            .
Where does he live? - In the parish of Mary le Bon



.
Do you know of any thing being lost in his house? - I know no farther than that I saw Sir George and his lady at Mr. justice Welsh's office own the gown and snuff-box as their property. I have often seen the gown worn by my lady; the snuff-box was Sir George's; I don't know any thing of it: I am sure that gown which I saw at the office was the same my lady wore.
Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - I have seen him before.

            . I live as kitchen maid at Sir 
               
                  George
                   Young
               



            's; I know the silk sacque and petticoat to be my lady's. (The gown produced.) I am sure that is my lady's gown: I was left in care of the town-house; I cannot say as to the time when it was taken away, for I did not see it from the time my lady wore it, till I saw it at justice Welsh's office; I know nothing of the snuff-box.
Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - Yes; in August last I let him into the house twice to hang bells; I had other workmen in the house, and could not stay with him, as I had to answer at the door: the gown was in my lady's bed-chamber, and I knew nothing of its being missing until my lady came to town.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Holborn; this snuff-box I took in of 
               
                  Harrison
               


             the prisoner; I lent him a guinea and a half on that and several other things, which have since been delivered up to lady Young. The prisoner was better dressed then than now: I have known him these three years; he has pledged several things with me, but always took them out.

            . I know nothing of the robbery; I have had these things in my custody some time: the prisoner owned every thing, acknowledged that he took the gown and petticoat, with several other things, out of Sir 
               
                  George
                   Young
               



            's house.
Were there any promises made him before he confessed? - No; he was detected before he confessed: I said, as the case stands, if you will confess where the things are, I will speak to the judge and the gentlemen of the jury, and do what I could; but I did not promise that he should not be prosecuted.

            . About the 20th of October last the prisoner applied to me to buy this sacque and petticoat, but I did not know any thing of the snuff-box: he told me he had some goods at Mr. Preston's in Prince's-street, and some in Mr. Ward's in Holborn; I took them out of Ward's, and advanced money upon them: this is the very gown he brought to me; he offered it for three guineas, and I gave him seven guineas for it and several other things: he said that his sister was in keeping by an East India merchant, and that they were her property: I thought he had not come honestly by them, and told him I would give no more money until he brought his sister: he told me her name was 
               
                  Ann
                   Harrison
               



            , and that she lived at Richmond; I went to Richmond next morning and made enquiry, but could find no such person.
The prisoner made no defence; but said, he left it to the mercy of the jury.

            . Do you know any thing of the goods taken from Mr. Selby? - I locked them all up when I went out, and they were gone when I returned: several sacques the property of Miss Selby, a silk tabby coat and loose bodied sacque and coat of Mrs. Selby's; they are here, and I am sure that they are Mrs. Selby's property.
Are those the goods belonging to Mrs. Selby? - Yes; I know them very well: I am Mrs. Selby's maid.

            . I had these things from the prisoner; a pale silk and a clouded silk sacque I had from Harrison, which he pledged last August, and fetched out again the 20th October. I do not recollect what particular goods; but I gave him four guineas for the whole of what he left.

BENJAMIN FRANCIS DALTON WILSON
. I am a captain in the Army. I was in Pall-mall about a quarter past two o'clock in the afternoon—my purse was in my coat-pocket—I felt a slight touch at my pocket, turned round immediately, and saw the purse in the prisoner's hand—I collared him, and took it from him, and gave him to a policeman who came up—it contained four £5 notes, four sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and 6s.—I can swear to the notes.





JAMES DUPERE
. I am an officer. I took him into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Pall-mall, about two yards behind the gentleman—a lad, about a yard and a half before me, made a start, and threw the purse down—I picked it up, and the gentleman charged me with stealing it.

MR. WILSON. The prisoner was close upon me, almost treading on my heels—there was another with him who ran off.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

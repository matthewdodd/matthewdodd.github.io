 was indicted

 for feloniously forging and uttering a certain request for the delivery of two or three boas, with intent to defraud 



John Augustus Nicholay.


MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.





MARGARET HAY
. I am in the employ of John Augustus Nicholay, a furrier, in Oxford-street. On the 15th of January the prisoner came and presented this letter to me—knowing Mr. Moore, whose signature is to it, I gave the prisoner three boas—I saw Mr. Moore about three weeks afterwards, and mentioned the circumstance to him.





GEORGE BINFIELD MOORE
. I am the prisoner's uncle. I believe this letter to be his hand-writing—it is not mine, nor any part of it—I never authorised him to write it or to utter it—I had dealings with Mr. Nicholay—in consequennce of what Margaret Hay said to me I had the prisoner apprehended—(letter read)—"To Mr. Nicholay, 82, Oxford-street, January 15, 1838.—Sir, have the kindness to send by the bearer two or three squirrel boas for Mrs. Moore to make choice of. I shall be in town again to-morrow, and will call on you—he kind enough to ticket the price on them. Yours, faithfully, George Moore, Uxbridge."





HENRY WILLIAMS
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody on the 14th of this month—I found him in a common brothel—I asked him if his name was Moore—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had an uncle living at Uxbridge—he said he bad—I told him I took him for stealing some boas from a shop in Oxford-street—he said, "I thought that was it"—I found a letter on him containing a list of articles.

Prisoner's Defence. I have been led on by other parties whom I have got acquainted with—I am sorry for what I have done—I wrote to my uncle, wishing him to let me come home, and they trapped me—I did not expect to be taken away—my uncle has been very hard against me.

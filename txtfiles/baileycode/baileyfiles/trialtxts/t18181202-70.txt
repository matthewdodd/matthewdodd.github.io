            . I am a patrol. On the 19th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was at the end of Watling-street


, a cart was passing loaded with rags. I saw the prisoner and two men there; I concealed myself to watch - two of them were taking the rags out of a hole in the bag, and putting them into the prisoner's apron; I went up to them, one saw me, and ran away with the other. The prisoner went into Size-lane - I took him there, folding the rags up. I never lost sight of him. I cannot find out who the cart belonged to.
Prisoner's Defence. I found them by the waterside.

Lazarus Barnard. I am a Polish Jew. I hired the prisoner as a porter
, to carry these things, with others, in a bundle, to a warehouse, and paid him; and when I came to look over my goods, these were missing. He carried them from Wapping to St. James's, Duke's Place. When I came to make my complaint to my countrymen, and another man, they told me they had seen the prisoner with these same goods; four pieces of cut velvet, and six pieces of stuff for a gown. I sent my countryman, 
               
                  Levi 
                  Joseph 
               



            , to whom the prisoner had offered them to sale, as he told me, to buy them again of the prisoner.

            . I was at the vestry, and heard Lazarus Barnard's complaint. I said the prisoner had offered them to me to sell: he sent me to buy them: I went and bought them of the prisoner at the bar. (Produced and deposed to.)

            . I live in Bath-street, City-road


. I am a shoemaker
. I lost the boots on Thursday, the 10th of this month. I was at work in the shop until half past eight. I went into the back parlour to have my supper, and about nine I heard a noise at the shop window. I immediately pursued it. He ran off. I took him, and brought him in doors. One of my children found the boots at the door. These are boots. They are mine.
Q. What had he done with the boots - A. He flung them away, because I pursued him close. They were picked up by the children, and given to me. I am sure the prisoner is the man.

            . I am an officer. As I was taking the prisoner to the watchhouse to lock him up, he said, it is dirty work; they may transport me, and do what they like.

 Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman asked me what I had got about me. I said, nothing I went in immediately. He searched me, and found nothing.

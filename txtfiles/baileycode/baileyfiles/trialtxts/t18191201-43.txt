            , who is a coal-merchant
 - I keep a ready-made linen warehouse in Newgate-street


. On the 7th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some handkerchiefs which laid in the window. I handed them to him, he took them in his hand to look at them, said they were too dear, and wished for some at a lower price. I turned round to a glass case behind me, to reach some, he opened the street-door, and ran out with the handkerchiefs. I called the servant down, ran after him, and told a man to stop him - he was stopped. He dropped two handkerchiefs, and two others were found on him.

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running, I followed and overtook him. I took two handkerchiefs out of his hand.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office that you took them out of my bosom - A. No; his hand was against his bosom.

Prisoner's Defence. Your Lordship is aware of the unfortunate circumstances in which I was placed before this. I had made every endeavour to obtain employment, but it was ineffectual.

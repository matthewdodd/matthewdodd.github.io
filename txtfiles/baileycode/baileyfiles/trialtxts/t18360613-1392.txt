1392. 




GEORGE BARRON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Edward Norton, from his person.






EDWARD NORTON
. On the 17th of May I was in the Strand, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I had passed the Adelphi theatre—I felt a tug at my coat pocket, turned round, and seized the prisoner, with my handkerchief in his hand—he gave it to me, and begged for money—I collared him, till I found a policeman—I met Palmer on my way to the station-house, and gave him into his custody there.

Prisoner. Yesterday, when another man was brought to the bar, he swore he was the man, and now he swears to me. Witness. The prisoner was quite differently dressed yesterday, he had no smock-frock on—I made a mistake yesterday, when I saw another man at the bar, but the man that took my handkerchief I gave into custody—he begged for mercy, and said, "You may do whatever you like with me, but don't give me into custody."

Prisoner. Another young man was with me—he said he would go towards home with me, and going by the Adelphi he turned round and said, "Here, take this," and gave me the handkerchief—the gentleman turned round, and said, "You have got my handkerchief," and the other run away. Witness. I saw nobody run away—there was a boy on his right,

who I suspected, and I said I considered him an accomplice—the prisoner acknowledged at the station-house that he had taken the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





GEORGE PALMER
 (police-constable F 125.) The prisoner is the man who was given into my custody at the station-house by the prosecutor—I met them in the Strand, and accompanied them to the station-house—I am certain the prisoner is the man.

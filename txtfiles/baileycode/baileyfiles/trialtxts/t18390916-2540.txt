MICHAEL HAYES
. I am a labourer. I was at Mr. Stokes's, a publican, on the 12th of September—the prisoner came to his house about half-past one o'clock—she had half a pint of beer, and went out—in about half an hour she returned with another woman—they had more beer—the other woman drank part of it, and went away—the prisoner then sat down and drank some beer, then went into the back yard, came in again, sat down and drank the beer—she went out—I went to the door, and saw her crossing the road with the pint pot—I informed the publican, and she was taken.





WILLIAM STOKES
. I keep the Duke's-headin Great Peter-street The witness told me what he saw, and I gave the prisoner in charge—the policeman found four other pots of mine in her apron—he took her to the station-house, and found two keys in her pocket—he went to her lodging with her, and found in a cupboard six other pots, four of which are mine.

Prisoner. Q. Did you ever see me on your premises? A. Yes, and my wife has served you, and when you have gone the pot you have had has been missing.





JOHN JOSEPH MUNSER

On the 12th of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was called and took the prisoner—the prosecutor took one of the pots from under her apron—I found four more in her apron—I took her to the station-house, and found on her two keys, one of the front door, and onu of her room—I found there six other

pots, four of them were the prosecutor's, and two are new ones, they had come in the night previous.

Prisoner's Defence. The pots in my house were some I had—two of my children had died, and the neighbours brought the pots in, and I had some in my apron to take home.

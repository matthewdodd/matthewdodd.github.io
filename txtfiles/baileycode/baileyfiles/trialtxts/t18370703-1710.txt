JOHN SALMON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of July, 2 boots, value 8s., goods of 



William Graham.






WILLIAM GRAHAM
. I live at No. 2, Fisher-alley, Whitefriars, and am a boot-maker. At half-past ten o'clock on Saturday night, the 1st of July, the prisoner and another came to my shop—the other tried on some boots—I showed him several pairs, and then he said he would call on Monday morning, and leave his measure for a pair—he left, and the prisoner too—I did not miss a pair that night, but I did on Monday morning—these are them.

Prisoner. You said at the office that I did not come into the shop at all at what time did you see the boots? Witness. About ten o'clock—you stood at the door—I cannot say who took them.





GEORGE JOSEPH FORD
. I live at No. 1, No. 1, Field-lane. On Saturday night, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, the prisoner came and offered me these boots for sale for 4s.—I gave him in charge—there was another young man outside the shop—the prisoner and his pal almost killed my shopman in taking them to the watch-house, and the watchman was ill-used as well.

Prisoner. There was no person with me, and he swore before that he gave me in charge at half-past ten o'clock, and now he has altered the time—I paid for the boots.

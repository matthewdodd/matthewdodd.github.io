Transported for Seven Years.





EDWARD RICHARD PHILLIPS
. I am a solicitor, and live in Great Titchfield-street. This glass lamp hung in my hall on the 25th of October—I missed it next day.





JOHN FAULKNER
. I am a jeweller, and live opposite the prosecutor On the 25th of October, I saw the prisoner walking past his door, which was open, as it usually is—I then saw Beckett go in, and in a little while Gardner went in—they came out together, and went away—Beckett had this lamp under his arm—I went after them, and got a young man to assist me in taking them—I said they must both come back—I took Gardner—he resisted very much; and we were both down together—he said he knew nothing about it—he had stolen no lamp.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What Beckett had represented to him, you do not now? A. No.

FORTUNATUS-HEMMING. I was going along Charles-street, and assisted Mr. Faulkner—I took Beckett with the lamp.

Gardner's Defence. I was going to Paddington after a situation—I met Beckett, who asked me to be so kind as to unhook one end of this lamp to keep it, from breaking—he had it in his arm—he waited off, and I walked on the other side—the witness came and touched me on the shoulder, and said, "You are to take the lamp back"—I said, "What lamp?"—he said, "The one you stole"—I said I had not stolen it.

GARDNER—

 for stealing, on the 
11th of April, 2 sheets, value 3s.; 1 counterpane, value 4s.; and I can dlestick, value 6d.; the goods of 



Henry Vaughan.






HENRY VAUGHAN
. I live in Martha-street, St. George's. The prisoner was came to lodge at my house—she went away, and I broke the door open, and missed these articles—I went to the police-office, saw the prisoner there, and asked her how she came to do it—she said she was persuaded, and that she had pawned the things at two different places—a person went to those places, but the things were not there.





SARAH VAUGHAN
. I missed these things from the prisoner's bed—and the candlestick—the prisoner came back to me about a fortnight ago, and said she came to give herself up about the things—I said I did not know what to do, as my husband was not at home—she said she would come again at five o'clock, but she did not.

Prisoner. I offered to make her amends for them.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

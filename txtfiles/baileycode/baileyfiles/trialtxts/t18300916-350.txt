JOHN ANDERSON. I was in Crown-street


 on Saturday last between twelve and one o'clock - I was going home and saw a disturbance; I went with a friend to see what it was - I felt a tug at my pocket, turned, and missed my box; I saw the prisoner working his way through thecrowd, and calling to another person; I seized him, called the Policeman, and gave him in charge; the moment I did that I saw him throw something down an area - we took him to a public-house, and found my snuff-box in his left-hand coat pocket, and the next morning the private watchman found my friend's snuff-box down the area - there had been no snuff in mine; this is my box - it appeared to me the prisoner had some one with him; he called to some one.

 was indicted

JOSEPH SYMES
. I live with Robert Walkington and another, cheesemongers, High-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner came in with another person on the 12th of January—we saw something move in the window, and the clerk asked me if there were not some cushions of bacon in the window—I said, "Yes"—the prisoner went out of the shop—I missed this cushion of bacon as soon as she went out and I pursued—she had got about a hundred yards—I took her by the arm, and asked if she was not in the shop with another woman—she said she was, but that woman was nothing to her—she had no bacon—we let her go, and then the policeman came with this bacon, he went and stopped the prisoner.





JOSEPH CLEMENTS
. I am a policeman. A shopman gave me this bacon, and said there had been a woman stopped—I went to the shop and then took the prisoner—she said nothing then—but on taking her to the office next morning, she asked me what they would do with her—I said I did not know—she said "I did take it, I wish it had been better, and I hope they will send me out of the country; for if they don't I will keep on till they do."




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

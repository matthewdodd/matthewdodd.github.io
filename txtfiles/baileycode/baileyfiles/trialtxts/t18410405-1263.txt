1263. 




THOMAS DODD
 was indicted

 for feloniously receiving of a certain evil-disposed person, on the 
9th of March, 1 brush, value 1s.; the goods of 



William Metcher; well knowing the same to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.






WILLIAM METCHER
. I am a bricklayer, living in Ann-street, Waterloo-road. I lent a brush of mine to Garland—this now produced is it—I know it by the irregularity of the hairs, and the handle.





JOHN GARLENT
. I had this brush from the prosecutor—I took it to Norwood, where I was plastering—on Monday, the 8th of March, it was missing—I had left it safe on Saturday evening, the 6th, in the fire-place—the house was locked—the jamb was broken from the doorway.





WILLIAM COCKRILL
 (police-constable L 108.) I went to search the prisoner's premises on the 24th of March—I found this duplicate there, which led me to the pawnbroker's, where I found this brush—there were thirty-five duplicates belonging to the prisoner.

Prisoner. I purchased it of a person that came to my shop, where I sell carpenters' tools, and other things; I asked what he wanted for it, and he said, 1s.; I gave it him; and, wanting some money, I pawned it at Mr. Beck's, in Blackfriars'-road, for 6d. Witness. His uncle died a short time ago, and left him some tools, and he opened a little shop—I found this book there, in which there was nothing entered on the 9th of March, when this was pawned—I believe he has no license as a marine-store dealer.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

Before Mr. Recorder.

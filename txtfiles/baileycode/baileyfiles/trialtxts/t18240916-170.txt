            . I live in Shoreditch


, and am a hatmaker
 - this hat has my private mark upon it; it was hanging at my door at five o'clock on the 20th of August.

            . I am the wife of the last witness. At half past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw a little boy take the hat from the door. I went forward, and saw him run down Magpye-alley; and when he got to Blossom-street he threw it away. I saw another boy taken, but he was not the one who took it.

            . I am thirteen years old. On the night of the 20th of August, I was near Magpye-alley, and saw the two prisoners standing together; I saw Clarke give 
               Warren
             a kind of push, and then he went to Norton Falgate, to Mr. Mallet's shop, and snatched the hat: they both ran down Magpye-alley. I saw Clarke give 
               Warren
             the hat. Mr. Mallett came out, and Warren dropped the hat in Blossom-street. I have known the boys for some time.

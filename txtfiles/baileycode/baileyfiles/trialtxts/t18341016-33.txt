            . The prisoner was my errand-boy
 - I missed the articles stated, and on the day following I charged him with them - he denied all knowledge of them- I told him I would forgive him, if he would confess, but he would not - the sugar-tongs and the nut-crackers were afterwards found at Mr. Lowther's, the pawnbroker.

            . I saw the prisoner on the evening of 29th September - he came to our shop, and wished to know if these were silver - I asked whose they were - he said, his own, and he had just picked them up in the road - he left the shop, and came again in about an hour, and another boy with him, who said he saw the prisoner pick them up- I said I should detain them both, which I did.

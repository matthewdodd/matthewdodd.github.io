I live in Grafton-street


, the prisoner lived with me as porter
; on the 19th of August, having some reason to suspect him, I marked three shillings worth of halfpence, I told him to take care of the shop while I went into the yard; when I returned I missed nine halfpence; I sent for a constable, who searched him and took him to the watch-house; I was not in the yard three minutes, he was not entrusted to pay or receive, never bought or sold goods: I missed goods several times before.

I found these halfpence on the prisoner.

Prosecutor. Those halfpence that are here I marked twenty-four by the letter of the alphabet, and some by numbers, those which I found on the prisoner correspond with the nine missed.
The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.

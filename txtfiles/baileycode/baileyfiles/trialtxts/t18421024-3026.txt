HENRY WARD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of October, 17 feet of leaden pipe, value 5s., the goods of 



Thomas Smith; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD WATSON
. I am foreman to Thomas Smith, and live in Derby-road. I went to a building of his, and found a quantity of leaden pipe there—it was his, and was safe on the afternoon of Saturday, the 16th of October.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-constable N 69.) I was on duty in plain clothes, about half-past one o'clock in Beauvoir-square, near an unfinished house—I watched about half an hour, and saw the prisoner come down the stairs with this pipe in his arms, and two pieces I took from his pocket. EPHRAIM GRANT (police-constable S 144.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

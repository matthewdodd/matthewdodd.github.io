JOHN HODSON
. I am porter to Henry Robarts, a woollen-draper, in Conduit-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On the 27th of August, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the shop at the desk—I raised my head and saw a person go out of the shop with this black cloth, which laid six or seven paces from the door, under his arm—I ran to the door, and saw him walking with it on the pavement—I bolted the shop door, and ran out at the private door—I found him still going on with it under his arm—he crossed over by the coach stand, threw the cloth into a cab on the stand, and got in and sat down—I collared him, brought him out with the cloth, and gave him in charge—there is eighteen yards of it—It is worth 10l. I was a policeman at the time. I took the prisoner into custody with the cloth.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten years.

Before Mr. Justice Vaughan.

            . On Saturday the 7th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going from the city towards Salisbury-court in Fleet-street


, this boy at the bar came jostling against me, I immediately clapped my hand in my pocket and found my handkerchief was gone; I took him by the wrist and went into a hosier's shop facing Bridewell-lane; when I came to the light I perceived my handkerchief up his sleeve, I took it out (produced in court and deposed to) he said another boy threw it over his shoulder and ran away.
Q. Did you perceive any other boy near you?
B. Gray. No, I saw none but the prisoner.
Prisoner's defence.
Two boys got me to take a walk with them, one of them took that handkerchief and put it up my arm and ran away.

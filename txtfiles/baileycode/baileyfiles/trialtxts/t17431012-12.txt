                  Ann 
                  Dawson 
               



            . On Friday the 23d of September. I went out; and when I came Home, about seven o'Clock next Day, I was told, that Lewis had been in the House two or three Times, and had broke open the Door, and my Drawers, and took out a Diaper Table-cloth fringed, which cost me a great deal of Money; I lost that and the other Things.
Prisoner. I had a Warrant to take up the Prosecutrix, and one Longstaff, a Fellow that she keeps Company with; this shows the Maliciousness of the Prosecution; she lives in a little Alley in the Strand, and was at the Alehouse over-against her House; did not you come into the Alehouse, and abuse me, that Day you say these Things were lost? This Woman lodged in my House about six or seven Years ago; did not you?
Q. Did you lodge in his House about six or seven Years ago?


                  Ann 
                  Dawson 
               



            . No; he will say any Thing.
Prisoner. She went to Justice Frasier to swear this Robbery against me, and he would not take her Oath, he found her in so many Stories.


                  Ann 
                  Dawson 
               



            . There was a Lodger of mine that he had a Warrant against, who hid herself behind the Curtain, when he took the Things out of my Drawers, she is one of my Evidences.
Prisoner. The other Witnesses are all her Lodgers, they are all common Women of the Town.


                  Mary 
                  Fitzmorris 
               



            . On Friday before Michaelmas-Day, I came Home a little before nine at Night; and I was desired to keep up till such Time as Mrs Dawson came Home, that I might not be confined, because the Prisoner had a Warrant against me; the Prisoner came to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Dawson 
               



            's. and I went into the inner Room on the Ground-floor, to hide myself - I did not see him; I was told, he pretended to come with a Constable; and came in a very vile Manner, and swore he would have me; he b roke open the Chamber door on the Ground floor, and then he broke open the Drawers, and took out something - I saw a sringed Table-cloth under his Coat - he did not look for me when he came into the Room, but went directly to the Drawers, and broke them open.
Q. Did he think you were hid in the Drawers?
Fitzmorris. I cannot tell that.
Q. If he had looked about the Room might he have found you?
Fitzmorris. Yes, he might have found me; I was hid behind the Curtain - I had lived with Mrs Dawson about a Month - when he had got the Table-cloth he went away directly; I did not see him take any thing else.
Jury. What had he to break open the Drawers with?
Fitzmorris. The Drawers were all locked, and the Key was in one of the Drawers.
Q. Then he might have opened the Drawers with the Key; did he break them open?
Fitzmorris. He broke them open, because the Key was broke.
Jury. Did he break open the Door of the Room?
Fitzmorris. Yes - the Door was broke open, for I had locked myself in, but how he did it I cannot tell.
Q. Did you see him come in?
Fitzmorris. I did not see him at all - I did not see him that Night.
Prisoner. She said, she was behind the Curtain, and that she did not see me; and yet, she says, she saw me take out the Table-cloth; I had the Constable with me then.
Fitzmorris. The Constable was not there at all.


                  Ann 
                  Williams 
               



            . I never saw the Prisoner in my Life before he came into the House that Night, this was about eleven o'Clock, and the second Time of his coming; the first Time he came was about nine o'Clock, he came and asked for the Gentlewoman of the House, Mrs Dawson; he cursed and swore greatly, and bid me get out of the House; he came again in half an Hour's Time, and came in, in the same Manner; he said, there was a young Woman in the House which he had a Warrant for; that he was sure she was in the House, and he swore he would have her out; he said, he was sure she was in that Room, and broke the Door open, and went in there, and then broke open the Drawers.
Q. Was you in the Room with him?
Williams. No; no-body but the young Woman, who was behind the Curtain; I saw him, as he was going away, with the Fringe of the Tablecloth hanging out of his Pocket - I did not see the Constable near the House; the first Time you came, there was a tall Man in a Snuff coloured Coat with you; but the next Time you had no body at all with you - it was the Friday before Michael mas-Day - I am Mrs Dawson's Servant - I never spoke to you in my Life before that Night; only I have heard the Neighbours say what Sort of a person you are - it was the Chamber-door you broke open - I need not tell you what Time it was, for certainly you must know that.


                  Sarah 
                  Howard 
               



            . The Prisoner came into Mrs Dawson's, in Bennet's Court in the Strand, with a great many Oaths and Curses in his Mouth, and asked for Mrs Dawson, but she was not at Home; he said, he came after another young Woman, and pretended to be a Constable, and said, he must see the young Woman; I saw him break the Door open, but I did not see him take any Thing out of the Drawers.
Prisoner. Was there any talk of the Door being broke open, when we were before the Justice? There was no talk of any such thing then.
Howard. I said the same then as I do now; I insisted upon it then, that the Door was broke open.


                  Ann 
                  Dawson 
               



            . The Prisoner offered me twenty Guineas last Monday was a Week, to make it up, and brought Releases, but I would not do it.
Prisoner. Please to see this Warrant; this is a Warrant that I had to take up the Prosecutrix; this is a very malicious Prosecution.
Justice Deveil's Clerk deposed, that this was a Warrant granted by the Justice; Middlesex, &c. these are to command you, and every of you, to bring before me, or some other of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, the Bodies of

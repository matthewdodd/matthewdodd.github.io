SAMUEL FULTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of February, 1 till, value 6d.; 25 pence, 74 halfpence, and 52 farthings; the property of 



William Everest.






WILLIAM EVEREST
. I am a baker, and live at Woolwich. On Saturday evening, the 1st of February, in consequence of information I went out of my shop and called "Stop thief," and about twenty yards from the shop a person named Davis gave my till into my hand—it was dirty at the bottom, as if it had fallen down—there was then 6 3/4 d. in copper in it—as near as I can guess there was 6s. or 7s. worth of copper in it before—I went further, and found the prisoner in custody of a policeman.





THOMAS DAVIS
. I am a milkman, and live in Queen-street, Woolwich. I was coming down Church-street, Woolwich, about seven o'clock in the evening in question—I saw the prisoner running along with the till under his arm—I crossed the road to stop him—he dropped it—I took it up, and ran after him—I am sure he is the person—he was quite sober.





WILLIAM SMITH
. I am an officer, I took the prisoner into custody—he threw a handful of copper down into the middle of the road—I held him by the waist, and took up 9 1/2 d.

Prisoner's Defence. The money was mine.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

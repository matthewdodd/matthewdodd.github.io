CHARLES EAST
. I am in the service of Peter Pige, of Church-street, Becthnal green. On the 21st of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, from information I received, I went out of the shop, and saw the two prisoners, about thirty yards from it, running away together—Ipursued them—I passed King, and followed Birch—he ran up and down several streets—at last he entered a house, ran up stairs, and was concealing himself behind the door when I entered the room, seized him, and he dropped the trowsers at his feet—I took him to the station—he resisted—Ihad a struggle with him—he struck me, and I had a black eye, which I carried for a fortnight.





MARY MATTHEWS
. I keep a stall near the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoners walking backwards and forwards together, from ten to eleven o'clock—I then saw them run past in company together, and Birch was carrying the trowsers in his lap in an apron.

WILLIAM BARNS
 and 




GEORGE NARES
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
6th of July, 3 handkerchiefs, value 10s.; the goods of 



Thomas Marshall; and that Barns had been before convicted of felony.







CHARLES CRISP
. I am in the employ of Thomas Marshall, a hosier, in the Quadrant. About nine o'clock on Thursday evening, the 6th of July, the prisoners came into the shop together—Mr. Marshall was showing them some handkerchiefs, and serving some customers—I went up to the prisoners and asked what kind of handkerchiefs they wanted—Barns said they wanted a small one for a boy's neck—I showed him two or three more, then Nares said none of those I showed him were the kind they wanted, there was one hanging in the window of the sort he wanted—I turned to the window, and, on looking round, I saw Nares take three handkerchiefs from the counter, and put them under his coat—I collared him and took the handkerchiefs, and gave them to my master—Barns then ran out of the shop—I immediately pursued, and called out "Stop thief"—he was caught—Nares was kept in the shop, and was given into custody.

Barns. You said at the Police-office you only took two handkerchiefs from Nares. Witness. I said there were only two pieces, but in one piece there were two handkerchiefs—while I was gone after you, Nares threw this other one from his pocket.





WILLIAM CONNELL
 (police-constable C 136.) I took charge of Nares and these three handkerchiefs—Mr. Marshall handed this other handkerchief to me.





MARTIN KEAN
 (police-sergeant E 194.) I produce a certificate of Barns's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

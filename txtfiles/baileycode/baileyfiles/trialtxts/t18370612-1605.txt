WILLIAM DYKE
 (police-constable R 100.) On the 8th of June, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I fell in with the prisoner in Greenwich-road, about five or six yards from the prosecutor's—I searched him and found he had a shirt on over his own—he said he had it given him at Chatham.





ELIZABETH CREW
. I am the wife of Edward Crew, a labourer in Greenwich-road. This shirt is my grandson's, and belongs to my husband—I hung it out in the back garden, on Wednesday afternoon, the 7th of June.






MARY SKINNER

JOHN STEPHENSON
 (police-constable R 56.) I saw tire prisoner in London-street, Greenwich, about one o'clock that night, standing in a doorway—I searched him by my sergeant's orders, and he had nothing on him then—he said he had come from Gravesend and had no place to sleep.

Prisoner. I had the shirt given me at Gravesend.





CHARLES DAWSON
. I am a watchman of Woolwich. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness on the trial—he is the person.

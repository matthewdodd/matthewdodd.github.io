 was indicted

for stealing, on the

William Steventon, his master; and 1 coat, value 15s., the goods of

WILLIAM STEVENTON
. I live in Little Warner-street. The prisoner was employed to clean my boots and clothes—he did not live in house—he occasionally came into my room in the morning to take my clothes to brush—on the 27th of March I do not know whether he came into my room, as I was asleep—I went to bed about twelve o'clock, on Saturday night, leaving my watch in my fob, some gold in my waistcoat-pocket, and some silver in the trowsers—when I got up I missed my watch and money a sovereign and three shillings—the prisoner did not come to me that morning—I suspected him, and gave information—this is my watch (produced)—he had been nearly two months in my service.





WILLIAM BARTON
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody about half-past six o'clock in the morning on the 28th, and charged him with this felony—I searched him, and found he was wearing the coat, and had the watch in his pocket—he had 13s. in money.





CHARLES MARTIN
. I live in the prosecutor's house—this coat is mine—it hung on a peg, in the passage.

             (Police-constable E 85). I saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor into Duncannon-street


, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I there saw Buckley take the prosecutor's handkerchief, and give it to the other; I pursued Buckley, who ran away; my brother officer took Robinson.
Buckley. Q. Where did you first see us? A. In High-street; you had gone up Oxford-street, down Crown-street, and into St. Martin's-lane.

             (Police-constable C 31.) I was with Hobbs, and saw Robinson attempt several gentlemen's pockets; when they got to Duncannon-street I saw Buckley take the handkerchief out, and give it to Robinson - I went up and took him; he dropped the handkerchief, which I took up.

            . I am a broker
. I had a handkerchief taken from my pocket; I believe this was it - it was a similar pattern, but I cannot swear to the pattern; I knew nothing of it till the officer informed me of it.

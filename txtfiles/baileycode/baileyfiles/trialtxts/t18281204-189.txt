AUGUSTINE FREDERICK GODDARD. On the 29th of October I was at the corner of Wood-street, Cheapside


; I put my hand behind me, and found my pocket empty - I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I took it from him, collared him, and gave him in charge.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did he not say he found it on the ground? A.He did not - the crowd was so great that he could not have stooped to pick it up; he was close behind me - I do not recollect feeling any body at my pocket; whether I did, or whether I put my hand down by accident, I cannot say.

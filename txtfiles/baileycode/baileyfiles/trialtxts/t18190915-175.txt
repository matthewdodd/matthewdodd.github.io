            . I am headborough of Limehouse. On the 6th of August, I had information of a number of things being found in Mr. Gunn's brickfield at Limehouse, where the prisoner used to lay for the last six weeks - it was about half a mile from the prosecutor's. About seven o'clock in the morning, a moulder brought the things away; three people claimed them. I found the prisoner lying in the sack on Bow-common, with the axe under his head, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - this was on the 7th, about ten o'clock in the morning.

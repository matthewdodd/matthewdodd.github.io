            . I am a potatoe-dealer
, and live in King-street, Seven-dials - the prisoner was my porter
, and had 6s. a week; he received money for goods, which he delivered - Eleanor Fisher was a customer of mine. I sent her, by him, one hundred weight of potatoes, which came to 3s. 6d., on the 27th of February - he should have given me the money directly he came home - he never came home, but absconded - I met him two days afterwards in Holborn, and secured him.

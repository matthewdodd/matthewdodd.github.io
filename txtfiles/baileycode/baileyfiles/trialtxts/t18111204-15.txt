            . I live at Mill-bank Row, Westminster. On the 11th of last month I was in the Nag's Head public-house, Tothill Street, about ten o'clock, the two prisoners came in, I was drinking gin and water, I asked them to take some to drink, which they did, I sat there some time, and when I went out, they went out along with me. It rained very hard, I said I thought I should be locked out of my lodgings, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Till
               



             said she had a room, if I liked to go home with her for an hour or two, I told her I would go home with her, I went to her room, I sat myself down by the side of the bed, they were striking to get a light, and I fell fast asleep when they were getting a light, and in about an hour and a half I awoke by hearing the door shut, I found my stockings and shoes off, I felt for my pocket-book it was gone, and my purse was taken from my left hand breeches pocket, and my watch was gone also. I have it here now. I found my pocketbook on my left thigh, I felt inside of my pocket book, I found my notes were gone. I asked 
               
                  Mary 
                  Till
               



             if she new any thing of my money.
Q. Was the other prisoner present then there. - A. No. I asked 
               
                  Mary 
                  Till
               



             if she new any thing of my purse, my money, and my watch, she said no. I got off the bed and opened the window, I desired the watchman to come up and give me a light, in the mean time he was coming up stairs she told me that my watch was on the mantle piece, I found it there.
Q. How came you not to look there. - A. It was dark. The watchman came up and gave me a light, I asked 
               
                  Mary 
                  Till
               



             where the other prisoner was, she declared that she knew nothing of her, or of any money. I desired the watchman to go with me and take her to to the watch-house, he did and delivered her up to the night officer. Some of the notes have been found, and Mr. Edward's the gentleman that I took the notes off, is here to identify them

             was brought into the watch house by the watchman and the prosecutor, the prosecutor charged her with robbing him of four one pound notes and twenty-five or twenty-six shillings. I searched Till, I found nothing on her. On the next day I got a description of Wright. Cooper, I and the prosecutor went to the Fountain in Old Round Court, in the Strand. The prisoner Wright came in with two women, the prosecutor pointed out Wright, we took her into a private room and searched her, we found twelve shillings and sixpence on her, Cooper took her to Queen Square office; and I went to the watch house and took Till; on our way to the office Till said that she did not rob the man, but Wright did. Till said she had lodged her halves of the money in Mary Johnson's hands in the adjoining room to hers. I directly went to

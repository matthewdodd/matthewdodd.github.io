JOHN WRIGHT
. I am a merchant. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 24th of November, I was in Hatton-garden—I had a handkerchief—I felt a tug at my pocket, turned and missed my handkerchief—the prisoner was close to me—I took him by the collar, and held him—we went on a few paces—I told him he had my handkerchief—he said he had not—I proceeded a few paces, and a policeman came up and took him—a lad came up and said he saw the prisoner with a handkerchief in his hand, which he threw down; that a girl took it, and ran away with it.

Prisoner. You was pulling me towards another man—I said there was another man may have it as well as me. Witness. You said so, but you were nearest to me.





GEORGE ROBERT DENISON
. I was in Hatton-garden, and saw the prisoner with the handkerchief in his hand—he flung it away across Hatton-garden—some female took it up, and ran across Holborn with it.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear it was that gentleman's handkerchief? A. No.

Prisoner. I was returning home—I had been selling some laces—I was turning up Hatton-garden, and this gentleman laid hold of me by the collar, and accused me of having his handkerchief—I declare on my oath I never saw it.

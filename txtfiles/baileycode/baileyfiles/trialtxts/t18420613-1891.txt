HENRY GEORGE MUMBRAY
. I am a bookbinder, and live in Brunswick-place, City-road. About four o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday, the 1st of June, I was in St. James's-park—the policeman spoke to me—I felt in my coat-pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I told the officer the handkerchief was gone—he left me, and returned in about a minute,

with the prisoner—I saw the policeman take my handkerchief from the prisoner's breast—this is it—I had had it in my possession just before.





JOHN PHILLIPS
 (police-constable D 132.) I was in the Park on the 1st of June—I saw some persons standing round the Palace gates, and the prisoner also—I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take out his handkerchief, and put it into his breast—he went away—I spoke to the prosecutor, went after the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—



Transported for Ten Years.

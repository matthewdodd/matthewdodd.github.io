             . On the 26th of November, I missed ten Shillings, and found it hid in a Bird-Cage; I had some Reason to suspect the Boy; he confessed it to the Person that took him; here are the eight Shillings and four Six-pences. - He is a weekly Servant
 to me. - There were no Threatnings or Promises made use of.

            . Mr Hunt sent to me on the 26th of November last, and said he had a Suspicion of his Servant's robbing him; he carried him into the Kitchen, and charged him with taking ten Shillings out of the Till; at first he denied it, but soon after he owned it; and afterwards he confessed it before the Justice; there were no Promises of Favour, or any Thing of that Kind made to him. 

               Guilty

            . I live at Stanmore, and keep a shop in the ironmongery and braziery line. I bought a copper-pot of the prisoner on Wednesday morning for 4s. 6d. - he said it belonged to his mother, who sent him round with it; I sent to his father and mother to know if it were their's - they said No - the lid was left behind; it has been bruised and battered about; there is 14lbs. of that and the iron - I gave 6d. per lb. for it.

VIOLET ALEXANDER
 and

stealing, on the

Elizabeth Beauchamp.






ELIZABETH BEAUCHAMP
. I live at Hounslow-heath—I am a widow, and have six small children. On the morning of Sunday, the 26th of February, I missed seven hens and a cock—I was awoke in the night by the noise of the fowls—I got up, and saw Alexander (whom I well knew) and two men standing close to my stable-door, where I kept these fowls over the rack—I had seen them safe on the Saturday night—Fitzwater was one of the men—I saw him go into the stable and come out, and then the other man went in—I did not see Alexander go in—the fowls made a noise, and they went off—I was afraid to go after them—it was about half-put one o'clock.





ELIZABETH SMITH
. I live in part of the prosecutrix's house. I heard the fowls make a noise that night—I did not go down then, but I did afterwards, and saw the prisoner Alexander and two men, whom I do not know with her—Fitzwater was at my sister-in-law's that night, about a quarter of an hour after the cock crew—I do not know where he had been before.

Alexander's Defence. I never went inside the stable—there was one young man went up the alley with me, but not two.

Fitzwater's Defence. I know nothing about the thickens—I was at a

public-house, and did not come out till they were taken—I then steered towards home.

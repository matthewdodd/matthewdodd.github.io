                  JOHN 
                  NEEDHAM 
               



            . I can't say I have.
Q. to Hooper. When did you offer it in payment?
Hooper. I offered it the day it was due, with three days of grace, that was December 21.
Q. When did he write this paper you produce?
Needham. I saw him write it about two months ago.
Q. Did he write it in the same character as he us'd to write receipts?
Needham. He did.
Q. Had you seen him write before that?
Needham. I have, divers times before.
Q. Look at this note (in question) he takes it in his hand.
Needham. I believe it is no more his handwriting than it is mine.
Q. Is it your writing?
Needham. No, it is not.
Q. How does he write his name, Benjamin, Ba, or Be?
Needham. He writes it Be.
Q. How many s's in Nash ?
Needham. Only one.
Q. to Williams. How often do you think at most, you have seen Mr Nash write before Christmas last?
Williams. I believe I have seen him write five times.
Q. Have you ever seen him write his name Benjamin at length?
Williams. I don't know that ever I did.
Q. to Needham. Did you ever?
Needham. I never did, to my knowledge.
Q. Is the letter N in Nash as he usually writes ?
Needham. No; this is a large small n, he always us'd to make a large capital N.
Prisoner's defence.
I knowing myself innocent, never kept out of the way; the prosecutor wrote that note in my room, because he was bound in a bond of twenty pounds, and this he wrote to make the deficiency up to me; I gave him two guineas out of the money, and the remainder I put to the use that I wanted it for. I have often had money of him and he of me.
Q. to Needham. Is Nash looked upon to be a man of good circumstances?
Needham. He is, and has been, so long as I have known him.
Q. Has not he lately married his mistress?
Needham. He has.
Q. What were his circumstances before?
Needham. That I don't know; he was apprentice when I came there, he always paid me very honestly.
Q. Was he a poor fellow?
Needham. I never heard any body reckon him so.
Q. to Williams. When did he marry his mistress ?
Williams. About four months ago, or better.
For the prisoner.

Q. What relation is the prisoner to you ?

                  Nash 
               



            .
Q. How came you not to ask Mr Nash what he meant by going before a Justice of peace, and getting a warrant for your brother, when he own'd it to be his own hand-writing, by saying he would never hurt him?
Cockerham. What reason had I to ask him that?
Q. What was the purport of meeting Mr. Nash?
Cockerham. He sent me a letter in regard to the note.
Q. What about the note?
Cockerham. He said he had got a note come to his hand.
Q. What note?
Cockerham. The note which my brother, he said, had forged upon him.
Q. Did he ever own or deny to you, that it was his own hand-writing?
Cockerham. He never own'd or deny'd it.
Q. Then you did not treat it as a forged note.
Cockerham. I don't know that it can be prov'd to be his hand-writing.
Q. When he had said he would take up the note and pay it when due, what did you conclude then?
Cockerham. I concluded it had been a joint thing between them both.
Q. How a joint thing ?
Cockerham. I imagined it must be his own note.
Q. Was Mr Braddock by?
Cockerham. He was when the prosecutor declared he would never execute the warrant.


                  George 
                  Foster 
               



            . Mr Nash has told me in several companies, he would own the note, and take it up, and pay it whenever it became due.
Q. Who was in hearing of this?
Foster. There were the prisoner's brother Mr Cockerham, and a cooper in Thames-street, and Mr Braddock; he said he would not look after him; he said, while they were in friendship he would own it. I heard the prisoner say Mr Nash was bound in a bond for him for 20 l.
Cross Examination.
Q. What was the reason of the prisoner's leaving his lodging?
Foster. He lodg'd with his mother, and she was in trouble?
Q. What did Mr Nash mean by owning of it, did he say it was his note?
Frster. He never said to me that it was, or was not.
Q. Suppose you was to give a note, should you talk of owning your own note, or owning a note that another man made in your name?
Foster. If I made a note not intending to pay it, I might say I would own it, by way of screening my friend.
Q. Have you had any conversation with the prisoner at the bar about it?
Foster. I don't know that I am bound to answer your questions.
Q. Have you heard him confess this or not?
Foster. I never heard him really confess it; I once heard him say in a slight manner, Mr Nash and he knew very well how it came.
Q. Have not you heard the prisoner say something about the garret?
Foster. I heard him say he was in the garret when the note was made.

Q. Did you tell Mr. Needham the prisoner confess'd to you he made this note in his mother's garret?
Foster. I said to Needham, the prisoner confess'd to me, that Mr. Nash and he made it together?
Q. to Needham. Do you know Mr. Foster?
Needham. I do.
Q. What conversation had he and you together?
Needham. He told me a day or two before the note became due, that he had been along with Cockerham the prisoner, and he found how it was, and that Cockerham had drawn it in his mother's garret, and Mr. Howard did not like it, and he scratched the date out.
Q. Give an account of the very words that pass'd as near as possible?
Needham. Two or three days before the note came to hand, Foster came into my tap-room; he said he had been and found out Mr Cockerham and he told him.
Q. What Cockerham do you mean?
Needham. I mean the prisoner at the bar; he said, he told him that he 
               
                  drew
               


             the note himself in his mother's garret, and indorsed it to Mr Howard, and Mr Howard disliked the date of it and scratched it out, and dated it again, and paid it away to Mr Freeman in Woodstreet.

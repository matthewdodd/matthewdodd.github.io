JAMES CLARK
 and 




THOMAS WANKLIN
 were indicted for

 stealing 48 yards of mouslin de laine, value 4l., 16s. the goods of 



Silvanus Partridge and another; and that Clark had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM POUND
. I live in Duke-street, Westminster-road. I was in Cheapside on the 11th of March, and taw the prisoners in company with another—Wanklin had an empty bag—I saw the one who is not taken go into Mr. Brown's shop, bring something out under his arm, and deliver it to Wanklin, who gave it to Clark—I followed Clark to the middle of St. Paul's-churchyard, and took him with the bag on his shoulder with this property—Wanklin at that time returned back towards the shop in company with the other—he was taken on the 19th of March.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. How was Wanklin dressed? A. In a frock coat and sort of seal skin cap—he was taken in London-road in company with two others—I pointed him out, and the policeman took him—he had the same sort of cap on that day—I was in the police, and left in consequence of taking a drop too much.





JOSEPH LAMPITT
 (City police-constable, No. 604.) I took Clark with the bag on his shoulder with this property—I afterwards received charge, of Wanklin.





RICHARD PRICE
. I carry on business in Cheapside in partnership with Silvanus Partridge. This is our property.

Clark's Defence. I was in Cheapside; a young man asked if I would earn 6d., and gave me the bag to carry for him, and go round St. Paul's-church-yard; I had not gone far before this man took me.





WILLIAM POUND

re-examined. I saw them in company for ten minutes before he took it.





JAMES FRANKLIN
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner Clark's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the man.

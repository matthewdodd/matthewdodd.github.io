 (police-constable G 189.) I was in St. John-street a little before eight o'clock, on the night of the 8th of January—I saw the prisoner with this barometer in his hand—I laid hold of him, and asked him where he got it—he said a boy gave it him to hold—he was then about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's premises.





CHARLES PENHALLON

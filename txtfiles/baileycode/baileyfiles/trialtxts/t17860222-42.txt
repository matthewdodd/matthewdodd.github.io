             sworn.
I am wife to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner jump of our window; I called, stop thief! I missed a white apron, and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment; they were tied up ready in a corner of the window, which is about six feet from the ground; there was light enough to see him, I knew him before, he had lodged at our house.

I saw the prisoner come out of the window; I attempted to take him, but he was rescued; I am sure the prisoner is the man, he was taken the next day.
Prisoner. I was not near the place; I have neither witnesses nor friends.

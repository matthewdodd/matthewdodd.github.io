JOHN TIDD
, was again indicted

for stealing 3 gowns and other articles, value 12l. 19s., and 1 10l. Bank-note; the property of 



Martha Staker, in the dwelling-house of 



George Gardner.






MARTHA STAKER
. On 5th July I was living in Cadogan-place. I had three gowns and other articles in my box, and a 10l.-note was on the table—the prisoner was there—these things were gone in the morning—some of the articles are here now—these are mine, but they are not all I lost.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN. Q. After these things had been pawned did the prisoner bring the tickets to you? A. Yes, I could not read—he said they were property of his—he left me on 8th July—I did not miss the articles till he was gone—I asked Mrs. Gardner to read the duplicates to me.

COURT. Q. Were these the produce of your earnings in service? A. Yes.





EDWARD TALBOT
. I am a pawnbroker. I have some articles which I took in of a female—the prisoner was with her when they were pawned.

Cross-examined, Q. Had you seen the prisoner before? A. Yet; I knew him well.





GEORGE GARDNER
. I live at 20, Cadogan-place, in the parish of Mary-lebone—Martha Staker lodged there.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner).

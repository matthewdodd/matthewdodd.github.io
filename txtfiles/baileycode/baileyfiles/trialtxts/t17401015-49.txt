Mrs Maccartey. On the thirteenth Day of this Month, between 6 and 7 at Night, I was in a little Room behind my Shop, and saw the Prisoner take my Goods out of the Window; I lost as much Silk as would make 6 Handkerchiefs; one ready made up, and a Bit of blue Ribbon which hung over them. I saw him take them, and remember him perfectly well.

Mr Dowling. I was sitting with this Gentlewoman, in her little Room, and she cry'd out, that a Man had taken something out of the window. I immediately ran to the Door, and saw the Prisoner running along; I pursued him, and one of our Workmen happening to come by, catch'd the Prisoner in his Arms, and stopped him. We found nothing upon him, but the blue Ribbon was lying within 2 or 3 Yards of his Feet.
Prisoner . He says I was running along, but I was only walking when I was taken. 

               Guilty

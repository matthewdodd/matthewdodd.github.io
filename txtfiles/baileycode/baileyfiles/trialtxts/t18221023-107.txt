            , to take care of a warehouse where furniture is let out, at No. 11, Edward-street, Portman-square. I live in Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. On one Sunday I called at the warehouse, and, in consequence of what passed, I went to No. 2, Park-street, Grosvenor-square, and inquired for 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Berry
               



            ; I did not see him; it was a very good house, fit for a gentleman. I saw a person there, who represented himself as his housekeeper; and, in consequence of what passed between her and myself, I was perfectly satisfied, and sent the goods stated in the indictment to the house, with an inventory of them, and the terms of hire per week, which was 10 s. 6 d.; they were delivered on the 8th October, 1821; I had not then seen Mr. Berry; on the following Monday the week expired, and the housekeeper brought back a pair of sheets and pillowcases, and paid 10 s. 6 d. for the week's hire. In the afternoon an order was sent for six more tablespoons for one night's use, which I sent without a list; and about three days after I sent the porter for the spoons; he did not bring them, nor have I seen them since. Five or six weeks after, not having received any more money, and hearing something, I applied for the arrears, and saw a person who I understood to be Mrs. Berry; I got neither goods or money from her. A few days after I called again, and saw the servant. I went several times until the 21st of December, when I was determined not to leave till I got satisfied. I was in the house about an hour and a-half, and while there, the prisoner came in, the servant said to him,
"I am glad you are come, Sir, for this man has been very insolent, and refuses to leave the house;" he walked up into the drawing-room with me. I said, Mr. Berry, I have come for the goods which you have belonging to my master; and out of the house I cannot go without the goods or the hire." I told him where I came from, and shewed him the list of the goods; he said his wife was in the country - she had the property locked up, and that on Saturday on her return they should be given up, and the hire paid. I left very dissatisfied, and said I would not quit the house; he then took out his pocket-book, and shewed ten or twelve bills of exchange to the amount of about 2000 l. He picked out one for 150 l., which he said was the smallest, and I was to hold it as security until the following Saturday, when he would return the goods, and I left (the bill was here produced, dated 1st November, 1821, upon

            , accepted, due the 4th of September, 1822, and endorsed by the drawer.) There was pen and ink there; but I said he should not endorse it, as I should not put it into circulation. On the Saturday I called several times, but could not see him. I never saw him again till 3d October, 1822, when he was in custody; I never afterwards found any body at the house but one maid-servant; I saw his wife afterwards in Clerkenwell prison. When the bill became due, I presented it at No. 6, Trinity-court; there is no Trinity-square, there was no number on the bill; I found a 
               
                  John 
                  May
               



             lodged in a garret at No. 6, Trinity-court; I did not see him, but his wife; I was not paid; I could find no other

                  May
               



            ; I found the prisoner, in October, at a furnished-house, No. 42, Edgware-road, of which he appeared master; I got an officer, and took him; he denied having seen me before, and repeated that before the Magistrate; I at last produced the bill; he then faultered, and said he believed he had seen me once before, but persisted that he had never received the goods. He did not ask me for the 150 l. bill; I saw him searched; 4 1/2 d. was found on him, and an old gilt chain without a watch. I have recovered none of the goods.
Prisoner. Q. When you called, did I not say I knew nothing of the goods. A. No; he said his wife had them locked up.

            . I was porter at the warehouse in October, 1821. I delivered the goods at No. 2, Park-street, with a bill of them. I went on the Monday following, with six tablespoons - I took no account with them; they were never returned to me. I went for them once. I never saw the prisoner.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended him by Calford's direction; he said he never saw Calford - that he heard of the name - but knew nothing of the business; he sneered at it

            . I am proprietor of the furnished house, No. 2, Park-street, Grosvenor-square. On the 3d of October, I let it to Mr. and Mrs. Berry, for the year, at 190 l. The prisoner said they came from Worcester, and they could only give reference to two houses in the city; they referred me to Bull and Brooksbank, No. 5, Adam's-court, at the back of the Bank - who the prisoner said were their agents, and said he was a gentleman coming to reside in town with his aunt. I went to Bull and Co., who gavehim a very excellent character. I never got a quarter's rent, and could hear no more of Bull and Co. Calford applied to me; I gave him information. They went from my house, a little before the quarter was due, all but the maid-servant. On my coming in, she said she had received a letter from Mrs. Berry, to meet her in Portman-square. I sent a person with her to meet her mistress, but she ran away.
Prisoner's Defence. I never had the goods, or saw them - and Mrs. Berry says she never ordered them, nor ever paid any thing for the hire of any thing in the house.

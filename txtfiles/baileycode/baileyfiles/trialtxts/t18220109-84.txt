            , he lives at the corner of Dorset-street, Spitalfields


. On the 5th of January, at half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoners near there, and watched them. Sandford had two empty baskets; they turned the corner, and in about five minutes, I saw Sandford opposite the shop without the baskets. Mason came out of the shop with a basket, containing eight dozen plates, and was carrying them away. I stopped him, and asked what he was going to do with them - Sandford ran away, he said he was going to carry them round the corner - I took him to the watch-house.

            . The prisoners were strangers to me; I knew Mason by sight, I had such plates as these, I sold none to them - My boy absconded the same day.

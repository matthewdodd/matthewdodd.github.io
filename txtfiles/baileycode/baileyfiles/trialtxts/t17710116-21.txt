            . I keep a hosier's and haberdasher's shop
 in Piccadilly


; the prisoner came into my shop about nine o'clock last Saturday night; she said, some gentlemen were to meet her there at six o'clock to buy her a gown, and some articles in my business, and that as he had not come at that time, she supposed he would come about nine. I asked her to set down and wait for the gentlemen, which she did; after she had set some time, she said, the gentlemen had disappointed her twice, and she went out. I had some mistrust of her, for I saw her hovering about the window. I was serving a gentleman with some stockings; she came in again and asked the gentlemen were come. I had seen her waiting about the door all the time. She staid some time whilst a many people came into the shop; there were two pair of stockings on the other side of the shop; I missed one and a parcel from the opposite counter. I went up to her; I pushed back her cloak and found the bundle of stockings, which were seven pair; she was then in the middle of the shop; she ran away to the end of the compter, and dropped a pair of mixed thread stockings.
Q. Had they any marks upon them?
Goldwin. Yes, there was my own mark upon the paper.
Prisoner's Defence.
My lord they were not about me.

JOHN PAINTER. I live at No. 2, King's Head-court, Beech-street, Barbican. On the morning of the 9th of March, I was waiting for a job in Newgate-street


; I saw the prisoner jump up behind a poultry cart, and take this coat off; he put it on his shoulder, and ran down Butcherhall-lane - I overtook him, brought him back, and gave him to the officer.
Prisoner. He says that I jumped up into the cart, but it was too low - he is swearing all false. Witness. No, it is true - he swung on the back of the cart, and got it.
DANIEL CABLE. I am a poulterer
, and live at Barking, in Essex. This is my coat; it was in my poultry cart, near the front of it - I should have thought it hardly possible to get it without getting into the cart; he must have laid along on his belly to get it - there was only one basket in the cart.
JAMES MITCHELL. I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and have the coat, which I got from Painter.
Prisoner's Defence. A man gave me 3d. to carry it.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . Aged 15. - 


               Transported for Seven Years

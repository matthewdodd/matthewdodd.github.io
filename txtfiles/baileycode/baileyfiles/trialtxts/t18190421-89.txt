JOHN BERY COLE. I am a jeweller
, and live in Barbican


. On the 24th of April, about a quarter before eight o'clock at night, I was writing at the back of the shop, and heard a great bustle in the street - I went out, and found the prisoner in custody. My window was broken, and five or six gold keys taken out of a tray - the window had been broken before, but was mended and quite secure; the putty was cut away. We had lit candles above an hour.

            . I live next door to Mr. Cole. About a quarter before eight o'clock on Saturday evening, as I stood at my door, I observed three men huddled close together at Cole's window - I watched them, and could see distinctly what they were doing, as I was above them. There were lamps in the window, and I have a gas-light over my door. The prisoner was the middle man. I observed him busy at the second pane of glass, he was hooking something out with a piece of brass wire. I went up and collared him, the other two immediately ran away. He struck me, and made my lip bleed. At the time I took him, he was in the act of hooking the things out with the wire.

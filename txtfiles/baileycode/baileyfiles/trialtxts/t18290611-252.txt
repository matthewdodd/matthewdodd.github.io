            . I am a widow. I was in Whitecross-street


 on the night of the 21st of April, at ten minutes before twelve o'clock; the prisoner took my shawl off my shoulders and threw it to another person; I caught the prisoner, but I never got my shawl again; I am certain she is the person who took it - I gave her to the watchman.

            . The prisoner and another person passed me about a quarter before twelve o'clock - I passed on down Chequer-alley, and saw the prosecutrix with the prisoner in custody, charging her with stealing the shawl; she denied knowing any thing about it.
WILLIAM HORNSBY. I am a watchman. The prosecutrix passed me with a large shawl on; I assisted in taking the prisoner; the prosecutrix had no shawl on then - she said the prisoner had taken it; the prisoner denied it, and kept laughing; the prosecutrix appeared quite sober, though flurried.
Prisoner's Defence (written). I was going home, through Whitecross-street, when two or three persons ran with great violence against me, which nearly knocked me down, and before I could get over the shock, the prosecutrix took hold of me, and accused me of stealing her shawl. Knowing my innocence, I did not attempt to get away, which (in consequence of the state of intoxication the prosecutrix was in) I might easily have done.

               stealing, on the 11th of March

                        Newman Francis Robinson

                  , from his person
            .
NEWMAN FRANCIS ROBINSON McGOWRAN. I am a general-dealer
 and live in Tavistock-row, Covent-garden


 - the prisoner was in my employ and served behind my counter
. On the 11th of March, I sent him with two sovereigns and 8l. in silver to a customer at the Piazza coffee-house - he was to leave it with any one in the bar, but he went away and I saw no more of him; I expected him to have returned in about three minutes - I did not see him again till the 22d of April, when I found him by the direction of a lad who went to the same charity-school with him. When he was apprehended he said he was guilty - he hung down his head and said he took it, I believe.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 22d of April, I went with the prosecutor to the Coach and Horses public-house, in St. Martin's-lane; I found the prisoner in a back room with two others - I took him into the tap-room, and he said "It is all right, I am guilty of it"- I said "What have you done with the money?" he said he had bought some clothes, and pawned them and sold the duplicates, and another boy helped him to spend the money.
Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.

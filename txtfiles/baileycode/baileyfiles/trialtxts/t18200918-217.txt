            . I am butler to the Earl of Morton. On the 29th of August, I was in the pantry, and laid the spoon in the window, which looks into the area. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come down the area, and as he did not ring the bell I went to watch him, and saw him earnestly looking in at the window. Before I got to the hall door, I heard the pantry window open - ran back and saw his hand reaching in and take the spoon; I ran out to seize him - he threw the spoon down under the window and escaped - he had moved it about two feet. I followed him calling Stop thief! he knocked a man down, who tried to stop him. He was secured before I lost sight of him. He dropped it into the sink.

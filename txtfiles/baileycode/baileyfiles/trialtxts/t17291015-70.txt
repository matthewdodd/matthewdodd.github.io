               stealing a Shirt, &c

            , the 13th of this Instant
 October.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoners came into her House, and call'd for a Pint of Purl, and while she was gone down to draw it, took the Opportunity to take the Shirt out of the Dresser-Drawer; that Thompson went away immediately, but Bishop staid in the House; and that after he was charg'd with it, he offer'd to make Satisfaction for it; but said he could not help the Prosecutor to it again. The Fact being prov'd upon Thompson, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.
             But there being no Evidence against Bishop, he was 

               acquitted
            .

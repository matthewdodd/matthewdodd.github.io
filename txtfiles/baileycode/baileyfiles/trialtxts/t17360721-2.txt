            . My Master is a Haber-dasher
, and the Prisoner used the Shop. We suspected her, and counted the Ribbons over, and set the Number on the Box. On the 24th of June, she came for half a yard of 8 penny Ribbon. I served her, and the Minute she was gone, I missed the Ribbon. My fellow Servant ran after her, and brought her back, we searched her; but found nothing upon her.

            . My fellow Servant and I had counted the Ribbons over a little before she came into the Shop; the former Witness served her, and the Minute she was gone, he told me, he missed a piece of Ribbon, green Saxe Gotha; and I am positive it was in the Drawer just before. I pursued her, and took her in the Little Minories Gate way, and brought her back; then we got a Constable and carry'd her before a Justice, and at the Bull Head in Bread street, she said, if my Master would be favourable, she would tell us where the Ribbon was, and according to her Directions, we found it hid behind some Shutters, which stand under that Gate-way. I pushed the Shutters, and the Ribbon fell down.

               Guilty. 10 d.

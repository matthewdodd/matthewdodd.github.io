ROBERT COLEBERD. I am a wine-merchant
. On the 15th of September I was in Soho-square


, at a quarter to one o'clock, a man ran up and took my watch-chain and two keys; I had a bottle of gin on my back - he snatched it under my arm; I cannot tell who he was; I called Stop thief! the officer pursued, and brought the prisoner back in two minutes; the person was about his size.

            . I am a silver chaser. I was in Swallow-street, going towards Soho-square, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I met the prisoner running, and stopped him; he used a violent oath, and put himself in a fighting attitude, and made a blow at me; I struck him again; he ran off; I pursued with others, and caught him in a court - he got from me again; I still pursued, and secured him.

            . I am an officer. I was in Soho-square, and saw the prisoner and two others coming from Charles-street - the prisoner left the other two, and went into the road; I followed him till we met the prosecutor; the prisoner went up to him on the side on which the bottle was on his shoulder; he snatched at his watch, and ran off immediately; Coleberd called Stop thief! I pursued, and lost sight of him, as he turned into Sutton-street; I came up, and took him from Bean; I knew him before.

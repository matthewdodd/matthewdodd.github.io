, and live in Green's-court, St. James'. Last Tuesday morning, at half-past one o'clock, I was in Drury-lane


; Monday was St. Crispin's day - I had been at a house of call for shoemakers, and was late going home; I was the worse for liquor, and sat down at a door - I fell asleep, and my hat was taken, my pockets turned inside out, and the money taken.

            . I was coming along Drury-lane, and saw the prosecutor sitting at the door; the prisoner took his hat off, and ran away - I followed, and stopped her; she had run forty or fifty yards: I gave her to the Police-constable - this is the hat.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Drury-lane; I saw the prisoner with this hat in her hand - she was given to me by Grover, and I took her to the watch-house; I found only 4d. on her - she was not in liquor.
Prisoner's Defence. I do not recollect being in his company at all - I was very much in liquor.

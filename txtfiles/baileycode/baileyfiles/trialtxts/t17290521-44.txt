            , and 
               
                  
                     Hannah 
                     Merrit 
                  



                
            , of St. Dunstan's Stepney



, were indicted, the former for 


               breaking the House of 
                     
                        Bridges 
                        Wats 
                     



                    in the Night-Time, the 18th of April last, and stealing a Silver Tankard, and fifty two Pewter Plates
            ; and the latter for 


               receiving them, knowing them to be stolen
            . The Prosecutor depos'd, that his House was broken open, and that the Window seemed to have been forced with a Crow; that 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Merrit 
               



             told him, that she had received the Goods, and had either sold or pawned them. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Simpson 
               



             depos'd, that 
               
                  Ann 
                  Merrit 
               



             brought the Tankard and Plates to her House. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Dixon 
               



             depos'd, that whereas there was a Hat found in the House, it was Hickterbal's Hat. The Evidence not making it out that the House was broken in the Night-time, the Jury 


               acquitted him of the Burglary, and found him guilty of the Felony only
            . And 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Merrit 
               



             having inform'd the Prosecutor voluntarily of her having received the Goods, the Jury 

               acquitted
             her.

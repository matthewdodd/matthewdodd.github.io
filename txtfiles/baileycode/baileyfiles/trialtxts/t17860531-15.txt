             were again indicted for 


               feloniously receiving the same, on the 5th day of March

 last, knowing them to have been stolen
            .
(The indictment opened by Mr. Fielding, and the case opened by Mr. Silvester.)
Gentlemen; this mine is at Chiswick; this is a black lead mine; the only mine of that kind either in England, or in the known world; the property therefore is very considerable; and the lead that comes out of it is of great value; it is opened as the consumption requires, every six, seven, eight, or nine years, and then filled up again with water, so that it is impossible that any person can commit a felony there, besides which, there is an act of parliament made for the very purpose of protecting this mine; when the mine is opened Mr. Banks, who is possessed of one half of it, and the other proprietor

s, who have the other half in different shares, send two persons to escort it to London; their repository is in Essex-street



; under Mr. Lindsey's chapel, is a large cellar, there is an iron gate, then there is a gate, which goes into the cellar; there are two keys, one kept by Mr. Banks, the other by Mrs. Fox, for herself, and the rest of the proprietors; in the first cellar some black lead is kept, that is refuse; on the right, further in the cellar, is another cellar, in which the black lead, which is afterwards to be disposed of is kept; to that cellar likewise there are two keys; the warehouse for sale is in Fetter-lane; and therefore when they come to this house in Essex-street for the purpose of conveying it, Mrs. Fox always attends, and Mr. Bankes's agent frequently; on the 6th of August last, was the time when this repository was opened for the purpose of conveying a certain quantity of black lead, from thence to Fetter-lane; in Fetter-lane I think the sale is once a month only throughout the year, and that for a certain time; in August, when the last parcel was conveyed, it was locked safe, the key was left with Mrs. Fox, and the other was sent by Mr. Banks's agent to him, and sealed up in a paper, and every thing was left in proper order. On the 4th or 5th of March last, a maid servant observed some foot steps on the snow, and some black dust scattered on this white snow; it did not strike her particularly; but on the next evening a gentleman's servant coming from Mr. Lindsey's, who lives in Essex-street, observed a man within the railling, he had something like a firkin, which he threw down and ran away; another man, which he believes to be Oliver, was seen there, he escaped; upon examining the cellar, they found that the lead had been stolen which you have heard mentioned in this indictment, and out of the cellar where the valuable lead was, one firkin was carried off, the others were removed, and only that one which was seen by the servant, was conveyed away from the premises; advertisements were put in the papers, and a reward offered for any one that would discover that firkin, as it brings twenty-five shillings in the pound, and being about eighty pounds, it makes the value about 100 l. one of the persons concerned in the robbery made a discovery. Gentlemen, so strong and secure was the door in which this lead was put, that they were obliged to break down the wall. The accomplice Wilford being examined, gave this account: that on the 2d of March, he and those four men, having had information, that a very great and valuable commodity was kept in this cellar in Essex-street, where they might easily do it, as the phrase was; on the 2d of March they went there with an iron crow, which in their way they call a rook, they found this was not sufficient, they got more made; and on the 4th of March, they went, and with force and violence broke open this place; that the first day, on the Saturday, they took out of the cellar these four boxes, which they afterwards sold; but being informed that there was some better, they broke open that door, and were in the act of taking these firkins out of it, if they had not been disturbed; that he was the person who went off with the first firkin, when he came to St. Clement's church, where he was to wait to take a coach, and convey it to the house of the prisoner Bray; that he heard the cry of stop thief, and that Oliver was the person who endeavoured to make his escape. The advertisement likewise went into the hands of a man of the name of Barew; he said, he was applied to by Bray for the purpose of buying some lead, that he applied to a man of the name of Barnet to go with him to see what it was worth; Barnet, who was a deale in pencils, told him that was the common sort, and for the parcel he only offered four guineas; and one of the prisoners, I do not know which, made use of this odd expression,
"d - n my blood, here is a fine rigg indeed, four of us to go to the new drop, for four guineas;" they then told him, on Monday, he should have a better parcel, and when the money was paid, all the prisoners were present. On the Monday they came and sent to Bray's house, and Bray with the assistance of the other prisoner's wife Dawson, brought it from underneath the bed; it was then shewn to Mr. Barrew, and Mr. Barnet, and an agreement was made for it; they then lamented, that they should have had a great deal more; but were disturbed; they then told him, they had been breaking the wall for the purpose of getting into that place, and therefore they were only able to carry off one firkin, and left the rest; but Oliver told them, that he had in fact been boned, or bobbled, or something like that, which was understood to be, that he had been taken into custody, and had been stopped, but had made his escape. Gentlemen, I have only opened the outlines of this case, many facts will come out much stronger; but in regard to the mine, there is none in this kingdom or any other that is known of at present, of the species of black lead; the proprietors once a month, and only once a month, dispose of it to the trade for two hours, and when they come for the purpose, and want it to make pencils of, they toss up who shall have the first choice; in this property, therefore, there will be no difficulty, as to the identity; because it will be in evidence to you that there are no other persons but these proprietors that can be entitled to it. Gentlemen, the evidence against the first four, against the principals, will be the evidence of an accomplice, corroborated in many circumstances, by the evidence of Barrew and Barnett, who were present, and by the evidence of the servant, who will tell you of one person going off with a firkin; some of the property will be produced to you; and Barew and Barnet will tell you, that the prisoners were all present at the time it was shewn them. The evidence against Bray, and M'Glew, and Dawson, will be his; Bray was active in selling and purchasing this commodity, Dawson conveyed the property from one house to another, and M'Glew also; and there is no doubt but they will come under the description of that offence, of receiving this lead knowing it to be 
stolen.

FRANCIS BILL sworn.
What persons of your name are proprietors of these lead works? - Charles, John, and Mary.
Have any other persons of your name any share in these works? - No, they have not.
To Mrs. Fox. Do you know the cellars in Essex-street that contained this lead? - Yes.
In what manner was it secured? - The door was secured by two locks, one of the keys is in the custody of Mr. Banks; I keep the other key for myself, and the other proprietors; the 2d of August last, I saw this cellar opened, and locked up again.
Was it ever opened since to your knowledge, and by your consent? - No.
Can you speak of any lead being missed out of the cellar, when you was first apprised of this robbery being committed? - I was first apprised of the robbery on Sunday the 5th of March; I came to the place, and saw a vast croud of people, then I went home and got my key, and I found the outer cellar door which opens inwards, forced inwards, the staples were drawn, and the bolts were bent, it appeared to be forced open; the next thing we observed, was the cellar on the left hand was forced open, and three or four boxes missing; the lead I first saw, in the first cellar, was of the best kind, and was brought out of the inner cellar; the door not opening in the same manner that the other did, in order to force the door open, they had been obliged to make a considerable hole in the wall, to get a particular crow in.
How long was this hole in the wall? - More than a foot, and by the means of that hole they had effected that purchase, which opened the door in the inner cellar; we observed several casks to be moved, we saw the place clear where the casks had stood; I was in the cellar the 2d of August.
What quantity of lead was lost? - I apprehend one cask, and four boxes of the best was lost; the casks generally run eighty pounds weight, at twenty-five shillings per pound, which is pretty near one hundred pounds; the lead in the boxes were of an inferior quality.
In what manner is this lead disposed of in your sales? - We have another house in Fetter-lane, where we have a sale once a month, for two hours, it never happens that so large a quantity as a cask sold; I am informed there is none of this sort of lead in England; that house in Fetter-lane is the only one in England in that way.
Mr. Knowles, prisoner's counsel. Do you happen to know Mrs. Snell? - No.
Do you know whether she is at this time married? - No.
What is she? - She was a widow.
Do you know Mrs. Frederick? - No more than by the name.
Is she a widow? - She is called spinster.
How do you know that? - She has always been represented to me as such.
Do you know whether all these gentlemen that are now named are living?
Court. Have you any evidence to prove the men dead, or the women married? - No.
At these sales in Fetter-lane, what quantity is generally disposed of; do you sell to the amount of a cask and four boxes at a time? - No, never.

            . I was at the opening of these mines, in May, 1778; I attended it alternately with Mr. Banks's agent; we packed it in butter firkins, and attended it to the Kendal cart, there we delivered it to the London waggons, and took their receipt; I did not attend the delivery, at the waggon in London; when we have taken out the lead, we fill it up with mud, and then let in water, so as to make it impracticable for any one else to work it; then we cover the mouth of the pit with rubbish and stones, and there are locks; besides there is a house over the mouth of the pit, and that is locked up.
Did you attend at the warehouse in Essex-street, in August, 1785? - I did, I locked the door myself, and I gave one key to Mrs. Fox, as I always do; Mr. Banks's agent takes the other; there are two different locks, and two different keys; I went the next day after it had been broke to see the state of the warehouse; the outer locks were both forced, and the cellar on the left hand side was broke; there were the marks where four or five casks of the best lead had been taken away; there were between three and four casks missing; it is twenty-five shillings a pound; the coarse lead may be worth four or five shillings a pound.

            , Esq; sworn.
There are three keys; I have a key of the outer door, and of the door where the best lead is contained, and of the inner cellar; my agent delivered me the key immediately after the opening, sealed up; I never parted with it from that time; I know it was never in Mrs. Fox's possession; I am not perfectly sure, whether, when I went out of town, I did not leave it sealed up; it was intended we should open the cellar for the purpose of taking out some more head.

I am servant to Mr. Gregor, No. 28, Carey-street; on Sunday the 25th of March, I went to Mr. Lindsey's house in Essex-street; at the time we were within the house, we heard a noise, I said, I heard a knocking; the maid said, there was a book-binder at the next house; I had no suspicion of any robbery, coming out, I perceived a man going out of the iron gate, which goes into the street, with something on his back like a barrel, or like a butter firkin; when I came down the steps, I saw a man come out of the cellar door, which is on the right hand; as I came down the steps, I enquired of him, what business he had there, he said, he had only been to ease himself; I told him in these words, as near as I can recollect, that he was a d - nd eternal liar; I immediately went and shut the iron gate within side, and kept myself there; he jumped out over the iron gate; I believe him to be Oliver; I ran after him; he fell down, nobody assisted me, and I lost him in St. Clement's church-yard; I returned back immediately to the chapel, and went and examined the cellar, thinking there might be some more in it, but there was not; when I came to the cellar door, there were two of these bars, and on the right hand, there hung two or three bags; I went into the cellar; there was an old lanthorn with a candle burning in it; I had not been long there, before some people came down to know who it was cried stop thief; I ran into the street, and they told me he was taken; it was a little after eight, and a clear night; I really believe him to be the man, to the best of my knowledge; we were but a trifling time scuffling, I was fatigued with travelling; when I was in Bow-street, I went over to the Bear, and picked him out of a great many people; I believe there might be about twenty there.
Prisoner. Some of the thief-takers persuaded him? - No, Sir; one of the men asked me if I would go the Brown-Bear, and I did, and I looked at the prisoner, and said he was the man; nobody told me.

I know Mr. Bray, and Oliver, and Baggally, and Dawson. On Sunday, the 5th of March, between nine and ten in the morning, I met 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bray
               



             and M'Glew; Bray asked me if I would buy any blacklead; Bray and I went into a public house, and he shewed me a very small piece of black-lead; I told him I was no judge of black-lead, but I could shew it to a person that was; I drank a glass of liquor with him; it was to be at his house in George-yard, Union-court; M'Glew did not go into the house; I met Barnet, and shewed him the piece of lead I had from Bray; he said it was a good bit, but he could be no judge of so small a piece; we went to Field-lane, and I went to the house of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bray
               



            , and I left Barnet in the street; when I came to Bray's house, there were several people in the house, but I cannot be particular to any of them, except to Mr. M'Glew and Bray, and to the best of my knowledge, Oliver and Baggally.
Was Wilford there? - Not to my knowledge; I told Bray that I could not tell any thing by that bit; accordingly, he gave me some in a paper, near half a pound, a small piece; I then took it out to Barnet, and shewed it to him in the street; he gave me an answer, that he could not tell by that, and must see the whole; I told Bray; he said, is your friend an honest man, and to be trusted with the sight of it? He either supposed it to be smuggled or not honestly come by, by that expression; I understood by that expression, whether the man would give any information; I fetched 
               
                  Henry
                   Barnet
               



             to the house; he then took a very bright key, and went to a house a little distance from his own house, and opened a door up two pair of stairs, and there was some lead, the same sort of the sample.
Whose house does that turn out to be? - I cannot say; I have been told it is Mr. M'Glew's, but I never enquired; the other people might follow, but I did not see them; Bray then shewed me this lead. (Produced and deposed to.) There was some in this bag, and some in a basket.
What conversation passed between you and Bray on the occasion? - Bray asked me ten guineas for it in the lump; I never weighed it; Barnet told me it was a very inferior sort, but nevertheless, give four guineas for it; then Bray agreed that I should have it; then he went down stairs to get some person or other to take it away: after he had been gone down some little time, 
               
                  Mary
                   Dawson
               



             came up with a key in her hand, and said I was not to have the lead for that money; I refused quitting the room; and I desired Bray might come up, and let me know what the difference was; he came up alone, and I agreed to give him four guineas and a half; I gave him two guineas in part; Dawson came as a porter to carry it away; he was not employed by me; he took it away; I put the remainder in two handkerchiefs, and the prisoner Buckey, whose name is Oliver, he came in with a handkerchief to carry it along with me, being Sunday; I then gave Bray two guineas, and one of these two guineas he gave to Oliver; Barnet was there; M'Glew was present, but I do not know whether he received any of the money. On Sunday, Bray asked Barnet the difference between the good and the bad; he said, if this is not the good, which is the good? Barnet said it was larger, and cut fine; Bray then asked if we would call on the Monday, and he would get some other; on the Monday morning I called on Barnet to go and lock at a better sort; they came to Bray's house, when Bray brought two parcels, one in an apron tied, and one in a table-cloth, and shewed it to Barnet and me; this was better lead, but not quite the best; Bray asked ten guineas for that; there was between thirty and forty pounds of that; Bray said, upon my asking whether he had got any more, they had like to have had four or five more casks, but they had only got one cask; they had been a matter of three hours at work, and one of them had like to have been taken, and they had broke through a strong wall; I did not agree for the lead, Barnet advised me not to buy it; on the Tuesday evening following I saw Mr. Bray, and he told me he had sold the lead, and made all the money he asked for it, to one Phillips; on Saturday in the afternoon, between four and five, Mr. Barew came to my house; I went with him; Bray said there was a very great noise, and the people concerned in stealing it would be taken; and he advised me to go out of London, and promised to take care of me, if I went out of London; but I gave information; the lead has been under my care ever since.
Mr. Knowlys. Are you any relation to a man of the name of Uzziel Barew? - I am not.
This is not the first time you have been in this Court? - No.
The situation in which you stand is not the only one in which you have appeared here; have not you stood, for instance, where these men stand now? - I do not know that I have any right to answer that.
Mr. Silvester. You must produce the record? - If I have been unfortunate, here is my pardon.
Mr. Knowlys. Then I believe you have stood there? - I admit I did.
What was it for? - I cannot tell particularly.
No good act, I dare say? - I do not think I have any right to tell.
You was convicted? - Yes.
Is that the only time you have appeared here as a criminal? - Yes.
Mr. Justice Willes. I believe I examined you at Lancaster? - Yes.
There was no objection to your testimony? - No; I did it for the good of the public.
Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to abide by this, that that time was the only time you was tried here? - Yes.
Did you appear against these men, before there was an advertisement of a hundred pounds reward? - No, nor till after, till I found that if I had not appeared against them, they would have appeared against me; I bought the goods on the Sunday, and on the Saturday after I gave the information.

How long after the advertisement? - Four or five days after; I did not give the information particularly for the reward.
In your examination before the magistrate, did you say any thing of seeing M'Glew in Bray's house? - I believe I did.
Prisoner. He never did.
Court. How comes it, it is not here.
Prisoner Dawson. Did not you pay me for carrying it? - He came to me the Tuesday after, and asked me for payment; I told him I thought he was one of the persons concerned in it; he said he was not, and I gave him half a crown; I told Bray, and he said he had no right to ask me any thing about it, for he was his man.
Court. Did M'Glew take any part in the disposal of the lead? - I did not observe him take any part in the business.

             sworn.
I was met by Mr. Barew; he told me he was coming to look for me; he pulled out a little bit of black lead; that was Sunday morning, the 5th of March; he desired me to go with him; he asked me what I thought of it, and he told me if I would go along with him, he would give me half a guinea; we went to a public house, and had a quartern of gin; I said I could not say any thing to so small a sample; I went with him, and waited at the corner of a court in Holborn, and he brought me about half a pound in a paper; I said I should be glad to see it all; I went with him into a public house, and called for a pint of porter.
Who keeps that house? - I do not know; then he came and called me out, and I went along with him to the house of Mr. Bray; I believe it was his house; and there were all the prisoners, excepting M'Glew, I do not know them by name; there was M'Glew and Dawson I did not see; I am sure all the other prisoners were there, I am quite sure I saw them every one there; when I went from there, I went to a house up two pair of stairs.
Did you see Wilford the evidence there? - Yes, he was in the room, walking up and down the room; there lay half the lead in a basket, and half on the floor; Barew asked him what he would have for it; he asked him ten pounds for it, and he offered him four pounds; then Bray went below, and a woman that he calls his wife came up, with a key in her hand, and said the lads would not let him have the lead for any such money; he said she should go down again; he would not come out of the room till he came up again; accordingly, she went down, and Bray came up, and they agreed to give him four guineas and a half for it, and he gave him two guineas in my presence in the room, and when he gave him the money, we all went below.
Who was below stairs with you? - There was Mr. Barew, me, Mr. Bray, and the evidence, and all the five prisoners; he paid him the other two guineas below, and said he must owe him half a guinea; Barew and Bray went out of Bray's room, and while I was packing it up in handkerchiefs, Wilford said; I believe it was him, or one of them, said, d - n my body! here will be a go, if we are all to be hanged upon the new drop, for the value of four guineas and a half; while I was there, Wilford asked me what kind was the best; I told him it was a fine large sort, and shone like a looking-glass; and they said, d - n it, we will have some of it in the morning for you; in the morning, we called there; I carried part of it home in a basket; when we called the next morning, Bray and his wife were in bed, and we asked him if he had got any of the large, and he shewed us some from under the head of the bed, some in a cloth, and some in an apron, of the good sort, about forty pounds; on Monday I did not see any of the prisoners, but Bray and his wife in the morning.
Mr. Knowlys. You never saw M'Glew at Bray's house? - I never did.
(Some of the black-lead produced.)

             sworn.
I know Bray and M'Glew; they came once to my house, about eleven or twelve weeks past, to the best of my knowledge; I keep a coffee-house; they called for some coffee; Bray asked me whether I would buy some black-lead; he had a sample; I went with him to a house in Chick-lane, up an alley, into a garret; I cannot say whose house it was; I have been told it was M'Glew's, it is on the left side of a court in Chick-lane; I saw the lead in a sack, I told them to empty it into a flat basket, and I told them it would not suit me, it was not good enough; I wished them a good day; they told me they expected some more, they did not say when; on the morning following, about nine,

             came to me, with a basket on his shoulder; he came down into the kitchen; there were thirty-three pounds.
Prisoner Bray. I believe it was the witness's brother that carried it? - I saw Mr. Bray, nobody else; I did not see my brother; he asked me eight or nine shillings a pound, I gave him six shillings, there were thirty-three pounds of it; I have sold it to a person that is gone abroad; I shewed it in public sales, there is none of it here.
Court. What might you sell it at a pound? - I sold it at seven shillings and sixpence; I cannot say I ever had any acquaintance or dealings with Bray, I have seen him many times; I never saw M'Glew after the Sunday morning; I paid Bray for the thirty-three pounds, I paid him nine pounds.
Prisoner Bray. Are you to have any part of the hundred pounds reward? - I know nothing of reward; when I saw it in the papers, I immediately went to Bow-street.
Mr. Knowlys. Was there no reward in that advertisement? - I saw none if there was; I did not go up with that intention.
Where do you live? - In Brown's Buildings, No. 6.

             sworn.
I know Bray and M'Glew.
Do you remember seeing them at any time at Alexander's house? - Yes, on Sunday morning the 5th of March, about ten o'clock; they came together, Mr. Bray and Mr. M'Glew shewed Mr. Phillips a sample of black lead; he asked him if he had no more, he said, he had a parcel of it; he told him on the Monday morning to bring the whole; Phillips, M'Glew and Bray went away; on Monday morning Bray came with a basket, which was black lead, they agreed for the price together; it weighed thirty three pounds; I saw Phillips pay him at six shillings per pound, he asked nine shillings; and they agreed for six shillings.
Where do you live? - I am a tenant and boarder in my brother's house.
Prisoner M'Glew. Barew was the fellow that set me on to break the place open, he shewed me the place.

             sworn.
Mr. Fielding. Now young man, you are upon your oath, how many of these prisoners do you know? - Oliver, Griffiths, Baggally, and Browning; I was in company with them on the 4th of March, the Thursday night we went to Essex-street, in the Strand, we could not do any business; we had not tools enough; then on the Saturday night, we went and broke into the first warehouse, we all went together, the four prisoners and me, we took with us a thing, that we call a rook, that is an iron crow; we broke into the first warehouse, and we found nothing but old barrels; as we were groping about, we had no light to see, we found another door behind; we had no light at all; after we had broke open that door, they took four boxes and one barrel; Griffiths took the barrel, the other men took a box apiece; Oliver had an apartment at Bray's house, and he thought he had a great right to take it there; and he took it there, and put it out of the boxes into barrels, and put it into that bag; we thought it was not safe there, and I went over and asked one 
               
                  Poll
                   Williamson
               



             to let me put it in her two pair of stairs; she lived in George-alley, Field-lane, about the width of the court; she said, what is it? I said nothing that will affect her; she gave me the key; it was all put there on the Saturday night; then we went again on the next night, and found another barrel; we made a hole in the wall to make a purchase to get the door open, we had a light then, we took it with us in a lantern; we had been at work there two hours, or two hours and a half on the Sunday night, and we were obliged to break down the corner of the wall before we could get this purchase; we found nothing but barrels in that place; I took one and got away with it, and I heard an alarm of stop thief, and I went to the New-church, I fetched a coach and took the barrel to Bray's house; Griffiths had apartments there.
Prisoner Bray. Was I at home then Wilford? - No, I did not see you when I got there, they were there before me; Oliver said to me, that he had been boned.
What did he mean by that? - That he was taken; he said, there was a gentleman coming out of the place, and another at the door, and he escaped, and they took him in Essex-street; the others said, they were glad to see I had got away with it; then I saw Bray, he took some of it in a handkerchief.
Did you tell him how you came by it? - No, I went to the publick-house, he went somewhere else, he came back and asked me if I was willing to take five guineas and a half for it, I asked him if it was sold well, he said, he was no judge of it, I told him if he liked; and he gave me one guinea then, and the remainder the next day.
Was you to have the whole of it to your own benefit? - It was to be divided, Oliver and me being old friends, we kept a guinea apiece, and we divided the remainder between the other men and ourselves.
Did you see any thing of M'Glew? - I never saw him at all; I saw him when he went to Petticoat-lane; they did not tell me who it was sold to.
What did you see of Mr. Bray after this? - I was not present at any of the dealings with Barew.
Upon your oath were all those men with you on this transaction? - The four men that stand first at the bar, Oliver, Griffiths, Browning, and Baggally.
How long have you known Oliver? - Just before Christmas; I have not known any of the others long.
Who proposed this robbery? - A man we call Bowyer.
Bray. That is the brother-in-law of this Phillips.
Mr. Fielding. When did you go before Sir Sampson? - I do not know.
How long after the robbery was committed? - I was taken a week after the robbery was committed, and the next day I went before the Magistrate, on the Monday, then I came to Bow-street; about three or four days after I was taken for this affair.
What has happened between you and Oliver? - We were over the water, and Sir Sampson's men were after us, and a girl we call Black Poll, came and told us to make our escape; I said something, and Oliver made a reply d - n your blood do you speak against the girls, and he let fly at me with a horse pistol, and lodged one of the slugs in my head.
Was Bray at home at the time? - I did not see him.
Did you see M'Glew there? - I did not.
Did you see him in any part of the house where the goods were deposited? - No, Sir.

            'S DEFENCE.
May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am not the first unfortunate man whom the machinations of the witnesses who have appeared against me this day, have brought to this bar, and the ignominious situation in which I now stand; and if they have not in this instance, which is far from improbable, been the absolute projectors; they have in too many others, where they have derived the reward they have this day sought, been the first proposers of robberies, of which they have afterwards given circumstantial accounts in this Court, sacrificing the lives of their fellow creatures, either in purchasing the property they had instructed others to procure, or in causing them to be apprehended, which ever best answered their purpose of gain. The evidence 
               
                  Alexander
                   Phillipps
               



             is well known to every thief-taker in the kingdom, as a receiver of stolen goods, his family connections all center in the same point, and they have a regular chain for their business; they find out the places for depredation, afterwards become the purchasers of the plunder, and they make their appearance in this Court as evidence against a prisoner for the reward: his brother-in-law and in iniquity, the noted 
               
                  Hetsey
                   Lee
               



            , was apprehended for the Great Seal of England, and conviction would have followed, had not the woman who first gave the information been bought off. In fact, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, this very evidence Phillipps, and his connections, could give account of most of the robberies which are committed, and the only reason they do not appear where great rewards are offered is, because they have made considerable more by purchasing of it. The witness Barrew is a man of the same description, and has in this Court been the frequent subject of the severest reprehensions, and the object of condign punishment; and had not the mercy of the law been extended towards him, by admitting him an evidence for the Crown, in a mail robbery two years ago, he would not have wanted what he hopes to derive from my conviction, for he must have met that fate he has involved on many unfortunate men. God forbid that your Lordship, or the Gentlemen of the Jury should receive the testimony of such men, as ye would that of those standing before you, actuated by no mercenary view, but inspired with a laudable zeal for the administration of justice, with that benevolent commiseration a good a man will always feel for an unhappy fellow creature; but I humbly trust in the justice and humanity of this honourable Court, that their scheme to injure me will upon this occasion prove abortive; for I humbly hope that where there are no solid proofs to establish my guilt, you will not pronounce it; and that therefore in this, as well as in every other circumstance of surmise or conjecture; it will be deemed as just and charitable to suppose for, as to suppose against a prisoner: and I trust too, that though a man may be unfortunate enough to have a blemished character, this Court will not allow that he shall be made responsible for offences he never committed; or that a surmise or supposition will be sufficient to supply the place of a chair convincing proof. My being in possession of a sample so immediately after the commission of the burglary may superficially appear a proof I knew in what manner it was procured; but, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, when you consider, that it is very natural for men, who have procured property dishonestly, to dispose of it as soon as they can, you will not wonder that so immediate an application was made; I was employed in the business merely to procure a purchaser, and the evidence Barrew can confirm this, for I acquainted him so at our first interview on the Sunday morning: it is true, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I may merit censure for not enquiring how it was procured; but I hope the want of prudence will not justify the charge of criminality. When Barrew called on Sunday morning with his friend, he desired to see the whole quantity, as he could better determine, he said, than from a parcel which might have been partially selected; it was shewn him, and in the true spirit of his profession, he offered four guineas, for what I had been instructed to ask ten; and to this I humbly beg to call the particular attention of your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, as it carries its own comment. Had Barrew, (whatever he may now insinuate) believed, and he has a very great experimental knowledge in that kind of business, that I knew how the lead was procured, he would have treated with me as a principal; but another circumstance my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, which I have to state, will still strengthen, I trust, the solemn assertion I now make, that I did not know how it was procured, and am consequently innocent of the charge of which I now stand indicted; which is, that when the Crown evidence, Wilford, and the prisoner Oliver indicted for the burglary, were informed what Barew offered, they appeared dissatisfied, and went to him, they concluded the bargain; I was not present, and Barrew took away the lead; but had I been an accomplice in the burglary, I should, as I before observed, have treated with Barrew as a principal; I must observe to your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, that Oliver and Wilford slept in a house, rented by a woman, with whom I have some time cohabited.
On the Monday morning, Wilford acquainted me that he had brought some more lead, and requested, that should Barrew call, I would shew it him, and ask en guineas; Barrew did call, and I complied with Wilford's request; he offered four guineas; I told him, as I had the preceding day, that it was no property of mine, that the price fixed was ten guineas, and I could say nothing to any other proposal; Wilford some little time after took away the lead, and I heard no more of the unfortunate transaction until I was apprehended. The witness who has been considered competent to appear in evidence against one man, will not I humbly trust be rejected, when his testimony may be favourable to another, and I therefore hope your Lordship will seek the corroboration of Wilford, to any part he can confirm.
I have now to return my thanks for the very indulgent patience with which the Court has heard my defence; a defence which I trust will secure to me that verdict, which my own heart tells me I deserve: for I am persuaded your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, will, when you are considering my case, not forget the characters of those who have appeared against me; and finding their money-interested testimony unsupported by creditable and positive corroboration, not give spirit or encouragement to such nefarious plans, in future, by throwing the reward into their pockets, at the expence of sacrificing an innocent man to the vengeance of the law.
Mr. Knowlys. I was going to submit to your Lordship that there is nothing to call M'Glew on his defence; at the time when this was deposited, it was deposited in the house where these persons lived.
Court. I do not think I should call on M'Glew for his defence.

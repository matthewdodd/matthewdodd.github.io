            . On the 5th of August I was in the counting-house, behind my warehouse; I saw this person come in and take my hat - I ran out and overtook him at the corner of Jermyn-street, only three doors off, walking quietly with it; I wrenched it from him - he appeared to be concealing it.
Prisoner's Defence. A man ran briskly by me, and dropped this hat - I took it up, and the gentleman came and took me.

            . He did not say so at the time; I am certain he is the person who took it - he begged to be let go; it was about two o'clock in the day - I never lost sight of him.

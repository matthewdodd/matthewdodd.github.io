            , my master's nephew brought me two one pound notes; when he pulled them out, the prisoner rushed between us and snatched them out of his hand, at one snatch; I ran and caught him by the collar; he immediately dropped them; the boy picked them up, and said John, there is one torn almost to pieces; I said to the prisoner, I insist upon your making that note good; he said, if I would go to his master he would make it good; I went with the prisoner and his companions down Camomile-street; when I got to the bottom, into St. Mary-Axe, I met 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Mayo
               



            , who said, John, where are you going, I said, I am going to this man's master, and he went with us.
Q. Who had the notes? - A. The boy took them home to his uncle; next morning I had them from the boy; the prisoner took us into an alley, called Still-alley, across Houndsditch; he went first, I followed him, Mayo followed me, and the prisoner's companions followed him; a little way up the alley there is a turning to the right band; at the second door he knocked two or three times: there he turned himself round on his heel, 
               drew
             a knife, or some sharp cutting instrument from the sleeve of his coat; and upon seeing that, I said to 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Mayo
               



            , there is a knife; I dropped back a little, and the prisoner instantly struck the knife through Mayo's cheek, into his mouth; the prisoner said, there, you b-y b-r, that's my master, meaning his knife; his companions immediately knocked me down with a large stick, or butt end of a whip, and beat me mery much; in that time Mayo and the prisoner had a scuffle, the prisoner's companion, to assist him, jumped over me as I lay on the ground; I endeavoured to get up, as I was rising up on my hands and knees, the prisoner slipped on one side, and stabbed me on the left side of the back; I dropped, and then the prisoner and his companion made their escape; there are the cloaths I was stabbed in.(Produces coat, waistcoat, and shirt).
Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. What time was this? - A. About five or six o'clock.
Q. How many people were there beside you? - A. There was the boy and me, the prisoner, his two companions, and a woman who sold fruit.

Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. Not to my knowledge; I never saw him again till the 16th of December, from the 22d of September, at Bow-street, with three other prisoners; I knew him directly.
Q. Have you not got a detainer against the prisoner of the assault? - A. Yes.
Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes, perfectly, for I did not leave work till between four and five o'clock.
BENJAMIN MAYO sworn. - I lived at No. 77, Sun-street, at that time; I met John Heseltine, and asked him what was the matter; the prisoner was with him; he said the prisoner had robbed the boy of two one pound notes, and one of them was torn very much, and the prisoner said, if he would go with him to his master, he would give him another for it; he took us into a place called Stillalley, and went to a door and tapped with his left hand; then he turned himself round and drew something out, and said, you b-y b-r that is my master, and stuck me right through the mouth; after he had stabbed me, and we had some scuffling, he stabbed Heseltine; after that I made my escape, and cried out murder; we were taken to the doctor, and the prisoner escaped, as nobody would go after them; the prisoner's companion beat us a good deal with a stick; I never saw the prisoner till at Bow-street; there were four taken up on suspicion.
Q. You met Heseltine and the prisoner walking along, but nobody else? - A. Yes, another man, and I understood there was another at first, but I did not see him.

Court. (To Heseltine.) Q. You had not the torn note to give in return for another, had you? A. No, the boy had it, waiting for my return, and I did not have it that night, because I went to the surgeons.

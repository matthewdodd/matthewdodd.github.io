            . The prisoner was my servant
; I saw the cloak the day before she went away; the morning after she went I missed it; I went to a public house in Tyburn-road, where she lived a servant; her mistress brought it down into the tap room.

Prisoner's Defence.
I lived servant there two days; she was very jealous of me, and turned me away at twelve o'clock at night; I went the next night for my things; he gave me the bundle; when I opened it I found the cloak and sheet in it; I was afraid to carry them back; I do not know how they came in the bundle.

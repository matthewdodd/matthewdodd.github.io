GEORGE RICE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of March, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Harrison Thompson, from his person.






ROBERT TYRRELL
. I am an officer of the Post Office. On the 2nd of March, about ten minutes after six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty, and observed the prisoner very busy among the gentlemen, who were paying letters—there was an immense crowd—I saw the prisoner had no letter, and watched him—I saw him take the gentleman's coat flap up, and take the handkerchief out—I took it out of his hand before he could dispose of it—I searched him, and found two silk handkerchiefs on him—I asked him if they were marked—he said, "No"—I found one was marked—MR. Thompson claimed the one I saw him take—I asked him where he lived—he said, "No. 1, Nottingham-court, King-street, Long Acre," and worked with his father, who was a shoemaker, but in his pocket I found a card, with "John Kittle, Newspaper Agent, High Holborn," on it—I went there, and found he had gone into that employ that very day—he had been sent with newspapers to the Office, and his master was surprised he had not returned.

Prisoner. The handkerchief was hanging out of the gentleman's pocket. Witness. It was not—it was an inside pocket he had—he said he had brought a letter to the post wrapped up in one of the handkerchiefs.





HARRISON THOMPSON
. I live in St. Paul's Church-yard—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it)—I lost it that evening.

Prisoner. His pocket was ripped right open, and the handkerchief was out. Witness. My pocket was torn a little across.

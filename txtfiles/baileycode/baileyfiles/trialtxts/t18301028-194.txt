MARY ANN ELLIS. I am the wife of 
               
                  George 
                  Robert Ellis
               



            . I took out my daughter Rosina on the 30th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning; she had the necklace on - I had been out about a quarter of an hour, when the necklace was taken off her neck; I did not see it taken, but she said, "Mother, somebody has taken my necklace;" I turned, and saw the prisoner with it in his hand - another boy was with him; I went up and told the prisoner he had my child
's necklace - he said, "Search me," and the moment he said that he ran up Drury-lane, but was taken - I lost sight of him, and do not know what became of the necklace, but I am quite positive I saw it in his hand - I have not the least doubt it was my child's necklace; I had put it on her neck the moment before I went out - it was three rows of coral.
Prisoner's Defence. She never saw any necklace in my hand.

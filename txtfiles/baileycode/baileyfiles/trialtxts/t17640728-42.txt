            . On the 21st of June I had a warrant granted me against the prisoner, for taking a watch away, the property of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Flaharty 
               



            ; he denied having any watch about him, both before and at Justice Welch's: Mr. Welch ordered me to search him, and I found this watch under his armpit (producing a silver watch); the man that lost the watch is now in Newgate, for receiving stolen goods, and cast for transportation for fourteen years.

             Allen. This is Mr. Flaharty's property: in May 1763, I cleaned and mended it for him, and had four shillings for doing it: when he had lost it he came and told me of it; the constable had him in custody at the same time: this was about five weeks ago.

I had the watch, the night before this gentleman lays he took me, of a seaman that came from Vortsmouth; I lent him a guinea upon it: after that, Flaharty came to my shop, and said I had robbed him of his watch.

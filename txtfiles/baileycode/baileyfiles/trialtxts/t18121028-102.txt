            . I am a musical instrument maker
. I live in Ratcliffe-street


. The prisoner was employed by me on the 23d of September, as a charwoman
. I had laid out the articles in the indictment for the purpose of changing my dress; and when I wanted to go out I found the things were gone. I applied to an officer. He took the prisoner with the things on her.

            . In consequence of Mr. Haines calling upon me, I apprehended the prisoner in a public-house in Parson's-street with this bundle with her.
Prosecutor. They are my property.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going by the prosecutor's door. He asked me how I did. I answered him. He said, come in, I have something particular to say to you; and when I went in he shut the door, and locked it. He forced me up stairs, threw me on the bed, and did as he thought proper. He gave me these things. He said he had no money.
Prosecutor. That defence is an abominable falsehood.

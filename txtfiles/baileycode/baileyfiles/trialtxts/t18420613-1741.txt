JOHN WHITE
 was indicted

 for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 




Thomas Groom, on the 
16th of May, at 
St. Giles-in-the—Fields, and stealing therein 1 coat, value 15s.; 1 waistcoat, value 4s.; 1 pair of trowsers, value 9s.; 1 pair of boots, value 3s.; 3 gowns, value 1l. 10s.; and 1 apron, value 1d.; his property.






THOMAS GROOM
. I live in Belton-street, Long-acre, in the parish of St. Giles, and am a shoemaker. I occupy the ground-floor, and pay rent to Mr. Lucas, who does not occupy the house himself—it is let out in tenements—the street-door is left open for the lodgers—on the 16th of May, I went out about half-past eight or a quarter before nine o'clock—I locked my room door, and put a brad-awl into the back parlour window—the back parlour door was bolted inside—I was fetched home from my club-house, found the parlour door unbolted, and the window undone—I missed the articles produced, which were in my drawers when I left—I have seen the prisoner a hundred times before—he has been on the second-floor of my house many times, and was well acquainted with it.





SUSAN GROOM
. I am the prosecutor's wife. I came home about ten minutes to eight o'clock, and found the back parlour door on the latch—it must have been opened from within—I saw the brad-awl on the floor which had been in the window—I missed these articles, which I had seen safe when I went out.





GEORGE JOHN RESTEAUX
. I am a policeman. On the 16th of May, I met the prisoner in Wooburn-street, with these articles tied in a bundle—he said he had brought them from St. Luke's, and was going to take them to Paddington to his sister—he afterwards said be bought the coat, waistcoat, trowsers, and boots in Monmouth-street—I took him there—he pointed to a shop, and the man said he had never seen him before. 


GUILTY.* Aged 20.—



Transported for Ten Years.

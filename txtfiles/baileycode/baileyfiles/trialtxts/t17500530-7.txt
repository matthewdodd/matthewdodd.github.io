            , he has got a handkerchief in his hand, which he was going to drop. He had not ran above eight or ten yards before he was taken. I took the handkerchief out of his hand, and found it to be my own. The excuse he made, was, he took it up.
Q. When had you your handkerchief last, before you lost it?
Price. I had it when I was at Holbourn-bridge, in my left side pocket, and this was before we came to the four lamps.
Prisoner's defence. As I was coming home, I saw a mob, I cross'd over the way, this man came over the way and said, I have lost my handkerchief. He could not find any thing about me, the handkerchief was lying by a post.
Prosecutor. I took it out of his hand.

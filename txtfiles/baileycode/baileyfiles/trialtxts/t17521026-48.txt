            . On Thursday the 21st of September, about nine at night, I and my sister Sarah were stopped by the prisoner in Grosvenor Street
. He said, Ladies, deliver your money, or I'll blow your brains out. He had a stick in his hand, but did not hold it up. My sister ran down street, and called out for help. Then the prisoner said as before, and put his hand to his pocket. I told him I would deliver my money presently, and immediately called out, Murder and thieves! He ran away, and I after him, calling out as I ran.

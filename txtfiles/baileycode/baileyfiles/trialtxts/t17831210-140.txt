On the 21st of November, I was within Guildhall


, seeing the lottery drawn, I saw the prisoner there, I put my hand into my pocket and missed my handkerchief, he was near me, and just before that I saw a paper drop, which I knew was mine, I then saw the prisoner go under the bar in a great hurry, I followed him, he went under Blackwell-hall, he went out of the great door, he went as fast as he could for the croud, he went into Cateaton-street, there was nobody particular in a Basinghall-street, and I did not like to go to him myself, I wished to know where he went to in Cateaton-street, and I saw a man named Buckero, and I told him, and he pursued him, the prisoner had his hand in his pocket, he would not take it out, this Buckero then put his hand in the prisoner's pocket and pulled out my handkerchief, my name was marked on it.

I joined in pursuit of the prisoner, he had his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and he would not take it out, I put my hand in and pulled out the handkerchief.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord, I could not get any work, and I happened to go into Guildhall, and I saw this handkerchief lay down, and I took it up, and the man took me.

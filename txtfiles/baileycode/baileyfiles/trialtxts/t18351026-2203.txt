 for that he, on the 
7th of October, at 
St. Catherine Cree Church, otherwise Christchurch, feloniously did forge a certain request for the delivery of a hat, with intent to defraud 



Thomas Frederick Salter.—2nd COUNT, for uttering, disposing of, and putting off the same, well knowing it to be forged.







GEORGE SIMMONS
. I am a furrier, and live in Langley-place, Commercial-road; the prisoner is a nephew of my wife. I never sent him to Mr. Salter's for a hat—I never gave him a written order for one—I have an account with Salter—this order is not in my hand-writing.

Prisoner. Q. Is it my writing? A. I cannot tell.





JOSEPH COTTON
. I am shopman to Thomas Frederick Salter, a hatter, in Aldgate. On the 7th of October the prisoner came to the shop with this order, and I let him have the hat in consequence of that order—I deals with Mr. Simmons.





SUSAN SALTER
. I remember the prisoner coming to the shop the first time—he said he wished to have a hat on account of Mr. Salter—I said we could not let him have it unless he brought an order from Mr. Salter—he said he did not know that was required, and he would bring one—he returned in three-quarters of an hour, with the order.





GEORGE TEAKLE
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and received the order.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

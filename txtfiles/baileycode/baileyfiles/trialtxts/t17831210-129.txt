                  SOPHIA
                   WATTS
               



             sworn.
I lost this silver cream pot on Wednesday last, I live in Little Chapel-street, Soho



; I had a chimney sweeper
 about one o'clock, and after he was gone, when we went to tea, we missed the milk pot.
Is the prisoner one of them that swept your chimney that day? - Yes.

                   WOOTTEN
               



             sworn.
I live with Mrs. Watts, her kitchen chimney was swept last Wednesday, the prisoner was one of the sweepers, there were two more, another boy and a man, this boy's master; I saw the cream pot in the morning: I missed it at five, I set the tea things and I could not find the milk pot, and I am very sure that nobody, but Mrs. Watts and myself had been in the kitchen, I went to seek for the chimney sweeper, and I found him, and we found Wells, and he was searched, nothing was found on him, he would not own it, and his master said, he knew a place where he used to take things, and he took us to the prisoner Smith's house, and she disowned it at first, that she had ever seen the boy, she keeps a shop: then one of her lodgers sat by the fire, and she told her to go and fetch it, and the constable and the prosecutor went to the pawnbroker's: The pawnbroker has it here.
Mr. Sylvester, Council for the Prisoner Smith. Who is Mrs. Watts? - A widow.
You know nothing of the boy? - No, only from the report of the master.

                   BROWN
               



             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker, I took in this milk pot December the 10th, about three or four o'clock, of one 
               
                  Mary
                   Wayland
               



            , she said, she brought it for her landlady, but I took it in her own name, that is in the name of Wagan, she said her landlady was one Mrs. Smith, I lent her thirteen shillings on it.
MARY WAYLAND sworn.
I lodge at the prisoner, Smith's, she is a very honest woman, and keeps a regular house, and she called me down stairs out of my room, and she said I want a little money, go and leave this where it will be safe, and get me a duplicate, she is as honest a woman as ever I live with.
Did she say whose it was? - No.
You have lodged so long in her house, did you ever see such a thing in her house? - Never, but she might have more value than that, she is a decent housekeeper, Sir.
Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, I submit to the Court that here is no evidence against the principal, and therefore none against the receiver.
Prisoner's Council to Mr. Wayland. This was given to you publickly? - In her own passage.
No desire to conceal it at all? - No, none at all.
She is a very honest woman? - Yes.
PRISONER SMITH's DEFENCE.
That is the woman that this lad gave the milk pot to; ask the lad.
Wayland. I never saw the lad till I saw him that night.

                   ROBINS
               



             sworn.
I am a bricklayer, I live in Gray's-inn-lane, I know the prisoner Smith, her husband is a labourer, I have known her about three years, they are tenants to me, and if I had not a good character of them, I would not have let them my house.
Has she any children? - She has had children, but I believe she has none now.
Jury to Brown. Is not it customary with people to pledge goods in different names? - Yes they do, but we do not know of any other name that she had.
Court to Jury. I think 
               
                  Mary
                   Wayland
               



             stands in some degree in a suspicious situation; and this evidence is defective, though there is evidence to come home to the receiver, her sending this woman to pawn this cream-pot which she must know was not her's; yet by law she cannot be convicted as the receiver, unless we can convict the principal, and against him there is no evidence at all, only that he was seen in the house with another boy and his master; it is very slight evidence, but I shall leave it to you.

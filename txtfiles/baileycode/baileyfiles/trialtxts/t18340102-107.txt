 - I did not see the prisoner till he was at the office, but I lost this coat, on the 26th of December, from a trunk in my shop - I had seen it safe between nine and ten o'clock.
JAMES SMITH. I am a chimney-sweeper, and have known the prisoner about eight years - on the 26th of December I saw him - he said he was going to get a shilling for a Christmas-box - he went to the prosecutor's, and told me to wait round the corner - he came with the coat, and said it was given to him for a Christmas-box; and by his coming so boldly with it, I really thought it was so - he said if I would go with him, he would try and sell it, and give me something to drink, but he left me soon after without selling it.
JURY. Q.Have you not been tried lately? A. Yes: on account of the prisoner's putting some sacks in my cellar.

            . I have known the prisoner for eight years - he asked me to pawn the coat for him, and I did.

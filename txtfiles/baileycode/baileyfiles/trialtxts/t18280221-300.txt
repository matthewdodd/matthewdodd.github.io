            . I am the daughter of John Osborne, of No. 4, St. Dunstan's-passage, Tower-street


. The prisoner was in our service - she was leaving on the 27th of January, and we missed this property; I sent for an officer, who searched her, and found the duplicates on her; he went and got the articles - one petticoat was found on her person.

            . I am a dress-maker. On the Friday before, the prisoner brought this cotton to our house, and said she had got some stuff to make a gown; she left it with me, called again, and said she had not time to tell me how to make it, but would call again; the officer afterwards called, and I gave it to him.

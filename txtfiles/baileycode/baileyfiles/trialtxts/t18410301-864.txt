MARY GOULDING
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of February, I kettle, value 1s.; 1 saucepan, value 1s.; 1 bonnet, value 1s.; and 1 cap, value 6d.; the goods of 



Rebecca Elvigeh: and that she had been before convicted of felony.






REBECCA ELVIGEH
. I am an unfortunate girl—I live at Mrs. Neal's in Church-lane—I hired a room there which I left with my property in it, padlocked up, on the 5th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, and returned in half an hour—I found my door broken open—I missed seven pictures, some toys, and other things—on the 9th my door was broken again in the same way; I missed my bonnet, cap, kettle, and saucepan—I know the prisoner, she is unfortunate, like me—this is the bonnet and cap—the other things I have not seen since.





JOHN O'BRIEN
. I live in Monmouth-court. The prisoner, who is a relation of my wife's, brought this bonnet to my house, and asked to leave it there for a while—the prosecutrix came and claimed it.





JOHN JAMES ALLEN
 (police-constable E 159.) I went with the prosecutrix, and found the pictures, which the prosecutrix identified, under the prisoner's bed.

Prisoner. The prosecutrix had been drinking with me all day—there was another person at the door with O'Brien when I went there—the prosecutrix's door was broken by some policeman to take her for bad money, and she gave me the bonnet into my hand.





REBECCA ELVIGEH

re-examined. I did not—I was not out on either of the days till I went out at night—I never drank with her in my life—. I live in the parish of St. Giles.





CHARLES COOPER
. I have been a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she was sentenced to be transported for seven years—I was a witness, and know she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . I and my wife sell fruit
, the prisoner was in distress; we let her lie in our room out of pity, and she lay there from Tuesday till Saturday, in which time she took a gold ring and 7 s. in money out of our room.
Q. How do you know that?
Murphy. Because they were found in her custody.
Q. From whence did you lose them ?
Murphy. They were taken from out of a little box in the window; the governor of the workhouse of St. George's parish caused her to be taken up.
Q. Did any body else lie in that room?
Murphy. No one but I and my wife, and a little child of about eleven years of age. I swore to the ring before the justice.


                  John 
                  Lewis 
               



            . I was sent for after the prisoner was apprehended, being one of the beadles of the parish; I took charge of her, and asked her some questions about the ring and money; she took out a ring from her pocket, and gave it to me, and said she had spent part of the money.
Q. Did she own she had taken the ring and money?
Lewis. Yes, she did. (The ring produced.)
Q. to prosecutrix. Look at this ring?
Prosecutrix. This is the same ring I lost, it is my property.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

BENJAMIN THOMAS CARTWRIGIIT
. I am porter in the service of William Bennett and Mr. Brown, wholesale tea-dealers, in King William-street. On the 13th of July I had two chests of tea, a box, and a bag, to take to the Saracen's Head, Aldgate, in a truck—when I got near Aldgate pump I found the truck swerve round—I turned my head, and saw the prisoner at the tail of the truck, with the coffee in his hands—I pursued him down Leadenhall-street, calling "Stop thief"—I was close at his heels, and he threw the coffee into the road—I collared him in Black Raven-court, and gave him in charge to a policeman—I never lost sight of him.





WILLIAM SHEPPERSON
 (City police-constable No. 614.) I was on duty in Leadenhall-street—I saw the prisoner throw away the bag, and run up Black Raven-court, which is no thoroughfare—when I came up, Cartwrigbt had him by the jacket—I took him into custody, and received the bag of coffee.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Leadenhall-street; there was a mob running; they hallooed out "Stop thief," and I ran as well as others; that is all I know about it; the man collared me.





WILLIAM CARR
 (police-constable H 109.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from the Clerk of this Court—I was present as a witness on the prisoner's former trial, and am certain he is the person mentioned in this certificate—(read.)




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

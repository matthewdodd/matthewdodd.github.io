, and went out on the 22nd of March, at half-past five o'clock in the evening - I did not return till half-past twelve; I then missed these things, and the prisoner was gone - I have seen the caddy at a pawnbroker's, but he is not here - it is my property; I did not see the prisoner again till she was taken up.
JOHN RADFORD. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner, and found on her the duplicate of the caddy - this petticoat was in pawn; I found this caddy-spoon and these ornaments, which had been in the caddy.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. She lent them to me. Witness. No, never.
RICHARD SNELLGROVE. I have a certificate of the conviction of the prisoner in April, 1829; I was present, and know she is the person - she was found guilty, and was confined for two months in the House of Correction.

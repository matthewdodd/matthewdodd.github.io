MARY ANNE PRATT
. I am the wife of William Pratt, a shoemaker, of Caroline-place, Somers' Town. On the 27th of January the prisoner came and asked my husband to give him work as a boy—my husband said he could not take him on boy's wages, as he could not live on that—he said he was starving—we gave him victuals for three days, and gave him 1s. 2d., and kept him till the Sunday evening—he then said he was

going to chapel, and went away—I had seen the shirt and pinafore that afternoon—here is part of the property—these other things were missing also—this is a child's frock—no one else had the opportunity of taking it.

Prisoner. There was a woman sitting by your side. Witness. Yes; he pretended to us that he was a Methodist, and my husband said if he had never disgraced them, we would send for a woman to come and write a letter for him, and that woman came to write it, but she never crossed the room.





JOHN ANDREW SIMPSON
. I am foreman to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker. I took this frock of the prisoner, on the 30th of January for 3d.—it may be worth 9d.





THOMAS NICKLIN
 (police-constable S 163.) I took the prisoner, and have two duplicates—one of them is for this frock—he said he lived at No. 4, Monmouth-strect—I went there, and he did not live there—I got the duplicate from another officer, who is not here.

Prisoner. I did not pledge it. I am innocent—he has taken a false oath.




GUILTY
.† Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

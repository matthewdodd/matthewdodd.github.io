CHARLES MANSELL.
I serve in the shop of Henry Wingrove, and another, linen-drapers, at Hammersmith. On the 29th of May, the prisoners came in company for some calico—the foreman served them—I was present, and watched them—they bought the calico—I saw Kent take the gloves off the counter—Francis stood close by the side of her—Kent put the gloves into her bosom, and then they both walked away—I had been serving Francis with some hooks and eyes—they were followed and taken—these are the gloves—(looking at them)—I saw Kent showing Francis the gloves outside the door, and she wrapped them up in her own parcel, and gave them to Francis.





THOMAS BUCK
(police-constable T32.) I took the prisoners, and found the gloves in Francis's bosom.

Kent's Defence. I had left a parcel on the counter; I was going back, and gave my parcel to Francis to hold, and then they took me.





JOHN JONES
(police-constable F31.) I produce a certificate of Kent's former conviction, which I got from the clerk of the Peace Office for Westminster—I was in the Court—the prisoner is the person—(read)—she has been three times convicted before, and three times since—she was only out of prison six days before she did this.

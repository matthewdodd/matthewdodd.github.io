THOMAS ROSS
 was indicted

 for embezzling 8s. 2d.; and that be he had been before convicted of felony.






HENNRY JOHN LEGG
. I am a shoemaker; the prisoner was in my service. On the 24th of Oct. I sent him with fourteen pairs of shoes to Mr. Thoma's, in Cheapside—he was to receive 8s. 2d., which he ought to have brought back, and other materials—if he received that money, he did not return.

Prisoner. I never saw you before in my life. Witness. Yes, you did—they were fourteen pair of back-strap shoes, six by nine—the prisoner had been with me a few days over a fortnight—I am positive he is the person.





JOHN STANCOMB
. I am foreman to Mr. Thomas. The prisoner brought fourteen pairs of shoes on the 24th of last month—I gave him 8s. 2d., and a dozen pairs of work for his master to manufacture.

Prisoner. Q. Do you know what they were? A. Some were grained patent, and some grey—you gave in fourteen pairs of shoes, and I recollect they were all back-straps.

Prisoner. All I have to say is, that the prosecutor is as false a swearing man as ever swore in his life, and it is a pity such a man should be allowed to take an oath.





THOMAS BALDWIN
 (police-sergeant L 13.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

, stealing 1 cash-box, 1 brooch, 3 rings, 4 purses, and other articles, value 2l.; and 2 sovereigns, the property of

St. Giles'-in-the-Fields.






THOMAS BURDEN.
 I live at Store-street, Bedford-square, in the parish of St. Giles'-in-the-Fields. On Friday evening, 10th March, I was in the passage, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a cash-box under his arm—I did not know him before, and asked where he had been—he said he had been to see Mistress.—, but could say no more—he dropped the box, and tried to get away—I secured him, and sent for a policeman—he went down or his knees, and begged me to forgive him—I gave him in charge—I saw the box opened at the station—it contained purses, rings, and 2l. 9s. 10d. in cash—this is it—(produced.)

Prisoner. Q. Did not I tell you a gentleman gave it me in the first floor? A. No.





ELIZABETH BURDEN.
 I live with my brother. This box, and contents are mine—it is worth 8l. at least—it was kept on the dressing-table in the second floor bed-room—the door was not locked—there was nobody up stairs.

Prisoner. Q. Were you up stairs? A. was in the parlour, heard a noise, came out, and saw you on your knees—you only asked for mercy—you said nothing about a gentleman.





WILLIAM DIXON
 (policeman.) I was called to Mr. Burden's—the prisoner was given into my charge, and the box—he tried to get away.

Prisoner's Defence. I had not left work a quarter of an hour; a man,

standing at the door, asked me to carry a box; I said, "Yes," and he took me to the second floor, gave it me, and said, "If you see my brother down stairs, go on."




GUILTY. Aged 19.—

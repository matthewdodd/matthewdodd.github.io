ROGER HUNT. I am a clerk in the office of the Bank Solicitor
. I was on Ludgate-hill


 on the 9th of November; there was no procession passing then; my handkerchief was in my left-hand coat-pocket; I heard a sudden scuffle behind me; I turned round, and saw the officer holding Croker by the collar: he had my handkerchief in his hand; I then missed it from my pocket: - I saw Guppy at a short distance - he stood for a moment, and then ran down the hill.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was coming up Ludgate-hill - I saw the two prisoners and another following two gentlemen very closely; I then saw Guppy take Mr. Hunt's handkerchief and give it to Croker. I ran and took Guppy.

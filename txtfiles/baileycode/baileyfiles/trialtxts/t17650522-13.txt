            . I live in Great Newport-street


, and am a silversmith
; on the 8th of May, about 5 or 6 in the evening; I was in my workshop below stairs; my mother was in the shop above; she knocked for me to come up, I sent my boy up; he came down and said the prisoner was above, and asked to see a pair of stone buttons, which he had seen a day or two before: I went up; he had them in his hand; I asked him half a crown; he said he would give me two shillings. as he was standing there he put his hand to the drawer and took out this blank seal and a pair of silver clasps. I observed the seal to shine between his fingers; I opened his hand and took them out of the palm of his hand. (Produced and deposed to.)When I saw the things, I said, Have you a mind to rob me? he said, in broken English I a rogue! I punish you, you call me a rogue; and denied having any thing at first.

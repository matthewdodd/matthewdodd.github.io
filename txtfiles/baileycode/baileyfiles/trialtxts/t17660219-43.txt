            . Last Sunday night I met the prisoner within two fields of Stepney, he past me, and in about two or three minutes he came upon me, and struck me with this bludgeon (producing a trunnel) and demanded my money; I begged for God's sake he would not use me ill, and said I had but a halfpenny in the world; he saw two men coming, he left me, they and I followed and took him, he fell down on his knees, and begged to be let go.

            , the two persons that were at the securing him, were in court, but it was thought needless to call them.
Prisoner's defence.
I had no victuals all the day. I met some shipmates of mine at Stepney, they gave me part of four tankards of beer; I went to get a turnep to eat, and I ran against this man; said I, have you got any money. I did not knock him down.

, Plumbtree-street, St. Giles's


. On the 5th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoners by the shop - the beef was on the shopboard - somebody said, it was gone, and pointed to where they were gone. I went round, and met Herring in about five minutes, with the beef. I laid hold of him - then Newman, who was with him, ran away, and was taken in a few days. I am sure he is the boy.

1193. 




SARAH ANN ADAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 half-crowns the monies of 



William White, from his person.






WILLIAM WHITE
. I am a shipwright. On the 20th of April I was at a public-house in Woolwich—the prisoner was by my side—I had 10s., when I went in—I sat there, and had two or three pints of beer—I did not know what I did altogether, but a gentleman called me out, and asked if I had been robbed—I found I had lost two half-crowns from my right band pocket.

Prisoner. At the Duke on Horseback you gave me two half-crowns to go with you. Witness. I did not.





JOHN M'DONALD
. I was at the Duke on Horseback, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 20th of April—I saw the prisoner come in with the prosecutor—she asked him for 1s., which he gave her, and no sooner bad he done that than she put her hand into his right hand pocket, and took out two half-crowns, put them to her hair, and then put then into her mouth—I went to her, and said, "Do you chew tobacco?"—she said "Yes"—I said, "You had better put that quid out of your mouth"—she went out—I followed, and gave her in charge.





JOHN WALLEN
 (police-constable R 298.) I took the prisoner—she denied having any money, and all knowledge of it—I took her hand, and had a violent struggle with her—I at last got two half-crowns from her.

Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the 5s.; M'Donald wanted me to give half a crown to spend, and I would not.




GUILTY
.** Aged 28.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(John Wallen stated that the prisoner had been thirty-two times in custody.)

Before Mr. Recorder.

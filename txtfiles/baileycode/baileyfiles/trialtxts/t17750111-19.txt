            . I keep a sale-shop
 in Barbican


. The two prisoners came to my shop on the 15th of December: as soon as they were gone out of the shop, my wife told me they had stole a cloak that hung up at the door; we brought them back, I charged them with stealing the cloak:

             confessed
"she
"had taken the cloak, she said, it was her first
"fact, and she would give me a shilling to
"drink, if I would let her go." The constable did not come for a long time; before he came we found the cloak thrown over the counter.
Edanor Freer confirmed her husband's evidence.
The prisoner denied the charge, but called no witnesses.

JAMES HUNT. I am in the employ of William Henry Ablett, hosier and glover
, Fish-street-hill. I had master's coat in a bundle on the 1st of June, to take to Mr. Green, a tailor, in Frith-street, Soho; as I was crossing the Strand


, to go up Southampton-street, I saw the prisoner, who snatched it from me; I called Stop thief! and he was taken; I saw him throw it away - he was quite a stranger but I am quite certain of his person.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a glass-cutter. I was coming out of Maiden-lane and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running - I crossed the road and stopped him, in company with two more; he threw the bundle over his head, quite across the street, and it fell into the kennel. I am certain he is the man.

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner and bundle were delivered to me.

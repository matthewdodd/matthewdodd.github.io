. On the 11th of November, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock in the morning, this cotton stood on a stool inside the door; a boy informed me a man had stolen it; I missed it, went out, and found the prisoner, about a hundred yards off, with a bundle under his arm. I secured him in Drury-lane with it.

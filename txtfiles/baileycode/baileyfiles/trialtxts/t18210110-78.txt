            . On the 27th of December, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Princes-street, Leicester-square


, going towards Coventry-street; I felt a slight tug at my coat-pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner with my pocket-book in his hand. I snatched at it, and he either dropped it or threw it from him. I picked it up - it contained a 5 l. and one 1 l. note. He ran away immediately, and I secured him without losing sight of him.

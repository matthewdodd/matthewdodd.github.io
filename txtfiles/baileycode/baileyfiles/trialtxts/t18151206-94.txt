            . I lived in the Edgeware Road, and lost these things, on the 8th of October. The prisoner took me from my master's house, on pretence of marrying me, and took me to a church, and went in and spoke to a man, and then come out, and said we were married; I was not married to him, but he pretended to be taking me to be married. He told me he was a shoe-maker, but he was not. I staid out with him four days. He said he would take me down to his mother's at Epping; and when we got there, he said his mother had quitted there. He had my bundle to carry. When we got to Edmonton


, on our return to Town, he told me to wait a moment at the corner of a street, until he returned, and then he never come near me.

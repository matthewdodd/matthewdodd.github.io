            , on the 13th of July
 last. It appeared that the Prosecutor had been at the Restoration Gardens in Southwark, and being detained there by the Rain till it was late, the Prisoner and another offer'd their Service to see him and his Friends safe over the Fields; that he gave them two Bottles of Wine, and they would get a Boat; when they came to the Waterside they said they would see him Home if he would make them Drink, which he (the Prosecutor) readily agreed to; and being got safe on this side the Water, called at a House he used to frequent and treated them with Punch, that the Woman of the House perceiving him to be much in Liquor, persuaded him to lie there, and not venture any farther, so late; that she provided a Bed for him in one Room, and another for the Prisoner and the Person who came with him in another Room; that the Prisoner carry'd the Key of the outer Door up Stairs with him, but the Man of the House enquiring after it, made his Wife fetch it down again, and bring it to him; that when the Prosecutor was a Bed, the Prisoner went into the Room where he lay, and took his Buckles out of his Shoes, and his Sword off the Table, and (the Key being Secur'd by the Master of the House, so that he could not open the Door) was breaking out at the Window with the Sword in his Hand; but being seen by the Watchman, was taken, who took the Sword from him and secured him. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that the Gentleman made him Drunk with Wine and Punch, and he did not know what he did. The Jury found him 

               Guilty

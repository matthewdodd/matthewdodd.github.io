            . I live at Hampstead


, and the prisoner lodged in my house. I losing the things mentioned, suspected her, and upon charging her with it, she owned she took them away. [A pair of clogs, a handkerchief, and a pair of scissors produced in Court.] The prosecutor deposed to the handkerchief and scissors as his property. He produced an iron snuff-box, which he deposed was taken upon the prisoner, in which the money mentioned in the indictment was before taken away.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

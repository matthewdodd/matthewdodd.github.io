1764. 



DAVID JONES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
10th of August, 1 coat, value 10s., the goods of 




James Stocken.






JAMES STOCKEN
. I drive a cab. On the 10th of August I left my cab is Bridge-street, Blackfriars, in charge of Holles for a short time—I left my coat on the driving seat—I returned in about twenty minutes, and it was gone—the prisoner jobs about the rank—I have not seen the coat since.





WILLIAM HOLLES
. I am a coachman out of service. Stocken employed me to clean his harness while he was gone to breakfast—he had been in the habit of employing the prisoner—the prisoner came and took the coat off the cab, and went away with it.





HENRY INSELL
. I am a waiter. I saw the coat on the dickey of the cab—the prisoner walked in and took it off, and went towards Fleet-street.





JAMES STOCKEN

re-examined. He used to take care of my cab in my absence, but I never allowed him to take my coat for any purpose.

Prisoner's Defence, I know nothing about it.

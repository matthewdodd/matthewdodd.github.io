Are you sure the prisoner is the boy? - Yes.
To Prosecutrix. Were any of your things found upon the prisoner? - No; before the Justice he said, I could not have my things, but if I made a charge of them, he must pay for them.
How long before Rebecca Singleton told you of this, had you seen your things? - Not ten minutes before.

When I was taken up, this young woman was sent for; first she said, she did not know me; then she said, she saw me go into the window.

             . On the 6th of September my wife was coming to London in a one horse chaise , and the trunk in which these things were, was lost from behind the chaise between Coombs


 and Cavesham


 . I heard by a waggoner that there was a person who he saw follow the chaise, he described him, and by that means I found him out; he lodged at a Baker's in German-Street, and was taken there: the tweezer case and two rings were found in his pocket the 26th of September. He owned he cut the trunk from behind a one horse chaise; the trunk was found in a field afterwards, and the other things, gowns, wearing apparel, & c. were found by his direction in his box at Mr. Tims a Taylor's at Eaton. I heard by the waggoner that the Prisoner served three years to a Baker
 in Bristol.

             . Mr. Price sent for me when he took the Prisoner in German-Street, and he owned the goods Mr. Price spoke of were at Eaton; these two rings and tweezer case were taken out of his pocket, and he said they were taken out of the box that was left at Eaton. 

               Guilty

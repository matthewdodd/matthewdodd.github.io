             when this was done, I live now in Well-bank-street, Marybone; my shop was broke open, and all the things laid in the indictment were taken out, to the amount of about 2 l. 15 s. I know nothing farther on my own knowledge.

            . On the 2d of March, about four in the morning, at the end of Wigmore-street I met Ash, with butter, pork, eggs and things; I said I was afraid he had stole them; I went to call the watch, he threw down some things and ran; I pursued and took him; I found the hearings and pocket-book in his pocket; another man with him had the saddle, who ran away and left it; (the saddle, tub which the butter was in, two knives, and a cheese knife, produced and deposed to by prosecutor)

            . Ash and I had been and seen this shop, we went home, and ordered the watchman to call us up at one in the morning; he did, we went and opened the shop or stall. and took some of the things out; we returned a second time; returning that time, Ash was taken in Cavendish-square, I ran away; the woman at the bar had one lump of butter, and knew where we got it.
Ash's defence.
I had been drinking with some young fellows, I got in liquor, and fell asleep on an alehouse bench; in the morning I met this evidence; he said he was going to move his things, fearing he should be arrested, and desired me to lend him a hand with them to the Middlesex hospital; it being in my way, I did.

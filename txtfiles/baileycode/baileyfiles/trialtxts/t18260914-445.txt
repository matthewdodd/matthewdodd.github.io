            . I saw the prisoner near the Boltin-Tun, and followed him an another to St. Dunstan's church, where they turned round and followed Mr. Munn for some distance - as soon as they passed him I saw a handkerchief in the prisoner's left hand; I ran and tapped Mr. Munn on the shoulder - he said he had lost a handkerchief - I ran and took the prisoner with it, and then took the other, after some resistance.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating, that he had found the handkerchief on the pavement, and that the prosecutor had stated at Guildhall that he might possibly have dropped it.
Mr. MUNN. I did not say so - I felt it taken from my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner pass me, but did not see it in his hand.
Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.

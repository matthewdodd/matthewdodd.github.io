Mr. Fuller. I am coachman to Mrs. Tyrawley; she sets up her coach at the White Horse, Piccadilly


; the prisoner used to work in the yard; I was sick at the time the coat was lost, which was about four months ago. I found it upon a hackney coachman's back, named 
               
                  John 
                  Thomas 
               



            , in Piccadilly; he said he bought it at the Peacock at Charing Cross. (Produced and deposed to.)


                  John 
                  Thomas 
               



            . I bought this coat of the prisoner at the bar, for half a guinea.


                  John 
                  Higgins 
               



            . I saw 
               
                  John 
                  Thomas 
               



             pay the prisoner some money for a coat one night at the Peacock, Charing Cross; I believe this to be the coat.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence; but call'd 
               
                  Anthony 
                  Pierce

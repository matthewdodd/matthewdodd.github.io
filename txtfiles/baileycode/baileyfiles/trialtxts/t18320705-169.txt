. Eliza Reay has come to my shop repeatedly, with another girl
 - I missed these articles, and on the 19th of May I missed this silk - she and the girl came to my shop; I was called to take my dinner - I left two young men in my shop - when I returned a woman gave me some information; I went to a pawnbroker, and found some of the articles - I then went to Robert and Sarah Reay's house; they are the parents of 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Reay
               



             - they were not at home - some things were found there, and, among the rest, two gown-pieces, which are mine - I merely said it was a pity that they should let the girl go on so.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; the man and his wife live a very short distance from me; I had seen the girl before, but I did not know them; they may have been in the shop.

             (Police-constable K 254). I went on the 21st of May to search

                  Reay
               



            's house - we found Eliza Reay, and took her into custody - on the same day I went to the pawnbroker's, and found part of the property; on the day following I went to the prisoners's house again, and found these two dresses, some calico, and some articles belonging to another person - the father and mother were then in custody; on the 24th I searched the house again, and found some silk in a chimney of a furnace; it is a part of what was lost on the 19th of May.
MR. HOLLAND. I have no doubt this silk, and the other property is mine - the father and mother were in prison when the silk was found.
Cross-examined. Q. Should you not have missed these articles if they had gone altogether? A. We missed them at different times - they could not all he taken at once; two might go at a time; three dozen of gloves were lost, and part of them have been found.

            . I was bound over to appear against the prisoner, and made a confession of what I had done - the Magistrate bound me over; I never saw her take any thing - I went to the prosecutor's house on a Friday, and on Saturday the prisoner asked me to pawn the diaper - she told me to ask 7s. for it; they would lend but 2s. - I took it back to her; I never got any money for pawning things for her.

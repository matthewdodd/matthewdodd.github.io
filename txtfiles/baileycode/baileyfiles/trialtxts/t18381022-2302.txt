EDWARD READ MESBAN
. About half-past six o'clock, on the evening of the 21st of October, I was in Devonshire-square—I felt a tug—I turned and saw the prisoner—I seized him, and my handkerchief dropped from under his coat—it had been safe in my pocket just before—he said another boy gave it to him—I saw another boy, but he escaped.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw another boy take hold of the gentleman's coat tail, and I did not know what he was doing; but he threw down this handkerchief, and the gentleman caught hold of me.

            . The prisoner has been my apprentice
 about two years and a half; when I got up on the 17th of September, I went to seek for him, as he was not in his bed. I missed my watch, and then my coat, a pair of boots, and two pair of shoes. I found the prisoner next day in Smithfield with my watch upon him.

            . I went with Mr. Owen in search of his apprentice, whom he told me had robbed him; we found him in Smithfield; he gave me the watch, and told us where he had pawned the coat. (The coat produced by the pawnbroker, who deposed that he took it in of the prisoner.)
The prisoner said in his defence, that his master used him ill, therefore he ran away and took the watch.

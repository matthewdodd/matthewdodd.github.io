             GERRARD. I am a fishmonger
. I lost my cart on the 27th of October, it was in a recess belonging to Mr. Collins of Old-street


, it was a new cart. On the Sunday I saw these two prisoners looking at my cart, and on the Wednesday I searched for it; I went into Whitecross-street to Mr. Berry the coach-broker, of whom I purchased the axletree and wheels; during the time I was in the yard talking to Mr. Berry 
               
                  Edward 
                  Addison
               



             came into the yard and said to Mr. Berry, I have a nice axle-tree if you will buy it; Mr. Berry looked at the axle-tree. This was on the 30th; he said he had purchased it a fortnight back of a man in Smithfield, and had given fifteen shillings for it; I told him it was my property, and could he bring forward the man that he he said no; I shut the gates andwent for an officer for the prisoners.
MR. BERRY. I am a coach broker. About the 8th of October I sold a pair of wheels, and an axletree to the prosecutor. On the 30th he told me that his cart was finished, and that he had had it stolen; he told me to stop it if I should see it offered for sale. While he was talking the elder prisoner brought the axle-tree; I believe it to be the same axle-tree, it has been in the fire since.

            . This is the axletree, I was present when the prosecutor purchased it; it was put into my possession to make a body for it. I can swear to it being Mr. Gerrards property.

            . I am a salesman at Covent-garden Market
. On Friday evening, the 29th of January, about six o'clock, I packed up about twenty bundles of horseraddish, and next morning about six, missed three or four.

            . On the night of the 30th of January, I saw the prisoners and two more standing together in Drury-lane, near Queen-street. Sackey had two bundles of horse-raddish, and Holdsworth had one - I took Sackey with two bundles; Purcell ran away, and my partner took Holdsworth. Sackey said he brought it from home - that he lived at Hampstead, and was going to sell it.

            . I was with Gates. I had before that seen three boys with horse-raddish, but Purcell was not with them. I informed Gates, looked again, and there was then five in company. I took Holdsworth with a bundle of horse-raddish.

            . I secured Parcel, who ran from the others - he had nothing; and said, he knew nothing of the others, but that they met him in the street, and asked him to sell it for them.

            . I bound two of these bundles myself, and know them well. I believe the other to be mine.
HOLDSWORTH'S Defence. I picked up a bundle; stopped to ask whose it was, and they took me.
SACKEY'S Defence. I packed the bundle up myself, so the man swears false, for they came undone.

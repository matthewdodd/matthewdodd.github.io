            . I am a printer
, and live in Prince's-square, St. George's in the East. On the 25th of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, as I was in Fenchurch-street


, a gentleman informed me my pocket was picked - I turned round, and saw the prisoner cross the street; I saw him drop my handkerchief - I took it up - I am quite sure he is the man; I never lost sight of him - I assisted in taking him; he had not got six yards.

            . I live in Mark-lane, and am a wine-merchant. I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Cotter's pocket, and take the handkerchief out - there was a boy with him, twelve or thirteen years old; I immediately informed Mr. Cotter, and called Stop him!

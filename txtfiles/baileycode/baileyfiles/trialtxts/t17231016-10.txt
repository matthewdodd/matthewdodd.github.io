            , the 25th of September
 last. The Prosecutors depos'd, That the Money was last in the Counting-House, and that the Prisoner was their Servant, in the Capacity of a Footman
; that he went away without their Knowledge, and never return'd; and that when he was apperhended he confess'd the Fact. The Prisoner's Confession was read in Court, wherein he confess'd the Fact before the Justice. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact at the Bar and pleaded, That the Reason of his going away so suddenly was, that the Servant Maid had told his Master that he had the foul Disease, and therefore he would turn him away, unless he brought a Certificate from the Apothecary, that he had no such Distemper. The Master own'd there had been some Talk of that Nature, but told him he was not fully resolv'd whether he would turn him away or not. The Prisoner pleaded, The Reason he confes'd the Fact was, that he hop'd upon confessing it, his Master would have forgiven him. The Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

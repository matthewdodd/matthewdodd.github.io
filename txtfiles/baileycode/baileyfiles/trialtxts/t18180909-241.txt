            . I live at the King's Arms, in the Kent-road. On the 28th of August I was at the lock-up house in Worship-street


, charged with not paying the turnpike toll. I had two half-crowns, three shillings, and a penny-piece in my waistcoat-pocket. I had sent home for some money to pay the fine. The prisoners were confined in the same place with me. I was sober. I went to sleep about two o'clock in the afternoon, as I had been out all night with my master's chaise. I felt somebody touch my waistcoat while I was asleep, and asked what it was; Blyghton, who was next to me, said it was a dog. I went to sleep again; when I awoke I found my pocket turned inside out, and missed my money. There was another man in the watch-house. I said I had lost two half-crowns and a penny, and one of the three must have them. The man produced his money. The officer found a half-crown in each of the prisoner's mouths.
THOMAS GARTON. I am an officer of Worship-street. I searched the prisoners, and found each of them had a half-crown in his mouth. I had searched them before, and they had no money.
BLYGHTON'S Defence. I found it.

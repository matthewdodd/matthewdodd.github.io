            . On the 8th of September I was watching these lads, and saw Wells and Allen draw this sheet through the window of an empty house, next door to Collyer's; I had lost sight of Taylor then - Wells wrapped it up, and put put it under his arm - they made off- when they saw me they began to run, and I pursued them.

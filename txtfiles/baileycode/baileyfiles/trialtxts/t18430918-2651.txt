HENRY BODMAN
. I am a tailor, and live in the Strand, in the parish of St. Clement Danes—Alice Foster was in my service. A little before eight o'clock, on the 15th of Aug., I missed a piece of cloth off the shelf—I stationed myself to watch, about ten the same evening, where nothing could be carried off without my knowing it—I saw George and Diana Foster standing over the area grating—in a few minutes I saw Alice deliver the cloth up to Diana through the railings, and George was standing close to her—I followed them across the Strand—when in Southampton-street, Diana gave the cloth to George Foster—I called an officer—this is my cloth.





WILLIAM CURREY
 (police-constable L 50.) I was called, and saw George Foster with the cloth under his arm—I took it, and asked how he came by it—he said he did not know anything about it—I took him to the station, and there he said he was led into the secret.

George Foster. I said I had no guilty knowledge of it. Witness. You said you knew nothing of it.

GEORGE FOSTER—


GUILTY
. Aged 58.—


Transported for Ten Years.


DIANA FOSTER—


GUILTY
. Aged 13.—



Confined One Month.

            . I am a lace-dealer
, and live on Holborn-hill. On the 4th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Skinner-street


, the witness called to me, I then missed my handkerchief, and found the prisoner in custody with it.

            . I live in Kingsgate-street. I was passing at the bottom of Holborn-hill, and saw the prisoner attempt a gentleman's pocket - I desired Jarvis to be attentive to him. We watched him to the corner of Seacoal-lane, and a few yards from there I saw him take a handkerchief from Mr. Ward's pocket, I ran across, and met him running round the corner of Seacoal-lane. I collared and threw him down, and in the scuffle he threw down the handkerchief; a boy picked it up and gave it to me.

(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I throw myself on your mercy.

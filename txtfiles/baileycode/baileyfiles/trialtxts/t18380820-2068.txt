NORAH CALLAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of August, at 
Lambeth, 1 cloak, value 6s.; 1 cap, value 1s.; and 6 sovereigns; the goods and monies of 



James Devine, her master, in his dwelling-house.






JAMES DEVINE
. I am a pig-dealer, and live in Park-street, Kennington-cross, in the parish of Lambeth. I keep the house—the prisoner was in my service for a fortnight—on the 3rd of August I went out with my wife, between seven and eight o'clock, leaving the prisoner at home—we returned between eleven and twelve o'clock, and she was gone—she had locked the room door, and taken the key with her—I broke the door open, and found my box broken open, and six sovereigns gone—my wife missed a cloak and cap, which have been found.





MARY DEVINE
. I am the prosecutor's wife. I came home with him on the 3rd of August, about twelve o'clock, and missed a cloak and cap—I found the prisoner the same morning on board the Cork steamer, at St. Katherine's Dock, with the cloak on her shoulder—the money had been in a gallipot, in a box, in my bed-room, which was broken open—the cloak was in another box—she had the cap in her bundle—these are them—(looking at them.)





THOMAS FITZGERALD
 (police-constable L 166.) In consequence of information I went to the Cork steamer, in St. Katherine's Docks, on the 4th of August, and there found the prisoner—I found the cloak on her, and in a purse round her neck I found four sovereigns, twelve half-crowns, two shillings and fourpence—the cap was in her bundle, and the key of the door.

Prisoner's Defence. Another one put me up to it—I do not know whether the things belong to her more than a child.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.



Transported for Ten Years.

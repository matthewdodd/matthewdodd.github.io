I am servant to Mr. Pratt, a merchant
 in Lad-lane



: at about seven o'clock on Monday morning, the 6th of October, I found the door of the warehouse, which adjoins to the dwelling-house, broke open: I shut the door myself on Saturday night, and did not see the warehouse again till Monday morning, when I missed one hundred and fifty-two pieces of Irish linen, each containing twenty-five yards. There were two cases broke open, and they had taken a whole box, except one piece, and twenty-two pieces out of the other. I know nothing of the prisoners.
On his Cross Examination he said, that there was no way from the dwelling-house to the warehouse, without going into the street, but that the warehouse and dwelling-house were under one roof; that Mr. Pratt lived in the house, and that he believed both the house and warehouse, were rented together of the Mercers company; that he did not know that the rent for the warehouse was paid out of the partnership stock.

             sworn.
I am warehouse-man to Messrs. Wakefield, Pratt, and Miers.
Who does the warehouse belong to? - The warehouse and house belong to Mr. Pratt; the business is carried on at No 1, in Lad-lane; this is No 6. Upon Monday, the 9th of October, 
               
                  James

             informed me that the warehouse was broke open, and a quantity of linen taken away; I went with him, and missed one hundred and fifty-two pieces of linen: we went immediately and gave information of it to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and distributed handbills, and had it advertised in the news-papers; in consequence of which, upon Tuesday the 14th of November, we had an information, upon which we searched the house of one Cohen a Jew, and found some of the things: Mr. Bond and some of Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's men went to see where he bought the goods. I don't know any more of my own knowledge.
On his Cross Examination he said, that Mr. Pratt had the house and warehouse at No 6, Lad lane; that the rent of the house and warehouse, were paid out of his private stock, and not out of the partnership money; that Mr. Miers, who lives at No 1, Lad-lane, has also a warehouse, with his house; that the other two partners live, one in Clements Court, just by the warehouse, and the other in Ireland; that there was no way into the warehouse out of the dwelling-house.

            's service: I went to search the house of 
               
                  Moses
                   Cohen
               



            ; I found Cohen sitting by the fire in the lower room; when I went in I past him, and went into the bedroom, there I found two pieces of linen; Cohen then told me he would shew me where other things were. I left two men there, and went with Cohen to the house of Saunders Alexander, in Sweet-apple-court, there we found a great number of pieces of linen (the linens were produced in court): Alexander was not in the house when we found the linen there; I don't know it was his house, only Cohen said it was; and when Alexander was taken up, he claimed some goods and money I found in the house.
- JACKSON sworn.
I cannot positively swear to these linens, the marks being cut out; it is like the linen we missed, and I think it is my master's property.

             sworn.
The linen that Mr. Mardale and Halliburton found in my house I bought of the prisoner 
               
                  Clara
                   Benjamin
               



            ; I did not ask her name: she told me where she lived, and said she had a stall in Spital-fields, and any body would tell who she was: I bought some of the linen at my own house, and some at her house: when Mardale and Halliburton came to my house, I said I would shew them where I bought the linen, and I took them to the house.
You don't know the man that kept the house? - No; I never saw a man in the house.
How do you know where she lived? - When I bought the remnants of her, she gave me a direction to Sweet-apple-court, and bid me enquire for the woman that kept a stall in Spitalfields market: on the Monday after prayers I went and found the house, she was up stairs; I don't know whose house it is.

Armstrong, the deceased, came to me on the Saturday night, and told me they were going to do such a place in Lad-lane; they went on Saturday night to try if they could open it; I was not present then.
Was any body present when Armstrong told you that? - Yes, Lyon Abrahams: Armstrong told me it would do; he came to me on Sunday night, and said they had got plenty of fine Irish out of the warehouse; and he would call on me upon Monday morning, which he did, and I and Lyon Abrahams and Armstrong went to the warehouse of Mr. Pratt in Lad-lane: I asked why Alexander was not come, he said he would not get up, he had enough already: I stood at the corner of Aldermanbury and watched for them, while Armstrong and Abrahams brought out two bags, and we took them to Abraham's lodgings.
Do you know nothing of Saunders Alexander being at the house but what Abrahams told you? - No.
Have you told all you know of this affair? - As far as possible I can about the affair; what I know of Lyon Abrahams, Armstrong and myself being in that affair: we carried the goods to Lyon Abraham's house, in Blue-hart-court, Little-bell-alley.
Do you know any thing of

             a good many years: I was going through Bow-street, I asked what was the matter, they said there were a great many Jews at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; I went to the Brown Bear for a pint of beer, a person came to me and said 
               
                  Moses
                   Cohen
               



             wanted me: I went and asked him what he wanted, he asked me to do a favour for him; I asked what it was, he said to swear against 
               
                  Clara
                   Benjamin
               



            , and he would give me two guineas; I said I would not do such a thing for my own father, a woman in my condition, that looked every moment.
What was you to swear? - That I was in the room when she came to sell some linen at his house.
Q. to Cohen. Did you make such an offer to this woman? - No; I don't know any body.

Did you see this woman at Bow-street? - I don't know the woman.
Did you make such an offer to any body? - I never spoke to any body in my life.

Q. to Benjamin. Are you sure Cohen made that offer to you? - Yes; I wish I may never be delivered of my child if he did not.

            's, two women were with Cohen that swore they were in the room when Cohen bought the linen: when they were in the Brown Bear, Cohen said he was afraid of going abroad; Hart said it was hard for him to go abroad, he had a great family; it was no great matter for her to go abroad, as she had no family; he was sitting in the box drinking with them, they were talking together in Hebrew; he cried very much: Hart said what was he crying for, if their witnesses would not do, they would bring two more witnesses to the Old Bailey.

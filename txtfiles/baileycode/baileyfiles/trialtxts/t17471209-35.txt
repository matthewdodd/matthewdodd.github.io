            . I have lost a great many working tools out of the yard, last Monday she stole an ax, I would have given half a crown for what she sold for three pence; she was seen to take something from the sawpits that seemed to be heavy, and they pursued her and took her, and I desir'd they would detain her till I had dined.

            . I work for Mr. Rose, I took the ax from the Prisoner under her coats, and she confessed where she had sold the first ax for three pence.
The Prisoner in her defence said, this ax was given her by a woman.
Warren. I saw the Prisoner come from the sawpits last Tuesday; I saw she took up something heavy, and I followed her to the ditch-side. At first when I saw her she had it in her right hand, then she shifted it to the left hand, and put it under her apron; the files were found in her pocket after she was in Bridewell.

MARY RITCHIE
. I am the wife of Samuel Ritchie, and live at Blackheath. The prisoner was my housemaid for about five weeks—on the morning of the 18th of August, I missed, as I was preparing to go out of town, a variety of artoicles—we had not given her warning; but on missing the things, I sent for an officer, who found some of the property in her trunk, and the rest was found a few days afterwards, tied up in a bundle, in a turbot-kettle—I found two bottles of wine concealed and half a bottle of sherry in her box—the corks had our wine-merchant's name on them—we kept our cellar locked.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when the things were found? A. Yes.





EDWARD VINCENT
. I am a policeman. I was sent for on the 18th of August—I found the prisoner very much intoxicated—I charged her with having her mistress's property—she denied it—I said I should search her box—she gave me the keys, and Mrs. Ritchie went with me to the box—I found part of a bottle of sherry and two pairs of white stockings—the prisoner brought a bundle of her dirty clothes down-stairs about half an hour after, and in it I found a net cap—I found this small piece of a gown on her.

Cross-examined Q. She was very tipsy? A. Yes; she confessed it two hours and a half after, when she was sober—she gave me the keys of her trunk.

MRS. RITCHIE
re-examined. This is part of the gown I lost—It was worth more thab 3l.—the other articles are mine, and I believe the wine to be mine.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Third Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

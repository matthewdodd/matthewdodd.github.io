            . I belong to the live-guards
. On the 21st of December I had been out to receive some money, and staying late, I light with an old soldier, a countryman of mine; we went into a public-house in Hedge-lane, I do not know the sign; I went to go home between twelve and one at night, I set off by myself; I was not sober, nor was I fuddled; when I got to the end of the lane, I think it was Coventry-street, I met three young men all of smallish stature; I said, gentlemen, which way are you going; they said, to Grosvenor-square; I said, so am I, and should be glad of their company; we walked together till we came to lower Grosvenor-street


; one of them walked on my right hand, the other two behind me; one of them behind me, came and sell by my left leg; he by my side pushed me over him, and he sell upon me; it was Burford that was under me; the other man stood two or three yards behind me; I got up, and thought it was only accidental; when I got home I missed my watch; then I thought I lost it the time I sell; I went to Justice Fielding, and described my watch and the men to be advertised; on Wednesday the 23d, I had a note from Sir John to come immediately to his office, there I found three men in custody; the two prisoners I knew, but the other I did not; Miller is the man that stood behind me, he never meddled with me; there was my watch; Burford said he bought it of a Jew, I do not remember he said when or where; I had a great opportunity of seeing him, I knew him again perfectly.

                  Bond 
               



            . On the 22d of December about nine at night, there was information brought against Miller, concerning a pocket-book, and that he was at a bad house in St. Giles's; I went there, and found him and Burford together in a back room; Burford had his hand behind his back; I said, what have you got there; he said nothing; I opened his hand, there was this watch; (produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor.) I brought them to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; the clerk said, that watch, seal and chain, were described to them about two hours before.
Q. to prosecutor. When had you your watch last?
Phipps. I know I had it that evening, at the Castle and Falcon in Aldersgate-street.
Burford's defence.
On the 22d of December about two in the afternoon, I bought this watch of a Jew for a guinea and a half; I lay at home, and went to bed that night at 11 o'clock; Miller was locked out, and he lay with me as my mother was gone to bed.
Miller's defence.
I went into Jemmy Boswell's house, on the ruins of St. Giles's, there was Burford there; Bond came in and took us away; I know nothing of the matter; I am a brazier, and work with my father.
For Miller.


                  Mary 
                  Miller 
               



            . I am mother to Miller the prisoner.
Q. Do you know Burford?
M. Miller. I never saw him before my son was taken up.
Q. Where was your son on the 21st of December?
M. Miller. He came home about 11 o'clock; I let him in myself, and locked the door afterwards.
Note, Miller's mother was not in court when Burford made his defence.

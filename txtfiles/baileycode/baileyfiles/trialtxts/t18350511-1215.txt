SIDNEY SADLER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the the 
29th of April, 1 pair of bellows, value 3s., the goods of 



Robert Plumley.






ELIZABETH PLUMLEY
. I am the wife of Robert Plumley—we keep a broker's shop, in Old-street. I received information, and missed my bellows on the 29th of April—the prisoner was brought back with them—these are them—they had been on a chair, on the top of a table, in the shop.





JOHN BRANSCOMBE
. I am apprentice to Mr. Thomas Clark, a turner, in Old-street. I was opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner and two others, older than him—the prisoner took the bellows—he put them under his jacket, and walked to the next street—he then ran—I brought him back, and the officer took him—I did not see him come out of the shop—they were as near the front of the shop as they could be—I cannot say whether they were on the table or under it.

Q. Did the boys appear to be connected? A. Yes; they were sitting at the private door, when I passed by half an hour before, and were eating bread and butter—they all ran off when the prisoner took the bellows.





JOHN BROOMING
 (police-constable G 174.) I took the prisoner—he said another boy took the bellows.





CHARLES SANDERS
. I was passing at the time; I saw a larger boy take the bellows off the chair, and put them under the table—the prisoner then went and took them.




GUILTY
. Aged 11.—


Transported for Seven Years.

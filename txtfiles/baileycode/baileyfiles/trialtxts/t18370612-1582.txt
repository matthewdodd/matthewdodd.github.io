JOSEPH BARR
 was indicted

 for obtaining, by false pretences, of 



Orange Lemon, 1 pair of pistols, value 30s.; 1 percussion gun, value 4l.; 1 powder-flask, value 5s.; 1 watch, value 3l.; 1 watch-chain, value 6s.; and 2 seals, value 30s.; his goods.






ORANGE LEMON
. I am a gunsmith. On the 10th of May the prisoner came to my shop, at Hampton-wick—he said he came from Teddington for a brace of pistols for Mr. Strachan's son—I knew Mr. Strachan, and said, "Has Mr. Strachan got a son big enough to use pistols?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I don't like to send pistols without his father knew of if—he said his father was present when he gave the order—the value of them was about 305.—I gave him a pair—he came the next day, about seven o'clock in the evening—the first word I said was, "How about the pistols?"—he said, "You will know all about that to-morrow; I want a percussion gun: they are going to shoot: my young master has thrown down his watch, and put his foot upon it, and he wants a watch to go to the dinner table"—I said, "What sort of a watch was it?"—he said, "Like that," pointing to one—I said, "Take it"—he had the powder-flask and the other things stated, as I thought he was Mr. Strachan'a groom—he was dressed like a groom.





JAMES MORGAN STRACHAN
, Esq. I live at Teddington. I do not know the prisoner—he was never in my service—I have no son—I never sent the prisoner for these articles.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

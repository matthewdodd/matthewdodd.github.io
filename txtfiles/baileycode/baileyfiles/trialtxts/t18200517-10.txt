            . I live in St. John-street-road. On the 11th of March, about one o'clock in the day, I was in St. John-street


, and felt a catch at my coat pocket, put my hand down and missed my handkerchief. I turned round and saw the prisoner put it into his jacket pocket. I immediately seized him, and he struggled to get away, but did not succeed. He said he had nothing belonging to me. I saw him put his hand behind, pull it from his pocket, and let it drop. I caught it before it reached the ground, another boy was with him, who ran away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it off the ground - the gentleman knocked me down and beat me.

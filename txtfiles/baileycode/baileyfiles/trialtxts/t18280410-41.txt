                  , from his person
            .
JOHN MILNER. I live in Tooley-street, Borough, and am a draper
. On the 5th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Lower Thames-street


; there was a considerable crowd caused by a stoppage of carts, and as I was passing a cart, I felt something at my pocket; I turned sharp round, and found the prisoner immediately behind me, with my handkerchief in his hand, folding it into a small compass; I secured him, sent for a constable, and gave him in charge; my handkerchief was safe in my pocket when I left home, and I went straight there.

            . I am a constable, and received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going on an errand for my father - there was a crowd in Thames-street; the handkerchief was thrown quite across my arms by somebody - I took it up, and before I could speak the gentleman seized my hand, and said, "What have you got?"
MR. MILNER. It is impossible that could have occurred - he said at first that it was thrown at him; but when he found I was determined to give charge of him, he fell on his knees, begged pardon, and said he would not do it again.

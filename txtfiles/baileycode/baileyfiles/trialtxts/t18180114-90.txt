            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Fleet-market


. On the 16th of January the prisoner came to my shop about three in the afternoon, my young man asked her what she wanted, she gave him no answer, but staid at the counter-three persons were serving in the shop; she was going out, I asked her what she wanted, she said she wanted a whittle, but would call again-several persons were in the shop. I went to her and asked her what was under her shawl, she immediately threw the scarf on the counter, and begged for mercy.

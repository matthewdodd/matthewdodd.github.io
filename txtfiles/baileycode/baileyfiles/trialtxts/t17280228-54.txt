            , Esq
;
Mr. Vaughan depos'd, That the Prisoner came with the Glass to his House, and offered it to Sale, but he suspecting it to be stole, thought convenient to have him taken into Custody till he could clear himself, and find out the Owner. Arra Dear Joy, said the Prisoner, will you be hanging me, or transporting me; but indeed you look like a very honest Man, and if you will be excepting on it yourself, you shall be very welcome, and then, dear Joy, I shall have no more Trouble about the Matter; but Mr. Vaughan having too great a Regard to Justice, to stifle the Matter for the Advantage of the Glass, detected dear Joy in his Villany. He said in his Defence, that he was buying it of a very honest Man, and indeed he gave 12 Shillings for it, and no more; but the Man he bought it of was a Stranger to him, for he never saw him before, yet and indeed he had a very honest Face. The Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d.

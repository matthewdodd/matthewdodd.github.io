247. 




WILLIAM JONES
 and 




HENRY LEWIS
 were indicted for

 stealing 25lbs. weight of rope, value 6s., the goods of 



Richard Hallum; and that Jones had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD HALLUM
. I am master of a brig. Last Saturday evening she was lying in the Thames, close to the Tunnel—I had some rope on board—I saw it safe on Friday, and I saw it at the police-office on Saturday at half-past five o'clock—I am sure it is mine—this is it.





JOSEPH SHAIN
 (Thames police-constable, No. 40.) Last Saturday I saw the two prisoners and another person, who got away, go into the Stone-wharf at Wapping—two of them went down on the shore, and I lost sight of them—I went out, and left my brother officer—he called me back, and said they were coming out of the yard, and two of them had a rope—I stopped Jones with this rope on his shoulder—the other two made their escape then, but Lewis was one of them I am sure.

Lewis. He could not tell who it was, as it happened in the dark; how did he know me? Witness. Because I know him so well—I had seen him an hour previously.





HENRY JOSEPH HAVINGDON
 (Thames police-constable, No. 45.) I saw Jones with some rope—Lewis was in company with him, but he got away.

Jones's Defence. I was stopped by a young man who asked if I wanted a job; I stopped, and he got up two lots of rope; he gave me one, and carried one himself: I was going with him, but was stopped, and he ran away.

Lewis's Defence. I know nothing at all about it; I had not been in this prisoner's company at all.





CHARLES WOOD
 (police-constable K 233.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner Jones's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 25th Feb., 1845, and confined three months)—he is the person—he has been summarily convicted since.

JONES*—


GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

GUILTY
. Aged 17.—

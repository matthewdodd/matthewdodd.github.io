            . Between twelve and one o'clock on the 29th of July, as I was going down Barbican


, I felt something go from my pocket; I felt, and missed my handkerchief; I turned, and saw the prisoner about a yard from me, with it partly out of his right-hand breeches pocket - I said, "My boy, whose handkerchief have you got there?" and made a snatch at it; he ran off, and was taken within forty or fifty yards - this is the handkerchief; my nose had bled in the morning, and it has the mark of blood on it now.

            . I received the prisoner, and found another handkerchief on him; I asked him what mark was on it, and he gave me quite a different mark to what is on it.
Prisoner's Defence. My mother bought it at a pawnbroker's; I wore it on my neck till lately - this other one I picked up at the step of a door; there were two or three young men walking by me - I did not know what they had done.

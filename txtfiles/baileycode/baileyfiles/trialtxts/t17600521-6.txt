            . I live in Tower street


, the prisoner was my servant
 for 6 or 8 weeks, I lost a pair of buckskin breeches, I charged the prisoner with taking them; she own'd she did, and had sold them to one Dearing in Rosemary lane for 5 s. (they cost me 25 s. and were but just soiled) we went there, he denied buying them; said he did not know her, or that he never saw her: she told him to his face every particular; she said it was on a Monday morning.

            . I was constable of the Night; the prisoner own'd before Mr. alderman Gosling she had taken the breeches, and sold them to one Dearing in Rosemary lane; we went there with her, the man said he had not bought any buckskin breeches for 3 months. She said, she ask'd him 6 s. and he would give her but 5, and insisted upon what she said to be truth: he said he did not know her.

Prisoner's Defence.
My prosecutor said, if I would own it he would let me free; so I own'd it, that he might let me go out of the compter.
Q. to prosecutor. Did you make her any promise?
Prosecutor. I said I would make it as easy as possible if she would let me know where my breeches and things were. I lost other things; but I did not say I would not prosecute her.




               Guilty, 4 s. 10 d.

. On the 18th of May the prisoner came into my shop, and asked the price of a piece of bacon - I was in the parlour; I turned, and saw her going out - I went, turned up her shawl, and found this piece of bacon; I asked what she meant by taking it - she said she was very sorry, and hoped I would not prosecute her; I did not know her - here are 8lbs. or 9 lbs. of bacon.

GEORGE BRADLEY
. I am shopman to Joseph Allison, of Regent-street. On Tuesday, the 11th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the pri-soner came to our shop—I went to the top of the shop, and saw her take ft piece of silk from two shutters supported on tressels, for showing the goods—she sat down on a chair—I passed by her, and saw part of it protruding through her cloak—I asked what she had there, and said, "That won't do"—she said, "Pray, forgive me"—I took her into the back room, and sent for Mr. Allison and a constable—I gave the silk to the constable—there is above thirty yards—it is worth more than 6l. at the wholesale price—it is French silk.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What was paid for it? A. 4s. a yard—the mark is on it—there is about thirty yards—when I said, "What have you got here?"—she made no reply at first—she said, "Pray, forgive me"—when I took the silk from her she appeared fainting—she came in to match a very peculiar silk about a fortnight before.

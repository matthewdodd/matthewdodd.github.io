            . I am patrol of Whitechapel. I met the prisoner about seven o'clock on Sunday night, the 28th of October, going down Whitechapel-road, he slipped by me - I stopped him, he was carrying a sack. I asked what he had there; he said he did not know, but that a man had just given it him by Mile End turnpike. I found it contained thirty-two planes. I said "Why these are planes;" he said "Yes, they are," and that he did not know the man, nor where he was going to take them. I took him. This was about a mile and a half from Mr. Warren's.

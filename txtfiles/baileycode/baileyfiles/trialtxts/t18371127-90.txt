 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

Louisa Garrett.






ELEANOR POTTO
 I am single, and am a milliner, living in Little Mortimer-street. On the 25th of November, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour which communicates with the shop, and saw the prisoner come from behind the counter, and run out—I ran out, and saw him rolling up a cloak—he ran away, and I after him, calling "Stop thief," up Mortimer-street, Portland-street, into Regent-street—he dropped the cloak at the corner, and was stopped by the policeman—this is the cloak, and this shawl which was with it, belongs to Louisa Garret—the prisoner was quite a stranger.





WILLIAM DUKE
. I am a policeman. I heard an alarm of" Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running with the property under his arm—I pursued and secured him.




GUILTY
. * Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

- Lancaster. I am servant to Messrs. Grace and Kennedy, linen-drapers


 in Cornhill


. I saw the prisoner open the door, come into the shop, and take a piece of linen off the counter. I was behind a door watching him. We had been robbed twice before. I had seen the prisoner loitering about the door, and suspecting him, I watched him; he took the piece off the counter; he reached, and laid hold of the piece; he was not entirely within the door, I believe; he reached his hand out, and took it; he carried it off: I pursued him directly. When he saw me after him, he threw it down just by the door. I secured him.
Q. Had he no business in your shop?
Lancaster. None. (The piece produced, and deposed to.)
- Hall. I was passing by Mr. Kennedy's door; I saw the prisoner come backwards with the piece of linen upon his left arm; he threw it down upon the flat stones, and ran into the middle of the street. Mr. Lancaster ran after him, and cried, Stop thief. The prisoner ran up Gracechurch-street, and ran into the Skin Market, Leadenhall-street; there we took him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am a foreigner. All that gentleman speaks is false. I am a shoemaker; I made a pair of shoes for a gentleman in Lincoln's-inn fields; he said to me, I never saw you in the synagogue in my life. It was about half an hour after four. He went along with me; I saw a great mob in a street, I don't know the name of it; I can't speak English; I was running to see what was the matter, and that gentleman took hold of me. I know nothing about it. It was 
               
                  James
                   Mitchell
               



             that was along with me.
For the Prisoner.


                  James
                   Mitchell
               



            . I live at Mr. Morgan's in Lincoln's-inn-fields. I am a hosier. The prisoner made me a pair of shoes; he brought them home this day six weeks. He asked me to take a walk to see the synagogue in Duke's Place. As we were going up Cornhill, we heard a great cry of Stop thief, stop thief. The prisoner said, he would go and see what was the matter; we were then about an hundred yards beyond the Royal Exchange, in Cornhill.
Q. Which way did the cry of Stop thief come?
Mitchell. They went towards Leadenhall-market. He left me, and said, he would come to me presently; - he went towards Leadenhall-market; the mob was before us; he ran and joined the mob. I staid some time, and he did not come home; they told me at last, that he was taken up for stealing something out of a shop; I heard that at his lodgings.
Q. What time was this?
Mitchell. About five o'clock.
Q. Did you go to see him?
Mitchell. Not till about a fortnight or three weeks after. I went directly home to my lodgings.
Q. Who gave you an account at the prisoner's lodgings that he was taken up?
Mitchell. I don't know.
Q. Had not you the curiosity to enquire where he was gone, or what was become of him?
Mitchell. I did not trouble my head about it.
Q. Did not you think it extraordinary, that an innocent man should be taken up for this thing? Did not you see him?
Mitchell. I did not know where; I set out, five days after, for Leicester.
Court. That will not do.
Mitchell. I can't say any more.
Court. But I have something more to say to you. You was told he was taken up?
Mitchell. Yes, I asked the people, but they could not inform me where he was gone to.
Q. What did they say?
Mitchell. They said he was taken up for shop-lifting.
Q. Did not you know at whose house?
Mitchell. No.
Q. How long have you lived in London?
Mitchell. Eight years; I have lived with lord Waltham, and the biggest noblemen in the land.
Q. So you would persuade me and the jury, that you that have lived in London eight years, did not know how to find out a man that was taken up for shop-lifting? How came you not to find him out, and give your testimony in his favour, that he was innocent, as you had been with him the whole time?
Mitchell. I have nothing more to say.
Court. But you must have something more to say.
Mitchell. I thought no harm would come of it, because I knew he was innocent, so I did not give myself any further trouble.
Q. And so you suffered this innocent man to lie in gaol, and never went near him, nor gave him any assistance till a fortnight ago? How did you find out then where he was?
Mitchell. By a friend of his.
Q. Who might it be?
Mitchell. Mrs. Hart; I met her in the street; she told me; that is about a fortnight ago.
Q. In what street?
Mitchell. In Newgate-street.
Q. What did she tell you?
Mitchell. That he was in Newgate for the affair that happened when I was with him. I have no more to say.
Q. So you went to Newgate?
Mitchell. Yes.
Q. Did you go that same day?
Mitchell. No, the next day.
Q. Do you know where Messrs. Grace and Kennedy live?
Mitchell. No.
Q. Do not you where the house is he is accused of stealing the goods from?
Mitchell. I do not indeed.
Q. to Lancaster. Do you know any thing of that man?
Lancaster. I cannot positively swear to the man; I think I have seen him before.
Q. Did you ever see him with the prisoner?
Lancaster. I am not certain whether I have or not.

                   Hart
               



            . I have known him five or six months; he made shoes for me and my daughter.
Q. Did not he lodge in your house?
Hart. No, he lodged with one Hart.
Q. Do you know Mitchell?
Hart. Yes; he went out with him, when this happened, to the synagogue, I think.
Q. When did you first hear that Mitchell was along with him?
Hart. The day before yesterday.
Q. Who told you so?
Hart. The people that were here to give him a character told me so.
Q. Did not you know Mitchell before the day before yesterday?
Hart. No.
Israel Josephs. I have known him about six months; he is a shoemaker by trade; I never saw any ill of him.
Q. Do you know 
               
                  James
                   Mitchell
               



            , an acquaintance of his?
Josephs. No.
Q. to Lancaster. You said you watched the prisoner, and saw him come i and take the cloth, and then run away; had you your eye upon him?
Lancaster. He was never out of my sight till I got hold of him.
Q. Was there a great number of people?
Lancaster. No, but few; nobody pursued him but myself and the other evidence.
Q. There was no crowd of people then intercepted your view of him?
Lancaster. No; he was never more than five or six yards before me.
Q. Had there been any alarm that afternoon before this happened?
Lancaster. No.
Q. Had you seen 
               
                  Mitchell
               


             that day?
Lancaster. I had seen somebody with the prisoner that ran the other way: I do not recollect that I saw Mitchell at that time.
Q. You have heard what Mitchell has said; have you any doubt now that the prisoner is the man?
Lancaster. Not in the least.
Q. What time was it?
Lancaster. Almost dusk; the lamps were lighting.
Q. to Hall. You say you saw the prisoner come out with linen on his left arm?
Hall. Yes; somebody opened the door from the inside; he threw the linen down, and then he ran into the middle of the highway. Mr. Lancaster pursued him, and cried, Stop thief. He was never out of my sight.
Q. How far is Mr. Kennedy's above the 'Change?
Hall. About three hundred yards.
Q. What time was this?
Hall. It wanted about twenty minutes of six.
Q. to one of the Jews. What time did your Synagogue begin about the first of March?
A Jew. About five o'clock.
Q. to Mitchell. You may have an opportunity of explaining any thing you have said, or correcting it, if you have made a mistake; now what do you say?
Mitchell. I have spoke as far as my abilities will allow to the best of my knowledge.
Q. Do you now swear that there was a crowd in the street?
Mitchell. A great many people, the prisoner said he would run and see what was the matter.
Q. Before the prisoner ran at all, was there a cry of Stop thief?
Mitchell. Yes.
Q. You and the prisoner were walking along quietly together when you heard the cry of Stop thief?
Mitchell. He was before me about ten yards; he stopped to tell me there was a cry of Stop thief.
Q. Did you hear this cry?
Mitchell. No.
Q. After the prisoner had said he would go and see what it was; which way did he go?
Mitchell. Towards Leadenhall market.
Q. What side of Cornhill was you on?
Mitchell. The right-hand side.
Q. What side was he?
Mitchell. The right-hand side, both of us.
Q. In the foot way?
Mitchell. Yes.
Q. Did he run along in the same foot-way, or did he go along the middle of the street?
Mitchell. He was gone in a moment; I could not see.
Q. What do you say about the time?
Mitchell. It was between five and six, very near six to the best of my knowledge.

Q. Which way did you go to his lodgings afterwards?
Mitchell. Through Leadenhall Street.
Q. Then you must have gone by Leadenhall market?
Mitchell. Yes; the crowd was all gone when I went by there; I stopped some time where I was; I followed the crowd gently on.
Q. What became of that crowd?
Mitchell. I can't tell; I never like to interfere in a crowd.
Q. What side of Leadenhall Street did you go down?
Mitchell. The left-hand side; I crossed the way at the pastry cook's.
Q. Then you might stay long enough to see your friend come back?
Mitchell. No; I kept walking on.
Q. How long did you wait for him?
Mitchell. Two or three minutes.
Q. I suppose you expected to meet him in the crowd. You did not stay to see what happened?
Mitchell. No; I always keep from a crowd.
Court. I think you was right not to stay. Both these gentlemen saw this man come out of the shop, and he was never out of their sight; how do you account for this?
Mitchell. People might run; I cannot be accountable for that.
Q. Do you suppose they are mistaken with regard to this man, that it was not him?
Mitchell. I cannot say.
Q. You do not suppose your friend ran along after he had left you, and committed this felony, do you?
Lancaster. We brought him back in less than four minutes; if he had been there we must have met him.
Q. This synagogue began before six, I believe, at that time?
Mitchell. I do not know; he asked me if I would take a walk and see it.
Q. He said you desired to see it?
Mitchell. I asked him if he could shew it me; he said he could.

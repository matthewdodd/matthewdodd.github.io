            . I live at Westminster: I lost a sow about a month ago; yesterday three weeks one Mr. Brown, a neighbour, took me to the prisoner's lodging; I saw the sow; it was cut up; it had received a cut a-cross the loins with a saw, that was not healed; I knew it to be mine by that wound. The prisoner had been taken up for something else, and was in Bridewell; I went there, and asked him how he could kill my sow, and he laughed me to scorn.

            . I am a constable: I saw the sow in the prisoner's room; it was all bloody, and there was an axe there all bloody.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been at work by the water side; coming home between eight and nine o'clock I saw this sack; I took it home, and there appeared to be a pig in it; I could not tell whose it was; I let it lie in my room till next day; then I scalded it, and salted it; it had been in salt ten days before the prosecutrix came and swore to it.

            . On the 24th of November, near twelve at noon, I was going up Holborn. The prisoner came up to me; he said it was slippy. I said it was. I turned up Brook-street; I was going to Brooks'-market. He came up to me, and said, you took no notice of me. I said, I did not know him. He said he came from Durham, and I said I came from Scotland. He said, he had been there a few months back. He said he was left an executor: he was come up to receive some money for a family; he was going to buy some land in Scotland. He said he was going down in the same stage I was. I said I was going down in a Berwick ship. He said he knew the captain; he was going down in the same ship. We came to the top of the street, and talked a little while. I told him I was going to a friend of mine, at No. 1. He then asked me to have a pint of beer in a public-house. I went in with him. We had a pint of beer; I was going to pay for it.
Q. What sign was it - A. I cannot say. It was in Gray's-inn-lane. I was going to pay for it. He said I have too many halfpence; I want to get rid of them. I told him I had got a ten-pound Suffolk and Essex note. I asked him where the bankers was in London. He asked me to see the note. I shewed it him. He said, it was a very good one, and returned it to me. There was another man came into the room; he asked if we had seen a woman in the room. I told him, no, there had been none in since we came in. He said he had given the woman a ten-pound note to get a suit of clothes, and she had not come back; he was going to marry her. We asked him what sort of a woman it was. He told us, and the prisoner and I told him it was some girl of the town. Then he told us that he had been with some soldiers the night before, and had been playing at cards, and different gambling with them; he had met with this girl there; he had brought her up with him; he was going to be married to her that day. He said he came from Coventry; he came up and had taken a good deal of money that was left to him. He put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a great many notes, and a purse with some guineas in it. The prisoner looked at them, and said they were large notes, some were fifty's, and some hundred's. After that, the prisoner, on talking about gambling, said, how foolish it was; perhaps, he said, you will like to gamble with me. He said he would, if he would not tell his wife.
Q. Did they pretend to be acquainted with each other - A. No, quite strangers. Then the prisoner put down a guinea first, and the other man put down a guinea. I think the prisoner put down a halfpenny on the table. The guinea each was the stake, and the halfpenny to play with. They put it under the hat. They asked me to turn the halfpenny over, which I did; then after that I turned it over two or three times. The prisoner said he had won the guinea. They called head and tails. The other man put down another halfpenny; he called whatever he thought it was. I was to turn the halfpenny; then after that he gave him the guinea again; he said, go home and have no more to do with that woman. The prisoner then said, suppose you play with this man for twenty pounds. I said, no, I work too hard for my money. He took the note out of my hand, and laughed, and said it was only to shew the other man how foolishly he had lost his money. He then asked me to turn the halfpenny over, which I did; then after I had turned it two or three times; he said that the other man had gained it. He took it from the table, and gave it him. I said, I was not going to lose my money so. He then proposed that me and the other man should shew him a sum of money in a few minutes. I told him I had got no money to shew. He laid some great sum. I cannot say what. He got up, went to the door. I went after him to the door. He told me not to be afraid of my money. He went perhaps ten yards or more from the door. I thought I had been in bad company, and that I should be done out of my money; recollecting that the other man had got the money, I went back to secure him. On my going into the room the other man was gone, and on my return in the street the prisoner was gone. I asked in the public-house if they saw that man go out; they said, no.
Q. Did you ever get your money again - A. No, I have not got it.
Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. This was on the Tuesday, I saw him at Bow-street on the Thursday.
Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the person - A. Yes, I am sure of that. I have never seen the other man since.

            . I am one of the beadles of St. Andrews, Holborn. On Tuesday morning, the 24th of last month, I was coming up Grays-inn-lane, between twelve and one at noon. I met the prisoner and his brother just coming from the Marquis of Granby public-house, Grays-inn-lane. As soon as the prisoner passed me he sat up a run, and ran down Portpool-lane. His brother followed, and spoke to me as he passed: - how do you do, sir. When I came to the door of the public-house I saw the prosecutor come out, apparently very agitated and frightened. I asked him, what was the matter.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes, I have known him twenty years. I am certain of his person. I learned of the prosecutor that he had been robbed. I took him to the police office, Hatton Garden. He gave information of his being robbed. I requested that they would send off immediately to the bankers and stop payment of the note, which I understood they did.
JOHN LOW. I am a clerk to Messrs. Barclay and Co. The prosecutor and a police officer came to our house, I think about two o'clock, to stop a note.
Q. Have you got the note here - A. Yes, I have. A jew woman brought it to our house. It has been in my possession ever since.
Q. Did you stop the person - A. I did not. I had not get the number or date when it came in. The prosecutor came in about half an hour. Theprosecutor described the note, and from the description he gave I have kept the note ever since. This is the note.
Q. to prosecutor. Do you know the note - A. I have no reason to doubt it is my note. My note was cut across, and paper pasted over it, and this is the same. I went to the bankers, and saw the other notes that came in. Some of them were cut across, but I did not know them. This I did. There is a name upon this note like the name on my note.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner. I found guineas upon him. There were two other men with him. When I told him my name, and who I was, the other man ran away. I found a purse of guineas on the prisoner, and a two-guinea piece. The prosecutor described what was put on the table looked like a two-guinea piece.
Prosecutor. I cannot say that two-guinea piece is the same, it is similar.

            . The prosecutor and the prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of beer. After that, the prisoner's brother came in, and called for a pint of ale. I knew them both by sight for years, in the neighbourhood. After I had served them I was down in the cellar. I saw nothing more. They paid me for what I brought in. I keep the Marquis of Granby, Gray's-inn-lane. The prosecutor had been to the door: he came to me, and asked me where the gentleman in the parlour was. I did not know he had gone out.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge of stealing the note. It was a gambling transaction, and voluntary on that man's part. He had two ten-pound notes, and it was with difficulty I persuaded him not to play with them both. He said, let me put a ten-pound note on the table first, and when he put his ten-pound note down I will run away with it. I told him if we took that man's ten-pound note we should get into trouble; if he won it fairly it would be all right.

            . Between three and four o'clock on the 14th of February, I saw the two prisoners together at the back of the Mansion-house


 - Lane had his hand in a gentleman's pocket; I saw him pull a handkerchief out, and hand it to the other prisoner, who put it under his jacket - the gentleman turned, and asked me to run after them, as he was lame; I ran after them, saw the street-keeper, and asked him to take them; he said, "Go on, and take hold of them yourself, for they will see my hat;" I ran on, and took Johnson in a court - some men pursued Lane, and took him; Johnson threw down the handkerchief when I took him - I have not seen the gentleman since.

            . I took Lane, and have the handkerchief here.
Lane's Defence. We were walking together, and found the handkerchief - this lad took it up, and put it under his jacket, and when we got a little way we ran.
Johnson received an excellent character, and a witness engaged to employ him.

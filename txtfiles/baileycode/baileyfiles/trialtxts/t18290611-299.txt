JOHN PRIGMORE. I am a tailor
. The prisoner was my apprentice
; he had been twelve months with me; he absconded during the absence of myself and wife, on the 1st of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - I saw him, at half-past six next morning, playing at pitch and toss, in Elizabeth-street, Whitechapel - I had missed these articles, and a good many others; when I took him, he said he had sold the waistcoat and shawl -I found on him a purse, containing 4s. 5d. and two knives - he said nothing.

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor gave the prisoner to me; his friends live near me, and his master thought he would come home; he found him playing with some sweeps - this purse and two new knives were found on him.
JOHN PRIGMORE. This is my purse.
Prisoner. Forgive me this time; I will never do the like again. 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.

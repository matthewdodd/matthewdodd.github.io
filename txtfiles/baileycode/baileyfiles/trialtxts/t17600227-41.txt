            . The prisoner was my servant
. I lost sundry goods, but have only laid the two pieces in the indictment which I found at the White-Hart, in Foster-Lane, on the 14th of February. I had taken a green piece out of his pocket, which was in the kitchen, as I went to wash my hands. I saw it stand bunching out, so I charged the prisoner with taking it, and he confessed he had stolen these two pieces, and sold them to 
               
                  David 
                  Jones 
               



            , a taylor, where I found them.
Q. from Prisoner. Was it not in our agreement that I might sell goods to any of my acquaintance, and be allow'd a profit?
Stretton. I had a good character with the prisoner. I never allow'd him to carry any goods out, but told him, that if he behaved well, and his acquaintance wanted any thing for ready money, if they came to the shop he should have a profit what they bought.

                  Jones 
               



            . I am a taylor, I order'd these goods, and they were sent me; his master was backwards, and I gave him the order. I have heard Mr. Stretton say since that, that he gave the prisoner liberty to sell goods in the shop, and to have the profit of them, to his acquaintance.



               Acquitted
            .
He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing one piece of green knit worstead for breeches, value 5 s
            . the property of

            . I went into the kitchen to wash my hands, and not finding a towel I look'd in the drawer, where I saw the prisoner's coat with the pocket bulging out; I looked into it, and took out a piece of green worstead for breeches [produced in court, and deposed to.] I went up stairs and mention'd it to some ladies, and desired two of them to go down; they went and saw it, and I charged the prisoner with taking it; he denied his having any intention to rob me of it, said that he intended to sell it and bring me the money, and that he was to carry it to Westminster to a man to sell.

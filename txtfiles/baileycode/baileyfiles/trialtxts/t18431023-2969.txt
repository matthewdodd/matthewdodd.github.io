JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of Sept., 1 coat, value 4s., the goods of 



William Freeman.






CATHERINE FREEMAN
. I am the wife of William Freeman. About eleven o'clock, on the 26th of Sept, I answered a knock at the door, and found the prisoner there—he said he came from the tailor's for a coat—I showed him into the parlour, and sent for Mr. Freeman, but he did not come—I then went to the parlour door and asked the prisoner if he came from Mr. Graves of Holborn—he said yes—believing he came from there, I went up stairs, brought this coat down, and gave it him—he went away, and in ten minutes my husband came in.





WILLIAM FREEMAN
. I did not send the prisoner for my coat on the 26th of Sept.—this is my coat—I overtook the prisoner in Margaret-street, and asked him if he was the person who called at my house for a coat—he said he was, and told me he would let me have the coat—he took me into a house in Margaret-street, and gave it me out of a handkerchief in which there was another coat.





RICHARD GRAVES
. I do not know the prisoner—I did not send him for, the coat.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . On the 10th of October I went with the prisoner to her lodgings, in Church-lane, St. Giles's


. Between three and four o'clock in the morning, I awoke and found her gone-the door was fastened. I missed my neck-handkerchief and watch from under my pillow; I found them at the pawnbroker's the same day. I met her in the street at night, and secured her. I am sure she is the same woman.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 11th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I took the watch in pledge of the prisoner - about an hour after she pledged the handkerchief; she said they belonged to her husband.
SAMUEL FURZEMAN. On the 11th of October the prisoner was brought into the watch-house; while I was searching her she dropped the duplicate of the handkerchief, and I found the duplicate of the watch upon her.

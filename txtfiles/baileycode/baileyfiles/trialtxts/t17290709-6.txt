             depos'd, That the Prisoners came to her Shop pretending to buy Lace, about 6 or 7 a-Clock in the Evening, and she measuring a Piece of Lace of about 10 Yards, Neal swore, Her Yard, by which she measur'd, was not a just Measure, and was very abusive; that upon this, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Budd 
               



             desir'd her not to take any Notice of what her Husband said, for he was drunk; and her (Mrs. Jennings's) Husband being a Dyer, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Budd 
               



             pull'd up the fore-part of her Petticoat, and threw it on the Counter, over some Lace, asking what he would have for Dying it? to which she reply'd, she did not know; that, upon this, they went immediately away, and she missing the Lace, sent her Maid after them.
The Maid depos'd, That the Prisoners came to her Master's Shop, and her Mistress crying out she was robb'd, she follow'd them, and upon her crying Stop Thief, they were both apprehended.

             depos'd, That upon the Out-cry of Stop Thief, he ran after 
               
                  Mary 
                  Budd 
               



            , and apprehended her, and Neal came up to her, and they jostling close up to one another, he parted them, and upon their being parted, the Lace lay on the Ground betwixt them, and he took it up; and Neal desiring to be let go, Budd bid him not, for he had the Lace in his Pocket; but this was before the dropping of it. There were several other Evidences to confirm those before-mentioned. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them guilty to the 


               Value of 4 s. 10 d. each
            .

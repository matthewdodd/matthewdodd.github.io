. On the 8th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner stoop down, put his hand inside the door, and take these glasses off a shelf behind the door. I went to the door, called Stop thief! and pursued him - he let them fall. Two officers secured him. I am sure he is the boy.

            . I belong to Bow-street. I saw the prosecutor pursuing the prisoner. I turned down Henry-street, and Plank seized him - he said,
"I am not the boy."

            . On the 8th of December I saw the prisoner running down the road. He threw something out of his hand, turned round, and I laid hold of him. He said,
"It was not me, I did not break the glasses."

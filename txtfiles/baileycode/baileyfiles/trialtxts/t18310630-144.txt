. I received information on the 24th of June, from SarahCole, and went into Long-lane; I saw Boulton running with something under his jacket - he turned round, and seeing me running after him, he gave the article he had to Ireland, who was running in the same direction - I collared Ireland. and found they were these trousers, which are my master's - I had seen them safe a minute before; Boulton came back of his own accord.

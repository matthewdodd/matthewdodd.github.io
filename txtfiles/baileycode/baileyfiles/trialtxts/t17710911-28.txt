            . Mr. Berridge and I keep a tavern

 at the back of the New Church in the Strand



. I was in the country at the time the said pepper box was lost.
- I am a servant to Mr. Berridge and Mr. Anderson; the prisoner came in on the 28th of August, about nine at night in a hurry, and asked for a room. I shewed him a room, he ordered a lamb's chop and a pint of wine; he asked for pen, ink and paper, and wrote a letter. I went for a porter for him. I laid the cloth, and carried in the pepper box; he staid about an hour; I saw him go out of the house and turn the corner, as he had not paid his reckoning; I followed him, and called stop thief; he was stopt and brought back again; he took the pepper box out of his pocket.

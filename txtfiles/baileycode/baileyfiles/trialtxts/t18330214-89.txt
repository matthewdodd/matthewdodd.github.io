ISAAC TWILLEY. I am steward and storekeeper to the 
               
Directors and Guardians of the poor of St. Mary-le-bone - their workhouse is in Northumberland-street








            ; the prisoner was clerk of the cheques
; we manufacture sacks among other articles - they are made by the poor, and sold for their maintenance; Mr. James Clark has sacks of us - he applied in the course of last year for a number of sacks; these cheques are the prisoner's hand-writing. - (read.)
Mr. Twilley, May 22, 1832. Deliver to James Clark 150 - 4 B. sacks.

I entered them in a book which I have here; as they stand now in the book - they are, "on May 22 1832, James Clark, 50 4 
               B. 
            sacks; on June 6, James Clark, 10 4 B. sacks; June 12, James Clark, 50 4 
               B. 
            sacks" - I cannot say that I entered them in his presence; I am certain that these are not as I entered them; there has been one hundred erased from each of these places; when I have matle entries in the book it is handed to the prisoner, and he posts it into the ledger, which I have here; it is entered in the ledger, in the prisoner's hand-writing, as it now stands in the journal, but it does not agree with the cheques nor with what I entered in the journal - this invoice is in the prisoner's hand-writing.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Is not Mr. Watts the superintendent of this work? A. He was formerly - he does not superintend the manufacturing department; he is the head of the whole establishment - the prisoner was employed there before me; in this entry there appears to have been an erasure before the word James - I do not know what that is; it might be there when I entered it - I make the entries in this book one day, and give it to the prisoner to post the next morning, about nine o'clock- he posts it, and returns it; no other person but the prisoner and me were employed in the writing department- the books are locked up at night in the store-room, and I kept the key.

            . I am a sack and bag maker. In Mand June last I dealt with Marylebone workhouse, for sacks and bags - this invoice was delivered to me for sacks and bags delivered from there; on the 22nd of May I am charged with one hundred and fifty sacks, 15l. - on the 6th of June one hundred and forty, and on the 12th of June one hundred and fifty; the amount of the whole bill is 111l. 13s. 2d.; I gave the prisoner this cheque of my own, and on the 27th of August I gave him this other, which I had received.

Our half years account to Midsummer last was 23l., which I paid the prisoner at my counting-house, on the 14th of August, 1832; this is his receipt - he wrote it in my presence.

            . This is my cash-book - it is the prisoner's duty to account to me for cash he receives the same day he received it; on the 18th of July I received of him 46l. 2s. 3d., on account of Mr. Clark, and the cheque he received was 55l. 17s. 2d.; on the 29th of August, I received 45l. 16s., and the cheque is 55l. 16s., and on account of Mr. Vane I received 17l. 12s., and Mr. Vane paid him 23l. - I made these entries in the cash-book in the prisoner's presence, and he paid me no more than is here put down.

            ; we are stationers; we had a customer of the name of Butcher, at Tring - on the 21st of August we received a letter bearing the Tring post-mark, and purporting to come from Mr. Butcher; I attended at the office when the prisoner was apprehended - the Magistrate asked him what he had to say; he said, "Your worship, I acknowledge I wrote the letters, and received the goods; I wish to give these gentleman no more trouble than is necessary;" - in consequence of the receipt of the letter, the goods mentioned in it were packed up; the value of the whole was Â£5. 17s. 2d.; they were packed up in a square brown paper parcel -I directed the parcel for Mr. 
               C. 
            Woodman, by Salmon's Barnet coach, to be left at the office till called for; that was agreeable to the order - I delivered it to Webb to take to the office - the letter came through the General Post delivery - on the 30th of September we received another letter by the twopenny post, which purports to come from 
               
                  Charles 
                  Woodman
               



            ; this is it.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You received the first letter by post? A. Yes - I do not know that it came into my hands; I found it on the desk - we had dealt with Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Butcher

             was unknown to me - it was on Friday, the 1st of October, the prisoner acknowledged having written these letters; I think I was the only person in the office besides the officer - I am sure he said it was his own hand-writing; he said, "I acknowledge to have written the letter and received the goods; I wish to give these gentlemen no more trouble than is necessary;" this wasnot taken down - the 

Magistrate's clerk told me the prisoner's confession went for nothing in that case; what I said was taken down.

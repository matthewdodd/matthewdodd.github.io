ELIZABETH BLACKLOCK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of September, 2 caps, value 1s.; 1 shift, value 1s.; 1 shift, value 8s.; 1 pair of bellows, value 1s. 6d.; 3 plates, value 4d.; and 3 spoons, value 4d.; the goods of 



William Scholey; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






CATHERINE SCHOLEY
. I am the wife of William Scholey, a milkman, of Little Saffron-hill. On the 22nd of September, the prisoner came into my house, at twenty minutes after nine and stopped until eleven o'clock, and then I said, "Ann, I am going to shut my door, and go out"—she said she would do some needle-work for me—I left her there, and when I returned, at twenty-five minutes after twelve o'clock, I found the door open, and missed all these things, except the spoons, which I missed in the afternoon—they are worth 12s. 6d. altogether—I had to make good a shirt which I had to make, which came to 7s. 11d.—I went to the station-house and reported her, and described her dress; and on the Monday morning following, the policeman took her, and she had my cap on then—I told her if she would make my things good she should go about her business—she said, "Wait, you 'll get them"—I said, "Tell me where the shirt and bellows are, I will let you go"—she said, "Wait, you'll get them," and at Hatton-garden I gave her the same chance, but she never told me where they were—I had let her sleep with me, about twelve months ago, for three weeks—she has no parents.





WILLIAM BRADLEY
 (police-constable G 165.) I took the prisoner into custody, and took her to the station-house—this cap was on her head.





JOHN KERSHAW
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was present when she was tried, and know her to be the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—

Transported for Seven Years.

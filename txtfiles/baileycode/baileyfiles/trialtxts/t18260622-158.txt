            . On the 1st of June, I saw the prisoner in Cannonbury fields, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Walder's house, with this linen in a bundle, which he dropped the moment he saw me, and ran away - I pursued and took him. I am sure he is the man. I took up the bundle and gave it to Thomas Carter.

            . I saw the prisoner running, and joined in the pursuit. I am sure he is the man who was running - I told him to get up - he pretended to be asleep among the nettles - I took him by the collar - he rubbed his eyes, and asked what was the matter - I said "You have been stealing." The officer came and took him.
WILLIAM WALDER. I am a coach-master
, and live at Islington. This property is mine - it was in my coach-house - some part was wet and some dry - they were washing that day - the coach-house doors, where the property hung, were pushed to - the washerwoman was gone up stairs - I had seen the clothes safe at half-past eleven o'clock - they were taken a quarter before one.

WILLIAM ARNOLD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of August, 1 gelding, 2l. 7s., the property of 



John Gore.






JOHN GORE
. I am a dust contractor—I lost a gelding, on the 4th of August, from a little field which 1 hire, near Paddington—I have seen it since—it is mine—the prisoner was in my service occasionally, for six or seven years; he left me seven months ago.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How long bad you had it? A. About fifteen months—it was very lame—it went out with the dustcart—he had a bad foot, and I put him in the field to rest him—he was worth but little.





JAMES SMITH
. I turned the horse into the field on Sunday—I missed him on Thursday morning, the 5th of August—I have seen it since at Sewell's—it is my master's.

Cross-examined. Q. Was there any gate to the field? A. Yes; it was shut to, but not locked—I am sure I shut it—I saw it last safe on Tuesday afternoon—I know him by his lame foot, and am sure of it.





HENRY SEWELL
. I bought this horse of the prisoner for 2l. 7s.; he said it was his; it was found with me.

Cross-examined. Q. How came you to go to Clerkenwell-green? A. Burridge came to me, and I went with him—the bargain took about twenty minutes—I took particular notice of the prisoner—it was the full value for the horse—we slaughter horses.





JAMES BURRIDGE
.—I was present when the horse was sold by the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you fetch Sewell? A. Yes; I first saw the horse on the 4th—the prisoner and another man was leading it—the prisoner was helping it on with a stick.

Prisoner's Defence. Two men asked me to sell it for them.
(John Buck, excavator, Earl-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Ten Years.

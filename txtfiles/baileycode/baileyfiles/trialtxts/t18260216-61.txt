            . I live opposite to Mr. Gebhard, a cabinet-maker
, in the Commercial-road. Between nine and ten o'clock in the morning of the 1st of February, I saw the prisoner go into his shop, and take a pair of bedsteps from about two yards with in the shop; he went down Morgan-street; I pursued and overtook him about thirty yards down the street; I told him he had better take them back; he said he should not; I collared him, and told him he should go back.

            . I am in the employ of John Gebhard. These steps are his property; they were about two yards within his shop. On the 1st of February the prisoner was brought back with them; he was quite a stranger, and had not bought them - I was at breakfast when they were taken.

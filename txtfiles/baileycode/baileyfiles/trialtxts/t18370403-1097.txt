STEPHEN FIELD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of April, 1 hat, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



Morris Moss.






JAMES MONTIER
. I am a farrier. I saw two boys at the Colonnade, in Russell-square, on the 6th of April, from five to six o'clock—I cannot swear to the prisoner; if he is the boy he has not the same countenance—one of them took this hat, and carried it before him into Russell-square—he dropped it on the other side of a cart, and ran into Bedford-place—in my attempting to follow him I slipped—I caught the boy that took the hat—I have no doubt of that, and I gave him to the policeman—I never gave any other boy to the policeman—I cannot say whether he had a cap on or not—no one has been speaking to me about this—I made this mark at the office to this deposition—that is what I swore before the Magistrate—it was read over to me I believe—I have no doubt what I swore was true—(read)—"I was in the Colonnade this afternoon, and saw the prisoner take the hat from the stall in front of the prosecutor's, and ran away with it".





ROBERT LAY
 (police-constable E 44.) The prisoner was given into my custody by James Montier, in Russell-square—he had a blue cap on—this is the hat.





MORRIS MOSS
. I keep a stall under the stand. I did not miss the hat before the prisoner was brought back—this is my hat—the prisoner is the same boy that was brought back, but be looks different from having that cap on—(the prisoner had a while night-cap on.)

            . I am warehouseman
 at Morrison and Co.'s, Fore-street. I met the prisoner in the street at ten o'clock on the night of the 7th of March; I did not go with her to any public-house I am sure - I was not sober; I do not know whether she did any thing to me, but I felt my pocket lightened a little - I had changed a sovereign at Temple-bar, and had walked from there till I met her; I believe she put her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and I dare say she might into other pockets - she scuffled me about a good deal; I do not recollect her putting her hand into my trousers pocket - I do into my waistcoat pocket, where part of my change was, and part in my trousers; I missed some money from my waistcoat and some from my trousers - she was taken to the watch-house by a person; it was not by my desire; I said I was robbed; I did not drink any gin with her - I had none after I left Temple-bar.

COURT. Q. You said at the office that you did not know whether you spoke to her or she to you? A. No, I do not know.
COURT. Q. You said, "I felt her put her hand into my trousers pocket and take out my money," is that true? A. I recollect her putting her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and I missed some silver from my trousers pocket.

            . I was in Whitecross-street


, and saw the prisoner take the prosecutor by the arm; she went up the street, and when she saw the Police she took him across the road - she went in front of him, put her two arms on his shoulders, and pressed him to cross the road, which he did; she took him across the road again, placed him against a door, put her two hands into his waistcoat pockets, and then her right hand into his trousers pocket; she then put her hand into his waistcoat pocket again - I saw the Policeman coming up, and gave charge of her; I saw her searched, and 17s. was found on her - the prosecutor was very much intoxicated; not at all sensible.

            . I am a Police-constable. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together, as I passed down Golden-lane; they crossed over before I got to them - I went to disperse some girls, saw them again, and the prisoner had her hand in the prosecutor's pocket; I asked her if he was her husband - she said No; I asked if she knew where he lived - she said near Old-street; I said "You had better see him home;" the prosecutor then said he had been robbed of nearly 1l. - the prisoner said, "He has been robbed of all he has but this 6d., which I am going to get some gin with, and you may have some if you like;" I took the 6d. from her, and took her to the station - I asked what money she had; she said 15s. or 16s. - I took 15s. in silver and 5 3/4d. in copper, from her, and the 6d. which I had before; this was at a quarter before twelve o'clock.

            . My father keeps the Green Man, Shipyard, Temple-bar. The prosecutor received change for a sovereign of me that Sunday evening; I gave him the full change - he said he wanted to give 2s. 6d. to a subscription; this was between nine and ten o'clock - he was drunk.
Prisoner's Defence. I left the prosecutor standing against a window-shutter; he called after me, and said,"Will you see me part of the way home?" I said, "Where do you live?" he said in Old-street - I said I would; we then went to a public-house, and had some gin - we then went to the Cat, and he treated me again to another quartern of gin; he then said he had lost a sovereign, and then 1l. worth of silver - on the Saturday morning I had changed a sovereign, and had 15s. 6d. and some halfpence in my pocket.
ROBERT RANSON. I inquired at the Cat, and she had not been there - she had been at Mr. Wingfield's.

             sworn.
The 10th of May about a quarter past eleven, this man passed me in the street, I am a patrol, and looking after him I saw he had something heavy, I pursued him, and he mended his pace, as I was coming up to lay hold of him he threw the lead down, I sprung my rattle, and he was taken.
Was he ever out of your sight? - No, I am sure he was the man I first saw with the lead upon his shoulders.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going from New Prison, Clerkenwell, with a letter, into Cavendish-street, and one of the watchmen stopped me; I saw a man on the highway.

On the 25th of August last, between six and seven in the morning, I was going to work, and I saw the prisoner, Teasdale, coming from the prosecutor's with a saucepan in his hand; he said, he was going to get it tinned; I took him back; and saw the prisoner, Walters, ascending out of the prosecutor's area, climbing over the rails; I took the prisoners into custody.

I stopped Walters, and saw Teasdale in custody of Hammond, with a saucepan; and I saw another saucepan in the area, with a string fastened to it, and to the rails; I drew it up, and Walters was stopped, and a bird was found in his breeches.

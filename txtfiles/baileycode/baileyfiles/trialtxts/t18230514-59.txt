             was indicted for

                        John 
                        Martin
                     



.
MESSRS. BOLLAND and BERNARD conducted the prosecution.
MR. JOHN FINCH, produced the office copy of the conviction of Robert and 
               
                  John 
                  Martin
               



            .


                  JOHN 
                  BLADES
               



            . I am an officer of this Court. I was present at the trial of Robert and 
               
                  John 
                  Martin
               



            , and recollect the prisoner tendering himself as a witness for the prisoners. I swore him upon the New Testament.


                  HENRY 
                  BUCKLER
               



            , short hand writer, read the evidence given by the prisoner on the 19th of April
, on behalf of 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



            , in which he deposed among other things as follows:-" Q. Where do you live? A. In Long-acre, No. 17, - I lodge there on the second floor. Hollingsworth keeps the house. On the 20th of February last, about two minutes before six o'clock, I was coming down Crown-street, Soho, and a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had any commands to Liverpool, he would take them - I told him No. I do not know his name - he was going to Ireland that way. I had seen him once or twice only. We stood in conversation in the street, opposite Mr. Martin's door; our conversation lasted upwards of twelve or fourteen minutes, as near as I can recollect, during which time I saw 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             twice or thrice at the door and inside the shop. Immediately after the gentleman and I separated it struck a quarter past six o'clock - and I have nothing further to say. Q. How long have you lodged in Long-acre? A. Six or seven months." See Fourth Session, Page 250.


                  WILLIAM 
                  HUXTABLE
               



            . I live in King-street, Holborn; but my business is carried on in Theobald's-road. We place the candles out to cool in the street. On the 20th of February, there were some candles put out to cool. I was at my house in King-street, on the 20th of February, when 
               
                  James 
                  Adamson
               



             gave me information - it was then certainly not more then ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock; I think it might be twenty minutes past six. Thirty-six candles were in three mould frames which were stolen.


                  JAMES 
                  ADAMSON
               



            . I live with Mr. Huxtable. On the 20th of February, some moulds were out in the street with candles in them. I missed three frames about six o'clock in the evening. I saw them safe at twenty minutes before I gave information to Mr. Huxtable.


                  WILLIAM 
                  TOURNAY
               



            . I am in the service of Mr. Huxtable. On the 20th of February, there were some moulds put to cool in the street - I saw them safe about a quarter to six o'clock, and missed them about twenty minutes past six o'clock. Three were stolen.


                  RICHARD 
                  GILBERT
               



            . At the time in question, I lived in Norfolk-street, Middlesex-hospital. On the evening of the 20th of February, I was returning home through Theobald's-road, about a quarter past six o'clock; it was a fair night - the gas was lighted. At the corner of Harper-street, I saw two men with mould frames on their shoulders - 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             was one of them; I had an opportunity of seeing them. I followed them to the end of Harper-street, when they were overtaken by a third man, who also had a frame on his shoulder. I followed them across Queen-square, through a court into Southampton-row, into Great Russell-street, and Charlotte-street, across through Middle-row, in Monmouth-street, to No. 25, Crown-street, Soho - the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Martin
               



             was over the door; it was then about half-past six o'clock. They all three put the frames into the shop. I gave information, and accompained the officers next day to Martin's house - the candles were found; 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             was there. I said in his bearing, I had no doubt that was the man who brought the candles; he said nothing. They took him into custody. We found thirty-six candles, and some bits of wood marked with tallow. One of the three men came out of the house, and said to the others,
"D - n your eyes look sharp." I have not the least doubt of Robert being theman who ran away with the candles. I saw his face all the way.


                  RICHARD 
                  MILLS
               



            . I live at No. 17, Long-acre. I have lived there a year and three quarters. The prisoner has not lived there since I kept the house; he is a perfect stranger. I have three lodgers. I had two on the 19th of April; one Gilks lived there before me. I never knew Hollingsworth. I have a lease of the house.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  HUGHES
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Mills, and was so in April last. I never saw the prisoner before, he did not live at the house on the 19th of April; I came into Mr. Mills's service, about a month after he came to the house.


                  JOHN 
                  WEAVER
               



            . I lodge at Mr. Mills's house, No. 17, Long-acre. I have lived there nearly four years. I never saw the prisoner before to day; he did not live there on the 19th of April, or at any time. Gilks was the landlord before Mills came. I never knew Hollingsworth.


                  THOMAS 
                  FORD
               



            . I am an officer. I went to the house of 
               
                  John 
                  Martin
               



            , on the 21st of February, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, with a search warrant. Mr. Huxtable, was with me. We found thirty-six mould candles in a bag, concealed in a back out-house, and some solder melted down; also some small pieces of wood with tallow on them; they appeared part of mould frames; there were marks of these having been chopped up on the threshold of the door. Martin was a dealer in marine stores.


                  RICHARD 
                  SEEKINS
               



            . I am a mould-maker for tallow chandlers, and saw some pieces of the frames of moulds, produced on Martin's trial. I manufactured one of the frames. I selected twelve of the candles, which were made in my mould - the pieces of wood appeared to be part of mould frames, and some were greasy.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he came into Court, to speak the truth and nothing but the truth, but that the multiplicity of questions put to him, so excedingly agitated him, that he did not doubt he had contradicted himself, but not wilfully.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 31.




               Confined Six Months
            , and then 


               Transported for Seven Years
            .

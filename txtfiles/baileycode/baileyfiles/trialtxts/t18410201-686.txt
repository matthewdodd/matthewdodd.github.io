SARAH NEALE
. I am single, and live with Mrs. Traylors, at Hanwel—Imissed a pair of stockings off the line by the side of the house—these are them—I know nothing of the prisoner.





CHARLES MILES
. I live at Hanwell. On the 20th of January, at ten o'clock at night, I saw the stockings hanging up in the yard, in an outshed, where I keep tools—in the morning it was broken open, but I missed nothing from there—there were footmarks on the snow, which were afterwards compared with the prisoner's shoes, and they corresponded in every particular—he lives at Southall.





JOHN DENTON
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and found this pair of stockings on him—I matched the prisoner's shoes to the foot-marks, and they tallied exactly.

Prisoners Defence. I found the stockings lying in a ditch by the side of the road, about two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's.

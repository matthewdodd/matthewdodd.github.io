            . About one o'clock in the morning of the day in the indictment, as I was returning home, I fell down crossing Ratcliffe Highway


. At the moment, the prisoner and another man came over, and were in the act of helping me up. The prisoner put his hand to my breeches, and I thought there was something wrong; I told him not to rob me; and he laid hold of the chain and seal, and made a catch, and drew the watch out of my pocket; he broke the bow of the watch with the snatch, and ran down the hill with the watch.

            . I am a watchman. I was coming along, and heard a man halloo out stop thief, and I saw the prisoner coming towards me, and I caught him. When I was bringing him along, he put his hand towards the wall, and I found the watch on the ledge of the wall where I stopped him.

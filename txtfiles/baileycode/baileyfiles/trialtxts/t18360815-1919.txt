JOSHUA GEORGE
. I am assistant to Mr. James West, of Shoreditch, a linen-draper. On the 20th of July, about twelve o'clock in the day, I observed the prisoners looking in at the shop-window—I am sure they are the persons—I saw Donovan come into the lobby of the shop-door, and take four lengths of print, take them to the corner of the window, and put them into Beedham's apron—I went out—they saw me, and one ran one way, and the other the other—I pursued Beedham—he threw it down—I saw a young man pick it up—this is it—the prisoners were secured.

Donovan. I was at home, going to bed—this gentleman came and told me I must get up, which I did.

Beedham. I was going home—that gentleman came and took me, and said that he saw me drop this property.

DONOVAN—


GUILTY
.* Aged 12.

BEEDHAM—

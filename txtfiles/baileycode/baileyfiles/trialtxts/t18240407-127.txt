            . I am a bookseller
, and live in High Holborn


. On the 17th of March, I was in my shop serving a customer - Resbrook brought the prisoner in, and charged him with taking these books from the door, which he denied.

            . I am a gun-maker, and work next door to the prosecutor's. On the 17th of March, I was shutting up my master's shop, and saw the prisoner take five books from Mr. Doyle's door. I went and collared him, he dropped them, he had put them under his arm, and had gone twelve or fourteen yards with them. I am sure he is the man - I did not take my eye off him.

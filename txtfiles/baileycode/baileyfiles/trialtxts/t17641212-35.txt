            ; the prisoner came to my room on Friday last, where I live, in Great Wild-street


; when she was gone, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I made the best enquiry for her I could, and found her in Newtner's-lane; when she saw me, she ran; but I got hold of her, and got a proper officer, and got her into the round-house, and she was examined before the Justice; she had the shoes, stockings, and shirt on, which she delivered up, and told where she had pledged the other things, and went with the constable and me to the Three Golden Balls, St. Martin's lane; we found the petticoat, handkerchief, and stays, put up in the tablecloth.
Thomas Hall. I am a pawnbroker, and live in St. Martin's-lane; I took in this petticoat, pair of stays, and handkerchief, of the prisoner at the bar, on the 6th of December. (Produced and deposed to).
Prisoner's Defence.
I never did any thing before; I had buried my mother about three months before, and I was in great distress.

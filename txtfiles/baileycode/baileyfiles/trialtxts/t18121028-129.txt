Q. On the 25th of July last, where were you - A. About half after two in the afternoon I was going down to the lower end of Saffron-hill. I was by myself. I saw two men go into Mrs. Broadfield's house, or Gilingham's house. It goes by both names. I saw two men go into her house in Field-lane They were together. I stopped until they got into the house, and then I went after them. I went into the back room. They were standing by a table, and the coats were laying on the table, and Mrs. Broadfield was looking at them.
Q. Were there any other man there - A, No, none but the two which I saw go in with this bundle. Mrs. Broadfield was looking at the coats on the table.
Q. Were those the coats that were sworn to upon the trial of Kennedy - A. Yes. I asked Mrs. Broadfield, or whatever her name is, who brought the coat there.
Q. Where was the prisoner - A. Why, she was at the outside door, and this was in the inner room.
Q. Did you learn from her wether she belonged to the house, or not - A. I knew she did; she acted as servant in that house. I took the two men in custody. They were fighting and strugling with me. I called to a man standing at the door to come and help me. This

JOSEPH STEFFANONI. I am an upholsterer
, and live at Holborn-bars. On the 18th of July I was near Red Lion-street


; I felt a hand in my coat pocket - I turned, and took hold of the prisoner; I charged him with stealing my snuffbox, which I had just missed; he said he had not got it, but he put his hand behind him, and threw the box into the middle of Holborn.
Prisoner. There were three or four more persons there. Witness. I did not see them; I believe there was one more, but I am certain the prisoner threw it.

THOMAS BUTTRESS (Police-constable E 142.) I took the prisoner, and have the box.

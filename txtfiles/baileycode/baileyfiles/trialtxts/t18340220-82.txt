AUGUSTINE GAVILLER. I live at Lower Clapton - on the 20th of January I was in Smithfield


, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and felt a sudden pull at my coat pocket behind - I instantly turned round, and perceived my handkerchief in the hands of the prisoner - he was thrusting it into his breast - I put my hand in my pocket, and missed it at the same time - I instantly collared him,and dragged him under a gateway, and held him till the policeman came to my assistance - he had it in his hand when I seized him.
Prisoner. I was looking for my father - I saw the gentleman's handkerchief on the road, took it up, walked towards the gentleman, and said, "Sir, is this your handkerchief?" - he collared me immediately.
Witness. He did not say a word of the kind - I know it was in my pocket five minutes before - there was another one with him, I believe, but I cannot be certain he was in his company.

THOMAS BRZEDON
. I am a wheelwright, and live in Type-street Chiswell-street. I have known the prisoner, by his coining for trucks, for many months—on Monday, the 29th of January, about three o'clock, he came and said he wanted a truck for Mr. Poole, and I let him have one—I am positive he is the man—he was to bring it back in the course of the day—he hired it for two or three hours, at 3d. an hour.





CLEMENT POOLE
. The prisoner was formerly in my son's employ—I reside in the country, but was with my son on the day in question—I did not direct the prisoner to get a truck for me—if there had been any brought I should have seen it—there was none brought.





THOMAS' BEALE
. I live in Lower-street, Whitechapel. On the 29th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house, and said he was going to be seized on, and had got a truck to sell cheap—I went with him to Whitecross-street—he there left me, saying he would go and see if the man was at home who had got it—be brought it to me, and I bought it of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.) Prisoner. I am very sorry for it.




GUILTY
.* Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a publican. On the 15th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Down-street, Piccadilly, and met the prisoner; a boy was accusing her of stealing pots; I asked her if she had any of mine - She said she had not; I let her go - A man said she had some under her arm; I followed her to the mews, and saw her throw a pint pot away. I found a funnel and a pint pot on her, and a quart pot in a milk-pan, which she had.

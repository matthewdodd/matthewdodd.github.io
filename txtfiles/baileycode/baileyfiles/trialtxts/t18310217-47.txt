            . Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of January, I was in Regent-street


, and distinctly felt a pull at my pocket, by which my handkerchief was extracted - I turned, and saw it in the possession of the prisoner; he dropped it - I took it up, and gave him to an officer; there was another boy near me, who I think was an accomplice, but I cannot be positive.

            . I watched the prisoner and another following a gentleman all the way up Regent-street - they then left him, and followed this gentleman down Regent-street - I followed them, and saw them give a tug at his pocket; he took no notice of that, but went into a shop - they waited till he came out, and followed him again till a cart passed by on that side, and then they made the draw so that I could not see the handkerchief come from the pocket, but I had seen them make two different attempts at the pocket - I took the prisoner, and the other ran away, but I knew him, and where he lived; I went and took him about three quarters of an hour afterwards, but the bill against him was thrown out.

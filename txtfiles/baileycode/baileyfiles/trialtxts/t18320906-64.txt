            . I am constable of Staines


. On the 31st of August I saw the two prisoners, and watched them for nearly half an hour; I saw them go to Mr. Jones' shop, who is a linen-draper
 - Brentley first tried to get down a pair of breeches, and then he went into the passage, and hooked off a jacket with this stick; he gave it to Williams, and I took him with the jacket - Brentley ran off, but was afterwards taken; this is the jacket.

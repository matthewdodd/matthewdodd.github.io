             a tallow-chandler, came about 4 in the afternoon, and said, the prisoner had brought some sheep's fat to his house: I sent her there for some candles, and then went and got there before her. When she came in Mrs. Hill said, that was the person that brought the fat there, it was lying then in the scale (the fat of two sheeps kidneys) 5 pounds and 3 quarters of it; I took the prisoner home; she confest she had taken it, and begged I would pass it by and overlook it. She was committed; after which she sent me this letter, (produced in court.) She owned before the Alderman afterwards she sent it.
It was read in court, wherein she acknowledged the fact and begged mercy.

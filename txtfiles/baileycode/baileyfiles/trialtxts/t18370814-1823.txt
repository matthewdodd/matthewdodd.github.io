ELIZABETH GRANT
. I am the wife of William Grant, of No. 17, Bernard Mews, Marylebone. I take in washing—I lost all these things on the 6th of July—they were all wet, and lost out of the tub—they are my property.





WILLIAM GRANGE
. I live next door to Elizabeth Grant. About four o'clock in the morning of the 6th of July, I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's house, and go in again—in five minutes he brought out bundle and a pair of tongs—I saw some water dripping from the bundle I had him taken, and he had these things on him.

Prisoner. Q. Was it No. 16 or 17 you saw me come out of? A. No. 17.

Prisoner. I slept at No. 16, and came out of that house—and as I came out I met a man, who asked me to carry a bundle to No. 31, Well-street, and he would come after me—I went on, and this man came and said I had got his things—I said I would go to the place—I took them to No. 31, and put them down—then the officer came and took me, and I was taken to the station—the prosecutor stated that the doors were fastened, and I had nothing on me to open a door with—I had nothing but a knife and a key.

Witness. I saw him opening the bundle and examining every at the door of No. 31, Well-street.





WILLIAM SELF
 (police-constable E 126.) I took the prisoner in charge.

Prisoner. Did I not put it down at the door, and you said "Take it up again?" Witness. You had put it down—I did not see you look at the things—the linen was hot and wet out of the copper or tub.
(John Bradbury gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 50.—


Transported for Seven Years.

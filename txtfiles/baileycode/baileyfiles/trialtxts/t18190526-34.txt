            . On the 4th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I was crossing Smithfield


, and met the prisoner, she asked me to go home with her - I refused; we had then got to the middle of the sheep-pens - she ran her hand into my breeches-pocket, in which I had five shillings, two half-crowns, and a sixpence; I felt her hand leaving my pocket, and by the light of the moon I saw the half-crowns in her hand - she ran into the sheep-pens, and shut the gates; I at last secured her, and missed two half-crowns. She said she would give me the money, she however did not. I called the watchman, and gave her in charge. The money was found on her.

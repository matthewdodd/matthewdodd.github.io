RICHARD HUTCHINGS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 sail, value 10s.; the goods of 



Thomas Crisp and another: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS CRISP
. I am a shipwright, and live in Mill-street, Bermondsey—I have one partner—this sail was lent to me by a gentleman, and was in my custody—I saw it safe at six o'clock in the evening on the 17th of Oct.—the following morning the officer called on me before I was up, to know if I had lost a sail—I got up, and missed it—this is it—I know it by the name of the vessel being on it.






DANIEL MILLS
 (police-constable M 173.) On the evening of the 17th of Oct. I was on duty in Mill-street, about half-past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner walking with a man of the name of Cole—the prisoner had some-thing on his back—when he came near me I crossed the road to stop him—he threw down what he had and ran away—the other man had run away before—I pursued the prisoner—he got ground of me—I turned back, and found this sail—I knew the prisoner well—I am positive it was. him—he was right under a lamp—this is the sail the prosecutor identified—the prisoner was taken last Wednesday morning by an officer—he has been out of sight ever since I stopped him.

Prisoner, Q. What time was it? A. Half-past eight in the evening—I am sure it was you—you were on one side, and I on the other—it is not above five paces across the road—I pursued you, but you ran too fast for me.

COURT. Q. Was there any light? A. Yes, a gas-light right at the corner of the turning he ran down.

Prisoner's Defence. I know no more about it than you do; I have not been out of the way to hide myself.





WILLIAM NOAKES
 (police-constable M 104.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted the 16th of June, 1845, and confined twelve months)—I was present—he is the person.

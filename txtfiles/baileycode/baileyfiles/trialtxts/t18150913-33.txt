                  , from his person

CHRISTOPHER M'CARTNEY. I am a seafaring man
, and on the 15th of July, I happened to be in the Catherine Wheel public-house, in Whitechapel


, and there I fell in with the prisoners at the bar. I had twenty-two pounds in English notes in a pocketbook. I was drinking with the prisoners in the tap-room; I was perfectly sober, and having fallen off the Portsmouth coach coming to London, I was not able to look out for a bed for myself, so I said, I would thank any one to help me to a bed;

             told me she would help me to a bed, which she did, and not being able to strip myself, laid down with my clothes on, and soon after, the other prisoner, Maria, came up. I fell asleep, and they remained in the room. My money was safe then in a pocket-book, which was in a sort of belt round my body. I was awakened by the prisoners rummaging my clothes about, and then I perceived they had got the pocket-book. I saw Elizabeth take the notes out of it: then she threw the pocket-book at me, and then they both ran down stairs. I picked the pocket-book up, but it was empty. I then went down stairs, and to the place where I first fell in with them, but could learn no tidings of them. At last, I fell in with them at the Kettle Drum, in Ratcliffe Highway, and I immediately procured an officer, and had them taken into custody. I am sure I had four notes for the payment of five pounds each, and two for the payment of one pound each.

            . I keep the Rose and Crown public-house in Essex-street. The two prisoners came into my house on the morning of the 16th of July, and Maria gave me two notes, asking me at the same time, whether they were two one-pound notes or two two-pound notes, and I told her they were five-pound notes; I don't know what became of them, they paid me three shillings and sixpence, which they owed me, and they told me if any one enquired for them, I was to say I had not seen them, and I said, very well.

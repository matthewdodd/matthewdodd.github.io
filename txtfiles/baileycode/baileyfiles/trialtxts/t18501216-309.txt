THOMAS FORREST



, stealing 8 yards of calico, value 2s.; the goods of 



Benjamin Wellington: having been before convicted.






BENJAMIN WELLINGTON
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Parker's-row, Dock-head, Bermondsey. On 10th Dec. I had eight yards of calico hanging just inside my door—I saw it safe at two o'clock, and missed it about five.





RICHARD PRIGMORE
. I work at a butter-shop, near Mr. Wellington's. On 10th Dec. I observed some persons at his shop-door; the prisoner was one of them, he used to go to school with me—there were two others with him at the door—I saw the prisoner step inside the door, and take the calico down; he put it under his feet—one of his companions took it up, and ran away—I gave information directly.

Prisoner. The shop-door is round the corner; if I had gone in, he would have had to have seen through the other shop.





CHARLES PHILLIPS
 (policeman, M 275). I apprehended the prisoner in Sugar Loaf-court, Dock-head—I know the prosecutor's shop-door—from where Prigmore was, he could see the prosecutor's house.





PHILIP FROND
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at this court—(read—Convicted on his own confession, Aug., 1848, and confined nine months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a silver castor
, and live in Racquet Court, Fleet Street


; my house was broke open on Tuesday night the 14th of April
 or Wednesday morning; it was in the night. The door from a back house which entered into my shop, was broke open; it was bolted with two bolts, when I went to bed; at half after nine o'clock I saw it fastened myself; about seven o'clock in the morning, I went into that part of the house, the first in the family; others of the family were up before; but I was the first that went in there. I saw my door lay flat; it was taken off the hinges, with some chissels, which the men found, who took the prisoners up. I lost a quantity of silver dollars, half and quarter dollars, to the weight of 300 oz. in the whole; they were in a bowl behind the counter in the shop. I lost part of a skillet of silver, the weight was about 44 oz. that was in another bowl, just by the side of the dollars; a pair of silver shoe buckles set with chrystals, a gold ring set with coloured paste; the ring was in the till, the buckles in another drawer. I lost about 25 oz. of silver cast work, as near as I can guess.
Q. To what amount?
Faulconer. To about 200 l. in all; there are some things that I have not mentioned in the indictment. I have recovered some triffles. The prisoners were taken up about ten days after, and I saw them at Sir

                   Heley
               



             and I, went and broke open one of their chests, where we found some of my things; the father of one of them, told us that the chest belonged to them both; it was where they both kept their cloaths. It was in a court in Black Friars.
Q. I suppose you can't, from your own knowledge, say it was their lodging?
Faulconer. No.

                   Heley
               



             (produced a pair of shoe buckles set with stone, a cross, 69 oz. of silver melted down and a piece of a silver skillet.) I have had them ever since in my custody.
Faulconer. I know these buckles are my property. I cannot swear to the plate; it was melted down, from what it was before; this little bit of the skillet I can sware to, they have broke it; by comparing it with the other part it just matches, with two other pieces that were stopped by 
               
                  Wm.
                   Holmes

                   Holmes
               



            . These pieces of skillet (producing them) were delivered me by my apprentice, 
               
                  David
                   Jones
               



             the evidence. (The bit is put in between two pieces that were broke, and it sits exactly;) here is 118 oz. of silver.


                  John
                   Heley
               



            . I was present with Mr. Faulkner when we broke open a box belonging to the prisoners, and found these things on Friday night, between nine and ten o'clock. Mr. Holmes came up to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, he desired I would take Jones into custody, and examine him, touching the silver: as we were going along, he said it came out of Mr. Faulkner's house, in Racquet-Court, and said I was stolen by the prisoners; he said if we did not go very early they would be off. We went last Saturday sevennight; Jones, and I, and one Mr. Clarke, to the prisoner's lodgings, and found them both together. I laid hold of West, and searched him, I found upon him two quarters of a dollar, and a silver cross; I saw Mr. Clarke search the other, and take a ring out of his pocket. Jones had informed me they had a great chissel, I asked West where it was; he said he had no chissel but one, which a carpenter had left that had been repairing the house. I went into the garret and found these two chissels, (producing a large and a small chissel) we put them into a coach, and acquainted Mr. Faulconer with what had been done. Faulconer, I, and 
               
                  David
                   Jones
               



            , went back to the house; I asked the mother where her son's box was, she said in the garret, it is on the side of the garret where they work.
Q. What trade does he work at?
Heley. I think a fan-stick maker; we went into the garret, there we opened a box, in which we found the buckles, the little piece of the skillet, and two lamps, melted silver.


                  John
                   Clark
               



            . Mr. Heley called me up last Saturday was a week, I went with him and Jones to Black-Fryars; we found the prisoners at breakfast, in the one pair of stairs room; I searched Lucas, and found 8 dollars, and 5 quarters. Jones said, as we were going to Black-Fryars, that there was a bad half-guinea in one of their pockets, which was taken at the time of the robbery, we found the bad half-guinea on Lucas, and in the same piece of paper was found this ring; and we found those things at the lodging.
Faulconer. I can swear that this ring was in my till, for the night before the ring came from the East-Indies with the buckles, by a friend of mine, who is in court, and can swear it.
Clark produces the pieces of cast silver, &c he found in Lucas's pocket.
Faulconer. I know the cast silve r to be my property, the dollars are of the same sort as mine were.

                   Holmes
               



            . I had the two pieces of skellet from the evidence,

                   Jones
               



            ; I had them after 9 o'clock; I went immediately and made the information; I had this piece of 118 oz. before the skillet; I had missed silver, in my way for these 3 years, but never could find out who stole it; this piece, I found by 
               
                  David
                   Jones
               



            , belonged to Mr. Faulconer.

                   Jones
               



            . I was out with Lucas one Sunday, about a fortnight before Easter, when he told me he was tired of picking pockets, and asked me if I knew any house for them to break open. West was not with him at that time.
Q. Were you out then picking of pockets?
Jones. No; he was not out picking pockets then, he only said he was tired of picking pockets, and asked me if I would go a housebreaking with him, and if I knew of ever a place; I said I knew of Mr. Faulconer's; we all agreed to go and break it open on Saturday; we met West after, when he agreed to it; that was some time in the next week; we agreed to break it open on the Saturday, but they went and broke it open on Tuesday, unknown to me, as they informed me on Thursday following; when I saw them they said they had done it, and told me they had got this quantity of plate by them. They desired me to melt down the silver the first opportunity, I agreed to it. Last Friday week I thought I had an opportunity to melt it down, I went and told them, and they brought it to me; I was told there was 164 oz. of it, by my master, who weighed it. I was about melting it down when I was detected.
Q. Do you know where the prisoners lodged?
Jones. Yes, at Mr. West's; one is his son, the other his apprentice, he is a fan-stick maker; the master's name is West. The silver was all but 44 oz. when it came to me, melted down, they melted it down at a jeweller's, an acquaintance of their's; they wanted me to melt this 44 oz. along with 120 oz. to pour it into an ingot for them, to have it all in one lump. I went with Mr. Heley and Mr. Clarke to shew them where the prisoners lived.
West's Defence.
The things that I had were brought to me by Jones, to keep for him.
Lucas's Defence.
It was at the same time Jones brought what I had to keep for him.
Q. to the Prosecutor. I think you was not up the first in the morning.
Prosecutor. The maid was up first, but she could not get into the part of the house that was broke open, because I had a key of a door between, which was locked. I forgot to mention, that I found a candle put out, that stood in one of my candlesticks near the door, that was taken off the hinges; the candle was not mine, I had no such in the house.
Q. Can you tell where the candlestick was over night?
Prosecutor. I cannot positively say; I am sure it was my candlestick.
For West.

1376. 




WILLIAM BUSTIN
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 pair of half-boots, value 5s., the goods of 



David Bristow; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






DAVID BRISTOW
. I am a sawyer. On Saturday night, the 12th of June, I had permission to lie down in a barn in Mr. Abbot's yard at Hanwell—when I went to sleep I took my half-boots off, and when I awoke in the morning they were gone—these are them—the prisoner was not there that I know of.





GEORGE BATE
 (police-constable S 76.) On the 13th of June, at about two o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner—he had these boots with him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in Brentford on the Saturday night; I gave a man half-a-crown for these boots; he said they were his own; I was going across the field, and met the policeman, who charged me with stealing them.





JOHN DENTON
 (police-constable T 203.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 6th Jan., 1840, having been before convicted, transported for seven years)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 31.—


Transported for Seven Years.

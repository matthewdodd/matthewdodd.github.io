            . I keep the Southampton waggon-office. On the 28th of August, about five o'clock in the afternoon, a truss, weighing above 4 cwt. was brought by Messrs. Thorp's porter, and saw it loaded in the waggon - it started that afternoon about six o'clock.

            . I live in Merlin's-rents, Shoe-lane. On the 29th of August, between five and six o'clock, I was sitting in the court nursing my child; Watson, who lodged in the court, was up in her room. A coach stopped at the end of the court. Smith ran up the court from the coach. Watson came down to him, and they both went together to the coach. I saw him take a bed out of the coach, and give it to her. She took it up stairs; then he took out a large parcel in a sack or sheet, and followed her up stairs. She lodged at No. 6. I saw Barber looking out of her window.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was in the sack you do not know - A. No. I had seen Smith several times before, but never spoke to him. I understood that he lived with Watson. They were large bundles. He had top-boots on, which appeared soiled.


                  SUSANNAH 
                  BARBER
               



            . I live at No. 6, Merlin's-rents, on the second floor. On Friday evening, the 29th of August, I was at tea, and saw Smith come up the court. He appeared in a great hurry, and went up to Watson, who lived above me, and called her; she followed him down the court. and presently she came up with a bed, tied in a blanket, and he brought a large white parcel; he returned and fetched a sack, which had red letters on it. Watson's is the back room on the third floor. Smith frequently came to see her. I have seen him go out early and late of a morning, but did not see him come home at night. I saw him on the stairs-one evening, and saw him go out next morning.

Cross-examined. Q. When was that - A. I cannot say I do not know that he lived there. The white parcel appeared as much as he could stand under.
THOMAS WILDEN. I am a constable. On Friday, the 29th, in consequence of information I went to Merlin's-rents, and was on the watch from five o'clock till nine. I was on the other side of Shoe-lane, and saw Watson pass me with something in her apron. I asked what she had there; she said a gown of her's and her sister's, which she had had some time. I asked where she lived. She said in Shoe-lane. I took her into Merlin's-rents, and found a piece of gingham on her. The officers brought Smith down stairs. I sent him to the watch-house. We went into the room with Watson, and asked which room she lived in. She said she sometimes slept in that room, pointing to the back room, third floor; and there we found the bed, a bag with red letters on it, full of calico, and a piece of sheeting. She said the bed was hers. Smith said he knew nothing about them.

            . I am an officer. I and Jones went to this house on Friday. We found Smith coming out of the back bed-room door, on the third floor. I seized him, and said, you are the man I want; he said nothing, but wanted to go into another room. We took him down. His boots were unlaced, and his breeches strings undone, as if he was going to bed. He said he knew nothing about the things.

1762. 




ROSETTA FARRELL
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of April, 1 pair of trowsers, value 12s.; and 1 shirt, value 8s.; the goods of 



William Yells.






WILLIAM YELLS
. On the Saturday week after the 2nd of May, when the prisoner left, I went to look for my trowsers, as I was going out to spend the evening, and they were gone, and also a shirt—I had no occasion to want them before—these now produced are them.





JANE HOOPER
. The prisoner left me this duplicate for the trowsers and shirt on the 10th of May—she had lodged with me three days and three nights—she had taken two table-cloths, and a pair of stockings out of my drawers—she told me she would bring the property back, and pay me next day what she owed me—she left these tickets as a security till she paid me.





JOHN GEORGE TULK
. I am a pawnbroker. This ticket for the shirt and trowsers I gave to the prisoner, I believe—the things were pawned on the 19th of April.





MARY REYNOLDS
. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 9th of April—I cannot say whether I took the trowsers into the kitchen to brush, or whether they were in Mr. Yell's room—he was in mourning, and did not wear them—I forget where I put them.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the watch; it was given to me by the prosecutor; it is my first offence.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—



Transported for Seven Years.

                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Taylor 
               



            .) Did you lose any Thing on the 31st of March?
Taylor. Please you, my Lord, I went to Bed, and this young Woman I thought was going to Bed, too. She was with me four Days and no more.
Q. After that, what happen'd?
Taylor. At Night I went to Bed, and thought that she was going to bed. In the Morning, when I got up, the Door was open, and she had not been in Bed: I had great Reason to suspect that she was the Person that got the Things; and she never came any more.
Q. What did you miss?
Taylor. I miss'd four Napkins, Shift-Sleeves, a Gold Ring, one Silver Salt, taken out of the Children's Pocket.
Q. How came you to find her out?
Taylor. Please you, my Lord, she was taken in Whitechapel.
Q. Why did you charge her?
Taylor. Please you, my Lord, there was one Mrs. Ashly who came to see me on Easter-Monday; she took her with a Hat upon her Head, which she own'd was mine; with that she sent for me; and when I came, the Prisoner confess'd that she was in Liquor when she did it, or she should not have done it; which I believe. She said, she sat down at the End of Field-Alley to sleep, and the Ring was taken out of her Pocket.
Q. Have you any of the Things that you are sure are your's ?
Taylor. Yes, here's the Hat; as for the Gold Ring, she says that she has lost it.
Q. Did you find any Thing of the Napkins again?
Taylor. Only one old one that the Gown was wrapt up in.

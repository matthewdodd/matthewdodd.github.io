GEORGE JOHN SCOTT.
 I live in Hanover-street, Walworth. This is my handkerchief (produced)—I missed it in Fleet-street—I do not know how it was taken.





MICHAEL HAYDON
 (City policeman, 21.) On 8th March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty at Holborn-bridge, and saw the prisoners with a number of thieves—I watched them—Smith went up to a gentleman at a picture shop, in Farringdon-street, and felt his pocket—Whitaker stood behind him, partly screening him—I followed them into Fleet-street—Smith went up to Mr. Scott, and felt his pocket—Whitaker screened him—they moved away in a hurry—I spoke to Scott—he went with

me to Shoe-lane after the prisoners—I pushed them into a doorway, and said to Smith, "I went that handkerchief?"—he said, I have got no handkerchief"—I saw something bulky in the waistband of his trowsers, put my hand in, and took this handkerchief out.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY.
Q. Was there a crowd in Farringdon-street? A. About a dozen persons were at the window—the prisoners were outside—I passed them twice—Smith felt the pockets at both pieces—I was in private clothes—Whitaker appeared to have been at work that day, by his hands and face—I did not know him before.
(Whitaker received a good character.)




NOT GUILTY.

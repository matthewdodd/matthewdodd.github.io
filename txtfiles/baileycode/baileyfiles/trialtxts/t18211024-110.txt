                  SLARK
               



            . I am in the oil trade
, and have a shop in Cockspur-street



, of which Mr. Edensor has the management; I attend to the business in the City. In consequence of an annonymous letter which I received, I communicated it to him, and applied to two City officers to be on the watch - Coleby was in my employ at the time, and Jones lived with me at the time of the Coronation.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long was Coleby in your service - A. Since May, and about fifteen months in the employ of my father before me.


                  THOMAS 
                  EDENSOR
               



            . I manage Mr. Slark's business, in Cockspur-street. Coleby was our porter
, I particularly observed his conduct in September last; he came to open the shop about a quarter past six o'clock; I am generally about the shop at the time. We keep our oil in a house in Warwick-street, which communicates with the shop - two or three days before he was apprehended, I saw about four gallons of oil in a can, in a recess in the back warehouse, it was not the place for it, I saw it there on Saturday and Monday night; he was taken on Tuesday - I never spoke to him about it. It was Mr. Slark's can, I put a mark on it when I first found it there. About eight o'clock on the Tuesday morning, the officer brought the same can back to the shop - the four gallons of oil are worth 1 l. 2 s., and the can 4 s.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your house has an entrance from Cockspur-street, and another from Warwick-street - A. Yes; the oil is kept in the Warwick-street premises. the can was used to carry out oil in - we sometimes leave cans with customers, and have them back when empty - we have a porter and a shopman, besides Coleby - only the shopman was in town at the time; his name is Baker, he absconded on the Tuesday following Coleby's apprehension - I owed him no wages. Neither of them slept on the premises.
Q. On the morning Coleby was taken, did you let him in - A. No; the female servant did, he usually came about six o'clock; I came into the shop at a quarter past seven o'clock - I knew the officers were to be on the watch at six. I found Coleby at his business, when I came down, he was dressed in a light-coloured jacket, which he usually wore; he generally wore a white apron, I cannot say whether he had it on - I looked for the can, it was then gone, I saw it there the night before; Baker generally came after breakfast; I saw him there at eighto'clock that morning, he sometimes came before breakfast, he was not there when I came down stairs - the officers brought the can about half-past eight o'clock; I had marked my initials on it with a fork - Coleby asked leave to go to breakfast as the clock struck eight, the officer came in at that moment and stopped him - I said nothing to him about the can.
Cross-examined by MR. PRINSEP. Q. Was it Coleby's business to serve out oil to the lamplighters - A. Yes; at times. Jones was an extra man.
MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you see Baker at the shop on the morning Coleby was apprehended - A. Yes; about five or ten minutes; there are houses opposite the back premises, but none in front, the window of my room commands a view of Warwick-street; nobody could pass that way without my seeing them, if I was out of bed.

                  SHEPPARD
               



            . I am a City officer. On the 18th of September, I and Clinton were in attendance in Cockspur-street, at a quarter before six o'clock; I stationed myself behind a hoard where I had a full view of the shop, and at a quarter past six, I saw Coleby unscrewing his master's shutters, and observed him looking towards the piazza of the Opera-house - he nodded his head, as if to call a person, and then beckoned with his fingers; immediately after, the prisoner Jones came up from that direction - I saw Coleby run into the shop and go backwards; Jones was then just within the door, Coleby brought out a can from the back part of the shop, and gave it to Jones, who put it on his left shoulder and went to the Opera-house, under the Piazza, to the corner of Charles-street, turned round, looked about him, and then went up the Haymarket, up Coventry-street, to the door of No. 35, Greek-street, Soho - he put the can off his shoulder and rang the bell, it appeared a private house; I went by before the door was opened, and saw the can standing at the door and another alongside it; I do not know how that came there (Clinton was rather before me), I passed by, took no notice, and in a moment the door was opened (I could not see who by) and shut uncommonly quick - Jones was shut in and took the two cans in; Clinton and I immediately got to the door, he forced it open with his hands, as the bolt had not quite shot, and another door inside the passage was nearly shut before we got to it, they shut it inside, it was only single latched - we opened it, and immediately laid hold of Jones and asked where he brought that can from (the two were in sight) he said he found it under the Piazza; we asked young Warner, who stood by (dressed in his night-gown, without shoes, stockings, or breeches) if he knew him, he said it was "Old Jones." His father hearing the noise, came down, and asked what was the matter - the son said "It was only Old Jones;" and either said That he had got something, or he had got oil, I do not know which - we asked if Jones lodged in the house, the son, in the hearing of the father, said No; and denied knowing him, I believe both denied knowing him, but it was in the father's hearing - he stood naked on the stairs, I had Jones then in custody.
Q. When Warner said he did not know Jones, did you hear the father say any thing - A. I did not hear, I was then taking care of Jones. We took both father and son into custody, and when they had dressed themselves, we took them to Bow-street, and then to St. Martin's watch-house. The cans of oil were put in a house next door to Warner's; we fetched them and took them to Bow-street, both were full of oil; Mr. Edensor saw them at Bow-street. After apprehending them, we went to Slark's and took Coleby.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are a City officer - A. I am constable of St. Vedas, Foster-lane. I was first applied to on Friday, and saw Coleby that day, I knew then that he was suspected; I went there with the impression that he was suspected - Mr. Slark's shop is near the end of Sussex-street, I was the width of the street from them.
Q. Had you and Clinton talked about Coleby's dress - A. We talked about his dress as we went along together to wait for them - he had a fustian jacket on, and opened the shop in that dress; I cannot say whether he had an apron on, I think he was described to me as having a white jacket on; I might describe it as white, it was between white and brown - he was in sight four or five minutes, I knew him before - Jones had a blue jacket on.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time in the morning did you see the cans left at the door in Greek-street - A. I suppose better than half-past six o'clock, we entered the house instantly, only young Warner was present when I first went in. There is a fan-light over the street door, it was very light in the passage; and after passing the inside door, there is a light from the staircase; Warner was not a yard from Jones, and the oil stood at Jones's feet, as if he had just set it down. There is but one door to the house, Jones said he found it under the Piazza; it was after that I asked Warner if he knew him, and he said it was "Old Jones" - the father came down after that, and the son said "Here is old Jones, and he has got some oil, or has got something - Clinton asked what room the man lodged in, they said he did not lodge there; Clinton then asked old Warner what room he lodged in, he said, up stairs, and Clinton went up - they denied knowing where Jones lodged; then Warner wanted to go up stairs to dress - they did not at first deny knowing Jones, but denied knowing where he lodged; they afterwards said they did not know him - a man came out of a room on the ground floor, just shewed himself, and asked what noise that was, I do not know what answer was made, he shut the door and went in directly. I believe he was in his shirt - a man, who appeared to be a coachman, came down, and Warner's wife came down, I do not know whether she or her husband came down first, I believe both came down nearly together - I was engaged with Jones and young Warner, and cannot say what passed on the stairs.
MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you sure Coleby is the man - A. Yes; I had seen him three times before, and had been watching him there twice before - I believe the father was on the stairs when the man put his head out to ask about the noise - I had not seen Jones before that morning.

            . I am a City officer. On the 18th of September, I accompanied Sheppard to watch this house. We sat down at the corner of Cockspur-street about half-past five o'clock, and about a quarter past six, saw Coleby come from Spring-garden gates, and go to his master's -he entered the back door in Warwick-street, came out in front in Cockspur-street, took down the bar of the left hand shutter, stood with it on his hand, and nodded his head to beckon to some one, and then beckoned with his hand - I was exactly opposite, not concealed, a coach or cart passed, so that I could not see him for a moment, but when that moved, I saw Jones two or three yards inside the door - I saw him with his right hand receive a can from Coleby and put it on his left shoulder, then walk out of the shop to the Opera Piazza. and at the end of the Piazza, he turned round to look about him - I was then very near him, and took out my watch to avoid suspicion, and set it by St. James's clock, he then went on through different courts and streets, I never lost sight of him till he went to the door of No. 35, Greek-street - he never looked behind, he took the can off his shoulder and put it on the step of the door on the left side, and in a second or so, another man came up with another can and placed that by it, said something to Jones and went off immediately, Sheppard was turning the corner at the time; the house is about three doors from a street, he was behind me - I then spoke to a butcher's boy next door, to avoid suspicion, and in the mean time the door was opened and Jones went in with both cans, and the door was closed immediately; I rushed against it twice, and the second time burst it open and entered a passage with a door to it, which I pushed open, and saw Jones with the cans of oil, one on each side of him, and young Warner naked, all but his bed gown, he attempted to go up stairs, I stopped him, asked Sheppard for a pair of handcuffs which I put on Jones, and asked young Warner if Jones lodged there, and in what room, he said he did not know, he knew nothing of the man - his mother came down undressed, and said "Good God! what is the matter;" he said "I do not know, here is Old Jones" - I asked Jones how he came by the oil, he said he found it in the Haymarket; young Warner wanted his clothes, I said I would go up and fetch them - I followed his mother up into the one pair of stairs front room, and found the bed-clothes down, as if he had just got out; his shoes were by the bed side - the father was in the back room, dressing himself, and rubbing his eyes, which were wet.
Q. Was that the first time you saw him - A. It was, I asked him if he had any oil about the place, he said No; he was very willing that I should search, and his wife opened a box of linen, there was none there - I found none in those two bed-rooms - I came down and asked young Warner to shew me the cellar where he kept his oil, he said "Let me go up stairs and fetch my boots and handkerchief" - I went and got them from the room, he put them on, and then took me to a yard at the back of the house; I said "This is not the place "- I went to the cellar where the oil is kept, he said he had none; I said I would not be trifled with, and down stairs he should go - when I got to the bottom of the kitchen stairs, I spied a door open on the left hand, where there were three very large oil cans, all empty - I said I should look to see if they had any mark to lead to any thing, he said nothing - I then went along a passage under ground, and found a door rather open, and thought I heard a latch go; young Warner was rather before me; I told him to stop, and said"Is there not somebody in that room?" he said "No, nobody at all;" I knocked at the door, and a female answered from within "We are two lone women, and are naked" - I said I only wanted to ask a question, as Warner had deceived me - I could not believe him; she opened the door, pointed to a cellar, and said "That is Mr. Warner's cellar" - Warner said it was locked, but I might break it open; Mrs. Warner brought the key down, and there I found two cans of oil, a funnel, and a quart measure; I came up with Warner, the father was coming down stairs, and I believe he said "For God's sake, what is the matter now;" the son said "Why here is Old Jones got some oil" - he spoke loud, the father told him not to make such a noise; I said we must take them all three to a place of confinement, and asked old Warner which was the best place - he said we had better go to Bow-street at once.
Q. Before you found the oil in the cellar, had the father said there was no oil - A. Yes; while he was rubbing his eyes on the bed, he said he had no oil, and the son denied there being any in the place. We took them to Bow-street, and left the cans of oil next door at the butcher's; they both said they knew nothing of Jones. We fetched the oil and went to Cockspur-street, saw Mr. Edensor, told him I must take his man Coleby, which I did; I did not tell him what I took him for, he never asked what charge I had against him, or what I was going to do with him.
Q. Did you learn where the Warners carried on business - A. Yes, under the Adelphi. I went there the same morning between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found between 400 and 500 gallons of oil, and four immensely large empty cans - three of them had the name of Dare on them at full length. The prosecutor claimed them.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you a parish officer - A. I am an extra City officer. Sheppard employed me to assist him - I have been an officer sixteen years. I saw Mr. Slark on Monday, and Coleby also, he was pointed out to me as Mr. Slark's servant, that I should know him again; Sheppard said that was Mr. Slark's servant, and we must watch him - I know nothing about Baker. I cannot say whether Coleby saw me; it was a light morning; Sheppard was with me - he might have seen us both. I do not know whether Sheppard hid himself, I saw him come from near the hoard - I saw Coleby let in at the back door, and come out in front, he had an oil can in his hand when he entered the house - I did not notice his dress. I never said any thing about his jacket, I knew by his dress on Friday, that the same man had come on Monday, that is the only way I have mentioned his dress - I swear to him by his face. When we returned from Greek-street, I went into the shop and took him; I believe he then had something of a smock frock on - there was another young man behind the counter; I did not particularly notice him. I searched Coleby's lodging, and found a quart oil can, marked Dare.
Q. Were you the officer that wanted his wife to give you drink - A. No, she offered to send for some; I did not want to alarm her - I said I only wanted to see if there was any cans, as some were lost - I wanted to look in a cupboard, she asked what I wanted; I said I was looking for the gin bottle. On my oath I did not ask her to send for liquor.
Cross-examined by MR. PRINSEP. Q. When Coleby turned the corner by Spring-gardens, was he alone - A.Yes. Jones had a blue jacket and apron on, like a lamplighter.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you say you spied a door open, you mean you saw it open - A. Yes. I went into the house in less than two minutes - Warner stood a yard or a yard and a half from Jones, they were abreast, I looked through a key hole, and saw there was a stay shop there. The moment I entered the passage I seized and handcuffed Jones - Warner said he did not know whether Jones lodged there or not.
Q. For what you know old Warner was in bed and asleep then - A. I followed the mother up, and found him up and dressing, he had his breeches on, I was not in the house two minutes before I went up - nobody claimed the oil found in the house. I have not paid any money towards this prosecution.
Q. Have you given any money towards it - A. The boy Buchanan said just now, that he was hungry - I gave him sixpence to buy some pudding, he returned me four pence.

                  BUCHANAN
               



            . I am errand boy to a butcher, next door to Warner's. On the 18th of September, I saw Jones at Warner's, when the officers came - I had seen him go there two or three times a week, for ten weeks before; it was always from twenty minutes to half-past six o'clock in the morning, two men used to come, and bring cans with them - I have seen him come on Saturday afternoon, and receive money. I have seen Warner, sen., and the servant girl, pay it into his hands. On the 18th, I saw the officers go into the house - I stood at the door. Jones brought one can, and another man brought another, which he gave him, and run away.
Cross-examined by MR. PRINSEP. Q. What is Jones - A. I do not know, I only know him by bringing oil; from his dress I suppose him to be a lamplighter - he came on Saturday for money, and sometimes the other man came; Warner did not appear to have any business.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you say he brought oil, you mean cans - A. I have seen the girl empty the cans, in the middle of the day; I could not see what was in them when they were brought. I have seen her pay him money, and have seen her master pay him money in her presence.
Q. When you were going to Bow-street did you say to her
"I shall make haste and get my work done. I shall be there at one o'clock, and speak a d - d good word for your master, and will do for him" - A. I never said any thing of the sort.
Q. When you came back did you say, "Well I am come home, he is found guilty, I have done for him" - A. No; I said no such words; nor did I ever say to any body "I'll be d - d if I don't go and give evidence, as it will prove a prime thing for me."
MR. EDENSOR. The cans are our's, and one is that I marked T. E.; the other has "Dare," on it; the prosecutor succeeded him in the business. The oil in the can which I marked, is spermaceti, which is 5 s. 6 d. a gallon; lamplighters do not use sperm, but common oil, at 3 s. a gallon. The cans found at the Adelphi are also marked Dare - we bought all his stock. I know no other oil dealer of his name.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you say the three cans found at the Adelphi were ever in Mr. Slark's possession - A. No; I have lived eight years with him; he never lit the Opera House. I do not know whether Dare ever did.
MR. SLARK. I succeeded my father in the business - he bought it of Mr. Dare. I tasted both the oils, it is sperm, and the same sort as that in my house.
Cross-examined. Q. How long ago did your father buy the business - A. Above thirty years. I do not know that Mr. Taylor of the Opera House, bought oil at the house. We occasionally send it out by the porters, who take a full can and bring back an empty one. They are generally bought when they first go out, and changed from time to time.
COLEBY'S Defence. I know nothing of it.
JONES'S Defence. I found it under the Piazza. I frequently worked for Warner, and left it there to find an owner for it.
WARNER, JUN. put in a written defence, which had been intended as a joint defence for himself and father, but the Court thought the evidence not strong enough to call on the father for a defence. It stated, that the three cans found at the Adelphi were not the prosecutor's, Warner, sen. having had them in constant use in his business as a lamplighter for ten years. That he lit the Opera House, and several Theatres in the metropolis; that Warner's, sen. brother occasionally called before any of the family were up, and on this morning the bell rang, and the mother called her son to let his uncle in, he immediately went and opened the door, and Jones, whom they then employed as a lamplighter, came in, followed by the officers, they could not tell what induced him to bring the oil, as it was entirely without their knowledge; that many years ago Mr. Glossop provided oil for the Opera House, and Dare carried on business in Cockspur-street, and he had the oil from Dare for the Opera House; that Warner succeeded Glossop, and as to their denying all knowledge of Jones, he understood the officer to ask, What do you know of this business? and his answer was, "I know nothing of it." The defence then went on to state, that Warner, sen. had lived in repute for twenty-five years, and would not forfeit a good character for such a trifle.

            . I live at No. 1, Delap-court, near Queen-square, Westminster, and have kept the house twenty-four years. Coleby married my daughter seven years ago; they have lived with me ever since. After he was taken the officers came to search the house. Clinton said "What have you in the cupboard, you have some bottles." I said there was nothing in them, he was welcome to look. He said "What is there nothing you can give us to drink."


                  THOMAS 
                  WARNER
               



            . I am brother to Warner, sen., he lived in Greek-street. I am a lamplighter, and live at No. 7, Vere-street. I was in the habit of going to his house from half-past six to seven o'clock in the morning. I have worked for him these two years; I used to ring at the bell, the lad sometimes let me in. At times I used to take a can of oil with me from the Adelphi to go to work with at Sadler's Wells, and to call him up. I used to light the Sans Pareil and Sadler's Wells Theatres. I used to put the oil down at the door till they took it in.
Q. You used to leave the can at the door - A. Yes. I was afterwards to take it Sadler's Wells Theatre.
MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you carry sperm or common oil - A. Both. We use sperm oil to the patent lampsat Sadler's Wells Theatre. We buy it at Mr. Enderby's and Mr. Johnson's.
Q. You did not get it from the Adelphi - A. Yes; it is kept there. I left some at Greek-street, because I could not carry it all.
- SARSOM. I am a stay-maker, and keep the house in Greek-street, Warner lodged on the first floor. I have seen his brother bring cans of oil there, or something. On the morning he was taken I heard a noise in the passage, they knocked at my door and asked if I knew Jones. I let all the house out, I had not noticed a ring at the bell.

                  HIGGS
               



            . I am servant to Warner, and have lived four years with him. I never saw Jones at the house, nor ever saw my master pay him any money, nor did I ever pay him any. I know Buchanan - On the day he went to Bow-street, before he went, he said to me "I shall make haste and get my work done, I shall be there at one o'clock, and shall speak a d - d good word for your master, and will do for him;" and when he returned, he said, "Well, I am come home, he is found guilty, I have done for him."
MR. ALLEY. Q. Has he a wife - A. Yes. I never slept in the house. I used to go there between seven and eight o'clock in the morning. They kept no other servant.
Q. How long have you known young Warner - A. As long as I can remember, I went to school with him. I was going out for some porter, when the boy said this, it was about ten o'clock on Saturday morning. I had never spoken to him before. I saw him again about twelve o'clock when I was cleaning the steps, he tapped me on the shoulder, and said "I am almost done work, I shall be there at one, and will do for him;" and about four o'clock, he saw me at the street door, and said he was come home, and he was found guilty, &c.
Q. These were the only times you ever spoke to him - A. Yes. I did not tell his master nor did I go to Bow-street to tell the Magistrate. I told Mr. Sarsom of it the same day, directly, and told my mistress.
COURT. Q. Did you say any thing in answer to him - A. No. When he spoke to me at twelve o'clock, I said I would tell his master.
- SARSOM. I have heard the girl mention what the butcher's boy had said to her, but I cannot speak to the time.

            . I am a lamplighter, and knew Buchanan by sight. He met me one morning in Church-street, and said he should be a d - d fool if he did not go and give evidence, as it would be a prime thing for him, he said so on the Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock, as he was out going with meat on his shoulder. I had not spoken to him - he forced his conversation on me - he said he should have a crown a day for it.

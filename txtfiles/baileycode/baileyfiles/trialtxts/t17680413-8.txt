            . I am a hatter and hosier
, and live at the corner of Duke-street, Piccadilly


. On the first of April I lost about 27 pair of stockings; there were two dozen of thread, two pair of cotton, and two of silk, some leather gloves, and a remnant of silver lace.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
Le Quenter. He was apprentice
 to me almost three years; I did not know I had been robbed, till a silversmith's servant told me the prisoner had carried some silver lace there; then I searched his box, and found the things mentioned in the indictment in his box, and I found the bit of silver lace in the bottom of the lining of his coat; he himself opened his box, and owned they were my property.
Q. How old is the prisoner?
Le Quenter. He is about nineteen years of age, he has behaved honestly and well; I was greatly surprized when I found this out.
- Newman. I am an apprentice to the prosecutor; when the silversmith's man came to acquaint my master of the prisoner's carrying some silver lace there, we thought proper to search his box; there we found the things mentioned, (produced in court.)
Prosecutor. I know these to be my property.
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the court.

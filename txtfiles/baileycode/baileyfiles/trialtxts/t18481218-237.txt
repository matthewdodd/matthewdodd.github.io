WILLIAM FINN
 (City-policeman, 276). I saw the prisoner and two others with a basket of linen, in Long-lane—I stopped the prisoner, the others got away—I asked what he had got—he said washing, and he was going to take it home—he immediately pushed the basket into my face, gave me a severe kick in the ankle, and escaped—a gentleman stopped him—Mrs. King's carman came up and identified the things.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Where were the other two? A. Behind him—they whistled and ran away as I stopped him—I saw him stopped in Barbican, about forty yards from where I first stopped him—I was not two yards behind him, and never lost sight of him—I am sure he is the man.





CHARLES COLLINS

I had this basket of linen safe in my cart when I paid the toll at Smithfield—Mrs. King called my attention to the loss of it—I went down Long-lane, and saw the prisoner with it on his head—the policeman stopped him, he threw it down, and ran away—I picked it up.

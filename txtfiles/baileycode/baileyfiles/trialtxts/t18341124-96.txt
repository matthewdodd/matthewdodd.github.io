WILLIAM WRIGHT
 and 




JAMES YOUNG
 were indicted for

 feloniously stealing, on the 
7th of November, 1 chaise-cover, value 6s., and 1 padlock and key, value 1s., the property of 



Richard Percival.






WILLIAM COLLINS
. I am groom to Mr. Richard Percival—he lives at No. 2, Highbury-park, Islington. I lost this chaise-cover from the coach-house, on the 11th of October—the coach-house is at the back of our house—the padlock and key were in the door.





ALFRED HARRIS
 (police-constable N 100.) At half-past one o'clock on Friday morning, the 7th of November, I saw the two prisoners coming out of Canonbury-field, about half a mile from the prosecutor's premises—I followed them two or three hundred yards—I then stopped them, and questioned them—Young had a piece of green baize on his shoulder, it was raining—I raised the green baize up, and I saw a chisel in his right hand jacket pocket, and he had a padlock and key in his lefthand pocket—he said it was his own—I walked some distance further by the side of the New River, and I saw Wright, who was some distance in front, doing something to the front of his person—I went up to him, and saw something in his hand, by his side—I said "What is that?"—and he directly threw it into the river—I suppose it was a crow-bar—I then found a skeleton key in his pocket—I seized the two prisoners—Wright broke from me, and ran off—I sprung my rattle, and he was stopped near the Thatched House, by my brother officer, who found the chaise-cover in his hat.





GEORGE BRITTAIN
. (police-constable N 46.) I heard the rattle spring that morning—I saw Wright running, and took him—I found this cover.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Young's Defence. We found these things wrapped in the green baize, at the back of Canonbury-house.

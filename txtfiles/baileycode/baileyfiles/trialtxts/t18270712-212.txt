            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was at the corner of Charles-street City-road


, at half-past nine o'clock, on the 12th of July, and saw the two prisonersand two other boys, near Mr. Reece's shop; the other two went to the shop two or three times, and came back; I saw the prisoners immediately run away - I and Levisen secured the prisoners; Thomas had a cake of soap under his jacket; I am sure they were all in company, and could see what the others did.
JOSEPH REECE. I am a tallow-chandler
, and believe this soap to be mine; I did not see the robbery committed.

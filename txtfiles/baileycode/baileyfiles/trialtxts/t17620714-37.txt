            . I keep an eating house at the Hermitage


; the prisoner has dined at my house five or six times; I missed these things on the 14th of June; he had been at my house that day. Last Friday  he came to the Ship tavern near me; I went and charged him with taking the things; I took him before Justice Berry; he at first denied knowing any thing of them, but at last owned he had taken and pawned them, and shewed us the house where they were found
The prisoner in his defence said he could not show in the least how he came by them.

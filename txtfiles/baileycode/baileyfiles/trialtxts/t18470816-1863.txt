1863. 




ABRAHAM WISE
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 bridle, value 2s.;


and 1 mare, price 6l.; property of 



Robert Simmonds; having been before convicted of felony.


MR. BALDWIN
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN NEWMAN.
 I am a cow-keeper, at Kensington Gravel-pits. On Sunday morning, the 1st of Aug., about seven o'clock, the prisoner brought a mere to me, and asked me to buy it—he asked 5l. for it—I asked whose it was—he said it was his father's—I suspected something, communicated with Mr. Simmonds, sent for a constable, and gave him in charge—I had never seen him before.





JAMES PRIOR.
 I am servant to Mr. Simmonds, of Northold, near Ealing. On Saturday, the 31st of July, at five o'clock in the evening, I turned a mare out into the field—I did not see her again till the following Tuesday—I missed the bridge out of the stable on the Monday morning; I had seen it safe on Saturday.





ROBERT SIMMONDS.
 I am a farmer, at Northold—I had a bay mare, and missed her on Sunday morning—I found her at Kensington, in Mr. New-man's possession—the prisoner was at my house at half-past nine o'clock on Saturday night—the field is about forty poles from where I live.

JURY.
Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Yes, I had seen him many times—I never authorised him to take or to ride the mare.





STEPHEN AYRES
 (policeman.) I took the prisoner into custody, at Mr. Newman's—on the way to the station, he said the mare belonged to his father, who was very ill, and had authorised him to sell.

Prisoner's Defence. I never stole it; a man gave it me, told me to sell it for 5l., and meet him in Smithfield; he gave me a shilling, and told me to say it was my father's, who lived in Hertfordshire.





JOHN PHILLIPS
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted April, 1846, and confined one month)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

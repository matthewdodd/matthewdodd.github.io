             sworn.
I only prove the property; the things were lost on the 2d of May, between three and four in the afternoon, it was a line with some clothes upon it in the garden; I had been there five minutes before, and saw the things; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; they took part of the line away.
- MUMFORD sworn.
The prisoner cut the line down at each end, and brought the line and clothes away together, they were wrapped round the body of Sparkes; only one got over; I jumped over the rail, and when I got up to him he dropped the clothes from round his body; he ran away, I ran after him, he turned upon me when he found he could get no farther, Mr. Morgan came up to his assistance, he said, what have you got to do with me, Sir, says I, you have no right to them clothes; I collared him, he abused me very much, and I collared Morgan, a coal heaver came to my assistance; Morgan was in sight when he took the clothes, they were taken from him and given to the watchman; they are the same.

On the 2d of May I was sent for to take them into custody; I took possession of the things.

PRISONER SPARKES'S DEFENCE.

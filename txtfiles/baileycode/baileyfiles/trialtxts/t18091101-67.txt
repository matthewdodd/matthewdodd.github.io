                  STEVENS
               



            . I am a ticket-porter. On Friday, the 6th of October, I was crossing Bishopsgate-street


, in the parish of St. Helens, I saw 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Taylor
               



             or take from the pocket of 
               
                  Evan 
                  Christian
               



             a pocket book; I immediately stepped up to 
               
                  Evan 
                  Christian
               



             and told him that he had been robbed. He said he did not know that he had, he put his hand to his pocket, said yes, I have lost my book. I said if you follow me we will endeavour to catch them. I went into St. Helen's, there we saw the two prisoners, 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Taylor
               



             and 
               
                  William 
                  Brown
               



             standing looking at the book. I said here they are, before I got to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Taylor
               



             he dropped the book on the ground. I then asked 
               
                  Evan 
                  Christian
               



             if that was his property, he said it was: we then secured them both, brought them a cross the way, gave them in charge of Shephard the officer.
Q. You are sure you saw Taylor put his hand into his pocket. - A. I did: he took it from the left side of Mr. Christian.


                  SAMUEL 
                  SHEPHARD
               



            . I am an officer. The prisoners were given into my custody. The book was given me by Christian in the presence of Stevens.
Q. To STEVENS. Is that the same book that you saw him take out of Christian's pocket. - A. Yes, and this is the same book that was given to Shephard.
Taylor's Defence. As I was coming along Bishopsgate-street, there was a crowd on the pavement by St. Helen's. I saw the book on the pavement I took it up; this gentleman and two more followed me, and accused me of taking the pocket book, in the flurry I dropped it.
Brown's Defence. I was going to the West India Dock, I had a newspaper in my hand reading of it, and when I got into the court I was reading of it. I immediately turned round my head, I saw three men lay hold of this young man; I was fifty yards a head, I turned back with the newspaper in my hand, and when I came to the people that had hold of this man, Steven's laid hold of me, and said I was one of them. He snatched the newspaper out of my hand; he asked the gentleman if it was his newspaper, the gentleman said it was not, he gave it me back again.
Stevens. I did not snatch the newspaper out of his hand, I asked Christian if it was his property. There were three of them together going down St. Helen's, one of them got away.

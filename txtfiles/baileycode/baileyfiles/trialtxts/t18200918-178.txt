            . I am a haberdasher
. I live in Rathbone-place, Oxford-street


. On the 7th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning the prisoner came and bought two nails of muslin at 2 s. a yard, and tendered me 1 s. I had not got a 6 d. in the till, and nobody else was in the shop. I turned my back to call the cook to get two sixpences for a shilling, and gave the prisoner 9 d., another woman came into the shop with the prisoner. I had been showing some muslin trimming to a person. When the prisoner was gone I missed the whole bundle of trimming, (the other woman still remained) it consisted of 150 yards. I followed her, secured her, and immediately the whole dropped from her gown.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

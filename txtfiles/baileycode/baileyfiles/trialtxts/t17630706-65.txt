            . I met the prisoner and another near St. Paul's


, they led me to the house where he lodged, I put all my things as mentioned in the indictment into my breeches pocket, and put my breeches under the mattrass, about the middle of my body as I say; the prisoner lay with me in the same bed; there were two or three other people lay in the same room; I never was in the house before, and do not know where it is, I never knew the prisoner before, he went away before I missed the things.

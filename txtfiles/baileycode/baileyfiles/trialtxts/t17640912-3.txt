             (the younger.) I missed a linen handkerchief: I was told the prisoner (who was servant to the barber
 that used to come to shave me) was suspected; I went to his master's shop, on the 3d of August, and found my handkerchief in his pocket. (Produced and deposed to.) I was told by the servants, my father's watch was missing from out of the kitchen: he was taken before Sir John Fielding, and charged with taking that, but he denied it. after that, the watch was brought to me by his master. (Produced and deposed to.)

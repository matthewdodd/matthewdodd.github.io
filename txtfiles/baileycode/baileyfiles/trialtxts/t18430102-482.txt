GEORGE SUTTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of Dec., 2 night-gowns, value 1s. 6d., 1 pair of shoes, 2s.; 1 apron, 6d., 1 comb, 6d., and 1 handkerchief, 6d., the goods of 



Eliza Maria Thorogood, from her person.






ELIZA MARIA THOROGOOD
. About eight o'clock on the night of the 29th of Dec, I was passing the corner of Little Moorfields—I had a brown-paper parcel containing two night-gowns, an apron, a handkerchief, a pair of shoes, and a comb—the prisoner came up, touched the parcel, and then drew it from my arm—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the person—this is the parcel.


Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you see the person plainly who brushed against you, and then took the parcel? A. I did not see him till the parcel was out of my hand—I saw him directly—he was not a yard off me—his back was to me—I can recognise him by his dress and size—I did not see his face at the time.





MART ANN BUTLER
. I am the prosecutrix's sister. I saw the prisoner run away with her parcel.

Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to your sister? A. Close by her—I saw the prisoner's back—I know him by his dress and size.





THOMAS CHEW
. I am a livery stable-keeper, and live in Little Moorfields. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run up my yard—I stopped him.





WILLIAM BENHAM
. I am messenger of the General Post-office. At a quarter past eight o'clock, on the 29th of Dec., I saw a boy, who I believe to be the prisoner, running down Little Moorfields—he threw the parcel at my feet—I took it up—he was running towards New Union-street, in the direction of Mr. Chew's yard.





JAMES COOK
 (City police-constable, No. 157.) I took the prisoner from Mr. Chew.
(Richard Petty, a machine-ruler; and Mary Saunders, of Moor-lane, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. * Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

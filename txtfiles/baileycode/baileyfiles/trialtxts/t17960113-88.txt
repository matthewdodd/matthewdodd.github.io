I am a shoe-maker
: On the 13th of January, about seven o'clock, I was measuring a gentleman for a pair of half-boots; I heard my apprentice call out, stop thief; I immediately ran out, and saw the man before me; a gentleman coming down stopped him immediately.
Q. How far had he got from your shop, when he was stopped? - A. About one hundred yards; he never was out of my sight; when the gentleman stopped him, he said, it was not him, what did he stop him for; they took him immediately to the watch-house, nothing more passed; I staid in the shop, and left them to take him to the watch-house.
Q. Was any thing found upon him? - A. No.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What sort of a night was this? - A. It was not dark.
Q. What time in the evening was it? - A. It was the 13th day of the month, it was not dark.
Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. I did not take thought about it.
Q. Did it rain? - A. No.
Q. When the prisoner was stopped, he asked what he was stopped for; stop-thief had been cried before that; every body understood what you had been robbed of; was it not understood that you had lost some shoes? - A. They did not understandwhat was lost, they knew something was lost; the prisoner said it was not him.

Last Wednesday night, I was coming down Bow-street, I heard the cry of "stop thief;" I met the prisoner, and stopped him, and asked him what was the matter, he was running; there were a great many people, some before, and some behind; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he ran for; he said nothing at all; I took him down Bow-street.
Q. Did you see him throw away any thing? - A. No; I felt him down, and found nothing on him. I carried him to the watch-house; he went very quietly.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, at the time you heard the cry of "stop thief," there were a great many persons running; you searched the prisoner and found nothing upon him; he went very readily with you, and you took him to the watch-house? - A. Yes.

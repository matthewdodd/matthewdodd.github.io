GUILTY
 Aged 35.—



Confined Six Months.
MR. BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






HENRY WOOD
 (police-sergeant, K 23). On 10th Feb., at half-past ten at night, I saw Ashton at the door of a marine-store shop in Robin Hood-lane, Poplar, with a piece of lead in his hand; Collins was with him—he ran away—Ashton tried to run, but I caught him—Collins cried out namnus, which I believe means to run—I took Ashton and this lead—I found lead had been cut from a gutter of the Eastern Counties Railway—I measured the lead that I found with Ashton, and it fitted exactly—Ashton said he knew nothing about it—he would not give any address—I had seen them with the lead near where it was missed from, and followed them.

Collins. I was not there. Witness. I am certain you were; I have known you from a child.





JOHN BULL
 I am in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway. I missed some lead from a gutter on a shed in a field belonging to the railway on 11th Feb.—I saw it safe on 7th—I assisted to measure this lead produced—it corresponded.





JOSEPH PUDDIFORD
 (policeman, K 270). I took Collins on the Tuesday following—I told him what it was for—he said, "I know nothing about any lead; you had better look after the others who stole a copper from Blackwall-yard."





JOSEPH PUDDIFORD

re-examined. I produce a certificate of Collins's conviction

at Clerken well—(read—Convicted Dec., 1846, confined six months, six weeks solitary)—he is the person.

COLLINS—


GUILTY
 Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

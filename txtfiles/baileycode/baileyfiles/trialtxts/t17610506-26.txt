William Downes. I was walking up Holbourn


 on the 28th of April, and I perceived myself jostled by one or two people, I put my hand to my pocket, and found my handkerchief gone. I looked about me, and saw the prisoner at the bar within two or three yards of me, seemingly passing by me; I was the more suspicious of him, as his hand seemed to me to have something in it in his pocket. I went to him, and put my hand down by his right-hand, and drawed out my own handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket.
Q. Are you sure it was your handkerchief?
Downes. I am, it was mine, it was marked D, Num. 6, I have half a dozen of the same kind. I got a constable, and gave him charge of the prisoner, and took him to justice Welch's. His worship was not in the way, but there was another magistrate, who committed him.
Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?
Downes. He begged he might serve his Majesty.
Thomas Freeman. I was along with Mr. Downes, going up Holbourn, near Staple's inn, Mr. Downes had hold on my shoulder, coming through the bar, there was a sort of a jostle, the prisoner went over the way with another man, leaning on his shoulder. Mr. Downes put his hand into his pocket, and said, he had lost his handkerchief; he stepped up to the prisoner, and I stepped close after him, he went to the prisoner's side, and pulled his handkerchief out of the prisoner's pocket.
Q. What did the prisoner say?
Freeman. The prisoner said, he had picked it up.
Q. from Prisoner. Was I before Mr. Downes or behind him, when you first saw me?
Freeman. Before him.
Q. Had the prisoner past by Mr. Downes?
Freeman. He had.
Prisoner's defence.
I am very innocent of it, I never intended to rob the gentleman, no more than the farthest person in the world. I am a plaisterer by trade, and I was going to a gentleman that I worked for to get a job, I saw the handkerchief lie on the ground, there were two or three people just by it. I said, does this belong to you, they said no. I walked along with it in my hand, looking at it, then I put it into my pocket, I have a person here that saw me pick it up.
For the prisoner.

Q. How far did the constable live down the lane?
Prosecutor. It was rather below Gray's-inn-gate.

            . I live at Enfield


. On Monday the 27th of Feb. I mist 40 s. worth of halfpence out of my compting house. I had a suspicion of the prisoner. I followed him and searched him; I found eleven shillings in halfpence upon him. He confessed he had hid the rest in a bag in a dunghill, and went with me to shew me, where I found them.
Q. Was the prisoner your servant?
Brough. He had been my servant
, but was gone away.
Q. How old is he?
Brough. He is about fourteen years old. His father has worked at my house thirty years. I should be glad to recommend him to mercy.

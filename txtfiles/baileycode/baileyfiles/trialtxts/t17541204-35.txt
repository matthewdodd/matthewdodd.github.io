The prisoner was employed by the prosecutor as a paviour
 to repair his stable-yard; this stop-cock was in the yard in Dean-street, Soho


, and served the prosecutor with water which comes from Hampstead, and was his property, which the prisoner was seen to take out of the ground by one 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Griffiths 
               



            ; the prisoner was met with it on Tyburn-road by one 
               
                  George 
                  Dalton 
               



            , who belonged to the New-river water-works, whom he asked if he knew where he could sell it, who directed him where to sell it, not examining him how he came by it, being in a hurry.
The prisoner in his defence said he was digging with his pickax, and happened to see the stop-cock, he took it up and threw it on the stones, but what became of it afterwards he did not know.
The prosecutor said he never has had it again, and was obliged to put down another.

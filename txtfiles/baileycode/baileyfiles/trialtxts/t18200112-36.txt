            . I am a watchman of Bishopsgate-street


. On the 6th of December, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in the middle of the street, looking towards Mr. Carpenter's shop - I walked on the other side. He went over to the shop, and looked in at the window sometime, then stretched his hand out, and took some stockings from inside the door. I crossed, and took him into custody within twenty yards of the house. He pulled a stocking out of his trowsers, and said it was all he had. I took him back to the shop, and they missed a pair and a half; he said he took but one. I took him to the watch-house, and the officer found the pair in his hat.

GEORGE NUTTRESS. I am a stone-mason
. On the 1st of August, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I had been drinking with some friends, but was sober - I met the prisoner in Strutton-ground; she asked me home, but instead of taking me home she took me to another house in the Almonry


; I went into a bed-room up one pair of stairs - I was on the bed, but my clothes were not off; in about five minutes she made an excuse to go down stairs for water, and did not return; I had given her 1s. - I felt and missed my watch, which was safe in my pocket when I went into the room - I gave information at the watch-house; I went with Wilkins to another house, and found her; it was not the house I had been to with her - he found my watch under her in the bed; it has my name on it.

            . I am a constable. I had seen the prosecutor with the prisoner about half-past three o'clock- he afterwards informed me he had been robbed; I went to her lodging, at No. 1. Duck-lane, and asked what she had done with the watch - there were two men in her bed, and I found the watch tucked into the bed; she was hiding herself behind the door.
Prisoner's Defence. I got behind the door to let them in - he came, and asked me for the duplicate; I said he had given it to me, and he fetched a Policeman.

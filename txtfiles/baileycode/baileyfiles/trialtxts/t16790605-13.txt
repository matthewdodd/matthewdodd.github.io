A kind of outlandish 
               Fellow

             being in charity taken in at Linn by a Scotch 
               
Master of a Vessel




            , and his Passage given him to London, was so ill-natur'd as to requite that kindness by 


               stealing out of the Ship, as she lay at the Armitage-stairs


, a considerable parcel of Worsted-stockings
            , which he was seen to carry off; and being thereof 

               convicted
            , prayed heartily for 


               Transportation
            ; which, he being a Forreiner, was granted.

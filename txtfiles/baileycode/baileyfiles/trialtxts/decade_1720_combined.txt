The Lady Cobham confirmed the same, and Deposed that she had not seen them since. Mrs. Halsey also deposed that she did not see them, and that they were not deliver'd to her.

Home to his Lady. But this was contradicted by Mr. Halsey and my Lady in every particular. He also called

                  Emmerson

That the next Day he came home and said he was going for 100 l. that he brought home a great deal of Gold, and said afterwards that he had carried it to his Lady. He also called Eliz. Weston, who deposed, that she saw him have a great deal of Gold, and that he told her he had it of Mr. Halsey, and afterwards said, he had given it to his Lady, who returned him a Shilling for his Boat. He also call'd some Persons to prove that he was in a very poor Condition about that Time, and that his Goods were seized on about a Fortnight after. The Jury considering the whole matter, found him

The Prisoner denied the Fact, and said the Hat was his own, which he brought from Bristol, and that his Name was Writ in a Paper which was the inside the Lining. There was indeed a very small piece of Paper rolled up very close found in the Hat; but it appearing that the Prosecutor refused to deliver the Hat to be kept by the Constable till his Tryal, according to my Lord's order when before him, (saying that he could not tell whether he should prosecute him or no) that Circumstance did not avail him: he also called some to invalidate Jackson's Evidence, urging that she did it for the sake of the 30 l. reward for convicting him: but the Court assur'd him there was no reward at all provided for it. The Evidence being very positive, and he appearing to be an old offender, the Jury found him

That in Bedes History, the Sheet L was wanting. which the prisoner desired him to get as soon as possible, because he was going to traffick beyond Sea; that the prisoner bid him not be discourag'd, for let the Quantity or Quality of the Books be ever to great, though he made but a mean Appearance yet he had great Acquaintance, and knew how to dispose them, naming some Persons who bought Books, that were his very good Customers; this Evidence then told him, that he was loth to bring any more openly, upon which the prisoner gave him a Bag. Afterwards hearing that some of the Books were stopt on suspicion, he told the prisoner, who bid him not be frighted, for if any body enquired from whom he had the Books, he would not discover it; but give a description of a wrong Person, which he did. Several of Bede's History in which the Sheet L was wanting were produced in Court, and Sworn to by this Evidence. Mr. 
               
                  William

                  Bowyer 
               



             the Bookseller, he thereupon making search among his Books, mist several mentioned in the Indictment. Mr. Janoh Bowyer deposed, that Blake came to him with a Letter, intimating that he  was sent by a Gentleman who had been his Customer, and hoped he should again be so, but being at present under Misfortunes, desired him to give what he could afford for Leges Ang. Sax. which his Servant brought. Mr. Bowyer bought the Book, but afterwards being in discourse with Mr. Giles and Mr. Innys they both produced Letters to the same Effect, and the same hand Writing. This giving him some suspicion, when Blake came again with Bedes Ecc. Hist. he Apprehended him. 
               
                  William 
                  Blake

The prisoner in his defence said, that he bought the Books of a Gentlemen, but said, he was not bred up a Bookseller, and he did not know the Worth of them, and that he gave Peacock what he ask'd; adding that Mr. Bowyer promised to make it up with him, if he'd return the Books, which he did, and Mr. Bowyers Son gave him a Receipt to discharge him. A great Number of Creditable Witnesses from Deptford where he formerly liv'd, gave him the general Character of an honest and Industrious Man. The Jury found him 

               Guilty

             (not yet taken) and Mary D'arbieau broke open the House of Mr. Folwell in the Night, and took from thence the Goods mention'd in the indictment; which they sold the Prisoner in Holborn


 (his Son Nathaniel being then present and assisting, of which he was convicted at the Sessions in May last). The Prisoner was at first scrupulous of dealing with this Evidence, because he was a new Face, and (as he told Trantum) did not yet look like a thorow faced Rogue, and therefore would not be concern'd with him till he was satisfied of his being a Villian, fit to be trusted. They then agreed to meet at the Ducking-Pond, by the Spaw at Islington, in order to give the Prisoner a satisfactory Account of the Qualifications of this Evidence: which Trantum did; by telling him that he was lately return'd from Transportation. Nay (says the Prisoner) if that's the Case, I am Safe, and all is well. Then they brought the Goods to the Prisoner's House, and he gave them 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce for the Plate, by his own Weights, which were none of the heaviest, and 12 l. 10 s. for the Silk, which was worth 70 l. and threw them a Guinea over in the whole. The Plate was mark'd, and this Evidence ask'd him if he could dispose of it: O! says he, I could safely dispose of the King's Crown if I had it. The Prisoner in his Defence said, That he never saw Leonard before, and called several of his Neighbours to his Reputation.

, where the Goods before-mentioned, and a Person who personated the Thief were produc'd. Mr. Sunderland depos'd That as near as he can remember, the 30th of June, 
               
                  John 
                  Hornby

             being at the Prosecutor's House, he and Mrs. Hatchet went with them in a Coach to a Tavern in Clare-Market, he thinks the Sun Tavern, upon their Promise for the Reward of 6 Guineas, to produce the Goods mentioned, and the Person who stole them. That when they came to the Tavern, they inquir'd for the Thief, and Hornby and Beal went from the Tavern, while Mrs. Hatchet and he staid there, to fetch him, and that in about an Hour and half they came back, and said, That he was in the House, but they did not bring him up with them into the Room; but when Hornby and Beal came in, 
               
                  Edward

                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



             was brought into the Room, in a large black Coat, big enough to hold 2 or 3 of him, he being but a slender Man, and a very large Hat on his Head. That this Charles, Motherby took upon himself to be the Thief, and produc'd the Bag wherein the Things had been stolen, and 19 Rings, 2 Gold Chains, and a Silver Watch.

                  Roberts 
               



            , and that he was a Sawyer in Westminster, That he suspecting he had not told him true, bid Motherby let him see his Hand; which when he had seen, he told Motherby he was not the Person he pretended to be, for he (Mr. Sunderland) himself being a Sawyer, was well satisfy'd he was not a Person of that Business, but some Taylor, Barber, or Garreteer. That his Suspicion belong confirm'd by Mrs. Hatchet, who had seen the Person who stole the Goods, and knew him to be a Man very different in Person from 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



            , he talk'd sharply to him, threatning him, that if he did not confess the Truth he should be sent to Newgate. That then Mothorby begg'd for Favour, and said he was a Perriwig-maker in Golden Lane, and that the Person who stole the Goods was one

                  Roher 
               



             depos'd, That 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



             came to him the latter End of June, the Day he did not well remember, but thought it might be the 26th, and brought a Gold Watch, 3 Gold Rings, and 2 Diamond Rings, desiring him to tell him the Value of them; that he did value the Gold Rings, and a Friend of his, a Jeweller, coming in, did value the Diamond Rings, at 13 s. the one, and 30 s. the other, as he thinks; that himself not pretending to Skill in Watches, it was left with him to get it valued; that the next Morning an Advertisement publish'd by the Goldsmith's Company was brought to him, wherein be found the Gold Watch described, and that thereupon he carried the Watch to Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Hatchet. Other Evidences depos'd. That

            , the Sawyer, who was the Person said to have stolen the Goods, and that 
               
                  Edward 
                  Wootton 
               



             was Brother to the Wife of the said John Dawes. The Prisoners Defence consisted chiefly in Three Things. First, In supporting their Reputation. Secondly, in charging the Prosecutor with a Design of extorting Money from them. And thirdly, In endeavouring to show that they had conform'd themselves to the Statute in that Case made and provided. Wootton and Beal call'd a great many, who gave them a good Character, both as to their Industry in their Callings, Wootton being a Frame-maker, and Beal a Carver; and Motherby also call'd 3 or 4 who gave him a good Character. And to prove the Prosecutor would have extorted Money from them, they call'd 
               
                  Robert 
                  Ward

                  Ward 
               



            , and a Brother of Wootton's, who depos'd, That Mrs. Hatchet would have compounded the Matter for 15 l. But their Evidence being attended with some seeming Improbabilities, and being deny'd by the Prosecutor, it gain'd but little Credit. The Third Part of their Defence related chiefly to Wootton, Beal, and Hornby, who seem'd to infer, That they had comply'd with the Statute, in that they had apprehended 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



            , whom they said they took to be the Thief, and was all the Thief they knew; urging that they had been at a great Expence in apprehending and fetching him 60 or 70 Miles out of the Country. In answer to this the Statute was ordered to be read to them in Court, for their Satisfaction how well they had conform'd themselves to it, and was read accordingly. Upon a full Hearing of the Matter the Jury found them 

               all Guilty of the Indictment

 last. The Prosecutor depos'd, That having been inform'd by his Servant, that she had seen the Prisoner the Night before this Fact, put his Hand into the Money Box, he having before miss'd Money, was resolved to try an Experiment, therefore he put 40 s. into the Draw in the Shop, having mark'd the Money, and desired a Neighbour, who was a Constable, to watch him that Night, and also another Person. That the next Night, when the Shop was shut, the Prisoner came and ask'd for a Quart of Brandy, which being to be fetch'd out of the Cellar, while the Boy was gone down to draw the Brandy, he took the Opportunity to take the Money out of the Box. Charnock Hayward depos'd, That he being upon the Stairs, did, through the Banisters of the Stair-Case, see the Prisoner, while the Boy was gone down to draw the Brandy, open the Money Box, and take out Money. The Constable depos'd, That he being on the Stairs did see the Prisoner go behind the Counter and take the Money out of the Till, that thereupon he came down immediately and siez'd him, and took 12 Shillings out of his Pocket, and that upon examining the Draw, there was just 28 Shillings left in it, wanting just the 12 Shillings that was found upon him. The Prosecutor depos'd, that these Shillings so taken upon the Prisoner, were those that he had mark'd on purpose to make the Experiment. The Prisoner however deny'd the Fact. But the Fact being too plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               guilty

             depos'd, the Prosecutor came to him, to acquaint him with the Robbery; that he inquiring of him the manner of the committing the Robbery, he told the Prosecutor, the Secret lay in his own Family: That however he promising to serve him as far as he could, his Daughter came to him to show him some other Plate, to see the Arms or Graving that was upon it, and that while she was there a Messenger came from

            , who was not then a Prisoner there, but was only gone thither to see one of her Acquaintance; that knowing she was a Dealer in bad Money, and seeing her have something that he thought was Money, he told her he wanted to see what Money she had; to which she reply'd, if that was all she was safe enough, for hers was good Money, and show'd it him, which was about 6 l. That then he secur'd her in the Compter. That Gardiner informing him that Garraway was at Nan Gill's Lodging, having hurt himself, that he was lame, he went thither and found him, and afterwards by his Information took Sly in Grubstreet, and afterwards carry'd them before Sir

             depos'd, that Jeremiah Garraway told him, he had a rich Unkle that liv'd in Lothbury (the Prosecutor being interrogated, answer'd he was his Wife's Sister's Son) and that as they were taking a Walk in the Fields they met Nan Gill, and she offer'd to treat them with a Pot of Drink; that they went in to drink, but Sly refus'd to go in, and that they had two Pots of Drink, and a Quartern of Geneva; that there they discoursed of the intended Robbery, and Nan Gill ask'd what Quantity of Plate there was, and Garraway answer'd, To the Value of about 30 l. That he this Evidence said, that if they did get it, he did not know where to sell it; but Nan Gill took that upon her. That Garraway, Sly, and himself, went together about 9 a Clock at Night to the Prosecutor's House, and Garraway bid them go in and cheapen a pair of Gold Scales, telling them there was a Key that went into a Pin in such a Place of a Cellar-door, bidding them take an Opportunity to pull it out: That they did go in, but could not get an Opportunity to pull it out; and coming out and telling him so, he swore they were a couple of Fools . That then Garraway went in himself, and supp'd with his Cousins, and when he came out told them he had pull'd the Key out of the Pin, and made all things ready to get in. That then he went in again, and said about half an Hour; that then they went into Moorfields, and walk'd about till after 11 a Clock, and came to the House again at almost 12, but Sly espying a Light in the House, they walk'd about till almost one a Clock; and supposing all then to be fast asleep, Sly pull'd out the Pin, took out the Bar and Garraway went in, and in half an Hour brought out the Plate, and gave the Tankard and Salver to Sly, and that the Plate being dispos'd to each of them some, they would have gone out at Cripplegate, but did not dare to adventure, because of the Watch; that then going to Moorgate, where there was but one Watchman, there Sly went through first, and in about half a quarter of an Hour Garraway and he this Evidence went through into Moorfields, and thence to Nan Gill's where being let in, they set the Plate down on the Table, and Nan Gill poising it in her Hand, said it was but light, and so would not fetch a great deal, but as she judg'd about 7 l. s but telling them she would sell it for them, and would not wrong them of a half Peny, that she did go to sell the Plate, but he saw her no more till she was secured. The Prisoners deny'd the Fact, and call'd some to their Reportation. Some depos'd they knew Garraway, that he had kept a Turner's Shop in Fenchurch-street, which he left off about New-Years-Day last. The Fact being thus plainly prov'd, the Jury found them 


               guilty of the Felony in stealing the Plate, but acquitted them of the Burglary

 to dig in the Ruins of the late Fire in Billiter Lane


, that finding a Bale of Silk, they did conceal it, and offer'd it to Sale as their own Goods. Oliver pleaded he was employ'd by Graham, and that he ordered him to conceal the Silk, and he being a Country Fellow, but newly come to Town, he impos'd on his Ignorance so as to be concern'd in the concealing and selling it. Graham pleaded, that he and another Person had contracted with Mr. Foxly a Merchant, to give him a certain Sum of Mony for what Yarn of his they could dig out, that was not entirely burnt, but had been damag'd by the Fire, and that Oliver in digging, found a Bale of Silk, did carry it to his House unknown to him, and deny'd his being concerned in offering it to Sale.

               guilty

The Prosecutor depos'd, That he having been in the Service of Merchant Forward, had been to receive his Money for the Voyage; and as he was going in Stepney Fields, near the Half-way House, met with the Prisoner, who ask'd him to spend a Penny with her, that thereupon he went in to the Yard of the Half-way-House with her, and far down in one of the Boxes, where they drank a Pot of Drink, and a Bottle and Pint; that he taking out his Pouch, where in were both his Tobacco and Money, to fill a Pipe, the Prisoner had the Opportunity of seeing his Gold, that having fill'd his Pipe he put his Pouch again into his Pocket; and having stay'd there drinking with the Prisoner about Half an Hour, he paid the Reckoning, having other Money in his Pocket, and came away, the Prisoner going out of the Door that was towards London, and he at that towards Stepney; and in a Minute's Time feeling for his Pouch, miss'd it, and returned back immediately, but could not get sight of her; but enquiring of the People of the House, had an Account of her, but could never light on her till a Month after, that he heard she was committed to New Prison for another Fact. He was positive the Prisoner must take his Pouch and Money, he being at that Time very sober, and there being no Person in this Company but the Prisoner, who sat by him in the Box, tho' he had no Familiarity with her, but in the way of Talk and Drinking together, thinking it to be an Act of Charity to give her a Pot of Drink, and that he did not so much as kiss her Lips, nor feel her any where at all, while they were together, but he did suppose she took the Pouch as they were rising up to go away. The Prisoner's Defence was, That as she was going along the Back Lane from Rag Fair, with a Basket of Oysters, the Prosecutor took her hold by her Arm, telling her, she was very like a young Woman whom he Courted seven Years ago, and would have had her gone in with him no drink at the Sign of the Ship, but she refus'd; that he still went along with her, and offer'd her two Shillings to let him lie with her, but she would not consent to any such Thing, upon which the Prosecutor abus'd her, and threw down her Basket of Oysters, calling her Names, telling her he had been with a Bitch that had robb'd him of his Money; and if she would not let him he with her, he would swear the Robbery to her. But the Prosecutor deny'd all she said, and that she had any Oysters or Basket either. She not being able to give any Proof of what she said, or to call any one Person to her Reputation, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

That he gave Notice to

John Hare deposed, That he having given the Constable Notice, he went and brought her to the Watch-house, and asking her for the Money, she replied, it was in her private Parts; she dropped 2 Guineas and a half from her, and had half a Crown and some Half pence in her Pocket.

             the Constable depos'd, That the Watchman giving him Notice, that the Prisoner had got a great deal of Gold, and that they believed she had picked some Body's Pocket, he went with some Watchmen to her Lodgings, and the Night being still, and they making no Noise, heard a Woman's Voice in the Prisoner's Room say, I am sorry you have miss'd the Watch. That the Prisoner (for he knew her Voice) answered, no matter, I have got all his Gold; and said, you Bitch, go get me a Coach, I'll give you a Guinea. That a Person, he supposes a sort of a Servant, going out of Doors, he put in his Staff, and went in, and took her to the Watch-house, and examining her where the Money was, she would not own having any Money; but he ordering the Watch to search her, she said the Money was not in her Pocket, but it was in her Privy Parts (but she made use of the plain Name.) And saying, that she was not as she ought to be, and not fit to be search'd, but if they would let her alone she would search her self, they did permit her, then she stoop'd down, and putting her Hand under her Coats, a Guinea dropped on the Ground, afterwards half a Guinea, and then another Guinea; and he saw that she had nothing in her hand before. That he saw no more Money, but half a Crown in her Pocket, and some Half pence, &c. which she said was her own, and they gave that to her again; but he did suspect that at the same Time that she pretended to pull out the 2 Guineas and a half, she did put the rest further up, because she afterwards owned there were 6 or 7 more in the same Place, and owned, that as she was standing at Stone-Cutters Alley


, a Gentleman came to her, and asked her, what she stood there for? She told him, she stood there to wait for Money and good Company; whereupon he laid her down on the Stones, and lay with her, and while he was Doing her over, she put her Hand into his Pocket and took some Silver; and having a mind to try farther, she put her Fingers into his Fob Pocket, and took out his Gold, and then she thought she was at home; and when he had done with her, she told him she could not stay, and so went away from him. And added, That the Gentleman told her that he had never been better pleased by any Woman in his life. The Constable also deposed, That he put an Advertisement into the News, and a Person came and demanded the Money, but said it was not his, but a Gentleman's that would not appear. Upon which he told him, the Person must come himself, and give some Satisfaction the Money was his, because there were some Expressions between the Prisoner and Gentleman at that Time, which had been communicated to him, and would be Tokens that he was the Owner thereof. The Prisoner, before she began her Defence, demanded the 2 Guineas and a half that were in the Constable's Hands, promising, that then she would give an Account how she came by the Money. The Judge promising, that if she did give a good Account of it she should have it, she gave the following Account: That as she was, about 8 a Clock at Night in Great Queen-street and had just been drinking a Dram or two, a Gentleman came up to her, and took hold of her, and took her Stick out of her Hand, and she desired him to let her alone, and give her her Stick, for she was dark sighted, and could not go home without it; that then he laid her down upon the Ground, or Stone at a Gentleman's Door; that she cried out, and he thrust his Hand in his Pocket and gave her a whole handful of Money, as much as her Hand would hold, and then 2 Men coming by making a Noise, the Gentleman went away and left her. Then afterwards she did go to Isham's House, and called for Geneva, and did show the Money to him, to know what it was being dark sighted, and being glad to hear it was Gold, gave him a Crown Bowl of Punch, bought a Riding Hood, and other Clothes of his Wife, for her Rigging before was very mean. That she did give the Watchman a Shilling to light her home, and paid her Landlady a Guinea, she owing her Money, and in the interim of the Time the Constable and Watch came and carried her to the Watch-house, and took her Money from her. The Fact being plainly proved, the Jury found her

, the Prisoner ran against him, and took the Handkerchief out of his Pocket. Mr.Shrimpton saw him commit the Fact, seiz'd him, and he being searched, 4 other Handkerchiefs were found upon him.

             , on the 17th of November
 last. John Penny, Constable
, depos'd, that between One and Two in the Morning, the Prisoner was brought to him at the Watch-house, with a Bundle and a Box, and said that her Husband had beat her, and taken another Woman to Bed, and so she catch'd up those Things to secure them at a Friend's House. He bid her send for somebody to her Reputation, which she did, and two Women came and gave her the Character of an honest Woman, and that they believed the Goods were her own. However, he carry'd her and her two Friends before the Justice, who finding nothing proved against her, discharged her. They then went to drink together, and afterwards came to his House, where she sent for three Quarts of Twopenny to treat him and her two Friends. While they were drinking, he was call'd out, and at his Return found her at Dinner with his Wife. Mrs. Penny deposed, that after her Husband was gone, a Neighbour came in, who having some Knowledge of the Prisoner, fell into Discourse with her; but in a little time the Prisoner appear'd to be very drunk, and tumbled out of the Chair; she rais'd her again, carried her up Stairs, laid her upon the Bed, and very considerately set a Chamber-Pot by her, for fear she might have Occasion to make Water. This done, she left her, and in about half an Hour after, thinking she heard her rising, went up to see how she did, and found her kneeling on the Bed, with the Chamber-Pot betwixt her Legs. She seem'd to be a little recover'd, and upon Persuasion came down to Dinner, and after Dinner went away. Next day this Evidence miss'd her Linnen, and suspecting the Prisoner, enquired after her of the Neighbour that accidentally met with her the day before; by which means she found her, charged her with the Felony, and had her before Justice Kirby, to whom she confess'd that she stole the Goods, part of which were found upon her, and the rest at Pawn. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that the Prosecutor's Daughter came up Stairs, and beg'd her to pawn those three Smocks for her, and bring her the Money. She pawn'd them accordingly, and intended to bring her the Money next day; but being very busy, was prevented. It appear'd very unlikely that the Prosecutor's Daughter should, on such a short Acquaintance, put so much Confidence in the Prisoner, especially when she saw her in such ill Circumstances. The Jury found her 

               guilty

, to buy a Cross-Knot; at which time she saw the Prisoner take the Goods in the Indictment, and go away; but having no body to take care of her Shop, she did not pursue her, for fear the others in the mean time should rob her of something more valuable: But two Weeks after, she saw the Prisoner again, and causing her to be apprehended, she confess'd she had pawn'd them for 2s. at a Chandler's Shop in Plumb-Tree Court in Holborn; at which Place the Goods were found.

Vergow, the Prosecutor's Servant, who was in the Back-Shop, came out and told him, they did not use to sell such small Quantities; with which Answer the Prisoner went away, and Vergow immediately missing his Master's Hat, and his own, (both which before hung on the Pegs in the Shop) he pursued the Prisoner. His Master's Hat, with four more, he found in a Basket which the Prisoner had on his Shoulder, and his own Hat under the Prisoner's great Coat.

. last, receive, comfort, and harbour the said John Sheppard
            . It appeared that after Sheppard's first Escape from Newgate, several of the Keepers, Mr. Rouse, Mr. Langly, Mr. Alston, Mr. Ireton, and others, 3 in a Coach, and as many on Horseback, rode to Finchly in pursuit of him, they having heard that he had been seen thereabouts, in Company with the Prisoner, (who was a Clare-Market Butcher) that they were both dressed in Butchers Frocks. Mr. Langly coming upon Finchly Common, quickly spy'd the Prisoner and Sheppard together; and they perceiving him, struck off into the Fields. Upon which he quitted his Horse, and ran after them, and took the Prisoner, and searching him, found a Chissel in his Pocket. Mr. Alston leaped his Horse over a Style, and rid after Sheppard, who ran round a Farm-House, and at last hid himself in a Barn, where, after some Search, Mr. Alston took him, and found under his Armpits 2 of the Watches that he (Sheppard) in Company with the Prisoner, snatched out of Mr. Martin's Shop. The Prisoner confes'd to them, that he had kept Sheppard Company ever since he broke out of Newgate. That Ireland, who was one that assisted Shepard in getting out of the Condemn'd-Hold, and who has since absconded himself, told him that Sheppard was at the Paul's Head in Spittle-Fields. He (the Prisoner) went thither to see him, and there they agreed to go to a Relation of the Prisoner's who lived at Wandham beyond Woburn. They went together, staid there a Week, then came back to London; and hearing that a Reward was offered for taking Sheppard, they retreated to Finchly. Mr. Ireton depos'd, that he lost his Handkerchief the same Night that Mr. Martin lost his Watches, and seeing the Prisoner near him, he charged him with it. The Prisoner said he knew nothing of the Handkerchief, but if he wanted Jack Sheppard, he was but just gone before. He went the Way that the Prisoner directed him, but could not find Sheppard, for Sheppard (as he since heard) hid himself at that time under a Coach in the Street.

, and bought a Pack of Cards. They gave her a Guinea to change, and observing the Woman to look very much about the Shop, and now and then to laugh upon the Man, She suspected the Guinea was not good, and was unwilling to change it; but Dun tore the Cover off the Cards, which made them untie for Sale, if she had taken them again. So that at last she gave the Change to Dun, who told it over several times. She lighted them out, and shut fast the Hatch and the Door after them, and went backwards; but soon after, some body knock'd at the Door; and when she opened it, she saw 2 of her Neighbours with Vaughan, the Prisoner, and a Parcel of her Goods which had just been taken out of her Shop.

             depos'd, that going to drink at a Friend's House, they saw 2 Men and a Girl whispering together at the End of an Alley, opposite to Norman's Shop. Says Hall, I don't like the Looks of those Fellows; I believe they are Bailiffs. Prithee, John, step over and observe 'em. It being a Moon-light Night, he went by them, looked wishful in their Faces; and returning to Hall, told him, that they looked more like Thieves than Bailiffs. Upon this they watch'd 'em, and by and by they saw Vaughan go along with a Bundle upon his Shoulder. They stopt him. He cry'd out, Thieves! Rogues! do you design to rob me? They told him they knew who those  Goods belong'd to. Are they yours, says he? No, said they, but we can bring you to the right Owner quickly. Gentlemen, be but easy, and you shall go Halves. No, we will have all. All? What won't you leave me one Cap? Pray, Gentlemen, let me have but a Cap, and take the rest betwixt you. They carried him back with the Goods to Mrs. Norman. Quin ran away; but he and Dun were both taken next day. The Prisoners then made their Defence. Vaughan own'd that he had the Goods, but said that he found'em under a bench next Door to Norman's. Quin said he was at Ipswich when the Robbery was committed, but brought no body to prove it. A Picklock was found in his Pocket; and he was an Evidence at a former Sessions.

In her Defence at the Bar, she said, that her Master gave her the Cloaths and Money too, for Favours that he often desired of her, when he came to her Bed-side in the Morning to call her up: But for the greater Secrecy, he bade her take a Lodging in some Place where he might conveniently visit her. But she going, and not sending him Word where she was, and he finding her out by chance, prosecuted her in Spight. She own'd that she did not make this Defence when she was first apprehended; but that (she said) was only because she was then unwilling to disgrace her Master.

            , thus depos'd: I had been drinking part of two or three Pints of Wine, besides other Liquors, at Mr. Lewis's, the Bull-Head at Tottenham Court; from whence, about Three in the Afternoon, I came into Shoo-Lane


, where the Prisoner lived. I had seen her several times before; and the last time I was with her, she made me promise to call upon her when I came that Way; and so I was willing to be as good as my Word. When I came in, she was in Company with two or three more Women; but they went away. I felt her Hand about my Breeches, and ask'd if she had a mind to pick my Pocket. We drank Brandy; and I went away at Five o'Clock. I did not miss my Watch till I came to Smithfield; and then I went back and demanded it. She deny'd it, began to call me Names, and was for pushing me out of Doors. I consider'd that it grew late, and that I had eight Miles home to Whetstone; and so I left her for that time. I came again next Saturday, and threatned to fetch a Constable and send her to Newgate; and then she told me, if I'd give her a Guinea, she'd help me to it again; But I would not comply to that, tho' I could not tell what Course to take; for I did not care to tell any body, for fear my Wife should hear of it. So I went home and consider'd of it, and came again next Saturday, and then she took me to the Eagle and Child, where

            , her pretended Husband, and two or three more Women, came to her; and then she told me that the Watch was in Pawn for a Guinea; and except I would give that, I should never have it. So I was forced to treat 'em, and go without my Watch too, which I was not very well pleas'd withall. Whereupon, I began to think with myself, This wicked Jade puts upon me, because she sees that I am a Man in Tears, and don't much care to have the thing known; but that shan't save her, for I'll tell my Wife of it myself. So home I goes, and tells her that I had committed a great Fault, which I was very sorry for, but I would make her Amends for time to come; and then I let her know the whole Concern. Mrs. Odell thus depos'd; I went with my Husband to the Prisoner, and demanded his Watch. The Prisoner told me it was at Pawn; and if I'd give a Guinea to redeem it, I should have it; but otherwise, not. Upon this Confession, and Refusal, I sent for a Constable, and gave him Charge of her.

             the Constable thus depos'd; I heard the Prisoner own that the Watch was pawn'd, and the Money spent; and as I was going with her to the Justice's, she would needs call in at an Alehouse, where, when we had sat down a little while, a Woman, who was one of her Neighbours, came in with something wrapt in a Paper, and laid it on the Table, and went away again. We open'd the Paper, and found the Prosecutor's Watch.

I had formerly, by means of an Advertsement, stop a Tankard that was stolen from Mr. Walden, at the Three Tuns in Portsmouth; and finding the Initial Letters of his Name upon this that the Prisoner had, I suspected that it came from the same Place. I question'd the Prisoner about it. He told me it I was uneasy, he would quickly bring some of his Neighbours to his Reputation, for he lived but hard-by. In about half an Hour he returned with two Women, who said that he was a very honest Man, and that it was his Business to buy old Silver. This did not satisfy me. I charged a Constable with him, and forthwith wrote to Mr. Walden, advising him that I had stopt a Piece of Plate, but neither mentioned that it was a Tankard, nor what Marks it had. He returned me an Answer the next Post, that he had lost a Tankard of such a Weight, such Marks, and described the suspected Person: All which Particulars agreed with the Prisoner and this Tankard.

Next Morning he came again, drank and smoak'd as before, and went out, and returned in the Afternoon, and called for t'other Tankard and Pipe. Soon after he was gone, we miss'd the Tankard, but never saw after him any more.
The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he bought the Tankard for 2 s. l5 s. on the Road from Portsmouth near Port Down

John Trewicks thus deposed: 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Hill 
               



             (with whom I had a small Acquaintance) brought the Prisoner a Visiting to my House one Sunday Night. While she was there, we mist a Snuff Box off the Tea-Table; but thought it improper to take any Notice of it at that time. When the Company was gone. I and my Wife look'd for it diligently, but all to no purpose. She came again in a few days, and then we lost a Pair of Silk Stocking off the Back of a Chair. This gave us a strong Suspicion, and therefore we invited her to Supper another time, on purpose to detect her. She came, and we before-hand had hung an Apron, a Handkerchief, and a Turn-over, upon the Back of a Chair. The Apron was presently mist; we charged her with taking it: She deny'd it stiffly, and we were resolved to search her. Mr. Hill and I went out of the Room, and left her to my Wife and two more young Women; but first we desired the Prisoner and every one else to look narrowly all over the Parlour, to be satisfied that the Apron was not there; which every one did.
The Woman deposed, that the Prisoner stript herself to her Under-Petticoat; and then told them, that her Modesty would not let her go any farther to expose her Nakedness; but they not being satisfy'd with such a Pretence, she lifted up her Petticoat and Smock together. They still insisted upon having the Petticoat quite off. Then she unty'd it, and in stooping down they perceiv'd her to throw something white under the Table: They took it up, and found it to be the Apron.
The Prisoner in her Defence said, that it was all Spight; and that Trewicks told her he'd make it up, if she'd either give him 30 s. or stand stark naked for a Week together at the seven Dials. She called up several Witnesses to speak in her Behalf, and the Prosecutor produced others against her. The Sum of their Evidence on both sides was, That she was a Gentlewoman of very good Repute, was industrious and careful in the Maintenance of her Family; that she had often been entrusted with Goods and Money to a considerable Value, and always preserv'd her Credit without Blemish: But that she was one of the greatest Lyars in Life, an idle, lazy, cheating, pilfering, drunken Puss; that she had three Husbands; and had in general the worst Character that could be given to a Woman.

She ask'd me 4 s. a Pair, and presently fell to 2 s. and said, if I would give that, she would fetch the whole Bundle, and the Man that own'd them. This made me believe that she did not come honestly by them; and therefore I desired her to go for the rest, but to bring them as privately as she could. In the mean time I sent for a Constable; but White, and the other Prisoner Grey, with a great Bundle of Stockings, were with me before him. In order to detain them till the Constable came, I made them tell over the Stockings, set down the Prices separately, and then cast them up. The Men's he allow'd at 2 s. Boys at 6 d. and Childrens at 3 d. At these Prices they came to 4 l. 16 s. in all. I told them they must abate the odd 16 s. but Grey said he could not afford it. You can if you will, says I. But who do they belong to? Perhaps I may come into Trouble about them. There is no Fear of that, says Grey, the Goods are mine, and I will bear you Harmless. By this time, my Husband and the Constable came in. Grey look'd very shy upon them, and whisper'd me to take the Goods at my own Price, and let him go But we secured them both.

                  , on the 20th of June



 last, about the Hour of two in the Night
            .
Mary Rans thus deposed: On the 15th of June I went to Bed about Twelve, and left all my Doors and Windows fast. I was called up about four, and found my House broke open; two Panes of Glass were taken out of the front Window, and six in the middle Windows, which had Shutters without Side and within; but both were broke open, and the Goods in the Indictment taken away. Not long ago, 
               
                  John 
                  Everet 
               



             came to my House, and told me, if I would apply to one 
               
                  John 
                  Bewle 
               



             in New Prison, I might hear of my Goods again. I went: Bewle ask'd me if I had lost such Goods, and could swear to them; and then told me, that he had sold them to Susan Belcher.


                  Sarah 
                  Lear 
               



             thus deposed: About ten Weeks ago, I went to Bed about Eleven, and left all fast. I was called up again about Two, and found my House broke open, the middle Shutter taken down, and the Sash thrown up. I then lost this Quilt, a Hat, and Petticoat; and recovered it again by the Means of Bewle, who directed John Everet and 
               
                  Quilt 
                  Arnold 
               



             where to fetch it.


                  John 
                  Hedges 
               



             thus deposed: On the 26th of June, between Ten and Eleven at Night, I made all fast, and went to Bed; and rising about Five next Morning, I found both the outer and inner Doors of my Cellar broke open; and that several Shirts, Smocks, a Handkerchief, and other things, were lost out of a Tub of Water; some of which I got again by the Instructions of Bewle.


                  John 
                  Bewle 
               



             thus deposed: I have known Jack Little about three Months: My first Acquaintance with him was by means of his Wife Betty, for I have known her longer. Jack, (says she to me one Wednesday) I know a young Fellow that wants a Companion to go a House-breaking with: Do ye, says I? Why then I am his Man. Let me see him. She soon brought us together. We presently struck a Bargain, and broke open 2 or 3 Houses that very Night. On the Friday Night following, betwixt 11 and 12, we entred the House of Mr. Rans, over against the Sugar-Loaf in Virginia-Street





. I remember there was double Shutters to the Windows. I hoisted Jack Little upon my Shoulder; he took out several Panes of Glass, and so opened the shutters, went in, and took out the Goods. There was two Gowns, a Velvet Scarf, several Dozens of Wig Cauls, and other things. About a Week after we broke open Mr. Dear's House in Gravel-Lane





 about One in the Morning. We cut away with a Hatcher, the Runner so far, that one of the Shutters fell upon my Head, and had like to have killed me. We only took a Quilt, a Hat, and a Petticoat from thence; for the Watch coming their Rounds, prevented us. The next Week we broke open Hedgers's House about Midnight, and took, Linnen out of a Tub of Water. The Linnen, the Cauls; and most of the other things we sold to Mother Belcher, who very well knew how we came by them.
Belcher, in her Defence, deny d that she ever bought any thing of either Little or Bewle; but said, that Bewle had own'd that he sold those Goods to one Roger. In Answer to which. Bewle did not deny but that he had sold some things to Roper; but insisted upon it, that he sold the greatest Part to the Prisoner Belcher.

John Little, in his Defence, said, that he never had any Acquaintance with Bewle. But this was proved otherwise by Quilt Arnold and 
               
                  John 
                  Everet 
               



            .
Quilt Arnold thus deposed: While Bewle was in New-Prison, I and Everet found these two Pick-lock Keys upon him; and he expecting to be made an Evidence against Little, desired us to go and take him in Ratcliff. Bewle's Wife (with a Child in her Arms) went with us to set him. And as soon as we had taken him, he said, he was sorry that he did not kill Bewle's Wife and Child, for his Life was gone, now Bewle was made an Evidence.
John Everet thus deposed: When we took Little, he would fain have got away, but we brought him to New-Prison; and as soon as he saw Bewle there, he (the Prisoner) said to him, I little thought, Jack Bewle, that you would have served me so. We took this Handkerchief upon 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Little 
               



            's Neck. It is that that was stoln from Mr. Hedges.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Little 
               



            , in her Defence said, that she had it from Bewles's Wife. John Little was found 

               Guilty of all the three Indictments
            . 


               Death

            .

It appeared that Edward Wilks was Servant

It appear'd that about Eight at Night, the Prosecutor's Wife having just served a Customer, was going out of the Shop into the Kitchen, when she heard a Noise behind her, and turning back, saw the Prisoner with the Drawer in his Hand. He ran out; she cry'd, Stop Thief. He was pursued by some Neighbours; and finding himself in Danger, he threw the Drawer down, and cry'd Stop Thief as well as they; but then it was of no Service to him, for he was presently taken.

William Turner thus deposed: I keep the Horns Alehouse at Essex-Stairs




: My Back-Window looks into the Thames. My House was broke open, and a Saucepan stole away, the 18th of July; and I suppose the Entrance was made at that Sash-Window. I am not sure whether or no I had made fast the Shutter of that Window when I went to Bed that Night; but I am sure I did on the 22d of the same Month, on which Night my House was broke open a 2d time, and three Chamber-Pots taken away. The Prisoner Sculthorp was a Waterman, and ply'd at my Door. He usually drank at my House, and knew where every thing lay.

She sat down to read, and so I left her; and neither saw nor miss'd the Bible till Thursday, and then I ask'd her what she did with it? She said she put it upon her Partner's Bed on the Monday Morning; but it could not be found. I sent for a Constable, and had her before a Justice, thinking that might bring her to confess what she had done with it; but she deny'd it stiffly; and as I could not prove it upon her, the Justice discharged her. The next Day she arrested me for Scandal; and I was forced to carry my Cloaths to pawn, to pay the Charges. I beg'd of the Pawnbroker to let me have as much as ever she could upon my Things, because I was arrested. She ask'd me for what? I told her it was for charging a Woman with taking a Bible that was lost. A Bible, says she; What was the Woman's Name? Rachel, says I. Rachel! And what besides Rachel? says she. Why Pearson, says I. Ay, says she; And do you know the Bible when you see it? Yes, says I. Why then, says she, I'll shew you a Bible that was pawn'd here in the Name of

That she gave them a Groat a Pound for the Alehouse Pots, and said she must melt them for fear the owners Name upon them should occasion a Discovery, that for the same Reason she order'd the Leaden Flower Pots which were gilded, to be cut to pieces in the Cellar, and gave them 7 s. for them, they weigh'd a Hundred Weight. She call'd several of her Neighbours, who gave her a good Character, and the Jury

             on the 13th of November
.
The Prosecutors Wife thus depos'd. The Prisoner who is a Coachman
 set me down at my Door, and gave me his Hand to help me out of the Coach. My Pocket was on that Side next him. As I stept down, I felt a sort of a switch as if some part of my Cloths had catch'd hold of the Coach. My Maid came to the Door with a Candle. The Prisoner was going to drive away without his Fare. I mist my Pocket, and charg'd him with it. He deny'd it. But I insisting that I had it in the Coach, he came down and he look'd for it; We found it in the Coach; my Maid was going to take it up, but he pusht his Arm forward, and took it up. I saw it was dirty, and ask'd him how he could say that he knew nothing of it, when it was so plain that it had been in the Dirt, and afterwards was put into the Coach. He told me that he did indeed take it up in the Street, and throw it into the Coach, but he thought it had been his Corn Bag. Then turning the Pocket upside down, he shook my Watch and Money into the Street upon which Words arising, my Husband came to the Door. The Prosecutors Maid confirm'd the latter Part of is Evidence.
The Prosecutor thus depos'd. I sent for a Constable, upon which the Prisoner began to be uneasy, and desir'd to speak with me in the Parlour; but my Wife and Maid following, he said Nothing, but taking the Candle, went round to the farther Side of the Coach, and open'd that Door, desir'd me to look under the Cushion, which I did; but yet having an Eye upon him, I saw him stoop two or three Times, and to my thinking lay something down on the Coach Floor, and then immediately holding the Candle to the Place where his Hand had been, See Sir, says he, here lies the Money. - I seiz'd him, a Mob began to gather, he got from me and ran away; but in about two Hours after, he return'd and demanded his Fare.
At one Time when he was examin'd, he said that the Money dropt into his Shoes; and at another Time that they fell only upon his Shoes; he could not tell how they got into the Coach afterwards. Several Witnesses gave him a good Character, and the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner had been my Lodger about a Month. When one Night while I was a Bed I heard a Noise below Stairs where my Chest stood. So I call'd out who's there! The Prisoner answer'd, 'Tis I Landlady I am only looking for a Pot to warm some Beer. By and by he comes up into my Room, and takes all the Money out of my Pocket; then he went into the Closer, cut a Slice of Mutton, and went down Stairs again; next Morning I found my Chest broke open and my Money gone. The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I never had any Thing of what I am charged with, but the Rings, and I came by them honestly. For when I came to lodge with this old Women, she fell in Love with me; she has got a Husband indeed, but he's at Carolina. One Day she invited me to go with her to Stepney to take a Treat of Cakes and Ale, and I went; and while we were drinking together, I had Occasion to go to the Necessary House, which was at the farther End of the Yard; I was no sooner got thither, but she came in after me - and we were very merry together, and the gave me the Rings for my Pains, and so we came home again. At Night I went up Stairs, and she follow'd me. We had several hot Pots together, I went to Bed while she was in the Room, and she undrest herself, came into Bed to me; and because I did not satisfied her, she swore this Robbery against me, tho' I never did an ill Thing in my Life.

, and its well known that I work hard for my Money, and so as I was saying, betwixt one and two a Clock in the Morning, - and a Mortal cold Night it was, - I am sure I have good Cause to remember it; for as I was coming by the Corner of Bennets Court, in Drury-Lane


; who should I meet but the Prisoner? and so says she, How dye do my Dear, - 'tis bloody cold Weather, - I wish you'd give me a Dram. Whereof, says I again, I don't care if I do, if we can come to a good Fire, and so - what signifies lying - we struck a Bargain, and went to a Gin Shop, and I thought I had better do so than wander about the Street all Night, tho' I must needs say, I might as well have gone home to any Wife, - but that's neither here nor there, - I was got a little in for't and when I am once in, I never mind which End goes foremost, and its many a poor Mans Case as well as mine. And so Sir the Reckoning came to 8 d. and I had got a Brass Box in my Pocket, with 2 Guineas in it, and a Note upon Command for 6 Pounds 6 Shillings, and some other odd Matters. Whereof I takes out this Box, in order to pay the Shot. Now whether she saw the Money in my Box, or did not see it, I can't be positive, she mought or she mought not, but howsoever I gave my Landlady a Shilling to change, and put up my Box again, and some other People came in to drink; and by and by my Landlady brings me a Groat, and so I went out with the Groat in my Hand, and Phillis along with me; and I goes to put my Money up, and mist my Box, and so I call'd the Watch, and carried her to the Round-House.
The Prosecutors Wife, and several others, depos'd that they searched the Prisoner in the Round-House, and found the Box, and the Note upon her, but none of the Money.
The Prisoner thus made her Defence. It being a cold Night, I went into a Gin Shop for a Dram of Anniseed, and there I saw this Gosling a drinking along with a Parcel of Bunters, and he was got very drunk, and fain would have been rude with me. But never caring to make my self familiar with any such Fellows; I went out, and he followed me, and thrust me up against the Wall, and there he pull'd out his Pistol, and swore he'd let fly at me, if I would not let him ravish me. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

The Witnesses thus depos'd. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hains 
               



             lives at Rochester, and takes in Goods to dye, which she gets done at London. In April last, she sent a Hamper of Goods for that purpose, under the Care of her Father 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Raymond 
               



            , and he being to go from Graves-End in the Tilt-boat, she provided as much Beef as she thought sufficient for the Voyage, and tying it up in a Pudding Bag, packt it securely in the Hamper. It was about one of the Clock in the Morning when Mr. Raymond came to Billings-Gate. He had scarce landed when he was ply'd by a Waterman, (but he cannot swear that it was the Prisoner) with whom he agreed to go to Kings-Bridge, Westminster


. He observed the Number of the Boat, took his Hamper in and away they row'd, and quickly came to Kings-Bridge. Mr. Raymond stept on Shore, and the Waterman went abast, and said he'd bring the Hamper out, but instead of that he row'd away. By the Number of the Boat Mr. Raymond found out the Owner of it, tho' to but little Purpose; for says the Owner, My Boat was stole the same Night that you lost your Hamper, and I suppose by the same Rogue too. About 2 a Clock, on the same Morning that the Hamper was lost, the Prisoner came to the House of Mr. Clark, in Ashen-Tree-Court, in White-Fryers; where he was let in by 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Spur 
               



            , who was then Nurse in that House. He brought a Hamper with him, which he open'd; and Mrs. Spur saw it was packt with Silk and other Goods prepared for Dying, which made her suspect that they were stoln. The Prisoner took them away again the same Morning, but however she desir'd her Landlord to enquire among the Callenders and Dyers, if no such Goods were lost, which he did, and heard of Mr. Raymond's Misfortune, at Mr. Crew's in Black-Fryers; who (as it happen'd) was the Prosecutors Callender. The Prisoner was traced out and apprehended, and the Goods found at the Baptist's-Head, in White-Cross-Street, where he had pawn'd them.
The Bag was produced in Court, and sworn, by Mrs. Spur to be the same the Prisoner brought to Mrs. Clark's House; and Mrs. Hains swore it was the same in which she wrapt up her Father's Beef at Graves-End.
The Prisoner in his Defence own'd that he had such a Hamper of Goods, but said he came honestly by them, for he accidentally met a Stranger that gave them to him. But the Jury not being willing to take his bare Word for it, they found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

             thus depos'd, the Prisoner sold me some burnt Lace, and a pair of silver Snuffers; I melted 'em both down, but I remember the Snuffers had the same Coat of Arms, as this Silver has which is my Lord Bingly's, to whom the Prisoner was Footman
.

            , January 3


John Emerton thus depos'd. On the 3d of January in the Afternoon, the Prisoner Smith came to me, and said he wanted half an Anchor of Brandy for a Customer of his. We agreed upon a Price, and that he should pay ready Money if his Friend lik'd it, but that if it did not please, the Porter should bring it back, and he should pay the Porterage. I accordingly sent my Porter with the Cask of Brandy, and gave him strict Orders not to deliver it without Money. The Porter came back with a Cask, but instead of Brandy it was fill'd with Water.
The Porter thus depos'd. I was put the Cask of Prandy in a great Pag. and was carry it along with the Pressoner 
               
                  William 
                  Smit 
               



             to the Anchor Ale-house, in the saffy, and so ass we was coming together, honest Porter says he. If my Friend was like the Brandy, I was kive you the Money for it, put if he ton't, you was take it pack again - Tiss ferry well Sir, says I, and so we came into the House, and I pitcht my Purden upon the Taple and there was the other Pressoner Fitzpatrick, a sitting upon a Pench py the Fire, with a plue Apron on, Come Honesty, says he, sit town while you stand and call for a pint of Peer, and so I tid. And while I was trinking, Smith was take the Cask of Prandy out of the Pag, and let it in a Corner of the Room, behind a Ped or a Screen, and was traw same in a Class, and pring it to Fitzpatrick. Here Lantlort, says he, see how you was like this Prandy. So when Fitzpatrick was trink some of it. Fait now, says he, I was not like it at all, she Prandy that you prought me pefore was after pang potter as this. Inteet. says Smith. I am ferry sorry you was not like the Prandy; put since it is so, the Porter must cen carry it pack again. And so he was go to the Ped Side, and pring out my Pag with a Cask in it, and I was take it upon my Pack, and carry it home; put when I was open it, the Piffel a pit of Prandy was there, for it was full of Water.

                  Freeman 
               



             thus depos'd. I and the Prisoner Fitzpatrick are both Lodgers in the same House. On the 3d of January in the Morning, he brought an empty half Anchor into my Room, and soon after carry'd it away again. I went down into the Yard, and there I saw both him and Smith filling the same Cask with Water. Fitzpatrick told me that Smith had accidentally spilt some Brandy, and they were filling the Cask with Water again, to see how much was lost. When they had fill'd it they carried it out, but whether or no they went to the Anchor Ale-house, I cannot tell.
Mrs. - thus depos'd. The Prisoners brought this Cask of Water to our House ( Mr. Dockrell's at tho Anchor in the Savoy ) and there they blackt it, to make it look old. Smith went out, and Fitzpatrick put on a blue Apron, which I never saw him wear before, but I suppose he did it, that he might pass for the Landlord of the House. He was sitting by the Fire, when Smith return'd with the Porter, who pitch'd his Bag with a Cask in it, upon the Table; Smith took the Cask out, and carry'd it behind the Screen, while the Porter was drinking by the Fire; and afterwards I saw him put a Cask into the Porters Bag, and send him away; and as soon as the Porter was gone, Smith and Fitzpatrick carry'd out another Cask between them.
Smith thus made his Defence. I made a fair Agreement for the Brandy, and if the Distiller has been cheated, I suppose it was done by the Porter. I am sure Fitzpatrick is innocent of the Matter, for I myself know nothing of it.
Fitzpatrick made his Defence. Arra fait if I dont make my Innoshence appear, I will be after forfeiting both my Head and Ears to thish honourable Court; and in the first Plaush consherning the Cashk of Water. Why fait now, Smith only took down an empty Cashk of Water that lay upon the Ground, to shee whether or no it wash leaky; and ash I hope to be shav'd that ish all that I know of the Matter. And ash for my wearing a blue Apron, if you pleash to be after ashking any Body that knowsh it, they will tell you that I kept an Ale-house
 twelve Yearsh ago, but meeting with Mishfortunes, I wash forsh'd to leave it off, and turn Merchant
, and sho I took a Room up two pair of Stairsh. and should Brandy; and therefore I hope thish honourable Court will be after taking it into Conshideration, for I have got a Wife and four shmall Families. The Jury found them both

About 5 a Clock that Morning as Mrs. Bury was robb'd, the Prisoner and Smith knockt me up. She call'd for a Dram, and pulling out half a Dozen Tea Spoons, she kist them, and said, These were left me by my Dear, John Sheppard, and I have just fetcht them out of Pawn.
The Prisoner in her Defence said that Smith pickt her up in the Street, and gave her these Spoons to lye with her; and truly she thought she might as well earn them that Way herself, as to let another do it.

Hester Shaw thus depos'd. On Monday Night last, betwixt 7 and 8, as I was coming over London-Bridge, there was a stop of Coaches, and a great Crowd. The Prisoner jostled against me several Times, and kept very close to me. I went to see the Wax Work last Southwark Fair


, and there a Friend of mine shew'd me this Bird along with 
               
                  Betty 
                  Wells 
               



            , and told me what a sort of Fellow he was. I remembered him again, and clapt my Hand upon my Pocket for fear it should be cut, but was cautious to late, for my Pocket was cut and my Money gone, Birds Hand was then at my side, and Newmarsh stood close too him: I cry'd out, but they slipt between the Coaches and got away. I had heard that the most likely Place to find 'em at, was a scandalous House, a Harbour for Rogues in Bird-Cage-Alley, in the Mint, 'tis the Bell and 7 Stars, or the Bell and Garter, I forgot which, but 'tis kept by - Fitzgerald, and Irishman. I took Assistance, went thither and found 'em both, the same Night. 


               Guilty 10 d. 
             each.

             thus depos'd. Sir Charles kept several tame Conies, and one Morning I mist 4 Does and a Buck, and afterwards I found the Does at the Prisoner's House. The Prisoner Confess'd the Fact before Sir Charles. In this Defence at the Bar, he pretended that he bought the Rabbits, and he never did an ill Thing in his life. Sir Charles hearing this, inform'd the Court that the Prisoner had already been burnt in the Hand. The Court order'd that his Hand should be look'd on, and thereupon one of the Keepers call'd to the Executioner, Come hither Jack, says he, and see if you know your own Hand-writing. The Executioner came, and the Mark was visible.

, March 26
. Ralph Bugby thus depos'd. I lost the Corn on Sunday Night, and upon making Search I found it hid in the Prisoner's Haymow at Hendon. At first he said he had no Wheat; but when I found it, he said he bought it of a broken Farmer out of his Waggon at Bear Key, though some Folks have told me that there never are any Waggons come to Bear Key with Corn. When I found my Wheat it was not in my Sacks, but in old Sacks of his own. - When I was Searching I found a hollow Place in the Mow, and I call'd for a Fork. I'll fetch ye one, says the Prisoner, but instead of coming with it he run away; - and when he was taken again, he offer'd me 20, 30, or 40 Guineas, or any thing that I would desire to make it up. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that it was usual for want of Room to make such Places in Haymows to put Chaff, or Beans, or Corn. That he had a 10 Pounds a Year of his own, and Rented between 3 and 4 Score Pounds a Year more at Hendon, that he lived all his Life in Credit and therefore it was not likely that he should turn Thief in his old Age, to steal a quarter of Wheat.

I was with the Prisoner at Bear-Key, the last Day of January, when he bought 2 Quarters of Wheat in Sacks, which stood on the Ground, and he carry'd them home in a Cart. - 'Tis common in my Country to have such Holes in Hay-mows, to put Chaff and Peas in. Several of the Prisoner's Neighbours appear'd in his Behalf, and gave him the Character of a very honest industrious Man. The Jury found him

On the Sunday following. I took particular Notice of how much Money was then left, and lock'd it in my Drawer, and lock'd my Parlour Door, and leaving none but the Prisoner at home, I went to Church. When I came back I mist 3 Guineas more, upon which I examin'd her about it, and she at last confest, that

And at the second Time 2 Guineas, and 21 s. - After she had made this Confession, she was in a great Agony, and cut her own Throat, and then hang'd herself, but she was prevented from doing either of them effectually. I made enquiry after her Sweetheart, but could hear nothing of him. Her Confession before the Justice was read in Court, and the Jury found her

 to my Landlord Johnson) came in about 6 o'Clock, took his Master's Key, and went up Stairs: He staid about a Quarter of an Hour and then came down again, stood a little while at the Door, and went out. I Mistrusted Nothing all this Time, and when I went up Stairs, I found my Door lock'd; but I no sooner open'd it, than I saw my Drawers open. I examin'd farther, and found that my Money bag was empty'd, and my Rings and my Silver Spoons were gone. I call'd to my Landlady in a Fright, and told her I was robb'd, and she going into her Room, found that she was robb'd too.

             thus depos'd, I am a Beadle, I was along with some Constables. At the Feathers Tavern in Drury-lane, we heard a Man and some Women of the Town in the next Room, and thereupon we went in, and found the Prisoner with a Couple of Whores. He was very much in Drink, and we found a great deal of Money, Spoons and Snuff-boxes about him. We carry'd him out to the Bear-Inn, and desired the Keeper of the Tap-house, to take care of him till he was sober, and not let the Whores come near him, for fear they should plunder him; but he would not take any Charge of him, till we had taken an Account of what Money, and other Things the Prisoner had about him, which we did, and left him there.
The Keeper of the Tap thus deposed. The Morning after the Prisoner was left to my Care, he pretended that he was come away from his Father, without his Consent, and said, that he would stay still the Evening, and then go and lye at the Bell-Savage-Inn on Ludgate-hill, that he might be ready to go out with the Coach in the Morning, for he intended to go to a Relation of his in the Country; but in the mean Time, his Master the Prosecutor found him out, and I delivered to him the two Broad-pieces, the Gold Rings, and other Things that I had in Charge.

             thus depos'd. About 5 o'Clock in the Afternoon, I saw the Prisoner come out of the Prosecutor's House in St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields


. I mistrusted that he had stoln something, and follow'd him, he perceiv'd it and run. I pursu'd him into Hedge-lane, and collar'd him, and within 2 or 3 Yards of him I saw the Tea-Kettle, he fell on his Knees, and beg'd of me to let him go, but I secur'd him. The Prosecutor swore to the Tea-Kettle, and the Jury found the Prisoner 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

Thomas Hashfield thus depos'd. The Prisoner was a Chair-Woman
 in my House, and used to come once in two or three Weeks. And one Day she was sent up Stairs for a pair of Stockings, and (as she afterwards confest ) she open'd the Drawer, and took out the Goods. - Now, it so fell out that in a Day or two after, we had a Loin of Veal for Dinner, and my Wife sent the Maid up for a Silver Spoon, but down she came again, and said there was none there, and then my Wife ran up, and mist the Ring; upon which we got a Warrant to search the Prisoner's Lodging, and we found the Thousand of Pins in her Bed, and the 2 Spoons, and some of the Linnen, and a Key, that upon Tryal would open all our Drawers. - She confest that she had sold two of the Rings to Mrs. Ridley, a Goldsmith, near King Edward's Stairs, in Wapping; we went thither, but Mrs. Ridley said, we should not search her House, no, not if we had my Lord Chancellor's Warrant. Several Witnesses depos'd, That the Prisoner had hitherto born the Character of an honest, industrious Woman, but the Fact being plainly proved against her, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

The Prisoner came into my Shop along with a Gentlewoman of good Credit, who had been her Mistress, and who bought several Pieces of Linnen; and therefore I had not the least Suspicion of the Prisoner; but the Thing was found out by a Miracle, as a Body may say; for you must know, Sir, that the Floor of my Shop was a little broke, and my Man being in the Cellar, and hearing some Woman in the Shop, he peeps up this Hole in the Floor, over which the Prisoner happen'd to stand, and what should he see under her Coats, but - a - this Piece of Holland; and so up he comes, and tells me of what he had seen: We tax'd her with it, and she soon confest that she took it. The Jury found her

When I waked in the Morning I mist 6 Guineas, and charged her with taking it, but she deny'd it till the Afternoon, when I brought her before a Constable, who found it in her Stays, and then truly she said, as how she intended to give it me again, and only kept it till she had seen me safe home, for fear somebody should pick my Pocket.
Mr. Guy the Constable thus depos'd. I was sent for to an Ale-house at the Old Swan-Stairs


, and I found the Prosecutor and Prisoner who were pretty well infor't. He told me that they had been all Night on Board the Folly, and that she had pick'd his Pocket of 6 Guineas. She at first deny'd the having any Money about her, but when I threaten'd to have her stript and searched, she confest that she had 6 Guineas about her, which she found in the Bed where the Prisoner lay with her, but said that he being drunk, she took it only with a Design to take care of it for him, till he got safe home, for fear he should fall into ill Company and lose it.
The Prisoner thus made her Defence. I went to turn up the Bed where the Prisoner lay, and I found the 6 Guineas, he said were his: but I told him that that was more than I knew, for the Man that kept the Folly had been lying upon the same Bed himself just before, and they might belong to him, and therefore, says I, you shall swear'em to be yours before you shall have 'em.

I was confoundedly next, and knew not what Course to take. At last I told the Watch of it, and desired them to stop such a Woman if they met her. They said there were a great many Baudy Houses thereabouts, and they'd go with me and Search them. So they got the Constable, and we went together; - We presently came to one of them, and knockt at the Door; it was a long time before we got them to open it, but when we came in, the second Person that I saw was the Prisoner.
The Prisoner in her Defence, said that she never saw the Prosecutor in her Life, till he came and took her out of that House, where she went to receive a little Money that was due to her. That he was so drunk that he could not stand, and sometimes said that he had lost more Money, and sometimes less.

            , we went up Stairs together. I staid with her about a Quarter of an Hour, but being a little Fuddled, I can't say that we did any Thing to speak of but however she thought fit to examine my Breeches, and I finding her Hand near my Pocket; I began to suspect her, and presently mist my Goods. I tax'd her with robbing me, but she deny'd it, and up came her Bullies, and maul'd me, and beat me, and kick'd me down Stairs, and broke my Nose, and then turn'd me out of Doors, and hussel'd me up and down among the dark Alleys, that I might not find the House again, and so they left me in a most lamentable Pickle. I gave notice to several Pawn-brokers to step my Goods, by which Means I afterwards recover'd them. On Sunday Morning (which was the Day after I was robb'd) I took the Prisoner at her Lodging up 2 pair of Stairs, in the late House of the late 
               
                  Jonathan 
                  Wild 
               



            . She was committed to the Compter, and in the Afternoon she sent me Word I should have what I had left, by 4 o'Clock, if I'd stop the Prosecution. I waited till that Time, and then she put me off till the next Day, and so from one Time to another, till I was quite tired.

 by Trade, and lives in Bale Court, Fleet-Street. Now its always my way to take care of my Masters, and see them safe home, when ever I meet any of them as I go my Rounds: and so it fell out between 12 and 1 a Saturday Morning, that I see's my Master Hartrey come out of a Coach very much fuddled, and who should be up upon, but this very Gentlewoman at the Bar, Madam Blewit, or Dickenson, or Bowler, or what you please to call her, for she was Wife to them all Three at the same Time, and the two First of'em are now a hanging in Chains in St. George's-Fields. Whether he wanted a Whore, or she a Rogue, is neither here not there, but they presently laid fast hold of one another, and grew woundy loving. I found my Master was in Danger, and did all that I could to get him away. Hussy, says I, You Saucy Brimstone Toad you, what Business, have ye with my Master, let him go, or I'll call my Brother Watchman, and have ye to the Round-House directly, And, Ah Master! says I, my dear Master, come away from that Hang-in-Chains Bitch. - Yes I did call her Bitch, that I did, my Lord, and I can't deny it. - She'll certainly pick your Pocket, says I, or Serve you a worse Trick. - Come, come don't expose yourself, but all signify'd nothing, he swore she was a Girl for his Fancy, and he would go with her, and so they went together, but it had been better for him if he had taken his poor Watchman's Advice.
The Prisoner in her Defence, deny'd that she had ever seen the Prosecutor before he apprehended her, and then call'd several Witnesses, who depos'd that the Morning the Prosecutor was robb'd, he charged them with picking his Pocket, and sometimes he swore he could not tell who had done it.

When he had been gone a little while, I consider'd that my Drawers in his Room were unlock'd and so I went up to take care of my Cloths; I found him lying upon the Bed, but the 2 Women were gone and my Cloths too
The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I came from Bramton Park and the Women pick'd me up we went into an Ale House where we saw the Prosecutor with whom the 2 Women fell into discourse so that I thought they had all 3 been acquainted. The Prosecutor told me she had a Lodging to let and not being willing to go out of Town that Night; I took it of her. She carried us up to see it, and pull'd out the Drawers and shew'd the Women her Cloths; Then I went down and with the Prosecutor, and the mean while it seem the Women rob'd her.

             thus depos'd. I was got drunk, and was going home to Cats Hole in St. Catherines. In my Wastecoat Pocket I had got a pound of Hair in a Bladder, and a Pocket Book, a Pair of Gloves, and a Handkerchief in the other Pocket; and so coming under Aldgate, I saw the Prisoner Isabel Lucky before me, and I gave her a Tap upon the Shoulder, and ask'd her where she was going, and she said a little farther, and so she walked sometimes before me, and sometimes behind, till she came to Goodman's-Yard



, and there she turned down, and went into a Porch, and I after her. Well, says she, what will you give me now. Why indeed my Dear, says I again, I have got no Money at present, but if you'll oblige me so and so, I'll make ye Amends the next Time I see ye, for I live but a little Way off. Truly, says she, I can do nothing without ready Money, for I can't afford to trust. - Indeed my Dear you must for this once. - Will you be as good as your Word then? - Yes indeed I will Child. - Well then if I must, I must, and so, Sir, I laid her upon the Ground, for she was not afraid of daubing her Cloths, because she was then in as dirty a Pickle as she is in now. But however as foul as she was, I can't deny but that I did commit that filthy Sin upon her, and just in the Heat of Action, she cry'd out, The Watch, the Watch is a coming, get away and shift for your self. So I got off, and turn'd my Back upon her, and put up my Breeches, but the Watch not coming, I went to the Porch and felt for her there, but she was gone; then I felt in my Pockets, and found that all was lost. Well, says I, to my self, The Bitch had robb'd me, she has taken away every Thing that I had about me; my very Hair and Bladder and all, and I am an undone Man! So having no body to make my Apology to, I e'en walk'd home in that Condition. When she was taken, she said that she did not take the Things out of my Pocket, but found them in the Porch.

Lucky in her Defence said, that as she was going along Goodman's Yard, in the Dark, She Kick'd something soft before her, and taking it up, found it to be Hair. Jones in her Defence said that meeting Lucky, she ask'd her to drink, and desir'd her to sell the Hair for her, telling her that she had the Hair from a Sailor of her Acquaintance. Lucky was found

Mr. Flower thus depos'd. Coming cross the Market I saw the Warehouse was broke open, and going to light my Candle I saw Burnham, alias Vernham, with the 3 Flitches of Bacon on his Back; I call'd after him and ask'd where he was going with that Bacon, he made no Answer, but endeavour'd to run away, I pursued him, he threw down the Bacon, the which I tumbled over, but getting up again I overtook and seiz'd him.

                  Burnham 
               



             thus made his Defence. Last Monday Morning I came from Chatham, took Water at Gravesend, and came to the Tilt-Boat at Billinsgate, where I drank a Mug of Beer; from thence I went to Leadenhall-Market, where I met with a Man in a great Coat, who says to me, Honest Fellow will you earn 6 d. Ay, Master, says I, with all my Heart if 'tis any Thing I can do; says he to me again, tis to carry these 3 Flitches of Bacon into Smithfield, so Sir I had no sooner got them upon my Back, but a Man asks me where I was going, the Man in the great Coat crics G - d D - you Dog run after me, so I follow'd him as fast as I could, but before I could come up with him I was stopt for a Thief, and never could see him since, but I am an honest Fellow, and have serv'd his Majesty King George, God bless his Holy Name.
Then Marsh being ask'd what he had to say, proceeded as follows: I belong to the Nasaw, and being destitute of a Lodging and a little fuddled withal, I strouled into Leadenhall-Market, and laid me down on one of the Bulks, but it growing a little lighter I gets up and runs against a Place where I felt some Straw, and going to lie down to sleep I was stopt for a Thief, indeed there was some Bacon there but I did not meddle with it. Being ask'd if he had any Friend to speak to his Character, he answer'd, That he had neither Father nor Mother, Sister or Brother, nor any Friend else but his own dear Person. Burnham was found 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.
             but Marsh was 

               acquitted

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner came to my House and call'd for a Mug of Beer, desired me to cast my Eye and see that the Hertford Wagon did not pass by. I went out, but could not see it; then I went out a second Time, and brought him Word it was coming, and the Prisoner came out and stopt the Wagon, order'd the Ropes to be unty'd, and several Boxes to be taken out, and carry'd into my House, then agreed with me for a Cart and Horse to carry the said Goods to the Blue Boar in Whitechappel, but refused to go by Bishopsgate Street, so I went up Brick Lane. When we came to the Inn, the Prisoner took the 4 Boxes down, which he said contained hard Ware and Plate.
Another Evidence depos'd. I keep a Victualling-house, the Royal-Oak at Rotherhith, and on the fourth or fifth of November the Prisoner and a Waterman came together to my House, and brought the Goods with them, and the Prisoner wanted to know how soon he could have an Opportunity to send them to Holland. The next Morning about 7 or 8 o'Clock the Waterman came again and they staid at my House till after Dinner, and then took the Goods away, and went through-bridge with them, where he discharg'd that Waterman, because he might not know where he lodg'd the Goods, and got another Waterman to carry them to Sevenstep Alley, where he had taken a Room for that Purpose: But soon after seeing an Advertisement in one of the News-Papers to apprehend the Prisoner, who had told me his Name, I went and found out the Waterman which he last employ'd, got a Constable and went to the House where the Prisoner was, and secured both him and the Goods.
The Prisoner made a poor trifling Defence. The Jury found him 

               guilty
             of all the Indictments.

The Prisoner thus made her Defence. The Prosecutor is Hostler
 at the White Horse Inn at Cripplegate, he came several Times to my Habitation, and desired me to go with him. - I must own I have been guilty of Folly in going into Gentlemens Company, and the Prosecutor has fetch'd me three Times of a Night, and whatever I got he had Part of it. Nay, I never got Half a Crown of a Gentleman, but he had a Shilling of it; and that very Night he charges me with this Fact, he told me I should lie with him, lock'd the Door, and put out the Candle.

               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

             thus depos'd, On the 16th Day of October, the Prisoner came to St. James's Chapel, and when Service was over, the Prisoner ask'd me if I did not know one Mr. Lloyd, I told him I did, for he was my Brother, he said he lov'd me for my Brother and Mother's Sake, and ask'd me to go to the Tavern with him, and then ask'd me to kiss him; at the End of the Mall he put his Hand into my Breeches, and forced my Hand into his, and when we came against Baron Bothmor's Wall



, he struggled with me till I was quite tir'd, but while he was letting down his Breeches I run away - On St. Luke's Day the Prisoner came to the Chapel, and spoke to me again, and carried me to an Ale-house in great Bond-street, and ask'd if the Man of the House was within, they answer'd no; from thence he went into St. James's street again, and carried me into a passage, kiss'd me, and held me against the Wall; at last I got away, then the Prisoner said, Mr. Lloyd you are deadly cross, you won't do as I would have you. Then he had me to the King's Head in Pall Mall, and call'd for half a Pint of Mountain, then pull'd his Chair close to mine, and put his Hand into my Breeches, and would have had me put mine into his.
Dr. Croft deposed; I am Master of the Children of his Majesty's Chapel, and 
               
                  Henry 
                  Lloyd 
               



             told me what had happened, I enquired after the Prisoner, and gave Orders, that if he came again, the Boy should have Liberty to go along with him to an Ale-house, that we might apprehend him, left such a Person coming amongst the Children might have an ill effect.


                  Silvanus 
                  Lloyd 
               



             deposed to this Effect, that the Boy having Liberty to go with the Prisoner, he followed them at some Distance through St. James's street into a Passage, where he saw the Prisoner rude with 
               
                  Henry 
                  Lloyd 
               



            , from thence he followed them to the Unicorne, and took a Chairman with him for fear there should be a Club of them; then asked the Man of the House what Gentleman that was that was along with one of the King's Schollars? he laughed, and asked me, Is he a Molley? I went up Stairs, asked 
               
                  Henry 
                  Lloyd 
               



             what Acquaintance he had with that Gentleman, he told me he offered to Treat him with a Supper - I seized the Prisoner, who, as we was going down Stairs had like to have made his Escape, but that being prevented, he down of his Knees, and said, he hoped we would not prosecute him, offering to Treat us, or to give us all the Money in his Pocket, but that not availing, he said we could not hang him, he not having committed the Fact.
The Prisoner made but a poor Defence, by saying that he only offered to give him half a Pint of Wine, that his Mother lived in Ireland, and he had not been long from thence. The Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

William Martin, Sen. thus depos'd. The Prisoner used to Wash one Day in a Week at my House, and to Iron another Day, so she was with me two Days in a Week constantly; I am a Victualler
, and on the Tuesday before Christmas Day I started some Beer, and going to over-haul my Books, I found my Money short for Payment of my Brewer, and that it did not answer the Draught I made of Liquor; which made me suspect some Body had Recourse to my Money besides myself. The Prisoner came to help Wash as usual, and immediately, was for going up Stairs; whereupon my Wife bid her keep to the Washing-Tub: In a little Time the Prisoner attempts to go up Stairs again, and my Wife desired to know what Business she had up Stairs? She said, to see for some foul Linen; my Wife told her the Maid could fetch that down, and bid her keep to washing: But the Prisoner's making such Excuses to go up Stairs, made my Wife suspect that she must be the Person that came at my Money, upon that I goes up Stairs, unlocks my Draw where I kept my Money, and counts it over very carefully, and put Twenty three Guineas in one Bag, and laid that at the Bottom of the Drawer, and put the Moidores, some half Broads and a new French Pistole in another Bag, and lays that near the Top of the Drawer, then came down, and my Wife sends the Prisoner up Stairs with a Petticoat that was below; the Prisoner carried it up and comes down again presently, upon which I goes up Stairs again, and found my Drawer lockt as usual, I unlockt it, and took out the Bag which had the odd Gold in it, and mist the new Pistole, then I took the other Bag and told over the Guineas, which I found exactly right: I acquainted my Wife and my Son how it was, and then order'd the Prisoner to go up Stairs and brush her young Master's Cloths; my Son taxed her with the Theft, the Prisoner denied it, and offered to be search'd, but first put her Hand in her Pocket and took out the Pistole, and endeavoured to conceal it in her Hand, but my Son perceiving it, he took hold of her Hand, her little Finger being closed, and found the Pistole under it; then the Prisoner said she found it in the Room, but I being in a Passion, told her she was a lying B - h, and that she took it out of my Drawer.
Mr. Martin, Jun, depos'd, That his Father told him he was robb'd, and sent the Prisoner up to brush his Cloths, as she frequently did before he went out, but when the Prisoner came up Stairs and saw him in his Gown, she desired to know what he wanted; whereupon he taxed her with robbing his Father, the Prisoner denied it, and offer'd to be searched, but at the same Time trembled, and was in great Confusion, and that upon searching her he found the Pistole upon her, as set forth in the former Deposition: The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

            , of Chiswick


, in the County of Middlesex, was indicted for 


               privately stealing a Gold Snuff-Box, (in which was set a curious Blood Stone) to the Value of 15 l.
             on the 2d of this Instant
, the Property of 
               
Madam
 Lutridge


            .
The Prosecutor depos'd, That she missing the Box, order'd a strict Search to be made after it, and at length heard it was offer'd to be pawn'd to one Mr Granger, who stopt the Box and secur'd the Prisoner.


                  Thomas 
                  Granger 
               



             depos'd, That one 
               
                  Katharine 
                  Chainey 
               



             brought the Box to him and offer'd it to pawn, but he not believing it was her own, demanded to know how she came by it, and not satisfied with her Answer, told her, he would stop it till he found the right Owner. (This destroys the Notion of some People, that it is impossible for a Pawnbroker to be honest.)


                  Katharine 
                  Chainey 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner brought the Box to her, and said a young Gentlewoman had occasion for a Guinea and a Half to pay her Lodgings, and desired her to borrow the Money on that Snuff-Box, and this Deponent not suspecting the Prisoner to have stole it, went and offer'd it to Mr. Granger as aforesaid; and upon her coming back and telling how it was stopt, the Prisoner said at first she would sooner lose it than go for it; afterwards she rose in a Passion, and said she would fetch it with a Ceceraro; upon which she went to Mr. Granger's with this Deponent, and telling a Story contrary to what she had told before, this Deponent very honestly detected her. After Madam Lutridge came and owned the Box, the Prisoner confest the Fact, and begg'd she might not be sent to Newgate; upon her Trial, she said, she found the Box in the Coach-House: But it appearing by the Evidence of 
               
                  John 
                  Price 
               



             and others, that by the Orders of Madam Lutridge, they had searched the Coach house, the Prisoner (who was a Servant
 in the House) searching with them; this Excuse was look'd upon as frivolous. She called several to her Character, which the Court indulged so far, as to give them a Hearing: But the Fact appearing plain, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d

The Prosecutor thus depos'd, On the 21st of December last about two or three in the Morning, as I was coming towards Stock's Market



 with Greens, I being a Gardener
, two Persons came up to me, and the tallest (which appear'd to be Rowell) put a Pistol to my Breast, and said G - d D - n you Deliver, saying, he would shoot me through the Body if I refused; upon this, he dragg'd me down a Lane, and beat me in a barbarous Manner, the shortest (which is Spurgins) did not strike me, nor use me ill, though the other took off my Cloaths, and then bound my Feet with a Cord and left me in the Snow; the shortest would fain have loos'd me, but the other would not suffer it; after some Time they went away together, and the shortest coming back, said, if he went to Newgate for it, he would have Compassion on me, and accordingly wiped the Blood from my Mouth, which flow'd in abundance from the Blows that the other had given me; after this, he bound my Head with his own Handkerchief, and cried over me, saying, this was his first Fact, and if he led this Course of Life he should be hang'd and if he left it he should be kill'd: After this, I heard of the Prisoner's being taken, and it being told me that one of them had my Shoes on, I went to Newgate and charg'd it on Spurgins, who confess'd it, saying, that she and Ned (meaning Rowell) were guilty, but as he had Compassion on me, he begg'd I would have the same for him.


                  Thomas

               Guilty

            . But 

               acquitted
             Rowell, by Reason the Prosecuter could not swear to his Person.
However, they intimated to the Court, that though they were obliged to bring in this Verdict in consequence of his Confession, yet they hoped he would be represented as an Object of Mercy.
This Rowell 


               pleaded guilty
             to an Indictment laid against him and Spurgins for 


               stealing Pidgeons

He further said, that he knew the House to have a very ill Name, which render'd him more inexcusable, that could on a Sabbath-Day at Night get Drunk, and fall into such a Place and Company, where, in all Probability, it was impossible for him to escape without falling under some unhappy Dilemma, or committing some Extravagance. The Prisoner said in her Defence, that she knew nothing of taking his Money, otherwise than as he gave her the Change when he paid his Reckoning, and offer'd her more if she would let him, &c. But as his vicious Inclinations would not excuse her Actions, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

The Prosecutor (a plain Country Man) depos'd, That he and another mistaking their Way, asked at the Gate of New-Prison, if there was not a Thoroughfare, for they wanted to go to Islington; upon which, the Man at the Door let him in, and immediately a Woman seiz'd his Hat, and two Men, the Prisoners at the Bar, shov'd him into a Dungeon, where they unbutton'd his Breeches, tore down his Waistcoat, and took away his Money mentioned in the Indictment.
Mr. Caddie depos'd, That he saw the Prisoners take hold of the Prosecutor and dragg'd him along, saying they would shew him the back Way to Islington, that they carried him into a Place, where they had not been long, but they ran out, and that this Deponent complaining of the hard Usage of the Countrymen, Shaw, the Under Keeper laugh'd at it; but when this Deponent found that the Prosecutor was robb'd of his Money, he very generously stood by the innocent Countrymen and complained of them to the Head Keeper, who threatened the Prisoners, but could not get them to confess the Fact.

             depos'd, That he, with the Prosecutor, missing their Way, Shaw, the Turnkey, let them in at the Gate, and bade the Prisoners shew them the back Way to Islington; confirming likewise what the Prosecutor depos'd, and adding, that he had seen the Prosecutor a Day or two before pull out 4 or 5 Guineas, and that when he was let loose from those Villains, after they had robb'd him, he was so terrified and foam'd at the Mouth, so that this Deponent, though acquainted with him, scarce knew him. The Prisoners call'd 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Watson 
               



             in their Behalf, who strengthen'd the Evidence of the Prosecutor; they had little to say in their Behalf, but that Shaw the Under-keeper, bid them shew them the back Way to Islington, and they hurried him away, but did not rob him: But the Fact appearing plain, the Jury found them 

               guilty
             of Felony.

Mr. Vaughan depos'd, That the Prisoner came with the Glass to his House, and offered it to Sale, but he suspecting it to be stole, thought convenient to have him taken into Custody till he could clear himself, and find out the Owner. Arra Dear Joy, said the Prisoner, will you be hanging me, or transporting me; but indeed you look like a very honest Man, and if you will be excepting on it yourself, you shall be very welcome, and then, dear Joy, I shall have no more Trouble about the Matter; but Mr. Vaughan having too great a Regard to Justice, to stifle the Matter for the Advantage of the Glass, detected dear Joy in his Villany. He said in his Defence, that he was buying it of a very honest Man, and indeed he gave 12 Shillings for it, and no more; but the Man he bought it of was a Stranger to him, for he never saw him before, yet and indeed he had a very honest Face. The Jury found him

 last. And 
               
                  
                     John 
                     Jackson 
                  



                
             was indicted for 


               receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen
            .
Mrs. Yarro depos'd, That on the 25th of March, the Prisoner being her Servant
, went up Stairs to this Deponent's Chamber, and she stopping there, this Deponent went up to see why she stopp'd at her Chamber, but as she was going up, the Prisoner went up Stairs into the Garret; yet tho she thought this a little odd, and forasmuch as she had not given her any Orders to go into her Chamber, yet she did not mistrust in the least that she had taken away the Money, yet by what she heard afterwards, it was her Opinion that the Money was taken away by the Prisoner at that Time; for soon after missing the Money, and expressing her Dissatisfaction at the Loss, a Neighbour informed her, that some Familiarities had pass'd in his Sight between the Prisoner 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Jones 
               



            , and the Prisoner 
               
                  John 
                  Jackson 
               



            ; upon which they sifted narrowly into the Matter, and having but too much Reason to believe it true, they carried her before a Magistrate who, after examining her, committed her to the Round-House, where she confess'd the Morning after her Commitment, that she had taken the Money out of the House, and said, That she had given it to John Jackson, which concurring with what she was told of by her Neighbour, they likewise thought fit to prosecute him for being Accessory to the Felony.
Mr. Clark depos'd, That on the 25th of March last, as he was looking out of his Window, he saw the Prisoner Sarah Jones, come out of her Master's House, and at some Distance stood John Jackson, to whom she went up, and after some Confabulation she gave him something into his Hand, with which he seem'd pleas'd, and chuck'd her under the Chin, but he said he could not perceive what it was that she gave him, yet he believing there was an Intrigue between them, went and informed her Master of it. He further said, That when 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Jones 
               



             was committed to the Round-House, he heard her confess her taking the Money, and at the same Time she said she gave it to John Jackson, when he this Deponent said, he saw them together from his Window.
Sarah Jones being ask'd what she had to say in her Defence, said, it was true, she took the Money out of her Master's House, and gave it to John Jackson.
John Jackson being ask'd what he had to say in his Defence, said, That he and Sarah Jones having at that Time a Respect for each other, he had a Design to marry her, and gave her a Ring at the Time which Mr. Clark said he saw her give something into his Hands.
Several Gentlemen appear'd for the Character of John Jackson, saying, he was an honest industrious Person, that maintained himself with a great deal of Credit and Reputation, and others depos'd in his Behalf, that Mr. Yarro the Prosecutor had said in their Hearing, That he would hang him right or wrong if he could; this being considered with the good Character he bore, and no positive Evidence appearing against him (for what Sarah Jones said was not Evidence) the Jury 

               acquitted
             him, but though the Information Sarah Jones gave against Jackson, was of no Effect, yet in Consequence of her own Confession at the Round-House, and at the Bar, she was found 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoner pick'd him up and persuaded him to go home to her Lodgings, where he gave her Half a Crown to fetch Salmon for Supper, and then they drank two full Pots of Beer and a Dram, after which they laid down upon the Bed, &c. and presently he felt her take his Money, and charging her with it, she said she would give it him again, but did not, for when she came with him to the Door she laugh'd at him; that he went away, but did not miss his Silver lace, which he had laid upon the Dresser which stood by the Bed-side, in a Bag, in which was as much as was worth 14 or 15 l. but she had only taken out four Pieces, value 5 l. which he supposed she took whilst he was asleep.

                  Elizabeth 
                  Smith 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner brought the Prosecutor to her Room, and sent her for the Salmon and for the Drink, and that when she came back the Prosecutor said, the Prisoner had got a Guinea and Half from him, and he would cut her Throat, at the same Time holding a Knife in his Hand, he struck at her and cut her Necklace, when the Prisoner said to him, My dear, dear Polliter, don't hurt me; after this he went away, and this Deponent went to Bed, and would have had the Prisoner come to Bed too, but she refused it, and upon this Deponent's asking her if she had got his Money, the Prisoner not only shew'd it her, but said, she had got something of him which was better still, and then shew'd her the Silver Lace; after which, she put it in this Deponent's Drawer, saying, she knew she was very welcome to it, but this Deponent seem'd to tell with some Concern, that when she 'wakd in the Morning the Prisoner was gone, and had taken both the Lace and Money with her. It appeared by other Witnesses, that the Prisoner was a wicked dissolute Creature, and had got Drunk with the Money, and sold some Part of the Lace to a Shoemaker.
The Prisoner had little to say in her Defence, but that she had it with the Prosecutor's Leave, they being too well acquainted for him to deny her any Thing, nor would he have prosecuted her, had not the Shoemaker stopp'd her and sent for the Prosecutor's Wife, and thereby discovered the Intriegue between them: But the Prosecutor's Folly would not excuse her Theft, for it evidently appeared that she had taken the Lace without his Knowledge and Consent; upon which the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d. for taking the Goods
            , but 

               acquitted her of the Charge of taking the Money
            , it being laid in a different Indictment.

Mr. Field depos'd, That on the 25th of June last, the Prisoner brought a Bundle to his House, and desired he would take Care of it, and upon their laying it on some Books in the Shop, she seem'd uneasy, and desired they would carry it up Stairs; that not long after, a little Boy, her Brother, came and desired he might stay till his Sister came, which they agreed to, that he staid to Dinner, and said, that the Lady where his Sister lived had been robb'd, which gave them some Suspicion that the Goods which she brought might not be honestly come by, and in Consequence of that Suspicion they opened the Bundle, and finding a Gold Watch and a considerable Quantity of Plate, he went and informed the Lady of it; that the Lady Culpepper came to his House, after securing the Prisoner, and found that the Bundle which she brought to his House, contain'd in it the Goods which were stolen from her Ladyship's Lodgings.

The Prisoner call'd several Witnesses to appear for her good Character, but the Evidence against her being very plain, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

                           Boucer 
                        




.
The Prosecutor depos'd (by an Interpreter) That he having lost his Pocket-Book, was inquiring for it at a House where the Prisoner was, and that they giving him some Encouragement, he called for Punch to make them drink, that presently the Prisoner took an Opportunity to pick his Pocket, and he finding his Money gone, charg'd her with it, when she jump'd out of the Window; and being afterwards taken and carried to the Round-house, he offered her a Guineas to let him have his Seal again, which was likewise taken from him at the same Time as his Money was; this, he said, he did to trap her, that he might fix the Fact upon her by some Evidence and accordingly his Scheme had the desired Effect, for she produced the Seal, and tho' she afterwards denied receiving a Guinea on such Account, yet they found the Guineas upon her in her Hair. It further appeared, that one Harvey, whom one of the Witnesses was so hardy as to call the Bawd of the House, said, they would live well with the Money.
She said in her Defence, That the Prisoner wanted to lie with her, and she refusing him, he began to Curse and Swear at her, and to avoid his Insults she got out of the Window; but this Artifice had but little Effect, for it appear'd she could not speak his Language (French) nor could he speak English. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d
            .

; but this Deponent falling asleep behind the Bar, did not hear any more of their Proceedings that Night: He said he knew both the Prisoner and the Deceas'd, and could not perceive any Malice between them.

, on the 19th of October
 last. It appear'd, That the Prisoner came to the Prosecutor's Shop, under the Pretence of wanting some Edging but she not being a ready Money Customer, and they not knowing her, she could not expect Credit, yet willing to be a Dealer in her own Way, she artificially palm'd a Piece of Lace upon a Card, but conveying it into her Bosom, she was seen by a Lad next Door, who pursu'd, and took her with the Lace in her Bosom. She pretended in her Defence, That it dropp'd into her Bosom by Accident, and she was coming back with it, when she was apprehended: but as one Part of her Defence was impossible, the Card lying on the Counter, so the other was very improbable, she being hurrying on a contrary Way from the Shop, out of which she took it, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

The Prosecutor depos'd, that on the 21st of November, when he went to Bed at Night, as his Custom was, he carried the Key of the Street Door up Stairs with him, but left the Key of the Back Door with his Servants, that the next Morning he was inform'd by his Maid, that his Street Door was broke open, and a paine of Glass taken out of the Window, that he went in surpris'd to see if any Thing was missing, and found the Goods mention'd in the Indictment taken away, upon which he went to Goldsmiths-hall, and caus'd his Plate to be advertis'd by Description, and the Advertisements distributed to the several Silver-Smiths and Pawn-brokers about Town, by which Method he came to hear of the Prisoner, who was stopp'd disposing of some of his Plate, but he would not confess the Robbery, saying he had the Goods of one Cockeril to dispose of; the Prosecutor then ask'd him who he knew, and how he might be satisfied with his Character, he said he was well acquainted with one Mr. Coxiter, and directed the Prosecutor where he lived, to whom the Prosecutor went and enquir'd out the Habitation of the Prisoner, and going there with a Search Warrant, he found several of his Goods which were taken out of his House, and on the Sunday Evening following, a Woman who said she was the Prisoner's Wife came, and Kneeling upon her Knees, deliver'd the Prosecutor almost all his Plate.
The Servants of the Prosecutor depos'd severally, That the Doors were all fast when they went to Bed on the 21st of November; and the Maid-Servant depos'd, That in the Morning when she came down Stairs, a Paine of Glass was taken out of the Window, and the Door was open.

The Prosecutor further depos'd, That when the Prisoner was first apprehended, he said, he had Acquaintance with one Nash, who he believ'd broke open the House, the said Nash being very familiar with one who had been the Prosecutor's Maid, and upon this Information the Prosecutor took a Warrant out for Nash, and his Maid, but he did not indict them. However, it was the Opinion of the Jury, that the Prisoner did not break open the House in the Night-Time, as mention'd in the Indictment, they therefore only found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

            's House, and that then Hamnet confess'd he bought it for three Half-pence a Pound.
Ayres said in his Defence, That Hamnet persuaded him to sell this Paper; that he first carried waste Paper, call'd Copy, but he refus'd to buy that, but when he carried the Paper mention'd in the Indictment, he bought it, and encourag'd him to bring more; but Ayres being a Prisoner, and Indicted, what he said was no Evidence against Hamnet; and Hamnet bringing several Tradesmen into Court, who severally depos'd, That they bought Paper good and clean for three Half-pence a pound, and some saying, they had bought this very Historical Register in Quires for that Price, and others appearing for his Character, the Jury 

               acquitted

, when the Prisoner being in Company, intie'd him and his Brother out of the House, and then said, he would be the Death of them if they would not go with him to the Lady Windham's, D - n their Bodies he would kill them: upon which this Deponent said, the Prisoner, himself and his Brother, went to the Lady Windham's, where the Prisoner hoisted his Brother over the Wall, and his Brother flung over 3 Fowls, but the Prisoner not being satisfied with them, got upon the Wall, and taking up a Brick, said, D - n his Body he would kill him if he did not fling them all over; that his Brother then flung over about 10 or 11 more, and the Prisoner pulling off his Coat, wrapp'd them all up in it, and carried them to his Son's House, where he, this Deponent and his Brother, were at the eating of some of them.

To which the Prisoner answered, for Fowls, that he flung over three, and then the Prisoner said, D - n his Body, he would kill him if he did not fling over all, at the same Time standing upon the Wall and holding a Brick in his Hand, till he had flung over all the Fowls.

               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

Esq
; the 4th of August
 last. Col.
 Bell, Comptroller of the Post-Office
 depos'd, that the Postmaster-General having had several Complaints made to him concerning Money, Rings, &c. being inclos'd and sent in Letters, having been lost, he was order'd, if possible, to find out the Persons who were guilty of such Practices, and thereupon laid the following Scheme in order to come at a full Discovery, viz. He order'd Mr. Sawtell one of the Officers, to write a Letter directed to Mr. Williams on Board the Ship Cornwall, to be left at the Posthouse, Portsmouth, bidding him write it in as ordinary a Hand as he could; this being done, he put into it a Guinea and 2 s. wrapp'd up in a Piece of Paper, and seal'd the Letter with a Thimble, and then order'd Mr. Dickenson to put it into a Box among other Letters which the Prisoner was to stamp and face that Night: Then he gave Dickerson Orders how to behave in order to detect him. 
               
                  John 
                  Sawted 
               



             depos'd, that he did write the Letter according to Col. Bell's Direction, and saw the Money put in, and the Letter seal'd; and that the Letter then produc'd in Court was the same he had writ. 
               
                  Richard 
                  Dickerson 
               



             depos'd, that he gave the Letter to Mr. Archer, and saw him put it into the Box; and that his Eyes were never off the Box 'till the Prisoner took the Letters out to stamp and face, which being done, the Prisoner went out of the Office; upon which he and Mr. Archer look'd over the Letters, and miss'd that Letter aforesaid; then he went into the Yard, and found the Prisoner, and charg'd him with a Letter that was missing, which he deny'd; but searching him, the Letter and Money was found in a little Pocket between his great Pocket and the outside of his Wastecoat. Mr. Archer depos'd, that Mr. Dickerson being Officer of the Night, gave him the Letter, and he put it into the Box; and that the Prisoner being sent out to get some Pipes, he went and look'd over the Letters, and that Letter was missing; that they went after him, and charg'd him with it, but he deny'd it; that Mr. W. came, and they went into the Comptroller's Room; that there the Prisoner pull'd out his Pockets, but no Letter could be found; but feeling about his Pockets, he felt a Lump, but could not find the Way into it, but said they must cut it out; at last they found a little Opening, but so narrow, that the Letter was doubled up to get it in, Mr. W. depos'd, that on the 4th of August he went into the Inland Office, and Mr. Archer said to Mr. Dickerson, It is not here; that thereupon Dickerson said, the Prisoner had stolen a Letter; that they challang'd him with it, but he deny'd it; that carrying him into the Comptroller's Room, he being search'd, the Letter was found in a Little Pocket between the Pocket and the outward Part of his Wastcoat. The Prisoner in his Defence deny'd the Fact, and that he knew any thing of the Letter being in his Pocket; and as to the private Pocket, he said he had borrow'd the Wastcoat that Morning to wear: His Plea being incredible, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

 last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That his House was broken, and the Watch stolen; but he did not suspect the Prisoner, who was his Journeyman
, and had been his Apprentice; 'till a Goldsmith, who was his Neighbour, and having bought his Gold Seal, and hearing he had been robb'd, gave him Notice of it; and that it was brought to him by a Boy belonging to an Alehouse, at the Three Kings in the Minories; that being inform'd by the Boy that the Prisoner had sent him, he search'd the Prisoner's Lodging, but could not find the Watch; and that the Prisoner being examin'd, pretended he found the Seal in a Field going to Limehouse.
The Boy depos'd, He receiv'd the Seal from the Prisoner, who sent him while he was drinking in his Master's House, in his Master's Name, to sell it; and that he did, and he gave the Money to the Prisoner.

However, the Prisoner at the Bar deny'd the Fact, and insisted upon it that he found them, and call'd several Witnesses to prove he was elsewhere all that Night, and so could not possibly commit the Fact; which tho' they came pretty near, did not amount to a satisfactory Proof: He also call'd several Persons to his Character, who gave him a good one; as also did his Master himself, the Prosecutor: But the Fact being so clearly prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

JOHN PECHE. I am a clerk in the Ordnance Office

            . I am in the same office with Mr. Peche. I was in Red Lion-square, and saw Bennett take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket and give it to Laird - They both ran away. I never lost sight of them. A cry was raised and they separated. I took Bennett. Laird was taken immediately. I am sure they are the persons.

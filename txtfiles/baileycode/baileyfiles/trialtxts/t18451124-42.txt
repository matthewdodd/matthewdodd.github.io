EDWARD BURGESS
 (police-constable H 198.) On Thursday evening, the 13th of Nov. about half-past eight o'clock, I was on duty in the Whitechapel-road—I saw a horse and cart drive up to the King's Arms publkshoase, witk two parties in it who I knew to be the associates of thieves—one of them, named Myers, I had in custody about two years ago—I did not know the other man's name, but I knew his person—in consequence of seeing this cart I called Bray, a brother constable, and told him to take charge of the horse and cart, while I went into the public-house—the two persons dismounted from the cart and went into the public-house—I was about four or five yards from the

cart at that time—I saw in the cart a truss of hay, a bundle of straw, and a sack containing something, I do not know what—a person they call Ratty came out of the public-house—I knew him to be the associate of thieves—he took hold of the horse by the head—I then went into the public-house, and saw a great number of persons there, from fourteen to twenty, but I did not see the two that had been in the cart—I knew a great number of them by sight, in fact I knew them all, though not by name, but they are all always in company with thieves, a regular gang of them—I then came out of the house and said, "Bray, we must take this horse and cart to the station"—I then took hold of the horse, and Bray also—Bray was standing at the horse's head at the time I came out—he had a view of the contents of the cart—when we took hold of the horse's head from fourteen to twenty persons rushed out of the public-house, and surrounded us—they called out "Don't let the b----s take it"—Myers, and the other man whose name I do not know, but whom I had seen at first, got into the cart—I saw him come out of the house—Myers drove it away—Carney made an attempt to get up, he got on the step but came down again—several of them said, "Whip their b----hands off; cut their be hands off"—I saw all the three prisoners—Barnett said tome," Mr. Burgess, let the horse and cart go, it belongs to him," pointing to Myers, who was in the cart—I knew Barnett before—I said, "I shan't let the horse and cart go, it roust go to the station"—several of them cried out, Don't let it go, don't let them take it"—Carney said, "Won't you let it go T—at the time I saw Lewis close by Carney, at the side of the cart—I was standing close by the horse's head—I had hold of it—Lewis struck me twice or three times in the breast with his fist, not very severely, it did not hurt me much—I continued hold of the horse, and shortly after Carney gave me a blow across the face with a pen-knife—it cut part of my nose off and left it hanging down—I could see the blade of the knife—he gave me a second blow on the left temple, and cut me severely—it bled very much—he also gave me a slight cut in the neck, but not much—I think that was from another blow—I cannot say whether received three blows—I found this slight cut in the neck when I got to the hospital—I was taken away by two men to a doctor's shop and got the wounds dressed—I should say Lewis was standing by me for about ten minutes or better—he was close by Carney at the time I was taken away—I should say he was there at the time the cuts were given, I saw him—he had on a brown coat—the second cut was immediately after the first—as soon as he struck the first, he came back and gave me the second—it was done all in a second—I have known Barnett about three or four years—I have seen him frequently during that period—I think to the best of my knowledge he had on a brown Taglioni coat on this occasion—I have been well acquainted with him, and seen him very often—I have known Carney about twelve months—I have seen him frequently, and have frequently seen him in the King's Arms—I have known Lewis I should say better than twelve months—I have seen him frequently up and down Whitechapel—I have not the least doubt of the persons at any of the prisoners—I was ten days in the hospital, and am an out-patient at present.

Carney. Q. Where abouts did you meet the horse and cart? A. At the King's Arms—I saw it drive up to the door—I cannot say that I saw you come out of the house—I went and took hold of the horse's head, and then I saw you—I am quite sure you had a knife in your hand—I saw the blade—I did not see the handle—it was a large-sized penknife—I did not see you draw it—you were standing close by me, you and Lewis—I was holding the horse with my right hand when I was struck—I was struck before I was stabbed—I turned round to sec the person that struck me—it was not then

I was stabbed—it was when I turned round again—I am sure you are the person that stabbed me—I became insensible after two stabs, and two men took me to the doctor's—they are not here—I suppose there were from 400 to 500 persons round at the time—the street was filled with people—I called for assistance, but no one came to assist me—there were too many of your party there, and the people were frightened to come—I do not suppose any respectable shopkeeper would venture to come forward, there was such a desperate lot—I drew my staff—I had no opportunity of using it, you took good care of that—I bad it out nearly all the time—I struck no one with it, I could not get an opportunity, you prevented me—I was some time at the horse's else that I know of—I suppose I was from twenty minutes to half an hour at the horse's head—I did not remain a moment after. I was stabbed—it was not you alone that assaulted us, it was all your gang; you had got, I suppose, about twenty to assist you, while we only had our two selves—I saw you in conversation with the others inside the house, not outside.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. When the persons said, "Whip their b----hands off," they also said, "Whip the horse," did not they? A. Yes—I am quite sure Barnett was there—he spoke to ice—I cannot say he was there when I was cut—he was on the kerb-stone when he spoke to me.

COURT. Q. Was Lewis there when you were cut? A. He was, close to Carney.

Lewis. Q. When you came into the public-house, what part was I in? A. I did not take notice; I did not delay a moment inside; you might hare been in the parlour—I had my staff drawn when you struck me—I could, not get an opportunity to strike you, or to use my staff, because you all pressed too tightly on me.





JOSEPH BRAY
 (police-constable H 43.) I was called by Burgess, in front of the King's Arms, White-chapel-road, about half-past eight o'clock on the night in question—I saw a horse and cart at the door—there was no one in it when I came up—Carney was standing by it—Burgess went into the house—he might be gone a minute and a half, or two minutes, before he came back—I saw on the top of the cart some hay, a bundle of straw, and a sack full of something, but the bed of the cart was full underneath the straw—I knew Carney before—when Burgess came out he said, "Bray, we must take this horse and cart round to Spital fields station"—Burgess and I took hold of the horse for the purpose of doing so—we were in the act of turning the horse's head round, when Carney seized horse of it—we had not succeeded in turning it round—about fifteen or twenty persons came out of the King's Arms at the time—that was while Carney had hold of the horse—we all three had hold of it—among those who came out I noticed Lewis, and several more not yet in custody—I did not see Barnett at that time—there were cries of" Cut their b----hands off don't let them take it"—that was repeated more than once or twice—I cannot say whether any expressions of that kind were used by either of the prisoners—whilst I, Carney, and Burgess were at the horse's head, I saw Lewis come off the pavement—he was the second that took hold of Burgess and me, and likewise of the horse's head—he struck me two or three tires—I had then hold of the horse's head at the off side—I saw him strike Burgess in the breast more than two or three times—Burgess at that time had hold of the horse's head at the near side—I heard some one say to Burgess, "Let go the horse; it belongs to the person in the cart;" but who said that I cannot say—I did not notice Burgess cut by anybody—after Lewis struck me I still kept hold of the horse's head—I was on the opposite side to Burgess, but

at times we were both in front by being pushed about so—Carney was on the near side, the same side as Burgess—I did not notice Burgess after he was cut—while I was standing at the horse's head I was struck a severe blow from behind, between the shoulders, like from a stick or some heavy instrument, and directly after that I missed Burgess from the horse's head—about a minute or two before I missed Burgess I saw Carney take a knife from his right hand side, and open it with his left hand—about a minute or two after receiving the blow between the shoulders, Barnett came from behind the cart, and struck me in the left ear—I was not aware when at the police-court that my hat was cut as it is—had it not been for my hat I should have received a more severe blow—my hat is cut right round—it was done with a stick or a life-preserver, I cannot say which; but I saw Barnett come from the tail-part of the cart with something in his hand a foot or eighteen inches long, and be struck me with that—I have known him about three years—I am positive he is the man that struck me that blow—I have not the least doubt of it—it disabled me from holding the hone—I was knocked right away from the horse—it cut me very dangerously—I was carried to the doctor's, from the doctor's to the station, and from there to die hospital, where I remained nine days—my ear was cut from the blow—it was sewn up when I got to the hospital—two of the persons that came up, got into the cart, and succeeded in driving it off—I was in my uniform, on duty—Burgess had his private coat on—he is in the habit of being out in plain clothes, but they all knew him—I had my staff out part of the time—I took it out when I received the blow between the shoulders—Burgess had his staff hanging on his arm, and I saw Carney lay hold of it and try to get it from him—I have been into this public-house several times—I was never in the back place, never further than the bar—about half-past ten that night I was fetched from where I reside, to go down to the station to charge Barnett, who had been taken into custody by a sergeant—I saw him at the station in custody—my ear had not been sewn up then—I was taken to the hospital afterwards—some lotions had been applied to it, to stop the bleeding.

Carney. Q. Whereabouts were you when you saw me draw the knife? A. I had hold of the horse on the off-side, standing rather before the horse—I was holding the rein with my left hand—I was at the horse's head, but I could see round to Burgess's side—you were not behind him, but on his right side—Burgess was between you and me—I could see you take out the knife, and open it—the horse and cart had been moved into the middle of the road then—it was not very dark—the lamps from the turnpike showed a light—the cart might be half-a-dozen or a dozen yards from the turnpike then—I distinctly saw you take the knife from your right side, and open it with your left hand—I did not see you use it—I did not see Burgess stabbed—I saw you strike him with your hand when you reached across to take hold of the horse's head—that was almost at the commencement of it—I missed Burgess it might be a minute and a-half, or two minutes after I saw you draw the knife.

Cross-examined. Q. Where was the cart at the time you received the blow? A. It had then got into the middle of the road, perhaps ten or twelve yards from the King's Arms—when it commenced it was about two yards from the front of the King's Arms—Union-street is the first street past Whitechapel church—the King's Arms is on the left, and Union-street on the right—the King's Arms is about twenty or thirty yards further down the road—I had hold of the horse's head with my left hand at the time I received the blow behind—I was looking towards the horse and cart, not leading the horse along—we were stopped with it—I did not see who struck me the blow behind—that was the first blow I received—it was Barnett that struck me

between the shoulders, that could not have been with the fitt—in addition to that blow, I received the cut in the ear—that was from Barnett—I did to hear him deny having struck me that blow—I did not hear him say anything at the station—I was merely brought there to identify him, and then taken away.

Lewis. Q. Did I have hold of the horse's head when I struck you? A. Yes, you did not let go of the horse's head to come round and strike me—you were rather at the near side of the horse's head, but when you first seized the horse you were in the middle of us—Burgess and me, you and Carney, all four had hold of the reins at the same time—you struck Burgess first, two or three times, and then me three or four times—I believe Burgess had his staff drawn—I had not mine drawn then.

COURT. Q. Were you and Burgess endeavouring to retain possession of the horse? A. Yes—instead of resisting by blows, our object was to keep the horse.

MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you notice anything particular about the person or dress of Barnett, that night? A. Yes, the coat he had on then was a brown coat, Sergeant Or am has it, and I noticed to guard-chain about his person—it came out of some part of his waistcoat to the pocket—it appealed like a gold chain—I had noticed him wearing that same chain for some time.





EDWARD ORAM
 (police-sergeant H 18.) In consequence of information received, I took Barnett into custody on the 13th of Nov., about ten o'clock in the evening, near the King's Arms, White-chapel-road—he had on a dark velveteen coat—he had this gold guard-chain round his neck, attached to a watch in the usual way—I said, "Barnett, I want you"—he said something which I did not distinctly hear—on his way to the station he turned his head towards me, and said, "It was you took hold of me, 18, I will make you suffer for this"—I told him he was in Custody for the assault on the constable—he said, "You need not tell me that I know what it is for; I can prove where I was at the time".

Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his house? A. No—I believe Inspector Done again went about the coat—I did not go with him—I have the coat.

MR. CLARK. Q. What coat is it? A. A brown coat—it was delivered up to me at the station this morning, as the one Done again brought from the house—I received it from the sergeant on duty at the station to which Baroett was taken, in the inspector's room.





GEORGE TREW
 (City police-constable. No. 26.) In consequence of instructions I received, I apprehended Carney on the evening of the 15th of Nov. at the corner of Liverpool-street, Bishops-gate-street—he was along with several others—I had only been looking for him that evening—I took him to the station, and told him he was charged with cutting and wounding a policeman named Burgess, up in White-chapel, on Thursday evening last—he said, "I can prove that I was not in London; I was in the country from Monday night last till Friday night, and on Thursday night 1 was thirty miles from London."

Carney. Q. Do you recollect what part of the country I told you I was in.? A. You did not name any part—you did not name Stoney Stratford, nor say from forty-nine to fifty miles—you said thirty miles as plain as you could speak—when I first took you I told you I wanted a gentleman to look at you, about a little spaniel dog—you said if that was the case you would go along with me—I searched you at the station, and found 103. 6rf. on you—I took you to Spitalfields station—I did not bring Conway, a policeman, to identify you—he was not present at the time of the assault—I asked you whether you would be locked up, or go to the London Hospital and see

Burgess—you said you would go to the hospital, and paid for a cab there—I did not step into the ward before you, and say, "You roust not walk into the room; you will disturb the patients"—you walked in along with me.

Carney. I asked you whether you would not disturb the patients as well as me; and you said you could walk much lighter in consequence of my having heavy boots and you light ones; you and Conway went up to Burgess's bedside; I was kept five or six yards away, and what passed between you I do not know, only you said, "Burgess, I have Carney in charge;" as much as to say, "I have got a person in charge whom you must swear to." Witness. It is false—before either of us spoke Burgess saw you, and jumped out of bed, saying, "You murdering villain," or hound," or something like that—I was behind you—I did not say I had you in custody—I never mentioned your name—I did not walk up to the bedside and say you would disturb the patients—I admit telling you I wanted a gentleman to look at you—I had a reason for doing so, for you were along with a gang of notorious thieves—I said that to get you out of their company, and I would not tell you the charge till I got you to the station.

MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you any communication with Burgess from the time this occurred till you took Carney into custody? A. No, I had never seen him—I took Carney into custody from a description given of him by others—Conway is a metropolitan constable—he was not in White-chapel on the night in question—we all three went to the hospital together for the purpose of seeing Burgess—I did not make the least insinuation or communication to Burgess before Carney was shown to him—as soon as he recognised him he jumped out of bed.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Were you once in the H division? A. Yes—I have known Barnett eight or nine years—I always found him a quiet, peaceable, humane man—I never heard anything in this way of him before.

MR. BODKIN. Q. In what way of life is he? A. I have been in the habit of seeing him standing about Petticoat-lane—I do not know how he got his living.

COURT. Q. What do you know about his humane disposition? A. have been in the habit of seeing him daily, and never heard of his being in any row or disturbance before.





DAVID HUDSON
 (City police-constable, No. 583.) I took Lewis into custody on Monday evening last, the 24th of Nov.—I saw him coming along, with a box of tea on his shoulders, in Fenchurch-street—I did not take him on this charge.





HENRY SHEARLEY SAUNDERS
. I am one of the dressers at the London hospital—on Thursday evening, the 13th of Nov., Burgess was brought there about half-past ten o'clock—the right wing of his nose was entirely divided, likewise the cartilage, and he had a small punctured wound on the left temple—he was in a very weak state from loss of blood—in a state of insensibility—I have no doubt the wounds were inflicted with a cutting instrument—it was a clean cut—he suffered evidently from loss of blood.

Carney. Q. Was he brought there by anybody? A. By a policeman—a pen-knife would cause such wounds—I have not the slightest doubt of that.

Carney's Defence. I am innocent of the offence I stand here accused of; had I been guilty I certainly should not have remained in London, or have walked through the public streets as 1 did; 1 know nothing of it, and was not in London at the time it took place.

Lewis's Defence. I hope you will take my case into consideration; I am an innocent man; does it stand to reason that if a little man like me was

between two officers they would allow me to strike them, when they had. their staves in their hands, without seizing me or making some defence in their own behalf? I was never in the mob; I never had hold of the horse's reins at all, and was not near them at the time it took place.

MR. PAYNE
called the following witnesses:





GEORGE ROSE
. I work for Mr. Ezekiel Baker, a gun-maker, in Whitechapel-road, and live at No. 16, Three Colt-street, Old Ford—I was in the crowd on the evening in question, the 13th of Nov. I think, when this matter happened—it was from half-past eight to nine o'clock—I saw the officers, Bray more particularly, who was at the head of the cart—I saw blows struck by persons who were at the head of the cart—I saw a man in a brown coat—he seemed to be the most active in the mob—I saw Bray directly after he was struck—I was close by him when he was struck—he stumbled over me, and another person caught him by the side of me—I know Barnett by seeing him in the King's Arms and about there, and I have spoken to him several times—I did not see who it was that struck Bray—I did not see Barnett there—can swear he was not close to Bray at the time—I did not see him—I did not see him at all that evening—the man in the brown coat was flourishing his an about, and was at the head of the horse—that man was not Barnett, I am certain—I do not know the name of that man—he seemed to me to have rather a thin face and light brown whiskers—I was not looking more particularly at him than any one else—he being the most active, attracted my attention—I cannot say that I saw either Carney or Lewis—I cannot say I did not

COURT. Q. You could not see either of the three prisoners where you stood? A. No, I could not—I have been in Mr. Baker's employ three years and a half or four years—I did not come out of the public-house—I was not in there—there was a man in the cart, with a jacket and cap on—I did not know him—that was the only person I saw in the cart.





MARK SPITTLE
. I live in Raven-street. I am a gun-maker, in the employ of Mr. Baker, in White-chapel—he has from forty to fifty men working for him—I have seen Burgess, and I know Barnett—I remember the cart being stopped by Burgess and Bray on the night in question—I saw Barnett that night, I should say from a quarter past eight o'clock till a quarter to ten, in the King's And in front of the bar—he had on a black velvet shooting jacket, with horn buttons—I left the King's Arms at a quarter to ten—he was there till that time—I do not say positively for every minute—he had not a brown coat on—Burgess came in while Barnett and I were at the bar, and went out again—Barnett followed by his side, or close to him, saying the horse and cart belonged to a I person of the name of Myers—I do not know who was in the cart—I never saw the cart—I heard Barnett say the horse and cart was all right, it belonged to Myers—that was as he was going out—Barnett was not outside the house two minutes at that time—I will swear that—my wife was inside, standing at the bar—she was saying to Barnett, "Why don't you look after a house for us?" when Burgess came in, shook hands with us, and went into the tap-room—Barnett followed him—he came out again, and my wife asked Burgess to drink—he said, "Business must be done first"—Barnett was then at the back of Burgess, and he said, "You may depend on it the horse and cart is all right, it belongs to Myers."

MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever keep the King's Arms? A. No—my wife did, prior to my marrying her—her name was Deval—she had left the house nearly a month before I married her—I do not remember any conversation taking place in the presence of the police-sergeant about this matter since it occurred—we had some conversation with Burgess last week in front of this court—my wife did not say to the sergeant or Burgess, in my presence, "He"

(meaning me,) "knows nothing about it, except what I told him"—I have seen Oram—my wife never said that in his presence—nothing of the sort ever happened—I went into the King's Arms about a quarter past eight o'clock—I was in front of the bar—I did not sit down—I was standing all the time—my wife sat down part of the time, I should expect in front of the bar—we had a glass or two of stout—there might be a score or more of persons sitting in front of the bar—I might know some few of them—Watts was there, and Clark, a shop mate of mine—I do not know what Watts is—I do not remember two men coming in out of a cart, neither did I know anything about the cart till Burgess came in, and Barnett was standing by the side of me and my wife in conversation, when Burgess came in—Burgess and Barnett were in conversation, and they went together through the passage into the tap-room—Barnett did not follow Burgess into the tap-room—he only went to the door and came back with Barnett, when Barnett said, "It is all right, the cart belongs to Myers"—both Burgess and Barnett were inside the house when that was said—the only time Barnett went outside was with the parties belonging to the cart going to the door after Burgess; and as soon as they were out Barnett was inside again, and I never missed him afterwards—he was only out to admit of the others going out, and then he was in again—all I heard him say was, that the cart belonged to Myers—I am sure he mentioned the name of Myers—his words were, "Mr. Burgess, the horse and cart is all right, it belongs to Myers"—at I that time Burgess had not got hold of the horse or the cart either—I live now at No. 32, Raven-street—I had seen Barnett many times before in the velveteen coat and horn buttons—I swear that he had it on that night—I never went outside the house till a quarter to ten o'clock, no more than going to the door when the thing was over, and a quantity of people were collected by White-chapel church, I mean, when I heard there had been this depredation committed on the police—I saw Carney that night in the King's Arms, after I the noise was over—I do not recollect seeing him before—I did not see him come into the King's Arms.

Q. On your oath, did not Carney, when He came into the public-house, say, "We have killed that by—Burgess V A, I did not hear him say it—I swear that—I and my wife were in the same part of the house—after Carney came in, she called me, and said, "Did you bear that?"—I said, "What?" and she said, "They have done for Burgess"—with that I went to the door, and looked round the street, and there was a crowd of 300 or 400 people, fifty or sixty yards from the King's Arms—the bar is from six to seven yards from the street-door—you go straight up to the bar—there is no passage—it faces you directly you go in.

MR. PAYNE. Q. How long have you worked for Mr. Baker? A. Two years within a few days—before that I worked for Mr. Field, a gun-maker, of Chambers-street, for three years, and that is as long as I have been in London—I did not hear Barnett say anything after he went outside—I should Bay he was not gone out long enough to have spoken to Burgess at the head of the cart—what I heard him say was inside—I do not know what he said when outside.

COURT. Q. You say he was only absent time enough to let the others pass? A. Yes, for as the last went out he came in—I did not say he was two minutes doing that—I cannot say the time—the men went out as fast as they could, and he came in as the last went out—I should say two minutes never elapsed from the time he went out.





ELIZA SPITTLE
. I am the wife of the last witness. I was with my husband at the King's Arms on the night this matter happened—I saw Barnett

there first about a quarter past eight o'clock—he had on a black velveteen coat—he was not dressed in a brown Taglioni—it was a common coat with pockets at the side—a Taglioni is made in a similar way—I remember Burgess coming in—he passed into the tap-room—Barnett followed him—Burgess came out, and Barnett also; but Barnett still remained with me—I said to Burgess, "Will you take anything to drink?—he said, "I are on other business"—he then went out—Barnett still remained with roe—I did not hear him say anything to Burgess as he went out—Barnett remained with me I should think an hour—he did not go out at all—I never missed his a—I cannot say whether he was out for a minute or so—I never misscd him—I remember somebody coming in and saying something about Burgess—Barnett was then standing with me.

MR. BODKIN. Q. Who was the person that came in? A. The prisoner Carney—he said, "We have killed that b—y Burgess"—my husband was standing close by me at that time, and Barnett also—I kept this house formerly for three years, as a widow—it is a house of very fair business—I hart known Barnett for some time, always as a very respectable man, and very quiet and inoffensive—he used to frequent my house—all the persona that frequented my house were not so—he was particularly so—my acquaintance with him continued down to this time—no further than using my house—was close to the bar—I was going into the parlour, but Barnett stopped me—the bar is a little way from the door—I never lost sight of him—I swear that I never lost sight of him from a quarter past eight till I should think nine or half-past—he was standing talking with me all that time, and was never nearer the door than that—I never lost sight of him—I have always I been equally sure of that—I never missed him at all.

Q. Have you not said that he might have gone out without your knowing it? A. Yes, he might—I was speaking to him, and never missed him—I do not suppose I missed him a minute—I did not miss him, but in tatting to other parties, he might have gone out—I do not believe he did go out—I am certain he did not go out.

MR. PAYNE. Q. You say you were talking to other persons—can you any it was impossible for Barnett to have gone to the door, said a word and cone back again? A. Well, 1 should think it was impossible—I do indeed.





WILLIAM WATTS
. I live in White-chapel—I am nothing at purse it—I hate just left a public-house at Norwich—I was at the King's Arms on the night this matter happened, from six till half-past nine—I saw Barnett there all the time—I do not recollect Burgess coming in—Barnett was dressed in a black velveteen coat.

COURT. Q. Did you remain in the public-house? A. Yes, all the time, till half-past nine—I saw Carney there, I did not hear him say anything—I was in the front bar when he came in—Mrs. Spittle was there—I only heard him call for a glass of wine—I did not hear him say a word about Burgess—I understood there was a row outside—I did not go out—I never stirred out of the door—I had known Barnett before—I have been from Norwich eight or nine months, and have been out of business that time, living in White-chapel—I have not been in any situation since I have been in London—I have been living on the money I sold my house at Norwich for.





JUDAH LYON
. I am a dealer in new and second-hand Brussels carpets, and live at 20, Fashion-street, Spitalfieids. I was in the White-chapel-road, passing the King's Arms, and saw a policeman having hold of the horse there were eight or nine persons on the pavement, but no one by the side of the policeman—the policeman was off the kerb—I saw Barnett standing by the door of the public-house, with his back against the door smoking his

pipe—that was from half-past eight till I should say nine—I saw no disturbance before the public-house door—the policemen went on, and Barnett went into the public-house—the policemen went on with the cart about ten or fifteen yards—three or four men took hold of the cart—a scuffle took place, and one of the policemen was knocked down—I did not see Barnett then—I was standing about three yards away from the place—Barnett was not there at that time—I have known him for a good many years—if he had been the person that knocked the policeman down I must have seen it—I have not spoken 'to him half-a-dozen words in my life—he was dressed respectably—he had on a darkish coat, as I recollect—I cannot exactly say what colour—(looking at the coat produced by Oram) it was not such a coat as this—it was darker than that—I could not very well mistake that for a black velveteen.

MR. BODKIN. Q. That would not look quite so light at night? A. This is not the coat he had on—I am sure of it—I swear that—I cannot tell what sort of coat the man had on that knocked the policeman down, or what he knocked him down with—a scuffle took place, and I saw the policeman go down with his hands up and his truncheon up—three or four men had their hands up, and then the cart went away—I cannot exactly say whether the policeman was knocked down by the blow of a fist—Barnett was not by I at the time—I cannot say what instrument it was—I did not see the face of the man that knocked him down, nor yet his coat—I saw his arm up—I saw several arms up—it was a regular common pipe that Barnett was smoking—he was standing with his back against the public-house door, interfering with no one and talking with no one—I did not see him hardly a minute—I did not say I had seen him at the door from half-past eight till nine—I hardly saw him a minute—I do not know what caused him to go in so suddenly—he went in with his pipe in his hand—I did not notice anybody come out—when the policemen went on with the cart I went on the pavement—the cart was going on while Barnett was standing there with his pipe—the officers had hold of the horse's head—I did not see Barnett say anything to the officers—I am quite sure he did not—I cannot tell whether any one did come out of the public-house—I saw Barnett go in—I saw no one come out—I was not there above two minutes altogether—when I saw a mob of people there, I stopped a minute—there might be twelve persons for what I know—I should say there were about fifty round the cart, not exactly at the time I saw the officer drop, because the horse pranced up a little, as if the man in the cart was pulling, and the people were scattered round about four or five yards away from the cart—the police had hold of the horse, and so had three or four other men I—I did not see the policeman with his nose cut—I saw Bray on the ground, with the back part of his neck bleeding—when the cart went away, I went home—I did not go into the public-house—I did not go and help to pick the man up—I sometimes keep a stock of carpet—I have a little now—about 1l. or 2l. worth of old—I deal with persons who come to my place, brokers, in Middlesex-street, White-chapel—persons bring in things, and come to me to go to their place to buy—Middlesex-street is not more than five minutes' walk from my place, and when they think they have anything to suit me, I go to their place—I live along with my brother-in-law, he rents the house—it goes in his name—I occupy the shop and parlour—Middlesex-street is the place called Petticoat-lane—I have known Barnett I should say twenty years—I cannot tell what his business is.

COURT. Q. Have you seen him in Middlesex-street? A. Not to my knowledge—I never spoke to him half-a-dozen words.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Were you going by the public-house, or had you been in it?


A. Going by—when I said this was from half-past eight till nine, I did not mean to say that Barnett stood at the door half an hour—he went in jett as the cart had got a little way off.

JURY
to
JOSEPH BRAY. Q. What view had you of Barnett at the time he struck you? A. I had hold of the horse with my left hand, and in the act of turning to the right to take hold of the near side, I saw Barnett come from behind the cart, the full-length of the horse and cart—I saw him come the whole length of the horse and cart toward me, and when he was about the middle of the cart I saw the stick, or life-preserver, in his hand—he rose it up—I was then in the act of being shoved round, when I received the blow on the ear—I cannot say whether it was a life-preserver or a stick.—it was about a foot or eighteen inches long—there are different sorts of life-preservers—some are loaded with lead, and have a cord round them and some catgut—some are dark, and some covered with leather—there was sufficient light for me to see Barnett—there are six or seven lamps at the turnpike, which was not ten yards off—I never entertained any doubt of Barnett being the man who struck me—as soon as I got to the station-house: I was asked who did it, and I directly described Barnett as being the man—I gave his name as well.

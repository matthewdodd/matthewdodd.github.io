, and live in George-street, near Hanover-square


; I employed the prisoner as a chair-woman
, and sometimes she worked in the shop
. I missed several things, and I set one to watch the rest of my servants, and he catched the prisoner with a looking-glass concealed between her legs; then I charged her with taking the other things, and she confessed taking the things mentioned.

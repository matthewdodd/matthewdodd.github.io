, December 20
.
It appear'd, That the Prosecutor (being a Country Man) met the Prisoners in Fleet-Street, and enquir'd for a Tavern, not distinguishing (as he said) who sold Liquors, and who sold other Goods, because every House here had a Sign, and in the Country there were no Signs but to Houses that sold Liquor; and the Prisoners offer'd to shew him a Tavern , and carried him to the King's Head, in King's-Head Court, in Shoe-Lane


 , and that he was no sooner got there, but the Prisoners husled about him, and took his Money; the Jury found them 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.
             each.

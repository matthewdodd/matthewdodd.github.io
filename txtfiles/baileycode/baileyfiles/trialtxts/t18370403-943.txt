JOHN EDMUNDS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of February, 2 pairs of shoes, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Maria Cohen, his mistress.






MARIA COHEN
. I live in Bishopagate-street, and am single. The pri-soner was in my employ about seventeen months—I lost these shoes on the 22nd of February—I had not sold them—one pair has my mark on them—the other has my sister's—I charged the prisoner with taking them—he begged for mercy, and acknowledged having taken them—I have lost 40l. worth.





JANE COHEN
. I am assistant to my sister—we lost a good deal of property—I watched, and saw one pair of shoes in the prisoner's hat on the 22nd of February—I told my sister to send the prisoner on an errand—he

left the hat and shoes under the window—I went to the hat, and found this pair of shoes covered over with an handkerchief—the officer found the other pair.





ROBERT DICK
. I am the officer. I searched the prisoner—I then went to his apartment, No. 46, Chick sand-street—I turned up the bed, and found between the sacking and the bed this pair of shoes—he told me he lived there.

Prisoner. I was in very great distress—my wife was very ill, and my wages were very low.
(John Butler, of Fleet-street-hill, and John Burket, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—Recommended to mercy by the prosecutrix.




Transported for Seven Years.

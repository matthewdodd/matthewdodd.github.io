JOHN COLLINS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
2nd of October, 4 spoons, value 15s.; and 1 brush, value 5s.; the goods of 



John Robson.






BRIDGET BRYAN
. I am servant to John Robson, at Fulham. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of October I saw the prisoner and another boy go out of the hall—I followed and asked how they came in, and they gave me no answer—when they got to the hall door they told me the men in the ground had sent them—I called to the men in the ground, and they

said they had sent no boys in—I then told the gardener to follow them, and the officer took the prisoner—I missed these spoons, which had been in the plate-basket by the bed-room door on the staircase, and the brush from the looking-glass drawer.





FRANCIS CRUTTENDEN
 (police-constable V 198.) I heard of this, went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him against the West London Cemetery—there were four boys together—they had got something in their hands looking at, and there was a boy behind on horseback—he put his finger into his mouth and made a whistle—the boys then turned, saw me, made a start, and left the prisoner—he put something through the cemetery rails—I took him, and found these things in the rails, and these papers that he had to sell.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. The others ran away? A. Yes—one of them was taken by another officer—the prisoner was younger than the others.





ROBERT SUTTLE
 (police constable B 97.) I took a boy named Jones, he is two or three-and-twenty years old.

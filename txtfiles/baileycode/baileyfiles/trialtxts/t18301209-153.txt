            . On the 20th of November I met the prisoner at seven o'clock in the morning, opposite the old steeple, in Church-street, Hackney, which is about five miles from the prosecutor's - he had a bundle; I asked what it was - he said a gig harness, which he was going to take to Hackney, and he had brought it from Leighton; I asked him several times where, and at last he said the Spread Eagle - I said I did not recollect there was such a sign; he said it was his master's, and he was going to get a horse and chaise for him - I detained him.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Hammer - he lives at Forest-gate, West-ham; this is his harness - I had locked it up safe in the stable on Friday night, the 19th of November; when I went the next morning, the door was broken open, and the lock forced off; I missed the harness - the officer found us out in about a week.
WILLIAM HAMMER. I live at Forest-gate


. This harness is mine - it was in my coach-house in my yard, separate from my house - I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to carry it to Hackney.

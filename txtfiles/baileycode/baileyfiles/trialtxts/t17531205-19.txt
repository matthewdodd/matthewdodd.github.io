            . On the first of November about seven in the evening, I was three or four doors from Catharine-street in the Strand


, talking to my fellow servant
, who was in a coach, and I standing by the side. I felt a hand in my pocket, and turning saw the prisoner take my silk handkerchief from my right pocket. I ran after him, and took him; there were two others with him, and I believe he gave it to one of them. He was never out of my sight till taken. I searched him, but did not find my handkerchief.

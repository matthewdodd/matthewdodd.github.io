            . The prisoner came to see a person that lodged in the house; after she was gone, I missed a capuchin out of the drawer; I took her up upon suspicion; she confessed she had taken it, and where she had pawned it. I went according to her directions, and there I found it, and here it is, (holding it in her hand ).

            . I am a pawnbroker; I took this capuchin in of the prisoner at the bar; I sent her 8 s. 6 d. upon it.

            . About three in the afternoon, this day six weeks, the prosecutrix came into her room, and laid her capuchin down, and it was gone presently; the prisoner was taken up, and she owned it directly.

I never was in the room; I took it up just by the door from off the ground.

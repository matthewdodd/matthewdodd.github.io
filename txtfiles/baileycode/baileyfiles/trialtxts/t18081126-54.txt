            . Q. You are export marker of the West India dock company - A. I am.
Q. Were you on duty at the West India dock


 on the 8th of October last - A. I was at the warehouse No. 4.
Q. While you were on duty that day did you see the prisoner there - A. I did; I was in the room before he came five minutes; it was in the attic room in the warehouse; I was in the room about twenty yards from where the prisoner came in; I was upon the top of the bags of coffee, and by my lying down upon the top of the bags, I was well aware the prisoner could not see me.
Q. What induced you to lye down - A. From the prisoner's manner of looking round cautiously when he came in; he then went to the desk which is in the same room.
COURT. What is the prisoner - A. He is a custom house locker
, and has the care of the coffee; after he had been to his desk, he returned to the door, and he looked cautiously up the passage; by way of seeing if any body was coming, he then returned to where there were some bags of coffee, put his hand into a hole in the bag, and put six or seven handfulls into his pocket; I then, as soon as an opportunity would allow, came down and informed the foreman of it.
Q. After having put six or seven handfulls in his pockets, did he go away - A. The foreman was coming up to the warehouse where the coffee was with a gang of men, he was looking out, and finding somebody was coming along the passage, he run quickly to the door; then the foreman came in, and as soon as opportunity would allow me I told the foreman, the foreman acquainted the captain of the warehouse, and so on to the constable; he was taken into custody in about half an hour after I had seen him take the coffee.

            . Q. You are a constable stationed at the West India docks - A. Yes; I was called upon to take the prisoner in custody; I searched him; I found two pounds and a half of raw coffee in his two pockets; I searched his house afterwards. The prisoner told me he had taken it out of a torn bag, and he meaned to put it into another; he said he had not taken it off the premises, and the law could not lay hold of him.

             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 29th of November
, one handkerchief, value 5 s., the goods of a 
                     man unknown


                  , from his person
            .

            . On the 29th of November, as the Queen was coming from St. Paul's to Piccadilly


, there were about two hundred thieves near Dorset-street. I saw Archer put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and take out his handkerchief. The gentleman was pushed into the crowd. I caught sight of them, in about three minutes, and saw Archer's hand in another gentleman's pocket. Creamer turned round and saw me - he then gave 
               Archer
             a nudge and both went off - we took them both. In Creamer's hat I found the handkerchief I first saw taken, and found one round his neck with

                  Roe
               



            ," marked on it. I found another in his hat. I did not see Archer give him the handkerchief.

            . I saw the prisoners, who were very active. I saw Creamer take off his hat and put something in it.

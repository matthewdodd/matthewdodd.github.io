            . I am a mariner
, On the 19th of September, I met the prisoner and another woman named Riddle, in New Gravel-lane. I took them to the Turk's Head to give them some liquor - I took out my pocketbook to pay for it, and pulled out a 10l.; and a 5l. bank note, besides a 1l. bank note, which I paid away - I then walked up a lane with them. I went up a one pair of stairs into a room with the prisoner - my back was towards her. In a few minutes I turned round and missed her - I also missed my pocket-book and money out of my jacket pocket, which was safe when I entered the room. I afterwards found her in custody in Field-lane-the other girl had given information - I am sure she is the woman. I was quite sober.
JOHN KENSEY. I am an officer. On the 20th of September, I went with the prosecutor, to look for the girl. We took her in Field-lane-the mob rescued her from me. I afterwards found her in custody at Union Hall, on the 1st of October. She said that she had got rid of the whole of the money, and she gave the 10l. note to a jew in Cow-cross, with whom she cohabited, and bought clothes with the rest.

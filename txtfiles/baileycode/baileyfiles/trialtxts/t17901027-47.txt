            , Esq. sworn.
Between one and two, the 8th of October, I was crossing from Cornhill


 to go into Lombard-street, in the narrow alley that goes into Change-alley, I felt some thing at my pocket; I immediately put my hand to my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone; I turned round, and seized the prisoner, and said, you have picked my pocket; on searching the prisoner, I found a handkerchief concealed upon him, which I knew to be mine; I have kept it ever since; it is a linen handkerchief; the prisoner begged I would forgive him.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going up a narrow passage, and saw the handkerchief laying on the ground, and took it up; the gentleman said, I had his handkerchief: I said, I had not.

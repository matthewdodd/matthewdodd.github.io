            , I was sitting at my supper, at about a quarter before nine on the night of the say in the indictment, and I heard a kind of crack at the shop window, and both my wife and my servant ran out to the door; in a few minutes, I was called into the shop, and my servant pointed out the prisoner as one of the men who took the pantaloons; and who had hit her a punch in the stomach; I went after him and brought him back again.

            . This man at the bar was one with two others, who took the pantaloons, and ran away; he knocked me down. I am sure the prisoner was one.

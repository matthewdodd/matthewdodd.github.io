GEORGE ANDERSON



, stealing 1 snuff-box, value 5s.; from the person of a man unknown; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM HAMILTON
. I am a warehouseman, and live at Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate. On 15th Jan., about half-past two o'clock, I saw the prisoner following a gentleman down Cornhill, he put his hand into his pocket, took a box out, and made off—I followed, he struck me in the face, I fell, got up again and pursued him—he fell down, and was taken by Hill—the box was found close by him—I have not been able to find the gentleman.





WILLIAM HILL
 (City policeman, 405.) I heard a cry of "Stop theif!" and saw the prisoner and Hamilton running—the prisoner fell down by Mansion-house-place—I took him, and found this box by him—it has been advertised, but we cannot find the owner—Hamilton made the same statement that he does now.

Prisoner's Defence. Two men asked me to buy the box; I gave them 2s., and a pot of beer for it.





ROBINSON WEBB
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Aug., 1847, and confined three months)—he is the man—he had had three months before that.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

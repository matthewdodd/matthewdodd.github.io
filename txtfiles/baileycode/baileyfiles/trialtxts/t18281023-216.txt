            . On the 20th of October, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner near Mr. Wyatt's shop, in Little Guildford-street


, with two other persons; I watched them ten minutes walking and looking into the shop, which is an oyster-shop; I saw the prisoner take the tub of oysters from the shop, and hand it to another person he did not go into the shop; he stood at the door, and took it out; I gave an alarm to Mr. Wyatt, and he took the prisoner - he was never out of my sight, except while I ran down stairs; I am sure of his person.
THOMAS WYATT. I took the prisoner - he was close to my door; I took him immediately; he had got a few oysters, but I never saw the tub, nor the greater part of the oysters.

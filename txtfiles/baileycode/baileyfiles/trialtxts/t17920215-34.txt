             sworn.
The prisoner came to our house on the 30th of January, about five o'clock; the candles were not lighted; he came in, and desired to see some handkerchiefs; there were several customers in the shop; my two brothers were in the shop; they are my partners; their names are Alexander and 
               
                  Charles
                   Blythe
               



            ; I shewed him three pieces; they are silk handkerchiefs; in the mean time he took a piece out of the shop; he pushed them all together, and asked the price; I said, 4 s. 6 d. he offered 3 s. 6 d. there was another boy along with him; we missed one piece as soon as he was gone out of the shop; I did not see him separate that one from the other; he walked out as soon as he said we could not agree; I was suspicious of him, and as soon as I missed it I went after him up Long-lane, and there I saw him take it from under his coat, and throw it down; after he dropped the goods, I lost him; I pursued him, and he was brought back in five or six minutes; the goods were picked up by a stranger, and brought back to our shop; it contains fourteen handkerchiefs; they are worth sixty-four shillings. (Produced.) The other boy went out with the prisoner.

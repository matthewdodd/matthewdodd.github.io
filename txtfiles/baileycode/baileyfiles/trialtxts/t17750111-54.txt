            . I am a linen draper
. I lost three pieces of linen check on the 18th of December that were hung up before my door; I had seen them at one o'clock, which was about an hour before I missed them.

            . I saw the Prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, walking up and down before the prosecutor's door; I thought him not likely to be a purchaser, and suspecting he had some bad intention, I watched him, and I saw him take three pieces of cheek and put them under his coat, and then he pulled his coat off and wrapped them up in it. I collared the prisoner, and called 
               
                  John
                   Sadler
               



             to my assistance: between us we secured him and the cloth.


                  John
                   Sadler
               



            . I took the prisoner at the request of the last witness. I saw the three pieces of cloth upon him.
They were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.

                  Alves 
               



            . I am a Portuguese, servant
 to Mr. Bristow; we lodge at the house of Mr. Hennington, a fishmonger at Charing-cross


; the prisoner was servant
 to Mr. Hennington; I missed seven guineas last Thursday out of my bureau; I suspected the prisoner, and took her up before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; going along, she confessed she took my money out of my bureau, and had spent it all; she confessed the same before Sir John.

                  Hennington 
               



            . I live at Charing-cross, Mr. Alves lodges in my house; he complained to me last Thursday that he missed some money out of his bureau; as we had no body in the house but my wife and daughter, besides the prisoner, we suspected her; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             for his advice; he advised me to take her up with a constable; I took her up, and charged her with taking it; I said, Betty, you had better own it, we will make it as easy as we can with Mr. Bristow; she at first denied it very strongly; we went up and looked in her box, and found only about 6 d. in halfpence; then the constable said, take her before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; we called a coach; going along, she said if we would stop the coach, she would tell; we stopped, and went into a public-house; she confessed she had taken about six guineas out of a purse which was in the prosecutor's bureau, she likewise confessed the same before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            . We asked her what she had done with it; she said she had bought some cloth for shifts, and an apron or two; we saw the cloth, it was not to the value of the money; then she said she had disposed of five or six guineas to a young man that came from her mother, that was going abroad.

Prisoner's defence.
I never did such a thing before.

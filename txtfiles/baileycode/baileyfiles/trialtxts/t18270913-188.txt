RICHARD MILLEN. I live in Cow-cross-street


; I am a broker
. On the 5th of August about six o'clock in the afternoon, this time-piece stood in my shop about six yards from the back part; I was in the parlour, and heard the shop door open; I went in, and the prisoner had moved this time-piece about four yards, and was putting it into a pail, which he had brought with him. When I saw him, he pretended that he wanted to sell the pail.

            . I am a watch-flutcher. I was returning home, and saw the prisoner with a pail in Cow-cross-street - I thought it was curious to carry it on a Sunday, and I watched him to the shop; I saw him with the timepiece in his hand.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had gone to the shop to sell the pail, but denied having touched the time-piece.

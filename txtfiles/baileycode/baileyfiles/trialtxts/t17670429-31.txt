            . On the 26th of March I lost a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of sheepskin breeches. (The indictment is wrong, I did not lose velvet breeches.) I found my things again at Mr. Master's, a pawnbroker, about three hours after they were taken. My apprentice had seen the prisoner go in there with a bundle; he came and told me. I am a shoemaker
; the prisoner lodged with me, and worked for me. I desired him to stop him if he came again.
Mr. Masters. The prisoner brought a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of leather breeches, and pledged them to me the 26th of March; the prosecutor came and owned them, and desired me to stop him if he came again. He came again in about three hours after for more money, and I stopt him. I asked him how he came to take his master's things; he said he did it in order to keep it up; that is, I suppose, to keep up his frolick. He was very drunk.
Prisoner's defence.
What I did I did with honesty; I did not do it with intent to defraud.

            . The Prisoner came into my Shop the 19th of July, to pawn a Shirt. I was above Stairs, but I had left a little Girl in the Shop, and while the Girl was calling me, the Prisoner (it seems) run away with these Things; for when I came down Stairs, the Girl was bellowing at the Door, and told me that that Lady there at the Bar, was gone off with the Bundle. I sent the Girl after her, and the Mob took her.

            . The Girl. I saw her with my own Eyes take the Bundle and run away with it, while I was calling my Mistress. I ran after her, and she was taken with the Goods upon her.
The Constable. She was brought to my House by the Mob, and these Things were upon her.
Ward. These are the Things she took out of the Shop.

            . I saw the Prisoner go into the Shop with one Bundle, and come out again with two. I can swear to the Parcel in the checqu'd Apron.
Defence. I am sure I know nothing of the Matter: I was very much in Liquor, and was very Sick with Drinking some out-of-the-way nasty Stuff. O Pray burn me, burn my Hand off, but don't send me away; I'll never go into a Ginshop any more, if you wont send me over Sea. 

               Guilty

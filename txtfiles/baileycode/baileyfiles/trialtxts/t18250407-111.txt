; I did not see it taken; I saw the prisoner in about two minutes afterwards running down the road with it - he dropped it in my presence, after the cry of Stop thief! was raised; I lost sight of him for about half a minute, but he was stopped in a short time.
Prisoner. Q. What do you know me by? A. By your dress - you had a black handkerchief on and a dark coat.

            . I live at Oldford, with Mr. Cox, a butcher. I saw Marshall with his cart on the 24th of February; he was by the side of his horses in Bow; I saw the prisoner on the cart, and then he leaned over and took something out; I did not know what it was, but I afterwards saw the coat; I told Marshall of it, and ran after the prisoner, I did not lose sight of him till he was taken; he dropped it after we cried Stop thief! I never lost sight of him till he was taken.

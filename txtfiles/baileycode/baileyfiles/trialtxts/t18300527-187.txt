WILLIAM DIXON. I am a carpenter
. On Wednesday I was at a house at Camden-town


; the prisoner was at work there - I went into the drawing room at four o'clock instead of going to tea, and soon after I heard a noise in the parlour; I looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner going down a ladder, and go towards the Camden Arms - I missed the plane; I followed and took him just beyond the Camden Arms, with it under his jacket.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been making a box at home and took the plane to do it.

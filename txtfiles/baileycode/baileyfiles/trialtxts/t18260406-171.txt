JANE MORRIS. I live in James-street


, and keep a greengrocer's shop
. The prisoner was quite a stranger; I had ever seen him till I saw him in the shop; on the 27th of February, when I was at dinner, and through my little window I saw a boy in the shop; I ran in, and saw him there, and there was a piece of work at the door; some person said,"There are thieving boys about," and a young woman said, "Look if you have been robbed?" the prisoner stood there all the time, but when I looked round, and saw I had lost the money from my till, he ran away, and Mr. Lamb followed him.

            . On the 27th of February I heard an alarm of Stop thief! I came out, and said, "What is the matter?" a woman said a boy had robbed a till, and directed me to follow him - I followed him into a house, then into a yard, and then into a place like a dust-hole -he then went into a back kitchen, and got up a chimney - I found a short ladder, and put it up the chimney, and sent a man to the top, to take care of him if he got up, but he came down - he gave up the half-crown, sixpence, and three pence, which he had, and begged we would not prosecute him, as he might be transported.

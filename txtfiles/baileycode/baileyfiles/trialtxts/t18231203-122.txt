            . On the 31st of October, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in Piccadilly - the prisoner and another woman accosted me, and asked me to give her sixpence. I wished to get rid of them; they followed me a long way, and at last I gave her sixpence; she still followed me, down to Sherrard-street. I threatened several times to give her in charge, and in Sherrard-street


 (I had a cloak on), she put her head down to my neck, and took my breast pin out with her mouth. I secured her, and gave her in charge.

            . I am a watchman, and received her in charge. Mr. Bath offered her 5 s. to return the pin - she denied it.

            . I am constable of the night. About half-past twelve o'clock at night, when the prisoner was in the watch-house, I found the breast pin in her left hand.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met the gentleman; he gave me 6 d., and after talking some time, asked me to step into a court - I was three-quarters of an hour there. The watchman told us to move on, and he charged me with taking his pin, which he gave me instead of money.
MR. BATH. It is false.

ANN COVENTRY
. I am the wife of William Coventry. We live in Old-street, St. Luke's, and are linen-drapers—on the 6th of June, we had twenty yards of silk, and forty-five pocket-handkerchiefs, about a quarter of a yard from the window, tied up in a bundle—they and the silk were worth more than 5l.—they were inside the shop—I received information, and missed them—the window had been cut that day fortnight by the prisoner—he came to my house, and cut the pane of glass quite down—I saw him do it, and then he ran away—I sent a little girl after him—he had cut the glass straight down, but there was no hole made then—on the 6th of June, I examined it, and a piece of glass was taken away, and a hole made, big enough to take any thing out.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. You saw this man about a fortnight before? A. Yes; on a Saturday, about twelve o'clock in the day—I was by the side of the counter, in the shop—there was nothing in the window which prevented my seeing into the street—I just turned my head and saw him—he looked at me, and walked away—I did not see him for more than a minute—I had not seen him before he cut the window, but can swear to him—I had put these things into the window at half-past eleven o'clock, and at five or ten minutes past twelve they were all taken—I did not see Tool till I sent for him on the Monday after.





THOMAS TOOL
. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in Old-street. On the 6th of June, I saw the prisoner and two others opposite this lady's window—I saw them go over two or three times, and come back—I knew the prisoner, and was afraid he would notice me, as he had threatened me before—they then went to the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner break the glass with a knife or something—he took a piece of glass out, and pulled a wire out of his hat, and pulled something out of the window, which he gave to the other two who were with him—I saw they were black handkerchiefs—they put them inside their coats, and walked away—I could not see a policeman—they got to the first turning, and then ran—Most sight of them—I saw a policeman afterwards, and told him.

Cross-examined. Q. How many times have you been a witness here? A. I do not know; I was repremanded for prevarication through Mr. Murphy, but I have got a true bill returned against him now, for assaulting and wounding me—the Judge did not tell me, the last time I was here, not to show my face again—he said it would be at well not to come—I was only told that once—I have been repremanded two or three times—I did not go to Mr. Coventry's that day, because I was very ill, and I did not see a policeman—I did not want to trouble myself about it.

Q. Were not you a witness at Bow-street, accusing a roan of robbery, when a policeman of the F. division swore you were in the habit of being with a gang of thieves? A. He said he had been told so by another officer—the Magistrate did not say that if I went there again he would give me three months—he told me not to trouble myself with the police—

the prisoner was remanded for his friends to come forward—I do not know what was said against me.





MARIA HARDY
. I was in the street, and saw the prisoner standing at the prosecutor's shop window—I ran against him—it was at five minutes past twelve o'clock, on the 6th of June.

Cross-examined. Q. What did he say? A. I ran against him, and he said,—n my eyes, could not I see where I was going—I turned and said, "Well, I am sure, you are a nice man"—he was then close to Mrs. Coventry's window—he was not doing any thing then.





HENRY BUCKERIDGE
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner—I founds a wire in his hat, and a tobacco-box on him—he said he was innocent, and that he was not in Old-street that day—he knew nothing at all about it—he said, before the Magistrate, that he was at home.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at home at work at the time—were the people out of the country here, they would have proved it—they are in Yorkshire—that bit of wire I picked up.

                  Thomas 
                  Roberts 
               



            . On the evening of the 25th of Nov. I received a letter from Mr. Ware, a Silk-Throwster in Goodman's Fields, the purport of which was to let me know there was great reason to suspect I had been defrauded, and that the person suspected was in custody, and desired I would come to him immediately. I had not miss'd any thing then. I went accordingly, and Mr. Ware and I went together to Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , where Lillwall, the prisoner, had been, but was then sent to New Prison. I found at Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            's a large quantity of goods. Produc'd in court, and depos'd to. Silk and worsted bed-lace and incle; it was manufactured for bed-lace, the silk was for the worst. Watkins was my servant
, the other prisoner is his own mother.
Q. Where have these goods been ever since?
Roberts. They have been ever since in my custody; Watkins was taken before the lord-mayor, and there confess'd he and his mother had made a practice of robbing me; he was order'd to the Compter; the next day he was brought there again, and repeated his former confession, saying, they were his master's property and that he believed this parcel was all that ever he had wrong'd me of since he lived with me, for his mother had not disposed of any to his knowledge; and that he liv'd with me five months before he robb'd me at all.
Q. Did the woman confess any thing?
Roberts. I did not hear her examination.


                  William 
                  Ledger 
               



            . The woman gave me one skane of this silk to sell the 25th of Nov. last, and said she thought she had about a pound and half more of it; I carried it to Mr. Ware in Goodman's Fields, he suspecting it not to be honestly come by, stopp'd it and me, and went to search her house.
Q. from Anne Lillwall. Did not I give you that ounce of silk to pay your lodging?
Ledger. No, you gave it me to sell, and said you had more of it.


                  Peter 
                  Ware 
               



            . (He produces same silk,) This is the sample of silk that was brought to me by 
               
                  William 
                  Ledger 
               



            , the last witness, to sell; he told me the woman said there were six pounds of it, and that she had it of a son of hers, from Herefordshire, that owed her money; he left the sample with me, and I went and shew'd it to my brother when he came from 'Change; and when he saw it he said he believ'd it was a fraud, and sent for an officer and stopp'd the porter. I went to Lillwall's house, where she shew'd me one parcel of it, and said she did o' care to sell it then, but would sell it on the Monday. I went back and acquainted my brother what I saw; we sent for a constable, who came, and went with me to her house, and I told her I had brought a weaver with me (he having a green apron on) to see the silk; she would not let him nor me see it; then I said, to be plain with her he was an officer, and charg'd him with her: then she shew'd this quantity that is produc'd here; there were 52 skanes of worsted in the room, besides the silk and other goods. Then I left them, and went and fetch'd my brother, and in taking some silk out of a chest, we found an alehouse pot lying hid under it, which gave us more suspicion. We took her and the goods before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , who ask'd her how she came by these goods. she said from out of Heresordshire from a son of hers for a debt.
Q. When did she say this?
Ware. On Saturday the 25th of Nov. I was before my lord-mayor, when Watkins made his confession that he took the goods from Mr. Roberts's shop, and gave them to his mother as she came backwards and forwards to see him at several times.


                  Samuel 
                  Ware 
               



            . I am a Silk-throwster; when I came from the Exchange my brother, the last evidence, told me he thought there was a defraud, that a porter had come two or three times with silk, &c. I secured the porter in my house, and sent my brother to the woman's lodgings, where afterwards I went and found all these goods (produc'd here) in her lodgings, and the goods and she were carried to Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            's; there she said she had them from Herefordshire ; I knew there was no such thing manufactured there. She was committed to New Prison for further examination, and soon after Mr. Roberts came and own'd the goods; and on the Monday morning the woman was brought before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , and then committed to Newgate; Mr. Roberts had fetch'd Watkins from out of the hospital on the Sunday morning. I then went before my lord-mayor, who said he would hear it himself; Watkins there confess'd he had injured a good master, and said he took the things and gave them to his mother.
Q. What did she say?
Ware. She said, if it is so as my son has confessed and told the truth, we are both very wicked.
Q. Where was this?
Ware. She said so at Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gower 
               



            's, being told there what Watkins had confessed.

Roberts. I thought Watkins to be a very honest lad; and trusted him with the key were these goods were ; he had been very ill before he went into the hospital; when she used to come to see him on Sundays, and at other times.
Watkins's Defence.
I was very ill in my master's house near two months, being lame and unable to stir; I was continually in the shop after the other person came home; I went to the hospital I and was there between 7 and 8 weeks; my master came there one morning and took me out of bed and had me away; I was commited to Woodstreet Compter, and remain'd there till the next day, being Monday: then they brought me before my Lord mayor : they put me in a slutter: Mr. Ware said the goods were my master's property, I did not say positively they were.
Lillwall's Defence.
I own the goods to be my property; they came to me instead of money, from my eldest son that lives in Herefordshire ; they were sent from there.
For Watkins.

            . I keep the Dolphin in Honeylane-market; Watkins was servant with me about a year and half, he behaved very honest and just, for what ever I found.

                  Mason 
               



            . Watkins lodged at my mother in law's house, I never knew any harm by him.
Q. When was this?
Mason. Before he liv'd with Mr. Mason, he was then looking out for a place.
Q. from Watkins. Ask my master, Mr. Roberts, what a character he had with me?
Roberts to the Q. I had a very good character of him from two or three places, I trusted him with the key to lock up these things, or he had not had the opportunity of robbing me; which according to his own confession, was by the instigation of his mother.
For Lillwall.

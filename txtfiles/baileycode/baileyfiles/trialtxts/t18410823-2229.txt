JOHN BARKER
. I live in Old-street, and am a cab driver. On the 25th of August I drove my cab to the Old-street rank—I went into a public-house, and was there about a quarter of an hour—I came out, and missed this coat, which I had left on my cab.






WILLIAM BROWN CROSS
 (police-constable G 217.) At half-past eight o'clock that evening I was in Cowper-street, and stopped the prisoner with this coat—he said it was his own, and he had brought it from home—that was about a quarter of an hour after the prosecutor left it on the cab.

Transported for Seven Years.

ELIZABETH WINTERINGHAM
. I am a servant to Mr. Dobie, of Lancasterplace, Strand. About twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, on the 19th of September, my watch hung over the dresser, in the kitchen—(the prisoner had come the day before with our baker, to see the customers before he entered the service)—I saw him come down the area steps on the 19th—I then went to answer the house-bell—the cook missed the watch, and asked me where it was—when I missed it I went and saw the prisoner at the dust-hole—I accused him of having taken it—he said he had not got it—no one else had been down—I saw the policeman find it in an empty flowerpot in the dust-hole—this is it—(looking at one)—it is mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Who did you leave in the kitchen? A. Two children—the baker sent them out of the kitchen—the cook had gone to market—I had seen the watch exactly twenty minutes before twelve o'clock.





SUSAN RESTALL
. I am the cook. I had been to market, I returned and missed the watch—I met the prisoner coming out of the kitchen-door, he went to the dust-hole in the area—I told the prosecutrix, and I heard he go to the door, but I did not follow her—the watch was found in a flower-pot in the dust, where he was standing.





CHARLES POCOCH
 (police-constable F 116.) I was sent for, and found the watch.

Cross-examined. Q. Were there not three other policemen there? A. There were two in the kitchen when I arrived, and one on the top of the

stairs—I heard one of Mr. Dobie's clerks say that the dust-hole had been searched—I had no difficulty in finding it—I removed the flower-pots—there were about a dozen—they stood in lots—the watch was found in a pot with three more pots covered over it.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—

Transported for Seven Years.

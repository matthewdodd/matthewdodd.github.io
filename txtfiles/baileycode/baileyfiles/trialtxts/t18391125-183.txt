RICHARD WARREN DYER
. I keep a grocer's shop in Mary-street; Stepney. On the 15th of November, about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner entered my shop under the pretence of purchasing a halfpenny-worth of string—I showed him several sorts, and no kind seemed to suit—while I turned my back to get some, he put his hand in my weight box, and took out the brass pound weight—he went out, and joined two other boys—I followed him to several other shops—a shopkeeper detained him—I stepped over and took him—I do not know what became of the weight—the other two boys had gone off—while the prisoner was in my shop, the other two, who were outside, kept saying, "Thicker, thinner," and so on, and the prisoner said, "D—n the string altogether, it won't do."

Prisoner's Defence. The string was not thick enough—about twenty minutes after I went to another shop, and there they had not any thick enough—I said, "I will keep the halfpenny till I get another"—then this man came and took Mr.

re-examined. I saw him take the weight—he passed it to the others who were at the door—I should have taken him then, but I wished to take the others—he passed the weight while I was turning to get the string—my quarter of a pound scales were on the counter—he took the beam and rattled it, then dropped the beam, took the weight, and passed it out.

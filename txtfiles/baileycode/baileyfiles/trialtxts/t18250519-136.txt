            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I met the prisoner about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, on the 18th of May, in Crown-street, Soho, with this portmanteau concealed under his coat; I asked him where he got it? he said from No. 46, Oxford-street, and was going to take itto his father; I said I would go to where he had got it from, and then he told me another story; I was taking him to the office and met the owner.
JAMES WYER. I am a trunk-maker
, and live in Oxford-street


. This is my portmanteau; it was safe in my shop about twenty minutes before ten o'clock that morning, when I went out.

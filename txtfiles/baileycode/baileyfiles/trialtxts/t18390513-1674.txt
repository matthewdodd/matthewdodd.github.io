1674. 




WILLIAM AUGUSTUS GRANTHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of May, 1 waistcoat, value 10s.; and 1 handkerchief, value 2d.; the goods of 



Daniel Edward Colston; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






DANIEL EDWARD COLSTON
. I live in Field-place, Kensington, and am an upholsterer. About three or four o'clock, on the 8th of May, I was in my counting-house—I heard the side-door which opens into the passage shut—I went out, and saw the prisoner stepping off the threshold of the door—I came up to him—seeing something bulky under his jacket, I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing of yours—it belongs to my brother"—I put my hand in, and pulled out this jacket, which is mine, and had been hanging up in the passage—I knew nothing of the prisoner—he had no right there—this handkerchief belongs to one of my children.





JOSEPH STILES
. I was called in, and took the prisoner.





MICHAEL BROWN
 (police-sergeant T 22.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

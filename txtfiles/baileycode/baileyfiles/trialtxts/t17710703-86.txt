                   Bonham
               



            . I am a jeweller, and live in Foundery court, Lothbury


. The prisoner at the bar came to my shop on the fourteenth of September, about eleven o'clock; he had been two or three days before, and left word he would call next morning; he appeared very well dressed; he told me he wanted a diamond ring; I shewed him several; we agreed for the value; the price was twenty-seven pounds; he beat me down as low as he could, because he said it was ready money; he opened his pocket-book and gave me this draft for thirty-five pounds, (producing a banker's check) and desired me to give him the balance, which I did, which was eight guineas, and there were some few shillings I was to allow for paying ready money, which he was to call for in two or three days, but he never called again; he went away with the: ring and the eight guineas.
Q. When he presented the draft, was there nothing said about it?
Bonham. It was a check draft, and as I knew the banker, I had no doubt about it: I asked him what his name was; he said 
               
                  Thomas
                   Williamson
               



            : I asked him who recommended him; he said Mr. Thompson, at a coffee-house by the Exchange; I knew one of that name very well, and thought it was him: I sent the draft to Mr. Gines's, to desire him to put it to my account, as I kept cash there; I found it was a fraud; I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; he was taken up about May; I think it was some months after. Before he was taken up, I had notice to come to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; there I found the prisoner: there was half a score people; I was ordered into the room; they asked me if I should know him; I said I believed I should; they told me to find him out; I picked him out at once: when I had patched upon him, I had my man with me that knew him by sight, he pitched upon the same man. I was ordered to attend Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             the Wednesday following; I did; he said before the justice I had used him ill; I had sold him a ring a good deal above the value, and that the ring fetched but sixteen pounds. I was bound over to prosecute. (The note is read.)

London Sept. 14, 1770.
Mess. Gines and Atkinson, pay to 
               
                  Thomas
                   Williamson
               



            , or bearer, thirty five pounds, eight shillings.
R. Winnist.
35 l. 8 s. 0 d.
Q. from the Prisoner. How many were the odd shillings?
Bonham. I think, ten shillings.
Prisoner. The prosecutor says I said at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, he used me ill, the ring fetched but sixteen pounds: he said he did not know me. Did not Bureau say, It is not me.
Bonham. Far from it; I knew him very well; Bureau said he was a party with him; that they had divided the money between them.
Q. from the Prisoner. He says I came to him by the name of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Williamson
               



            ; how could he know I was Gumpay Humphreys.
Bonham. I heard of several people that had been taken in the same manner.
Prisoner. I never was before a court in my life before. My name is not Gumpay Humphreys.
Court. If not so, you should not have pleaded to the name.
Prisoner. There may be more men than one of that name: I never was before a court in my life.
Q. from Court. Was the draft ready filled up when it was presented to you?
Bonham. Yes.


                  John
                   Sibley
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Bonham. On Tuesday, the eleventh of September, the prisoner came to my master's house, and asked if the gentleman was within; I said, No; he said he wanted to look at a diamond ring or two; that he would call in the morning: he did not come in the morning, but the next day; but on the Thursday my master was not at home; he came again the next day; I asked him his name; he said it was very immaterial, my master did not know him: he came on the fourteenth; I saw him that day, when he went; I was not present when the draft was given. I did not see any thing that passed between my master and him: I was sent with the draft afterwards to the bankers; they said it was a false draft.
Q. from the Prisoner. Do you recollect what he said before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ; how many men did you see come to enquire for your master?
Sibley. Two men came.
Prisoner. How do you know who paid the draft to your master?
Court. He did not say you did; he says you was at the house that morning, and there twice before, wanting to look at some diamond rings.
Prisoner. Whether Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             did not refuse to give him his oath, and took the book out of his hand?
Sibley. No.
Prisoner. Do you know how your master came to know my name was Gumpay Humphreys?
Sibley. No.
Prisoner. How came your master to take me?
Sibley. Because I suppose he thought you the right man.
Q. to Prosecutor from the Prisoner. Did you say when you first came in that you did not know me?
Bonham. No.
Mr. 
               
                  William
                   Gines
               



            . This draft was brought to me about the day of the date of it, by 
               
                  John
                   Sibley
               



            . The purpose for which it was brought was, that it might be entered on Mr. Bonham's book; he kept cash at our house. I refused to do it, and told him that this Winnest, the pretended drawer of this draft, was a person unknown to me. I never had any account or connexion whatever with any person of that name, nor do I know that there is any such person existing. I was present at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's when Mr. Keeling officiated for Sir John at the examination of the prisoner. Mr. Bonham was sworn. A number of persons were brought into the room, I believe not less than twenty, that Mr. Bonham might fix on the culprit, and Mr. Bonham did so; he very calmly and sedately looked round the room from man to man, and he did deliberately fix upon the prisoner, and said, That is the man. Mr. Bonham's servant, who stood by, did not at all interfere; but some time after his matter had thus fixed upon the prisoner, he spoke, an said, That is the man; I perfectly know the man. At the second examination, the prisoner said, You little jeweller, how should you advertise that I had defrauded you of a diamond ring of twenty-seven pounds value, and eigh guineas. Know, there is a balance of money due to me. You know you owe me the odd shillings upon the balance. Don't you know (says the prisoner) that I was to call upon you for the balance. To which Mr. Bonham replied, Aye, but you knew better things than to call upon me. Sir John said, I thought you was going to ask Mr. Bonham such questions as might induce us to believe you innocent. Don't you know you are confirming your own guilt?
Q. from the prisoner. You seem to be so exact in every thing that passed; pray, can you recollect how many odd shillings I mentioned to Mr. Bonham were owing to me?
Gines. I can't recollect exactly.
Court. Prisoner, that sort of behaviour will not be of use to you; conduct yourself with decency becoming your situation.
Prisoner. I know myself innocent; therefore I hope your lordship will permit me to ask such questions as I think necessary.
Court. You may ask any questions that may be of service to you, but don't be so flippant.
Prisoner. When Mr. Bonham was desired to pick out the man, whether he did not say he could not swear to the man, as it was six months ago?
Mr. Gines. Mr. Bonham did not say that, he walked round Sir John's office with great caution; he said it was six months ago; and after he had deliberately walked round from man to man, he fixed upon the prisoner.
Prisoner. Did Mr. Bonham intimate that he said no more about it, because I cleared it up so plain: this Davis would have been a material witness with regard to my innocence. I will call a witness to prove that one Humphreys paid away drafts many times: my name is 
               
                  Gumpay
                   Humphreys Eliezer
               



            .
For the Prisoner.


                  Jacob
                   Eliezer
               



            .
Q. What did Mr. Bonham declare before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ?
Eliezer. The justice desired us all to walk into the room, every man that was there; I was present; I stood next the prisoner at the bar: Mr. Bonham then, after looking some time, looked very hard at me, that I was thinking he would say I was the person; he said he did not know the man, and it was six or nine months ago: this was the first time of the examination: he said he did not know the man, being six months ago.
Court. Tell me the very words?
Eliezer. He did not know the man, being six months ago; perhaps the man might have altered in the time: one Mr. Bureau standing next to him and Mr. Bond, Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's clerk pointed with a pen at the prisoner; when he pointed with a pen, 
               
                  Abraham
                   Bureau
               



             made answer, That is Mr. Humphrys; he made answer to him in Hebrew, that he should not be afraid, for he would come through it.
Q. Before that, had Mr. Bonham fixed upon Humphrys at all?
Eliezer. No; he was looking all round the room, and could not see the man; and looked very hard upon me, being of the same size.
Q. He had not challenged the prisoner as being the man till Bond pointed with the pen to him, and Bureau said, That is Mr. Humphrys?
Eliezer. No; he did not say he knew him till Bureau said, That is Mr. Humphrys.
Q. Then he had not fixed upon Humphrys till after Bureau said, That is Mr. Humphrys.
Eliezer. No.
Q. How did he fix upon him then?
Eliezer. He said he believed it was him, but put on his spectacles at the same time, and said, that being six or eight months ago, he could not be sure as to his person; he said a man might alter in six or seven months.
Q. Is that all that passed?
Eliezer. All that passed at that time.
Q. Upon the first examination, did Mr. Bonham speak positive to Humphrys, or not?
Eliezer. After Bureau said it was him, he said the same, that it was Mr. Humphreys.
Q. You told me just now that he believed it was, but it was six months ago, and a man might alter his face?
Eliezer. He said so, and that a man might alter his speech too: twenty people were present.
The Jury. This witness, I believe, was in court during the examination.
Q. Was you in court?
Eliezer. Yes; I was in court.


                  Mary
                   Emanuel
               



            . I have known the prisoner from a boy.
Q. What way of life is he in?

Emanuel. I don't know any further than that he is a very sober, honest, young man; I never heard any thing amiss of him.
Court. If you don't know how he gets his living, I shall ask you no more of his character.
Emanuel. His father was a tea-merchant in Angel-alley, Church-street.
Prisoner's Defence.
It was a piece of malice; I was ordered last sessions to be admitted to bail; Mr. Gines and Mr. Benham desired them not to bail me, that I might not go about to get my witnesses myself.

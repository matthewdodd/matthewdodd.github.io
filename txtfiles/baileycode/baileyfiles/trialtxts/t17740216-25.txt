            . On the 17th of January I had been at Justice Wilmot's; I had a warrant to execute at St. Martin's-le-grand; the prisoner came with me to the city; among other places we called at the Poultry Compter. Afterwards, while we were at a cook's shop, a man came in from a place where we had been, and said he had lost a silver milk pot; upon which we were all examined; and the pint pot belonging to Mr. Stokes was found in the prisoner's pocket; we sent to Stokes; he could not come; we took the pot and the prisoner to him, and he gave charge of him.

             deposed that the pot produced was his property.

            . I was sent by a person who had lost a milk pot to search several persons, and found this pint pot in the pocket of the prisoner.

            . I was at the Poultry Compter: I believe the prisoner took it out of the prison.
The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a very good character.

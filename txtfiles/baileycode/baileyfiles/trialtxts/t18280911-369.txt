JOHN JAMES HODGSON. On the 28th of July, I was in Bath-place, New-road


 - I left my handkerchief go, turned round, and saw the prisoner with it in her hand; I seized her, but she was too strong for me; I called the watch, but no one came; I pulled a second time, and she let go of it.
Prisoner. I did not take it from his person - I am an unfortunate girl, and was with him for half an hour - he told him to feel in his pocket to see if he had any money; he said I carried him across the road; and he said "You hussy, if there was a watchman I would give you in charge;" I was on the other side of the way - he saw a watchman by the Adam and Eve - he crossed over, and gave charge of me; I have no parents or friends.
JOHN JAMES HODGSON. I was not in her company at all - she did drag me across the road, and asked me for 2d.; I would not give it her, and she took my handkerchief.

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor came up to me, and gave the prisoner in charge - at the watch-house, he gave me the handkerchief from his pocket.

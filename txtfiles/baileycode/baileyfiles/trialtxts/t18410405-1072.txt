WILLIAM KING
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
5th of March, 13 1/4 lbs. weight of cheese, value 6s., the goods of 



John Green and another.






HENRY CURTIS
. I am in the employ of a town carman. On the 5th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was employed to carry some cheeses to Harrison's wharf—they were the property of John Green and another—they were in a close cart, which had a tilt over it—I believe there were forty-one cheeses in one lot and twenty in another—I saw the prisoner behind my cart, and the tilt was removed—I went on to the Dublin steam-wharf, and saw the prisoner again behind the cart—he made a rush and ran—I pursued and collared him—I never lost sight of him—he had this cheese with him—I looked into the cart, and missed one cheese, and this one tallies with the one I lost.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where did you see the cheese again? A. In between the prisoner's feet, about ten or twenty yards from the cart—the tailboard of my cart was up, within about three inches of the top—this cheese is about five inches wide—there was not room for it to roll out—I saw the prisoner drop it between his feet—he did not attempt to escape—the officer was up to him as soon as me.





THOMAS KAY
 (police-constable H 101.) I was standing at the horse's head when the cheese was taken out of the cart—I saw the carman ran behind the cart very quickly, I followed him, he cried out, "Police "—I said, "Here I am"—he said, "I charge this man with stealing this cheese"—it laid at his feet, and the witness had hold of his collar.




GUILTY
.† Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

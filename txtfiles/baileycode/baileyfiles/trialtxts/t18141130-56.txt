            . I am a farmer
, residing at Yousley, near the canal


. On Sunday morning I went into my rick-yard; I missed some hay about eight o'clock in the morning. I tracked the hay out of my rick-yard all the way to Chapman's barge. I went to the barge, Chapman and Saw were in the barge. I observed hay in the barge; the hay corresponded with mine. There were tares in my hay, and tares with the hay in the barge. I tracked the mark of a shoe all the way; the mark corresponded with Saw's shoe. The constable took them into custody; Chapman attempted to escape.

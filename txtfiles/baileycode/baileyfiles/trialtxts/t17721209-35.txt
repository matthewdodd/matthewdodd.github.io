            . The prisoner met me in St. James's park


 on the 4th of December, in the evening; she said, my dear will you take a walk with me upon the grass? I consented and lay with her there: after the affair was over, she wanted to go away in a clandestine manner, which struck me; I put my hand in my pocket and missed my money, two guineas and two half guineas, wrapped up in a piece of paper; I charged her directly with robbing me; she shrieked out, and two girls came to her assistance and endeavoured to pull her from me, but I held her fast, and took her to Sir

            's; I have a wife and two children to my shame; I was obliged to break it out to my wife; she saw her before the justice; she said what Hetty are you this unfortunate girl that has robbed my husband? the prisoner replied, I am very sorry for it; I did not know it was your husband, but since it is so, you shall have your money again, and I heard her say she gave the money to one of the girls that endeavoured to pull her from me.

Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the money; he searched beyond decency, but did not find any of his money upon me; I have been only six weeks in London.

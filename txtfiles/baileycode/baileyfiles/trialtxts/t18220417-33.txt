            . I live in Gutter Lane. On the 11th of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Cornhill


, going home. I was tapped on the shoulder and told my handkerchief was taken. I found the prisoner in the custody of Mr. Mann, and my handkerchief on the ground; he was close behind me; he said he hoped I would not bring him into trouble, and denied it.

            . I am a Wine Merchant, and live in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury. I was in Cornhill, and saw Mr. Buckland. I also saw the prisoner with a companion; they were well dressed. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Mr. Buckland's pocket, and either drop it or put it to his companion. I seized him and the other whom I let go to tap the gentleman on the shoulder; his companion got off with the handkerchief kicking under his feet.

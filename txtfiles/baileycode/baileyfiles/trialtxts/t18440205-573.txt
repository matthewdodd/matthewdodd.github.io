FRANCIS MANSER
 (police-constable S 87.) On the 26th of Jan. I was on duty, in private clothes, in Camden-town, and saw the prisoner, in company with two others, in Camden Villas-road—I saw him go into several gates, up to several houses, and come out again, go down St. Paul's-terrace, and through different streets, till he came to the Albert-road—he went into several houses there, and at last went into the gate of No. 9—he remained in there about five minutes, then came out, and passed his companions, they taking no notice of him, which made me suspect he had something—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I put my hand into his pocket, and found these forks.

Prisoner. It was the other young man who was with you who put his hand into my pocket. Witness. No, he went after the others—they got away.






GEORGE VENN
. I am footman to George William Wainwright, of No. 9, Albert-road. On the morning of the 26th of Jan. I had some forks of his in my custody—about half-past one o'clock I left them in my pantry cupboard, to go up stairs, hearing the bell ring—there is a way from the garden to the pantry, down two, three, or four steps—I was not absent more than five minutes—I then went down to the pantry, but did not miss the plate till the policeman came with it in his hand—these are the forks—they are my master's.





SARAH PUTT
. I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 26th of Jan. I saw the policeman come to the house with the prisoner—he produced these forks to me, which are my master's.

Prisoner. I beg for mercy.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.


Fourth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

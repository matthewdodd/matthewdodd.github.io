                  Robert 
                  Tailor 
               



            . I was in liquor down in Chick-lane, and the Prisoner Haines pick'd me up and took me to a place where I had 3 or 4 quarterns of gin, and afterward she follow'd me to my room at my master's Mr. Downer's the Greyhound in Smithfield



. I had that day received 28 l. and a crown for my master, and I am positive I had it safe, for before I went to bed I lock'd it up in a closet in my room, and put the key into my pocket. The Prisoner did not go to bed with me, and I being over-charg'd with liquor fell asleep presently, and when I 'wak'd my money was gone and she too. I made enquiry after the Prisoner Haines, and the Prisoner Gibbs gave me ten guineas of my money again, upon condition that I should not prosecute; and she told me she had it of the other Prisoner Haines.
Pris. Gibbs. Did he ever see me before I brought him the ten guineas?
Tailor. Yes; I don't say she was with me when I was robb'd, but she was with me at the house where I was drinking gin. I was robb'd on the sunday night, and on the monday the ten guineas were brought to me.

                  Downes 
               



            . On the 5th of July, about 5 in the afternoon, I paid Tailor 28 l. 5 s. for my brother 
               
                  John 
                  Downes 
               



            , and on monday morning about 4 o'clock he call'd me out of bed, and told me he had been robb'd. I made what enquiry I could, and found out the Prisoner Gibbs, who said she would get me ten guineas of my money again if I would give her a note not to prosecute her, and accordingly I did, and she went out, and fetch'd ten guineas wrapp'd up in a rag. She put it on the table, and told me I must take it up, for she would not give it me, and that it was part of the money that Haines took from this fellow. She said, she lay drunk on a bed in the place where it was taken, but she would not tell me where. On the saturday following we took Haines, and she confess'd that she knew Tailor very well, that he had been with her before, and that she robb'd him of 21 guineas and a 36 s. piece. I ask'd her what she had done with the money, and she told me she had given it to 
               
                  Suky 
                  Gray 
               



            , (the woman of the house) who gave her only one guinea of it for herself.

            . I was in search of the Prisoners, and came into the house just as Gibbs was paying the ten guineas. I took charge of her and the woman who kept the house, and she (Gibbs) said she knew nothing of the robbery, but that she had the money from the Prisoner Haines. I afterwards took Haines at Clerkenwell, and she confess'd to me that she pick'd Tailor's pocket of his money while he was asleep at a house in Thatch'd Alley, Chick-lane. She said she gave the money to Gibbs, and they both went down stairs, and gave it to her landlady, who gave her (Haines) a guinea for her trouble. That after this they put 21 s. in silver, a moidore, and a half guinea into the bag, and put it again into Tailor's pocket, the doing of which disturb'd and 'wak'd him.

            . I have nothing to say, only when

                  Gibbs 
               



             brought the money, she own'd she had it from Haines.
Pris. Haines. The Prosecutor always was with me as a husband, and has frequently left money with me to take care of: He left this money in my landlady's hands, and I never saw him till the monday sevennight following, and then he took me.
Gibbs. I never said I received the money: Tailor gave me this note, please to let it be read.
Tailor. This is Mr. Downes's writing, and this is my mark.

             deposed that as he was sitting in the coach at Guildhall


, while his master was attending the court of common-pleas, he observed his coat to move. He got out and catch'd the prisoner putting it into a bag, upon which he was secured.
The prisoner in his defence said, he was an Irishman
, and had been in London but a little time, that he was very sickly, had a very bad memory, and did not remember the coach, prosecutor, nor coat.

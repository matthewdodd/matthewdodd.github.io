            . I am servant to James Greig; he is a baker
. I was sitting in the parlour behind the shop, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and heard money chinking - I got up, and saw a boy
 run out with the till in his hand; I ran to the door, and called Stop thief! he set the till down four or five doors off, and ran away - the next witness brought him back; I had not seen his face -I saw no other boy; I saw him when the witness pursued him; the till was taken up, and brought to me - we could not tell whether any thing was missing from it.

            . I was standing opposite the prosecutor's and saw the prisoner run from the shop with the till; he set it down four doors off - I took him about eight doors further, without losing sight of him.

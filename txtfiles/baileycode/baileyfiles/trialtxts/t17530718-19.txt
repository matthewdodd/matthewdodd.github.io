            . I live in Old-street; I saw the prisoner at the bar pick the pocket of Mr. Holmes; I saw him put his hand in and take this handkerchief out. (He produces the handkerchief). I took hold on him and said you have got the gentleman's handkerchief, then he run away, I run after him and was some time before I catch'd him; I search'd him and found seven handkerchiefs upon him, which I deliver'd to the officer.

            . The prisoner was brought to me by the last witness; he gave me charge of him. (He produces seven handkerchiefs). These handerchiefs were all given me by White, in the presence of the prisoner. We took him before the justice, and there he own'd they came from him, but that another person took them, and gave them to him.

It was in holiday-time, and I was in liquor; I am quite innocent of it as the child unborn.

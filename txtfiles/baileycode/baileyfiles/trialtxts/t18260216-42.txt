THOMAS MITCHELL. I am in partnership with James Mitchell and John Chandler - we have a stable in Millbank-street, Westminster


. On Sunday, the 18th of December, about two o'clock, I hung a gig harness in the stable; I left the door latched, but not locked - a little before eleven o'clock that night I was called on by two patrol, who asked if I had lost any harness - I then went to the stable, and missed it - the door was in the same state as I had left it. I found the harness at the watch-house.

I was on duty in Vine-street on the 18th of December, with two officers, and met the prisoner, whom I knew before, with a sack on his back - I detained him, and found in the sack this set of gig harness, complete; he said a man had given it to him, but could not tell who the man was.

1545. 




DENNIS M'CARTHY
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



John Crockett, from his person.






HENRY DAVIS
 (police-constable E 25). On the 10th of May I was on duty in Holborn, between Southampton-street and Museum-street—I saw the prisoner following Mr. Crockett—I watched for some time, and saw him lift the skirt of his coat, take a handkerchief out, put it in his breast and run off—I crossed and took him with the handkerchief—there was a scuffle—I was knocked down by the mob, and the handkerchief dragged from me—Mr. Crockett had claimed it in the prisoner's hearing—he begged him to let him go and said he would not do so again—I took him to the watch-house—it was a silk handkerchief, red and coloured.

Prisoner. The gentleman said, "Let him go, he has done nothing." Witness. Nobody said so in my hearing.





JOHN CROCKETT
. I live in High Holborn, and am a pawnbroker. On the evening of the 5th of May, about seven o'clock, I was in Holborn—I called, and saw the policeman holding the prisoner—I saw my handkerchief in

the prisoner's hand—it was silk, a red border and stone-coloured middle, with spots—I am certain it was mine—the prisoner went on his knees, and begged me to let him go—I had Mrs. Crockett waiting for me—a mob collected—I was glad to get away—it was safe when I left my house, which was thirty yards off.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell the policeman to let me go? A. No—I said I did not want the bother, and had rather let him go—I did not say he had done nothing.

Prisoner. I was taken to the station, and there was no owner for the property, but next day this person came—there was plenty of time for the policeman to get somebody to claim it.




GUILTY.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(The prisoner had only been liberated five days from an imprisonment of twelve months for a similar offence.)

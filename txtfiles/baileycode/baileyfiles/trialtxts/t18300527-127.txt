. The prisoner, her father, and sister, all lodged in the first floor; the prisoner was there when she was out of place - I lost my coat on the 15th of March, from the front parlour; the prisoner was then at home, but went to a situation next day - I found my coat at a pawnbroker's at Hoxton last Tuesday week.

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I heard the prosecutor say he had lost his coat; I spoke to the prisoner on the subject, but made her no promise - I asked if she took it; she said she did, and told me where she had pawned it, in the name of Lewis.

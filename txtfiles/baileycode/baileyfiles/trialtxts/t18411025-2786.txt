THOMAS LEWIS
 and the said 




JOHN BROWN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
21st of September, 1 brass cock, value 2s., the goods of 



Henry Cordell; and 1 brass cock, value 2s., the goods of 



James Walker.






ELIZABETH CORDELL
. I am the wife of Henry Cordell, we live in Newport-street, Lambeth. We missed a brass cock on the 21st of September—this now produced is a part of it, which I am able to swear to.





RACHEL WALKER
. I am the wife of James Walker. We missed a brass cock on the 21st of September—I had seen it safe on the 20th—this is it—I can swear to it.





WILLIAM MURRAY
 (police-constable L 84.) On the 21st of September, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners coming out of the gardens of the houses in Newport-street, Lambeth— Brown got over a wall, and made his escape—I followed Lewis over three or four gardens, till I got to the back of Mr. Gurney's brewhouse—I stopped there while an officer went and took him in a water-closet—a basket of lead pipes and cocks was found in the garden under the wall which I had seen both the prisoners on—these two cocks, which the prosecutors claims, were in the basket.


WILIIAM DAVEY (police-constable L 169.) I took Lewis, but found nothing on him.

Brown's Defence. I know nothing of it at all.

            . The prisoner's father was fellow 
servant


 with me in Mr. Fuller's brew-house. About the beginning of April I receiv'd my wages, part of which I sent home to my wife, and the rest I kept in my hat, which I lock'd up in my cupboard, and went out to drink. Upon my return, which was in about half an hour, I found the cupboard open, and my hat in the same place I left it, with three half-pence in it. I immediately suspected the prisoner, and took him before the Justice, where he confess'd that he saw me tell my money, and put it in my cupboard, that, when I was gone, he went and open'd the cupboard with a knife, and took out eleven shillings and twopence halfpenny ; and that he had spent all of it but half-a-crown, which he had given to his mother.

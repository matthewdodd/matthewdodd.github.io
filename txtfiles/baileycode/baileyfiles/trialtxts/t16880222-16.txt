                   a Jew
, on the 20th. of January
 last, at One of the Clock in the Night, and stealing thence three Holland Shirts, value 20 s. one pair of Holland Sleeves, value 5 s. one Holland Cap, value 12 s. one Gold Chain, value 40 s.
             The Evidence as to the Felony was plain upon them all; they were Seized the next Morning in the Fields, running away from the Officers; had Swords and Pistols about them, and one of them a Vizard; and it was deposed, that Spring pull'd some of the goods out of his Breeches when they were Seized: But the Burglary not appearing plainly against them, or that they were taken in the House, they were all three brought in 


               guilty of Felony only
            .

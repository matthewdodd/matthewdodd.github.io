EDWARD PHILLIPS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Charles Woods, from his person.






WILLIAM WARD
. On the 9th of November, I was at the corner of Sackville-street, Piccadilly, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Wood's coat pocket—Mr. Wood turned round, and collared him with she handkerchief.





CHARLES WOODS
. I live in Piccadilly. On the 9th of December I was looking at a print-shop, in Sackville-street, and felt an unusual sensation at my pocket—I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I turned round, and saw the prisoner's hand going into his left-hand pocket—I collared him, and said that he had something not belonging to him, which he denied—I insisted on looking into his pocket, and found my handkerchief in it.

Prisoner. I was looking at the prints—a boy chucked the handkerchief on a railing, and ran away—I took it up, and put it into my pocket—the gentleman immediately collared me—I will take my with I never look it out of his pocket—It is very false to say so.





WILLIAM WARD

re-examined. I had watched him and another all the way from Bond-street—they tried several gentleman's pockets before they came to the prosecutor; and they got one handkerchief half-way out of a gentleman's pocket—I saw him take the prosecutor's handkerchief.

Prisoner. I had not been down so far as Bond-street—I came from the Middlesex Hospital.





JOHN BALDWIN
 (police-constable C 103.) I received the prisoner in charge with the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

1935. 




GEORGE COOPER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of April, 2 moulds, value. 5l., the goods of 




Daniel Merritt, his master.






DANIEL MERRITT
. I am a modeller, living in Foley-street—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 6th of April I told him I had missed a great quantity of moulds—he said it was very strange—I discharged him—I went to his lodgings, and found these two moulds in the water-closet—they are mine—no other person in the house could have taken them. ANNE, BLAKE. I found these in the water-closet—I told the prisoner's mother he had been robbing his master—he denied it, and made his escape when the officer arrived at the house—I had seen these two moulds lying on the fire-place in the room where he lived.





CHARLES STANTON
. I live in Harper-street, Fitzroy-square. I saw the prisoner coming out of Roberts'-mews—he said, "Oh, Charley, I expect to get nailed"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I have been taking some moulds of my master."

Prisoner. It is perfectly false; he is not to be believed; he has been convicted two or three times in the last twelvemonth. Witness. I have been convicted once, and then his brother led me into it.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—



Transported for Seven Years. (The prosecutor stated his loss at upwards of 100l.)

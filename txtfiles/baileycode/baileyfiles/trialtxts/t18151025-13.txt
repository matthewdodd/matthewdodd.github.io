            , he is a linen draper
, and resides at 13, Aldgate High street, Whitechapel


. On the evening of the 23rd of September, a person passing by, told me a boy had stolen a piece of printed cotton from the door. I immediately ran out and caught the prisoner with the printed cotton under his coat; we brought him into the shop and there was a mob wanted to rescue him and get him out. At last

             the constable came and secured him.

            . I was sent for to the prosecutor's house, and when I came there, there was a great mob round the door. Some of them were saying,
"go it, go it, we will have him out." I went into the shop, and took the prisoner into custody, and going along with him to the watchhouse, I got most violently abused. Here is the cotton.
Matthew Harrison. That is my master's property.

            . The prisoner lived servant
 with me about six or seven days, and when she was gone we missed the handkerchiefs: she went away clandestinely.
Q. Where do you live?
Bird. I keep a publick house in Durham-Yard; we found one of the handkerchiefs pawned to a Pawnbroker at the corner of Half-Moon Court for 2 s. I took her up, and before Justice Cox she confessed she had stole them, and had pawn'd that, and sold the other to a soldier.

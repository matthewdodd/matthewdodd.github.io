            . On the 29th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the taproom, and heard the bell ring up stairs, which rings when the door is opened. I went up with the servant, found the prisoner in the room, behind the door, and asked what brought him there? he said he was looking for his comrade; I said he had no business in the bed-room, and brought him down stairs - he pulled the waistcoat from under his jacket. I said he had something else, he then pulled the handkerchief out.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

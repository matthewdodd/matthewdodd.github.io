             sworn.
I am butler to Mr. Atkinson, the prisoner was a washerwoman
 that came to wash, I missed a great many pair of silk stockings of Mr. Atkinson's, I went into the laundry and enquired of the laundry-maid how many pair she had, I then went and looked into the drawer, and I missed a dozen and a half pair of silk stockings, I acquainted Mr. Atkinson with it when he came home, he said as to his handkerchiefs he might lose them when at the opera, but as to stockings he said he could not lose them off his legs, I speak to my own knowledge of the stockings, and handkerchiefs, and knives and forks, I lost three or four dozen, there was a servant maid that lived as cook, she went away and went to lodge with the prisoner.
Jury. I suppose a great many servants had access to these things? - I never locked them up; the servant gave some information and in consequence of that we got a search warrant, we examined the prisoner's house, and found half a dozen table knives and forks, I cannot say how many pair of silk stockings, there were some pairs and some odd ones; we found one pair loose at one side of the room, and others were found in a cupboard tied up in a diaper napkin, the knives and forks and stockings were all tied up in that towel, the prisoner was present, she said, she hoped I would be merciful to her.
Prisoner's Council. You took good care I understand of your master's things, for you never locked them up? - Never but when he was out of town.
All the servants had access to them? - Every one.
One of them I think you said lodged with this prisoner? - Yes.
I believe the prisoner was employed to do any thing at your house? - I cannot say what.
Nor whether this young woman or any of the maids took them you do not know? - No.
All you know is finding them at her house? - Yes.
And one of the maids lodged at the house? - Yes.
You and she did not perfectly agree before this time, she did not like you quite so well as you could wish? - I always behaved civil, I think she had no reason to dislike me.
I know that you was kind but she was cruel; did the other servants visit her, or their other fellow servants? - I do not know.

             sworn.
I am one of the marshalmen, we found several things at the prisoner's, and others at Worthy's and Jones's the pawnbrokers.
(The things deposed to by Hogg, except the knives and forks, which he cannot swear to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
The cook lodged with me at my lodgings, and brought a great many things while I was out at work.
- WORTHY sworn.
I am a pawnbroker, the things I produce the prisoner brought to me, I did not doubt but they were her own or her husband's, I knew she was a married woman.
Did the prisoner say these stockings were her own? - Yes.
Jury. Did she ever pawn any thing and take it out again? - Frequently, these things had been frequently with me.
Prisoner's Council. She did not come in any feigned name? - No, by no means.
To Hogg. You never marked any of them did you? - There is No. 5.
Who used to wash those stockings? - They were washed in the house.
Prisoner's Council to Worthy. These were pawned publickly? - Openly.
Jury. Could you believe that a woman in her situation of life, or her husband, wore such things? - I did not know she was a washerwoman till now.
What is her husband? - I do not know.
Prisoner's Council to Hogg. Did not the laundry-maid and the chamber-maid take care of the stockings? - I believe they did.
Are they here any of them? - They never missed them till I did.
The prisoner called four witnesses who all gave her a very good character.

Jury. Was the prisoner ever intrusted by the servants, with goods to her own house, to wash and mend? - Not to my knowledge.

            . I am a private watchman. About half-past seven o'clock at night, I heard a noise on the top of this house, and saw a man there. I got a light and went up a ladder, he jumped through the window, I followed him down to the first floor, and there took him, it was the prisoner. I found the lead on the roof unfixed and removed, but not taken away.

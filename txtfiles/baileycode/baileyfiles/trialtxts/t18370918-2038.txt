JAMES KINGSTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of August, 1 pair of boots, value 4s., the goods of 



Thomas George Cox.






THOMAS GEORGE> Cox. I live at Old Brentford. On the 19th of August I was in my shop, engaged with customers, and between nine and ten o'clock my son observed two or three of the men go out of the shop—he went out and followed them—he returned and gave me information—I

went after them myself, and overtook the prisoner, and found my boots on him—they had been in the shop—he was placing them under his smock frock—I took him and brought him into the shop—he said one Snowball had taken them and given them to him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Brentford and met a fellow workman, who asked if I was going home—I said I was—he gave me the shoes and asked me to take them home to my lodging till morning, when he would fetch them—we stood talking a few minutes, when this man came and caught hold of me—I asked the man who gave them to me, if he did not buy them of Cox, and he said he did.

MR. COX
re-examined, I let him go out to find this man—he went to a man and asked him, and he said he did buy them—I said, "Then come into the shop and we will settle it;" but he absconded—I saw the prisoner in the shop—he came in with four or five more, and three of them went out.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

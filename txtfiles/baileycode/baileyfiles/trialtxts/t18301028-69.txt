            . I live with Mr. David Watts, who keeps the Pontefract Castle public-house, at the corner of Chapel-street, New-road




. On the 16th of October I saw the prisoner take two pots from the table in a box in the front garden - I pursued him, but could not overtake him till he got to his own door - I then seized him, and felt a pot in his pocket; I called for an officer, but some personsin the house came and rescued him - the Policeman came and took him; the prisoner had been there before, and my master accused him one night of taking a quart pot.

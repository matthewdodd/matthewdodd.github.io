            . The prisoner was my servant
. When I went out, about eleven o'clock on the 1st of December, the things were in the house. A neighbour of mine, Mrs. Jordan, called and told me such things had been brought to her house; they were produced to me; I knew them to be mine. (The things produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I am the wife of the former witness; the things were kept in a drawer in our house; when we went out, about eleven o'clock, they were all there; Mrs. Jordan came to me to tell me she had stopped these things upon the prisoner.
Mrs. Jordan. The prisoner brought these things to me; she said she was going into the country, and wanted me to keep them for her; I suspected there was something wrong; I thought there might be some quarrel between her and her mistress; I went to her mistress's house, and gave them notice of it.
Prisoner's Defence.
The woman came and asked for these things; I thought she was the washer woman.

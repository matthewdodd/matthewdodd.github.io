PHILIP HILL.
I live in Smithfield. On the 15th of June, I was at the bottom of Holborn-hill, and felt something at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner running—I missed my handkerchief, and followed him—gave an alarm—I headed him at Fetter-lane, he turned back and went to Farringdon-street, where I took him—my handkerchief was found at the feet of one of the witnesses—this is it (looking at it.)





JAMES FLAVIN.
I am a sawyer, and live on Saffron-hill. The prisoner ran, and I saw him throw down the handkerchief—I took it up and gave it the officer.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it.




GUILTY.*—Aged 16.

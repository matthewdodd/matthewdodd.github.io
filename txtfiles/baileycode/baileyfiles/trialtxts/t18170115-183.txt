ABEL BURCHALL. I live with Messrs. Trueman and Co., brewers. On the 7th of December, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the two prisoners at a public-house, in Brick-lane


. Roberts came and sat down by me, on my left side. I told her I did not want to say any thing to her. She drank my beer without my leave. The other prisoner was in the room. My money was in my left hand breeches pocket. I had sixteen shillings and a three shilling bank token. I saw her hand come from my pocket, and she ran out of the box; I ran out and took hold of her. Crew came up, and took the money out of her hand, before I could lay hold of it, she ran into the tap-room, and gave it to somebody else. I brought the prisoner, Roberts, into the house, and gave her into custody. Crew was also searched, but nothing found on her. The prisoners appeared to be acquainted with several in the room. My pocket was drawn out.

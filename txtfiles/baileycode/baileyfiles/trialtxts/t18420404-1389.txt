JOHN KNOTT
. I am a painter, and live in the Broadway, Deptford. On the 30th of March, about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning, I was in New Cross-road, in the parish of St. Paul's, Deptford—I met the three prisoners—they all three passed me, and then Merry returned, and said, "My dear, where are you going?"—I said, "I am going home"—she said, "You had better go along with me"—I said, "Be off about your busmen, I have nothing to say to you"—the prisoner Jones came behind me, and raised the tail of my coat pocket—I said,"There is nothing at all there, be off about your business"—they followed me down the road, about sixty or seventy yards—when they found I would have nothing to do with them, Merry put her hand into my left trowsers' pocket—Jones put her hand into my right-hand pocket—I had a tobacco-box in my left-hand pocket, and in my right 6d., and at least three penny-pieces, two or three halfpence, and two farthings—I hollooed out "Police," and then the prisoner Lockett came up, and struck me over the ear, and knocked me down—it was a very severe blow, and he made an attempt at my watch—I happened to have my chain round my brace, and with pulling it he could not get my watch out of my pocket—some people were coming along, one of whom, Mr. Bond, I knew—I said, "Mr. Bond, is that you?"—he said, "What is the matter?" I said, "These people have been robbing me"—he said, "Which is it?"—I said, "All of them have tried, and two of them have robbed me"—Lockett made a kick at Bond, and I believe Bond struck him—a policeman came up, and after that I missed my tobacco-box, 6d., the three penny-pieces and the two farthings from my two pockets—I gave them all three into the custody of the policeman—my tobacco-box was produced at the station.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. This was on the night of Green-which fair, was it not? A. Yes, I had been at the Five Bells public-house, Kent-road, where there was a dance—I was going down to Deptford when I met them—I had been drinking—Bond had not been with me—I had not seen him for above twelve months—I did not see him strike one of the women—I was near him—I will swear he did not strike one of them—we had had two pints of porter, and three glasses of gin-and-water between three of us—that was between half-past seven and two o'clock—the prisoners were altogether when they passed me, going in a contrary way, coming up from Greenwich—they passed me, and then turned back—Lockett did not interfere till I refused to go with the young women—they followed me sixty or seventy yards—he must have been close behind—as soon as hollooed out "Police," he knocked me down—after the woman took my money and box out, I called out "Police," and Lockett came up, struck me, and knocked me down—he struck me at the side of my ear—I could see him, for he came right on the side of me to do so, he came from behind

Bond is a plasterer—I do not know whether he is a fighting man—he is a strong, stout man.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. This part of the road is not very well lighted, is it? A. Yes, there are gas-lights in the road—they are some distance from each other—I am certain it was Merry that spoke to me—when they first passed me they did not speak at all—I walked several yards and she came up by herself at that time—I told her be off, and then Jones came up—I said nothing to Jones till I said there was nothing there, meaning in my pocket, when she put her hand in—as soon as one's hand was out of my pocket the other put her's in—I had two half-crowns in my waistcoat pocket, that I did not lose—when I first met them there was a tallish man about twenty yards a-head of them—there were not a number of people coming from Greenwich—I did not meet a soul till Bond came up—the prisoners appeared all together—I paid particular attention to them—they were closer together than they are now—I cannot say they were talking together—I saw them before they came up to me—they were walking together, and came back after me.





CHARLES HEATH BOND
. I am a plasterer, and live at Peckham. On the 30th of March I was in the New Cross-road, coming from Blackheath—I heard Mr. Knott call out "Police"—I went up to him directly, and saw the two female prisoners with him—the prisoner Lockett was there, and he struck Knott—that was after the cry of police—I went op to Mr. Knott, and Lockett pulled off his coat and said, "What do you want, I will fight you"—I said, "I don't want any of your fighting"—he directly up with his foot and kicked me in the * * *—I immediately collared him—he directly took a box out of his pocket, and chucked over the hedge—I said, "There goes something he has taken out of his pocket"—the policeman immediately came up—I told the policeman he had chucked something over the hedge—he gave me his lantern, and I went through the hedge, and a young lad with me, who picked up the tobacco-box in my presence, in Mr. Emmett's field—they were taken to the station—before the box was found I struck Jones, as she pulled her bonnet off and came and struck at me as if to scratch me—my nose has been sore ever since—she cut me inside the nose with her fist—she was taking the part of Lockett who had kicked me—when I struck him, she struck me.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What are you? A. A plasterer, a task master—I take contracts from builders—I told the Magistrate about Lockett kicking me—what I said was read over to me—I put my mark to it—this is it. (The witness's deposition being read, stated, "I went up, saw two young women, some words are, I struck Jones, Lockett then came up, struck me, & c.")—Lockett kicked me before the girl touched me—I did not tell the Magistrate about her making my nose sore—I did not think of it—I told him she struck me, but I did not say it was on my nose—I had only had three pints of porter all day—I had been over to a gentleman on the heath, who was very ill—I was coiming from Blackheath—I had not been near the fair—I am not a fighter—I have been in scuffles at public houses, but never in a regular fight—I struck Lockett after he kicked me—I never struck him on the collar-bone—I believe it was somewhere in the face—he ran behind a cab, and fell down on the path of his own accord, and hurt his collar-bone—he did not fall from my blow, but stood afterwards and struck at me—I told him I did not wish to hurt him, but to give him in charge—I did not strike him 11 he kicked me.


Jones. Q. Who was it called the police? A. Mr. Knott. Jones. No, it was me—I received a blow and a kick and called the police—you kicked me yourself, and told me next day if I said nothing about that, you would say nothing against me. Witness. It is not true—I never saw you till I came up.

MR. PAYNE. Q. You say when you came up Lockett struck Knott, what was the effect of that blow? A. He struck him on the ear-he might have struck him before for what I know—there was one or two person in the road.





WILLIAM KING
 (police-constable R 205.) On the 30th of March I was on the New Cross-road, and noticed a disturbance—I went up—Knott gave Lockett in custody—I received a tobacco-box from a boy, who went over the hedge with Bond, to whom I lent my lantern—I took Lockett to the station, searched him, found a sovereign, a half-crown, and one shil—in his stocking, and 2s. 10 1/4 d. in his pocket, and two handkerchiefs—one farthing was very black on one side, and worn more bright on the other, it had not been described to me before I found it on him, but before it was shown to Knott he described it to me—I did not find a sixpence on him—the women followed him to the station and were then taken into custody—Knott did not say that they had anything to do with it till he got to the station—he then told me how it occurred—he said Lockett had attempted to take his watch, and he had lost his tobacco-box.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. The women followed after you quietly enough, they never offered to run away? A. No.

COURT. Q. What did you notice before you got up to them? A. I heard a noise, and something like a cry of "Police," and a disturbance—I ran down the road, and Knott said, "I give this young man in charge, he has knocked me down, and they have robbed me"—the women were by at the time, all in the affray—the prosecutor owned the tobacco-box—it was given him by the boy—he came through the hedge with it.





JOHN KNOTT
 (re-examined.) I will swear to this farthing being the one I lost—I had had it in my pocket on Monday and Tuesday—I brought it from home—I took it for some beer at the Druid's Head, and had it in my pocket ever since Monday—this was Wednesday morning.
(Lockett received a good character.)

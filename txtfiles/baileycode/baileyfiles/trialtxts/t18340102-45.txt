HARRIETT SALTER. I am a widow
 - these sugar-tongs are mine - they were in a cupboard in the room I lodged in, in Derby-street


 - the room was then to let - the prisoner knocked on 18th December, and asked to look at the room - he came up stairs with the landlady - the prisoner said he liked the room; but there was a cupboard in it which he should like to have removed, to put some shelves up - he opened the cupboard-door and looked in; and I saw through the crack that he put his hand on something in the cupboard - he said he was afraid the cupboard was not deep enough; but he would send his mistress to look at it - I saw him put his hand to his pocket, and he went down - I went to the cupboard and missed the tongs - I called to the landlady to stop him, as I had been robbed of a pair of sugar-tongs - the prisoner said, "Nonsense; they are there;" and he ran up to my room again, and was going to the cupboard - I said, "Give me leave to go to my own cupboard" - I opened the door, and said, "You see they arenot there; they are in your hand" - he said, "Here, take them, and say nothing."
WILLIAM BARTLETT (police-constable C 149). I took the prisoner.

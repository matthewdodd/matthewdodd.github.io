ELLEN PRICE
. I am the wife of James Price, a tailor, lodging in Caroline court, Saffron-hill. The prisoner and his wife lived in the same house—I remember seeing the prisoner in his room in bed, in August last—his wife got the dinner ready, and afterwards called to him—he told her to get it ready and she did, and when it was ready he told her to bring it into the room and he would eat it in bed—she did so—he was eating his dinner, and there was some words between them—she wanted him to get up to dinner, and he would not—he rose up the knife to strike her—she rose her hand up to save her face, and received the knife in her wrist—he was eating his dinner with the knife in his hand—it was a very small cut, but it bled very severely, just on the wrist—he struck her more than once there, but not with the knife—she afterwards left the room and went into the other room—he got out of bed, followed her, and struck her over the eye, which gave her a black eye, and cut her eyebrow—he struck her with his fist—she was sitting down when he struck her, and she fell off the chair from the blow, into the corner of the room—he put one of his hands on her mouth, took her by the hair of her head with the other hand, raised her head up by the hair, and knocked it down against the floor—he was two or three minutes beating her on the floor, and kneeling on her stomach—she screamed dreadfully before he put his hand on her mouth—he had his hand round her throat—I do not know whether he was pressing or pinching it, but I saw his hands round her throat—she screamed dread fully before that, but that prevented her calling out—she got up and made towards the window to open it, and broke a pane of glass—he then took hold of her round her waist, threw her down in the corner of the room, and

got her to go into the other room—her gown was all over blood, and he got the gown off her—he laid her on the bed, and took it off himself over her head by great force—nothing else took place that night, that I know of—I saw them next morning, they were up in the room—they both got up before me in the morning, and she told me something, but he was not present—I did not see him do anything to her that morning—he was two or three seconds kneeling on her chest—she appeared distressed about it—she complained of being very bad in her right side, that there was something prevented her drawing her breath—she was able to use her right arm; but the morning before she died, she could not lift her child out of bed, and asked me to do it for her—this was on the Tuesday morning, a week after the treatment happening, and she died that night—she appeared in a bad state all the time till she died—I saw her every evening when I came in from work—she did not keep her bed, but appeared ill—I returned to the house on Tuesday evening, the 15th, and saw her dead.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see the prisoner then? A. Yes—he did not appear to be sorry to me—he seemed to keep it very silent, and let nobody know of it—about two hours after I went into the room, he came into the other room, and said it was a queer thing, and that he was very sorry—he did not have much to say to any of us—he did appear in sorrow, but he seemed very silent—they had lived together comfortably in general, from what I saw—I cannot tell whether he struck her with the knife on purpose, or by accident—I do not know whether it was intentionally done—she was speaking to him and provoked him a little, and he took up the knife with his hand, he intended to strike her in the face, but she received the blow in the wrist—I knew nothing of them, only while they lodged there, which was going on for three months—I saw some blood on her face—I wished to wash her face and bind the wound up, but she was not willing to have it bound up—he wanted her to take her gown off and have another on, but she wanted to go out with that gown on, to have him taken up.

MR. JONES. Q. Did you ever know them quarrel before? A. No—I did not know at that time whether she bled from any other part than the wrist—the blood on the face came from the eyebrow—it bled a little—that was done from a blow of his fist.





HANNAH CONNOR
. In August I lived in the same court with these people—I have known them about five months—on Sunday, the 6th of August, I saw them quarrelling, about two or three o'clock—I saw the prisoner hitting her, and give her a blow on the forehead with his fist—he gave her tow or three blows, and she fell on the floor—I saw him kicking her on her legs—that was on Monday, the 14th of August, the day before she died—he was going to work at six o'clock in the morning—it was at their own house—I was at my window, with my baby in my arms—I heard the woman scream, and raised up the window—she said, "Bad luck to you, you have done me now for ever"—he turned back, and said, "Don't give me a bad wish on Monday morning," and he kicked her in her leg—she screamed and hollooed, and called my name—I came down and gave her a light—he pulled her into the passage, and then into the room, and then she screamed out again—he locked the door, and would not let anybody in—I was in my shift and flannel petticoat—he went away—they were both inside the room when he locked the door, and she was screaming out—I stopped in my passage, and saw him go out to work—she then came out and sat down on her step, and began to cry—I went over

to her, and she threw up blood—that was not five minutes after he was gone—she could hardly speak to me when she threw the blood up—she showed roe marks on her body—all her flesh was blue from kicking and pinching—both her legs, and near her ribs, and her shoulders—she appeared to be very bad—while they were in the room together, I heard her say to him, before she said, "Bad luck, &c.," that he had put his five fingers in her throat, and knelt on her chest, and had done her up for ever—she said that to him—the next day, which was the day she died, she sent me out for a half quartern of wine in the afternoon, and told me to put a little drop of hot water to it, which I did, and gave it to her, but she could not swallow it—she then appeared very ill, and threw up blood again when I gave her the drink—she asked me if I would bring the Priest to her—I said I could not, I had two children ill with the measles, and could not go—one of her lodgers came in, and she cried out again," Fetch me the clergyman"—she said she was dying, and she could not swallow—she told me she got the injuries from her husband.

Q. You have been speaking of the 14th of August? A. It was Monday—I remember seeing her on the Sunday, the 6th, and she was bleeding at that time—I saw her from twelve o'clock till two o'clock that day—he beat her like a bullock—she had a cut in her wrist that day, and he gave her a blow on her forehead—he was ill-using her from twelve till two o'clock—I do not know whether he was in bed—a mob was about the house, and he shut the window and the door up, and would not let any body in—I could not see into the room—I saw the blood and saw her bleed—her gown was full of blood.

Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you to say, on the Sunday week before she died you did not see any thing, because—hefastened the door? A. Yes—I looked through the window, and saw her bleeding like a bullock—there was nobody in the room then, that I saw, but him and her; but I could not see, for he pulled the blind down—I saw her gown torn to pieces—I went before the Coroner—I do not know whether they lived quietly together before this—I used to see them quarrelling and fighting—that was always the plan when I used to see them—when I was before the Coroner every body was talking, and I had a baby in my arms, so that I could not listen to my deposition, which was read over to me—my baby was crying—I was listening to it, but could not hear half of it—I put my cross to the paper—I cannot tell whether that paper was read over to me—I am not a scholar—I do not know my mark again—there are many marks as well as mine—it is out of my power to look at this—I cannot read nor write—I am sure I cannot tell whether this cross is mine—I do not know whether this is it or not—(the deposition being read, the wit ness stated in it, she had known the deceased for twelve months, and she and her husband lived quietly together up to last Sunday week, and that she never saw him strike her, except by kicking her on the knee, and that not to hurt her.)

Q. Have you heard what you swore there, you never saw the man kick her, except just to kick her on the knee, and not to hurt her—is that true or not? A. I said I did not see him striking her on that Monday morning, and that is true.

COURT. Q. You said you saw her on Sunday the 6th, and he struck her in the eye, and her gown was all over blood? A. I did not say he struck her in the eye, but I saw her bleed.

MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you mean to swear, after having said before

the Coroner that you never saw him strike her, except a kick on the knee, and that not to hurt her, that you saw him repeatedly strike her, and ill use her in every possible way? A. Well, I will say that still—I am sure I did not say before the Coroner that they lived together quietly—I said I did not know the people only about three or four months—I heard this read over to me—I did not swear it, that I know of—when I saw them they were always quarrelling and fighting.

COURT. Q. Had you seen them quarrelling and fighting before Sunday the 6th, because you said you had known them twelve months, and they lived quietly together till last Sunday week? A. I did not say twelve months, because they were not in the house so long—I did not say so be fore the Coroner—they have put it down wrong.

MR. JONES. Q. Is what you have said to-day true? A. It is.





CORNELIUS CARTY
. I lodged in Caroline-court, in the same house as the prisoner and his wife, for one week. I went there on Tuesday night, one week before she died—I saw nothing in the least unpleasant between them while I lived there—I went out early in the morning to work, and saw nothing—I was at home the day she died—there was nothing the matter with her health, that I know of, when I went there—she was grumbling about something or other—she was not ill, that I noticed of—she had a black eye when I went there, and there was a little cut on the eye brow—I do not know how that came there—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—they might quarrel sometimes—I was at home on Sunday the day before his wife died—I was in bed when he went to work—I got out of bed about nine o'clock—she then said she was very poorly—she was not in bed then—she was about the house—she died on Tuesday night—(I was before the Coroner)—when I came home on Sunday night they were quiet—I sat on a chair, and sent out for a pot of beer—five of us drank it—Mr. Farrell borrowed 1s. of the prisoner, and he told his wife to go out for half a gallon of beer—his wife took the shilling, and walked out with another woman for the beer—Mrs. Hennessey did not come back, and Mrs. Farrell told the prisoner that his wife had taken 6d. out of the 1s.—he said, "Where is she"—she said she went down the hill for some snuff—she came in afterwards, and he asked what she took the 6d. for—she said she took no 6d.—he said, "Yes, you did, and you shall give it back"—he shut the door, and banged her in—she up with the pot, and threw it over me and another man—he caught hold of her, and threw her against the bed—he took something like a small handkerchief from her, he up with his fist and struck her three or four strokes with his fist on her head—that was the Sun day night before she died—I told him twenty times to behave himself—he took away the 6d., and went out of the room—when I saw her on Monday morning she complained of being poorly, and said her chest was sore—I walked out directly I spoke to her—when I came in to breakfast I said, "You had better go to the doctor's, and get bled," and it seems she went—the doctor came in the evening, and she was not in-doors—I advised her to have medical assistance, because she was grumbling and growling—the doctor met her as he went out, and returned with her and bled her.





JOHN BREDALL
. I am assistant to Addington and Gibson, surgeons. I saw Mrs. Hennessey on the Monday before she died—that was the first time I recollect seeing her—she complained of great pain in the chest and difficulty in breathing—she appeared to be suffering in that way—she pointed to just below the right breast—I examined her—there appeared an extensive inflammation in the chest—I desired her to go home and go to bed,

and I said would mention it to one of the principals, and either Mr. Gibson or myself would attend to her—I mentioned it to Mr. Gibson, and then went to her, and bled her to about fourteen ounces, and administered the usual remedies to abate the inflammation—she appeared to be very ill—I saw her next morning—she said she was in less pain than the day before—the bleeding would account for that—she appeared still very ill, and died in the evening—I was present at the opening of the body—I saw the chest examined—it bore every appearance of a high state of inflammation—the whole contents of the chest were more or less inflamed, and the right side more particularly—both right and left were inflamed—on removing the integuments there was the mark of an old contusion, and some effused blood in the cellular membrane of the throat, extravasated blood—that might be caused by external blows or injury of some sort—kneeling on the chest would be likely to create inflammation there—that would be highly probable—I do not think that inflammation was connected with pressure on the throat—I think the inflammation of the chest caused her death—there was also a broken rib—it appeared to me to have been broken before, a new structure had grown up, and been again broken before the union was perfect.

Cross-examined. Q. Did the fractured rib produce the inflammation in the chest? A. I cannot exactly say.

COURT. Q. The rib though fractured presented no rough substance that could have penetrated the lungs? A. No—there was no displacement of parts—the internal bleeding could not proceed from the broken rib.

MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was there not an internal adherence of the lungs to the pleura? A. Yes. I have heard she had been very much affected with influenza—very serious disease of the lungs has followed influenza—the adhesion was on the left side, not the side the broken rib was.

COURT. Q. Do you suppose the adhesion of the pleura to have been of long standing? A. Yes, that might render her more susceptible of injury.





JOHN ROWLAND GIBSON
. I am a surgeon, and live in Holborn. I at tended Mrs. Hennessey for influenza about three weeks before her death, from which she had perfectly recovered before her death—I saw her on the 15th, and found her suffering from inflammation of the chest and throat—I observed a blackness about the right eye—it had been cut—there was the remains of a wound just above it—it appeared to have been inflicted about a week previous—I gave her advice and some medicine—on the Thursday after her death I examined the body—on examining superficially the parts of the body I found no marks of violence about the head, but on dissecting the scalp from the brain, there was extravasated blood between the scalp and the brain—I should ascribe that to some external violence received, and from the appearance of some spots, they were of different dates—on dissecting the integuments from the chest there was some extravasated blood on the right side of the throat, and likewise some on the chest—on examining the chest I found that the fifth rib was fractured about two inches distant from its union with the cartilage—on opening the chest, the lining of the membrane on the right side was in a state of inflammation—the lungs were likewise inflamed, and of a darker colour than they should be—the air tubes leading from the lungs were in a state of inflammation, which appeared to spread along the whole of the their ramifications till it terminated at the corner of the mouth—those appearances were quite sufficient to account for the death of the woman—there were no marks of violence on the body, except those I have mentioned on the eye and eyebrow—on dissecting the integuments there were marks of violence on the right side,

a little behind the seat of fracture, behind the fractured rib—I think kneeling on the chest would most likely break the rib in the way in which we found it broken, but I think there must be some blow to account for the extravasated blood—I attribute her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I have heard the witnesses examined—I think the account they have given quite sufficient to account for the mischief I found, but I hardly think the fractured rib sufficient to produce the whole of the inflammation I found in the chest—I think blows might produce the inflammation—I have heard that several blows were given in the side, but that would not sufficiently account for the appearances I saw—it is a thing we do not meet with, to find such extensive inflammation arising from a single fracture of one rib.

Q. Supposing a person thrown down on the ground, struck with a fist in the side, and violence of that kind? A. If that had been the case, I should have found marks externally of such violence—I do not think they would wholly disappear after eight or nine days—I ascribe her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I think the fractured rib caused inflammation on the right side, because the inflammation round the seat of fracture was more intense than in other parts—I attribute the inflammation of the lungs to other causes, such as cold—she had perfectly recovered from influenza—I am not acquainted with any other natural cause to account for the inflammation—she appeared tolerably well in other respects, when I attended her for the influenza—the throwing up of blood would proceed from a ruptured vessel—it is not a common thing to proceed from external violence, and I do not think it is what we should look for—I hardly think that being knocked down and knelt, on or thrown violently down on the floor, would of itself be sufficient to rupture a vessel.

Cross-examined. Q. Would not the adhesion of the lungs to the pleura convince you that she was a person with great tendency to some disease of that kind? A. It pointed out to me that there was a great disposition to inflammation—the existence of this adhesion, I think proved that she had had inflammation before, and therefore she might have a disposition to it again—I do not know that affections of the pleura have been very common lately—they are not uncommon certainly.

COURT. Q. We should be much obliged to you if you could tell us to what cause you ascribe the death of this woman, from natural causes, or inflammation arising from external violence? A. My belief is, that the fractured rib occurred some days before the inflammation in the chest—violence some days after might produce inflammation in the chest, and that inflammation might have been extended by other causes, but it was first occasioned by the fractured rib—I cannot give it as my opinion that external violence alone would produce such inflammation as I found, or that her death is wholly ascribable to external violence—I do not think we have any reason to suppose that inflammation would have occurred within the chest, had we not had the fractured rib in the first instance to cause it, and then, perhaps, by other causes, inflammation was extended, which terminated fatally.

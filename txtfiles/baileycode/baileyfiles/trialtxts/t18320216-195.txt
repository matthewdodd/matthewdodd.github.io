. I lost several bottles from my premises, and on the 19th of January I was watching with the constable, from about five o'clock in the evening till about nine - I then heard something, but as somebody came in with some horses at the time, I could not hear any thing more - I waited till they were gone, and then I heard some bottles move; I ran up, and found the prisoner with the bottles - they had been in a shed in my garden; he had only moved them about two yards from where he took them.

            . I am an officer. I was watching with the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner come into the premises alone - I heard the bottles chink; we went up, and took him - he fell down, and dropped the bottles.
Prisoner. I did it from distress.

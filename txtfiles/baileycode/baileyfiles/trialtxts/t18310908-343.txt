THOMAS BOYCE. I am a constable of Hampsted district. On the evening of the 6th of August I saw the prisoner in company with another boy go into Mosely's shop- the other boy took down a cage, which had white mice in it, and the prisoner took down a pair of skates - I pursued him, and took him to the watch-house; I found the skates on him.
Prisoner. The prosecutor took the value of the property, and here is the paper he signed for it.


                  THOMAS 
                  MOSELY
               



            . I have not been paid for them - I know nothing of this paper, and never saw it before; I did not sign this paper - I know nobody who lives in Tothill-street; as far as I am concerned this paper is a forgery altogether; the prisoner's friends came and offered me money to keep from here, but I refused it.


                  JOSEPH 
                  GATES
               



            . I am the prisoner's brother. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Mosely
               



             signed that paper, and took 2s. from me, being the full value of the property; he told me if I would give him 5s. to pay his expences to save him coming here, he would accept of it - he took 2s., and we spent 3s. in drink; I, him, and another friend.
THOMAS MOSELY. I never drank with this man in my life, or spent 3s. in his compary, nor received 2s. from him.


                  JOSEPH 
                  GATES
               



            . My friends are all gone home, or I could bring them up - they saw us drinking together,down by the Sessions'-house, I do not know the sign -Mr. Lewis, the prosecutor, and Mr. and Mrs. Mason were there.


                  FREDERICK 
                  HAYES
               



            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Chapel-street, Somers'-town. The prosecutor told me he had taken 2s. of this man - I did not write this paper; I saw it at the Northampton Arms, Pentonville - the prosecutor was there, drinking with Mr. Meares and two young men; Meares in a bird fancier, at Pentonville - I saw the paper in Lewis' hands; Lewis wrote the body of it, and Mosely put his name to it, but not in my presence.
Q. Look at this paper, is not the whole of it in one handwriting? A. I should not think the name was written by the same person - I was not present when it was written at all; the prosecutor told me he had received the 2s., and did not want to hurt the man.


                  JOSEPH 
                  GATES
               



            . We were drinking at the Northampton Arms, as well as at Clerkenwell - we met at the Sessions'-house, and drank; we finished at the Northampton Arms.

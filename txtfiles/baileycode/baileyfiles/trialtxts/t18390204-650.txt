ANN WHEATLEY
. I am a widow, and live in Upper Park-place, Dorset-square. On Thursday evening, the 10th of January, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner walking by the side of me opposite Trinity church, in the New-road—I was coming from Tottenham-court-road—I had my handkerchief up to my face—he asked if I had the toothache—I said, "No, Sir"—he then asked me if I had far to go—I said, "No, Sir"—he said would I take his arm—I said no, and spoke very cross—he took me by the arm, and took me through the Park gate, Park-square East, and behaved excessively ill, pulling my clothes about in a very improper way, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I am sure of that—I had four half-crowns, seven shillings, and sixpence there loose—when I could speak I charged him with taking my money out of my pocket—he swore a very bitter oath—a policeman directly after came up—I said, "Thank God, here is a policeman," and gave him in charge—before I saw

the policeman, I was so agitated that I could hardly speak, and did not see a person to call out to—I was very unwell and nervous—I do not believe he wanted any thing but to get my money—he had dragged me into the Park, and began pulling me about—I begged him to let me go—I did not see any body in the Park—I saw nobody to complain to till I saw the policeman—I am certain he got my money—he wanted to go away when I charged him with the robbery, but the policeman came up—he was getting away as the policeman came up—I dare say he had got my money ten or twenty yards before the policeman came up; and as soon as I saw the policeman I called out—I saw two females in the Park, but they were a great way off—I had counted my money, and had it in my pocket between Trinity church and Tottenham-court-road.





WILLIAM LLOYD
. I am a policeman. I was in the park on the night in question—I passed through Chester-gate about eight o'clock, and came towards Park-square East, on the Colosseum side—I there saw two persons standing under the park palings apparently hustling together—I watched them for about five minutes, and then heard a female voice cry out, "Let me go—let me go"—I crossed over at the time, and she said, "Thank God, here is a policeman"—I said, "What is the matter?"—she immediately replied, "I charge this man with having robbed me"—I said, "Of what?"—she said, "Of a quantity of silver"—I said, "What silver have you lost?"—she said, "Some half-crowns"—I turned to him and said, "You are charged with stealing half-crowns from this lady"—he said, "I have no such thing"—I said, "You must come to the station-house"—he slunk away about ten yards—I followed him and took him to the station-house, and there found five half-crowns, sixpence in silver, 11/2d. In coppers on him, and twelve duplicates.

JURY. Q. Did the female cry as if she was frightened? A. She did, and seemed very much agitated.

Prisoner's Defence (written.) "On Thursday, at a quarter-past six o'clock, turning out of Albany-street in the New-road, there were twenty or thirty persons round a drunken man, and as I was looking the prosecutrix said, 'What a shame,' to me—I asked her if she was a married woman—she said, 'No, thank God!'—we then walked to the next turning that leads to the Regent's-park from Albany-street—she said, 'Was I not ashamed to meet any one I knowed with an old woman of her age?"—I said, 'No woman was old that had the use of their limbs'—in the meantime she was turning into the second' turning in the park from Albany-street—we crossed the road to the private walk, as far as the turning that leads to the bridge—we were agoing into the middle circle—she said there was some one a looking—I saw it was a policeman—by that we turned back to the end, past the Diorama, took the turning nearly opposite Chester-gate, just by the middle circle, passed and repassed several people, but we made several stops till the people passed us in the middle circle—she said my hand was in her pocket—I said, 'Good God! what do you mean? have you lost any thing?'—she said, 'Yes'—I told her to be certain—she said, 'Never mind'—I asked her to take my arm, which she did—after this we passed three persons, and at the end turning to the outer circle we passed two females—she said, 'I hope no one has seen us'—I asked her if she would go and take a glass of any thing to drink—she said, 'Stop till we get into the New-road'—a few yards further a policeman was passing—she said, 'Are you a policeman? this man has robbed me'—he said to her, 'Are

you sure?'—she said, 'Yes'—he said I must go with him to the station-house—when there, she first said she had lost twelve shillings, then she said seventeen shillings—she said four half-crowns—the policeman took five half-crowns from me, and seven or eight shillings—she told me that she lived with her son before he was married—she told me that her husband was insane, before be died, for some years, and she had not known the comfort of a married life for some years before his death—she told me all this in the park—she had her hands in my trowsers, and when any one was passing she took them out—she never made any alarm that she had been robbed all the time, till we nearly got out of the park—said she had lived in the neighbourhood for the last thirty years, and swears that she did not know any of the turnings."





JOHN MAY
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the former conviction of the prisoner from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I know him to be the person—I was in court when he was convicted.

            . I am a salesman
 and silversmith
. On Monday the 27th of June, about eight in the evening, I took some things home to Oxford-road; when I returned I found the prisoner in custody in the shop, charged with stealing a petticoat; she begged me to forgive her as knowing her.

            . I am a grocer: I live opposite the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner go into his shop, take the petticoat, put it under her apron, and go out of the shop; I went and acquainted them of it; she was just crossed over the way.

            . Mr. Newton is my brother-in-law, I take care of his shop sometimes when he is absent; I took the prisoner with the petticoat upon her, on the information of the last witness. (The petticoat produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Q. Was the woman in liquor when you took her?
Murton. I cannot tell; she seemed very well to me; I took her about ten yards from the house.

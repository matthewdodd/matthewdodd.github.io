            , Esq; I lost the things laid in the indictment. I suspected the prisoner; he was my servant
: I took him up, and charged him. He confessed before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             he had taken and pawned them. I found them accordingly.

            , a pawnbroker, produced the things, which he deposed were pledged to him by the prisoner. The prosecutor swore to them as his property.

GEORGE WILLIAMS



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 6d.; the goods of 



James Hawes, from his person: having been before convicted.






JAMBS HAWES
. I am a clerk. On 29th Dec, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in Kingsland-road—I felt a tug at my coat behind, turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I took hold of his hand with the handkerchief, but he slipped his fingers through mine, and left the handkerchief in my hand—he then bobbed behind a pork-butcher's awning, and I went on, and about thirty or forty yards further I found the prisoner was walking after me again—I spoke to a policeman—he started off—the policeman took him.





JAMES HOCKING
 (policeman, N 181). I pursued the prisoner 200 or 300 yards—I told him what I took him for—he said he knew nothing of it—this is the handkerchief I got from the prosecutor.





FRANCIS HALIFAX
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Charles Jellett, Convicted Jan., 1848, and confined four months)—he is the person—I have seen him frequently with thieves.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

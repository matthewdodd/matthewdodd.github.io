THOMAS WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 coat, value 4s.; the goods of 



Charles Dean; having been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES DEAN.
 I keep a shop in Saville-row, Walworth-road. On the 31st of Aug., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I received information, and ran out—I missed a coat, which had been outside my shop—I informed the policemen—the coat has not been found.





CHARLES COUSINS.
 I am a journeyman butcher, and live in Baker's-row, Walworth. On Tuesday, the 31st of Aug., I saw the prisoner take a coat down from the front of the prosecutor's shop—he folded it up, and ran away with it—there was another man with him—I am quite sure the prisoner took it.





JAMES CASTLETON
 (policeman, P 33.) I found the prisoner running, and took him into custody.





WILLIAM COCKERELL
 (policeman, L 108.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this court—(read—Convicted the 21st of Sept., 1846, having been before convicted of felony, and confined nine months)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY. Aged 47.—


Transported for Seven Years.

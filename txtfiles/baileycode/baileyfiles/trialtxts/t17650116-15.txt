            . I live in Little Moor-fields


, with Mr. Pearce, who keeps a livery-stable; I catched the prisoner putting my coat and waistcoat into a bag, this day se'nnight, a little after twelve at noon, in a little house that we make use of, for a fort of a counting-house: I held him till assistance came; he said he came in there, to get out of the sight of a man he owed some money to. I had left my cloaths in that room, hanging. up, and he had got them partly into the bag, when I laid hold of him.

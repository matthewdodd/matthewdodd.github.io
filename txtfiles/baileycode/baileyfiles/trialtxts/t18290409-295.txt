            . I drive a cabriolet
. I lost my coat on the 5th of April, out of my master's stable, in John-street, Tottenham-court-road


; the door was shut but not locked - the gates were locked; I left it safe about half-past ten o'clock at night - I have seen the prisoner in the yard several times - he went out two or three times as odd man for my master
; he knew the yard very well - there were five or six coats taken at the same time, and I believe ten whips: I found mine on Salter.

            . I am a hackney-coachman. I bought this coat of the prisoner last Monday week, in the evening - he wanted 5s., but agreed to let me have it for 3s. 6d.; it is old and torn.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I bought three coats and ten whips in the Old Bailey, on the Saturday night, of a man in a New market cut-off coat; I sold two coats to a Jew.

            . I am a tripe-dresser, and live in Whitecross-street. About four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 4th of February. I was passing by the prosecutor's premises in Redcross-street


; I saw a little boy, about six years old, bring a cheese out of the shop in his pinafore, and join the prisoner, who was standing by the shopwindow - the prisoner put his hand on the little boy's shoulder, and told him to go on, which he did; the prisoner then took the cheese himself, and put it into his basket - the prosecutor and I followed him; the prisoner saw us; he threw it down, and went to a public-house - I am sure he is the man who received the cheese.

            . I live in Redcross-street; and sell cheese
. I was in my kitchen, and heard the door rush open - I got up, and missed a cheese; I found the prisoner at a public-house door - this is the cheese; I know it to be mine - it is a Wiltshire cheese, and worth about 10s. 6d.

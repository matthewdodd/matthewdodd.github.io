EDWARD WILLIAMS
. I am master of the Brig Alfred, which is on the Thames. On the 30th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another person in a boat as I came up the river—I asked the other to give me a lift past a rope, which he did—I then saw the prisoner and him go on board the Sprightly, and go down into the cabin—they then came on deck, and went over to the next ship—I saw the one who has escaped, on the larboard-bow, with a bundle, which he lowered down with a rope to the prisoner in the boat.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me on board? A. I did.





RICHARD AYLWARD
. I am mate of the Sprightly. This quadrant, and some pictures were on board—I saw them safe on the evening before, and missed them on the morning of the 30th of April—this is the quadrant—it if mine—these pictures belonged to William Howard Smith.





JOSEPH SMITH
. I am a Thames police-constable. I found this quadrant and pictures in a boat which the prisoner jumped out of—he jumped over-board from me—I took him—he bad this life-protector on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about the things; I went over the barges, and saw the man in the boat—he told me to make the rope Cast for him.




GUILTY
. *** Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

THOMAS JEFFS
. I am in partnership with my father and brother; we are contractors for the Dublin and Drogheda Railway. On Saturday, the 25th of March, I was in Dublin—I had occasion to change a cheque for 1194l. 13s. 9d. at the Royal Bank of Ireland—there is a bank called the Bank of Ireland, besides the Royal Bank—they are about fifty or sixty yards from each other—I received in exchange for my cheque ten 100l. notes, and the rest in other notes and cash—I put the notes and money in my pocket-book, which I put into my left hand pocket, and held it in my hand till I went into the Bank of Ireland—I there took out of it 450l.—I gave 150l. to my brother—I put my book into my left hand pocket again, and still kept hold of it till I got to the counter; I then let it go while I was indorsing three notes—when I put my hand to my pocket again my book was gone—there were, perhaps, a hundred people there—it is generally very much thronged on Saturdays—my pocket-book at the time I missed it contained six 100l. Irish notes—I immediately gave information—I know that there are packets which leave Kingston and Dublin for Liverpool, and there is one which leaves Dublin for London—one left Dublin for London that day, and arrived in London on the Thursday following.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Can you say that you did not drop your pocket-book? A. Yes, positively.





WILLIAM DYOTT BURNABY
. I am chief clerk at Bow-street Police-court. I produce two notes which I received, one from Mr. Vanghan, and one from Mr. Deane.





JOHN JAMES VAUGHAN
. I am a silversmith, and live in the Strand; I likewise change foreign notes. On the morning of the 27th of March I received this note from the prisoner about ten o'clock in the morning—it is an Irish bank-note for 100l., No. 75424, dated the 3rd of Feb., 1842—I did not know him before, though he was known at the house—he wanted change for the note, and I gave him a cheque for 98l. 6s. 8d., deducting 1l. 13s. 4d. for discount—he put his name and address on the note of his own accord, "Henry Stocker, No. 22, Swallow-street, Piccadilly"—on the Wednesday after I received information—I went to No. 22, Swallow-street, about twelve o'clock—I found the prisoner's name over the door, but I did not find him—the premises appeared shut up.





JOHN DEANE
. I am partner with Mr. Seeley; we live in Coventry-street, Haymarket. I exchanged one of these notes, No. 75420, for the prisoner on the 27th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon—I deducted 1l. 15s. for discount—he wrote his own name and address on the note.

Prisoner. Q. I believe I said I had been fortunate that morning in selling a quantity of stout? A. Yes; and he said he should have part of the discount to pay himself, as the person would not pay it all.





ABRAHAM PALMER
. I am one of the cashiers of the Bank of Ireland. On Saturday, the 25th of March, I paid some notes to a clerk of the Royal Bank of Ireland for a cheque of 3000l.—these are two of the twenty 100l. notes that I gave to the Royal Bank that day—four of the notes were paid into our bank that day—I have them—they are part of the notes that had been paid by me to a clerk of the Royal Bank.





ROBERT FREEMAN
. I am a clerk of the Royal Bank of Ireland. I received of Mr. Turner a cheque for 3000l.—I got it cashed, on the 25th of March, at the Bank of Ireland—I received 3000l. in notes from Mr. Palmer—I took them directly to Mr. Turner, the cashier of the Royal Bank.





TIMOTHY TURNER
. I am cashier to the Royal Bank of Ireland. I gave

a cheque to Mr. Freeman to be cashed at the Bank of Ireland on the 25th of March—I received from Mr. Freeman twenty 100l. notes—I do not know the dates, only the numbers—I paid ten of those notes to Mr. Jeffs—these two notes (looking at them) were amongst the number I paid to him.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any means of knowing that, but by the memorandum you have? A. I know it by the notes that still remain on hand—I paid Mr. Jeffs ten 100l. notes within a few minutes after I got them, and before I parted with the other ten, I had notice that these notes were lost—I referred to those still remaining—this is the memorandum I have of those remaining.





JOHN HAYNES
. I am an inspector of police. From information I received I apprehended the prisoner on the 31st of March, as he was going into his own lodging at No. 19, Garden-row, St. George's-road, or London-road—I told him what I took him for, and said anything that he said might be used either for or against him—he asked what I wanted him for—I said, "For those notes that you changed on Monday"—I think he said he could explain that, or something of that kind—I said if he did not give a satisfactory account who he took them of, I must take him into custody—he said he took them of a person named Feeling, a steward or mate of one of the Irish steamers for some stout, and he afterwards said he changed one at Mr. Vaughan's, in the Strand, and deducted 50l. for some stout he sold to Feeling, and after that he changed the other note at the request of Feeling, at Seeley and Deane's—I asked who Feeling was, and whether he had known him before—he said he had dealt with him before for small quantities of stout—that he had had a dozen or two at a time, but Feeling came on Friday and had a dozen of stout—that he came again on Saturday, and said, "What will you put me in twenty dozen for?" and he ordered twenty-four gross, or twelve gross—I asked where they were—he said at his stores, or warehouse, in Cushion-court—I asked how long he had been there—he said he had left Swallow-street on Monday, and his place of busines was Cushion-court—he said the stout was packed on Saturday by Jones, his cellar-man, and that Feeling came on Monday morning, between eight and nine, and fetched the stout away in his van and truck—he did not know where Feeling lived—I have been since then to Cushion-court—I did not find his name there—there are some cellars there—the first is in a Cushion-court, out of Broad-street, and then there is another Cushion-court, which is a narrow passage—there was a hamper and a few bottles, and the name of Painter on one door—I found some duplicates in the room the prisoner occupied—his wife gave them to me in his presence—he admitted they were his—some of these articles were pawned upwards of twelve months since—one is for three books pawned on the 7th of Jan., for two guineas—one for a book on the 20th of Feb., for 2s.; and on the 6th of Feb., an umbrella for 5s.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not, on your oath, tell him to tell all he knew, it would be better for him? A. No—I made inquiries, and no one knew the name of Stocker, in Cushion-court—I found out his cellarman, who knew that he lived there, but the woman who had charge did not—nor did one of the persons who occupied premises there—the landlord of the premises in Cushion-court is not here—I made inquiries in inner Cushion-court, and after great difficulty, I ascertained that a person of the name of Stocker occupied cellars there.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. From whom did you get information? A. From Jones's son—I have seen Jones about several times—I have not seen him here to-day—I saw him yesterday—I made inquiries of the neighbours, but heard no account from them.






EDWARD COOPER
. I live in Piccadilly—my father let the premises at No. 22 Swallow-street, to the prisoner—I know of his occupying them—his clerk delivered a notice to qnit to me, on Monday, the 27th, or Tuesday, the 28th of March—to the best of my knowledge, it was on Monday, the 27th—Rooke brought the key, and delivered it to me with the notice—I know the prisoner's writing—this notice is his handwriting.

Witnesses for the Defence.






MARTIN KENRICK
. I live in Long-lane, Smith field—I am a stationer, and newsvender, and am employed by Mr. Clare, a solicitor, of No. 5, Size-lane, as his clerk—I saw the prisoner on Saturday, the 25th of March, for the first time, and I never saw him since till now—I saw him at No. 5, Size-lane, as near as possible about ten minutes before six o'clock in the evening.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You are a newsvender and stationer? A. Yes—I have a shop, and am regularly employed by Mr. Clare—I go to him about ten in the morning, and leave about four—on the 25th of March, I left about a quarter past six—it was the only day I ever was later, and I had a particular occasion to be later that day—no one is here from Mr. Clare's—it takes me about ten minutes to walk from my residence to Mr. Clare's—I saw the prisoner at our office that evening—he told me his name was Mr. Stocker, and he wanted to see Mr. Park, as he had some goods to put into his warehouse—I believe there were two other clerks there—Mr. Park occupies the lower part of the house, which is a wine merchant's—I do not recollect that the prisoner said what sort of goods he had—he said he had two prickles that he wanted to put into the warehouse—I had never seen him before—he did not write his name—he was not there half a minute the first time—we told him to make haste back, as we wanted to close the warehouse—I did not see him the second time he came—I learned from my fellow-clerk that he came—I cannot tell how he was dressed—I did not notice him more than I would anybody else—I had only been with Mr. Clare about a fortnight at that time—I have been in the same business I am now in for nine years—I was not at the police court—a person called on me, and merely asked if I would attend—I said I would if I could be of any service—to-day is the first time I have seen the prisoner since I saw him in my master's office—I never saw him before then, nor since, till now—I have looked at him sufficiently to know that he is the person who called—I have not made any endeavour to see him—I did not trouble myself about it.

Q. How did the party who instructed my friend know that you would identify the person whom you had not seen since he was at your office? A. I have had no instructions and no communication with any one about it—neither of my fellow-clerks are here, to my knowledge—I have not been at the office to-day—I called there yesterday evening—no conversation took place, only that this case was adjourned to this day—I was requested on Saturday evening to be here—I did not then request to see the person I should be called to identify—I came here, not knowing that I should identify him, but I should know him again amongst a hundred.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Who attends to your business while you are here? A. My mother-in-law and my wife.





JOHN ROOKE
. I was clerk to the prisoner up to the 25th of March—I saw him on that day in Cushion-court, Broad-street—he owed me some salary—he did not pay me that night—he had told me in the day that he would call in the evening with it—he did not, and on the following day, being Sunday, I sent my daughter to his lodging with a note.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did you see him on that Saturday? A. Yes,

about half-past one, or perhaps two o'clock—I am his clerk—he dealt in stout, ale, wines, and spirits—he had books—I used to keep them, and booked most of the sales and the receipts of money, but not all—I did not book any sale of porter on the 24th or 25th—I do not know of any sale of porter or stout on the 25th—I have heard of the sale of porter and stout in Cushion-court—I was not clerk there, but in Swallow-street—I have been clerk to him since last June—he had cellars in Swallow-street, in which I was clerk—I cannot answer what business he did in Cushion-court—before I was his clerk I was clerk in a register-office in Chancery-lane, where I now am clerk—that is the only occupation I have followed of late years—I have been a provision broker—I was in a club-house at No. 60, Quadrant—you may call it a common hell, or what you please, I call it a club-house—play used to go on there, rouge et noir, hazard and roulette—I was employed as servant there—I used sometimes to turn the wheel for the flats—I was not tried for that—I have never been tried for anything—the proprietors of that place were not tried while I was there—I have helped in the operations of the gambling table—that is three or four years ago, or it may be five—it may be three or four years ago since I left that employment—when the new Police Act came in force, and the penalty came to 100l., I thought it was not worth my while following it—I knew the prisoner at that time—I do not know what he was then doing—I have known him from infancy—I knew him as clerk to Dr. M'Ginns—I became his clerk when he took the cellars—I do not know a person named Feeling—I have heard of such a person, but I have never seen him, to my recollection—I got part of my wages on that Sunday—it was some silver—I cannot recollect what—I cannot tell whether the prisoner was in distress.

MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have heard of Mr. Feeling? A. Yes—I suppose, by his name, he is an Irishman, and would have a better knowledge of Dublin than myself.





LOUISA ROOKE
. I am the daughter of John Rooke, and live with my father at No. 7, Poplar-row. I took the note to the prisoners residence, No. 19, Garden-row, on Sunday morning, the 26th of March; and, in consequence of that, the prisoner called on my father, and paid him some money—I am sure that was on Sunday, the 26th of March.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did you see the prisoner on that Sunday? A. Yes, at my father's—my father was at home, and he saw him, and paid him the money in my presence—I cannot tell how much it was—I did not count it—my father took the silver, and put it into his pocket—I cannot tell what time it was—I think it was about ten o'clock—I remember that Sunday so particularly, because my father had no money till Mr. Stocker came—that may have been the case before, but I do not recollect it—I have no sisters or brothers—we talked about this on the Sunday morning.

Q. But were you talking about the prisoner being charged, and that you were to be called to prove an alibi? A. Yes, I was told to speak the truth—my father has spoken to me about it—I will swear that he did not tell me to mind that it was that particular Sunday—I do not remember his saying anything about the day—I recollected the day immediately, when it was first called to my attention—I do not know who first called my attention to it—I recollect the day he came, because I took the note to him, which I had never done before—I do not know when it was first called to my attention that I would have to become a witness—it may be a fortnight or a week since—I will swear it was not a month since—it was not three weeks—my father was the first person who told me—I do not remember the words in which he told me—he did not tell me it was on a charge of stealing Irish Bank-notes—he does not tell me his affairs—he told me it was very likely I might be a witness called up by Mr. Stocker,

or through Mr. Stocker—he did not tell me what for—I asked what I was to be called up for, and he told me to mind my own business—I was to speak the truth about going to Mr. Stocker's house with a note—my father told me what it was about—I do not remember what he told me besides—it was about taking a note to Mr. Stocker's that Sunday—he did not tell me what Sunday—I understood it, because I never took a note to Mr. Stocker's, except on that day—I know it was on the 26th, because I am employed, and in that week I had earned less than I had any other week, and I could not give my father any money on the Sunday that I took the note—I take a memorandum of what I earn a week in a book which I have at home.





MARY LEE
. I live in Garden-row, London-road. The prisoner lodged with me previous to his being taken—he was at my house on quarter-day, the 25th of March—I am certain he was there at eleven o'clock in the morning, and about eleven at night—Louisa Rooke brought a note to my house on Sunday, the 26th of March, for Mr. Stocker.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How long had he lodged at your house? A. Two years and a quarter—I live with my husband—I think Louisa Rooke has been at my house on other days—it was not till Mr. Rooke called on me on Saturday last that I knew I should be wanted as a witness, merely to state that Mr. Stocker was at home on the 25th of March—he never slept out of my house for a month previous—he cannot get in without my knowing it—I open the door for him if I am up—if not, his wife does—Mr. Rooke mentioned to me the day, he said the Saturday previous to Mr. Stocker's being taken, which was the 25th of March—it was mentioned about his daughter bringing a note, but I cannot swear whether it came from Mr. Rooke or not—I cannot swear whether he asked me if I remembered the day on which his daughter brought a note—I was at home when the note was brought—I think it was between ten and eleven o'clock—I go to church sometimes, but I never leave the house in the morning—the prisoner has always slept at home—he came home sometimes at eleven or twelve at night, or sometimes later—I go to bed about eleven—he and his wife had only a bed-room in my house—I sleep on the first floor—I have two children—my little girl is twelve years old, and my boy is ten years—my little girl was at home on that Sunday.

MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is Stocker any relation, friend, or particular acquaintance of yours in any way? A. No; there is not the least reason in the world why I should come here to give false evidence.





EDWARD JONES
. I am the son of William Jones, the carman and wine-cooper—I was cellarman to Mr. Stocker—I remember seeing him on Lady-day, Saturday, the 25th of March—I saw him at different times—he was at Cushion-court nearly the whole day—I remember packing up, about that time, twelve gross of stout, by his direction—he was there, and kept his own tally—I am quite sure I saw him on that Saturday.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How long have you been in his employ? A. I should say about two months—he had not a very large stock in Cushion-court—I recollect other sales beside the twelve gross of stout—we were in the habit of selling out nearly every day—I took some the week before to Mr. Watkin, the tailor, who lives beyond Islington—Mr. Charles, a foreign merchant, was our next neighbour in Cushion-court—we did not serve any person in Cushion-court—we sent some to Size-lane, to Mr. Blackburn—I do not know whether it was to an attorney's office—I did not take it myself—I am sure it was not for a person named Kenrick—I know Rooke, as living with Mr. Stocker—I did not know him very well—the twelve gross of stout was not fetched away on the Saturday—I did not help to load it in the van—I did not see it fetched away—I do not know a customer of my master's named

Feeling—I have heard of him, but never saw him—I did not see him about that stout, to my knowledge—before I went to Mr. Stocker's I was travelling for Whitehead and Son, in the ink business—I had been with them about nine months, and had left them for about a month, in consequence of their leaving business—I was given to understand that I should be wanted as a witness—I have attended all the examinations, but have never been called—no one told me I should be called—I have been spoken to on the subject by several—I have stated what I could prove, I believe to a Mr. Shaw—that was on the Saturday morning on which Mr. Stocker was taken into custody—I made the statement in the outer office at Bow-street—I was taken there by Shaw, I believe his name is—he is a policeman—he asked me whether I remembered packing a quantity of stout on the 25th—I told him I did—I did not know I was to be called as a witness—yesterday was the first time I was here—Mr. Rooke told me this case was appointed for yesterday—I had had communication with him before—I consider myself still in Stocker's service.

Q. Have you or have you not, made any statement to be examined upon? A. The only statement I have made has been to Shaw; but that was made in presence of Mr. Haynes, the inspector—to my knowledge I have not made any other statement to any other person—I had some conversation with Mr. Rooke about it on the day I left him at Bow-street, after Stocker was taken into custody on Saturday morning, the 1st of April—that was the first time I had seen Rooke after Stocker's apprehension—I had seen him several times before at the other house in Swallow-street—I had conversation with Rooke about this affair—he asked me what I knew about it—we did not talk about the day—I told him what I knew about seeing Stocker on the 25th, and packing the stout, and all that—I believe Mr. Stocker had the stout, and the different articles he sold, from Howard's, Irish stout merchants, in Thames-street.

Prisoner. From Sweetman and Howard's, in Miles'-lane.





WILLIAM JONES
. I am father of the witness, Edward Jones—I am a winecooper and carman—I am in the habit of carting goods for Stocker—I remember the evening of Lady-day, which was Saturday—I saw him that day at his cellars—I had previous to that day removed stock from Swallow-street to the cellars in Cushion-court.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Had you any conversation with Stocker that evening? A. Yes, I had.
(George William Jennings, of Clerkenwell; James Woodley, of Walworth; William Rogers, of the Crown and Anchor, Kent-road; and Benning Austin, of the Age newspaper, gave the prisoner a good character.)

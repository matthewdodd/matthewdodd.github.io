                  Mackenzey 
               



            . My husband's name is Alexander. The prisoner was out of place; I let her lie along with me.
Q. Where do you live?
Mackenzey. I live at the upper end of the Hay market


; am a lodger; on Friday last the prisoner went out betwixt 8 and 9 o'clock for some snuff, and did not return. In about ten minutes after that, I missed a parcel of stuff, called Scotch plaid, about 13 yards of it, and a duffil cloak out of the room.
Q. Where is your husband?
Mackenzey. He is gone to the East-Indies. I went to justice Fielding, and got her and the things advertised; and on the Saturday after a pawnbroker came to me with the plaid. (Produced in court and deposed to.) This is the cloak that I have now on.
Q. How came you by that again?
Mackenzey. The prisoner had it on when taken.
Mr. Barnewell. I am a pawnbroker: the prisoner at the bar brought this plaid to me on the 31st of March, about noon; I lent her a guinea and a half upon it; after that it was advertized; then I found the prisoner, and took her up and carried her before justice Fielding. She had the cloak on.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take them away with a design to steal them only to raise a little money, and then to fetch them again when I could.

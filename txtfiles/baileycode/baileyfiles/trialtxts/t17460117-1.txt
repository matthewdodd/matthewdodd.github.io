Q. In what Manner?
Drummond. As I was going home to my Family I met three Women; I pass'd two of them, and this Woman, the Prisoner, stuck by me; I found her Hand in my Pocket.

Drummond. Yes.
Q. How could you be sure it was the Prisoner, when there were other Woman about you?

Q. How much Money was there?
Drummond. Fifteen Shillings.
Q. You say your 15 s. were gone; were not the other Women as close to you at any Time, that they might put their Hands into your Pocket.
Drummond. They were not so close.
Q. Do you know the Prisoner to be the Woman?

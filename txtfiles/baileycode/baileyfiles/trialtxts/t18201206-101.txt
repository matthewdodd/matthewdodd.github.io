            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. On the 10th of November, I searched the prisoner's house at Fulham, and found this harness concealed in a cupboard on the right hand side of the fire-place; the cupboard was papered over to conceal them, and pictures hung over it; the paper was quite dry. The prisoner was not at home; I apprehended him the same evening a quarter of a mile off.

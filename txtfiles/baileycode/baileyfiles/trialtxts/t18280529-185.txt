RICHARD LANG. I am a carpenter
, and live in White Lion-street, Norton-folgate


. On the 2d of May, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I was returning up Blossom-street, opposite my own house, and saw the prisoner come out of my door with this table; it is a private house; I went up, and asked where he was going with it, and whose it was - he said it was no ones; I said it was mine - he dropped it, and ran off; I pursued, and took him. My door is sometimes on the latch - the table stood on the first floor landing.
Prisoner's Defence. A man asked me to help him move: if he had gone into the door he would have seen him.
PROSECUTOR. I saw no man.

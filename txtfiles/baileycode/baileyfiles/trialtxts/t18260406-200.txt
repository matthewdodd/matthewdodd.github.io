MARY AYRE. I am single, and keep a china-shop
 in Strutton-ground, Westminster


. I did not see the prisoner near my house - but I had these two decanters in my shop-window on the morning of the 25th of March, and missed them between six and seven o'clock that evening; I informed the street-keeper, and he found them - I have had them these two years, and know them to be mine - my shop-window is not open; the prisoner is quite a stranger.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Dyer, who is a pawnbroker. These decanters were pawned by the prisoner on the 25th of March, between five and six o'clock in the dusk of the evening.

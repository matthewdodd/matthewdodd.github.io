GEORGE WAY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of November, 1 ounce of tinsel lace, value 6d.; and 1 shilling; the goods and monies of 



William Mitchell his master.






WILLIAM MITCHELL
. The prisoner was in my employ on the 26th of November—in consequence of having missed things I marked ten half crowns, and 17 shillings—I put them into my desk, and locked the counting-house—I

did not lock the desk—it was all right at ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 30th of November—I returned to the counting-house at eleven o'clock—I counted the money, and found one shilling missing—there were evident marks of shoes against the raised partition which forms the counting-house, which could be got over by means of a ladder—there were marks of getting over—I called in an officer, who searched the prisoner, and found one shilling on him, which was marked—he searched his box, and found this tinsel lace—the prisoner was a porter to clean boots &c.





JOSEPH SHACKELL
. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found on him this shilling, and in his box found the tinsel lace.





WILLIAM MITCHELL

re-examined. On Monday I gave the prisoner a shilling—I am certain it was not the one I gave him—this has a small "k" over the king's head.

Prisoner. On the Monday night Mr. Mitchell gave me a shilling to get a sole for his supper—I put that into my pocket with other money. Witness. I gave you a shilling, but not that shilling; it was one I took out of my pocket—they were all marked with a punch which I have in my pocket.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Seven Years.

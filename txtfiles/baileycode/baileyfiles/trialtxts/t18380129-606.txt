EDWARD DENNINS
. I live at No. 20, Kingsgate-street, Holborn. About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 26th of January, I was going into the prosecutor's shop for three quartern loaves—I had got in, and the prisoner came running past me with the till under his arm—he ran out—I followed him all down Devonshire-street—he put the till down at the corner of East-street, and ran off—I took the till, and ran after him—I saw him taken by a policeman—he is the same boy.





JAMES HENDERSON
. I am the master of the shop. This till is mine—it was kept under the counter—I was out at this time—it contained one half-crown, one penny, thirty-one halfpence, and a hundred and two farthings, when it was found—there might have been a little more.





JONATHAN WHICHER
 (police-sergeant E 47.) I took the prisoner in charge.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to look after work, and could get none—I was going along, and heard the cry of "Stop thief," and I looked to see who it was—a butcher boy came and caught hold of me, and they said I had stolen the till, but I had not.




GUILTY
. Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years to the Prison Ship.

            . I am a baker
, and live in Church-lane, Whitechapel. On the 21st of June I saw the prisoner at the Compter with some of my bread - he said he bought them of my men, who made them of the customers - they call them dead men.
JOHN M'GANN. I am the prosecutor's servant. I went out with a barrow and twenty-five loaves. I had to go up Shoe-lane with a loaf, and left my barrow at the corner of Fleet-street; on my return I saw a mob, who said they saw a baker load his basket out of my barrow. I ran down Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner offering a loaf for sale to the fishwomen. He went up to one corner of the market, and there was a basket of bread, which I knew to be mine. I told him so. He asked me how I could know them? I said I knew them by the quality - I will swear they are mine. I lost five quartern and two half-quartern loaves. The lock of my barrow was broken open.

            . I am a journeyman baker. I can swear to the bread - I saw it before the Alderman.
Prisoner's Defence. A man gave me the basket of bread to sell, at the Tap in Drury-lane.

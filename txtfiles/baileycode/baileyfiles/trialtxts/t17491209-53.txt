            . Those two men and one Cragoe robbed me, as I was coming down Fenchurch Street; one of them said, who are you Sir, I said I walk by myself, and dont want to speak to no body; Cragoe then knock a me two times, and after that, I knock a Cragoe down, and knock a Shorer down, then Davis knock a me down; they all ran away together; I run after them, and got this cane again from Cragoe, and took Cragoe; but Shorer and Davis ran away with my wig and my hat.
Court, You must tell the truth.
Bruce. I am sure this is true, my Lord.
Q. Where do you live?
Bruce. I am Mr. Gardener's Servant
 in Prince's Street. [The Prosecutor is a black, and speaks very broken English ]


                  Thomas 
                  Cragoe 
               



            . I was one of the three Persons who robbed the Black; 
               
                  William 
                  Davis 
               



            , and I, was coming together from Rag-Fair; and met with 
               
                  Edward 
                  Shorer 
               



             by Aldgate; the fourth of December at night; I have been acquainted with Davis, about six weeks, but I never was concerned with Shorer before, Davis has an Image done with gun powder on his breast. (it was showed in court.) Davis and Shorer were acquainted before. We all went together to see what we could get on the sneak, that is to take things out of Shops, and the like; going along Fenchurch-street, the Black was before us; 
               
                  William 
                  Davis 
               



             and I put our hands into his pockets, he turned about, and ask'd us what we wanted, we bid him go along about his Business, he went on; we went up to him, and he crost the way; and we cross'd too; he turn'd about, and ask'd us what we waned, he held his stick up to strike me; I took hold of it; he then took hold round my neck, and bit me over my eye; I cried out, and 
               
                  Edward 
                  Shorer 
               



             came and took the cane out of his hand, and hit him over the head; the Black went to Shorer, and took his cane again out of his hand; then the black took his knife out of his pocket: in the mean time Davis and Shorer ran away; but I was taken and carried to the Compter: I did not see either of them take his hat or wig, only as the black said he had lost them.
Q. Did Shorer know your intention in going a robbing, before, this affair?
Cragoe. Yes my Lord, he knew we had stole a hat before for, we had told him of it; and when we met with him, he agreed to go on this business.
Both

EDWARD RUBERY. I keep a sale shop
, 22, Brick-lane, Spitalfields


. I lost the waistcoat on the 23d of April, about six in the evening, I was in the parlour; I perceived the prisoner snatch at a waistcoat that hung at the shop door. He did not succeed in running away with it. He only unfastened one of the pins. I went and fastened the waistcoat, and waited in the shop a few minutes, expecting the prisoner's return. He almost instantly returned, snatched the waistcoat away by force, and ran off with it. I cried stop thief. He dropped the waistcoat. I pursued him, and brought him back. This is the waistcoat; it is mine; I value it at three shillings.
Q. What age is he - A. About fourteen, I believe.
Prisoner's Defence. The man did not see me take the waistcoat. I am sure there were a many people in the street.

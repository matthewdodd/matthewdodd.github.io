            . My wife was ill, and the prisoner was recommended as a chair-woman, she was with me till 4 o'clock in the afternoon, then I discharged her, at 6 in the evening there was a tea-spoon missing and some new cloth, this was on the Friday; on the Tuesday night she came for some ham, I taxed her with taking the things, she owned the fact, but would not say where the things were; by enquiring I found the spoon stopped by Mrs. Morgan, and the cloth pawned there.
Mrs. Morgan deposed, the prisoner pawned the linnen with her; but when she came with the spoon, the prisoner went for some body to prove it was her own, and did not return.
The prisoner said in her defence, she was a little out of her mind, and had got a very bad husband.

            . I was at St. Paul's Church


 on the 21st of last month. I laid my hat down on the bench the church: I looked for it about ten minutes after and missed it; I turned round and saw the prisoner with it in his hand. I stopped him; he said, he took it in a mistake: I took him out of the church, and took my hat from him, he had his own hat in his hand at the same time, the constable of the church came up, and I gave him charge of the prisoner.

            . I have had the hat in custody ever since. (producing it.)
Q. Is the prosecutors hat, and the prisoners hat much alike?
Read. No, his own was an old shabby hat, not cocked.
Prisoner's Defence.
I stood by the gentleman in the church, going out I took his hat instead of my own by mistake.

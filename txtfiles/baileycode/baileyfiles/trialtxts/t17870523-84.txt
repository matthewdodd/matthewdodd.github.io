            ; I lost 15 lb. of tin last Tuesday was se'night; the prisoner was a labourer
 with me; I employed him to weigh parcels; it is an article we always keep locked up under padlocks and keys; it is used in the scarlet dying business; they cannot dye scarlet in grain without it; it kills aquafortis, and the aquafortis eats that up; when the prisoner had done weighing, he came to me into the counting-house, and said, Sir, shall you want any more, shall I lock it up; it was at noon; I told him to lock up the ware-house, which he did, and brought me the key; after that, I believe in less than half an hour, one of my principal men in the shop desired me to come into the shop, he had something to communicate to me; I believe in a quarter of an hour.

             sworn.
I saw the prisoner take the tin from behind the tub that Mr. Spackman has been speaking about; he went towards the coal-hole; I suspected he was going to conceal it, and I acquainted Mr. Spackman with it, this was after he had done weighing; then Mr. Spackman set the boy to watch; his name is

            ; in the evening at eight o'clock, I saw it taken out of his pocket at the shop door in Leather-lane;

             stopped him and Mackenzie, and took it out of his pocket; he was going home; Davidson and this Mackenzie followed him; I saw him take it from the shop window; the tin that was taken out of his pocket was brought into the shop, and we sent for Mr. Spackman immediately, and acquainted him of it, and the prisoner was committed; the tin was committed to

            's care; I only saw the prisoner take one piece.

             sworn.
I was set to watch the prisoner about eleven in the morning; my master told me a person had secreted some metal among the coals, and desired I would watch; my master shewed me the metal among the coals; I watched, and about three or four minutes before eight, I walked backwards and forwards in the shop, and when I came into the back shop, I missed the man, I saw him in the coal-hole; he came out again, walked about the shop very leisurely, and said, how early he would be in the morning; I took an opportunity of going to the coal-hole, and found the metal was gone; it was tin; I looked at his pocket, but I could not perceive any thing in it so as to satisfy myself; I hit my leg against his pocket, and I saw by the weight, there was something in his pocket; he went out sometime after, and I called Mackenzie, and we went after him and took two pieces of grain tin out of his pocket; I saw Mackenzie take out the other piece out of the other pocket; I locked it up, and know this is the same I took from him, but I cannot be sure it is the same my master had; there is no particular mark upon it.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I cannot say any further, than I was in liquor.
Prosecutor. I do not know the tin, only that it is of the same kind; it is broke into ten thousand pieces; he confessed taking it before the Justice; I made him no promises; I am sure of that; he said, he could not tell where he was going to take it, but if he could not sell it, he would bring it back again.
Jury. Was he in liquor at the time they took him? - Not when he put it in the coals; I believe he was in liquor when he was taken; he had been with me a year and an half; I had so high an opinionof him, that he is the last of the labourers that I should have suspected.

               Transported for seven years
            .
Court. Have you any reason to believe that you have been robbed or lost any of your property while this man was with you? - Yes, I have; nevertheless I say now, he was the last of the labourers that I should have suspected.
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

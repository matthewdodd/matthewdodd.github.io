            . I am servant to Taylor, and was collecting pots in Cadogan-street on the 6th of this month - I saw the prisoner walking towards Sloane-street - she dropped a pot from under her shawl - I thought she had stolen it - I followed and found these four pots upon, three in her apron, and one under her shawl - she was three or four yards from my master's house when I saw her first.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work at the building and supposed that these pots belonged to the Cable public-house, and was taking them home as I had done several times before.
PROSECUTOR. The prisoner gave her address No. 12, New-road, which was false, and the landlord of the Cable knows nothing of her.

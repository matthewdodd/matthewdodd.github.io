             sworn.
On Tuesday the 24th of last month, about ten in the morning, I went out from Newgate-street to go to Chelsea; I am a linen-draper
; when I returned I found a pane of glass in the window had been broken, and two handkerchiefs taken out; the prisoner was then in custody in Wood-street Compter.

             sworn.
On the 24th of last month I saw the prisoner and two others lurking about, I had a suspicion, I watched them, they went up a court, and had some conversation, they came back, and went to the shop-window of the prosecutor; I heard some glass break, and saw the prisoner with something white in his hand, I pursued him, and knocked him down, and took those two muslin neck handkerchiefs out of his pocket.
The property deposed to by the prosecutor.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I picked them up in Newgate-street.



               GUILTY

Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

            . I live at the Brown-Bear, in Moor Fields



. I am a publican
. The boy at the bar lived with me a month all but two days. On the 25th of November, I missed a silver table-spoon; the boy was in the house half an hour before it was missing. I had stirred some brandy and water with it that morning about eight; the prisoner went away the same day about ten. After that, I found it at Mr. Seabrook's, a pawnbroker, who had stopped the woman at the bar with it.
Q. Where had you put the spoon, after you stirred the brandy and water with it?
M. Hines. It was put in the bar.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Snow-Hill. The boy at the bar brought this table-spoon to me, on the 25th of November, about nine in the morning; I asked him, how he came by it? he said, he brought it from his mother; I returned it him, and desired him to let his mother come with it. In the afternoon, the mother, (the woman at the bar) came with it. I asked her, if it belonged to her? she said, she brought it from Mrs. Williams's, in Turn-again-Lane: I said, I would keep the spoon; and desired her to send Mrs. Williams to me. On the Saturday morning, the woman came again; and I insisted on her bringing Mrs. Williams. She brought another woman, named Skeyton; I asked Mrs. Skeyton, how long she had had that spoon? she said, about fifteen years: I asked her the marks upon it? she could not tell me. I asked Mrs. Hines, where her son lived? she said, at Mrs. Hines's, at the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear 
               



            , Moor-Fields. I went there to know farther about it; and Mr. Hines came and said, he had missed the boy, and claimed the spoon.

            's Defence.
I did not know of my son's leaving his place, till he came home; when he said, Mother, I have found a spoon; I asked him, where? he said, in Turn-again-Lane. I chided him for it. I never found him guilty of stealing any thing in my life.

            . I have known the woman at the bar between three and four years; she always behaved with great honesty to me; I have employed her.
Q. What are you?
M. Mitchel. I am a green-grocer.

            . The woman at the bar was a lodger with me about three months to the time this happened. The boy came home on the Friday, and left his basket upon the table. She said, what is this boy come away for? I cannot think what is the matter! A lad that was there, said, he believed he was in at the Baptist's head. When he came in, his mother said, now come along, and let us go to your master; the boy said, my master is not in the way, if I do; I will go with you to-morrow. He again said, come along, mother, I have found something; she said, what is it? he shewed her a spoon. Where did you find it? said she; said he, I found it in Sea-coal Lane. Then she said, I will go and get you a pair of shoes, and you shall go to your master in the morning.

            . I live in Cold-bath-field


; the prisoner did live in the neighbourhood; he came and lodged at my house, he staid only two nights; I found the door of my room open when I went to bed, and two days after my wife told me she missed the things; he was still in his lodging; I took him up, and charged him; he said he had made a mistake, and was sorry for it, and if we would let him alone, he would tell us where they were; I told him I would be as favourable as I could; then he took us to the houses where they were; we found the bed-gown at Mr. Sharpe's, a pawnbroker in Leather-lane; and a waistcoat, shift, shirt, bed-gown, and breeches at Mr. Chandler's, in Baldwin's-gardens; and the other things at Mrs. Fox's in Field-lane; the prisoner is a smith
 by trade.
Prisoner's defence.
I was out of work, and greatly distressed for want; I made use of these thing to get my own out of pawn.

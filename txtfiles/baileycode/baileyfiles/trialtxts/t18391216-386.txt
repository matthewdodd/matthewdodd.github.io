 stealing, on the

Isaac Starling.






ISAAC STARLING
. I live at Lewisham, in Kent. I had a mare—I turned it out on the 3rd of December in a gravel-pit on Blackheath—I went the next morning, and she was gone—I found Ford with her last Friday morning in Smithfield—I have seen the two prisoners together on the road about six weeks ago between Shooter's-hill and Blackheath.

Cross-examined by
MR. ESPINASSE. Q. Are you quite sure it was the same mare? A. Yes.





HENRY DANIEL FORD
. Yesterday fortnight I was going up White-chapel, and met John Hill riding this mare—I knew him by having seen him the Sunday before, and I said, "Holloa, where are you going to take that?"—William Hill ran up to me, and said, "What is that worth to you?"—I bought it of him for 16s.

W. J. HILL—

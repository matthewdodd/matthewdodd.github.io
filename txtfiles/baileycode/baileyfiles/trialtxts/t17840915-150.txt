I was sent after the prisoner, and found him in the yard at the Bear and Ragged-staff Inn, in Smithfield, with the skins under his arm; I brought him to the warehouse, he said he was going to sell them to a Jew; he said it was the first time, he did not deny but they were his master's property.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I took up this bundle and thought it was my linen; I went to this inn, and when I came to open it, I found it was not my linen, and I was going to take it back.

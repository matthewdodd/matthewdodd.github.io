It appeared that the Prosecutors lost their Goods, and that the Prisoner was taken in Whit Chapel-Lane offering the same to sale for a Penny a Pound; that he confess'd both Facts before the Justice, but now denyed them, and said that a Man as he was coming from Highgate gave him the Goods, but could not prove it. The Jury found him

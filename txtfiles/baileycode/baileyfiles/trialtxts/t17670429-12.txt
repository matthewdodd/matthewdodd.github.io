. On the 23d of February I was in my parlour, and left the other evidence in the shop; he came backwards to me, and in the mean time somebody opened the door. My wife said, Run; then Webb ran out, and took the prisoner with the two pair of slippers, my property upon her. (Produced in court.)

            . I was journeyman to the prosecutor; I went backwards to my master, somebody was heard to come into the shop; I ran out and catched the prisoner, before she got four yards from the shop door, with these slippers in her right hand. I took hold of her; she threw the slippers down; I brought her and them in, and know them to be my master's property.
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming by and picked them up from the ground; I was not in the shop at all; I am a glove-maker

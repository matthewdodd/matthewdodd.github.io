. On the 3d of November I was up stairs at breakfast, and heard somebody below. I went down, could see nobody, and was going up again when I saw a chaise move. I stood on the stairs, and saw the prisoner stand up with the knee boot rolled up under his arm. He walked further into the shop and laid hold of a phaeton knee boot. I seized him; he asked me to let him go, and said he really did not cut it off, and that he was going to bring it to me - a knife was found on him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went there to ask for work; a man went rather quick out of the shop. The knee boot laid on the ground; I folded it up, and went towards the stairs with it.

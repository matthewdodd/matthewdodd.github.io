I am a house-keeper in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell


. On Thursday the 19th of November, my house was broke open; a square of glass was broke in the window: I was not at home.

                   Walker
               



            . The 19th of November the window was broke; I was in a little back room joining the shop, and I heard the window crack; as near as I can guess it was eight; it was quite dark; I heard the shop window break; and there was a light in the shop, and I saw something like a person's arm drawing out; and the window was broke, and the shelf all clear facing the square of glass; it was cleared of the shoes that stood before the square of glass; they were red morocco shoes; I cannot say how many pair were lost, but on Saturday two pair were brought into our shop to sell with my husband's writing in them, they were brought by a woman that is in court: the shoes are here: I am sure those shoes were mine; my husband's hand writing was on the bottom and the price they were to be sold at: we had not sold any of that sort for some time back, as red morocco shoes are not so much worn in winter; but these came back tacked together as they are now.

             sworn.
I am servant to Mrs. Munday, she keeps a chandler's shop. I went out of doors. I live next door to the prosecutor; and I saw the prisoner watching about the door a long time; it was Thursday the 19th of November, about eight; I asked him what he wanted there? and he said, what was that to me: I did not see him do any thing to the window; I was forced to be in doors: I did not see him break the window: I have lived next door to the prisoner four years; I know him and his father and mother; he is a chimney sweeper
: there was a light in the shop window: the prisoner is the person; I saw his face, and spoke to him then; there was no lamp near there: I never had any concern with him before to speak to him, but I know him by his face.

             sworn.
I am a shoemaker by trade: the prisoner offered to sell me the duplicate of the shoes for eighteen-pence.
Who was it? - Sweep.
Was it Dowton? - Yes; it was a duplicate of two pair of shoes, he said he had found two pair; I got them out of pawn by the duplicate; Sweep gave me the duplicate,and I gave him eighteen-pence halfpenny for it, and a quartern of gin, and two-pence to buy him another quartern: I took the shoes out of pawn; the pawnbroker lives in Leather-lane, I do not know his name: I sent a woman with the shoes to this shop to sell them; I did not know they were stolen; I sent them by a shopmate's wife.

             sworn.
The last witness is delirious at times. I am a shoe-maker's wife: the last witness works with my husband; the last witness brought two pair of shoes out of pawn, and brought them to our room, and I saw my husband clean them; they were children's red morocco shoes; and this last witness asked me to carry them to sell to the next shoe-maker's, which is a neighbour, Mr. Walker's; I carried them, and shewed them to Mr. Walker on Saturday (this day three weeks) towards the evening; Mr. Walker looked at them, and said they were his; I said, I could produce the man that gave them to me, and I produced Staples; I left the two pair of shoes with Mr. Walker: I should know them again.

             sworn.
I am Headborough of Clerkenwell: I took charge of the prisoner by desire of Walker; they were two pair of red morocco shoes; I have had them ever since.
(The shoes deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I picked up the duplicate last Thursday, and I sold it to that good man; it was not in my name, but in a contrary name.
Court. Is the pawnbroker here? - I did not think there was any occasion. The prisoner told me he picked up the shoes wrapped up in a paper, at Mr. Wells's door, the pawnbroker in Turnmill-street.
The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.




               GUILTY of stealing, but not of breaking and entering
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

GEORGE SMITH
 and 




JAMES DRISCOLL
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
9th of September, 25 yards of printed cotton, value 12s.; and 1 handkerchief, 3s. 6d., the goods of 



Thomas Pratt; and that Driscoll had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD BIRKETT
. I live with Mr. Thomas Pratt, a linen draper, in Tottenham-court-road—on the 9th of September the two prisoners came and asked to look at a shirt—I asked whether they would like a white or a

coloured one—I showed them one, and Smith said that was not the pattern—I brought another at 1s. 6d.—they offered 1s. 3d. and bought it—they left—the policeman came afterwards and I missed twenty-five yards of cotton and a handkerchief—these are them—I had seen them safe ten minutes before they came.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Is not this a common pattern? A. We had no other like it—a young man had been showing this to a customer ten minutes before—Smith bought the shirt—it was about eight o'clock on Saturday night.





JOHN SIMS HANCOCK
 (police-sergeant E 12.) About a quarter past eight that night I saw the two prisoners in Percy-street, close by the prosecutor's, going towards Mary-le-bone—Smith was carrying this print and handkerchief, and Driscoll was carrying this shirt in a paper—I followed and caught them in Union-street—when I seized them, Smith kicked me violently—Driscoll got from me, but I caught him again, put him into a shop, and secured them—they said they came from Pimlico—Smith said they had picked them up in Euston-square, and Driscoll said what Smith said was true—Driscoll seemed as if he was going to hand his parcel to Smith—I found this other handkerchief on Smith's neck at the station.





WILLIAM ECKETT
 (police-constable D 54.) I produce a certificate of Driscoll's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—he is the boy.

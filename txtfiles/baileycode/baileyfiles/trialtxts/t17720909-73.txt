                  Sarah
                   Hale
               



             deposed, that she had frequently received halfpence of the prisoner at the rate of 540 for a guinea.


                  Joseph
                   Thompson
               



             deposed, that on the Thursday fortnight, he saw a quantity of new halfpence in the possession of a person in the Fleet Market; suspecting them to be counterfeit he made some enquiry about them, and was directed to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hale
               



            , who was then in sight, as the person that paid the counterfeit money; upon which he stopt her, and found five shillings worth of new halfpence upon her; that he took her into custody, when she said she had received them of the prisoner for quilting; the prisoner came and told the same story; they then searched the prisoner's house, where they found a pair of dies, and all the implements necessary for coining halfpence.
Mr. Yeo, the engraver of dies in the Mint, deposed, that the half-pence were counterfeit.
The prisoner, in her defence, said, that she never paid Hale more than twenty one shillings for a guinea; and that the implements for coining that were found in her apartments were left there by some people that had lodged with her.

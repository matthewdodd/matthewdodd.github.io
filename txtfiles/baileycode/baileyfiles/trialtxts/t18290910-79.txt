            . On the 24th of July, as I was passing through Holborn


, about eleven o'clock at night, I felt a tug at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I turned and saw the prisoner and another; I followed the prisoner about thirty yards, and then charged him with it - he denied it, but I found it in his bosom; it has my mark on it.

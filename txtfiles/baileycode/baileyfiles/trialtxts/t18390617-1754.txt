GEORGE DOBBS
. I am in the coal trade, and live in Charles-street, Bridgwater-square. The prisoner had been nine or ten days in my service—he had been with me once before a little while—when he took goods out I expected him to return me the money if he received it—he was to account to me for it on the same day, as soon as he returned with it—he did not account to me for 1s. 8d. on the 20th of May—I discharged him On the Tuesday morning—I did not find this out till after I had discharged him—I did not speak to him about it, but when he took out the coals, I asked if he had received the money—he said, "No," and I booked them.





MARY ANN HARTLEY
. I am servant to Mrs. Cotterell—she deals with the prosecutor for coals. On the 20th of May I paid the prisoner 1s. 8d. for coals—he did not give me a receipt—it was exactly four o'clock in the afternoon of Monday.

Prisoner's Defence. I received the 1s. 8d. t and gave it to my master—and on Tuesday morning he sent me away, took my shoes off my feet, and said it was because I told his customers he gave six pounds short in a cwt,—I did riot like to see these people cheated, and I told them. Witness. It is all false.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

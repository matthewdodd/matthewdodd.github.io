            . I am servant to Mr. Matteson. On the day in the indictment, as I was going up stairs, I met the prisoner on the second flight, coming down with the property in question; she enquired for a gentleman of a different name from that of any one living in the house. The coats were on her arms; I called a gentleman whose chambers were on the first floor to assist me. She was secured, and an officer was sent for; one coat belonged to my master, and the other to Mr. Boyes.
Prisoner's Defence. These things were on the stairs, and I was obliged to take them up out of the way, that I might pass, and this woman came out, and said, I stole them.

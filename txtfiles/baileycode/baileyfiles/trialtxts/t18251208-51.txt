            , JUN. I know the defendant's hand-writing, and have seen him write several times; to the best of my belief the signature to this affidavit is his writing.
Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Do you mean to say you have seen him write, or have seen what was said to be his writing? A. I have seen him write several times - about twelve months ago, or less - I know it to be his writing. I have seen him write at his lodgings at Westminster, and I think it was in John-street - and at a public-house in Holborn, he wrote a note to his attorney - and at Westminster he was copying something from a book, and frequently gave it me to read, to see if it was correct; and when he practiced as a doctor, he used to write bills to give to unfortunate women, and he used to sign his name to them - I saw that often.
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Look at these two documents; are they in the defendant's hand-writing? A. In my judgment both are written by him - but only one bears his signature; I have no doubt of that one.

            . I am clerk to Mr. Dawson, of Camden-town, attorney for this prosecution. I took out a summons for the prosecutrix's solicitor, at Mr. Justice Holroyd's chambers, and was at the hearing of it on the 14th at Guildhall.
This summons was here read: - it was for the defendant to appear to shew cause why he should not be held to bail in a certain action of trover, brought against him by Mary Lee.
The affidavit was here read, in which the defendant swore, that on or about August, 1824, being a lodger with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Lee
               



            , at No. 2, Jewin-street, he agreed to purchase of her certain articles of furniture, which she declared herself compelled to part with, and for which he paid her 44l., in manner following: - on the 19th of August 3l., the 26th 2l. 10s., the 2d of September 2l., the 19th 1l. 10s., the 16th 3l. 10s., the 23d 2l. 5s., the 30th 2l. 10s., the 14th of October 3l. 5s., the 28th 2l., the 4th of November 2l. 10s., the 18th 3l., the 25th 2l. 10s., the 2d of December 3l., the 9th 2l. 10s., the 18th 4l. 10s., the 2d of January 2l., the 9th 1l. 10s. - that he continued to pay for his lodging at a reduced rent, in consequence of the furniture being his own, till the 12th of May last, when she informed him her circumstances had become embarrassed, and desired him to remove his furniture, and to take the charge of hers, which he consented to, and removed some of her furniture on the 21st and 23d of May, to No. 26, Upper Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell, and that on or about the 26th of May she called on him there, and took them away, and that he had detained none except what he had bought of her.


                  MARY 
                  LEE
               



            . I live in Shaftsbury-place, Aldersate-street - the prisoner lodged with me when I lived in Jewin-street; he came on the 20th of December, 1824, and left on the 6th of January; (he had lodged with me once before) - the furniture in his apartment was mine - I never parted with any of it to him; he occupied the attic the second time he lodged there, and paid 6s. a week - he only had one room - the rent was never reduced. I never had any conversation with him about selling any part of the goods - nor ever told him, I wished to part with them for my subsistence - I never sold him any of the goods at all. On the 20th of May, 1825, (a long time after he had left the lodging), I informed him I was in embarrased circumstances, and wished him to take an apartment for me to deposit my furniture in,being apprehensive of an execution; he very readily agreed to take an apartment for me, and to superintend the removal - part of them were removed on the 21st, and the rest on the 23d; he told me he had removed them, and they were safe - but never told me properly where they were gone; he told me he had moved them into the Borough - but did not say where there - he had told me at first, that he had moved them to Somer's-town, but did not say where. We had received some information that they were in Upper Rosamond-street - he said it was better for my sister and I not to know where they were, under the circumstances of distress we were in. I went to Rosamond-street, on the 25th of May - I was in a coach in the street, and could see part of my sofa, as it stood across the first floor windows - I saw sufficient of it to know it - it stood on its feet under the window; the defendant had given me his address at No. 11, or 14, Margaret-street, Clerkenwell - my sister went there for me, as the coach could not get there, and being a cripple I could not walk. I saw the prisoner that day at my lodgings, which he had taken for me at Somers-town. I told him we had been about the goods - he was very angry - and said we had no business to go - that I had placed confidence in him, and ought to have waited till he came, without making inquiry. I told him we went to consult with him, but could not find him, for he had given a wrong address; he said he meant to move to the lodging where he had told us. He went to Upper Rosamond-street about the goods - he said he had been there - and if we went to the house again to make inquiry we should be insulted, and that he should remove the furniture; he called next day, and said he had moved them into the Borough, where we could not find them, as it was better for us not to know where they were, for fear of the landlord following them. I thought I had put myself in his power, and dare not be otherwise than on good terms with him; he frequently called, and said they were safe - and on the 23d of June, I applied to him for the keys of the apartment where they were deposited - he said he would talk to me at home, in Jewin-street - told me to make the best of my way home, and he would be there as soon as we were. I and my sister went, and waited about half an hour - he did not come - we went back to Clerkenwell.
Q. When did you see him next time? A. I saw him pass the house in Upper Rosamond-street, where the goods were, but did not speak to him - and did not see him again until I went to Guildhall, before Mr. Alderman Cox, to identify him, after I had preferred this indictment, which was in October. He had not called on me, and I did not know where he was - he never claimed the goods as his in my presence - but on the 25th of May, he made a claim to the people of the house where they were. When he went to take a room to move them to, I gave him a sovereign to pay a week's rent in advance, and while the van was at the door I gave him another. On the 25th of May he made me out a bill of 3l. 5s., and I gave him another sovereign - here is the bill, he wrote it in my presence.
This account was written in pencil, and much obliterated - it contained a charge for rooms 8s. 6d., for men 3s. 6d., for two vans, &c. - the total sum was 3l. 5s. - I gave him a sovereign, leaving a balance of 5s. I paid him 7s., for a lodging he had taken of a woman - but he said that when he took the furniture, her husband would not let them in without a reference - that he sent them to Houndsditch for one, and in the mean time the people next door took them in - this is charged in the bill. He made me a bill on the 23d of June, this is it (looking at it) - he did not deliver it himself - it is in his hand-writing; he was to have met me that day in Jewin-street, instead of which, Mr. Rushberry, his solicitor, sent me a letter. and he sent me a letter, requesting I would attend to Mr. Rushberry's letter. I tore that up. I never sold him any goods whatever - nor ever received any money from him for any thing except lodging, and money I have lent him at times.
The bill delivered to the witness on the 23d of June, was here read - as follows "Miss Lee, Dr. to G. B. Valois, Instructing Miss L - two quarters, 2l. 2s., Miss King, 1l. 1s., Master Staples, 2l. 2s., being employed in instructing pupils from the 10th of April, to the 23d of June, at 10s. a day, 36l. 10s. - total, 41l. 15s."
Q. Was he employed in your school as a teacher, at the rate of 10s. a day? A. He was not; I have but twenty-five scholars, and do not receive as much as 10s. a day for all of them together - not above half that; he was employed to teach French by the quarter in my school - I owed him none of this bill - Master Staples was not to pay me; I have the prisoner's receipt for the money - he wrote it in my presence: (read.)
Mr. Staples to B. G. Valois. - Instructing Masters J. and S. Staples, 1l. 2s.; French Grammars, &c. 8s. 6d. -2l. 10s. 6d.
Received, 25th Dec. 1824, B. G. VALOIS.
Q. In August 1824, did you see the prisoner at all, or did you ever sell him any furniture? A. No; he lodged with me then - several of the articles which I have recovered from Margaret-street, and which he swears I sold him in August 1825, I had not even bought at that time; I bought the bedstead and mattress in April, 1825, and many things which I cannot remember - nearly all the furniture in his attic was bought after August - I have the bills of some of them here - I bought the stair-carpet of Mr. Barber, in Henrietta-street, Covent-garden, the beginning of October - the bedstead of Mr. Richardson of Fore-street; and several of the kitchen articles I bought in September, 1824.
Q. From August to February did he pay you any money for goods by weekly instalments, or in any shape whatever? A. Never a shilling - here are the bills - some of the kitchen furniture was bought on the 25th of October, 1824 - I have no bill of that.
The bills produced being referred to agreed with the dates mentioned by the witness.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. These goods, I take it for granted, have been paid for? A. They have not, unfortunately; I have paid for part of them - I have had some of it four years; I first saw the defendant the latter end of July, 1824. When he took me an apartment at Somers-town, he said he was obliged to pass me as his sister, or they would not let the lodgings but to single men; but that was without my consent; I believethe people took me for his sister for a few days. I remember his telling me he was about taking a house in Jewin-street.
Q. Do you remember saying any thing about the comfort and advantage there would be in you and him living together there? A. I do not; I know he took a house in Upper Clifton-street, Finsbury-square, for he referred to me - I answered the reference; nothing ever passed between us relative to marriage; I never sold him any goods; before I preferred this indictment I charged him with stealing these goods - he was tried here and acquitted, on account of my placing confidence in him.
Q. Do you mean to swear you saw your sofa in Rosamond-street? A. I do not - I thought it was mine, having been told it was there. I positively swear no money has passed between us for these goods, for I never sold them.
Q. Look at this paper, without opening it - is that signature your hand-writing? A. It looks like mine - I think it is - I will not swear that it is, or is not, but I swear I never put my name to any paper given to the defendant but one; I know he can imitate my writing; I never but once gave him a receipt, or any thing of the sort.
COURT. Q. You must know whether it is your handwriting or not? A. It is like mine - well, I will say it is, for it is very much like it (No. 1). I never gave him but one receipt.
MR. BARRY. Q. Here is another (No. 2), is this your writing? A. I know they are not both mine - this is more like mine than the other - I can only speak to one, and I think this one is my writing; I never gave him but one document bearing my name - (looking at another paper, No. 3,) I think this is not my writing.
Q. Now open all three of them, and say are they your writing? A. No, I swear that only one is, and that is No. 3 this was when he was in my apartment, the first time; this signature is mine, and it is the only paper I ever gave him with my name to. I recollect the document and dare say my sister will; I admit putting my name to a document of this sort on the 16th of November, 1824. I now say the signature to No. 2, is not mine; I never gave him a receipt when he left my apartment - nor is the signature to No. 1 mine.
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When you speak of your handwriting, in the first instance, you had not seen the contents? A. No; when I see the documents I know only one can be mine, and on seeing them recollect the one I did sign - I never signed the others; the one I signed is a receipt for two weeks rent, and it is the only two weeks he ever paid me at one time; he wrote the body of it and I signed it; I believe the body of all three are his writing, but he writes two different hands; he did not live with us at Somers-town.


                  HARRIET 
                  LEE
               



            . I assisted my sister in Jewin-street. I attended to the household affairs. The defendant came to lodge there the second time on the 20th of December; when he was there before he had the second floor, at 11s. a-week, but afterwards the attic, at 6s. a-week; his rent was not reduced - he left in January, and called frequently afterwards. One afternoon in April, 1825 (I think) my sister asked him to take an apartment to deposit her furniture; he said he would - I left the room, and heard no more then. I remember the goods being removed; there was a stair-carpet, a bedstead, a mattress, some kitchen furniture, the drawing-room furniture, and all that was in the house - there was a sofa and sofa table - some were moved on Saturday morning, and the rest on Monday. I had bought part of the kitchen furniture myself - it was long after August, 1824 - I think it was in December. I did not hear the defendant give any account where the furniture was placed - he would not tell, nor give us the key; he said he had moved it three miles off; we went to No. 16, Upper Rosamond-street, and saw the sofa across the first floor window - we afterwards had the door forced open - it was not there then. I went to No. 6, Margaret-street, and saw some of our furniture in a van which stood at the door; I followed it to Fleet-market, and recognized the whole of it to be my sister's. The prisoner was there, managing the removal. I saw some of the kitchen furniture which I had bought in December, in the van; also the stair-carpet and bedstead; this was about five weeks after it was moved from Jewin-street. I am certain he had not bought it of my sister - he could not without my knowledge, because I am in constant attendance on her, as she is lame, and unable to go about the house - he never claimed any of it in my presence. He first took the apartment on the 2d of August, 1824, and left on the 16th of November, and on the 17th took his luggage away; he gave up the key, and made no claim to any furniture. - The rooms were let afterwards to two or three people - the second floor was let till we left Jewin-street, and the same furniture in it as when he was there; he never interfered with it. Some part of what he says he paid for, was not bought by my sister till the end of March, or the beginning of April; the bedstead was bought on the 9th of April, 1825 - here is the bill of it - I saw that bedstead in Margaret-street; the kitchen furniture was not bought till December; the prisoner never claimed the goods; he sent a letter to my sister when we were going to law with him, for the furniture - he then made a claim of debt, but not of the furniture. He professed to teach French, but was not engaged at 10s. a-day; she engaged him for one quarter, at a guinea, but found him incompetent. The Masters Staples learned French - I believe their parents paid the defendant for it. I know he got two sovereigns from my sister, and said Mr. Staples was to pay her; I saw her give him a sovereign when he took the first goods away, to pay for the van.
Cross-examined. Q. You are sure the kitchen furniture was moved with the rest? A. Yes. I knew all the furniture which was in the van. The prisoner never had but one receipt for rent, that was on the evening of the 16th of November, when he left. I never heard of his having any other memorandum - he said he owed her two weeks rent, and would not pay her unless she sent up a receipt. I never took particular notice of my sister's writing.
The witness was here shewn the three papers, and stated she thought that numbered two to be most like her sister's writing, but was unable to swear to either of them.
COURT. Q. When the defendant lodged in the second floor was he the only lodger? A. We had lodgers in the first floor, and the back parlour; Mr. Hattersley and Mr. Pearce lodged there. I never heard a word about my sister's being married to him.

            . I live in Rosamond-street. -The defendant took a room there in May last. I saw the furniture brought - a sofa was put by the window; the prosecutrix and her sister came to inquire about it - the sofa could be seen from the ground; I told the prisoner so, and he moved it, and put up blinds. The sofa was taken away by the defendant at eleven o'clock at night. - The other furniture was afterwards taken away by Miss Lee's order. I had told the defendant they had been to demand it - he said it was his, and told me to tell them it was gone away; I said I should not say so till it was gone, and the sooner it went the better; I wished him to stay, as they said they should come on a certain day, and take it by force; he would not stay, but said then that the property was theirs, but he detained it for 41l. 15s.; he called two or three hours after it was gone, and said he should hold my husband responsible for it, as Miss Lee owed him 41l. 15s., and he considered it worth that.
Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not claim it? A. He said they owed him 41l. 15s.; not that he had paid that for it.
MR. LANGDALE re-examined. I received this letter,(which has been sworn to be the defendant's writing,) from a person acting as his attorney; with the bill which has been read. I saw the defendant at Mr. Walter's, in Fleet-market, the latter end of June, or the beginning of July; he said the furniture was his - it was there then.(Letter read.)
"MR. RUSHBURY. - If you think it necessary that I should put in an execution for the furniture, although I am in possession of it, please leave a note, stating the same, this evening. B. G. VALOIS."
MR. BARRY addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant. The three papers produced to the prosecutrix were then read.
No. 1 was a receipt, dated the 28th of December, 1824, for 4l. 10s., for goods sold Mr. Valois, signed M. Lee.
No. 2, a receipt for 10s., being rent due the 6th instant, dated the 5th of January, signed M. Lee.
No. 3 was a receipt, dated the 16th of November, 1824, for rent, and acquitting him of all demands, signed M. Lee.

            . I live at No. 6, Margaret-street, Spafields, and am a printer; the defendant took a first floor room at my house on the 23d of May, at 7s. 6d. a-week, and brought some furniture. I saw Miss Lee about a fortnight after - she asked to see the defendant; he was out; she then claimed the furniture; he sold the furniture in my house that day, and it was taken away.
- DAVIS. I am the last witness's wife. The defendant took the apartment on the 23d of May, and on the 25th (I believe) Miss Lee came, and asked for Mr. Valois - I said I knew no such person, but recollecting myself I thought it might be him; I followed, and told her - she said she had pronounced his name as it should be in French, which was the reason of my mistake; I said he had brought some furniture, and I was displeased at my husband taking him in, as I did not like weekly lodgers; she said what did it matter so that I was paid; she did not say the furniture was hers; she said he was a gentleman, and would pay honourably; she afterwards called, and said he was a swindler - that he had robbed and injured her, but never named the furniture. I was not present when she claimed it of my husband.
DEFENDANT. When I bought the furniture Miss Lee told me not to tell her sister of it; I was to receive part of the rent arising from it while I was in the country, and when I returned my rent was reduced to 6s. a-week.

            . I am a manufacturer
. On the 20th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was walking down Wellington-street


; I had seen the prisoner in the Strand, and I saw him elbowing me again in Wellington-street - I went on to the pay-gate; a gentleman met me and said, "Are you aware that you are robbed?" I then put my hand to my right-hand coat pocket, and missed my silver snuff-box; I turned, and saw the prisoner running away - I cried Stop thief! a waggoner intercepted him; he threw the box into a cart - I said,"Get it out of the cart," which he did, and gave it to me - this is it.

            . I was sitting on Waterloo-bridge, and saw the prosecutor coming up to the pay place; the prisoner was behind him - the moment he got to the gate the prisoner took up his pocket, and took something out; I could not see what it was - I at first thought he was his son, and that he was going to take the halfpence out of his pocket that he should not have money to pay the toll- I thought it was a joke; I then heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner run; the box was taken out of the cart, and delivered to the prosecutor.

 in Fleet-street; the prisoner has been employed by us as a chocolate-maker
 for three or four years past. On the 23d of November our carman found a large piece of hard soap put up in a corner in the cellar just by the prisoner's great coat; we let it abide, to see who would take it away, as things had often been missing; when the prisoner had done his work, he carried his coals down, and put on his great coat; and when going out of the shop we took him into the compting house, and charged him with having a piece of soap in his pocket; in turning his apron aside, there was a quantity of cocoa in his great coat-pocket, and two or three pieces of candle in a paper; in the other pocket was half a pound of chocolate, and two single pounds of lump sugar; we sent for Mr. 
               
                  Hughes
               


             the constable, he found in one of the prisoner's pockets about half a pound, or three quarters, of powder sugar, in the other a large piece of bread, in his waistcoat pocket about half a hundred of nails; I got a warrant to search his lodgings in Stretton-ground, there we found nine pounds three quarters of chocolate, some cocoa shells, coffee, hard soap, sugar, candles, and three linen bags; I brought nothing away but what his wife delivered to us as our property; the chocolate is the same size, and the same panes as ours; the bags I am sure are our property.

            . I saw the soap, chocolate, and sugar taken out of the prisoner's pockets, and other things that have been mentioned; I tied them up, and delivered them to Mr. Hughes.

            . I am constable, I had charge given me of the prisoner at the bar; I found some of these things upon him, and he said he was unfortunate enough to take them all.

             deposed to seeing the things found that were in the prisoner's lodgings.
Prisoner's defence.
I have a relation that belongs to an Indiaman gave me some of the nuts, and the rest I took home as I roasted them; I did take sugar and candle; when God leaves a person, the d - l gets into him.

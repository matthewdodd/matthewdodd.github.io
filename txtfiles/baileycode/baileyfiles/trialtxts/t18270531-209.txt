            . I am an officer. On the 29th of April, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the two prisoners behind Mr. Gilles - Bradbury took the handkerchief from Mr. Gilles' pocket, and handed it to Wigginton, who threw it down three or four yards from the spot - I secured them.(Property produced and sworn to.)
BRADBURY's Defence (written). I had been to Turnmill-street for my father, and was returning to No. 47, Wardour-street, where he works - a man seized me, and said I had taken a handkerchief, but I never saw it.

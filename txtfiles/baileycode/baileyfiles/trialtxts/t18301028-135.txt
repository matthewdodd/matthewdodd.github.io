. The prisoner is my daughter-in-law, and lodged in the same house with me - she has been in three or four places, but nobody would keep her; on the 11th of October I lost from the room I and my wife sleep in, a jacket of my son's, and a handkerchief of mine; the prisoner returned the same evening, and my wife accused her of it - she denied it, but my wife found the duplicate in the prisoner's box.

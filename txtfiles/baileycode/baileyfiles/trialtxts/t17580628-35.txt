            . The prisoner at the bar was my servant
 about eight weeks: I left him in care of my house and shop, the watch was in a drawer, he took it, and went away with it. I took him some time after, and he acknowledged he had taken the watch, and said it was at his sister's: the constable went and found it. (produced in court and deposed to.)

            . I am constable; I heard the prisoner own this watch to be the property of Mr. Grant.
Q. Did he say how he came by it?
Rison. No, he did not.
Prisoner's defence.
I was servant to Mr. Grant; he left me in care of the shop, and things in it, but not the watch. I was got fuddled, or I had not took it.

The prisoner took a piece of Tammy out of our warehouse, I heard him confess it, I went to hear the examination, knowing this man had taken several things as a porter; as soon as I went in, this Cole that apprehended him told me that he had got my tammy, and that it was at Mr. Townsend's, the pawnbroker's; we went before Justice Wilmot, and these things were brought there; the prisoner acknowledged he took it; it is my tammy.

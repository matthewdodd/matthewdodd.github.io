, and live in Great Ormond-street


; I had had my till attempted on Monday night, and last night I saw the prisoner go out of my shop- I ran after him, and took him with this 19s. 6d. - I had seen my till all right a few minutes before; no one else could have taken it - he must have crawled into the shop on his hands and knees.

            . I am a watchman. I was going by, and saw the prisoner behind the counter with his hand in the till - I did not know he was doing wrong till I heard the prosecutor call Stop thief! he ran out, jumped over the prisoner, and I took him - I found the greater part of the silver in this bag.

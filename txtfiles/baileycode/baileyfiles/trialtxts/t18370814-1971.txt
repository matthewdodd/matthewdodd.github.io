FREDERICK WILLIAM LAURENCE

GEORGE FORSTER
. I was coming over London-bridge, and saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor—I saw him take the handkerchief from the pocket—the prosecutor turned round and caught hold of the handkerchief and the prisoner—a gentleman came up and sent the officer, who took the prisoner into custody.





WILLIAM FLETCHER
. I am an officer. I was returning from the Southwark side of the bridge, and saw a crowd of people on the City side—I found the prosecutor holding the prisoner, and said he had taken his handkerchief from his pocket—I took him with it.

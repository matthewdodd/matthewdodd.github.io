             (police-constable N 71). I was in Wilmer-gardens, on the 23rd of May, about four o'clock in the morning - I saw the prisoner coming across some palings with some canvass, which he said he picked up in the yard - I was looking at it, and some person in the yard said, "Never mind, Tom, it is all right" - in an hour afterwards, I saw the prisoner burying something in the field - I went to look, and found it was this crow-bar - in the afternoon, I took the prisoner - this is the bar, the canvass is lost.

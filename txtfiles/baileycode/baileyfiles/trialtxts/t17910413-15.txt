                  EDWARD
                   WYLDE
               



             sworn.
I have a coal-wharf
 in Town-lane, Upper Thames-street; on the 7th of April I saw my servants
 load sixty-three sacks to go to Mr. Kinloth's, Oxford-road; John Hill was to drive one waggon, and one 
               
                  Edward
                   Barker
               



             the other.
- SHARP sworn.
I was standing, about six in the morning, at the end of King-street, I observed two men standing opposite the Green Man and Still, loaded with coals; I then saw the prisoner Hill, and Barker, take each of them a sack, and walk down the road towards Queen-street, I followed them, and saw Yostus conduct them to a house where he lodged, they went in with the coals, and came out with the sacks empty; they staid in two or three minutes.
How do you know it is Yostus's house? - Because some of my men lodge there; Yostus came out with them, and the carmen walked in the middle of the road, and Yostus on the pavement, up as far as Bond-street, and then they joined in company together; when they came out of the house, the two men went back to the waggon, and put both the empty sacks into the waggon, where they took them from; they were both taken from the first waggon; I took my horse, went to Mr. Wylde in Thames-street, and informed him, and went back to Tyburn-turnpike to Mr. Kinloth's, and I saw the men there, and the coals all shot.
Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel, to Mr. Wylde These coals you have been speaking of were loaded over night? - They were.
Do you know, from your own knowledge, how many number of sacks were put into the waggon? - I cannot say to my own knowledge, but I am certain all the coals put into those waggons were the property of my brother Mr. 
               
                  John
                   Wylde
               



            .
Did you count the sacks? - I did not.
In whose waggons were they put? - In my waggons.
Hath Mr. Wylde any partners in his business? - No.
When were these coals loaded? - On Tuesday evening.
They were loaded on Tuesday evening, staid in the waggon all day Wednesday, until Thursday morning; do you know whether any were taken out? - I do not know.
Do you know whether any were added to that number? - I do not; all I know is, that the coals put into these waggons were the property of my brother.
Mr. Peatt to Sharp. You saw some waggons in Oxford-road? - I did.
Do you know who they belong to? - They were wrote on the front of it, I pretty near can recollect, 
               
                  John
                   Wylde
               



            , Crown-lane, Upper Thames-street.
How far might you be from Yostus, when you see him come out to the carmen? - Half the width of Oxford-road.
It so happened, that Yostus, and the men with the coals on their backs, went the same way; was you at the time the men went in with the coals in the house? - I was not.
Do you know whether any conversation took place between Yostus and the bearer of the coals? - I did not.
Then he was only simply Will with the Whisp walking before them; they did not keep together, I think, you say? - He took a different direction when he saw me.
How is it you happened to know he took a different direction when he saw you? - Because he had the appearance of being confused.
That is, you imagine so; you had nothing but his external appearance to judge of? - Nothing.
They joined again a little distance after that? - They did.
And then Yostus went about his business, whatever it might be? - I know nothing about that.

Then the fact is, you do not know who those coals were delivered to? - I do not, I only saw them carried into that house conducted by Yostus.
Did you know who those coals belonged to, that were taken out of the waggon? - Not till Mr. 
               
                  Edward
                   Wylde
               



             told me.
Then whether or no they might not be put in by the way, you do not know? - No, I do not.
Then for aught you know, these two waggons might have been the property of some other person.
Court to Wylde. Do you serve any body with coals in Queen-street, where this gentleman describes the two sacks to have been taken in? - No, I do not.


                  WILLIAM
                   LEVI
               



             sworn.
The prisoner Yostus lodges at my house, and has done for this half year.
Did you order coals to be brought to you on the 7th of April? - No.
Did you receive any coals on that day? - No.
Was any brought into your house? - I cannot positively say; I saw nothing, I was in bed.
Court. Let me put you in mind of your situation: a man lodges with you, and stands charged here with receiving stolen goods, and these goods, evidently the property of Mr. Wylde; remember you stand here in a very intricate situation yourself? - I heard somebody go down stairs, I was ill in bed, in the morning early, I cannot positively say what time.
Mr. Peatt. You have a good many lodgers in your house? - I have, about eleven.
They have not all separate places for their coals? - They generally keep them in their own rooms; there is a vault in the cellar for the first floor, and one for the second floor.
Court to Levi. When was you first informed of this? - Not till Mr. Sharpe informed me.
Where did you see the coals? - I did not see the coals at all.
When you heard of this, had not you the curiosity to go and look if any coals had been brought in or no? - I did not, I did not like to bring myself into trouble.
Court. I think you went the only way to bring yourself into trouble; is this man a lodger at your house? - He is, and finds his own goods.
What part of the house does he lodge in? - In the kitchen.
Court to Sharp. Have you seen whether there had been any coals fresh put down into that cellar? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock the same day, when the two Mr. Wyldes came up to my house, we went down to the cellar, and there was the appearance of two sacks of coals fresh shot.
Did you see the landlord of the house? - I did, I told him particularly of it; but I believe he did not go down to see it.
Mr. Peatt. How do you know it was Yostus's apartments where the coals were seen? - His wife told me they were his coals.
Now if they had been carried into that house, and you had been shewn a quantity of coals, without this information, should you have known there were two sacks? - I should, I am very well used to them.
PRISONER HILL's DEFENCE.


                  Edward
                   Barker
               



             and I were loaded with five chaldron of coals, I was the last of the two, about one hundred yards behind him; when I came up to him near Ball-street, he said, take a sack and follow me; I certainly did unadvisedly take a sack, and follow; but I received none of the money, nor should I know the house again.
PRISONER YOSTUS's DEFENCE.
Barker came to me as I was in the stable, and asked me if I was going home, I went home, and he brought two sacks of coal in.
Hill called three witnesses who gave him a very good character; and his master Mr. Wylde said, he believed he would not have done this action, if it had not been for the person that was not taken.

Yostus called one witness to his character.

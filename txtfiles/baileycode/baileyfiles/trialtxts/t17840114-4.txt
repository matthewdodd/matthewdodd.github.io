             sworn.
On the 9th of December I had information that some of Mr. Skutt's things was in Bethnall-Green, I went there and found one shirt in the prisoner Newton's house, the prisoner Newton was not at home, I waited for his coming home, I then took him to the magistrates, he said it was brought to him, he said he would go and shew where he had them from, and I sent him with two other officers, and they went and found the other prisoner, when they brought the other prisoner in, I made him take off his shirt, which shirt is here.
(The shirt deposed to by

                   Gunhouse
               



            , which was found in Newton's house.)
Mr. Keys, Council for Prisoner Newton. Is there any mark on it? - No, I swear to it, I made it.
To Yardley. When you came to Newton's house you say you found a shirt? - I found this.
He was not at home? - He was not.
He said it was brought to his house? - Yes.
For what purpose? - He said he had it to wash.

             sworn.
On the 9th of December I had information, and I went down to a house in Salt-petre Bank, and Newton went with me, I went to the house, and took this Norburge at the house where Newton directed me, I brought him out, and according to the information I had, I said, they wanted him, for a robbery; he said, the things were not his, and he came there to ask about a pair of shoes that he had brought to be mended. I brought him to Justice Wilmot's, and the shirt was taken off his back, he said, it was his own and he had had it months; I shewed it to Mr. Skutt's servant, and she said it was her master's. I asked him where he lodged, he told me at No. 8, Back-alley, St. Catherine's: I went to his lodgings, and there I found a pair of breeches, two pair of stockings, and one glove, they have been in my custody ever since.
(Produced, and the breeches and stockings deposed to by the prosecutor; the shirt shown to

                   Gunhouse
               



            , and deposed to by her as she made it; the glove deposed to by Smith which was left in the coat pocket, he having the fellow to it.)
PRISONER NORBURG's DEFENCE.
I have had them two pair of stockings a long while, the woman that washed for me is not here, I bought the shirt, the breeches, and the handkerchief in Rosemary-lane; in the public fair.
Court to Gunhouse and Smith. Did you hear any noise in the night? - No.
Court to Jury. There is no circumstance that affects the prisoner Newton with the knowledge of this being stolen; the crime of burglary consists in breaking open a house by night, that is when it is so dark that the lineaments of a man's countenance cannot be seen, either with intent to steal, or actually stealing same property thereout, where it is laid for actual stealing: but it is accessary that the house should be broke open in the night; now the maid servant went to bed in the night, and did not get up till it was clear day-light; and in all cases you know, if it be a matter indifferent as to the whole of the charge whether the prisoner is guilty or innocent, the presumption is ever in favour of innocence; if, therefore, you think the house was not broke open in the night time, the prisoner must be acquitted of the burglary, for people are not to be found guilty upon conjecture.
Prosecutor. I have a watchman here that saw a light in my house about 3 o'clock in the morning.
Mr. Justice Ashurst. They cannot call him now.
Mr. Justice Heath. I cannot call him rioty, it is a dangerous practice, I have no doubt in this particular case, but the practice itself is a dangerous practice, if after a Judge has made observations on the defect of evidence, then the prosecutor is to come and supply that defect.
Court to Jury. Gentleman, as to the captain part of the charge you have no clear account that the house was broke open in the night as to the other part of the charge which consists of his stealing these things, of that you have such stronger evidence, they were took the 2d, they were found in his possession the 9th, and when called to give an account of them, he gives such an account as is not consistent with truth; that is a strong circumstance that he was the person that stole them; If you think there is no evidence to convict him of the breaking by night, you will acquit him of the burglary, and find him guilty of the larceny only; or, if you think he is not guilty generally, you will acquit him of the whole of the charge.

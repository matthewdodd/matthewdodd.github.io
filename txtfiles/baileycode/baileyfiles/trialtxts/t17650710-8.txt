            . About a month ago, I and

             had lost our scythes: he, in looking for his own, found mine, in the possession of the prisoner: he pretended he bought it, but could not tell of who; (produced and deposed to.)

            . When I first found it on the prisoner, I asked him if he would sell it: he said, Yes; and asked four shillings for it: after it was owned, he offered to give us some beer to make it up.

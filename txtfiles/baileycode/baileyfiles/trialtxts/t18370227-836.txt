JOHN ALLEN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
2nd of March, 2 blankets, value 5s., the goods of 



George Fenner.






GEORGE FENNER
. I keep the Angel inn, at Highgate. The prisoner slept at my house on the night of the 1st of March—I saw him come down about half-past six o'clock next morning into the bar, with two bundles—he had a glass of rum, which he paid for—in consequence of what occurred I sent my servant up to examine the bed, and then sent my pot-boy after him.





THOMAS BATCHELOR
. I am pot-boy at the Angel. I saw the prisoner leave the house—I went after him, and found him at Hampstead—I said, "Well, my friend, have you any thing belonging to my master?"—he said he had—I took one parcel in my hand, and found a blanket in it—I met a policeman, and gave him in charge, and another blanket was found in his other bundle, with part of another.





RICHARD NEELD
 (police-seryeant S 3.) On the 2nd of March the prisoner was given into my custody—I took him to the station-house—Batchelor produced a blanket to me, and I found another in the prisoner's bundle—there was part of a blanket which is not claimed—the prisoner said he took the blankets from the prosecutor on purpose to be transported, to go to see his son at Sydney—I found no money on him.

Primer. I was intoxicated, and did not know what I was doing—I was at the battle of Vittoria, and got a wound in my head.Witness. He was sober.





ELIZABETH SPENCER
. I am servant to Mr. Fenner. These are my master's property, and were on the bed the prisoner slept in that night.




GUILTY
. Aged 59.—


Transported for Seven Years.

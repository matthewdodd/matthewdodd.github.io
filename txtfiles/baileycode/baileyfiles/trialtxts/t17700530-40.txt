            . My hat was hanging up in the passage in the hall, opposite the back parlour door, that was open on account of the men cleaning the common shore; the hat might be seen when he came opposite the door. I was in the kitchen below stairs between eleven and twelve, on the 22nd of May. I heard a foot lightly go in the passage. I made all the haste up I could. When in sight of the hall-door, I saw the prisoner go out with something under his arm. I went into the passage and missed the hat; I pursued, and called, stop thief! He turned down North street, facing St. John the Evangelist's. I saw him drop the hat; I took him before he was out of sight. (The hat produced; a livery-hat, and deposed to as the property of his master)

I know nothing at all about it. I am a waiter

He called Eliz Pollard and Tho. Matthews, who said, they never heard any bad character of him.

            . The prisoner came to my house on the 27th of November, and took a room of me, at half a crown a week. On Tuesday following a gentlewoman came to me, and told me the prisoner had robbed her lodgings, and bid me take care of her. On that I went up into her room; she was gone out. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I got a constable, and went and searched after her; we took her at a public house; she was very drunk, and could say nothing that night; we found the things at three pawn-brokers.

            . I am a pawn-broker; I did not take any thing in of the prisoner; my mother I believe did. I told the justice so at the time I was before him, but his Worship bound me over, and not her.

I did not mean to defraud them of any thing; I took them in order to get work, because I was destitute.

            . I live in Coventry Street, St. James's.


 The prisoners came to my shop on the 13th of May, under pretence of buying some handkerchiefs: they gave me a great deal of trouble, and none would please them. After they had been gone out of my shop about two minutes, I missed some handkerchiefs. I pursued and overtook them at about 150 yards distance from my shop. I accused them; they denied it, and used me with very ill language. I brought them back, and under Strutt's cloak were found these handkerchiefs, my property. ( Producing five silk handkerchiefs.)

            . I saw Mr. Waterman take this piece of handkerchiefs from under Strutt's cloke.
The prisoner's said nothing in their defence.

            . I am the wife of John Heath. I live in White Conduit-fields


. On the 3rd of September I hung a rug and table-cover on the rails of my door while I was sweeping the passage; the prisoner had been standing about the street some time - I saw him stoop down at the door, as I thought, to catch the cat; in a minute my neighbour said, "That man has taken your things" - I pursued and saw him with them on his right arm - I said,"Put them down" - he threw out his left hand, and struck me across the throat, but I still pursued, calling Stop thief! and he was secured.

            . I was standing at my window; I heard a cry of Stop thief! - I saw the prisoner running with the things - I pursued him down Copenhagen-street, and took him.

            . I am an officer. I heard the alarm; I took the prisoner - I found on him two keys, a screwdriver, and a knife.

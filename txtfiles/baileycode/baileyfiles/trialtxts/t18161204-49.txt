            . On Thursday the prisoner came into Mr. Smith's, St. Martin's le-Grand, to beg, and I gave him a penny. On the Friday morning he came in again, and asked if I knew a person of the name of Thomas. I said, no, and was going into the counting-house; I saw him take up the muff and run away. I ran after him, and overtook him with the muff. I took it from him.

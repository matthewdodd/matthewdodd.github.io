ANDREW BESSELL.
On the 23rd of December I was in Newgate-street, a little after six o'clock in the evening—I had a handkerchief in my pocket—I felt a tug at my pocket, and instantly turned round, sew the prisoner make off, and drop the handkerchief—I pursued, and overtook him—the policeman came and took him—I never lost sight of him—this is my handkerchief—(examining one.)

Prisoner. Q. Can you take your oath you saw me take the handkerchief? A. No, but I saw you drop it, and run away—you were close to me when I turned round—I did not say I had a doubt of him—I said I did not wish to prosecute him on account of the inconvenience.

Prisoner's Defence. It was very wet—I was running along, and the prosecutor ran and took me—he was there about ten minutes, and a gentleman brought the handkerchief up to him—the prosecutor had a doubt of me, and was willing to let me go.

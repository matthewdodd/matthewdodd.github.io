ELIZA KING
. I live with my father on Clerkenwell Green. Two pairs of trowsers hung on the rail at his door on the 8th of October—I saw the prisoner pull them off the rail, and roll them up in a piece of coarse cloth and run away—I called my father—the prisoner was brought back by a gentleman, with the trowsers.





JOHN HENRY DONALDSON
. I was passing down St. James's Walk, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running with a bundle before him—I ran after him, and saw him throw the clothes on the step of a door—I took him—I brought him back, took them up, and gave him and them to Mr. King.





GEORGE KING
. I am a silversmith. These are my trowsers-my daughter called me—I gave the alarm immediately, and the prisoner was brought back.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going round Clerkenwell church-yard, and the witness met me and said I was to go with him.

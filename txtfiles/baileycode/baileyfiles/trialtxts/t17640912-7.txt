            . I keep the Sun-alehouse, in Devereux-court




. The prisoner was my servant
 for about ten weeks: I often missed money for a month or six weeks last past. On the 31st of last month, I missed a good deal of silver out of my till; and I missed some also on the 4th of this inst. then on that day, I put three shillings, marked with a cross and a B. and one sixpence marked F. B. into the till, with other money, that amounted to 5 s. 6 d. In the morning, on the 5th, when I got up, the money was all there, and in about two hours after, 3 s. 6 d. of it was gone: I having a strong suspicion of the prisoner, by her buying herself new things, I got a constable, and searched her: there was the marked six-pence found upon her, and she had just paid a lodger in the house, named 
               
                  William 
                  King 
               



            , two shillings, which were the two shillings I had marked. (Produced in court and deposed to. Inspected by the court and jury.) Then she confessed she took it out of my till.

I did take the money out, and I beg pardon of my master.

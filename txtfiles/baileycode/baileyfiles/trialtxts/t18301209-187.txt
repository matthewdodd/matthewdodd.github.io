WILLIAM CLAPP. I live with my father, in Kingsland-road


. On the evening of the 30th of November I was at my father's door, and saw the prisoner; he passed and looked very hard at me - I watched him, and saw him cross to Mr. Champion's door; he unpinned these stockings, which were hanging at the door - I called my father's apprentice, who ran after him; I saw the prisoner fold up the stockings and put them under his coat.

            . I am the officer. My wife told me the prosecutor had been robbed of some stockings - the prisoner had then got into his own house; one of the boys knocked at the door, and when I got in I found these stockings under the bed, and no one but the prisoner was in the room.

            . I went after the prisoner - he looked at me, gave a sudden turn, and went through a public-house.
WILLIAM CHAMPION. I am the owner of the shop
. These are my stockings - I missed two like them, but it is impossible to swear to a stocking.
Prisoner's Defence. They took one boy first, and then came and took me.

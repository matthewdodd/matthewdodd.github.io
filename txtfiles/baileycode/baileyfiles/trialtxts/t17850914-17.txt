I live at St. Mary, Stratford-le-bow


, my house was broke open on Sunday the 17th of July last, I found it broke open when I came down, about four o'clock in the morning; I and my wife were up last the night before, and I saw all secured as usual when I went to bed, which was about ten; a little before four I awaked, and my little girl who lays in a little bed by herself, says da, there is somebody below stairs, I heard the foot of a man; immediately I got up an end in the bed to awake myself, and rubbed my eyes to be sure I was awake; in about five minutes I heard something go, I believe it was the lock of the foredoor, that caused me to get up, I went down in my shirt, I had a loaded pistol on the mantle-piece, I went down stairs, and saw by the light through the crevice, that the house had been broke open, it was then day-light, I saw by the light that the window had been open, I unbolted the stair foot door, and that minute I saw the prisoner jump out of the window of the back kitchen; I just saw the back part of him, I turned directly, and I said to the prisoner, what you are there, you rascal, I have got you, have I? he directly pointed a pistol at me, which terrified me, being in my shirt, as it would any man, I suppose, with the heart of a horse; immediately I run from the window, as another man I suppose would do in my situation, he jumped into the window after me, I said for God's sake do not shoot me; but b - r my eyes, says he, if I do not, he snapped the pistol at me, but it did not go off, I believe it was nor loaded; when I turned myself round, I saw the fire flash from the pistol, and it did not go off; I immediately caught hold of his collar, and up with my fist and knocked him down on the floor, I believe he and I were upon the floor for four minutes, and he cutting me over the head in twenty places with the pistol during the time, and I wrenched it out of his hand; I believe I lost two quarts of blood that morning at the least, he then turned round and jumped out of the same window that he came in at; while we were upon the floor, I cried out murder, murder to my wife, and said, bring down the loaded pistol from my apartment; she opened the window, and cried out murder, I immediately opened the door, and saw where he chucked this pistol, I run down our court in my shirt, as I was to alarm the town, I pursued the gentleman the back way, I run up to the Black Swan corner, after that I gave information of the gentleman to every person I saw, and at last I was coming home and I met a man who said he is caught; he was taken in about four or five minutes; I am sure he is the man, I have no doubt but he is the man; this is the pistol, I believe it was not loaded, except the balls and powder dropped out, it appeared to have been loaded; I lost one silver tea-spoon, one muslin handkerchief, and a pound of ham the gentleman wanted for breakfast; they were found in the garden all but the silver spoon, which was found upon him, there were two or three large spoons if he had looked where they had been.
Prisoner. You are positive I am the man? - I am sure of it.

My little girl heard a noise, my husband went down, and after he went down I heard him say, what are you there, I have got you at last, and I thought it was a cat that I had fastened into the house; and I heard my husband say, for God's sake do not shoot me! but what the prisoner said I cannot tell, then my husband called out murder! murder! bring down the pistol; I threw up the sash, and called out murder! then I came down stairs, and the prisoner was going out of the back window: I saw the man, and very well know the prisoner to be the man; he was as near me as I am to your lordship, there was a good light, his back was towards me then, I never saw his face, he never was out of sight, I know him to be the same man by the dress, he had his hair tied behind with a bit of string, and a brown coat and striped trowsers: he was taken to the watch-house, and brought back; there was one silver tea-spoon, one morning handkerchief, a piece of raw ham, and this knife he took to the window, that I scrape the gridiron with.

On the 17th of July in the morning, sometime about the hour of four or something after, I cannot tell particularly the time, being in the room where I lodge, I heard a great cry of murder in the next house, I live next door to the prosecutor, I run down stair as fast as I could, and got into the back yard adjoining Robert Rudd's yard, and there I saw upon a little shed in Robert Rudd's yard, the prisoner making up the shed to a high wall, seeing him all over blood, I thought there must be something extraordinary, and hearing Mrs. Rudd say something. I pursued him over the shed up the wall; I never lost sight of him, only so far as when he jumped over a wall, the wall hid him till I got upon it; I immediately pursued him as fast as ever I could, I thought he got the advantage of me, but at last I took him, after a considerable struggle, and

I live at Bow, next door but one to the prosecutor's; I heard the cry of stop thief! between four and five in the morning, I saw Mrs. Rudd looking out of window, and crying murder; she told me which way the prisoner was gone, and I followed him; when I first saw him, he was down, and

             atop of him keeping him down, and I helped to take him; at the time I had him against the door, there was a teaspoon lay beside the pales, where he had been, at Noakes's, at the back door.
Is there any body that saw him drop it? - No, Sir, I believe not, but it was close by the prisoner.
(The spoon deposed to.)

             sworn.
On the 17th of July last, in the morning between four and five o'clock, just turned of four, my wife waked me with the cry of murder, I dressed me and went down; I went up the court where the prosecutor lives, which is behind my house, I found the prosecutor's door open and nobody in the house, but I found a hat half full of blood, which was the prisoner's hat, as he owned before the justice, and it was in the prosecutor's fore-room below stairs, I took this knife from him, which the prosecutor's wife owned.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going to Stratford, and coming through Bow, I heard a great noise, and coming across the field this man seized me, and said I must go with him, he knocked me down, and cut me over the head.




               GUILTY. Of stealing, but not of the burglary
            .
Court to Prisoner. You have been fortunate in the circumstance which, in point of law, intitled you to be acquitted of that part of the charge of this indictment which would have affected your life, if the jury had thought themselves warranted to bring in a general verdict of guilty; for your conduct was such, it would in all probability have excluded all hopes of mercy from your Sovereign, and certainly as far as depended on me I should have thought you most clearly a person proper to be made a public example of; for you were not only guilty of the most atrocious offence, but after the fact committed, and when you had an opportunity of making, or at least attempting to make your escape, not content with that you returned again, and, as far as lay in you, endeavoured to deprive the prosecutor of his life: under these circumstances therefore there could not be a more fit example of public justice than you; but the jury have justly and rightly acquitted you of that part of the charge, and I am perfectly satisfied with their doing so; for however acrocious the crimes of offenders may be, it is our duty to administer the law with mercy and justice; but I cannot do my duty to the public, without passing the severest sentence upon you that the circumstances of your case will admit, which is, that you be




               Transported to Africa for seven years

            . On the 30th of January I was in Fleet-market, I keep a green-stall, I lodge in Turnagain-lane; about half an hour after six in the evening I was sent for home; I saw the prisoner sitting on the garret stairs stopped by 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bill 
               



            , all the things laid in the indictment were in her lap; I have known the prisoner many years.

                  Bill 
               



            . I lodge in the same house on the second floor, where the prosecutor lodges; I went up stairs about half an hour after six; I saw his room door open; I presently saw the prisoner upon the garret stairs; I desired my little girl to call out from the window for Mr. Gardener; he and his wife came; the prisoner had these things upon her; (the things produced in court and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I found these things on the stairs, and I was going to bring them down to ask who they belonged to, and they would not let me.

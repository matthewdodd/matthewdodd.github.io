            . I took her into custody, on the 30th of March, at the back of the prosecutor's house. I told her it was for robbing her mistress. On the way to the watch-house, I asked her if she knew Sowerby, a pawnbroker - she said she had pawned several things there, but she denied having pawned the spoon.

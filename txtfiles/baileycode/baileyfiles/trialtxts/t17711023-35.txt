            . I am a carman. I had been to Mr. Kenton's to bring home an iron-bound hogshead and an iron-bound barrel on the 20th of September. I put them out of my cart at the end of the lane, and went to put my horses into the stable; I met the prisoner rolling the hogshead by my master's door, about forty yards from where I had left it. I pursued him; when he saw me, he run away; I got up to him and secured him; he desired I would let him go, and he would roll the hogshead back again and treat me with some beer. I took him to my master, who charged a constable with him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming along and found the case in the road; I set it up against a post till the owner might find it; I did not roll it twenty yards. I have sent for my friends; they are not here. I am a cooper.

            . I am a servant
, and live in Russel-street, Covent garden; my box was locked and left as my brother's in Duke-street, St. James's-square


, five months ago; there were my wearing apparel in it, the things mentioned in the indictment were part of them; the prisoner lived with a lodger there on the second floor. I missed the thing, mentioned last Saturday night; and a stomacher of mine was found in the prisoner's box, among her dirty linen. She was taken up upon suspicion; and, before justice Fielding, she owned she had pawned the gown at Westminister, and she produced the ruffles, and cardinal there.
Q. from Prisoner. Did you not tell me 40 times, that if I would confess any body else, I should be set clear?
H.Taylor. No, I did not; I do not know that any-body else was concerned in it.
The pawnbroker deposed the prisoner pawned the gown to him on Monday the 11th of December.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

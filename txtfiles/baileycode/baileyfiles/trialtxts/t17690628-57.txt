            . On the fourth of April I lost four bushels of tares in a sack, out of a lighter on the river Thames






. On the first of June, 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Harris 
               



             was detected in stealing four bushels of malt; I saw him in a boat with the sacks marked with my name at length. At that time he confessed he had stole this sack of tares, and sold it to Mr. More for six shillings. More was taken up, and he owned he gave the tares to his pigs. The prisoners then quarrelled, and accused one another.
Harris's Defence.
I was in liquor. I rowed a man to Wapping Old Stairs, and somebody took my boat away, and I found my boat with four sacks of malt in her.
Both 

               acquitted

                  Reuben 
                  Harris 
               



             was a second time indicted for 


               stealing 16 bushels of malt, value 45 s. and four hempen sacks, value 4 s. the property of 
                     
                        John 
                        Dalrymple 
                     



                  , the same being in a certain lighter, on the navigable river of Thames
            , June 1

            . On the 31st of May I took in a quantity of malt on board a lighter, in all there were 109 quarters and six bushels. I could not get through bridge to deliver them to the brewer. I made the barge fast to her moorings, and about half an hour after one the next morning. I was called out of bed by 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Dunkin 
               



            , one of his majesty's officers in the Customs; he told me he had detected a man with four sacks of my malt. I went down immediately, and found 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Harris 
               



             in a waterman's boat. He was standing upon four sacks of my malt. The sacks were marked with my name at length in red. (Produced in Court, and deposed to.) I asked him how he came by that malt. His answer was, a man at St. Catherine's Stairs's had hired him to carry it down to Cherry Garden. I asked him to whose house; he said he did not know, but there was a man waiting there for it. After some prevarications I told him he must expect no favour; he was the first I had caught, and I having been robbed several times, I would punish him. At last he said, It is a folly to deny it, the fact is too plain, and go I must, and I'll tell you the truth. He then said, It is your malt; I stole it out of your barge. I'll go with you and shew you which barge it is. He went with me in the same boat, and shewed me the particular place in the barge where he took them from, and there they were missing. I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said he was employed by 
               
                  John 
                  More 
               



            , and he confessed the same before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            .
Prisoner's Defence.
He promised he would get me clear if possible.
Prosecutor. I never made him any such promise: I never thought of it. I was determined to prosecute him.




               Guilty. 39 s.
            

(M.) He was a third time indicted for 


               stealing one four bushel hempen sack, value 15 d.
             the property of 
               
                  
                     Robert 
                     Burnett

, and 
               
                  John 
                  More 
               



             a second time for 


               receiving the same, well knowing it to have been stolen
            , June 1

                  Burnett 
               



            . On the first of June Mr. Dalrymple called upon me and told me he had a man in custody that had stole some malt out of his craft, and he had given him an account of 
               
                  John 
                  More 
               



             as a receiver; he knowing I had been a considerable loser of corn, desired I would get a search-warrant against More. I sent one of my servants along with them. They brought a sack to me with my name at length on it.


                  John 
                  Dalrymple 
               



            . I received that sack of Mr. Segwick the constable about the third or fourth of June. It had Mr. Burnett's name at length upon it. At the time More was committed, he sent Mr. Segwick down to his house, and told him this sack was upon the top of his house. I heared Harris confess that he stole this sack.


                  James 
                  Segwick 
               



            . I am a constable for the parish of Mile-End. On the first of June I had a warrant to search the house of More. The door was fastened, a person with me saw a door open, and he got in and catched More getting over a wall from his back yard. Then I began to search. I found nothing in the lower room or the chamber. In the garret we found five bushels of rye in a sack. There was a mark upon it, but no name. We took More to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            . Going along he begged for mercy, but Mr. Dalrymple told him he must expect none from him. Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             was not at home. He was ordered for examination another day. Then More told Mr. Dalrymple he would confess all: he owned to twenty-six sacks in my hearing, that he bought of Harris, and that he knew Harris stole them, and he gave him half the value for them, and said if we looked upon the top of his pantiles, we should find three sacks. I went, but found only two, one of which is this. (Produced in Court, and deposed to by Prosecutor.)
Harris's Defence.
I know nothing of what they talk about.
More said nothing in his defence.

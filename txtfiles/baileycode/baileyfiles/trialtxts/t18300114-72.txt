HENRY HORNBLOWER. I am a cheesemonger
 in Hatton-Wall


. I lost about 9lbs. of bacon on the 17th of December - the officer brought it back, and then I missed it; I knew it to be mine - I know nothing of the prisoner.
EDWARD BELL. I took this bacon from the prisoners in Hatton-garden, about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of December - Jones had it under his great coat; he said Ward gave it him, and Ward said they got it from a woman on Saffron-hill, but they would not go with me to the place.
Jones' Defence. I was going up Hatton-wall, and went to a woman to buy a pennyworth of apples; this boy stood there, and asked me to carry it for him - the officer came and took me with it; I said Ward gave it to me, but I did not know him before.
Ward's Defence. I bought it of a woman for 14d. - this lad said, "It is a cheap bargain;" and I gave it to him to hold while I tied it up in my neckerchief - there were others standing by; I was tired of carrying it.
JONES - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.
WARD - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 14.

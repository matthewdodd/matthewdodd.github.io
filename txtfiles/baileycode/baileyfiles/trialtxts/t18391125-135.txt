 for stealing, on the

JOHN SMART
. I am a tailor, and live in Castle-street, Whitechapel. I had a jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers hanging up by the door, inside my shop—I saw them safe at half-past ten o'clock, on the 22nd of November, and missed them about half past eleven o'clock—these are them—(examining some,)





THOMAS COLLINS
. I keep a public-house in Rosemary-lane. I have seen the prisoner several times come to my house with his brother, who is bigger than him—on the 22nd of November, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner was fitting on a suit of clothes in my tap-room—I said, "I doubt you stole them"—he said he had given 12s. 6d. for them—soon after, he told some person in the tap-room where be took them from—I went to Mr. Smart's, and gave information—the prisoner was taken in my tap-room, in my presence, with the articles—he begged pardon, and said he hoped they would forgive him.

JOHN MADDEN (police-constable H 161.) The prisoner was given into my custody, about a quarter past one o'clock on the 22nd—I found these clothes on him.

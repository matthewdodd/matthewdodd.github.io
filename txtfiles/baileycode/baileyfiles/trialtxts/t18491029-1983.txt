REBECCA HARNETT
. I am single, and live at Hackney. On 20th June, about one o'clock in the day, I was walking with two friends in Hand's-place, Hackney-road, with a small bag on my arm with a brooch, card-case, handkerchief, and smelling-bottle in it—I saw the prisoner following me for ten minutes—he came up, snatched my bag from me, and ran away with it.





WILLIAM STYLES
. I am apprentice to Mr. York, a lath-render, of Hand's-place. I saw the prisoner walking behind the lady—he snatched the hag from her arm and ran away up Spencer's-passage—I am sure he is the man—I had seen him several times before.

Prisoner. Q. How do you know me? A, I have seen you with a gang of thieves several times.

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of October I saw the prisoners in the Strand


, just beyond Temple-bar, I suspected and followed them, and saw Huett force up against a gentleman who stood looking at a procession. Turpin went close behind him. I saw Huett take a snuff-box out of the gentleman's pocket, put it behind and give it to Turpin. I snatched it out of his hand, and with assistance took them both out of the crowd. The gentleman came and claimed the box in their presence, and said his name was

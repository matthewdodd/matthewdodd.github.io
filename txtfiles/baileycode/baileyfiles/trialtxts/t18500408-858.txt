BENJAMIN SMITH
 and 




ANN JOHNSON



, stealing 1 gown, and 2 shirts, value 6s.; the goods of 



Mary Ann White: Johnson having been before convicted.






ALFRED SPICE
 (police-constable, V 47). About half-past five o'clock in the evening of 13th March, I saw the prisoners coming through Vauxhall-gate—they went into the Brixton-road—I saw them at Vauxhall-gate again, a little before eight—I had received information, and stopped Johnson, and told her she must go to the station—I saw something hanging below her gown—she said, "It is of no use; you may as well take it"—I got this gown and two shirts from her—they were wet—they appeared to come from between her gown and petticoat.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLETT. Q. Did not she say that she found them? A. Yes.





WILLIAM GIBBS
 (policeman, V 77). I was with Spice, and saw something drop from Johnson's petticoats on to the ground—Smith picked it up, and she drew it under her dress again—I took Smith, and found a whip on him—he said, "They can't hurt me for the whip, if they do for the other."





MARY ANN WHITE
. I am single, and live at Halstead-street, Brixton-road. This shirt and gown are mine—they were hung up upon a line to dry about four o'clock in the afternoon—I missed them about ten.

Cross-examined. Q. How do you know them? A. I marked them myself.





SAMUEL BRINE
 (policeman, B 33). I produce a certificate (read—Ann Murray—Convicted August 1848, having been before convicted, confined one year)—I was present—Johnson is the person.

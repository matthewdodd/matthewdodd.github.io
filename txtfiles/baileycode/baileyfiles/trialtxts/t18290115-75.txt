            . I met the prisoner on the 29th of December, in the morning, with a basket, carrying a quantity of horse-hair; I took it down, and found this horse-hair, which are the tails and manes of nine horses, all in bunches; I asked if he had cut it off; he said No, he had bought it of a man at Missenden, whom he never saw before; I said "Are you sure you bought it at Missenden?" he said No, between Aylesbury and Missenden, at four o'clock that morning.
HENRY HOWARD. I live at Bovington, in Hertfordshire


. I have five horses, which I put safe into my stable on the evening of the 20th, and the next morning my boy told me they had lost their tails; I fitted this hair to the tails, and am certain it is mine; I believe the prisoner was pretty well known at Watford.

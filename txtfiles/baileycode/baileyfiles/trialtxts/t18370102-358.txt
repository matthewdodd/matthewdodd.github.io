SARAH AUSTIN
. I am servant to Robert Stoddart, of Trinidad-place, Islington. I called the prisoner to take away some dust on the 23rd of December—there was then a silver spoon on the kitchen table—I had seen it five minutes before, and missed it ten minutes after they carried the dust out—this is it.

Prisoner. I found it in the dust. Witness. I am sure it was not there it was in a basin in some gruel in the kitchen.





CHARLES SCOTT
 (police-constable 181 N.) I was sent after the prisoner and the other man—I said to the prisoner, "Have you a silver spoons in your possession?"—he said, "No, I have not, you may search me"—I took him into custody, and in going along he shuffled about, and this spoon fell from his clothes on the pavement—here is the mark of the gruel on it now.

Prisoner. I beg for mercy.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

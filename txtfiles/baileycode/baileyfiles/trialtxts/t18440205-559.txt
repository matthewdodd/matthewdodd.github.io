559. 




HENRY ALFORD
 was again indicted

 for forging and uttering a request for the delivery of goods, with the intent to defraud 



William Chequers.






GEO. FOWLER COLEMAN
. I live at Mr. Chequers's, Blackfriars-road. The prisoner brought this order to me on the 23rd of Dec.—I am sure he is the man—he asked if Mr. Chequers was at home—I said not—he said he would return again in a few minutes, which he did—Mr. Chequers was not in, and I did not let him have the goods—he went away, leaving the order with me—he did not ask for the goods—he produced the order, and said he would come in a few minutes, which he did, and I refused to deliver them—I had seen him before in Mr. Gray's service—(the order was for six brushes, three water brushes, and three spoke brushes; signed, for H. Gray, S. Unwin.)

Prisoner. Q. At what time did I bring the note? A. After eight o'clock on Saturday evening—I did not see anybody with you—the shop was closed, and you gave me the order at the door.





SAMUEL UNWIN
. I have been in Mr. Gray's service. This is not my writing; it is the prisoner's writing—he had left Mr. Gray's employ then—I have no doubt of it being his writing.





HENRY GRAY
. I believe this to be the prisoner's writing—I did not authorize it.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

indicted for embezzlement.




RICHARD CROSS
. I am a saddler, and live in St. James's-street. The prisoner was my errand-boy, and if he received money, it was his duty to pay it to me. On the 13th of March I sent him to receive 1l. 14s. 3d. for me—he did not pay it me, but absconded.





WILLIAM PAYNE

            . I am master of the King George Tilt-boat
 of Gravesend; I went to Mrs. Lancaster's, the Queen's Head in Darkhouse lane


; I went to bed on Saturday the 9th of October, about eleven o'clock; I left the door open for 
               
                  John 
                  Wheeler 
               



             to come to bed; my clothes were on the bed, and my breeches under my pillow and bolster, with money in both pockets, and my watch in my fob; I fell asleep, and in the morning I was disturbed by the drawing my breeches from under my head, but not wakeful enough to detect the person; I fell asleep again; after that Mr. Wheeler awaked me, and said he felt a man's hand on his hand; he jumped out of the bed, we got a light, I examined my breeches, they then lay between my head and my bed's-head, quite visible; my money and watch were gone; Mr. Wheeler took the light and looked round, there stood the prisoner in a corner; I saw my watch taken out of his pocket.

            . I was in bed with Mr. Norwington at the time; my hand happened to lie out of bed, I felt a hand upon mine; I said, hey, who is that, Norwington, there is somebody in the room more than should be; then a man in the next room called and said, here is a thief in the house; I jumpt out of bed, and secured the door, and said we have him here; then one of them held the door while I got a light, and when I came up I found the prisoner stuck up in one corner of the room; I said, you villain, what business have you here; then Mr. Norwington said he missed his watch; I said, do not be uneasy, it is in the room, we have the man here; we searched him, and found the watch in his left-side breeches pocket; all he said for himself was, he did not know how he came there.

            . When they made a noise I came to their assistance, I belong to the same boat; I was just come in from shifting the boat; I was told there was a thief in the house; I went up into the room, my master said he had lost his watch; I observed the prisoner's thigh looked as if he had an apple or turnip there; I clapt my hand upon it, and said, here is your watch; then I took it out; then Mr. Wheeler said he had lost his handkerchief: I pulled the prisoner's shirt out of his breeches, and the handkerchief fell on the floor.
Prisoner's defence.
I found the watch upon the table; I am a seaman, I came there to lie in the house.
Wheeler. The prisoner took a lodging that night about eleven o'clock; we went and rummaged that room he had taken, there was his bed never touched nor tumbled, and his candle burning down in the socket.

            . I keep a public-house
 in York-terrace, St. Marylebone


; the prisoner was footman
 to Mr. Haywood, who lived on the terrace, and had used my house for about twelve months, On the 11th of August, a little before one o'clock he came, went into the parlour, and had something to drink - he was there till twenty-five minutes past four; he then paid for what he had, and came to the bar - he was leaving the house; he then said he wanted to speak to me - the bar door was open - I asked him to sit down, and he walked in; I asked what he wanted - he said he had something to show me - I had a customer to serve; I then walked in, and he unfolded a painting in an unfinished state, and asked if I thought it was his own likeness; I said I could give no opinion of it, and at that moment a gentleman drove up to the door, and called for some wine and water; but previous to that, a customer came and asked for change for a sovereign; I took the silver out of the till, gave him the change, and took a small box which I keep gold in; I put the sovereign into it, in his sight, and put the box in the back part of the till; I then took the wine and water out to the gentleman in front of the door; I stood at the door with a full view of the bar at the time - I had no suspicion of the prisoner; I returned in a minute and a half, and met him coming out of the bar - he said he must wish me good afternoon, as he had promised to be in the City at four o'clock, and away he went; I went into the bar, and he had not left the house a minute before I missed the box, containing four sovereigns and seven half-sovereigns - nobody could possibly have taken it but him, for the bar was full in my view all the time - I met him coming out of the bar door as I went in; I called in a Policeman, and went in search of the prisoner - I left a description of him at the station-house - I have not found any of the property - he was taken on the 27th of September - I could not find him before; he had lived at Lord Brougham's for about two months; I went there to enquire if they knew where he could be found, but could not find him - nobody but him could have taken the property.
Prisoner. Q. Who came to change a sovereign? A. Mr. Harris, who lives at York-gate; you were coming out of the bar as I came from the door; you did not show me your card to state where you were going to live; I have no recollection of seeing it; after the prisoner was committed, he said, on leaving the office, that if he had a pistol, he would blow my brains out; I never threatened his life; I might have said more than I ought, being exasperated.


                  WILLIAM 
                  PIKE
               



            . I am a gentleman's servant out of place - I knew the prisoner when he lived on Yorkterrace; I received information of the robbery, and went to look for him the day it happened, and afterwards in various places, but could not find him. On the 27th of September, I saw him in St. James's-place, and said "Bill! Mr. Hinton wishes to see you;" he said "Mr. Hinton wishes to see me;" I said "Yes, he does particularly;" he said he could not go then, if I would go to Hinton and tell him he would be there at two o'clock; I said Hinton had desired me to take him if I saw him, and if he did not go with me, I would take steps to make him; he said it was impossible, for he had to see Lord Palmerston, and Lady Brougham, and could not disappoint them; I said, I dare say Hinton would satisfy him for his loss of time; I took hold of his arm, and said, if he did not I would give him into custody - he then went with me to Hinton.
Prisoner. Q. Did I make any resistance? A. In the Haymarket, you said you must go to your lodging.
Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent; he knew perfectly well when I left Lord Brougham's, where I was going - he invited me to dinner before I left town - I said I did not think I could come; I called on the Saturday, told him where I was going, and he forced me to stop and dine with him - I produced the miniature; he went to the door, which was only a few yards, and I was not out of his sight; he came back - I met him, and said "Well, Hinton, I have stopped so long, I must go;" he said "Very well, call again if you can before you leave town;" he knew what coaches went to where I was going; I did not go to Grantham till Wednesday; I booked my place on Tuesday, and there was plenty of time for him to inquire at the coach-office; I returned to town, as the lady kept her old servant; I was going to be introduced to Lord Brougham at twelve o'clock for a situation, when the servant out of place came up shabbily dressed, and gathered a mob round me - he said he did not know what Hinton wanted; I said I would be there at two o'clock, but he made me go; I begged him to tell me what Hinton wanted, and in Regent-street, he said he suspected me of taking something from his house - I would not have gone with him if guilty; when I got there, Hinton insulted me - I felt hurt; he said he would fight me, for he could not bring me to justice - I said "You wrong me, take me before a justice," and finding I would not fight, he called in a Policeman; the Magistrate offered to take one person's bail, but having no friend I could not get bail.

Ann Digweed, and stealing 1 half-sovereign, 1 half-crown, and 3 shillings; her property.






ANN DIGWEED
. I am a widow, and live in High-street, Lambeth. On the morning of 4th Oct. I was awoke by a noise while I was in my bedroom, the back room on the first-floor—I got up, lita candle, and went up-stairs to my brother—I said I fancied there were thieves in the house—I went down, and found the doors open, which had been shut the night before about half-past twelve o'clock—I saw a ladder against the back-yard door—I did not then perceive that anything was lost—I afterwards missed the money stated—I went through the shop to get a policeman, and in the shop I found a coat and pair of shoes—the policeman found the prisoner on the roof of the next house—he had one coat on but no shoes—he owned that the shoes in the shop were his.





ROBERT DAVIS
 (policeman, L 102). I found the prisoner on the roof of the next house—I found a pane of glass had been taken out, and a person had got through the sky-light.

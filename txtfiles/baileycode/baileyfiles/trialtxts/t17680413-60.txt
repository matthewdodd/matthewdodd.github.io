            . On the 1st of March I was standing to see the society of ancient Britons pass by, the corner of Bride-lane


; the prisoner came and placed himself against me; I found something at my watch; I put my hand down, and saw my watch in the prisoner's hand; I said, you rouge, you have got my watch; he went to make off; he was taken and carried down to Bridewell; he dropped the watch on the ground when I charged him.

            . I saw the watch on the ground in the crowd, I took it up, and gave it to the constable, (produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing at all of it.

            , junior, sworn.
I received some cups and saucers from the prisoner Allen, she brought some to my master's, Mr. Cotrell, in Shoe-lane, to sell; I asked her if she had any to sell me? she said if I would come to her on Sunday morning she would sell me some. I went and bought some breakfasting tea cups and saucers, gave 4 s. 6 d. for the tea and 5 s. for the breakfast; I delivered them to my father.
Prosecutor. About twelve o'clock I went to Guildhall, from thence to Allen's house, I asked if she had any china to sell? she hesitated a little at first, she said she had some patterns; she shewed me some; she went with me to the Poultry Compter, and she pointed out Fright, and said this is the man who sold me the china, that was Fright. The goods were in the possession of Lawrance and Clark. I have been a very great sufferer, I have lost from 300 l. to 500 l. The prisoner did not lodge in my house. He packs.

Mr. Hewson. I bought a single lot of the same pattern. It is all gone into the country.

Elliott. I know that article, I had some conversation with the prisoner in the Compter, Mr. Wynn was with me. I asked him if any person had any of the goods except Allen? I told him he was in a bad situation; neither I or Mr. Wynn made him any promises.
Mr. WYNN sworn.
He said he had taken but few; he said Mrs. Allen knew they were stolen.

I was servant to Mrs. Allen, I have seen the prisoner Fright two or three times with my mistress. I know nothing about the china, I cannot tell any more.
PRISONER FRIGHT's DEFENCE.
I never sold this woman any china, this is my working dress, and if any body can suppose that I could take six cups and saucers out of the house I am willing to suffer the law.

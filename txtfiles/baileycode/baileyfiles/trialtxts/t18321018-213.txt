            . I lost these boots out of my kitchen in Monmouth-street


 on the 10th of October; I was at home, and saw the prisoner come to the place, unhook the boots, double them up, and put them under his arm; he walked a hundred yards, and the Policeman took him - he threw the boots at me, and struck me with them.

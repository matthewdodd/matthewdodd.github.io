- BROWN sworn.
I am servant to the prosecutor; on Monday evening, the 9th of March last, I was standing at the door, and the prisoner came in, and asked for a penny bason; I went to the back part of the shop, to fetch a bason, and when I returned, I missed the china tea-pot, with a silver spout; I missed neither cups nor saucers; the prisoner paid me a penny for the bason, and went out; I rung for my master, and ran and caught the prisoner by the cloak; she asked me what she had done; she came back, and said she knew nothing of it; by the time I got to the door, my master came down stairs, and me and my master saw the prisoner shoot the property out of her apron on the counter; the things are my master's.

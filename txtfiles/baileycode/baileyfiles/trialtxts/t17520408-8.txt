; on the 12th of last March these pair of silver spurs were hanging near a window, the window was broke, and the spurs taken away; the bell-man coming by saw the window open and called us, I had a suspicion of the prisoner, he having done a bad thing before; I took him up, he would not confess at first, but after some time he did, and said he had hid them under some hay, where we found them. (Produced in court and deposed to: )

            . I took the prisoner up the next morning after the spurs were missing, I heard him confess he took them out of the house, and where he had hid them, and saw them found.

            . I live at Aldgate


. My wife keeps a haberdasher's shop. This piece of ribband was lost out of my shop on the 24th of December. I know nothing of the transaction.

            . I was in the shop between two and three o'clock. The prisoner came in and another person with her, and asked to see some ribbands. I shewed them a drawer of ribbands; the prisoner took up a ribband to look at, and then desired me to hand another ribband to her that was in the window; I shewed it her; she did not like it; she was going out, and I saw this piece of ribband in her apron. I said, young woman, you have a piece of ribband; she seemed confused, and said, no; it is a piece I bought at the next shop. I took it out of her apron, and I have no doubt but that it is the prosecutor's, it is one of the pieces I shewed her.
Prosecutor. She confessed before my lord-mayor, that she took the ribband.

I have nothing to say.

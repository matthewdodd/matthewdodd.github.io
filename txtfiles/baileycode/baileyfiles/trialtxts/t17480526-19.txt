                  Jones 
               



            . On the 17th of April I lost my money.
Q. What business do you follow?
Jones. I am a chairman
.
Q. Do you know the prisoner?
Jones. Yes.
Q. Did this woman take any thing from you?
Jones. Yes; two guineas.
Q. Where was it?
Jones. In Drum-Ally in Drury-Lane


.
Q. Did she take any thing besides the two guineas?
Jones. Yes; 28 shillings in silver.
Q. Where was the money?
Jones. In my breeches-pocket.
Q. What time was it?
Jones. About four o'clock in the morning.
Q. Where had you been with her?
Jones. I was in a house with her; I was in liquor.
Q. Did you ever see her before?
Jones. I never saw her before.
Q. What room was it in?
Jones. Up one pair of stairs, or two pair of stairs; it was there about.
Q. Was there a bed in the room?
Jones. Yes, there were two.
Q. Did you go to bed with her?
Jones. Yes, and I laid my breeches under my head.
Q. So, though you was in liquor, you was so careful as to lay your breeches under your head.
Jones. Yes.
Q. What time did the Prisoner go?
Jones . I can't tell.
Q. When did you miss her?
Jones. I can't tell.
Q. But did she take your breeches as well as the money?
Jones. No, only my money; I had a watch in my breeches, but I got that again by a girl in the house.
Q. Do you chairmen use to carry so much money about you?
Jones. Sometimes we do. Three or four days afterwards I went to the same house to speak to her, and I asked her, whether she took my money? and she said, if I would stay till the next morning, and not take her up that night, she would get a lawyer to give me the money again, or a note for it.
Q. What did you do then? did you take her up?
Jones. Yes.
Q. Did she confess any thing after that?
Jones. No.
Q. Had you your money again?
Jones. No.


                  Mary 
                  Dicey 
               



             . I lay in the same room with the Prisoner, and was in bed with 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Macguire 
               



            .
Q. Do you know any thing of the Prisoner's taking any thing from this man?
Dicey . She waked me in the morning, and wanted me to drink a dram.
Q. Was she in bed with this man?
Dicey. No; she had been in bed with him for some time, and got up and went away, and we had a quartern of liquor, and then we had some small-beer brought up in a punch-bowl, and she said I will go to bed to my husband again; I saw her pull off all her things but her gown, and go into bed; and I saw her upon her knees in the bed.
Q. To whom did she go to bed?
Dicey. To the chairman; I heard the money chink, and she tossed me a shilling.
Q. Did you see her take the money?
Dicey. I saw her take it out of his breeches.
Q. How much did she take.
Dicey. I saw her take some gold, but how much I cannot tell: There was one 
               
                  Ann 
                  Sykes 
               



             in the room, and she asked Sykes whether she should take it all? and she said, yes; and I said to Eliz. Macguire it was very proper to tell the people of the house of it, and so I did.
Q. Are you sure this is the woman that was in bed with the chairman?
Dicey. I am very sure of it.
Q. to Eliz. Macguire. Do you know the Prisoner ?
Macguire. Yes.
Q. Where do you live?
Macguire. We all live together.

Q. Did you see the young woman at the bar take any thing from this Jones?
Macguire. I did not; I drank a dram, and she said she would go to bed to her husband.
Q. And did she go to bed?
Macguire . She did, and pulled off all her things but her gown, and sat up in bed.
Q. Had you any of the money?
Macguire. She tossed me a shilling.
Q. What did she say she gave it you for?
Macguire. Asking your pardon, she said it was for my backside, and two or three more gentlemen. 


               Acquitted of privately stealing from his person, but guilty of the felony to the value of 39 s
            .

             was indicted for 


               stealing on the 18th of August
, a watch, value 3 l., the goods of 
                     
                        
                           Samuel 
                           Smith
                        




                     
                  , from his person
            .


                  SAMUEL 
                  SMITH
               



            . I am a brewer's servant
, and live at No. 6, Little Windmill-street, Golden-square. On the 18th of August, about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I was crossing Long-acre


; I had been waiting at the New Coachmaker's Arms public-house; I was perfectly sober; 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Beck
               



             accosted me, and asked me to take a walk with her - her sister was with her. I told them I would not have any thing to say to them - they then asked me to give them some gin; I said, I did not know that I should; but if gin would do them any good they should have it. I went into a shop with them - I am certain when I went in that my watch was in my fob; they called for three glasses of gin, and handed me one; I put it to my lips but did not drink it. I gave the landlord a shilling to pay for it; he gave me the change, and I put the halfpence in my left hand pocket. I staid there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes looking about, and thought it was a curious place; the girls wanted more gin, which I refused - but I gave them the halfpence. I went out as far as Windsor's the coachmakers' shop, about ten yards from the gin shop. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Beck
               



             followed me out of the house - I told her I would call the watchman if she did not leave me; she did not go; and I got upon the step of Mr. Windsor's door, and told her to go away. I then went on the grating, and she came to me again - her sister was not with her then; I found she was very troublesome, and was feeling the outside of my pocket, and took hold of my watch to secure it - her sister then came out, and they both came round me, and 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Beck
               



             put her hand into my pocket along with my hand. I let go of my watch to take hold of her hand - they then got my watch and ran away; I followed them and stopped 
               
                  Mary 
                  Beck
               



            , and said,
"You have got my watch" -
"Me, you infernal villain" said she; I then turned round to look for the prisoner, and she was gone. I then secured 
               
                  Mary 
                  Beck
               



            , and she was taken to Bow-street, and there discharged - the prisoner could not have taken my watch, if the other had not helped her; I have never seen it since.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you sober - A. Yes; I never was drunk but twice in my life. I went that evening to the Coachmaker's Arm's public-house about eleven o'clock, and stopped there about three quarters of an hour. I had one glass of rum and water there; before that I had been at Mr. Gibbs's and had three-penny worth of oysters, one drink of porter - that might be about half-past ten; I had been before that in a public-house, in Brewer-street, Golden-square - I went there about twenty minutes past nine, and left at ten. I had 6 d. worth of rum and water before that; I have a tap at home, but I do not know whether I had tasted any that night - I had been at work till five or six o'clock, and to the best of my knowledge I did not eat or drink till nine o'clock - I was not at all in liquor. I was not going with them, nor bargaining with them - this girl had her hand in my breeches pocket, they then both ran away. I do not know how long it was before I took the prisoner into custody, it might be an hour; the robbery was committed upon Mr. Windsor's grating, there is a light there; I was rather in a flurry, and hurt to think that I had been robbed. I am certain I could not have mistaken one person for another; when I came back from the watch-house, this girl was a hundred and fifty yards from the spot - she said I was mistaken in the person.

                  BOYD
               



            . I am a watchman - my beat is in Charles-street, Long Acre: I was going my round at half-past twelve o'clock, and heard watch called; I went to see what was the matter, and Smith gave me a woman in charge, not the prisoner - the prisoner was not there; I thought Smith perfectly sober, but he seemed flurried.


                  REECE 
                  THOMAS
               



            . I am a watchman of Long-acre - Mr. Windsor's shop is on my beat; I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Beck
               



             taken to the watch-house - in my judgment Smith was not at all in liquor. I saw the prisoner about half-past one o'clock, and when Smith came back from the watch-house, he laid hold of her and said,
"This is the girl who robbed me with the other;" he said, he was quite positive, and would swear it a thousand times that she was with the other, that she had her hand in his pocket - she was taken to the watch-house.
Cross-examined. Q. There are many girls of the town in Long-acre - A. Yes; the prisoner denied the charge, and said he was mistaken.


                  WILLIAM 
                  GARDINER
               



            . I am a watchman - Mr. Windsor's shop is on my beat; as I was crying half-past twelve o'clock, the prosecutor and a woman were talking together close against Mr. Windsor's premises, but before Ihad gone my round I heard the alarm and I ran up; I went to assist with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Beck
               



             to the watch-house - another watchman came, and said they had found the watch.
Cross-examined. Where did he say the watch had been found - A. In Phoenix-alley, and they wished me to go back and seek for it; the prisoner was not then in custody - when I passed them together the prosecutor did not say anything to me; his language to them did not appear angry, or I should have ordered them away.

            . I keep a shell-fish shop at the corner of Phoenix-alley - I heard the cry of watch at half-past twelve o'clock, and in about a moment the prisoner came running from Long-acre - Phoenix-alley is a thoroughfare; she stooped and picked up something - I only saw her stoop.


                  SARAH 
                  GIBBS
               



            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 18th of August, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw a watch with a key hanging to it against a spout in Phoenix-alley, it was picked up by a woman - I told my husband of it, but did not go in pursuit. I saw the prisoner at Bow-street, but cannot swear that it was her.


                  MARK 
                  GIBBS
               



             re-examined. Q. Your wife told you of a woman picking up a watch - A. Yes; I saw the woman - it was the prisoner; she looked me full in the face as she got up.

            . Aged 24.

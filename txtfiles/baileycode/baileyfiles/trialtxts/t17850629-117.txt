I am a gentleman's servant out of place , I lived with one Mr. Prior, in Surry , at Carehauton ; I was going through Long-lane, on Wednesday night, when the company were coming from the Artillery-Ground; the prisoner was going along, and he dropped a pocket book from under his arm, I picked it up, and gave it to him again, and going down Barbican I saw him take this handkerchief out of his pocket.
Prosecutor. Deeves gave me a handkerchief, and I took it to the constable.

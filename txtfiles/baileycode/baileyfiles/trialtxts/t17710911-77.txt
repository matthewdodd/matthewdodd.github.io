            ; our house was robbed on 16th of August, about seven o'clock; we lost several things; among others five silver spoons. The prisoner was taken up on suspicion the 19th; he said he knew nothing of the matter. I went to him on the 20th, in New Prison, he pleaded ignorance; they brought an acquaintance of mine in; my acquaintance looked on the prisoner and said that is the person that robbed you. I left my friend and the prisoner together; in about three quarters of an hour, I said I believe we shall make something of this young man. I made no promise; he said he should insist on three things; first, to see a woman he had lived with, who had been in Covent Garden round house; second to have the three guineas again which sir

             had taken from him; and third to have his irons taken off. They went to sir John's, and gave an information of it; he was brought down and that night made a confession.

            . I have known the prisoner a great while; my house was robbed the 16th of August last of these things. I found them at Cunningham's, at the bottom of Fleet ditch; the prisoner went along with me, and shewed me the house where they were.

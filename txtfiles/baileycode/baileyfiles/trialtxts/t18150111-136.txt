. The prisoner was their labourer
. On the 11th of January the bell rang at one o'clock for the men to go to dinner, the prisoner remained in the yard. On his perceiving me, he went into the stable. I asked him what business he had there. He made a frivolous excuse, and went out of the gateway. I perceived he walked aukwardly; I went after him, and brought into the yard, and told him to go into the accompting house. On his going up the accompting house steps, I perceived him move aukwarkly; he had something concealed in his breeches that he was going to throw away. I laid hold of his arm, and prevented him. He had this main brace concealed in his breeches. I secured him; my employers sent for a constable; his lodgings was searched, and the other property found there.

            . I was present at the prisoner's lodgings being searched; the prisoner's wife was there; she said it was his lodging. We found four braces there, and two chariot springs; they are worth thirty shillings altogether, I produce them. The prisoner's wages was twenty-two shillings a-week.

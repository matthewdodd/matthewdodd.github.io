            . I am a servant at No. 8, Thornton-place. Mr. McDonnell lodged there. On Saturday last, the prisoner came with a letter, and told me to take it up to mistress. I went up, and when I was on the stairs I heard him come along the hall. I looked down and saw him take this coat off the pegs, he doubled it under hisarm and went out - I gave an alarm. Turner stopped him and I took the coat from him.

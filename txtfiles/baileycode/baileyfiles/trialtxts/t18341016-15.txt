                  , a letter, demanding money of him, with menaces, and without any reasonable or probable cause, which letter is as follows: - "Sir, - With my friends' wishes, I again write to you concerning the money which I have received of you, which is 2l. Sir, I should thank you to give me a final answer, and that is, whether you intend to give me the full amount of my loss, which is more than you may think for. The clothes which my uncle bought me for the sea, amount to 2l. 4s.; my wages 3l. 15s.; the full amount 5l. 19s. Now, Sir, it is determined by myself and my uncle, if the money is not paid some time this week, he will write for the captain to come to London; if such should be the case, it will cost you 20l., besides disgrace you for ever; but, Sir, my uncle do not now who it is, nor shall he now, if all things go wright to my mind; but i shall expect to have the full amount. Sir, the captain have wrote to my uncle concerning the villainy that some person or persons have been guilty of, as the case is something similur to that of Mr. Barnes and the soldiers. Sir, i can assure you, unless you pay me the full amount, something serious will occur, but i should be very sorry for such a thing, as it very possibly might ruin you for ever; but, Sir, perhaps you would rather pay a little than pay a great dell, but you can please yourself, and act as you please; but by God almighty, if the money is not paid me by three o'clock to-morrow afternoon, dread the consequences. 3l. 19s. is my demand. I remain, your humble servant, Henry Smith;"
             - against the Statute, &c.

2nd COUNT like the first, only calling the letter a certain writing.
MR. CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution.

            . I am a ship-chandler
, and live in East Smithfield. I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, before the 23rd of September - on the 1st of October, I was in the neighbourhood of the Minories, and saw him there, waiting at the corner, evidently watching my coming out of Mr. Richardson's, the grocer's shop - he came up to me, and put this letter into my hand - I read it in his presence, and said to him, "I thought you told me you were going into the country" - he said he had been advised not to go - I made an appointment to meet him again in Fenchurch-street that afternoon - this was about ten o'clock in the morning - I then proceeded to the Thames police-office, and saw Mr. Ballantyne, the magistrate, and in consequence of directions I obtained there, I went into the City, and Herdsfield was sent with me - I marked a sovereign - I met the prisoner in Fenchurch-street, at three o'clock - I went up to him and said, "You are here waiting" - he said, "Yes" - I said, "What a villain you must be, to give me this trouble" - he only laughed at me - I put the marked sovereign into his hand - Herdsfield then came up, and took him into custody - I gave him the sovereign under the decided impression of fear - it was arranged that he should be taken into custody by my giving him the marked sovereign - I had no apprehension when I parted with the sovereign, because he was to be taken into custody - I never supposed he would take any step for the purpose of extorting money - I gave him that sovereign for the purpose of having him taken into custody - I was under no apprehension.(The letter was here read, for which see the indictment.)
Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. When was the first time you saw the prisoner? A. The 23rd of September was the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that I ever saw him in my life - I swear that positively - I am a ship-chandler, and have a warehouse - I never gave permission to any person whatever to sleep in that warehouse.
Q. In the early part of this year, for instance, did you happen to meet with any sailors or others, in a destitute condition? A. Not to my knowledge - I meet with such persons every day - I was never applied to to allow persons to sleep there - I have been applied to for relief almost every day by persons of one sort or another - I never told any body that I had seen the prisoner before - I swear positively I never spoke to the prisoner before in my life, and never saw him, to my knowledge - I never gave him permission to sleep in my warehouse, never at any time in my life - I never gave him any money before the 23rd of September - I never gave him any bread and cheese, nor any victuals.
Q. Did you ever say to him, "If you come about half-past nine or ten o'clock, I will let you in; but do not let any of my people see you stand about the gateway, but walk up and down on the other side of the way, and when the shop is closed you can walk through?" A. Never - I do not know a person named Dixon, nor John Pettigrew, that I know of - not by name - I never gave money or victuals to the prisoner before September, nor any articles of clothing, to my knowledge - I will swear positively I never gave him a waistcoat, or any thing - I did not go into my warehouse between four and five o'clock one morning in July, and see any persons who had been sleeping there.
Q. Did you, on any morning in July, say to any person in your warehouse, "Put up the rug and things in the same state as you found them, otherwise my servants may suspect that somebody has been sleeping there?" A. Never - I have no such things in my warehouse - I never said so to the prisoner, nor any thing like that, overnight, to any body - I never, to my knowledge, saw the prisoner till he put the first letter into my hand - I never gave permission to the prisoner and another young man to sleep in the warehouse, nor on any boxes there - I never told him or any person, that before he left the warehouse in the morning, after he slept there, he must look out to see if the watchman was off his beat.
Q. I understand you to say, you never, on any occasion, attempted to take any liberty with this man? A. Decidedly not - he never said to me, "Come, Sir, this will not do for me" - I never said to him, "I hope you will not take any notice of what has occurred," and gave him 6d. - not give him biscuits and cheese, saying, "Take this; I hope you will never notice what has occurred."
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you authorize any body to go to the attorney for the prosecution to see the letters in this case? A. Never - the person now standing behind the Counsel came to see them - I told him they were in the hands of my solicitor - I never authorized him to go and see them - I have a shopman named 
               
                  William 
                  Walker
               



             - Manning is my porter - he does not keep the keys of the warehouse - it is his duty to lock it up at night, and open it in the morning - I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, till the 23d of September - there is not the slightest foundation for these abominable insinuations.
MR. JONES. Q. Did you not give the prisoner authority to go to your solicitor, to see the letters, and give him the name and number of the street? A. I told him the street he resided in - he said, "Oh, that is where Mr. Harmer formerly lived" - but I never gave him permission to go to see the letters.


                  THOMAS 
                  HERDSFIELD
               



            . I am a City officer. In consequence of information, I went, on the 1st of October, with the prosecutor, to Fenchurch-street - he had previously marked a sovereign - the prisoner was sitting on the step of a door, in the street - the prosecutor went up to him, and he rose up - I saw something put into the prisoner's hands, and I took him into his custody - I found a sovereign in his right hand, which I produce - I have had it ever since - he would not at first give the sovereign up, but I said he must.
Cross-examined. Q. Did any words pass between Mr. Collins and the prisoner? A. Not in my hearing - I saw something pass, but I cannot tell what it was.
JURY. Q. In what state of mind was Mr. Collins when he left you to give the sovereign? A. Much the same as he is now - he was not alarmed, that I could see.
MR. COLLINS. This is the same sovereign.


                  THOMAS 
                  MANNING
               



            . I am porter to Mr. Collins, and have the care of the warehouse from six o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night; and sometimes later, when we are busy - after locking up the warehouse, I goand hang the keys up in the shop - I never knew the prisoner to sleep in the warehouse - he could not have gone into the warehouse while I had charge of it - I have been in Mr. 
Collins' employ about two years.
Cross-examined. Q. You lock the warehouse at night, and hang the keys in the shop, where your master can have access to them? A. I always hang them in the shop - the shopman mostly has the keys - my master can get to them at any time - I shut the shutters, and the shopman locks the shop doors - I shut the warehouse up - the gates of the warehouse lead into the street.
Q. Is there a passage through the house or shop into the warehouse? A. There is a yard - if I had taken the keys home with me, and my master wanted to get to the warehouse, he could not have got to it from the shop, without breaking locks open, as the place was bolted and locked- the yard door was padlocked and bolted - the key was along with the other keys - if my master took the key of the padlock, he could get into the warehouse without going into the street.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does Walker, the shopman, sleep on the premises? A. Yes - the prisoner never slept in the warehouse, to my knowledge - Walker and I once let in a young baker, who was destitute, unknown to our master - we let him in twice, but unknown to master - nobody ever slept there, to my knowledge, except in those two instances - we let the baker out, on both occasions, in the morning, unknown to master - nobody else was ever let in to sleep, or be there any part of the night, to my knowledge.
MR. JONES. Q. You never told your master of it at all? A. Never, up to this moment - this is the first time I have mentioned it in his presence - he has never asked if any body slept there - I locked the young man in the loft, before I went home, and let him out in the morning, for he had no place to go to.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you any motive for letting him sleep there, except from motives of charity, knowing he was destitute? A. None whatever.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WALKER
               



            . I have been shopman to Mr. Collins eighteen or twenty months. The warehouse keys are placed in the shop after Manning has locked it up - I sleep on the premises every night, on the floor between the shop and warehouse - a passage leads by the head of my bed to the warehouse - a poor baker was allowed to sleep in the warehouse two nights, unknown to master - I know of nobody else ever sleeping on the premises during the time I have been there - I have slept there ever since I was in his service - nobody could have been brought to sleep in the warehouse without my knowledge - nobody, except the baker, ever slept in the warehouse or loft.
Cross-examined. Q. What time did you generally go to bed? A. From ten to half-past eleven - the porter locks the warehouse up, and hangs the keys up in the shop, and I lock the shop up - I am not in the habit of going out on business for my master in the day time - my duty is in the shop - I was never out during the day in July last - never for an instant - I take my meals up in the parlour - I never go out with bills, or to collect accounts - we give no trust - I have a holiday on Sunday - I am about the warehouse- it is impossible that a person could be introduced into the warehouse, in the course of the evening, without my knowledge - I look over the warehouse every night before it is locked up - it is impossible persons could sleep there - they must come through the side door, by the shop - the gates are not open in the day time, only when a truck is going out- we go through a small door to go out, through the passage, out of the shop.
Q. Must you necessarily and unavoidably go through the shop to get to the warehouse in the daytime? A. Yes - if the truck is going out, the porter puts it out at the gate, and returns through the shop - the gate is wide enough to admit a cart - several trucks stand there, belonging to different tradesmen in the parish - they can come for their trucks without my knowledge, but our place has no communication with that - the gate has nothing to do with it - the yard has cottages up it - upon going through the gate, I could not go into the warehouse without going through the shop - I get up at six o'clock in the morning - my master gets up about seven or eight - I never knew him to get up earlier than half-past six o'clock - I never found him up when I got up - it is impossible for any body to pass from the shop without my hearing them, at any time of night - the keys of the warehouse are locked up in the shop, and the key of the shop is in my pocket all night - I first saw the prisoner when he was at the Mansion-house - I never saw him about the warehouse, nor in the street - it is a street of extensive traffic - I am always in the shop, or from the shop to the door - we have a window looking into the street - I attend to my business in the shop - I never told my master about the young baker up to this moment- I never had any conversation with him about this prosecution - he told me to attend here, and at the Mansion-house - I went to be a witness, if I should be required - I have not had a word of conversation with him on the subject of the prosecution.
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me clothes before I went to sea - he has given me clothes several times to go to sea with, and several times he has given me victuals when he has seen me stopping about; and three nights he gave me leave to sleep in his loft with a young man who is at sea - when I took him the letters, before he looked at the first letter, he gave me 2s., and told me to meet him in the afternoon, and he would give me a sovereign - before he gave me a sovereign, he took me into a gin-shop, and called for a quartern of gin, which he gave me, and told me if I met him at three o'clock he would give me the sovereign - he gave me another on the Friday, and then he shook hands with me, and bid me good bye, and told me to go home and send a brace of partridges and a hare up to him for a present, and he would give me more money at another time, as trade was very bad with him, he did not take 5s. in a day - he shook hands with me, and bid me good bye; and said he hoped I should not trouble him any more yet - I went home: when I gave him the last letter, I told him I would take him before my uncle- he said, "Very well, meet me at three o'clock, at the same place" - I was waiting for him there - he came to me, and offered me a sovereign, which I refused at first, and he pressed me to take it - he said, "I will make it up 5l. to you; but I can give you only this sovereign at present" - instead of his going with me to my uncle, he went round to the Mansion-house, and brought an officer and took meinto custody - he pressed on me not to let the charge be known, and he would be a good friend to me.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. It was about the beginning of July that I first saw him - I have no acquaintance with his family - I do not believe he lived at any place in particular in July - he did not keep a stall - I believe he was destitute - I live in May-pole-court, opposite St. Katharine's gates - I am married - my wife gets her living in the same way that I do - she keeps no stall - she stops at the Marquis of Granby - I deal in every thing as it comes in season - the person standing behind the Counsel is the prisoner's uncle, as far as I know - I believe it was this day week that I first saw him - he called on me - I only knew the prisoner by seeing him sitting on the steps by the side of an empty house, where my stall is with the lumpers - I did not know where he lived - I never told him where I lived - I cannot tell whether he knew, nor how the uncle found his way to my house - I can write - I do not write letters - I was not at my stall to-day nor yesterday - I have been at work as a bricklayer's labourer for my landlord, Mr. Hurn, No. 1, May-pole-court, for the last three weeks - he is not here, that I know of - I believe I have spoken to Mr. Collins - I believe he had some oysters at my stall the very first day they came in, in August - I saw the prisoner's uncle when he called at my house - I believe the prisoner's brother called with him - they asked if my name was Dixon - I told him it was - I cannot tell how he knew my name - he asked if I kept a stall at the bottom of the court - I said I did at times when I had nothing else to do - I was brought up as a gentleman's servant, and for the last seven or eight years I have been in the army till I was discharged - I was in the navy some time - I have not been any thing else - if I can get a day's work I do, at any labouring work - I never beat a carpet in my life, except when I was a gentleman's servant - I cannot exactly mention the last day I was at the stall at St. Katharine's dock gates - I have been there within the last two months, selling oysters ever since they have been in - when the prisoner's uncle and brother called, they asked me if I remembered two young men at the dock gates (countrymen) being about there - I told him I did - he asked how long it was since I saw them - I said,"To the best of my knowledge about three months since I saw one of them" - he asked if it was Henry - I said I did not know their names, they were quite strangers, I only knew them by asking where they lived, and where, they came from, at different times - he asked if I ever knew him sleep at Mr. Collins's warehouse - I said I never did - he asked how long it was since I saw him last - I said, to the best of my knowledge, about three months; when the prisoner went away from the dock gate, he told me he had got a schooner, and was going away - the uncle asked if I knew where he went to when he left the dock gates - I told him he told me he had got a schooner which laid in the London docks - I do not recollect saying any thing else - the uncle asked if I had ever seen him speaking to Mr. Collins - I told him that I did - he did not say any thing to me about a letter - the gentleman who was with him spoke about a letter, but not to me - Mr. Garrett told me the day before yesterday what the charge was against him - he did not mention the letter to me the day he first called, to the best of my knowledge - the uncle mentioned about the letter to the young gentleman who was with him - when they questioned me, I heard the uncle say that the letter corresponded with what I said.
Q. That was his nodding, and asking him if he had any thing in view? A. Yes; they had no letter in their hands - I have got my living for the last three weeks by working for my landlord at 18s. a-week - when I went to Mr. Garrett, on the Saturday, he gave me 1s., to get a drop of beer, going home - I think it was last Saturday - he asked me if I had got any money, and I said "No" - it was his pleasure to give me 1s. - he never gave me any thing before or since - I have not received any money from him or any body - nor the promise of any - I am brought here to-night by Mr. Garrett - he sent for me from my home without any subpoena - I have not been examined by an attorney to see what I had to say - Mr. Garrett did not take down what I said - he gave me his direction where to call on him, and I called - I believe the other witness who is coming, is tollman to the London Dock Company - his name is Pettigrew - he has been always tollman there during the five years - I saw him first about this the day after Mr. Garrett called on me - he came up, and asked if a gentleman had been to me - I told him there had - Pettigrew did not go with me to Mr. Garrett's house, nor did we meet there - I have never been in Mr. Collins's warehouse myself - I do not know that I am to receive any payment for attending here - I do not expect any - there was no promise made to me about it - I have not said I expected to be paid for my loss of time - I have not been promised any thing for coming here - Mr. Garrett never promised me any thing - his words were last night, "I dare say you will be satisfied for your trouble" - that is all I ever heard from him or any body - I do not know who was to satisfy me - I said nothing to him about it - Pettigrew was not there then - he had not been at Mr. Garrett's that night - I had been with him that night - I see him almost every day - I saw him last night in Mr. Garrett's company - I was never in any trouble myself, nor ever charged with any offence - I was before a magistrate four years ago for breaking some of my own windows when I was intoxicated - that is the only time I was ever before the magistrate in my life - I have never been a witness before, nor ever in a court of justice before.
MR. JONES. Q. Is there the slightest pretence for saying you were ever paid for giving evidence in Court? A. No: I was seven years and nine months in the 50thregiment of foot; and was invalided, after coming from the East Indies, having constant fits - I left the navy in May, 1820 - I was there from 1809 till 1820 - I was servant to different gentlemen - Captain-General Foulks - I lived with him about three years, and with Captain Duncan about five months; and I was servant to Captain Dixon - I did not leave any of those gentlemen in consequence of any complaint of my conduct - I was paid off on the peace establishment, and have kept a stall in the street almost ever since; but at first I was a watchman of Marylebone for three or four months - I have kept the stall about four years - no accusation has been made against me on any occasion - the rent-gatherer took me before the magistrate for breaking the window - I paid the fine, and was discharged - I have no doubt of Collins's person.

                  JOHN 
                  PETTIGREW
               



            . I collect the East Smithfield tolls, and am employed by the London Dock Company - for the last four years I have been employed by the Dock Company - I have been fourteen years collector of the tolls - I first saw the prisoner about five months ago, in East Smithfield, nearly opposite St. Katharine's dock - I know Mr. Collins - his warehouse is about a dozen or fourteen houses from my standing - I never saw Mr. Collins and the prisoner talking together - I have seen Mr. Collins nod to the prisoner, and speak to him one word - he said, "How do you get on?" - that was all that passed - I have seen him do it ten or a dozen times between three and four months ago - it is more than three months - I have seen this in East Smithfield by my standing - I have seen nothing else pass between them- I am sure the prisoner and Mr. Collins are the same persons.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the expression? A."How do you get on?" - I never heard him say, "Have you any thing in view?"
Q. Did not he sometimes say, "Have you any thing in view?" Dixon says that is what he said? A. I might not have heard it when Dixon was there - I never heard it - I have known Dixon upwards of three years - I cannot say exactly - I have known him four, five, or seven years - I have not known him ten years - it may be between four and five years - I do not know any body belonging to the prisoner's family - I have seen him and another young fellow there when I was taking toll, four or five months ago - he never said any thing to me about a letter which he had written - I never heard of it until this time.
Q. Do you mean to say, to-night is the first time you heard of a letter being sent, written, or delivered by him? A. Yes; Mr. Garrett, his uncle, has been to me in East Smithfield - I saw him yesterday evening in Back-church-lane, at my residence - I first saw him about a fortnight ago - he came to me in East Smithfield, at the toll place - I did not know him before - I do not know how he found me out - he never said a word about a letter - he talked to me, and gave me a glass of ale at the Phoenix - he went there with me - we had a glass of ale together, nothing else - I did not see him again till yesterday evening, which was the second time I ever saw him in my life - he did not take down any thing I said to him - I do not know who is to pay me for coming here - I did not come for gain - God will, I hope, pay me for speaking the truth - I have never received any money from Garrett - I was in company with Dixon last night, about half an hour, at my house in Backchurch-lane - he came to the house at six o'clock - this gentleman was with him.
Q. If Dixon swore he never was in company with you and Garrett together, is that true? A. At the door, we were in company together, and talked together - Garrett told me to come here at five o'clock this evening - Garrett never mentioned the letter - I never heard what the prisoner was charged with, nor for whom I was to appear, nor what I was to say - the prosecutor sometimes nodded to the prisoner, and sometimes said, "How do you get on?" - if he was in a hurry, he would nod his head - if not, he would say, "How do you get on?"


                  JAMES 
                  GARRETT
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Comyn, the barrister, and have been so twenty-six years - I am now in my twenty-sixth year. The prisoner is a nephew of mine by marriage - I ascertained from the prisoner where Dixon lived - this was the day after he was committed; and in consequence of that, I went to his house - as far as Mr. Collins has stated, he is correct, but he did not state all - Dixon has stated perfectly correct the interview I had with him - I went down to Mr. Collins, as I had not decided about doing any thing - I went down merely to know the nature of the charge - Mr. Collins was not within - when I did see him, I asked if he had got the letters - he said he had not, that they were at his solicitor's, who was Mr. Wooller, in Hatton-garden, somewhere - I understood him to say, "No. 30," and the name of Tomlins was on the side of the door - I went from his house to Mr. Tomlins, and found it was No. 40 - I wished to know the nature of the charge, and what it was - he then said,"Very well, Sir, you are quite at liberty to see them" - I went to Mr. Wooller, but I have never seen them till I saw them in Court to-night - I never held out any promise of money to the witnesses to give evidence here - I told them, over and over again, it was not in my power to do any thing for the lad - that I had a very large family of my own, and had not 1s. to spare, nor had either of his relatives - they said, all they wished was to come and speak the truth - I gave Dixon 1s. when he came up to identify the prisoner at the prison.
COURT. Q. How could you know you and he were speaking of the same person if he did not know who he was? A. The prisoner gave me a particular description of the persons, for he did not know the names of any of them - he gave me a description of several persons whom I have not been able to find - they said they had seen two lads together, but could not tell who it was till they saw the prisoner - I never gave Pettigrew any thing except the glass of ale.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at that letter, whose writingis it? A. I do not think it is the prisoner's - I never saw his writing in my life till this occasion, till I saw this statement which he gave me - (looking at another letter) I cannot tell whose writing this is - I have no knowledge about the handwriting - I think it is the prisoner's - I can pretty well say it is by the small "i" - it does bear the character of his handwriting - I think it must be his - I do not know why I should have any doubt about it - it is not exactly like the writing I have seen of his - I should say the first letter is the same handwriting, but written with a different pen.
COURT. Q. Do you mean you never saw the prisoner's writing before to-day? A. I saw it in his statement which he sent me - I have spoken to him about his statement - I have been in Newgate with him several days - he said the statement was in his handwriting.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now look at the first letter, have you any doubt that is his handwriting? A. The character of it certainly is very similar to the statement I received from him - I believe it to be his handwriting - I think I need not have any doubt of it being his - they are written with different pens - I have known him since he was a boy - he has been voyages to sea, and has been about in different situations within the last twelve months - at the beginning of this year he was some time in a public-house - he left that, I think, in the spring, and then went into the country - he was there a little time, and the next I heard of him was about Midsummer - I do not know how he got his living then - I do not know what he was doing in July until about the 21st September; he returned to London from an eight weeks' voyage - I only know that from his statement - he did not tell me where he had been - I did not write to the captain of his vessel "to know about the villany practised" - he has other uncles - he made no communication to me on this subject - he knew where I lived.
Q. In July last did he complain to you that Collins or any body took him into their warehouse, and attempted to practice indecencies on him? A. No - I knew where he lived - I never supplied him with clothes to go away with - he has an uncle or two about Ipswich - he did not come to me after he returned from the eight weeks' voyage to complain of being ill-used by Mr. Collins - I first heard a suggestion on his part, on the subject of the prosecutor, from receiving a letter from him when he was in Newgate - I never heard of the charge until he was fully committed - he did not send to say he was going before a magistrate - I went to Mr. Tomlins' office, in Hatton-garden, on the Saturday as the prisoner had been committed on Thursday- I represented to Mr. Robinson that Mr. Collins gave me permission to see the letters - Mr. Robinson expressed the greatest readiness to show them, but said they were gone to your chambers, and he expected them back on the Thursday, and that if I would call I should see them - I did not tell Mr. Robinson I was his uncle, and very likely he thought I was a friend of Mr. Collins's - I called a second time at Mr. Tomlins' office - my nephew, the prisoner's brother, was with me then - when I went the second time I did not see Mr. Robinson - I saw a clerk, who said, "I am sorry, Sir, to find you come here with a falsehood, for Mr. Collins never authorized any body to see the letters."
MR. JONES. Q. Have you or not been on habits of intimacy with the prisoner? A. When he has been in town he has called on us occasionally and had a meal.

             re-examined. At the different times I saw the prisoner, he was in company with another lad - I have seen him return what Mr. Collins said by making a bow - that was all the notice he took - he did not say how he got on - Collins never stopped, but went on - there were various persons about the gate - it was not addressed to any other person - I am satisfied it was addressed to the prisoner, because he has told me with his own mouth that Mr. Collins was good to him - that was before any charge was made to the prisoner.
Q. In what way did he say he was good? A. By giving him victuals to eat at different times.
MR. COLLINS re-examined. It is occasionally my custom to give away broken victuals and biscuits, at different times, to poor people; when I am clearing my shop, I instruct my servant to give away what there is to poor people, and if I am at home I do it myself - I sometimes know persons I give things to, and sometimes I do not - sometimes five or six distressed sailors together apply for the damaged provisions - one person brings another - they do not require much introduction.
COURT to WALKER. Q. Have you a place called the loft? A. Yes - nobody slept there except the baker - the warehouse and loft are all one - I sleep in a room leading to the warehouse - the loft is an upper part of the warehouse - nobody can get to it without going through the warehouse.
Prisoner. The witness is not Collins's shopman; he is only backward and forward - there is him and another young man - there is a young man who has played the same tricks with a young man who was with me - Collins's man has served the same trick to a young man who is at sea.

            . I am clerk to Mr. Tomlins, who is attorney for this prosecution - I have known Mr. Collins from eighteen months to two years, and where he lives - we have had business from him during that time, and this young man was serving in his shop with an apron on when I went there, as if acting as shopman; and he has been up to our office at times with messages from Mr. Collins.

             - we are pawnbrokers

, and live in Whitecross-street


. On the 7th of September the two prisoners came together, to pawn a gown, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening - I saw Elizabeth leave the counter; she seemed to move about; she said to Francis once or twice,
"Go, Jem" - that excited my suspicion; she stood against a partition - I went to serve another person; she then stood against the place where this shift was pinned - I went up, and she was covering this boy with her clothes; he had the shift under his frock.

            . I was on duty - I got this shift from the boy.
Prisoners' Defence (written). I and my brother went with another girl to the shop to pledge some articles, and whilst I was in the shop the girl gave my brother a shift to hold; soon after Mr. Matthews sent for an officer, and gave us in charge.

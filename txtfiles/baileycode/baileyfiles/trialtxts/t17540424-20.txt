            . On the 26th of March I had hung my watch on a brass knob, as usually I did, and was gone out, and when I returned it was missing; I suspected the prisoner, and in the afternoon I took him up; he acknowledged he had taken it, and that it was at Mr. Portal's, a silversmith, near Hungerford-Market; I went there, and described it to the silversmith, and he delivered it to me; [produced in court and deposed to.]

            . The prisoner at the bar brought this watch to me to sell, and I bought it of him for twenty-seven shillings.

I was very much in liquor; I do not know that I had the watch. A soldier that is in the same regiment with me took it of me, and after that said, he had left it at a silversmith's shop about three or four doors below Hungerford-Market; he has since deserted.

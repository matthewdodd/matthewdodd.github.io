WILLIAM FULLER
 (police-constable T 149.) On the 27th of November, about half-past seven o'clock, I was on duty in Cadogan-place, watching there, and saw the male prisoner ring Mr. Smithson's bell—the door was opened, he went in, and in about a quarter of an hour I saw him come out with a clothes basket—I stopped him, and asked what he had got there—he said, what odds was that to me, it was his own property—I took him back to the door, and rang; the female prisoner opened the door—I asked her if she knew any thing of the basket or its contents—she said it was all his, that he belonged to the house—I kept them, and sent for Mr. Smithson—the basket contained the articles stated.





CHARLES SMITHSON
. This female was a servant of mine, acting as nurse to Mrs. Smithson—I never saw the man before—he did not belong to the house—the officer called to me and I saw the things in the basket—I identify

the brandy, the cork of which had the name of my spirit merchant on it, and the whiskey the same—I had missed things several times.
(The prisoner received a good character.)

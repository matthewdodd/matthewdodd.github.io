            . It is a mill for grinding corn. The prisoner was in our employ at this mill. On the 2d of September I was alarmed by the watchman's rattle, I looked out of the window, the watchman told me he thought there was somebody stealing the poultry, and while I was dressing myself, he came and asked me if I knew any person that lived in such a house, I desired the watchman to wait at the mill to see if any body came there. I live about twenty yards from the mill. I went to the watchman and told him to go his round as usual, and I placed myself here to keep the watch. After I had been watching some time, I saw the prisoner go into the mill. When he came out of the mill, he had nothing with him, he came as far as the little bridge, to see if any body was watching him. He immediately after went into the mill and took something under his arm; he came out of the mill about fifteen yards, upon which I seized him by the collar; he had got barrel heads and hair brooms. I asked him whether he was not satisfied with going once. He said, he had not been home. I interrogated him, and then he said, he had been home, he had taken flour.
Q. Are these things the property of Mr. Leader and Co. - A. The hair brooms and barrel heads were in our possession, they are worth one and sixpence, or two shillings.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

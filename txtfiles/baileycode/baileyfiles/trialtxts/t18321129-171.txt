            . I keep a lace and cloak shop
, in High Holborn


. On the 17th of November I lost a cloak, which had been pinned to some others in the lobby of my shop - I named it to the serjeant on duty, and in about half an hour he brought it back.

             (Police-serjeant F 10). I received information from the prosecutor; I went to the watch-house, and received intelligence that the prisoner was at Bow-street, with the cloak on her shoulders; I went there, and found her the same evening - I asked her where she bought the cloak; she said, "I did not buy it at all, I borrowed it of my mother."(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. My father has been dead two or three months - he bought it for my mother; she was going into the country, and made me a present of it.
MR. COLSON. I never sold it; it met with an accident in the collar and is joined - it was safe not more than a quarter of an hour before we missed it.

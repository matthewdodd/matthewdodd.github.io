JOHN STANLEY. I am a carpenter
. On the 11th of April I lost these tools from a shop in Northampton-row, Holloway


 - I locked up the shop, and a desk which was in it, about seven o'clock; I was called up next morning. about half-past five, by Taylor, and found the prisoner at the watch-house with them.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 11th I stopped the prisoner about two miles and a quarter from Northampton-row, with these tools in a basket; he said he was going to work at Saffron-hill, for one Colson - I said I knew him, and he had had no work for two years - I took him to the watch-house, and found Colson, who said he was not to work for him.

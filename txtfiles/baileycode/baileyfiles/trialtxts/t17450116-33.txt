            . I was told that somebody had taken these things off one of the beds. I understood that a boy had been lurking about the door some time. I went to him and told him I suspected he had taken such things; he said, he knew nothing of them. And upon searching an empty house just by, a pair of blankets were found. Then he owned he got into a leaden gutter, went into the room and took them out of the window.

            . The prisoner came to me with a pair of sheets, said he was going on board a ship, and desired to leave them. He laid them down and said he would be there again in half an hour. I thought when he left them they had been trowsers, or some things for the sea, as he was in a sea dress. Mrs. Bell came in and asked for such things; my wife made a laugh at it, and said, there were no such things there. I said, a boy they call Mutton, had left a bundle, I shewed them to Mrs. Bell, and she said they were hers.

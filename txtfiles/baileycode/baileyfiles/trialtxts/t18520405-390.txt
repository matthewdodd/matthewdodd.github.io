ELIZABETH GIBBS




again indicted for stealing (in Surrey) 1 pair of boots, value 2s.: the goods of 




Francis Joseph Turney, from the person of  




Alice, Harriet Turney.






ALICE HARRIET TURNEY
. I am seven years old—I have been to school—I live with my father in Waterloo-road—I was playing there one day, and the prisoner came and spoke to me—she said, "Will you hold three half-pence for me"—she then said she was going to take me to a lady with some oranges—I went with her to Guildford-street—she took me into a court there, and told me to sit down—I sat down on a step, and she took my boots off, and said she was going to clean them—she gave me two buns, and told me to wrap my feet up with my frock—she went away, and did not come back—I am sure she is the woman.





FRANCIS JOSEPH TURNEY
. I am a butcher of Brighton-place, Waterloo-road—this child is my daughter—she was playing in the Waterloo-road on 11th March—she had a pair of cloth boots on—in consequence of something

I heard, I went that afternoon to a court in Guildford-street, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I found my child in a house, where a lady had been kind enough to take her to the fire.





PHILIP GRESLEY
 (policeman, 481 N). I took the prisoner on 12th March—this little girl saw her in the cell at the police court—where there were I think twelve other persons—she picked the prisoner out immediately—she was not pointed out to her at all—not only this child pointed her out, but I think twenty more children, as having robbed them in the same way.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

.
DAVID ROBERTS. I am a Welsh drover
. On the 7th of December, about four o'clock, I was in Smithfield; I had been drinking all day, I met a man in the street, he said you are a Welshman. I am not able to say who that man was.
Q. Who was in Wilson's public-house with you - A. These two girls, and the man at the bar; we were all sitting together in the tap-room; I was very tipsey. I called for a pot of beer, I changed something to pay I do not know what.
COURT. Were you sober enough to recollect what passed at that public-house - A. I was not. I am sure I was there. I am certain I sat in company with the three prisoners, I drank some beer, it was paid for.
Q. Did you see your pocket book while you were in the public-house - A. Yes. I cannot tell whether I took it out myself, I was tipsey; I went to sleep, and when I awoke I found the pocket book empty on the table, and the prisoners had all left the house; I told the landlord I had lost every farthing.
Q. Did you see the pocket book, or know that you had the pocket book before you went to that public-house - A. I put the notes in my pocket book at Rumford. I put it in my pocket, and I had never taken it out of my pocket, until I found it on the table.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WILSON
               



            . I am eight years old. I am the son of 
               
                  John 
                  Wilson
               



            .
Q. Do you know these three people at the bar - A. Yes; I saw them in the tap room on the night Mr. Roberts was robbed, the three prisoners came into the tap-room a little after seven, Mr. Roberts came in to the house after seven, after the prisoners; they all three were round him directly; he sat down and said, what are you all doing round me; 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



             said, let us look at your pocket book; Mr. Roberts called for a pot of beer, they all set down to drink it. Mr. Roberts was called on to pay for it, he took his pocket book out of his waistcoat pocket, he opened his book and took out a one pound note, hesent 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



             with it to the bar to get change. I did not see the change brought back. Then Mr. Roberts sent an Irishman with another pound note; the Irishman went to the bar and got change, and brought it to the Welchman. Bailey returned, and said, I am not like the other man.
Q. Did she return with the change - A. No, she had been out half an hour, and returned before the Irishman brought the change to the Welchman. The Irishman gave the Welchman the change; he put it into his pocket-book; in about ten minutes afterwards it was all gone from him. He pulled out the pocketbook once more, and then Hannah Green snatched the change out and the notes, and all three ran away together.


                  JOHN 
                  WILSON
               



            . I keep the Earl of Moira on Saffron-hill


; it was called the Castle public-house.
Q. Of course that boy is your son - A. Yes.
Q. On the 7th of December do you remember the prosecutor coming to your house - A. I saw him in the tap-room from six to seven o'clock.
Q. Did you see your boy in the tap-room - A. I cannot tell where my boy was.
Q. Do you recollect any of the prisoners being there - A. 
               
                   
                  Thomas Moore
               

             and 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



             were there; they sat next to Roberts; there were a great many about them; Roberts called for a pot of beer; an Irishman brought me a pound note; I changed it; I followed to see the Irishman give the change to the Welchman; I am sure I saw the Welchman put the change into his pocket-book, and put it into his pocket; the tap-room was full of people. I am sure Moore and Bailey were in the room; I told him I understood he had a deal of property about him; that if he staid in that company he would soon lose it. I begged him to come out along with me; he told me he would not, he could take care of himself. Presently afterwards a pint of rum was called for. I changed one of the dollars; I observed nothing more of it until four or five minutes afterwards. I saw four or five of them run out; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Moore
               



             and 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



            , I saw them go by the bar; I said, I dare say they have robbed the Welchman. They did not return after that; I went into the tap-room, the Welchman met me, and told me that he was robbed.
Q. Did you see his pocket-book at that time - A. I did not; I advised him to go home and come to me in the morning; after he was gone from me Chapman came and told me the twenty pound note was safe; I afterwards saw the note.


                  JOHN 
                  CHAPMAN
               



            . I am an officer of the city, I keep a liquor-shop in Long Lane. On the 7th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the Prisoner Moore brought me a twenty pound Rumford bank-note, he asked me to give him change for it. I knew him; I asked him how he came by the note; he said he had it of 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



             who was in my tap-room. I went into the tap-room and asked 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



            ; she said she gave it to him; she told me that she had it of a country gentleman for sleeping with him. I told them I could not think of that, I must stop the note; I did not detain them; I had not an opportunity, my shop was full of people. When they found I stopped the note, they instantly left the house. I went in search of them as soon as I could get rid of my company. I did not find them; I ordered the officer to take 
               
                  Tom 
                  Moore
               



             on my charge, and take him to the Compter; he was taken in the morning by day-light; I saw him in the Compter on Saturday morning. I understood there had been a Welchman robbed. I went to Mr. Wilson's; he said he had been there the night before, and between the hours of nine and ten I took 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



             in Field Lane; I sent her to the Compter. I then went back to Mr. Wilson's, there I found the Welchman. I desired him to meet me at Guildhall at eleven o'clock; he did. I produce the twenty pound Rumford note, it was offered to me by the prisoner Moore.
Prosecutor. It is my note, there is some red ink inside and some figures outside. I took the note at the White Horse, Rumford market.
COURT. Can you recollect at all whether on that night you went with Sarah Bailey any where except at this public-house - A. I was never out with her.


                  GEORGE 
                  WOOD
               



            . I am an officer of Hatton-Garden. I searched Moore at the lock-up house at Hatton Garden Office; I felt outside; I felt something hard; he resisted me putting my hand in. I got hold of the fob and cut it out; in it I found two one pound notes, two dollars, four shillings and a sixpence.


                  JOHN 
                  HUTT
               



            . I took Sarah Green. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bailey
               



             told me she gave the note to Moore to change; asked her how she came by that twenty pound note which Chapman had got; she told me that the Welchman had given her it as a one pound note, to go out and get some bread and cheese and onions with it.
Bailey's Defence. I was in the tap-room when the Welchman came in; he asked me after a young woman of the name of Nelly. I told him she was gone on board a ship; he and I drank rum together. He gave me a one pound note; I thought it was. I gave it to Moore to look at it; he said it was a twenty pound note; I asked him to go and get it changed; he went to Mr. Chapman's to get it changed.
Moore's Defence. I know no further about the robbery than a child unborn. The girl gave me the note to get it changed; where she got it I do not know.
Green's Defence. I was not in the house; I never saw the prosecutor before I saw him at Hatton Garden office.

WILLIAM BURD
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Vere-street. On the 31st of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I was passing King's Cross—the prisoner followed me, came before me, and looked up in my face—he then got behind me—I felt, and my handkerchief was safe—I walked on and found him still following me—when we got near the New Church, he ran down a street—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I pursued him, and he threw my handkerchief down—I left that, and ran after him down two or three streets—I then took him and said, "You

young dog, you have taken my handkerchief"—he said, "Forgive me, it is the first time"—he said he had dropped the handkerchief in the other street—I came back and found a tradesman had taken it up, and was waiting at his door—I gave the prisoner and this handkerchief to the officer.

             sworn.
I lost two pair of stockings on Friday the 8th of June; between five and six in the evening, the prisoner with another man and woman came into my shop; the other man wanted a jacket, he tried several on, but he refused to buy any being too long in the sleeve; and the moment they were gone I looked in the window, and missed two pair of stockings; they went all out together; I went out and took the prisoner, about one hundred yards from my shop; I found one pair of stockings in his left hand pocket, and Mr. Carpenter came by and took out the other pair; both the pairs were found on the prisoner; the others got off; he said nothing.

             sworn.
I belong to the public office, Shadwell; I saw this gentleman have hold of a man; he said he had been robbed; I caught hold of the prisoner, and took these stockings out of his right-hand pocket.
(Deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went into the prosecutor's shop with another man and woman to buy a jacket, and as soon as I came down the steps, I found these two pair of stockings.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

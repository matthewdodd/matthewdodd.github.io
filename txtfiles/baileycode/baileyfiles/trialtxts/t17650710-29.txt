            . I live in St. Giles's



; I had five pair of pigeons in a room in my house, and nine of them were taken away; they were found again the next morning, which was the 6th of June.

            . I am a butcher
. I had lost a quantity of meat, and in searching, I got a ladder and went up to a window, and saw this man's pigeons in a basket. The prisoners lodge at one Mrs. Davis's, and the pigeons were in a one pair of stairs room backwards there. The prisoners were taken before Justice Welch, and there acknowledged they stole the pigeons from the prosecutor.
Q. Did you tax Mrs. Davis?
Parker. I never could find her; but the boys at the bar used to lie in the room where the pigeons were found: I made Fluty turn out his pockets, and there were pigeons feathers in them.

            . I shall be seventeen years of age the 11th of July next: the two prisoners and I were concerned in taking the pigeons: we got over some pales, and got to the pigeons: we sent Fluty home with them to Mrs. Davis's.
Laurence's Defence.
There were more boys lived in the same room, and a girl; they might take the pigeons, for what I know.
Fluty's Defence.
They gave the basket to me, and I took it up into the room, not knowing how they came by it.

(M.) They were a second time indicted, for 


               stealing 27 pounds weight of mutton, value 7 s. and 11 pounds weight of veal, value 2 s.

            . After my meat was taken away from a cool place where I had hung it to keep, in the night, on the 5th of last month, I found some of the fat of the mutton near the door where the prisoners lodged; and after the boys were in custody, I put Laurence's foot into the print of a foot in the mould in my garden, and it fitted exactly. He then said he would tell me where my meat was. He took me over the Ruins of St. Giles's, and went up into an old uninhabited house; there was my meat under the roof of the house: he gave an account that Fluty and Williams were concerned. I took them both up. When before Justice Welch, the Justice would not admit him an evidence, but admitted Williams, who is very young.

            . Fluty and I were out last bonfire-night: when we came home, Laurence told us he knew of some pigeons we might get: we went over a wall, and, by getting on a barrel, we got up and got them: Fluty brought them home; we seeing this man's meat hanging up under a penthouse in the next yard, I went and got it, and gave it to Laurence, and he gave it to Fluty we carried it to our lodgings; Mrs. Davis begg'd of us to carry it back again, Mr. Parker being a neighbour: then I carried the mutton, and

             the veal; and we went to an empty house and hid it.
Q. to Parker. Where do you live?
Parker. I live opposite St. Giles's Church.
Laurence's Defence.
I told him the next day where it was.
Fluty's Defence.
They gave me the meat, and desired me to carry it: I would not; then they went and carried it to up to that place.

Henry Seymour, in a vessel on the 
Thames: having been before convicted.






EDWARD WILSON
. I am a seaman on board the John and Mary. which was lying at Bankside on 22nd Jan. Between two and three o'clock this morning I was disturbed in bed—I thought it was the boy, and called out, "Halloo, Bill. what are you doing here this time of the morning?"—some one ran up-stairs—I jumped up, ran up on deck, and saw the prisoner there, running away—he had no shoes on—it was moonlight—I cried, "Stop thief!"—he got on to the quay—I saw him in custody two or three minutes afterwards—I went back, and found the trowsers on the cabin stairs, they are Henry Seymour's, the captain's, and had hung by my bedside—I saw them on the stairs as I ran up—a box under the bed had been shifted, and some drawers opened.





GEORGE BATSFORD
. I was on duty in Guildford-street, heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running, without shoes, 200 or 300 yards from Bankside—I stopped him—he said he had been fighting—I asked him what he had done with his shoes—he said they made him pull them off to fight—he had stockings on—I took him back, and Wilson identified him—I found these shoes on the quay facing the John and Mary—he said they were his.





EDWARD EVEREST
 (Thames police inspector). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted, Jan.. 1848, and confined one month)—he has been summarily convicted five or six times, for stealing things on the river.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

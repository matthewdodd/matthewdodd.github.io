            . I keep a shop
 in Holborn

            . I stopt the prisoner in Holborn, with a piece of check under his arm; he appeared to be very much in liquor. (The check produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

I picked it up in the street; if I had stole it I should not have gone by the prosecutor's door with it.

JOHN PIERREPOINT LAVIE
. I live in Maddox-street, Regent-street. I was in Birchin-lane on the 17th of February, and had a handkerchief in my pocket, which I had seen an hour before—in consequence of information I looked in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—this is it—(looking at it)—it has my marks on it.





WILLIAM CHILDS
. I am a constable of the ward of Tower. On the 17th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Lombard-street, and saw the prisoner and another walking behind the prosecutor—I got behind a cart and watched them—I saw the prisoner put

his band into the gentleman's right-hand pocket and take out a silk hand-kerchief—he came across the way and saw me, and ran down Nicholas-lane—I punned and caught him in Cannon-street—I saw the handkerchief taken from him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Lombard-street, and saw the handkerchief on the ground—I took it up, and was going across the road,—he saw me, and said, "Drop it"—I ran away with it—I am innocent.




GUILTY
.† Aged 23.—


Transported for Ten Years.

64. 




JANE HISCOT
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 neck-chain, value 2l.; and 1 fan, 1s.; the goods of 



Emily Meikham.


MR. BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






EUPHRASIA HOWRATH
. I live in Wilton-crescent. The prisoner lived servant with me, and left me last May—this neck-chain and fan belong to my niece, Emily Meikham—she is eight or nine years old—they were given to her by her mother, who is in the West Indies.

Prisoner. That chain never was in my box—the fan was given to me by the coachman.





ELLEN PRICE
. I found the duplicate of this chain in the prisoner's box—it was in pawn for 15s.—I took it out of pawn—I had ever been in Mrs. Howarth's service, and had no opportunity of taking it.

Prisoner. I have to beg for mercy; I have been accused shamefully wrong.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Russell, at the Bell Inn, Friday-street


, he is a carrier



. On the 6th or 7th of February, four men came up the Bell yard towards the evening, and asked if the Exeter waggon came there. I told them yes, they told me they had some goods to send to Exeter. I asked them if we should send for them; they said, no, they kept carts oftheir own. They went down the yard, and returned in about five minutes; they then said, as we kept carts we might send for them, and asked for a pen and ink. I gave them the pen and ink. They came to the desk, two of them came round the young lad that was writing; one got hold of me, and the other was looking over the goods in the warehouse. I did not like him holding me by the shoulder; I thrust myself out of his hands, and I saw the prisoner at the bar go out with a truss under his arm; I holloed out stop thief, he had got about a dozen yards from the door and then dropped the truss. I picked up the truss and carried it into the warehouse.
Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person - A. Yes, by the face of him, I am certain he is the man, I had never seen him before.
Q. How soon after did you see him - A. I suppose it was about ten minutes, he was brought back the same night.

            . I live at Mr. Muggeridge's, in Fleet-street, I used to live with Mr. Russell, in Friday-street. On the 5th or 6th of February, four men came up the yard, and asked whether the Exeter waggon went from there. I and Underhill were in the yard at the time. We made answer, yes, the Exeter went from there. They went away and returned in five minutes; they said, they had got some things to go. I asked if we should send the cart for them; they said, they kept carts, they would send them. They went down again, and immediately came up, and said, as we kept carts we should send for them, they came in the warehouse, and told Underhill to put it down where to send for them, I was kneeling by the desk at the time. When Underhill was taking the direction down two of them had got their hands tight on my head, because I should not turn my head round; and another had got hold of Underhill by the head. The other man was walking up and down the warehouse. The prisoner took up the truss, and ran out of the door. I saw the prisoner run past the window with the truss. I immediately ran out of the door, and sang out, stop thief; the prisoner ran down Watling-street, the man that is here stopped him.
Q. Did you see him stopped - A. No, I did not, he dropped the truss about ten yards from the door, he was brought back in about five or ten minutes; I am sure he is the man, I could tell him by the face, he came up two or three times.

            . I am a servant to Atkins, Price, and Co. in Friday-street. On the night these men were taken, when I came up to them they went towards Cheapside. When I got to the corner of Watling-street, in Friday-street, I turned my head and saw them go into the yard again. After they had been up the yard about a minute or two, I heard some person cry out stop thief. As I was going from the corner up to the gateway again they came out; this man was one; some went one way and some the other, this man went down Watling-street; I followed him, he turned into Bow-lane; as he got half way up Bow-lane, towards Cheapside, he was stopped. I never lost sight of him any farther than when he turned the corner of Bow-lane, and then I was not above the distance of ten yards from him. I am sure he is the same man.

            . I am a porter to Mr. Pickford, the Castle Inn, Wood-street, I was delivering some goods in Bow-lane, that night, and I had been attacked a little before that in Milk-street, by four men; they had pulled a truss out of my cart, I could not catch them, I was looking out sharp at that time, and this prisoner came running up Bow-lane, I heard a cry of stop thief; I jumped behind my cart, and catched hold of him by the collar. He asked me to let him go, I told him I could not, because I had been like to have been done before, I kept hold of him until I delivered him into the hands of the constable, Mr. Willis.

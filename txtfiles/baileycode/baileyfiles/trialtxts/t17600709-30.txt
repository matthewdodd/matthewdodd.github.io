Hen. Heathcote. I keep an inn; the prisoner had lived with me 3 different times. The 2d of June the prosecutrix, that has lived in my family a long while, missed 16 guineas; upon enquiring who had taken it the same day, the prisoner went out, and did not return till we found her in Old street.

            . The prisoner went away at half an hour past 4 in the afternoon, and we found her in Old street the next morning. She was taken before a magistrate; there she own'd she had taken my 16 guineas, which I had miss'd; we found upon her 11 guineas, and 3 s. which she acknowledged to be my property, I had that again.

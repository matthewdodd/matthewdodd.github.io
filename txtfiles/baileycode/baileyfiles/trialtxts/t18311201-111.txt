            . I am a painter
. On the evening of the 19th of November I went to a pawnbroker's - I took a coat out of pawn, and laid it on a chair; I then looked at some diamonds, and when I turned the coat was gone - I went, by direction of the pawnbroker, to Mr. Merret's, another pawnbroker, where I found the prisoner pawning it; I had seen him in the shop where I lost it - this is it.

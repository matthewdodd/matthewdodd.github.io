                     Sarah 
                     Prince 
                  



                
             and 
               
                  
                     Margaret 
                     Greenwood 
                  



                
             for 


               feloniously receiving the same, knowing them to be stole
            . It appear'd that Yeomans was a Chairwoman
 to Lewis. Who missing the Goods, charge'd her with stealing'em. Yeomans then sent word to Prince, at whose
House she lodg'd, to remove her Goods. Prince call'd Greenwood to assist her; and the Prosecutor going to Prince's House, met Prince and Greenwood on the Stairs with the Goods upon them. Prince and Greenwood in their Defence, said, they thought somebody was coming to seize Yeoman's Goods for Debt, and were going to secure'em. They called several to their Reputation. The Jury found Yeomans was 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.
             and 

               acquitted
             the other two.

, a public-house, on the 19th of August, between nine and ten, the prisoner came and asked for lodging; I left him one; he went to bed, he came down in the morning about eight, and asked for a dram at the bar; I served him, he went away directly; I went up into his bed-room, there was never a sheet; I pursued and overtook him at the Unicorn, and in his bundle I found my sheets; I brought him back, and charged a constable with him, and he was committed.

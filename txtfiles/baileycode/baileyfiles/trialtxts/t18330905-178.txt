            . I am servant to Caroline Stanley, she lives at Paddington


. On the 16th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down the kitchen stairs, and saw the prisoner go up the area steps, with the spoon in his hand, at his side - I ran after him and called, "Stop thief," he ran as far as he could to the Park-wall, and I saw him get over - he was caught in the Park, and was brought back with the spoon, which had been taken off the dinner-tray on the kitchen table - I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me come down the area? A. No.

             (police-constable D 132). I was on duty, and a cab-man called to me, "There goes a thief;" I saw the prisoner running across the Park - I knew him, and followed him, crying, "Stop thief," a gentleman got out of a cab and stopped him, and I 
               drew
             this spoon from under his waistcoat.

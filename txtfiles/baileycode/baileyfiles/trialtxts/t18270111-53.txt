                  SEBASTIAN 
                  GAHAGAN
               



            . I am a green-grocer, and live in George-street, Bryanston-square. On the 9th of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, Salcomb, come out of Mr. Sansom's house, in Bryanston-square


, and down the steps with a pair of boots in his hand - Hitchman was in company with him - he had an apron full of things - Mr. Sansom is a customer of mine - I took no particular notice at that time; but delivered some parcels in George-street, then returned - and as I was taking some things to No. 30, Bryanston-square, I still saw them loitering about Mr. Sansom's door, which was ajar - this was a quarter of an hour after I first saw them - I watched them as I went up the square, knowing the family were out of town - they saw me; and when I went down the area of No. 30, Salcomb went up Mr. Sansom's steps - I told the cook, at No. 30 - I then ran back to the house; the door was then shut - I rang the bell, and told the woman, who was in care of the house; but could not then see the prisoners; I saw no more of them till last Sunday week, when I found them in custody.
Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. This is a public place? A. Yes; I saw nobody standing about but them - seeing them confused made me suspect them - the boots were in Salcomb's hands; they were high long boots, without tops - Hitchman had an apron full of things; I swear positively to both the prisoners - Mr. Sansom sent for me when he came to town - I described them to the officer, who apprehended them.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  DAVIS
               



            . I was in care of Mr. Sansom's house. On the 9th of November, about noon, Gahagan gave me information - I looked about and missed two pairs of boots, and a parcel off the bed, containing a shirt and waistcoat; one pair of boots belonged to Mr. 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Magniac
               



             - the pistols were not missed till Mr. Sansom came to town, which was in about a fortnight; and a dressing-case was missing: I had cleaned the door in the morning and shut it, as I suppose; but I am not sure of it- Mr. Magniac is Mr. Sansom's brother-in-law.


                  FREDERICK 
                  HOSTLER
               



            . I am butler to Mr. 
               
                  Henry 
                  Sansom
               



            : Mr. 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Magniac
               



             is his brother-in-law. I had left town on the 19th of October; Mr. Magniac had left a pair of hessian-boots in Mr. 
               
                  Philip 
                  Sansom
               



            's dressing-room - Mr. Sansom left some pistols in the dressing-room; but I do not know their value, as I never saw the case opened - I came to town on the 11th of November, and heard what had happened - I found Salcomb in custody about a fortnight ago; he was a stranger, and had no business in the house - the property has not been found.


                  PHILIP 
                  WEBSTER
               



            . I am an officer. I went with Gahagan, on the 7th of January, to a coffee-shop in Circus-street, and saw Salcomb there - Gahagan pointed him out- I told him I apprehended him for stealing (in November last) some boots, a pair of pistols, worth sixty guineas, and other property, worth nearly 100l.; he denied it; none of the property has been found - Hitchman had been taken before on another charge.
SALCOMB's Defence. I know nothing of it.
HITCHMAN's Defence. It is useless taking up your time, as the witness identifies me, which he can easily do, when the officer has described my dress to him - I had looked him in the face in the yard for a quarter of an hour before, and he said I was not there.
SALCOMB - GUILTY. Aged 21.
HITCHMAN - GUILTY. Aged 23.

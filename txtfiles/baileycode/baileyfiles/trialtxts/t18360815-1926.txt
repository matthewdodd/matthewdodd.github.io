ALEXANDER FRANCIS BAILLIE NICHOLSON
. I keep the Cock and Crown, in Little Britain. About five minutes before nine o'clock on the evening of the 26th of July, I was in Holborn, and felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned, missed my handkerchief, and saw the prisoner with it in his hand—he was in company with two more—I laid hold of him—one of the others took my handkerchief—I am sure it was mine—I held him a few minutes, and the officer came.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not come and accuse me of picking your pocket? A. Yes; and asked you to walk up Holborn with me—I said I saw you pass it to another—you were the first person near me when I lost it—it was not dark—it was just about dusk at the time.





BENJAMIN CATMULL
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner—it was not dark.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

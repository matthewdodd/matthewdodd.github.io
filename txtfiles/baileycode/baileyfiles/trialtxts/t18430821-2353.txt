JOHN THURLOW
. I am butler to the Rev. Dr. John Hume Spry. He lives in York-terrace—on the 6th of July we had four spoons and two forks in the dining-room—I missed them—these are them—they are my master's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The prisoner was not in your service? A. No.





ROBERT WATERS
. I live in Cirencester-place, Marylebone. I was near Dr. Spry's house on the 6th of July, and heard a cry of "stop thief"—I ran and caught the prisoner getting over some rails—I took him round to the house and sent for the policeman, who found these articles on him.





THOMAS WATKINS
 (police-constable K 310.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

RICHARD BAXTER
. I am a porter. About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 31st of January, I was at the end of Richmond-street, West-minster—I saw the prisoner and another standing close to the shop of Mr. Clinch—I watched them—the prisoner put his hand through a broken pane of glass, and took a goblet—I went and took him; he smashed the glass on the pavement, and broke it all to pieces—I took him to the station, and just as we got there the policeman met us, and took him in—he was searched, and another goblet found on him; he had a knife which he held in bis hand, and made use of a very bad expression, and threatened me.





WILLIAM BRIGGS

LOUISA CLINCH
. I am the daughter of John Clinch, who keeps this shop. On the evening in question I beard a noise, my attention was di rected to the board, and I missed these two glasses, which I had seen there about five o'clock, and this was after seven o'clock—this is my father's.

Prisoner. I was passing, and two boys were there, one of them put his hand through the pane of glass, and took this—the boy said, "Hold this while I tie my shoe"—the man came and took me up.

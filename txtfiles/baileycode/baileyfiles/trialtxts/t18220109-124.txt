            . I live with Mr. Govey, Mile End-road


. I had twenty-seven rabbits. On the 8th of January, I fastened them in the stable, between seven and eight o'clock. I was called up between twelve and one o'clock by the watchman, and found the staple of the door forced out, and nine rabbits gone. We went into the public-house, (the next premises) and found them there - five were covered over with straw - the prisoner was concealed at the corner of the yard. We found another dead, and three running about alive - the five were about a yard from him. He pretended to be asleep - he said there was three men just gone up the lane - he lodged at the Bell and Mackerel, next door.

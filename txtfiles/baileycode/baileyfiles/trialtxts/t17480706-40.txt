                  Skelston 
               



            . Eames, Higby, and Myers, broke into my house last Tuesday was sev'nnight.
Q. How came you to know this?
Skelston. Higby and Myers confessed it.
Q. What did you say to induce them to confess it?
Skelston. They confessed it freely, and they said they had pawned them, and sold them; they confessed it before Justice Ricards.
Q. What time did you go to bed that night?
Skelston. Between eleven and twelve, and was called up between two and three; and when I got up, I missed these things.
Q. How did they get in?
Skelston. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Myers 
               



             said she got in at the window, and delivered the things to Higby.
Q. What sort of a window is it?
Skelston. It is a pretty large sash window on the ground-floor.
Q. Where do you live?
Skelston. In Goodman's-Yard, in the Minories


.
Q. Did you leave every thing fast-at night?
Skelston. Yes.
Q. Is there any fastening to this sash-window?
Skelston. No; there was one Mrs. Robinson and a young woman in bed, and they took Mrs. Robinson's cloaths away, and the bedclothes off the bed, but they never heard them, or knew any thing of the matter.
Q. Have you got any of your things again?
Skelston. I got my stays, and some other things, by their direction.

                  Robinson 
               



            . I was at Mrs. Skelston's house last Tuesday was sev'nnight, and she asked me to lie there, and as it was late, I lay there.
Q. Is this room next the street?
Robinson. No, it is next the alley.
Q. Was there any thing happened to you in the night, between two and three o'clock?
Robinson. I awaked, and was a cold; the clothes were taken off the bed, and the window was open; the clothes were off the bed, but they were not taken away.
Q. Do not people kick the clothes off the bed in hot weather?
Robinson. They may, but these were put at the other end of the room.
Q. Did you see or hear any body in the room?
Robinson. I did not see or hear any body; but I found that my clothes were gone, a gown, a pair of stays, and a bever hat; and I missed the brasses off the chimney-piece.
Q. Were these things in the room when you went to bed?
Robinson. I pulled my clothes off when I went to bed.
Q. Have you found your clothes again?
Robinson. This boy, who is in Court, said, if I would give him half a guinea he would tell me where the things were, but he would not tell me without half a guinea. I told him I would give half a guinea to any body, and he told me they were sold by two of the Prisoners [Higby and Myers] to one

Q. At whose house?
Mills. At Carrol's; Higby lay there that night.
Q. What things did you see there?

Myers. I sold them to her, and she knew them to be stole.

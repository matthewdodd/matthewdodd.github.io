                  , from his person
            .
TOPHAM BINGLEY DAVIES. I am a surgeon
. I was in Tichfield-street


 at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock on the 8th of July - I had a handkerchief in my coat pocket; I felt it taken, turned round, and it was on the ground - the prisoner was immediately behind me, and a person with him; I collared the prisoner, but he struggled, and got away, and at the spot where he had stood I found my handkerchief; I am quite certain I felt one of them make a pull at my pocket - my wife was with me; the watchman came up, and I gave him my card.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were near you? A. The prisoner and the person with him were the nearest to me; there was a multitude of people before me - I did not see the prisoner speak to the other, but when I seized the prisoner he got away; I did not say at the office that I did not think he was the person who took my handkerchief.

            . I was in Tichbourne-street, and saw the prisoner in company with another person; I had some suspicion, and watched them; I saw the other encouraging this one to take the handkerchief, and the prisoner took it, as I presume, from the prosecutor; the prisoner ran, and I took him.
Cross-examined. Q.Was the other a grown up man? A. Yes. 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 21.

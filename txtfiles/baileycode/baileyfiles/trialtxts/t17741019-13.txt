            . I keep a chandler's shop
; the prisoner lodged in my house; somebody came to change a guinea on the 7th of July; I took out a little japanned box from the till in which I keep my gold; it had three guineas and a half in it; I took out half a guinea, and gave that and half a guinea's worth of silver in change; I put the guinea in that box; the prisoner was leaning against the compter at the time; soon after that I missed the money, and the shop woman and the prisoner were gone out; I suspected the prisoner, as I knew she was out of place, and had no money; she did not return till it was very late, and then was very much in liquor; I went up to her room next morning, and desired her to tell me what she had done with my money if she had it; she said she knew nothing of it; I said I would get a warrant and have her examined; I said I would give her till the afternoon to consider of it; she still denied it, and said she had no money to help herself; I got a warrant, and carried her before Sir

            , who had heard of my losing this money, gave me some information, on which I took her up a second time; she then owned she took the box with the money from the compter, but said there was no more in it than three guineas and a half; that she had laid it out in some wearing apparel which she had left in the care of

            . On the Tuesday before the prosecutor lost his money, the prisoner bespoke a pair of shoes of me, and said she would call on Friday about half after ten at night; she shewed me a guinea, which was in a black japan box, and besides a pair of silver buckles, and some ear-rings; she fetched a pot of beer and desired me to keep the box till next morning; the next morning she called and took the box, the buckles and a guinea, and desired one of my children to go to a pawnbroker's with her, for she wanted a pair of stays; she bought them, and some other things; she came back again, and desired to leave them till six o'clock, which she did; in the mean time I heard of the prosecutor's being robbed, and that he suspected it was by the prisoner; I went to Mr. Foreman, and told him what I had seen; he came with an officer, and I delivered up the things left with me.
- Clarke. I am a constable: when I took her the second time, I asked her why she would not own it at first, and what she had done with the rest of the money; she said she laid out about two guineas and a half; that she had drank rather too much, and that a man met her in the street, and she did not know what she did with the rest of the money, but there was but three guineas and a half in the box at the time she took it; that when she took it she did not know what was in it; that she held it in her hand some time before she thought of taking it; I asked what she did with the box; she said she threw it away in the street.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take this money; a gentleman desired me to accompany him all night, and gave me two guineas; next morning he gave me half a guinea, and bid me get some new clothes, and he would see me next day, and would take me into the country and provide for me to live with him.

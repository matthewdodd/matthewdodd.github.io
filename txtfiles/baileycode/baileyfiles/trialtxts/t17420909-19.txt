            . This Woman came to my Shop, and asked me if I would buy a Set of Curtains out of Pawn; I told her I would if I approved of them; I went to Mr. Grubb's, he called the Woman by her Name, and I found them there, the Gentleman wanted me to prosecute the Woman, but I was only to be an Evidence.
Court. It is your Duty, and the Duty of every one to prosecute. I believe you are an honest Man, but take care for the future.
The Goods must be delivered without being paid for: You have bought a thing the Seller had no right to. 


               Guilty 10 d.

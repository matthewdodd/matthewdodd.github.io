, Nov. 6

Cha. Cottrill. I had a pair of shoes in my right-hand pocket, the property of my master Mr. 
               
                  Nicholas 
                  Kuyte 
               



            . Coming by the Mansion-house


 in a mob, I put my hand upon my pocket, and found the shoes were gone. I turned about, and saw the prisoner about four or five yards from me; he was busy in putting his hands under his coat. I took him by the collar, and the shoes dropt from him. I put him into the Compter for that night; and the next morning, before my lord mayor, he said he did not take them out of my pocket. I did not feel him take them; but they must be taken out.

Prisoner's Defence.
I was leaning over a post; he came up, and said I had taken a pair of shoes. I said I never saw any; I was searched, but nothing found upon me.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately from his person
            .

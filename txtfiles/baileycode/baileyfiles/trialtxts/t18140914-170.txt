            . I sell pickled salmon and oysters
. On the 12th of September, a few minutes before ten at night, I heard something moving at the door; the salmon stood at the door, upon two boards. When I heard something move, I turned my head, and missed the tub of salmon; I ran into the street; I saw the prisoner with the kit of salmon, and the kit-cover in his hands. The kit and the cover is here.
Q. Where is the salmon - A. What was picked up, was stolen, by two men. The two men that were with him, told me if I appeared against him, they would kill me; I might expect nothing else.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent.

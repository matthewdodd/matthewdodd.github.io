WILLIAM HORTWRIGHT
. I live at St. Leonard's, near Eccleshall, in Essex. On the morning of the 31st of March, I was walking up Ludgate-hill

and in consequence of my attention being drawn, I missed my handkerchief—the prisoner was near me—I seized hold of him, and found my handkerchief under his great coat it had been safe in my coat pocket very shortly before—this now produced is it.





JOSEPH POLLARD
 (City police-constable, No. 502.) The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge, with the handkerchief.

Prisoner. I was walking up Ludgate-hill, and picked it up—a man came out of a shop and swore that I took it out of the prosecutor's pocket.





SAMUEL CHANDLBR
. I am shopman to Mr. Terersham, of Ludgate-hill—I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket.





WILLIAM GLADMAN
 (police-constable S 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I was present at the trial—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then convicted—I was also present when he was convicted previous to that—I had him in custody.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

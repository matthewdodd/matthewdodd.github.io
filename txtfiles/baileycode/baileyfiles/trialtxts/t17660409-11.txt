            . I am in partnership

            ; we are loaders

 at Queenhithe


; we take in and deliver out goods; we watch every other night. I was watching on the 5th of April; I saw the prisoner come over into the wharf, between 8 and 9 o'clock; he cut open the mouth of a sack, and took out some flour: when he got about half way out, I went and took hold of him. He had 26 pounds weight of flour in a bag; it was the property of Mr. Boys in the country, but we are answerable if any is lost.
Prisoner's defence.
I wish I had it now to make a dumplin of; I got it for that use; I had had no victuals for two or three days.

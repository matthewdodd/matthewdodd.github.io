GEORGE AUGUSTUS CLYMER
. I am a carpenter. I was at work in a new house in the Old Kent-road, on the 13th of August—I left the tools stated the lower floor of the house, about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon—I fastened up the place with a padlock—the lower part was boarded up—I went at six o'clock in the morning, and found a person had climbed to the first floor window, and taken them—these are ray tools—(looking at them)—they are stamped with my name—here is the stamp.





WILLIAM ROWLAND
. I am a policeman. I met the prisoner on the morning of the 14th of August, at half-past nine o'clock, in Artillery-passage, Spitalfields, about four miles from the house—he had these tools in a bag—I asked where he was going—he said his father was a carpenter, and he was going to take them to him at Holy well Mount; but he was going the contrary way—I took him to the station-house, and then he said they belonged to his grandfather, who was dead, and his grandmother had given them to him.

Prisoner's Defence. I told him I had come from my grandmother's, and then he said that I made two or three tales—I told him I was going to Holywell Mount, to my uncle's—I was coming from the New-cross Gate, and saw the bag in a ditch—I brought them to London.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

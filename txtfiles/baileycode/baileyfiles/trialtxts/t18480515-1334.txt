ANTONIO PINTO SUARES
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 watch, 6 shirts, and other articles, value 4l.; 8 half-crowns, and 10s.; the property of 



William Parrady, in his dwelling-house.






RIETA PARRADY.
 I am the wife of William Parrady, of Brown Bear-alley, Aldgate. On 21st Jan. the prisoner went home with me, and slept at my place—next morning I missed from a box a watch, an accordion, six shirts, six silk and three cotton handkerchiefs, a shawl, three waistcoats, and 1l. 6s. in money, and 4s. from my pocket—they had all been safe the night before—the prisoner left at about half-past six in the morning, while I was asleep.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. No—there was no one but him in the room.





ELIZABETH MILLER.
 On 20th or 21st Jan. the prisoner came home with Mrs. Parrady—I saw him in her bed-room—I locked the door outside, and put the key underneath—next morning Mrs. Parrady told me she was robbed—I had seen the things safe about four or five o'clock in the afternoon—no one could get into the room.

Cross-examined. Q. what time did she make the complaint? A. About seven o'clock—I do not know whether he had then gone out; it he had he must

have opened the door, and must have left it unlocked—the street-door opens with a latch inside—she missed her things directly he was gone.





ROBERT GIFFORD
 (policeman, H 89.) I apprehended the prisoner on 7th April, at the Brixton House of Correction—I told him I wanted him, for robbing, at lady—he said, "No, no, no"—that was all I could get from him—I found 13s. on him.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported For Seven Years, with a recommendation that he be imprisoned one year, on condition of his then leaving the country.

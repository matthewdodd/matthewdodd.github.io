            . The prisoner was my apprentice
; he had run away and robbed me several times. On the 3d of July, I fastened the house myself, and suspecting him, I marked several streaks in the morning; I missed several between five and six in the morning; the constable came and informed me, he had detected the prisoner in St. John's street, with an iron streak and the expin: he was taken to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's and committed.

The iron streak and expin were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.

            . I am a watchman: on the 4th of July, between two and three in the morning, the prisoner came by the watch box where I was; a watchman who was with me, said, he had something he should not have: I went after him and brought him back, and found the iron streak and expin upon him.

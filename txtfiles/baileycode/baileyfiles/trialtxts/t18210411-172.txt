            . I am a corn-chandler
, and live in Camden-place, Camden town


. I employed the prisoner occasionally to go out with the horse and cart, he was employed by the day as carman
. I believe this was paid on the 4th day of his services. I paid him 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. a day, according to his time. I employed him to deliver my goods and authorised him to receive money for me. On the 16th January
, I sent him to Mr. Stanford, of Finchley, with corn, and gave him a receipt for 8 l. 13 s. 6 d., which he was to receive; he came home about three o'clock in the afternoon with the horse and cart. I was obliged to go to bed ill, and saw no more of him till about the beginning of this month, when I saw him at Guildhall, he never came near me, nor ever accounted to me for this money. When he was apprehended he offered to satisfy me. I had not discharged him.

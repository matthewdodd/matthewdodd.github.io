            . I am one of the surveyors of Heston parish. I saw this plank safe on Saturday, the 24th of April; I' missed it afterwards, and having some suspicion, I got a warrant, and searched the premises where the prisoner lodged - I found this plank in a shed adjoining the house, cut in two pieces, and sawed again in the middle; it had been twenty feet long when we had it - the prisoner was taken on Monday, the 26th; he said he had found it, but did not say where - I had seen it in the gravel-pit on the 24th- there is no way through there: it cost me 1l. 0s. 8d., but it is not worth much now, as it has been used.

            . I am a labourer, and am employed by Mr. Hill. I left this plank safe on Saturday, the 24th of April, at six o'clock, in the gravel-pits: I returned to work on the Monday, and it was gone - I told my master of it; I know this is his plank.

            . I am constable of Heston. I had the search-warrant, and found this plank in the shed; and these irons, which were burnt out of it, were in a cupboard in the prisoner's house - I have matched them; they fit exactly - his house is about a mile from the gravel-pit.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I got up that Sunday morning, and went to a house where my mate lived, to help him dig up a piece of ground - I picked up this plank, and thinking it no more than fire-wood I threw it into my shed; if any one had come to own it, there it was; Mr. Hill found it neither locked up nor concealed - it is a public shed, which forty persons pass in a day.
MR. HILL. It was in a shed, and the pieces were set one against the other, and an old board wider than this set before them - there is no road only to where he lodged.

            . I am one of the Surveyors of Isleworth. I recollect part of a gate being safe on the 24th of April, between Isleworth and Heston; it parted the two parishes- it belonged to me as a surveyor of the parish: I saw it safe that Saturday, and missed it on the Monday, when I was informed it was stolen - it was in some enclosures, two or three hundred yards from the highway.

            . I am a game-keeper. On Sunday morning, the 25th of April, I saw the two prisoners, but I was not sure of their persons, till I gave them the meeting again; I am now quite sure they are the persons - I saw them come across the Review-ground, and saw Goodhall bury this gate under the gravel; Steers got on a high hill, to watch if any body came - this was about four o'clock in the morning; Steers then went down, and they went into the high road - they went to a pond to wash themselves; I went round and met them, to see who they were.

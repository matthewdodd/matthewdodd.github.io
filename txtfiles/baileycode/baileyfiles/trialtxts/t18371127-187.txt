RICHARD PALMER
 was indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






JOHANNA HANNAN
. I know the prisoner—he came to my house in Beaumont-row, Stepney on the 7th of November—I said, "There you are, Dick"—"Yes," says he—I said, "Where is my son? how is he?"—he said, Very well, but he is not at work to-day; for last night being bonfire night, he got into a scrummage, and struck one of the officers, and hat got locked up, and there is 2l. to pay "—he said he had been running about all day and had got 1l. 8s., and he wanted 12s. more to make up 21 to pay down, or he could not get out—I gave him a half-sovereign and half-a-crown—he came next day, and said, "I am come to tell you all is well, your son is out and gone to work "—I gave him a dinner and tea; and when he was going out, he said, "Your son will be obliged to you to let him have as much as will make up a sovereign"—I said, "How can he be so unthinking, he knows I borrowed the other"—I went and got him half-a-crown more; and I offered him the contents of the cupboard, but he would not take that—it was from his pretending that he came from my son for this money that I gave him the half-sovereign and half-crown.





JOHN HANNAN
. I am the son of Johanna Hannan. I was not locked up for striking an officer—I did not send the prisoner to my mother for this money—I had not seen him for six months.

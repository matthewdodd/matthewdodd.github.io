 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of June, 19 printed books, value 2l. 8s., the goods of

JOHN SOPER
. I live in Greville-street, Hatton-garden, and am a book-binder. The prisoner was in my service—I have lately missed a great many books—here are nineteen which are mine—they were all intrusted to my care, and were in my shop, with a great number more that were sent to me to bind—he had 2l. 4s. or 2l. 10s. a week.





WILLIAM NEWTON
. I am shopman to Mr. Walter, of High Holborn, a pawnbroker. I produce these books—they were pledged with me by the prisoner for 8s., all at one time.
(John Field gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.
There were two other indictments against the prisoner.

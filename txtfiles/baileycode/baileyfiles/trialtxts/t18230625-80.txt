            . I am a grocer
. On the 14th of June, I was at dinner in my back parlour, heard a noise in the shop, and found my neighbour speaking to the prisoner; he asked me for a penny worth of figs - I served him; he went away - my neighbour pulled his arm aside, and found he had a quantity of penny pieces. I opened my till, and missed thirty-six. He was brought back in a few minutes with thirty-three, and said he got them in Smithfield for holding horses.

            . I live next door to Wiseman. I saw the prisoner at the end of his counter, which is not the place for customers; he was coming round from behind it. I stood at the door, and directly he saw me, he asked for a penny worth of figs, and as he passed me at the door I asked where he got the penny pieces, which laid all along his arms - he said they were his own, and I let him go. Wiseman opened his till, and missed three shillings. I fetched him back, and found he had thirty-three; they were then in his pocket.
Prisoner's Defence. I took them in Smithfield; I go there every Monday and Friday. I went to the shop for figs.

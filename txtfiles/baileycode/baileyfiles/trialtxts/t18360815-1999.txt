THOMAS WILLIAM REDFORD
. I am a policeman. On Tuesday morning, the 26th of July, I was in St. Andrew-terrace, Waterloo-road, about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner sitting down upon the steps of a door, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's with some bundles—I asked how she came by them—she said they were her own property—I took her to the station-house, and she then said she had taken them from this house—I found this property on her and went to the prosecutor's.






MARGARET SUTTON
. I am the wife of Benjamin Sutton. I take in washing—these articles are mine—I hung the shawl on a nail, and the shirts and handkerchiefs were in a mangle in a room down stairs—I saw them safe at six o'clock in the afternoon, and missed them between six and seven o'clock next morning—I have no lodgers—my door was latched, not locked—it could be opened outside by lifting the latch up—I never saw the prisoner before—I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock at night—the house was found all right.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN STEPHENS. I live in Fleet-street. On the 25th of August, I was on Ludgate-hill


 - I had a handkerchief in my pocket - I felt, and missed it - I turned and saw the prisoner putting it into his pocket - I seized him - he threw it down, and told me he had not taken it, but I had seen it in his hand, and he was in the act of putting it into his left pocket.
Prisoner. Q. Did I not say that two men before me threw it on me? A. No; you said you knew nothing about it, and you had not got it.

            . I was in Ludgate-street, that evening - I saw Mr. Stephens turn suddenly back, and I saw the prisoner with the handkerchief in his possession - he threw it down when Mr. Stephens turned round.
Prisoner. When this gentleman was at Bow-street, he said he thought he saw it in my possession. Witness. No, I did not.

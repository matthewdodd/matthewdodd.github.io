             sworn.
I lost an anvil, on the 13th of this instant, about one in the morning; and one of my men lost a piece of steel belonging to 
               
                  Joseph

            ; the anvil was found by one Clark, the next morning.

             sworn.
I went to the barber's to have my hair dressed; says I, the man is gone without his basket; I looked in it, and saw an anvil and a bar of iron; I went to the publick-house and saw a man asleep over a pennyworth of purl; I awoke him, and he said, he had it from Bethnal-green.
TIMOTHY GRAY sworn.
I am a barber;

             sworn.
I produce the anvil; Clark and Gray were present when I received it.
(The anvil produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Going along, I stopped and I saw the basket; it had an anvil in it; I took it and carried it into the barber's shop and meant to have it advertised, and Gray wanted to buy it, but I would not consent to it; then Clark and Gray came to the publick-house and sent for a constable and took me up to a Magistrate, and I was committed.

               Transported for seven years

            . I live at Mile-end



; I lost eleven turkeys and four fowls between the 7th and 8th of this month; I came on the 12th to Leaden-hall market, I was told there were three men taken up for stealing wild ducks, I was told they were in New Prison; I went there, and saw the three prisoners there; Mitchell desired to speak with me by myself; I went aside with him; he asked me if I did not live at Mile-end; I said I did; he said he and the other two with him took my turkeys; I asked him how he could get into the house to them (it was formerly a dwelling-house) he said he and one of the others got into the cellar; and got up between the quartering into the house, where they were confined, between three and four in the morning, on the 8th of this instant, and they took eleven turkeys and four fowls, and they handed them down into the cellar, and tied their legs, and carried them to Leaden-hall market and sold them.
Q. Were the turkeys in good case?
Balsh. They were very good turkeys; he said he sold five of them for 11 s. and six for 14 s. and the four fowls for 3 s. 6 d. I never spoke to either of the two other prisoners.

            . I went with the prosecutor to the prison, on the 12th of February instant; Mitchell took him into the yard, and said he wanted to speak with him; what he said I do not know, but after that we went into a little room by the gate; there I heard him say, he and one of the other got in by breaking a hole, and they took the turkeys and fowls, and sold them at Leadenhall, as Mr. Balsh has said before.

            . I bought four live turkeys for 10 s. and the odd one, which he called his best, I bought for a shilling, that was dead; I believe I bought them of Simmons; it was on Monday morning the 8th of this instant; there were two or three of them together, I never saw them before or since till to day.
Q. What are you?
Humphreys. I am a ticket-potter; I served my time to the trade of a poulterer.

            . I am a poulterer; last Monday was fortnight, going up to my stall, I saw this witness and another handling eleven turkeys; there were six left; I bought them of the prisoner Taylor for 14 s. I took them to my stall, and said, I have no money now, call by and by and I will give it you; after that he came to me and asked for the money, and said he had four chickens, for which he asked 3 s. 6 d. then he said 3 s. he said he brought them from Malden in Essex; I paid him the 14 s. and 3 s. for the fowls.

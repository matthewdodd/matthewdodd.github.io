GEORGE GREEN. I live in Long-alley


; the prisoner lodged with my mother. On the 6th of December, I saw my watch safe at five minutes before eight o'clock in the morning - the prisoner was then sitting on the bed putting on his trowsers - I dropped asleep again, and when I awoke, he was gone, and my watch too - it was not more than three minutes after eight o'clock when I missed him - my brother was in the same room, but he was in bed - I afterwards saw the prisoner in Shoreditch - I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him to come back to my mother's, which he did, and I gave him into custody - he said he had sold the watch in Bristol.

             (police-constable G 162). I was sent for to the prosecutor's house - I found the prisoner there - he said to the prosecutor, "I thought you agreed to take 3s. a week" - the prosecutor said, "No, I will give you in charge" - and in going along, he said, two or three times, he would give 3s. a week.

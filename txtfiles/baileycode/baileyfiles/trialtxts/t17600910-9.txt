Q. Did you ever find them again?

Q. Where did you find the other things?
Shaw. I found them at Mr. Barnaby's.
Q. How came you to know where they were?
Shaw. I found the prisoner at Pancras, and charg'd her with taking them; and she told me she had pawn'd them at them two places.
Q. How did she come by them?

Shaw. She said she took them out of my house, and she designed to get a little money on them, and to get them again as soon as she could.
Q. Had the prisoner use to come to your house?
Shaw. Yes, she did; and used to scower my pots sometimes.
Q. What are you?
Shaw. I keep a public house; she was a sort of a chair-woman.

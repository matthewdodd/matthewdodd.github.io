            . I live at No. 19, in the Minories


. This happened on the 17th of January, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I went into the yard, almost opposite the shop door. I heard the shop door open; I went back into the shop as speedily as I could; I saw the prisoner at the bar with a piece of cloth on his shoulder, which he immediately threw down. I caught hold of him by the coat and waistcoat, and he made an ineffectual struggle to get from me. In the struggle, he broke two windows. I brought him into the house myself.

            . On the 22d of July I was at Sadler's Wells theatre


, towards the end of the play. I lost my handkerchief, and 1l. 5s. out of my pocket. I heard some person had been taken up, went to the office, and found the prisoner in custody. The officer produced my handkerchief to me as soon as I missed it.

            . I am an officer. I was in the pit of the theatre, it being a benefit night, and saw the prisoner, and several others in his company, feeling people's pockets. Some person intimated that he suspected the prisoner. I laid hold of him, searched him, and found a handkerchief concealed in his breeches, and one which the prosecutor claimed, in his hat. He said they were both his own, and that he bought the one found in his hat in Liquorpond-street of a boy for 2s., just before he came to the theatre that evening. I put him in the watchhouse. I saw the prosecutor that evening, and showed him both the handkerchiefs and my own-he selected his own from them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

             depos'd, That the Prisoners came to him some time about last Easter, and ask'd him to sell some Oats for them, that he did assist them in selling it to Mr. Wyburn, and shar'd the Money among them, and Morris gave the Receipt as the Owner of the Goods; and that they told him it came out of an Old-Blind Woman's Barge.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Barge lay off from Bear-Key, and when the Oats came to be measur'd out, they wanted eight Quarters of the Quantity there ought to have been. It was likewise depos'd, That Perkins drew the Hatches of the Lighter at the taking out the Oats, and took part of the Money: The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

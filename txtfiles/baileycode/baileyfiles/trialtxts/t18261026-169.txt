JOHN LEWIS. I am a tailor
, and live in Silver-street, Bouverie-street; I met the prisoner in West-street, Saffron-hill


, at eleven o'clock on the 14th of October; she asked me to go with her - I refused; she then snatched my watch from my fob - the chain broke, and I got a part of it; I saw her give it to a woman who stood close behind her - she went away; I seized the prisoner, and gave her in charge. I have not found the watch.
Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Were you sober? A. Yes; it was not very light - I am certain she snatched it - I had been with no woman that night.

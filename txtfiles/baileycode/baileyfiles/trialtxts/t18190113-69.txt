            . I am servant to Mr. Eneky, a wine-merchant
. On the 14th of January, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went into a house in Jewry-street


 for some empty bottles, leaving my coat in the cart, which stood at the door. I came out in about five minutes, and missed the coat, went with Hawkins immediately, and found the prisoner coming out of Rosemary-lane with two others. I heard them say,
"separate." One of the men who was with him, stood at the door when I went in - my coat was brown. I have never found it.

            . I am servant to Mr. Lambert, Jewry-street. I saw the prisoner lurking about the cart, then saw him go and take the coat out. I went to see for the driver - he came out - I told him. The prisoner went towards Rosemary-lane. I went for an officer, but could not get one. Williams and I followed, and saw the prisoner coming out of a court leading to Rosemary-lane with two others; one of whom I saw lurking about with him, and was with him when he took it. Immediately as they saw us, I heard them say to each other,
"separate." They parted. The prisoner walked a little way - I took him. I am sure he is the man - I knew him before.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it.

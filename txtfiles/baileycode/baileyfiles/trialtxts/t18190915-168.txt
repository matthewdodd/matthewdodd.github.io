            . I am a tailor
, and live at Hatton-wall. On the 11th of August, about a quarter after nine o'clock in the evening, I was near the Jolly Coopers, Clerkenwell-close


. I was leaving the corner, when theprisoner ran by and snatched my watch from my fob. I followed him - he ran as far as the gate of Clerkenwell prison, and threw it down. I picked it up, and secured him - I was quite sober.

            . I live in John's-court - I was with Hemmings. The prisoner came by, and snatched his watch - I saw him drop it, and am sure he is the person.

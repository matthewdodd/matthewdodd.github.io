            . I am a watchmaker
, and employed in Cheapside; I live in Westmoreland-buildings, City-road. On the 17th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Chiswell-street


 and I felt a pull at my coat pocket - on turning round, I saw the prisoner close to my elbow; I accused him of taking my handkerchief out of my pocket - he asked what handkerchief I meant - I said, "The handkerchief you took from my pocket" - he said he had not got it; I took him to the station-house, and on the road he gave it me.
Prisoner. Q. Did I not give it you immediately you asked for it? A. No; I accused him of it three times before he gave it me.
NEAL LYNCH. I am a Policeman. The prisoner was brought to the station-house, about half-past eight o'clock, with the handkerchief; Ladd gave the same account as he has now.(Property produced and sworn to.)

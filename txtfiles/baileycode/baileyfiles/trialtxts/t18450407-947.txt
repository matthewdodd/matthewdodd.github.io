FRANCIS KIRBY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
29th of March, 7 1/2lbs. weight of beef, value 9s. the goods of 



William James Orchard; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES KING
 (policeman.) On Saturday night, the 29th of March. about half-past ten o'clock, I was on duty in Crown-lane, North-end, Fulham, and saw the prisoner standing about twelve yards from Mr. Orchard's shop—I watched him, and saw him crawl on his hands and knees about twelve yards, to the shop door, take a piece of beef, and crawl back in the same position—he went about fifty yards—I went after him—when he saw me coming close to him he threw the beef down, and ran away—he ran about a mile before I caught him but I was not above a yard from him all the way.





WILLIAM JAMES ORCHARD
. I am a butcher, living at North-end. Fulham. King brought me a piece of beef on Saturday night, which I had put on the block about half an hour before—I missed it just as he came in with it.

Prisoners Defence. I was in liquor, or I should not have done it, and I did not know I had done it till the policeman told me.






JAMES KING

re-examined. He was not in liquor—he ran very fast for a mile.





ALEXANDER MCCASKERY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate from this Court of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 24th October, 1842, of larceny; after a previous conviction; confined one year)—I was present at both the trials, and know the prisoner to be the person.




GUILTY

HENRY WHITE
 and 




WILLIAM SMITH
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
18th of August, 1 basket, value 1s. 6d. and 3 1/2 lbs. weight of butter, value 3s. 6d.; the goods of 



Edward Kenward; and that Smith had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD KENWARD
. I am a carrier from London to Fletching, in Sussex. On the 18th of August I had this butter safe in a hamper under my cart at Bermonsdey—I got up to ride, and when I came to Thomas-street, a person asked if I had lost any thing, and I missed the basket of butter.





SAMUEL MANLEY
. I live in Maze-pond—I saw the carrier sitting at the far end of his cart, at the back of Guy's-hospital—I saw the hamper, slung under the cart on the left-hand side—I saw Smith at the side of the cart—he had hold of the shafts, but could not get the basket—White then went round, and got the basket out of the hamper—they walked away down Thomas-street—I told the carrier, and went after the prisoners, but missed them—I saw them together afterwards in Berraondsey-street—they had not the basket then—I am sure they are the persons—I knew them before.





RICHARD FULLER
 (police-constable M 120.) I received information, and took the prisoners—I told them they were charged with stealing butter—they made no answer.

White's Defence. I was going to the market, and met this man; I spoke to him; the officer came, and said he wanted me on suspicion of stealing butter; I said I had not seen any.





ROBERT CRAMPTON
 (police-constable M 248.) I produce a certificate of Smith's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the peace for Surrey—(read)—I know he is the person.

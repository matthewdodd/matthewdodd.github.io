, was a shoemaker
; the two prisoners came in to buy a pair of shoes for Tooley, that in the time he observed T - to take two pair of shoes and put them in his pockets; that he took one pair out of his pocket as he was going, and took hold of his coat and said, he should not go, for he had another pair about him, he then threw down a pair of shoes, then the prosecutor gave him a kick of the breech and let him go; soon he saw they were not the shoes he missed; that after they were gone, he missed three pair; Tooley was taken and brought back, and had but 2 s. about him.

             deposed, he felt two pair of shoes in T - 's pocket-lining as he came out at the prosecutor's door.
T - in his defence said, when Tooley had tried on a pair of shoes, he said he would put them in his pocket, and Tooley said he would pay for them; the prosecutor told him, he had stole them and took them from him, and gave him a kick of the backside and bid him go like a scoundrel, then he took up a pair of shoes from the bench and threw at him.
Tooley said, he was trusted in his business with silver of great value, as he was a polisher of silver, and was far from being so mean to steal a pair of shoes.

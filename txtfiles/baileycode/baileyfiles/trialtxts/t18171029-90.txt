MARY COLEMAN. On the 3d of October I was selling my fruit, opposite Mr. Davies's door, in Ratcliff-highway


, I saw three men go up to the door, and take off the cotton which hung there-the prisoner took it down, and put it under his coat. I gave the alarm; he ran away, and dropped it - I picked it up, and gave it to Strand. I swear I saw him take it.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Davies, who is a linen-draper, and lives at Ratcliff-highway. I heard the alarm, ran out, saw the prisoner running, with the cotton, and stopped him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

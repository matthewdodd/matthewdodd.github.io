1488. 




GEORGE GREEN
 was indicted

for feloniously forging and ultering on the 
4th of May a certain receipt for 5l. 11s., with intent to defraud 



Edward Dennis Lawless, and that he had been before convicted of felony.


MR. PHILLIPS
conducted the Prosecution.






EDWARD DENNIS LAWLESS
. I am a bookseller. The prisoner was in my service—on the 4th of May I gave Mrs. Lawless four sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and some silver, to pay Messrs. Sherwood a bill—some days afterwards the prisoner left my service without any notice.





PATIENCE LAWLESS
. My husband left this money with me—I gave it to the prisoner to pay Messrs. Sherwood—he returned about an hour afterwards, gave me this memorandum, and told me he had had it receipted as I had told him.

MR. LAWLESS
re-examined. I am positive this memorandum is in the prisoner's hand-writing—I have seen him write often.





JOHN FORSTER
. I am clerk to Sherwood and Co. The prisoner did not pay me any money on their account on the 4th of May—the name "John Forster" to this memorandum is not my hand-writing—I know nothing about it—(read)—"Received 5l. 11s., for Sherwood and Co. 



JOHN FORSTER
."





BENJAMIN GARRET
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday the 9th of June, on Newington Causeway.

Prisoner's Defence. I went and paid the money to one of the young men in the shop—I am not well acquainted with any of them.





JOHN FORSTER

re-examined. It is not the hand-writing of any person in our employ—there is no other Forster there.





THOMAS HODGES
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the party who was convicted—I was present at the trial.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)


Before Mr. Justice Littledale.

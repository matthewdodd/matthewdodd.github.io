JOSEPH PAINE. I was going through Newport-market


, about four o'clock, on the 14th of November, the prisoner and two men, followed me; I felt a hand in my pocket, I turned round, and saw the prisoner take my handkerchief out, and hand it to another man. I charged the prisoner with taking it, and he told me to search him. I followed him till he came to Little Earl-street, and seeing some people about, I gave the alarm, and he ran away; he was secured. I never lost sight of him, I am sure he is the man. I saw my handkerchief in his hand.

            . I am single. On the 11th or 12th of December I owed Mr. Vernon 4s. 10 1/2d. for beer, which I paid to the prisoner for him, and he gave me this bill, and receipted it in my presence.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was that all you owed his master? A. No. I had paid the prisoner a great many times; I have sometimes paid him a part of my account, to give his master; he never told me he was liable for the whole account.

            . I am the wife of William Vernon - he keeps the Robin Hood and Little John public-house
, at Hoxton. The prisoner was our pot-boy
: I gave him this bill to deliver to Miss Brockwill; he never brought the money to me.
Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About two months; he has received a great many accounts for us, but I never knew him to pay the whole of an account when he had received but a part of it.

                  VERNON
               




            . The prisoner never paid me this bill from Miss Brockwill; it was his duty to pay my wife every day, when he came home, after the dinner, and after the supper beer; he may have received 9s. or 10s. in a day.
JURY to CHARLOTTE VERNON. Q. How did you know this money had been received? A. I told a person that when their bill was paid I would give them a Christmas-box; they said they owed me nothing; I then made inquiries, and found this out.

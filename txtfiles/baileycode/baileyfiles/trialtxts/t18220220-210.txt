            . I am fourteen years old. My father is a butcher
, and lives in East-street, Clerkenwell


. I saw the prisoner take the beef off the board, and run off. I am sure he is the man - it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening.

            . I am the son of the prosecutor. I was in the parlour - my sister saw the beef taken, and said,
"There is a man has took the beef." I ran out and caught the prisoner at the top of Bath-street - he had not got it then - there was two of them; the other ran off with it - he said he was running after the other.

. On the 28th of March the Police-officer brought the prisoner to my house and searched him; I saw one of these candlesticks taken from his hat - the officer had two in his hand: I had seenthem safe about six o'clock that evening - this was about half-past one.

            . On the morning of Sunday, the 28th of February, I was going up Princes-street, and saw the prisoner and twenty or thirty young men with him; I went up and saw one of these candlesticks sticking out of his coat; I asked what he had got; he said a candlestick, and he was going to get a light - I felt, and found it hard- I found this candlestick under his coat; I said, "This won't do;" he struck me, and tried to get away - I seized him, and knocked at the door; another officer came to my assistance, and we got him in - he was very violent, and struck me again; I was forced to hold him down on the ground while the other officer searched him.

            , the 26th of June
 last. It appeared by the Evidence, that the Goods were pack'd up in a Box, and carried to a Carter to be convey'd to Hampstead, and that they were taken out of the Cart, and were afterwards found upon the Prisoner in Kentstreet, who could give no better Account how he came by them, than that a Man, who was a Stranger, met him in Holbourn, and promis'd to give him a Shilling to carry them to Kentstreet, and when he was come there, ran away from him; but this appearing but a Newgate Plea, and that he himself did not carry the Goods to Kentstreet, but that they were brought by a Woman, to whom he desir'd the Man of the House where he set them up, to pay 2 d. for bringing them. The Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

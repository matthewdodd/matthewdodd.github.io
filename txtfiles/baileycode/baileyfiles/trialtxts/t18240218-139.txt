            . I live in this house. About eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked for Mr. Sharp - I asked him in; he went up to our room, and said he was to meet Sharp between eleven and twelve o'clock. Hobbs's room was on the ground floor - I went into the next room, and in five minutes he was gone; I missed two shillings from my drawer. I ran down, but could not see him.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of Sept, 4 yards of calico, value 8d.; 7 yards of printed cotton, 2s. 4d.; and 30 kaleidoscopes, 7s. 6d.; the goods of 



Thomas Marvin.






SARAH HALL
. I am a widow, and live in Fair-street, Stepney. I had some calico and cotton on the 19th of Sept.—it belonged to my son, Thomas Marvin, and it was in a shed—I saw it safe on the night of the 18th of Sept.—this is it.





SIMON WILSON
 (police-constable K 230.) I took the prisoner about a quarter to eight o'clock on the evening of the 19th of Sept.—he was in charge of Viton—I found six tiles had been removed from the roof of the shed—I found on the prisoner these four toys and this other property—this calico and cotton were on the roof of the shed—I went into the shed, and found he had got a step-ladder and put it up to the roof—he said it was the first time he had ever been there.





BENJAMIN VITON
. I heard the rattling of the tiles, and saw the prisoner ascending out of the top of the roof—I asked what he was doing—he said, "Nothing"—I took him, and sent for the officer—these things were tied up in two bundles; one was on the tile and the other by the prisoner's side.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years—Parkhurst.


Fifth Jury, before Edward Bullock, Esq.

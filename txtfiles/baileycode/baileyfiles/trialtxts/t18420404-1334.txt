1334. 




MARY SMITH
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of March, 1 bonnet, value; 1 quilt, value; and 2 piece of blanket, value; the goods of 



Mary Ann Groves.






MARY ANN GROVES
. I am a widow, living in Monmouth-street. I have a room in a lodging-house—I went out on this night three weeks, at eight o'clock, and locked my door with a padlock—I returned about half-past ten, found the padlock off the door, my room in confusion, and missed a cap, a bonnet, an apron, a black silk handkerchief, and a half handkerchief, two pieces of blanket, a bed-quilt, two shifts, and a petticoat—they were quite safe before I went out—I found some lucifer matches on the table, some burnt, and some not burnt—they were not there when I went out—I saw my bonnet the day after, banging up for sale a few doors from where I live—I told the person the bonnet was mine—this is my bonnet, blanket, and quilt produced.





MARY ANN BUCKLEY
. I am the wife of William Buckley, a painter and glazier. I deal in old clothes. Between eight and nine o' clock on this night three weeks, the prisoner came to my shop with two pieces of blanket, which I gave her 7d. for—she went, and returned again within half-an-hour, and offered me this bonnet, and a mourning-cap with it for sale—she asked a shilling for them—I did not purchase them—a few days afterwards she sold me a piece of patchwork for 1s. 2d., and she told me she had exchanged flower-pots for the things—I took these pieces of blanket to Marlborough-street as soon as I beard of the robbery.





ROBERT HIBBS
. I took the prisoner into custody—she was selling old clothes at an old clothes-shop—she said nothing.


Prisoner's Defence. I did not offer the woman the bonnet; she was not at the office; it was a man who said he knew me by my black bonnet; I had no black bonnet.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

CHARLES STRATFORD
. I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in Gloucester place, Hackney. About the 1st or 2nd of Dec., 1844, I had a chimney. sweeping machine safe at my house—I missed it about the 5th—on the 6th of Jan., 1845, about a month after I had missed it, I found fifteen of the rods of the machine—these are them—I know them because I made the whole of them myself—several of the rods are hollow canes—one of them has my name stamped on it—I found these at Wilson's—I do not know the prisoner.

Prisoner. Q. What do you know the rods by? A. Here is the one that had my name stamped on it, but it has been nearly filed out since it was stolen—I stamped it with "C. S. D."—here is one which is very remarkable—I bought these rods, and put the ferrules on myself—I have seen some hundreds, and I hardly ever saw one like this—here is part of the D to be seen—I can swear to every one of these fifteen rods—there were twenty-four rods taken away.





MARY ANN WILSON
. I live in Morton-street, Newington-causeway—my husband is a chimney-sweeper. The prisoner came to me just before last Christmas twelvemonth—he asked if my husband would buy a few sticks—I said my husband was not at home—he met my husband coming from Smith. field market, and he bought the rods of him, in my presence—these are them—they have been from me these sixteen months.





WILLIAM WALKER
 (police-constable H 132.) I took the prisoner—he said, "It is all up with me now: this is Saturday night too."




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(The prisoner was convicted of felony in Feb., 1845.)

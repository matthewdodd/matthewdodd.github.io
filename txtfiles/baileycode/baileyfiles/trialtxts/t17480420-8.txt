            . On Tuesday the 29th of March I was passing along between Cornhill


 and Exchange Alley


, and missed my handkerchief; I turned round to see who was the most likely person to take it, and I saw the Prisoner endeavouring to skreen himself in the croud; I took hold of his arm, and he was stuffing a handkerchief which I knew to be mine into his bosom; this is the handkerchief, the Prisoner's mother said that he is got into ill company, and it would be worse for him if he did not go to sea.

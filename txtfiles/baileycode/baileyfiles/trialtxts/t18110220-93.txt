. On the 6th of this month, about a quarter past six in the evening, I observed the prisoner coming towards the door; I was about a yard within the shop; he snatched from the side of the window the pelisse that was hanging for sale; I saw him, and pursued him with the cry of stop thief; we caught him in a passage in Earl's-court with the pelisse upon him.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from my friends in Whitcomb-street, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the man, I followed him. As I was going through the court the man knocked me down; they came up and said it was me. They picked up the pelisse from the ground.

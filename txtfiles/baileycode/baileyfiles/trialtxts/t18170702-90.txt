            . I am a constable. On the 3d of June, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners passed my window in Castle-street, Leicester-square; Steward had a bundle concealed under his coat; I went out and overtook them, and asked them what they had got, Steward said it was nothing; I took the bundle from him, and found two trusses; I asked him where he got them, he said, from a broker's shop in Duke's-court; he said he was going to take them to Monmouth-street to the woman's brother. I secured them, and found they belonged to Edy.

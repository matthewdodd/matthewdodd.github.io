            . I am a street-keeper. On the 1st of January I was in Euston-square, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran up, and saw the prisoner running - he threw away two quart pots; a man stopped him; I took him and the pots to Winton's - he then said he had two more, and I found two pint pots in his jacket pockets.

            . I keep the Euston Arms
. These pots are mine - I do not know the prisoner.

GERRARD ELLIS
. I am a carpenter. On the 28th of February, the night the Queen went to Covent-garden theatre, I went to see her come out—I felt a press against me, and saw the prisoner behind me—I felt my handkerchief safe then—my little brother was with me—I lifted him up to see the Queen pass—I felt a press behind me at that time, and the policeman asked me if I had lost any thing—I said, "Yes, my handkerchief—the prisoner had then gone from the place where he had been standing before—I told the policeman I thought the man with the short pipe, (meaning the prisoner,) had got the handkerchief—he went and took him—the handkerchief has not been found.





ROBERT BURR
. I am an officer. I was on duty in St. James's-street, and saw the prisoner and another try several pockets, then go behind the prosecutor, and feel his pocket—I saw the prisoner put his right hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take out the handkerchief, and give it to the other, who went off—I then spoke to the prosecutor.

Prisoner's Defence. The mob was dispersed before the officer took me, he said I had robbed the gentleman, and I said I had not.





FREDERICK TULL
 (police-constable A 183.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

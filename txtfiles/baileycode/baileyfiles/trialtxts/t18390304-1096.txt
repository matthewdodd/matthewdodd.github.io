ISABELLA COOK
. I am single, and live with my brother-in-law, John George Weston, a tobacconist, in Queen-street, Holborn. On Tuesday, the 5th of March, I was in the parlour at the back of the shop, and saw something hang down the front of the counter—I went and saw the prisoner on the counter, with his hand round the glass case, with one bundle of cigars on his arm, and getting another—I went up to him, touched him, and called "Stop thief"—he jumped up and ran out—I followed, but was not able to overtake him—he was brought back almost directly—I have not a doubt he is the person.





SAMUEL TOPLIFP LUCY
. I lire opposite the prosecutor. I was in my shop and saw the prisoner looking through his window—I then saw him go in and then run out, with Cook after him—I pursued and brought him back—he is the person I saw go in and come out.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

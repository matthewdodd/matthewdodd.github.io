THOMAS STONEHAM
. About half-past eight o'clock, on the 18th of November, I was walking through Houndsditch, and heard Sarah Peake say something—I turned, and my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner running across the road—I pursued—George Plant overtook him in Cutler-street, where he had run—this handkerchief was handed to me—it is mine.





SARAH PEAKE
. I was passing through Houndsditch, and saw Mr. Stoneham and two gentlemen passing—I was the next person behind them—I saw the prisoner and another meet these three gentleman; and after they

passed, they turned round instantly, and his prisoner got close to the middle gentleman, who is not here; he then made a signal to the other one, and drew a pale yellow silk handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he dropped it, and ran across the road—I told the gentleman—he was pursued, and taken—he was out of sight as he turned a corner, but I am positive he is the person.





GEORGE PLANT
. I was walking with Mr. Stoneham—before Peake touched me on the shoulder, the prisoner was running across the road—I immediately pursued him—I did not see him drop any thing—I collared him—he bit me on my thumb—I threw him on his back, and kept him till the officer came—the night officer brought up the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from my uncle's, and was taken—I am innocent.

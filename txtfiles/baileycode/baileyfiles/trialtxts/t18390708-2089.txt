JOHN OXMAN
 was again indicted

 for bigamy.






JOSEPH AXFORD
. I am brother to Amelia Axford—she married the prisoner on the 5th of April, 1818, at St. George's, Bloomsbury—my sister is alive.

Prisoner. Q. Did not she strip me of every thing? A. I know nothing about it.





HENEAGE PARKER CATTERNS
. I am parish clerk of St. George, Bloomsbury. I have the register of the marriage of John Oxman and Amelia Axford, on the 5th of April, 1818.





SARAH TRUMP
. I have been acquainted with the prisoner for twelve months—I married him on the 7th of January last, at St. George, Bloomsbury—he represented himself as a widower—I had kept a coffee-shop in Judd-street—I had a good business, which I have been obliged to give up since I have known him, to pay my way—I am in the family way by him—I found out that he was married about two months since.





HENEAGE PARKER CATTERNS
. I have the register of the marriage of John Oxman and Sarah Trump, on the 7th of January, 1839, at St. George, Bloomsbury—I know the party, and saw the marriage.

Prisoner. My first wife absconded from me, and then she would not let me come home—I was eight years in the hospital and workhouse, and when I went home she got a neighbour to turn me into the street—next day I was forced to go to the workhouse—her ill treatment made me marry my second wife, and my first wife came to annoy us—I then parted—and then she came to my last wife, and got her to come against me.




GUILTY
. Aged 53.—


Transported for Seven Years.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

SUSANNAH BRIGGS
. I am a widow, and keep a grocer's shop at New Brentford. On the 10th of May as I came from my parlour into my shop, I saw the prisoner creeping on his hands and knees from behind the counter where my till was kept, towards the door—I picked him up and tent for the police—I observed my till on the floor—he must have put it there—it was in its place before he came into the shop—I missed a four-penny-piece from it, which I found behind a butter tub—I know it by a stock which was on it—it had been used as a button—there was other money in the till which was not taken out.





JOHN HANSLOW
. I am a policeman. I was sent for to the shop, and took the prisoner into custody—I found this new knife on him.




GUILTY

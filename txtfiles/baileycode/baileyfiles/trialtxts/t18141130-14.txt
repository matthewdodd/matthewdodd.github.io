            . I go with the cart, and mind the cart when the porter is gone away. On the 7th of November, about eleven at noon, when I came to the 
               
                  Flower 
                  Pot
               



            , Bishopsgate-street, I met the porter there; the porter took two parcels out of the cart to deliver. I stood against a house opposite of the cart. I saw the prisoner take a parcel off the cart; I hallooed out stop thief; the prisoner looked round; as soon as he saw me, he ran through Crosby-square; I ran after him; he was stopped. I am sure he is the same man; he was brought back in about five minutes, or a little better; I am sure he is the same man.

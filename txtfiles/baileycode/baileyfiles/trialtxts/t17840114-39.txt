I am apprentice to a turner, I saw the prisoner at a chandler's shop the corner of Bluecoat-fields


, and I saw him go past Butler's door backwards and forwards, then he went in tip-toed, and he took the barrel of butter in his arms, ran the other side of the way, and pitched it on the ground, and stood before it; I went and told the man of the shop of it, and he came out and the prisoner was taken while he was standing before it.

                  John 
                  Hurdle 
               



            . I live on Finchley-common; on the 15th of August I sent my servant, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Deman 
               



            , with a cart load of hay to Whitechapel market, and I never heard of it more; he can give your lordship a farther account. I had lost another load the same way about a twelve-month ago.


                  Richard 
                  Deman 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Hurdle; on the first day of Barnet races, I came to London with a load of hay. Going to Whitechapel market, the prisoner came to me in Bishopsgate-street


, and told me he came from my Master, and said my master ordered me to deliver the hay to him, and took hold of my fore horse, and bid me follow him, and he would lead me to the place; he went down by London-wall, there he bid me stop, till he came again; he came again, and drawed it into the White-bear yard, and unloaded the hay into a loft.
Q. Did you sell it to him?
R. Deman. No, I did not.
Q. Who unloaded it?
R. Deman. I did.
Q. Does the prisoner keep that inn?
R. Deman. No.
Q. Did he talk of paying you for it?
R. Deman. No, he did not; but I said I must either have money or a note, as I always have either one or the other. After it was unloaded, he had me to a butcher, who wrote a note by the prisoner's order; he said he could neither write nor read.
Q. Can you write ?
R. Deman. I can neither write nor read. He gave me the note the butcher wrote.
Q. Did he say he had bought the hay of your master?
R. Deman. No, he did not.
Q. Do you know the keeper of the White-bear inn ?
R. Deman. No, I did not then.
Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the man?
R. Deman. I am.


                  William 
                  More 
               



            . I am a butcher, and live in Aldersgate street. I know the prisoner at the bar.
Q. Does he live in your neighbourhood.
W. More. No, he does not.
Q. What business does he follow?
W. More. I don't know that; he came to our shop, and asked for a pen and ink; I let him have one : then he asked me to write, Received 1 l. 15 s. and six-pence to spend, and a name; which I did.

Prosecutor. Yesterday, as I was pulling out my papers, I lost the note my man brought home at that time; but I remember it was these words and figures,
Received a load of hay 1 l. 15 s. 6 d.


                  John 
                  Young 
               



            . Noble-street.
Q. to More. Did the prisoner sign the note?
W. More. I know not that; I only wrote it, and he went away along with the carter.
Q. Where is the landlord of the White-bear?
Prosecutor. He has been attending here, and is gone home for a little time, as he told me.
Q. How came you to take the prisoner up?
Prosecutor. He was put in Bridewell for another such fact, and I heard of it, and I took Deman to see if he knew him; when we came there, the prisoner was making water: as soon as Deman saw him, as we were going in at the gate, he said, that is the man that is making water against the tub.
Prisoner's defence.
I never had the hay at all, or saw the man till I saw him in Bridewell; he is mistaken in the man; I am a labouring man, and work in a gang of coal-heavers.
To his character.


                  John 
                  Crosby 
               



            . I have known the prisoner I believe about a year and a half; he drove carts; I never knew but what he behaved very well; he lived in White-friars.



               Guilty
            .
There were two other indictments against him for crimes of the same nature.

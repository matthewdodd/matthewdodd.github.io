WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of May, 73lbs. weight of lead, value 5s.; and 2 metal cocks, value 1s., the goods of 



Isaac Cranfield, and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.






ISAAC CRANHELD
. I live in Hare-street, Bethnal-Green. I have a house in Middlesex-street, Hackney-road—I missed some lead pipe, and two cocks from it on the 27th of May—I believe these to be them.





JAMES COOK
 (police-constable H 7.) On the 27th of May, in the middle of the night, I met the prisoner in Hackney-road with this lead—I found this ball left on the premises, and it exactly fits this part where it has been broken from—I had seen this lead all correct at the house three quarters of an hour before.

Prisoner. I was coming home, and saw this in a short street leading out of the road—I took it up.




GUILTY
 Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

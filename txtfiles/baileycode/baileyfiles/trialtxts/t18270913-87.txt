                     WILLIAM 
                     COOKE
                  




               
             was indicted for 


               embezzlement
            .


                  JOHN 
                  SMITH
               



            . I deal with the prosecutor. On the 14th of April I paid the prisoner two sovereigns on their on account; he wrote a receipt on the bill, which I have here - I frequently paid him money on their account.


                     CHARLES 
                     SMITH
                  



               
            . I am in partnership with 
               
                  
                     Edward 
                     Trimnell
                  



               
            ; we are gold-lace makers

 - the prisoner was in our employ, and received money for us; it was his duty to bring it directly to me or my partner; he did not. On the 14th of April he did not pay us any money whatever for Mr. John Smith - I am certain we never received this amount.
Prisoner's Defence. I acknowledge my offence; it was through pride and folly that I did it - I thought I should be able to replace it.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 20.




               Transported for Fourteen Years
            .
There were three other indictments against the prisoner.

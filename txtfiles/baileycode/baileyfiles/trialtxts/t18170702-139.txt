            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of June, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was called by the servant of No. 36, Sloane-square, who said she was sure some persons were in the next house. I went into the area and found the door open; I then went up to the top floor, and heard some persons making their way out on to the roof. I found the lead in the garret. I went on to the roof, over three houses, and found the three prisoners concealed in a gutter, behind some chimneys - I tied them together, and brought them down; I met Maybank in the house coming to assist me. I found two knives and a screw-driver, with the lead. I saw the lead fitted afterwards.
RICHARD MAYBANK. I went up and found the prisoners on the roof with Reynolds, we took them to the watch-house, and fitied the lead to the house-top-it exactly fitted.

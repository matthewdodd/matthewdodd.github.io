THOMAS FINCH. I live in Pierpont-row


, and am a mason
. I let a house at Islington to the prisoner, and I have another house, three doors from it - I missed, from that house, a pair of sashes - this one I can positively swear to - I had seen it there on the Wednesday afternoon, and missed it on the Thursday morning - they are worth 9s. or 10s. each.

             (police-constable G 217). I was on duty in the City-road, on the 12th of June, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw the prisoner in Featherstone-street, with these two sashes on his shoulder - I asked him where he brought them from - he said from home, and he was going to take them over the water - I asked, "Where?" he said that was his business - I took him, and found the owner of the sashes.

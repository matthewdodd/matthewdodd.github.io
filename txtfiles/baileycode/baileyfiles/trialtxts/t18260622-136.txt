. On the morning of the 15th of June I tied these knives up, and put them in my shop-window - at nine o'clock in the morning I went out and returned about one, and they were safe then - I went to Mr. Whitbread's and heard the cry of Stop thief! I followed the cry, and met Cowling with these knives and forks in his hand.

            , JUN. I was talking to Mrs. Wren in the shop, and saw the prisoner take something from the window - I followed him - he dropped these knives and forks in an alley - I saw him stopped by Mr. Wood.(Property produced and sworn to).

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned round and saw the prisoner running - I stopped him - he said "I have got nothing" - he ran about one hundred yards after I told him to stop.

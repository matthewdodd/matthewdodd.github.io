            , a haberdasher - I was opposite Mr. Stewart's shop, in Ratcliffe-highway


, on the 17th of November, watching the prisoners and another person - I knew Brown before; they were all in company together - I saw them try several shops, particularly a wire-worker's, where they were disturbed; they then went to Mr. Stewart's - Brown stood at the corner of the window, while Pressnell went into the shop, and came out with a ham; they crossed the road, and I secured Presnell with it - Brown was holding out his apron to catch it; but he ran away when I came up - Brown returned soon after; I saw him, and he was taken.

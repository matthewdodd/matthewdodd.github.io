            .
WILLIAM BOURNE. I am a corn-chandler
, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner was employed by me occasionally - he was employed on the 13th of June to carry a bedstead to No. 28, Banner-street, St. Luke's - he had a written direction where to take it, and I paid him 1 s. 6 d. for taking it before he went. I had him taken into custody on the following Saturday: I can swear to this being the head board of it -
(examining it).

            . I live in Vine-street, Hatton-garden. The prisoner sold me a bedstead for 8 s. on the 13th of June - one of my men repaired it, and I sold it for 19 s. - this is a part of it.

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked what he had done with the bedstead; he said he was tipsy, and did not know.
Prisoner's Defence. I have been to sea, and have fractured my skull - when I get a little to drink I do not know what I do.

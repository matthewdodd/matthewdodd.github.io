            . I was partner with my late husband's father at the time the things were stolen; but he is since dead. I live at the corner of George alley in the Fleet-market


: I keep a clock and watch and silversmith's shop

. On the 16th of October last my glass in the window was cut or broke, and five gold rings were taken out, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, before dark; they lay in the window upon a drawer. I was gone backwards, and left nobody in the shop for about half an hour. There were three plain ones, one black enamelled, and one with a brown stone. I heard of them the next day between 7 and 8 in the morning.

            . I am constable of White-friars; I was sent for to the Anchor in White-friars; there was Reynolds.

            , or her husband, delivered three of the rings there to me. Reynolds said he did not take them himself, but another boy
 did; and that other boy had got two of the rings. I went to Little Britain, according to his direction, and found the other boy
 in bed upon a floor on some straw, with his mother and two other small children, in a starving condition; that was 
               
                  Peter 
                  Price 
               



            : there I found two gold rings, which he delivered to me; his mother had them in her pocket: the other three were said to have been found upon Reynolds.

                  Bateman 
               



            . On the 16th of October, about 8 in the evening, Reynolds came, as I was sitting selling fruit and oysters: there were four or five more-boys along with him. He took my candle out of my lanthorn; I asked him what he had got there: he said he had got three rings, and asked me if I would buy them. I asked him to let me see them; he had them on his finger; he took them off, and gave them into my hand. I asked him how he came by them: he said it is no matter; if I would buy them I should come to no harm: I said I did not believe they were gold. He produced a plain gold ring with a black enamel; and another, a gold twist with a brown stone; he said he was certain they were gold, by the place from whence they came; and said, he was sure there was nothing but gold where they came from; and if I thought they were too dear at 18 d. all three of them, I should have them for a shilling: upon which I desired him to stay a little. I took the rings, and went into Waterman's-lane to a pawn-broker's shop: I desired the gentleman to tell me if they were gold; he said they were. I told him which way I got them, and where the boy was. He desired me to go and get a constable and take him up. I said, I did not understand any thing of the affair; and as it was late, I would keep the rings till morning: as the boy was known about the place, I thought my husband could easily take him up in the morning. I went home and locked up the rings in a drawer, and told the boy he should have the rings if he came in the morning: he said it was very well. The next morning my husband got up between six and seven, and found the boy in the glass-house: he took him to the Blue-Anchor, and sent for Mr. Houghton, and delivered the boy and rings to him. As soon as my husband took him into the public house the boy fell a crying, and owned he took the rings from out of a clock-maker's shop, at the corner of George-alley in the Fleet-market; that Price stole them, and delivered those three to him, and kept two himself.
Reynolds's defence.
I know nothing about them.
Price's defence.
The same.

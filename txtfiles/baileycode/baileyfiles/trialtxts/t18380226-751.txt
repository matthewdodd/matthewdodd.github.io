JAMES RYAN
 and 




ROBERT EDWARDS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
10th of February, 23 printed books, value 6s.; and 5 pictures and frames, value 1s.; the goods of 




William Farlow.






SARAH FARLOW
. My husband's name is William Farlow; we keep a broker's shop in Spa-fields. On the 10th of February, a child came in

and said a man had gone up the street with some pictures in his hand—I went out, and missed the whole of my books—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—my husband gave information; and the same evening the prisoners were brought back, at five minutes before eight o'clock, with these books and prints—they were taken from inside the window; but there was a square of glass broken, and they could get them out.





ALFRED THURSTON
 (police-constable G 122.) I met the prisoner in Aylesbury-street, almost immediately after this robbery—I stopped them in Brook-hill—Ryan had got these books and pictures in his bag—I said to Ryan, "What have you got in the bag?"—he said, "Some books and pictures I bought of a boy"—I took him into custody—Edwards was about to walk off, but he was taken by another officer, in my presence.

Ryan's Defence. I bought them of a boy in Clerkenwell-green, and was going to sell them—this officer came and took me—this other boy was only asking the way to Leather-lane, and I told him—he knew nothing of it—I gave half a crown for them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

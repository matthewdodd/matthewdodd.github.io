            . I am clerk
 to a solicitor. On the 15th of April I was walking near Pentonville


, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I felt something taken from me; I turned, saw the prisoner, and seized him; he dropped my handkerchief - a person came up, and we took the prisoner; he ran away, but was taken again and given to the officer - this is my handkerchief.

            . I was going up Pentonville-hill; I saw the prosecutor coming down - the prisoner went behind him, he turned and caught hold of him, and this handkerchief fell on the ground; the prosecutor asked me to assist in taking him - he asked to be allowed to walk to the station-house; he then ran off, and we took him again.

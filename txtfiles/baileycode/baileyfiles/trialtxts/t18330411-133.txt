JOHN KENNY. I work in the provision line
. On the 6th of April I was out with a heavy load, between twelve and one o'clock; I went into a public-house to get a pint of beer - I was then going home to my rest, and met these two females, who asked me to stand some gin; I told them to go home - Tomkin then put her arms round my neck, and Wilson took my money; I called the officer and gave them into custody - I lost a shilling, two sixpences, one penny, and one halfpenny.
JOHN MURRAY (Police-constable K 178). The prosecutor charged these women with taking his money - it was about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, in the New-road, St. George's


 - I have known him some time, he is a very industrious honest man - I took the prisoners to the station; I found 6d. on Wilson - I went back to the place, and found two sixpences on the pavement.
DANIEL ENGLISH (Police-constable K 248). On the morning when the prisoners were brought to the station, Tomkin gave me a shilling while the other was being searched - she told me to get something to drink in the morning.
Tomkin. I gave him that, as he has had many more- every time he met me he asked me to give him something to drink - he received 10s. a short time ago for hiding a fault.
TOMKIN - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 27.
WILSON - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 22.

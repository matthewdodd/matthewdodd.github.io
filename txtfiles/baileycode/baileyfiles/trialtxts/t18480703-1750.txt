JAMES CANNON
 and 



JOSEPH GOBBETT



, feloniously and sacrilegeously breaking and entering the 
Church of St. Mary Magdalene, 
Southwark, and stealing 2 surplices, 2 candlesticks, 3 pints of wine, and other articles, value 5l. 19s. 8d.; the goods of 



Joseph Rutland and another; Gobbett having been before convicted.






THOMAS GARDNER
 (policeman, M 79.) On Sunday morning, 12th June, the prisoners were given in my charge—I searched their lodgings—they were

in bed—I found three pieces of lawn and two bags, and in the water-closet a duplicate of a shirt (produced.)

JOHN-RADCLIFFE (policeman, P 27,) I went with Gardner, and found several pieces of lawn cut up, and a piece of carpet, which agreed with the carpet in the vestry of St. Mary Magdalene Church, which is in the parish of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark.





MARTHA HEFFORD
. I am pew-opener at this Church. Mr. Joseph Rutland and Mr. Baker are the churchwardens—these things were safe on the night of the 11th—I left the Church last, and locked it—these things were then in their places—I went next morning, at ten o'clock, and found the vestry door open, and the lock off—I missed these things from different parts—I know them well.





ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL RUSSELL
. I am a pawnbroker, at 172, Bermondsey-strect. I produce two lawn shirts, pledged by the wife of one of the prisoners—she said she was his wife in his presence.





EMMA SMITH
. I live with Mr. Kilpin, in Grange-road. I bought this lawn (produced) of Cannon's wife—I never saw her with him.

Gobbett's Defence. I gave a sovereign for the things.





JAMES CARPENTER
 (policeman M, 95.) I produce a certificate of Gobbett's conviction—(read—Convicted March, 1848, and confined two months)—I was present—he is the man.
(Cannon received a good character.)

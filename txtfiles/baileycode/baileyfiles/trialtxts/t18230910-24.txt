            . I live at Cranbrook, and am a grocer
. On the 31st of July, about half-past one o'clock at noon, I was in Upper Thames-street


 - I felt my pocket move, put my hand down, and missed my silk handkerchief, and saw the prisoner with two others - I seized him, and charged him with taking it, which he denied. I thrust my hand up his waistcoat, and found it there, and gave him in charge.

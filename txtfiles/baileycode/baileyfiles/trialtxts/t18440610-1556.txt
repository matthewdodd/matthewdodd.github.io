On the 20th of May, about ten o'clock at night, I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoners come to the door—they each tried to take some soap from within the shop—Hearley took some, and they walked away—I ran out, calling "Stopthief!"—they ran away together up Tavistock-street—I saw Hearley with the soap—a gentleman stopped him and I stopped Ginivan, and gave them in charge.

ROBERT HARTLEY
. I am servant to William Nash, who keeps a shop in Judd-street. On the 27th of April, about twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners outside the shop for about ten minutes—I watched them, and saw Cassidy take the pins out of the top piece of a pile of prints—they then went away for about a quarter of an hour, they then came again—Cassidy took the top piece of print, and put it into Andrews's lap—they went away with it, and I stopped them—it was twenty-seven yards of printed cotton—Andrews dropped it before I stopped him—the property was brought back to our shop—it is Mr. Nash's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Cassidy sitting on the step of a door? A. No—the cloth was not in the street, it was about two yards inside the door.

JOHN WRIGHT (police-constable E 128.) I saw Cassidy take a piece of print from the top of the pile, and put it into Andrews's apron.

Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to him? A. On the opposite side of the way, between thirty and forty yards—Cassidy made his way towards Crown-street, and sat himself down on the step of a door.

CASSIDY—


GUILTY
. Aged 13.—Recommended to mercy.—



Confined Two Months.

. One day in August, the prisoner came to sweep the chimneys at six o'clock in the morning, with another person, whom I should not know - he left about a quarter past six, and in about a quarter of an hour I missed all the plate, stated in the indictment, from the kitchen cupboard, which was not locked - I had seen it all safe the night before; I have found nine of them - the prisoner went up the chimney; no other person came to the house except the prisoner, from the time I saw them till they were missed.

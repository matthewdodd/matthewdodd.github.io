            . I am a mantua-maker; I had these pieces to make up into a gown: At the time I had the bill drawn up, I could not recollect the owner's name. When they were taken away, I had nobody about me that I could suspect, but the prisoner. They were rolled up as they came from the dyer's; the prisoner was taken into custody on some other account. I went, when she was before the justice, and charged her with stealing these pieces; she owned there, that she did take and pawn them, and the place where.

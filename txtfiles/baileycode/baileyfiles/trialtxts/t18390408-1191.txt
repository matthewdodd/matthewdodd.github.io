SAMUEL THOMPSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of March, 1 sovereign and 1 half-crown, the monies of 



Joseph Cockerton his master.






JOSEPH COCKERTON
. I keep the Royal Hospital public-house, in Hospital-row, Chelsea. The prisoner was my waiter for about three months—in consequence of something, on the 17th of March, I marked five half-crowns and two sovereigns, which I put into the till in the her, at twelve o'clock at night I locked it—there was then 5l. in it—I came down at eight o'clock in the morning—the till was still locked—then was about 1l. 14s. or 1l. 15s. missing, and among it one sovereign and one half-crown, which I had marked—I sent for an officer, who searched the prisoner in my presence, and found rather more than 15l. on him, among which was the half-crown and sovereign I had marked—he said part of the money was mine and part was his own—he had no business to go to the till or into the bar.





GEORGE THATCHER
 (police-constable B 17.) I took the prisoner, and found on him 14l. 5s. 4 1/2 d.; and a silver watch, and several articles in his box—in going to the station-house he said that 8l. or 9l. of the money belonged to himself, and the remainder to his master.

Prisoner's Defence. The bar-maid was trying to do all she could to injure me, by placing money in different parts of the house, to entrap me—I did not go to the till—the bar-maid came down first—she most have taken it out of the till, and put it on the counter to entrap me.





JOSEPH COCKERTON

re-examined. I have no reason to mistrust the bar-maid—the prisoner has tried several times to make me believe it was her.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prosecutor stated he had lost 25l. or 30l.)

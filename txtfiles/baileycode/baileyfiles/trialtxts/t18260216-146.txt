            . I was near Shoe-lane, in Fleet-street, on the 2d of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I saw the prosecutor going along, and a piece of the handkerchief hanging out of his pocket; the prisoner was close after him; I tried to get across the way, but I could not for the carriages; I got across as soon as I could, and saw him turn away from the prosecutor - the handkerchief was not then hanging out; I tapped him on the shoulder and then secured the prisoner with the handkerchief in his hand.(Property produced and sworn to.)
GUILTY. Aged 18.

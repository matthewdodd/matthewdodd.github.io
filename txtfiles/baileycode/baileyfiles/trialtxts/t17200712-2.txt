             deposed, that his Master had been at Stratford, and sent him with two Horses to his Stables, and as he went through Lothbury


 a Boy ask'd him to let him ride on one of them; that the Prisoner pretending to help the Boy up, took the Pistols out of the Holsters; that he rid after him and took him, and was sure the Prisoner was the same Person. Another Evidence deposed that she saw the Prisoner take the Pistols and run away with them. The Prisoner denied the Fact and called several to his Reputation, two of whom deposed that he was crasy sometimes. But the Evidence being very full against him, the Jury found him

            , bookseller
, Panton-street, Haymarket


. On the evening of the 24th of February, I was in the parlour behind the shop with Withnell, and saw the shop door pushed against three or four times, about the distance of half a foot - I got up, but seeing that it was not sufficiently open to admit any one, I sat down, and afterwards saw it pushed open again. A person came in, and took something from the window - I ran to the door, looked down the street towards the Haymarket, and one door off saw the prisoner with this painting under his arm. Withnell ran out, and took him with it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was with the prosecutrix - she said something, and went to the door; I saw the prisoner running down the street with a picture under his arm - I followed, and brought him back with it.
Prisoner. I did it from distress.

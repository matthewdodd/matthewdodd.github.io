            . I am the wife of William Day, an auctioneer
; we live in Bishopsgate-street


 - the prisoner was three months in our service, and asked me for a holiday; I gave her one on the 1st of June - she left about twelve o'clock, and did not return till the evening of the next day; she then asked me to look over her fault in stopping out - I had given her notice, which would expire in a fortnight, and told her she might stay till I suited myself- I sent her on an errand next day, and gave her 1s.; she took an umbrella out with her, and never returned - I then examined my linen; I missed a table-cloth at first - I went round to different pawnbrokers, and found four at the pawnbrokers' - they were not in use at that time, and were kept in my bed-room; she was my only servant.

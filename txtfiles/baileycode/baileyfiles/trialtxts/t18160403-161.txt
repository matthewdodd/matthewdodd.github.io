            . I keep a mercer's shop
, at No. 75, Oxford-street


. About seven o'clock in the evening, in consequence of some information, my father ran out, and brought the prisoner back. The shawl has never been found. My father will describe what he saw. I remembered the prisoner's person from having been on the Jury at the last December Sessions when he was tried.

            's linen-draper, in Oxford-street. Going by the prosecutor's shop, I saw the prisoner at the bar and another lad larking about it. The other lad made a pull at this shawl, which was hanging up; but did not succeed in getting it down; they made several pulls at it; at last the prisoner gave it a pull, and got it down, and the other lad ran off with it; the prisoner ran up Win-law-street.

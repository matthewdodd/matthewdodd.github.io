            . I live in Silver-street, Bloomsbury


, and keep hackney coaches
. On the 9th of November last, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment: there were ten plate buttons on the coat; the prisoner was recommended to me to help me, and was with me the time I lost the things: I let him lie in the stable: he was taken up upon another affair; and in St. Giles's Round-house he told me he had taken the buttons off the coat, and sold the coat for 7 s. 6 d. and the buttons for 7 s. and he had sold the saddle to a stage-coachman for 5 s. in Holborn (the coat and buttons produced and deposed to): I found these by his direction.

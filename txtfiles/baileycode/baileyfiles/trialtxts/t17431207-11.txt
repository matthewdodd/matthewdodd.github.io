            . I am a Distiller
; Nov. 13, at Night, I was in my back Parlour, and saw the Prisoner in the Shop endeavouring to get out into the Street; I did not see her take the Till; by that Time she was got into the Street, I stepped after her, and took hold of her right Arm, and said, Mistress, what did you do in my Shop? she said, nothing : Said I, I believe you have robbed me, you must go back with me, for I will examine you. I saw something bulky under her Arm, there was the Till, and the Money in it; she owned that she took it, and begged that I would let her go about her Business. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.

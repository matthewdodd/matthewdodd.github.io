             thus depos'd. In the Dark of the Evening, as I was going over London-Bridge



, the Prisoner ran against me, and as he past by me, he put his Hand behind him, and cut my Pocket and took away 14 d. and I stopt him immediately with the Money upon him; among which was a particular Half-penny which I knew to be mine, by a Cut across the Face.
Elizabeth Green thus depos'd. About 10 in the Morning. as I was standing in a Crowd at Stocks-Market



, the Prisoner and 2 more Boys jostled against me. I felt a Prick upon my Thigh, like the Prick of a sharp Knife, upon which I lookt down, and saw the Prisoners Hand at my Pocket. I catch'd hold of him, but he got away that time. My Pocket was cut, and 9 s. 6 d. taken out of it. 


               Guilty of each to the Value of 10 d.

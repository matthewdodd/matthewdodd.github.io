JANE MARSH
. I am sister of Richard Biddel, a baker, in Compton-street. I was at his house last Tuesday evening, at a quarter before ten o'clock—I left the shop, to go into the bakehouse, leaving a little girl, seven years old, in the shop—she called out, "Mother, mother, here is a boy taking the till"—I instantly ran up into the street, and hallooed out, "Stop thief"—I found the till was gone—I saw the prisoner in about five minutes—the policeman brought him back, with the till, containing 14s. in silver, and 5s. 10 1/4 d. in copper, and a weighing-machine—that was all in the till when it was brought back—I know the prisoner—he had been into the shop just before for some stale bread.





GEORGE HOBBY
. I am a policeman. About ten o'clock at night, on the 29th of December, there was a cry of "Stop thief"—I hastened to the sound, and found the prisoner standing on the step of a door, with a till close behind him, and some silver and copper in it—I took him by the collar, and took him to the shop; the last witness recognised him as having been there before—I took him about sixty yards from the shop—the till was about a yard from him.

Prisoner. I was going home—I was not on the step of the door, nor near the shop. Witness. He was standing up at the step of the door.

             sworn.
I am a shoe-maker
; I live at No. 31, Swallow-street


; I did not then miss the shoes, till I heard they were stolen. On the 17th of September I was informed of it, and searched and found I missed four pair. The prisoner was often a customer.

             sworn.
The prisoner brought these shoes to me at different times, one pair at a time; I asked him particularly concerning them; he said, a shoe-maker was indebted to him for hair-dressing, and paid him in shoes. I lent him 3 s. a pair; that, I imagine, is pretty near the value.
(The shoes deposed to.)

               Transported for seven years

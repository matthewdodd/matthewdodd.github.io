JAMES BLACKMAN.
I am in the service of Henry Sharpe, a draper in Aldermanbury. About half-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 6th of June, I left a lad in the warehouse, and went down stairs—when I returned, I saw the prisoner going out with these two pieces of linen—he was quite a stranger, and had no right there—I followed, and saw him in Fountain-court—I ran and collared him, and took him back to the warehouse—he is the same person that I had seen step out—he had these two pieces of black Irish linen—one is thirty-one yards, and the other twenty-eight yards.





THOMAS DOWLING
(Citypolice-constable, No. 470.) I took the prisoner, and have the property.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the City, and a man asked me to carry it.

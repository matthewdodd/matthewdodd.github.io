. The prisoner lodged in my back room for seven weeks. On the 26th of December, I went out with him - we were together for two hours, he then left me. I went home soon after, and missed nine pair of boys boots. Next morning I went to look for him - he did not return to his lodging, and on Monday I found six pair at Vincent's - they were in the shop window; the shop was locked, and I had the key, but when I came home I found a window broken.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Hatton-wall. On the 26th of December, between six and seven o'clock at night, the prisoner brought two pair of boots to sell, saying he had four pair more, that his wife was at the door with them, and that he made them himself out of old boots, and lived a few miles off. I gave him 2 s. per pair for them. Richard's afterwards claimed them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met 
               Wm. Mitchell
             in Sun-street, with a woman in his company - he asked if I could tell him where to sell six pair of boys boots; I went with him to Mutton-hill, and sold them. I gave the money to the woman.

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of October I was in the New-road, and saw the prisoner with a sack on his back; Maynard, who was with him, told him I was coming, and he dropped the lead. I took it up, and left it at a butcher's shop, pursued, and came up to the prisoner, who was in a court in Homer-street; he saw me, ran away to some buildings, and was secured. I know him to be the man - he once worked for me.

GEORGE HAMBROOK
. I keep the Prince of Brunswick public-house at Islington. On the 4th of October, about three o'clock, the prisoner and two others came to my house—they had one pint of beer, which I took in—the prisoner went into the yard, and when he came in we missed a pot from the horse in the yard—I stopped him and another—I gave the prisoner to a person—he resisted very much—the other man then got away, and I went to assist in securing the prisoner—we got him on the ground, and discovered these two pots between his skin and his shirt—he had cut the bottoms off, and flattened them—he afterwards took the bottoms, I think, from under the waistband of his trowsers—I said, "You have been stealing my pots"—he said, If I have, I will pay you for them.




GUILTY
. * Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

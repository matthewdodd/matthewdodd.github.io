            . I am a paper maker
 at Hare-field


. My house was broke open the 19th of January. I have no family but a son-in-law, and myself. We went to work at six, or between six and seven in the morning. I fastened the door and left all safe. When I returned at about four o'clock, I found the casement open. I saw some old ragged cloaths on the floor, that I had observed on the prisoner, the night before: there was a red string I observed in his breeches, that hung down below his frock, when he was at my house the night before. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment; they were in the house when I went out in the morning.

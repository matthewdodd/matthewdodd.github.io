            . On the 4th of March, about half an hour after seven o'clock, I went out of the shop down below; when I came into the shop again, 
               
                  John 
                  Makin 
               



             came in and asked me if I had lost any thing; saying. he saw a man hand out two half Cheshire cheeses; I looked, and missed them; he described the man and his dress to me, with a red waistcoat, a woollen cap on, and a sort of jockey cap over it, with a dirty apron on; I described his dress to the watchman, and he took the prisoner up.

            . I was coming along Portland street, it wanted about a quarter of eight in the evening; I saw the prisoner standing at the prosecutor's door, and a boy was at the corner of the shop; the shop has two fronts, being at a corner. I saw the prisoner go into the shop and take out two half cheeses, and give them to the boy; I saw a boy standing at a little distance; I went and told him of it, and desired him to come with me to go after them, instead of that he went off another way; then I went to the shop, the prosecutor came up into it; I told him what I had seen; we went two different ways to see for them, but could not find them; the next day I saw the prisoner in Argyle-buildings; I had described him to the prosecutor, and he to the watchman, who took the prisoner up; I am sure the prisoner is the man.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.
He called two women, one had known him ten years, and the other eight, who said they never knew any ill by him.

GEORGE ETHERINGTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of February, 1 tea-pot, value 6s.; and 1 pair of bellows, value 1s. 3d.; the goods of 



Abraham Norden.






ABRAHAM NORDEN
. I am a broker, and live at Hammersmith. I have known the prisoner some time—he was backwards and forward in my shop on the 12th of February a good many times—after he was gone I missed a tea-pot—it was close to the front of the door, just entering in—this is it—(looking at it)—I do not know how the prisoner gets his living—he is a tailor by trade—these bellows are mine—(looking at them)—I lost them.





RICHARD COLLIS
. I live at Hammersmith, and am an appraiser. I have known the prisoner four or five years—I met him, on the 12th of February, at a few minutes after two o'clock, close* to Angel-lane, Hammersmith—he beckoned me, and asked if I could lend him a shilling, as he wanted it particularly—I said I had no objection to lend him a shilling if I had some security—he had this tea-pot in his hand, and I had it to hold till the next day—the next morning I heard he was taken, and I went to his residence, and found the officer there—I stated this, and gave up the tea-pot.





GEORGE LOW
 (police-constable T 50.) I took the prisoner from information—I told him what he was charged with—he denied having the tea-pot in his possession—another officer found these bellows the next day.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a person in the street selling these articles—I bought them of him a few yards from where the prosecutor lives—I had sold the bellows, but not the tea-pot.




GUILTY.* Aged 49.—


Transported for Seven Years.

HENRY HART
 was indicted

HENRY WHITKINS
. I am in the employ of Mr. John Richardby Bousfield and two others—they live in Houndsditch—on the afternoon of the 8th of Jan. I was out with a truck delivering parcels—I had a parcel directed to Mr. Morpeth, of Staines—about three o'clock I was in the Old Bailey, going to deliver a parcel at the New Inn—I saw a person get up in a stooping posture from the side of my truck—I received information, and saw the prisoner going along the Old Bailey—he turned down Fleet-lane, dropped this parcel from his person, and ran on—I pursued, till he was stopped by another person—I never lost sight of him for an instant—I kept him till I gave him to a policeman—Whittington brought me this parcel—it contains two coats, which belong to my employers.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. How far was the prisoner from Fleet-lane when you first saw him? A. About half way—I was ten or twelve yards from him—I did not lose sight of him—I turned the lane as quick as he did.





JOSEPH BARKER
. I saw the prisoner that day running down Fleet-lane—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw him drop this parcel—I took it up, and gave it to Whittington.





GEORGE WHITTINGTON
. I am a carrier. I was in the Old Bailey—I saw the prisoner take the parcel from the truck—I told the carman—the prisoner put the parcel under bis coat, and went towards Fleet-lane—the carman followed him—I received the parcel from Barker, and gave it to the carman.





JOHN HAWKINS
 (City police-constable No. 477.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted on 27th Feb., 6th Vict., and imprisoned six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

HENRY OSMOND.
I am a butcher, and live near Sturminster Newton, in Dorsetshire. I am in the habit of sending up meat for sale to Mr. Dowding, of Newgate-market—on the 7th of May I sent two hampers of meat up—one was lost—it contained five sides of veal, 2 pigs with

their heads on, and three calves' heads—I always place the cauls of the calves in the kidneys—I did so on that occasion—that is the usual course with butchers in our county—we always do it—the largest pig weighed ten stone four pounds, and the smallest seven stone four pounds—a cloth was wrapped round each side of veal, and a cloth round each pig—that would make seven cloths—I sent the hampers up by the Southampton railway—Dawes, the wagoner, contracts to bring them to London for me.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. Who did you deliver these things to? A. Mr. Crouch, a tradesman at Sloughton, three miles from me—he sends to London the same as I do—I left them in his care, and he sent them—I saw them go away from his yard in a caravan—one of his carters drove it—a great quantity of provisions comes from our county by the railroad—a great deal of meat is sent—I directed the hampers to Mr. Dowding—I had no mark on the veal or pigs—I could not have sworn to them myself if I had seen them in Newgate-market—there are a great many butchers in our part, and they all send the meat up in the same way—hundreds and thousands of sides of veal come up with the cauls in the kidneys—Mr. Dawes's name was on the cloths—I had no mark on them myself.

MR. CLARKSON.
Q. Have you ever been able to find them since? A. No—the hampers were Dawes's as well.





GEORGE MOGAN.
I am clerk to Mr. Dibdin, of Gerard's-hall, Basinghall-lane—he is agent to Dawes, the wagoner. On Saturday, the 9th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was attending the unloading of one of Dawes's wagons at Newgate-market—there were some hampers in it with directions on them, and one without a direction—I helped to throw that one out of the wagon on to the ground near Blake's stand—two of Mr. Robinson's men assisted me—in consequence of there being no direction on it, it was opened, to see if there was any note inside—I saw some sides of veal in it, I cannot say how many, two pigs, and three calves' heads—I know Austin—he was employed that morning in pitching from that wagon—I left the hamper at the side of Blake's stand, not knowing who it belonged to—I had some weigh-bills to make out, and another wagon was coming in.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIS.
Q. Does Dawes send a great many wagons to town? A. Three a week—some journeys more hampers come than at others—I have known as many as thirty or forty come at one time, and sometimes not above one—all the meat that comes is enclosed in cloths—a great number of Dawes's cloths come to town every week—I do not know what Hutton is—I believe he has been a porter.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN.
Q. Did you know Austin before? A. Yes—he worked at Gerard's-hall with us for some time.

MR. CLARKSON.
Q. Then he would know the course of your business? A. Yes—the meat was brought from the railway at Vauxhall in three wagons, on the 9th of May—there was no complaint of the loss of more than one hamper on that occasion—it was about twenty minutes past seven o'clock when I pitched the hamper—I fastened it down again after opening it.





JOHN WILLIAMS.
I am in the employ of Mr. Lamer, a meat salesman in Newgate-market. On Saturday morning, the 9th of May, about halfpast seven o'clock, I saw a hamper lying by Blake's stand—I know Hutton and Austin by sight—I saw them that morning—they had a truck

with them—I saw Hutton help Austin with the hamper off the street by Blake's stand on to the truck—Austin then drew the truck, and Hutton pushed behind—they went round the corner of Warwick-square, and I saw no more of them—I did not see any third man—I saw Austin about half an hour after—they went in a direction towards Simmonds's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. Was it not Austin that had the truck? A. Yes—Hutton helped him to put the hamper on—I did not hear them speak to each other—I was not near enough to hear them—I saw a knuckle of veal and the leg of a pig hanging out of the hamper—it was a knuckle of veal I saw.

Q. Recollect what you have said before—did you not see some knuckles of veal hanging out? A. I saw a knuckle of veal—well, I saw some knuckles of veal hanging out—I saw more than one, I cannot say how many—I will say two—I will not swear I did not see four—they were quite plain to be seen—not covered up—they were hanging out at the corner of the hamper—I could see no cloths at all—the hamper was tied down.

cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN.
Q. Was the business of the market going on? A. Most of the business was over—there were not many persons about—I saw no one near the truck but Austin and Hutton—other persons might have seen the truck as well as me—Austin had hold of the truck with both his hands—Hutton was walking along by the side—it stopped by the side of the pavement while they raised the hamper on one end, and put it on the truck—if Austin had given Hutton any directiorn I should not have heard it—I was within ten or fifteen yards of them—I saw no one between me and the truck—I saw a good many persons with trucks that morning.





JOSEPH WELLS.
I am in the employ of Mr. Simmonds, a meat salesman, in White Hart-street, Newgate-market, two or three hundred yards from Blake's stand. On Saturday morning, the 9th of May, about halfpast seven o'clock, or between that and eight o'clock, Hutton came to our place, and said there was a hamper of meat coming, and about five minutes after, he and Tack came with packs on their backs, not with a hamper—the meat was packed in cloths—they pitched it at the door—after all the meat was unpacked from the cloths, I looked over it—there were five sides of veal, two pigs with their heads on, and three calves' heads—Hutton came for the cloths some time after, and I gave him the seven cloths that the meat was packed in—he at first claimed six sides of veal, but there were but five—Tack was with him when he came for the cloths, and they went away together.

cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. Who did you give the cloths to? A. Hutton—I have been examined before—I am sure I gave them to Hutton—he and Tack were together—I do not think I ever said I gave them to Tack, but I cannot swear now which I gave them to—I never mentioned about the seven cloths before to-day.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROE.
Q. Was there more meat brought than one man could carry? A. There was, decidedly.





FREDERICK FIREMAN.
I am a butcher, and live in Raven-street, Mileend-road. I sell meat sometimes at Mr. Simmonds's stand. On Saturday morning, the 9th of May, about seven or eight o'clock, I saw all the three prisoners—all three of them had packs on their backs—I could not tell what it was—it was wrapped up in cloths—Hutton called out for Mr. Sim


monds—I asked who that was for—he said, "For Simmonds, " and asked where he should put it—I said, "Down against the door"—two of them (I am not able to say which) pitched their packs against the door, and one in the shop—I asked Hutton where it came from—he said, from a man named Smith, and that it came by Smith's wagon, from the Rose Inn, Smithfield—the other two were by at the time—I called Mr. Simmonds's attention to the mode in which the veal was dressed, the caul being stuffed in under the kidneys, which is not usual—there were five sides of veal, two pigs, and three calves' heads, which Tack brought in his hand.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. Was the teal all tied up in cloths? A. Yes—I could not see what it was till it was undone—I did not notice any thing hanging out—the pigs were packed up the same—no part of them was visible—I saw no part of the veal or pigs till they were unpacked, but I did not take particular notice.

Q. You first said the caul was stuffed in the kidneys, and then under? A. It is all the same—it was in the fat of the kidneys, which we call the kidney.





JOSEPH SIMMONDS.
I am a meat salesman, and live in White Hart-street, Newgate-market. On Saturday morning, the 9th of May, Austin came to my shop, about half-past seven o'clock—that was the first time I saw him—he brought some meat with him, packed in clothe—I was standing outside the shop when it was pitched on the pavement at the door—about ten minutes after, Austin came again, and asked me to pay the pitching of the meat—I asked him his demand—he said, "6d., I suppose"—I paid him, and he then went away—about half-past nine o'clock Hutton came, and inquired whether the meat was sold—I told him it was not all sold—he then went away—he came again about two o'clock, and Tack with him—he then bought a pig at 5d. a pound—it weighed 10 stone 7lbs., and came to 1l. 16s. 3d.—he did not pay for it but directed it to be taken off the money for the meat, and he would call for the balance on the Monday—the pig was entire, and Wells chopped it down for him—Hutton took his half away in his apron, and Tack had his half cut up in pieces.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. Who generally pays for the pitching? A. It is paid by the salesman, and deducted from the account of meat—the person that owns the meat is entitled to the pitching—it is different at different inns—at our place, it goes to the carrier or the innkeeper—I cannot say how much meat Austin brought—it was wrapped in cloths—it had the appearance of veal, but I did not open tat cloths—Hutton came to me afterwards, and said he came to be paid for the meat which was left there in the morning—he did not say which his master had left—I did not see Hutton come with the meat in the morning—I asked my father whether he knew Hutton—he said he bad known him about twenty years, and I then let him have the meat.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROE.
Q. Did Tack but this pig of you? A. No—he took away a side—a whole pig was divided into two—one side was cut into joints—Hutton carried that away, and Tack the other.





THOMAS HERDSFIELD.
I am an officer of the City of London. On the afternoon in question, a little before three o'clock, I saw Hutton and Tack in Newgate-market—they had a side of pork each, and, in consequence of suspicion, I stopped them.


Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. And charged them with stealing a hamper of meat? A. I did, and they denied it.





WILLIAM SALES.
I come from the Rose Inn, Smith field. A good many hampers came there on Saturday morning, the 7th of May, bat none from a person named Smith, by Smith's wagon.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. How many men are there to take in the meat at the Rose Inn? A. Six altogether, on a Saturday—I could not name all the persons that sent meat that Saturday—Smith is not a common name—I cannot swear that many persons named Smith send meat to the Rose Inn—the five other men received things that came by the wagon as well as me—three carriers came to my master's that day—I cannot tell the names of the persons who sent goods by them—there may have been a person named Smith who sent things by these carriers.

MR. CLARKSON.
Q. Did any wagon come up from Smith on Saturday the 9th of May at all? A. No—we had one come in on Friday the 8th.





BENJAMIN DOWLING.
I am in the habit of transacting business for Mr. Osmond, and sell his meat most weeks. On Saturday, the 9th of May, I expected two hampers of meat, and one flat of offal—I only received one hamper and one flat of offal—I have no memorandum with me of the contents of the hamper which I did not receive—I had received a letter, but I cannot find it—I have looked for it, but I suppose it is mislaid, if Mr. Humphreys has not got it—he asked me for it a few days ago, and I told him if he had not got it I had lost it—I am not certain whether or not I put it on my file—I looked there, but could not find it—I searched in my desk and everywhere—I was told in the letter that I was to receive five sides of veal, two pigs, and three calves' heads—that is what I expected to receive.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS.
Q. How do you remember that? A. By reading the letter—I dare say there were other things in it—he hoped I should make a good sale of his meat—I am in the habit of receiving a good deal of meat from Dorsetshire by the railroad, but I never saw any meat from that county dressed like Osmond dressed his—(looking at a letter)—this is a letter I received from Osmond, but not the one which I cannot find.





GEORGE MORGAN

re-examined. I helped to pitch several hampers off the wagon—it was the one without the direction that was taken to Blake's stand—Austin was employed at the wagon generally—he was not there at the time the hamper was thrown off.

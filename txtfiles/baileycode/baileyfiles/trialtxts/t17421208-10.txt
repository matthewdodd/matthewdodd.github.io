             . The 1st of December last, as I was talking to a Gentleman, the Prisoner past me twice: Said I, What do you want? I bid the Gentleman good Night, and walked on: He followed me still, and pick'd my Pocket: I felt the Handkerchief go: I pursued the Fellow, took him by the Collar, and said he had pick'd my Pocket. I took it from between his Legs. - He went away quietly; he did not make a Run at all. There were two other Handkerchiefs found upon him besides mine.
Prisoner. I never was guilty of any such Thing. If I see a Handkerchief upon the Ground, I think it is free for any Body.

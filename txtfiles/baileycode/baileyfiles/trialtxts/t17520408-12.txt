Goodson Vines. On the 5th of March, between twelve and one o'clock at noon, I was walking up Threadneedle-street


, I felt something at my pocket, and turned round, and saw the prisoner; I walked on and felt something again, then I looked back and saw him with his hand in his pocket, and a corner of my handkerchief hanging out; I took it out; it was in his left-hand waistcoat pocket; he said, he picked it up; I know I had it in my pocket but a little time before. (The handkerchief produced in court and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I was walking along the street, and picked up thief ; I had followed the prosecutor the Change ; he miss'd his handkerchief, and turned round directly and said, you have got my handkerchief; said I, I have got none but this which I picked up just now; then he took me to Guild-hall before a gentleman.

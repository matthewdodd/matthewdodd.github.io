             . On Wednesday the 4th of May , about one in the morning, I lost my watch at Mr. Watson's, a brandy-shop in Peter's-street, Soho. The Prisoner asked me to give her a dram; I told her I had no money, and she gave me one; I pulled out my watch to see what it was o'clock, and the Prisoner snatched it out of my hand and run away , and there were two persons who took it from her; I run after her, and found her in Compton-street.
[ The watch was produced, and the Prisoner said it was her watch .]

             . I was informed that the Prisoner had lost his watch, and I went to a house in Compton-street, where I was told the Prisoner was , and she was lying upon the floor in the publick brandy-shop ; I took hold of her arms, and I found something that I thought felt like a watch , and a person put his hand between her breast and her arm-pit , and I saw the watch taken from the Prisoner.
Mr. West. I am a constable, the Prisoner said before the Justice that the Prosecutor was her husband, and abused the Justice very much.

            . I am the son of Patrick Sullivan - he lives in Mary-le-bone


. On the morning of the 15th of October, about half-past seven o'clock, I hung this coat over a broken pane of glass in the window - my mother said it was gone; I got up, and missed it - I went out and saw the prisoner and another boy doubling it up; they were a few yards off - I cried Stop thief! and went up to them; they ran different ways - the prisoner was stopped without my losing sight of him; they dropped the coat - my mother picked it up.
Prisoner. The other boy dropped it. Witness. Both had hold of it - I cannot say which dropped it.

            . I saw the prisoner running - he was stopped, and said no one could prove that he had the coat, and we could only give him a night's lodging.
Prisoner's Defence. I ran; a boy came up and said, "I'll stop you, you young rascal;" I turned round and said, "Why do you call Stop thief! after me" - they then gave charge of me.

            . I live with Mess. More and Strange, cheesemongers

 in Bishopsgate street. On the 23d of May we lost a firkin of butter from Priddle and Mould's door in Newgate-street


. It was sent up there from the wharf, the net weight 56 pounds.

            . I was coming by Priddle and Mould's door, when I saw the prisoner take a firkin of butter up and carry it down St. Martin's-le-Grand. I thought he was no porter by his taking it up so aukwardly.

            . I pursued the prisoner and brought him back, and he and the butter were carried before my Lord-mayor, when he was committed.
Parker. I saw the butter before my Lord-mayor; it was the property of Mess. More and Strange.

Prisoner's Defence.
A gentleman-like man gave me 2 d. to carry it to the Faulcon and Castle inn.

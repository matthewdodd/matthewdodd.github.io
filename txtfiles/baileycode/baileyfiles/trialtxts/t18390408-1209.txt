I met the prisoner in Playhouse yard, and 1 followed him—when he got to Perry's door he stood half a minute, and dropped the boots—I crossed and met him, and asked what he had done with the bundle—he said, "What bundle?"—I said, "The one you had under your arm"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I went and found it in the passage—it was these boots.

Primer's Defence. The policeman stopped me, and asked what I had got—I said, "Nothing"—he said, "Go about your business;" and when I was going, he picked up the bundle and ran after me—he asked me where I got it, and I said I did not have it.

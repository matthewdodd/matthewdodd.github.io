JOHN HARMAN
 was again indicted

 for embezzlement.


MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






DAVID STROUD
. I am a hosier, and live in Tottenham-court-road. About the 16th of January I bought of the prisoner a dozen pairs of brace-swivels—I paid him for the brass ends, and a dozen garters, 14s. together—on the 26th of March 1 bought a dozen garters of him, and paid him 6s. 6s. for them—I am quite certain of that.





GEORGE BARTON NORMAN
, I am a trimming-seller, living in Crown-street, St. Giles. About the 21st of March I bought of the prisoner four dozen catgut loops—I paid him 5s. for them.

Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTONE. Q. Have you been in the habit of dealing with him? A. Yes, about eighteen months or two years.





SAMUEL RUDDICK
. I live in Anchor-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner was in my employ for twelve months—I paid him a guinea a week—it was part of his duty to take out manufactured goods, and receive the money on my account—he ought to account to me every night—on the 16th of January he accounted for eleven pairs of buckled garters, but not for 7s.—on the 26th, 5s. was paid—in March he brought me no money, but 7s.—from Mr. Gatwood—he did not account to me for 5s. from Mr. Norman.

Cross-examined. Q. Was he a daily labourer? A. He was paid a guinea a-week whenever he was there a whole week—I gave him no commission on the things which were sold—it was very seldom he had directions—he was to sell for ready money—he had no book, for he could not write—the prisoner had never sold articles of his own, to my knowledge.





SARAH RODDICK
. On the 26th of March I received 5s. from the prisoner—I did not receive 6s. 6d.




GUILTY
.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

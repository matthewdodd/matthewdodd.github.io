            . I am a lighterman, I was coming over London-bridge; before I got to St. Magnus's church I looked through the ballusters, on the 4th of May in the morning, I saw the prisoner upon a lighter; he was wringing a piece of a leaden spout off at Fresh-wharf hole


; he twisted it backwards and forwards, and at last dropped it down between the lighter and the wharf; I went and told Mr. Williams of it. The spout went over the wharf into the river; the tide was not low enough to take it away then; Mr. Williams secured the prisoner, and when the tide fell the lead (produced in court) was taken up; there is 24 pounds weight of it.
Q. Whereabouts is Fresh wharf?
Gladish. It is about the length of this court-room from London bridge.

            . I am clerk to 
               
                  Richard 
                  Latward 
               



             and Co. (mentioning the partners names) Fresh-wharf belongs to them; I saw nothing of the fact, but was ordered to go to the Mansion-house to prosecute for them.

                  Williams 
               



            . I am servant to the proprietors of the buildings, Mess. Latward and Co. Gladish informed me what he saw the prisoner do; I went and laid hold of the prisoner, and charged the constable with him. We found the lead afterwards on the campshire in Fresh-wharf hole, at about half ebb; it was part of the leaden pipe that carries the water from the top of the building to the ground, fastened to the building.
Prisoner's defence.
I was on board a lighter, she heel'd off at high water from the key; I made a snatch at this pipe with my hand to save myself, and it fell down in the Thames, I could not hold it in my hands. The gentleman came and charged the constable with me; had I not catched hold of that I had been overboard; I am just come home from Antigua.
Q. to Gladish. How did the prisoner do it, or was it as he has mentioned?
Gladish. He took it in his hand and wrung it round, (describing it by that of a man boring with an auger;) the lighter could not heel, she was made fast at both ends.

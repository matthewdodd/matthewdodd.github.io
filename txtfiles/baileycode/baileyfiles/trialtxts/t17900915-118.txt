I live in Gracechurch-street. I know Mr. Spode; he lives in Fore-street. On the 24th of July
 the prisoner came to my house, about eleven o'clock, and tendered me this note; I asked who he came from in Fore-street? he said, from Mr. Spode: I told him I had no full half pint tumblers; but I had small ones; he said, it was small ones were wanted, and that he was going to Leadenhall-street, and would call again presently; he came back again; I had them nearly ready; I made out a bill of parcels, and delivered them to him, and he went away: I never saw him before to my knowledge.

I lost the things in the indictment the 26th of November, between four and five in the afternoon; they were hanging up in my passage, in Fulwood's Rents, Holborn


; they were taken away between four and five; I did not see them taken; one shirt and a boy's shirt have been found; I was at the magistrates when the prisoners were examined; I did not know them before.

             sworn.
I am a constable; I produce two shirts, one of which I took off the little one's back, (Cook) the other was on the back of an accomplice, whose name is Burke.
(The shirt deposed to, which was taken from the back of Cook.)
I know nothing of Griffiths, but from the accomplice.
PRISONER COOK's DEFENCE.
I bought the shirt of a Jew for a shilling, because I was a poor boy.

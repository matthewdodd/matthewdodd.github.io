            . I am a pewterer

; the prisoner worked with me as a journeyman
 ever since I followed business, which I began in 1751; my brother Boucher is partner with me. I was told by my foreman 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hawkins 
               



             that the prisoner had sold some plates to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Phipps 
               



            . I went to him, he told me he had bought a dozen of plates of him, he produced one, and carried it before my Lord-Mayor. I charged the prisoner, and carried him before my Lord-Mayor; there the prisoner owned he had taken some plates. I am not certain the word dozen was there mentioned by him; he was committed; these plates are worth about sixteen shillings.
Prisoner. I cannot contradict any thing he has said.


                  Thomas 
                  Hawkins 
               



            . I am foreman to the prosecutor; I paid the prisoner on the 4th of January four shillings for what he had done that week, he then paid me two shillings and the apprentice six-pence. On the Monday following I was informed the prisoner was seen in Cheapside with 2 dozen of plates under his arm. On the Saturday night the prisoner came and told it in the shop, he had paid Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Phipps 
               



             all he owed; I knowing one shilling and six-pence would not be sufficient to pay what he owed him, went there, Mr. Phipps told me he had bought a dozen of plates of him the Saturday before. The prisoner was charged with it, and he said he had sold them.

                  Ludington 
               



            . I met the prisoner on Saturday the 4th of this instant; I imagined he had got a dozen of plates under his arm done in paper. I mentioned it on the Monday at our shop, so it came to be discovered.


                  Thomas 
                  Phipps 
               



            . The prisoner brought me these dozen of pewter-plates on the 4th of January, he owed me a little debt, and brought me these by way of payment; after that Mr. Cleeve's apprentice came to me and asked me after such, I produced them, and said who I bought them of; the prisoner was taken up and carried before my Lord-Mayor, and there he owned he sold them to me.
Q. to Cleeve. Are these your plates?
Cleeve. I am certain by my mark they are my Manufactory.
Q. Did you intrust the prisoner to sell them ?
Cleeve. No, I did not at that time.
Prisoner's defence.
I was fuddled, and intended to speak of them after I had taken them.



               Guilty

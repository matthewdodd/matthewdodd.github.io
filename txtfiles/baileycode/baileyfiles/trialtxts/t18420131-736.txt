MARY REGAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of January, 28 yards of printed cotton, value 14s., the goods of 



James Carter Pafford; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE WALTERS
. I am shopman to Mr. James Carter Pafford. On the 10th of January, about five o'clock, I placed a piece of printed cotton at the bottom of our counter—the prisoner came in to purchase an article, and when she had left I missed the cotton—this now produced is it.





THOMAS CALVER
. I am a pawnbroker. On the 11th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought this cotton—I had received a description of it the evening before, and I stopped her with it.

Prisoner's Defence. I went into the prosecutor's shop on Monday; there were several other persons there. I was going out for some supper about ten o'clock, and I picked up the print wrapped up in paper. I took it next morning to Mr. Wells, the pawnbroker. I should not have gone to pawn it twelve doors from the prosecutor's if I had stolen it.





GEORGE TOWNSEND
 (police-constable E 113.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

The Prosecutor employed the prisoner to help him in his master's stable, and whilst he was gone to dinner, left him in the stable, and when he returned, the prisoner was gone; the prisoner was taken in the Minories by one of the patrol, and in his pocket was found a duplicate for a neckcloth.

            , the pawnbroker, said the prisoner pawned a shirt, handkerchief, and neckcloth, for three shillings.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I changed a coat and waistcoat with a Jew, and bought two neckcloths and handkerchiefs; the runners said the prosecutor said, he would get double the value of his clothes.

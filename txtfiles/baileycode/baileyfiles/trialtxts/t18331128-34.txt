THOMAS BLIZARD. I am a shoe-maker
, and live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch


; between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning of the 9th of November, I was at my window at work; I saw a boy come up to my window, take a pair of shoes and run away with them - they were outside, but unless I put them out I should not sell them - I pursued the prisoner; the policeman took him - I lost sight of him, but I am sure he is the boy.

            . My father is a policeman; I was coming down Holywell-lane; I saw the prisoner take the shoes, cover them with his apron and run off with them; I ran after him and saw him caught.

The record of the conviction of 
               
                  George 
                  Taylor 
               



             read in in court; wherein it appeared, that he was tried and convicted last sessions for stealing a large quantity of goods (this feather-bed being part of the same, the property of 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Logan 
               



            ), and found guilty, and received sentence of transportation.
See No. 191. in last sessions paper.

            . I found my bed in Taylor's house, when I went with a search warrant: the prisoner is his wife's sister: she was in his house at the same time: this was about four days after they were taken away, which was on the 24th or 25th of January. When I found it, I could not take it away, because the constable was called away; and when I went for it three days after, I could not get in. At last, I found it at 
               
                  William 
                  Snowsell 
               



            's, a broker, in Catharine-wheel-alley.

            . I was the officer that went with the search-warrant to Taylor's house, for Logan's goods: I saw the bed there, which he said was his property: the justices sent for me, so that I had not an opportunity to take that away: we went and left that there. I went again about 3 days after, and another time after that, but could not get in. After that, the bed was found in Catharine-wheel-alley: the broker said he bought it of Mr. Taylor's sister, for 12 s.

            . I live in Catharine-wheel-alley. I agreed with the prisoner at the bar for the bed, and paid her 12 s. for it. Logan and the constable have seen it since. Logan swore to it, as his property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I sold it by order of Mr. Taylor and his wife, and I gave the money to his wife, my sister.
Q. to Prosecutor. Did the prisoner hear you claim that bed, as your property?
Prosecutor. She did, when I first went and found it: we locked the door when we were in, and she and Taylor's wife came in at the window, and went up and down the house with us.
For the Prisoner.

                  Taylor 
               



            . I am wife to 
               
                  George 
                  Taylor 
               



            . I was at home, when Logan came and executed the search-warrant, when he claimed his bed: my sister was not with me at that time; she never sold any thing but this bed. I made away with the rest of the goods, to maintain my husband.

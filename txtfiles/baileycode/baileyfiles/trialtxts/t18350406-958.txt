AUGUSTA MARIA BINGHAM
. I am single, and live in Baker-street, Portman-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone. I keep a male and, one female servant—the prisoner has been in my service two years—about the 12th of March, I suspected her, but said nothing to her—I had missed articles—on the 23rd of March, I called her up stairs about twelve o'clock and said, "Open your boxes, Ann, for I think you have got all my things"—she did not speak a word, but opened all her boxes, which were all locked—the keys laid on the table—all the articles stated in the indictment were in them—she cried, but did not say any thing—she unlocked her boxes before me—some of the articles were in two drawers in her room—I kept them in various placet—most of them in a large black imperial, which was locked with two strong locks, and that was broken open, which raised my suspicions—I have put them at a low value—I know it all to be mine.





DUNCAN MCLEAN
. I am a policeman. I was called into the prosecutrix's house on the 23rd March—she charged the prisoner with robbing her of these articles—I searched further, and in one box found a band and another brooch, and her mistress claimed the cap on her head.





JOHN ROBINSON
. I am a police-sergeant. On the 23rd of March, the prisoner was brought to the station-house, with the property—she said it was her mistress's.

Prisoner's Defence. I do not know how the things came into my box.
(Isaac Woolmer, a butler; Mary Woolmer, his wife; aud Robert Hall, a painter and glazier, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 23.—(Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutrix)—


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Justice Gaselee.

JOHN HARRIS
. I am a chemist, and live in Beech-street. About one o'clock, on the 2nd of October, I was standing at my door—I saw the prisoner following a gentleman—he had the tail of his coat in one hand, and took his handkerchief out with the other—I seized him, and called to the gentleman, but he did not hear me—he went away—I do not know who he was—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, let me go, I will never do it again."





SAMUEL COOMBS
 (City police-constable, No. 36.) I saw the prisoner struggling with Mr. Harris—I went to his assistance—he said the prisoner had stolen a silk handkerchief—I took him to the station—I have never been able to find the gentleman.


Prisoner. I did it through distress; I have no father or anybody to help me.





WILLIAM MADGIN
 (police-constable F139.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

Transported for Ten Years.

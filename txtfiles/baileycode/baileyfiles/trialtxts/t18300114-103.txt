JOSEPH STONE. I live in White-horse-yard. Drury-lane


. I have lodgers, but the prisoner was not one. On the 31st of December, he and another man knocked at my door and inquired for one of my lodgers of the name of Turner- I said he was at work; they said he was not - I said then I could not tell where he was; they went away, and I went in doors - in five or ten minutes. I heard some person go up to the garret; I went to listen, and presently I heard a person come down - I looked out at my door, and three parts down the yard I saw the prisoner with something on his shoulder; I followed him, and saw him with the trunk on his shoulder - I asked what he had got; he threw it down and ran away - I pursued, crying Stop thief! and the Police-officer took him - I am quite sure he is the person who was with the other, and knocked at my door; he was carrying the trunk - this is it; it contains the property stated.

            . I am a Police-constable; I took the prisoner, and have had the trunk ever since.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a young man with a blue coat and metal buttons; he asked me to carry a load for him; he knocked at this door, and inquired for Turner - the prosecutor said he was not at home; we then went away, and then returned - I stood at a distance from the house; he went and got the trunk, and gave it me to carry.

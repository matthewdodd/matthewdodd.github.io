GEORGE BLATHERMAN. I lost my watch on the 12th of August; I was coming home, when I was stopped by those two girls between eleven and twelve at night; they stopped me, and induced me to go home with them, with which I complied. I went with them to a house in George Row


; Miss Goodman I gave five shillings to instead of going with her; and she seemed to regret the pleasure. more than wishing for the money; and wanted me to engage to stop with her; but I told her I could not. With that Miss Goodman ran away with my watch; I could not follow them quite so quick as they went, but I gave an alarm in the house, and the landlord came up and abused me, saying it was impossible such a thing could have taken place in his house, and I was obliged to retire. I gave information to the officer, and he apprehended the girls in about two days.

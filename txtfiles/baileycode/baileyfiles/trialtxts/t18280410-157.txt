            . I am an officer. On the 26th of March I met Jacobs and Ferris opposite the hospital in Whitechapel; they came on to the prosecutor's shop, and Ferris took the cheese - Jacobs was about six yards from him at the time; I took Ferris with the cheese, and gave him to my brother officer - I then pursued, and took Jacobs.
Prisoner JACOBS. He never knew any harm of me. Witness. I have seen him with thieves in Whitechapel.

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Thomas Marshall and Sons. On the 26th of March I put six cheeses on the stall-board of the window, and about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I went into the parlour to put on my boots; the officer brought the prisoner and Ferris in with the cheese, which I knew to be my masters.

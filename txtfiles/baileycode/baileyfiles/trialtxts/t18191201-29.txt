            . On Friday morning last I was standing in the Old Bailey


 at the execution - the four men were just being cut down. A person came behind me, and asked if I had lost any thing? I said,
"Not that I know of." He said,
"A man has just picked your pocket." I felt, and missed my handkerchief. He said he could shew me the man, and immediately pointed the prisoner out to me. I seized him, and charged him with picking my pocket, he denied it; but at that moment I saw him open his coat, take the handkerchief from under it, and drop it down. We secured him, and gave him in charge.

            , JUN. My father is a tobacconist
, and lives at Shoreditch


. On the 24th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in the warehouse, which joins the shop, and saw somebody behind the counter; I went in and found the prisoner there, with his hand behind his coat. I asked him what he had taken? he answered, Nothing. I pulled his coat aside and found a 5 s. paper of halfpence concealed between his legs - there is a mark on the paper. My father gave him in charge.

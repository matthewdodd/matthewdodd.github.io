CHARLES WIGGIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of February, 1 boot, value 6s., the goods of 



Charles Ashman.






MARIA ASHMAN
. I am the wife of Charles Ashman, shoemaker, of Castle-street, Finsbury. On the 4th of February, about ten o'clock, in the morning, I went into my kitchen, leaving the shop for about five minutes—on returning, the prisoner was in the shop—he had taken one boot, and was in the act of taking the other—he laid it down when he saw me—he asked if I could tell him of a situation, on my asking him what he did there—I said I did not know of one—he went out—I missed a pair of boots—one of them laid on a table by the shop door—I went after him, and asked what he had done with the boot—he said he had not got it—I said he had—he pulled it out of his pocket and threw it at me—the iron heel struck me over the eye, and caused me to faint—it cut my forehead, which bled very much indeed—the doctor attended me above a fortnight with it—the prisoner ran away, and after I recovered myself I called my husband—I described the prisoner to the policeman, and he brought him to our house on the Friday following—I recognised him in a moment by his dress and features, and his eye being sore—I should know him twenty years hence, I noticed him so particularly—I have not a doubt of him.





WILLIAM BARNES FISHER
. I was coming up Castle-street and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's shop—Mrs. Ashman came out and asked him for the boot—he threw it at her, and cut her forehead very much—I am sure he is the person.

Prisoner. I know nothing about it.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

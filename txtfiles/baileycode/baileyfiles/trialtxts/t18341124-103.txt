JOHN HOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of November, 1 set of fire-irons, value 4s., the goods of 



James Portch.






JAMES PORTCH
. I am an ironmonger and general dealer, and live in George-street, Chelsea. On the 7th of November the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a sheet of writing-paper—I gave him the paper—

he laid a shilling down on the counter, and, not having change, I sent my daughter out for it—during her absence he took a set of fire-irons off a chest of drawers, and asked me the price—I said 5s.6d.—he put them down—my daughter returned with the shilling, and said it was bad—he gave her sixpence out of his pocket, which I had given him as part of his change—she went again to get change for the sixpence—the prisoner seemed anxious for her to return, and went out, but did not return—I missed the fire-irons in about twenty minutes—I gave information to the policeman, who brought him back to my door with them.





JOHN RUSHWORTH
. I am a policeman. On the 7th of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor informed me of this—I made inquiry where I should be able to meet the prisoner—I met him with the fire-irons in his hand about nine o'clock—I said, "Halloo, what have you there?"—he said, "A set of fire-irons—I will sell them you, if you like, for 7s."—I said, "Seven shillings!"—he said sooner than have words about it, I should have them for 5s.—I took him back to the prosecutor's shop—he said he was the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had exchanged his watch with a man at a public-house at Chelsea for 15s.; and the fire-irons.)





JAMES PORTCH
. I am sure he is the man—he was more than ten minutes in my shop.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Lord Chief Justice Denman.

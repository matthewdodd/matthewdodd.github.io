             . The Prisoner came home in the same fleet as I did; we went to drink together, and I carried him into my own room. After I had fetched a dram, I saw the two rings lying on the cupboard by the fire-place, and my wife chid me for laying the rings so careless . I opened the drawer and put them in, and he saw me. I carried him to the Half Moon, near Whitechapel, to give him a pot of beer; he drank, goes out of the house to my wife, and tells her I would murder her, for an excuse to go to the rings. He confessed the taking them.

            . After he and my husband were gone to the Half Moon, he came up and told me my husband was very angry with me, and would murder me; to which I gave but little heed; and in that time he had took out the drawer, and taken the two rings out. I was a washing, with my back towards him. When we took him, he confessed it to me and others, but denied it before the Justice.

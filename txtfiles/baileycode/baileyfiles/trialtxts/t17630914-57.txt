             were indicted for 


               breaking the dwelling-house of 
                     
                        
                           William 
                           Plowman 
                        




                      
                  , on the 25th of July
, about the hour of 1 in the night, and stealing one walnut-tree tea-chest, six silver tea-spoons, a copper tea-kettle, six china cups and saucers, a pewter spoon, three drinking glasses, a tea-pot, and a gallon of rum, the property of the said William, in his dwelling-house
            . *
The prosecutor had taken the Old Coach-makers-arms in Long-acre


, but had not become an inhabitant in it; he had brought a quantity of rum, and little more than the things mentioned in the indictment, on the 25th of July, he thought, but was not certain, whether he locked the sore door, he left it about 12 at night; the next morning at 7 he went, and found a watchman's lanthorn and staff, and part of a pot of beer; after some little time Black came in, and said he had been to get a dram, and said the lanthorn and staff were his; that he had found the door open, and a person unknown to him gave him charge to take care of the house. Soon after he missed the things mentioned in the indictment; after that he took Black, who said the other two prisoners were in the house with him; (the prisoners are all three watchmen) the prosecutor, in searching Nicholson's lodging, found two china cups and saucers, a pewter spoon, a tea-pot, and a drinking glass under a trap-door even with the floor, in an old tin kettle, his property.

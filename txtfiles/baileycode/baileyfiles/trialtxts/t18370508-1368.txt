HENRY SUMNER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
7th of April, 1 snuff-box, value U., the goods of 



Richard Lawrence; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN HILL
. I live with Richard Lawrence, a general dealer, in Charcroft's terrace, New Cut, Lambeth. On Friday, the 7th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, and inquired of my sister the price of a snuff-box, and while she turned to ask me the price, he must have put this snuff-box into his pocket—he said the one he asked the price of was too much, and put it down, and went away.





JAMES BROOKS
 (police-constable L 118.) On the afternoon of the 7th of April I was in company with Goff in the New Cut, and saw the prisoner—Goff said, "He has got something, and has put it into his pocket"—he ran off as hard as he could—I ran after him for half a mile, and when about six yards from him I saw him take this box from his pocket, and throw it into the road.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFF
 (police-constable L 31.) I was with Brooks, and saw the prisoner, in front of the prosecutor's shop, hand something to a young girl inside, and as she walked away into the shop He look something, and put it into his right-hand pocket—he followed her into the shop, and came out directly—I told Brooks he had got something—we followed, and at last secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM BROWN
 (police-constable L 9.) I know the prisoner. I was at Horsemonger-lane, in October last, when he was tried—I had apprehended him, and was a witness on his trial—I produce a certificate of his conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey (read)—he is the person who was convicted.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

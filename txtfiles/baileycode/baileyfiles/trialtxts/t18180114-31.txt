            . I am a warehouseman. I was going along Cheapside, about half-past five o'clock on the 9th of December, and saw the prisoner rush from the pavement with such great violence, that he ran against a cart, and knocked himself down. I went towards him to help him up; before I got to him he was up, and looking for his hat, which had fallen off. I told him it was under the horses' feet - He got under their bellies; I saw a bundle in his hand, part of it dragged on the ground. I told him he was a thief, and run round the horses to take him; he run off, and left his hat behind, which I picked up, and pursued him, calling "Stop thief!" When I got to Milk-street, he threw the bundle down - I picked it up, it was a piece of print. He was taken in Milk-street.

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of December I heard the alarm, and run towards Milk-street. Mr. Midwood had the prisoner in custody, with the goods.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I beg for mercy.

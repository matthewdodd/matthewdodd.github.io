            . I am a salesman
, in Goswell-street


; on the 26th of May I lost a gown; it hung at the door; I had hung it up about two hours before I missed it. I wrote a number of bills, and carried to all the pawnbrokers about; in consequence of which I found the gown at one Mrs. Rutland's in Old-street. (The gown produced by Mrs. Rutland, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . The prisoner brought this gown to our house to pawn; he said it was for his mother, she has dealt with us many years; I lent him 7 s. upon it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I live at a barber's shop in Lombard-street; my mistress sent me of an errand to Islington; I called and took my sister with me; as we came back she picked up this gown before Mr. Brown's door, an oil shop. two or three doors from the prosecutor's house.
For the Prisoner.

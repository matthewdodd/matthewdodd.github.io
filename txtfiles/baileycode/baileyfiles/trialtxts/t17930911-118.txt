             had been my servant
 thirteen months previous to her being taken up. I have a great number of shoes, I did not miss any of them, they appear to be taken at different times.
Q. Have you any shoes here? - Yes, I have; she confessed.
Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - When she had confessed she had taken some shoes, I said if she would confess the whole I would be as favourable as ever I could; before I made that promise she only confessed generally.
Mr. Knapp. At the time you charged her did not you hold out these hopes to her? - By no means.
Q. Did you not either one way or the other? - It was taken down before the magistrate.
Q. You seem to be an extream fair man, you have lost a deal of property; was it not when you charged the woman, that you said, well if you have robbed me for some time and will make a full confession I will shew you favour? - Certainly not, because I had information before I charged her.

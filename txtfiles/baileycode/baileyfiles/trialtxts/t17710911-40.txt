                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



            . I live servant with Mrs. 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Hamilton
               



            ; she keeps a house in Westminster


. On the 15th of July I had been up in my room, between three and four in the afternoon; as I came down I heard a knock at the door; I found 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



            ; she said she saw a person walk a-long the leads, from the garret window, with a couple of bags of cloaths. I immediately went up into the garret, and found the door locked on the inside; I left it open a few minutes before; I had only just come down stairs; I went down again to hear if I could hear any thing of the person; I saw 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



             standing by the prisoner, he was in custody. I saw the things in the bag, they were mine; he was carried before justice Keeling.
Q. How was the garret window secured?
Isaacs. By four bars, two in the casement and two in the other part.
Q. When you returned back, how did you get into the garret?
Isaacs. When I came to the door, my fellow servant had just pushed the door open.
Q. Had she been in the garret before you came in.
Isaacs. No; she had just pushed it open, and we went in together; I found the two bars of the window standing on the floor beside the window, one of them was bent very much.
Q. Did you find any other bars?
Isaacs. Yes; there were two other bars.
Q. Was they belonging to you, or brought there?
Isaacs. Brought there; they were not in the room before; (these are them; producing two large iron bars.) the prisoner was searched before the justice, and two of my handkerchiefs found on him; I had seen them a few minutes before, in the trunk in the garret.
Q. from the prisoner. Did you ever see me?
Isaacs. I saw you when you was brought to the door, and at the justice's.


                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



            . I live servant with 'squire Francis; our house is opposite Hamilton's; I was standing at the door, and saw the prisoner go along the leads of Mrs. Hamilton's house. I took particular notice of his dress; he had a blue coat, and, I think, a black waistcoat and breeches. He was going along the leads, with two large bags of clothes. I went to the corner, and saw him get into the empty house, which was next door; I did not see him come out of the house; I only saw him on the leads. I met 
               
                  Sarah
                   Bates
               



             coming round the corner; I told her what I had seen; she desired me to inform Mrs. Hamilton's family of it. I went and told Isaacs of it; the man was standing at the empty house door; when I told 
               
                  Sarah
                   Isaacs
               



            , she shut the street door and ran up stairs; I crossed the way, and told 
               
                  Sarah
                   Bates
               



             that was the man; she said let us watch him; we went about two yards from the corner and turned back immediately; and he was running down the street, with the two bags across his shoulders; we cried out, stop thief; and he throwed them down immediately; he ran down the street, and I ran after him.
Q. Was he in your sight all the time.
Dalon. Yes; I pursued him; the other young woman staid by the clothes. He was stopped by 
               
                  James
                   Lacey
               



            , and was carried before justice Keeling.


                  Sarah
                   Bates
               



            . On the 15th of July I went to see 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



            ; we were opposite Mrs. Hamilton's house; she said she saw a man on the leads of Mrs. Hamilton's house, and that he went into the garret window. 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



             went to acquaint 
               
                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



             what she had seen. I crossed over the way, and stood in the middle of the causeway, while she was telling 
               
                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



             what she saw. I saw the prisoner standing at the door of the empty house.
Q. Do you recollect how he was dressed?
Bates. In a blue coat, a black waistcoat and breeches. 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



             parted with 
               
                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



            . 
               
                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



             went up stairs. 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



             and I crossed the way. I saw the prisoner go into the passage of the empty house; in about three minutes I turned back and saw him come out of the house, with two bags over his shoulder; I cried out, stop thief; he immediately dropped the bags; I ran and picked them up; 
               
                  Bridget
                   Dalon
               



             pursued the prisoner. I stood by the clothes till he was taken.


                  James
                   Lacy
               



            . On the 15th of July, about four in the afternoon, I heard a cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner running; I pursued him, and another person and I took him, and carried him to justice Keeling's: he throwed down two handkerchiefs, and said for God's sake let me go about my business, that is all I have got. 
               
                  William
                   Truebridge
               



             searched the prisoner before the justice, and found these two handkerchiefs in his pocket. (producing them.)


                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



            . These are my handkerchiefs; I made them out of some Manchester cotton that I had by me; it is not common stuff to make handkerchiefs of. (the bags produced.)


                  William
                   Truebridge
               



            . These bags were opened before the justice and delivered to 
               
                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



            .


                  Mary
                   Isaacs
               



            . They are in the same condition as they were then; They are all my property excepting three shifts, a handkerchief, and two caps. I had seen them in the garret not above five minutes before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been drinking all that day and was in liquor; when I was running home I was stopped and charged with this robbery. I had not left my friend half an hour that I had been drinking with. I never saw these things before, nor ever had the handkerchiefs in my pocket.
"He called

                   Hatton
               



            , who both gave him a good character."

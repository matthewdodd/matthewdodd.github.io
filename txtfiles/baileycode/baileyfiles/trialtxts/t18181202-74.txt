            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in James-street, Manchester-square


. I went out, when I returned home these things were missing out of my back kitchen. The prisoner lodged two years with me, and was moving that day. I had her apprehended on suspicion of the robbery, and went to the lodging she had taken in Nowel's-court, and found my property in a box which I had seen her carry out that day. I found all these things, except a coat, which was pledged in Oxford-street. As she was going to the watch-house she dropped twenty-seven duplicates, some of which related to the property.

            . I am the prosecutor's apprentice. I missed my things, and the other apprentice missed his hat. As the prisoner was going to the watch-house I saw her drop the duplicates. I asked her what she had done with my coat? she said she had pledged it at Dobree's - I found it there. The duplicate was with the rest.

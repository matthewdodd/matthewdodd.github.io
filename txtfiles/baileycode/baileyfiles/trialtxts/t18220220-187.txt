            . Last Sunday fortnight, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Charles-street, Covent-Garden


, going towards the Strand, and just as I got opposite the public-house, where there is a coach stand, the prisoner came towards me, and snatched my watch all at once. I pursued him, and by Vinegar-yard, at the corner of Drury-lane Theatre - he was stopped by Gregory. I had not lost sight of him, and I am sure is the man.

            . I was in Bridges-street. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running towards me. I secured him at the corner of Vinegar-yard - he had his hand in his breeches pocket. I put my hand in, and drew out the watch. I took him to the watch-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

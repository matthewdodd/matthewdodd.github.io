            . I was sent out with a load of goods from Mr. Thomas Brown's warehouse, on the 24th of December - he is a cheesemonger
. I left the cart while I went into a house in the Hampstead-road


, with two sides of bacon and two tubs of butter - I was not absent above a minute and a half, and while I was in the shop I saw the prisoner take something from the cart; I ran out, and saw him with the cheese; I said "Drop it;" he dropped it, and ran - I ran and took him: this is the cheese - it was going to a person named Oliver, whose name is on it.
Prisoner's Defence. There was a man standing singing, and the cart was close by - I heard some one call out"Drop it," and I saw a man drop something; I went and saw it was this cheese - the witness then came and caught me.

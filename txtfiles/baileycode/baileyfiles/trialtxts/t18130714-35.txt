. On the 5th of July the two prisoner's came together to my shop, they asked to look at some sprigged muslin; my wife served them.
Q. Were you by at the time - A. No, I was not; nothing was missed until after the prisoners went out; in about two minutes after they were gone a shawl was said to be missing, that was on a stool in the shop. I had seen it not ten minutes before the prisoners came in. I followed the prisoners, and asked them to walk back with me; they came back; I charged them with having taken a shawl, and as soon as they came into the shop

             dropped a bundle from under her shawl, as soon as she entered the shop. I picked up the bundle and gave her in charge of a constable. The shawl was in that bundle; it lay on the top of every thing else. The stool was by the other counter, not the counter where my wife was serving. Nothing was found on the other prisoner. The shawl is worth four shillings.

, 22, Lower Holborn



. On the 5th of July, the two prisoners came into my shop together; one of them asked to look at some lace; my lad attended them. I did not missthe lace until Read, from Hatton Garden office, brought the lace. I saw both of them look at the lace; they were close to each other; they were in the shop about ten minutes; they bought nothing. It was between six and seven when Read brought the lace; I knewit tomine by the marks; I know I never sold it, and I am quite certain the prisoners bought nothing at my shop; I never saw them before. The lace has never been in wear; it is worth four shillings and three-pence. I am certain it is my lace; there are figures on it the hand writing of my servant.

            . I was sent for to take charge of this woman and the bundle; directly I untied the bundle the lace was on the top; I asked them how they came by the bundle; Brown said in the hearing of Deering, it was given to them.
Q. What did the bundle contain - A. A piece of muslin, and articles of haberdashery; they were not articles that had ever been in wear.
Brown's Defence. The bundle was given to me by a person that ran away from me. The person at the bar is innocent of every thing as a child unborn.
Deering's Defence. I know nothing at all about it; I am innocent.

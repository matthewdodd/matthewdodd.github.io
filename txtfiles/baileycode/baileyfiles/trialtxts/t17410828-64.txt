            . On monday the 27th of July the Prisoner brought this saddle to me, and desir'd to know the value of it. I look'd at it, and ask'd him how he came by it, and he said he had it from a groom at Hounslow who was ill and wanted to dispose of it. I told him it belong'd to Mr. Patfull, and I would stop it till he brought the person that own'd it. He went away, and in an hour's time came again with a note without any name to it, desiring me to return the saddle to the bearer, if I did not think proper to buy it. Upon this I sent for Mr. Patfull, and before he came, the Prisoner own'd he took it out of the stable at ten o'clock at night.
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the court. I never was concern'd in any fact before. 


               Guilty 10 d.

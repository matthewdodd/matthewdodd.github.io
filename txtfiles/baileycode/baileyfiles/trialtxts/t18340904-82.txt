            . I am the daughter of William Palfrey, of Flemming-street, Kingsland-road - on the 29th of July, I was walking in Kingsland-road


 with my little sister Emma - she had two rows of coral beads round her neck - a girl told me they were gone, and I missed them - I told the policeman of it, and a young man brought them to me- these are them.

            . I was standing at my door, and saw Palfrey leading her sister - I saw the prisoner go behind, and take the necklace from the child's neck - he gave them to one less than himself, and they ran off, down White Bear-gardens - I gave notice, and the beads were brought back - the prisoner was secured.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had gone to the spot on seeing a crowd, and was accused of the theft, of which he was innocent.)

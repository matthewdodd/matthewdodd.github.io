THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS UPON THE

Continuation of the Trial of 
               
                  James
                   Moore
               



            , &c.
What was your intention in going? - We went to get some money, about half past eleven o'clock; 
               
                  Bill
                   Haywood
               



             and I saw nothing in the cabbin, we confined the people on the deck, and Mackannally, and Farren, and Knight, went down into the cabbin; I believe they might be about twenty minutes, as nigh as I can guess, I saw a couple of coats and two pounds of tea, I did not see these buckles, we were to divide the property the next day; but the firing at the Captain gave me great uneasiness, because the young man that was with me fired at the Captain directly, I never heard Mackannally mention any thing about having any buckles.
Court to Christopher. Where were the buckles? - In my chest in the cabbin, the key was in the chest.
How did you know it had been opened? - Only by the loss of my buckles and coat.
MACKANNALLY's DEFENCE.
I never was on board the ship, I never saw the evidence before, I bought the buckles coming over London Bridge, a man met me, and I had him a guinea and gave him eighteen shillings.
Court to Jury. With respect to the other four there is no evidence but that of the accomplice, but as to Mackannally there is evidence against him exclusive of the accomplice sufficient to put him on his trial, for the buckles which Christopher has sworn to, were found upon him the next day, therefore, it is incumbent upon him to give some account how he came by these buckles.
Jury to Manning. Who fired? - There were three that fired in all, as soon as ever the Captain came up, 
               
                  Bill
                   Haywood
               



             fired at the Captain, and soon after Farren came up, and he fired, and Mackannally fired.
Prisoner's Council to Manning. How often have you been evidence for the Crown? - Never before.
No? - I do not know what you mean.
Did you ever impeach your accomplices? - In any bad ways.
You understand me? - I never was in a Court of Gentlemen before in my life.
Prisoner Mackannally. My Lord, he has been evidence twice before.
Jury to the Captain. Did you make any observation of the people that fired at you? - I was asleep when the men came into the cabbin, they demanded a candle, and to over-haul and search for goods, they pretended to be Custom House Officers; then they opened the chest and took out the tea and cloaths, I got hold of two of them but they were too powerful, then they fired at me, and one shot me under my arm, I cannot say which it was.

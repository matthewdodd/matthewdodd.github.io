JOSEPH SANDELL. I am silk dyer
; William Green is my partner
: I live at No. 15, in the Old Change


. The articles lost were in the house about the 1st or the 2nd of June, to the best of my recollection, I know nothing of the circumstance; only, in searching a drawer in the ware-room, up one pair of stairs, in a glove in that drawer, I found some duplicates; I immediately went to the pawnbrokers, and examined them; I there found two silk shawls with the mark of the shop upon them; I likewise found two silk handkerchiefs, and nine yards of sarsenet, property that we had in our house to dye. The pawnbroker found the next day eight breadths of sarsenet; they have each our private mark upon them. The prisoner was our journeyman. All the servants had access to that drawer.

            . I am a journeyman pawnbroker; I live at 66, Long Acre. Mr. Sandell came to our house; he produced the duplicates. The prisoner pawned the articles with me, on the 3rd, 8th, 10th, and 11th. I produce the articles.
Prosecutor. They are all my property.
Prisoner's Defence. I pawned them for fear of loseing them; I intended to replace them.

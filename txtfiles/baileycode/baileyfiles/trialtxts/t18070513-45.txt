            . I am a watchman of Marybone parish. On the 14th of April, when the serjeant of the night came to me in the division I belong to, he told me to beware of the thieves that night, they were out. I was ordered by the serjeant of the night to leave my lanthorn in the box; I went my rounds as regular as if I were to call the hours. At the hour of one o'clock I was talking to No. 49 watchman, that stands in New Cavendish-street; I left him and turned into Harley-street, Cavendish-square; I come down a good bit of Harley-street, and took Queen-Ann-street, West; hearing the noise of the people coming from Cavendish-street up Harley-street I stopped; I saw three men come across Queen-Ann-street, West; I kneeled down quite close to the railing, the night being dark; and took notice of three persons standing in the street; they stopped on the foot way on the same side with me; I saw them plainly, two of them turned into the door way, and one stood with his back to the house on the pavement, the tall man stood on the pavement, he said to the other men, d - n your eyes, you will not have such success to night as you had last night; they had gained a great quantity of lead from the off side of the street the night before. I took of my shoes and went up on my knees and hands, close to the ground where they stood, as close as I could without their seeing of me; I turned into New Cavendish-street, out of Harley-street, and then I stood upright.
Q. Then the men were in Harley-street were they. - A. I went to No. 49, watchman, and told him that the lead merchants were in Harley-street


, and I told him to come to my assistance; he came with me, and we both looked round the corner of New Cavendish-street, into Harley-street: then there was one man standing up at No. 19, on the railing turning into the door way; the other was standing at No. 21, on the top of the railing; Guppy was one, and the man that made his escape was the other; he stood at No. 21; Hobbs, the tall man, he was standing on the foot way, between the doors of No. 19 and 21. Accordingly Hobbs seeing us, he gave a double small cough, which was a signal to the two men; the two men threw themselves down off the railing at the time Hobbs coughed; they crossed Harley-street; and went on the darkest side; they went into Great Mary-bone-street; they all three walked very gently till they came to the end of Great Mary-bone-street, my fellow watchman darted after them; I catched hold of Hobbs, he ran a few yards before I laid a hand upon him; the two other darted up Great Mary-bone-street; No. 49, watchman followed them, and sprang his rattle; I secured Hobbs, he was getting very resolute to get out of my hands; I sprang my rattle for assistance, the serjeant of the night came to my assistance; and then he came quietly to the watchhouse. My partner took the other man.
Q. From the first time of your seeing them till the time you took them, how long was it. - A. About five or six minutes.

            . You are the watchman, No. 49. - A. Yes.
Q. On the 14th of April last, do you remember the alarm being given of thieves being about. - A. Yes,

            , the serjeant of the night, came round; he says, I have seen the captain in High-street.
Q. You were put upon the alarm by the serjeant of the night. - A. Yes, he told us the thieves were out; my partner came to me in New Cavendish-street, and told me they were at work in Harley-street.
Q. What time of the night was it. - A. Between one and two o'clock, it was very dark; in consequence of that, I went with him directly.
Q. Did you take your lanthorn with you. - A. No, I went into Harley-street, and both of us stooped down; I saw one upon No. 19, he was lifting the lead off, and the other upon No. 21; the third man stood with his back towards the door of No. 20.
Q. Do you know which man that was. - A. That was Hobbs, he was the tallest of the three; the other two were standing on the rails, taking the lead off the pediment of the door. One of the three men saw us, he made a cough, who it was I cannot tell. Upon this coughing, they immediately jumped off the railing, they crossed Harley-street, and went down towards Mary-bone-street; I and the other watchman walked after them; Henwright took hold of Hobbs; I saw him seize the tall man.
Q. Are you sure that he is one of the three men that you saw together. - A. Yes.
Q. How long did you lose sight of them when they turned the corner. - A. We were as close to them as six or seven yards; we did not lose sight of them at all.
Q. When Henwright seized Hobbs, what became of the other two. - A. The two started, I followed them both, and sprang my rattle; one took to the right and the other to the left; I followed to the left, down Welbeck-street, into Mary-bone-lane; there I seized Guppy; I brought him to the watchhouse; going along I saw Hobbs in custody of the other watchman, and the serjeant of the night.
Hobbs (to witness). Did you see me stand on the pavement. - A. Yes, it is a fact.
Court. When you saw him in custody of Henwright, did you or did you not know him to be the man that stood on the pavement. - A. Certainly, he never went out of my sight till Henwright seized him.
Q. I understand you to swear that you followed Hobbs, Guppy, and the other man, till they turned into Mary-bone-street, and you hardly lost sight of them for a moment. - A. Yes.
Q. (to Henwright) Are you perfectly clear that the prisoner Hobbs, is the same man that you saw standing with his back to No. 20. - A. The very same man; I never lost sight of him from the time I saw him, till I laid my hand upon him; he was beginning to start when we came upon him.

                  HART
               



            . I am serjeant of the night. On the 14th of April, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw the man they call captain, that is Hobbs, in High-street, Mary-bone, I knew him very well; he was coming out of a public house. I went round my division, and acquainted them that the captain was out.
Q. You did not see any body with him at that time. - A. No; the night before we lost upwards of fifty pounds worth of lead, out of Harley-street. I came to Henwright's assistance; when he sprang the rattle, he had hold of Hobbs.
Q. Did Hobbs appear to make any resistance. - A. He did; and I told him that if he did make any resistance and was not peaceable, I would blow his brains out with the blunderbuss. Then Henwright took him to the watchhouse.
Q. I suppose in your way you met M'Killock with the other man. - A. Yes; after we had secured the prisoners we went back to look at the houses, to see if there was any lead lost; I looked at No. 21 and 19, the lead was torn off, and ripped from the boarding of the pediment over the door, ready to take away; a few minutes more they would have took it completely away; both the places were in the same situation.
Hobbs. I never was on the premises, I made no resistance.
Hart. He did make resistance, he would have got away from Henwright if I had not come up. When we took him to the watchhouse, the constable of the night knew him; he asked him how long had he been out of prison, he said on Friday last.
MR. SPARKS. Q You live at No. 21, Harley-street. - A. I do.
Q. Do you know who lives at No. 19. - A. Mr.

            ; he has lived there five or six years.
Hobb's Defence. I am a seaman; I have been eleven or twelve years in his Majesty's service. I was discharged the last peace; I work at rigging. I had been to the West India dock. As I was going home down Marybone-street I met this watchman, they took me in charge and took me to the watchhouse. I never made any resistance.
Guppy's Defence. I was coming home from my sister; it was about half past one o'clock when I came from Holborn to Marybone; I was not nigh no man. The watchman sat the dog upon me, and by the dog following of me I ran to make haste home to my lodgings; the man took hold of me in Mary-bone-lane, he said I want you, you must come to the watchhouse. The other watchman, when we came up to him, said I was along with this man; I said I was not, no more I was not.

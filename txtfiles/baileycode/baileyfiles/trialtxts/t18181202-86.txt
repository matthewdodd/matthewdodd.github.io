            . I am a rope maker
, and live in Fenchurch-street; my manufactory is in Globe-lane, Mile End


. On the 25th of November, I was fetched to the watch-house, and found the hemp and the prisoner there. He had worked for me, but not at that time.
BENJAMIN HARRIS. I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner about five o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Crispin-street, with the bundle. I asked him what it was. He said it was clothes, which he was going to take to the Bell Inn, Holborn. I found it was hemp, and took him to the watch-house.

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. He said he met a man named Bryant, near Stepney church, who gave him the hemp to spin. I locked him up. He then took about ten skeins from under his clothes, and said his father worked for Mr. Tull, in Globe-lane. I sent Harris to Mr. Tull, who claimed it.

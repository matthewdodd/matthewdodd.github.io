, and live in High-street, Marylebone


. On the 8th of February, about halfpast eight o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me to give her something - I saw her draw a lump of butter from behind her, under the window, and put it under her shawl; I went forward - she went out; I said,"You have something belonging to me," and took it from her - she pushed me back into the shop, and ran away, but was secured, and this butter and cheese found on her.

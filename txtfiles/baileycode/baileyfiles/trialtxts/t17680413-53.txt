            . I am coachman to Colonel
 Clinton; the prisoner being out of place, I got him to help me in the stable; he and the things mentioned in the indictment were missing out of the stable on the 21st of January; he was taken for such another offence when I was gone with the carriage into the country; when I returned I took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he made several attempts to get away; when he found he could not, he confessed he had sold the things to Mr. Newton, a salesman; we went there, and found some of them; after that the prisoner escaped from us, but we took him soon after at his mother's, in a cupboard.

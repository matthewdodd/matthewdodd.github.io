2115. 




CORNELIUS DRISCOLL
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of July, 1 waistcoat, value 4s., the goods of 




Joseph Robert Minton.






JAMES DARLING. I
 am in the employ of Joseph Robert Minton, a tailor, in Ratcliffe-highway. I missed a waistcoat from our door on the 5th of August—it was outside the window—this is it.





WILLIAM WILSHIRE
. I found a duplicate of this waistcoat on the prisoner.






LAURENCE KENNEDY
. I am a pawnbroker and live at Shadwell. I produce this waistcoat, it was pawned by a man strongly resembling the prisoner—I cannot swear to the prisoner—he gave his name Driscoll—he was a coal-whipper, the same as the prisoner, and his face was all black.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

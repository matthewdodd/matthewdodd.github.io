WILLIAM ROCKHILL. I am a bricklayer
; and live in White Lion-street, St. Giles's. On the 7th of June, about 12 o'clock at night, I returned from the pay-table; I found I was locked out. I met the prisoner in Broad-street; she asked me to go with her. I went to No. 4, Charles-street


 with her; I awoke between three and four o'clock, I missed her and my money, which amounted to 1l. 8s. 6d.

ELIZABETH WALTERS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of November, 1 pair of shoes, value 2s., the goods of 



Charles Williams; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH WOOD WILLIAMS
. I am the wife of Charles Williams, who is a pawnbroker at Greenwich. Treadaway brought a pair of shoes to me—I saw they were ours—they had never been sold—the prisoner came to the shop after the shoes had been brought, and she had been before to take some patchwork out of pawn—the shoes hung on a horse, near the boxes—I had them in my hand the last thing at night—these are them—I am certain they are mine—I missed them immediately Treadaway spoke about them on 25th of November—we put some more on the horse and went into the back parlour, and while sitting there, the prisoner came in and rushed by the horse and came to pawn something for fourpence, and immediately we missed another pair.

Prisoner. Mr. Williams said if I paid 16s. he would let me off. Witness. He did not.





JONATHAN TREADAWAY
. I am shopman to Mr. Thompson in London-street. The prisoner offered these shoes in pawn on the 25th of November, about half-past four o'clock in the evening—seeing a mark on them we suspected they were stolen, and took them to the prosecutor—the prisoner ran out of the shop, and said she would send her sister.





RICHARD BURKETT
. I took her into custody.





GEORGE HARRIS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was a witness on the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

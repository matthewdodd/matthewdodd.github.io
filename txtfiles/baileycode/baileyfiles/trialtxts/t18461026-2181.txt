I was walking along Tooley-street—I felt a pull at my coat pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner close behind me, busily engaged in fastening up his jacket in front—he ran off, down a court—I followed him, and when I got down the constable had him—I found

my handkerchief was gone—I told the constable, and he took my handker-chief from the breast of the prisoner's jacket—this is it.

JOHN FREAKE. I am a shoemaker
. On the 13th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I stopped to hear a song, at the corner of Somerset-street, Whitechapel


. In three or four minutes I felt some person at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner, Thomason, with my pocket in his hand - He had cut it off. He gave it to the prisoner, Collins, who went immediately on the other side of the crowd. I collared Thomason, and called out Stop thief!-Collins ran away. I kept hold of Thomason. I had 2s. 3d. in copper money in my pocket. Collins ran about two hundred yards and was secured.
THOMAS RODGERS. I am a waiter. As I was coming by the end of Somerset-street, the prosecutor turned round, collared Thomason, and called out, Stop thief! Collins ran by me. When I got close to him he put his hand in his coat-pocket, and threw the halfpence from him. I secured him.
CHARLES ANGAS. I was coming out of my house in Whitechapel, about half-past seven o'clock of the 13th of December, heard the alarm, and saw Collins running. When I got to Castle-street he was stopped. A great many halfpence were picked up just by him.
THOMASON'S Defence. I deny it. He wanted me to give him 2s.
COLLINS'S Defence. I was hearing the song. I did not move.

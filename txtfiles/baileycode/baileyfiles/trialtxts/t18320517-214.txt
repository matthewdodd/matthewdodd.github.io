             (Police-constable S 22). On the night of the 7th of May I stopped the prisoner in Skinner-street, with this bottle under his coat; he appeared partly intoxicated - I asked where he got it - he said he bought it of a boy for 4d., at the corner of Brill-row.
CHARLES TEMPLE. I keep the Somers'-town coffee-house, in Charlton-street




. I have lost two or three sample-bottles of spirits - this is one of mine, and had rum in it; it has the mark of the ship on it: it was safe on the Friday, when we cleaned the window.
Prisoner. He could not swear to it at the office. Witness. My young man could not swear to it, but when I went I could - he was taken nearly a quarter of a mile from my house.
JURY. Q. Are you satisfied that no other publican has such a private mark as you have? A. It is not my mark, it is the ship's mark, and my number, which is 63; the numbers go regularly.

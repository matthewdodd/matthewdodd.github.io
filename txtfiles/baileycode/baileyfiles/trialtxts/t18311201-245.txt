. On the morning of the 10th of November I saw the prisoner at a broken pane of glass in our window; he had some kind of instrument - I saw him drawing out a pencil-case, and when he had very nearly got it out, I ran out, and pursued him; I saw about three others near him, as he was running - I took him; and as he was going to the watch-house, he threw away a pencil-case; he left this piece of whalebone, with a book to it, in the window.

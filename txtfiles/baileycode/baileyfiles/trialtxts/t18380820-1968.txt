THOMAS COX
. I live in Barlow-street, and am a cabman. On Friday night, the 17th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I had left my cab at the watch-house, in Bishopsgate-street, while I went in to get the address of a gentleman who had not paid me—I came out and went on to the Bank—I then missed my coat off my cab—I went back to the watch-house, and before I stated what I had to say, two men said they had got the man there—my coat has not been found.





JAMES RAYMOND WIIITHAIR
. I am the Superintendent of the City Police. I was passing by Bishopsgate watch-house, and saw the cab, and on

the driver's seat was a drab great coat with white pearl buttons—I went on to the corner of Wormwood-street—I there saw the prisoner and another man, and two women—the prisoner was going on with a great coat, which I considered to be the one I had seen on the cab—I said, "Where did you get that?"—he threw it at my feet, and ran off—I was some time before I could get my legs away from the coat—I then ran after the prisoner down to London-wall, where he was taken by an officer-while I was gone, some one had picked up the coat, and taken it away—I went to the watch-house, where I had seen the coat, and while I was there the cabman came and said he had lost his coat, and I told what I had seen.





THOMAS COX
. My coat had white pearl buttons.

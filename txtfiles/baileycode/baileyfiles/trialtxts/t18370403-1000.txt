RICHARD BRIDE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of March, 40lbs. weight of lead, value 12s., the goods of 



John Plummer and another; and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.






CHARLES COWARD
. I am a millwright in the employ of Mr. John Plummer and William Wilson, of Great Tower-street. Their factory is in Cubit-court, Golden-lane—I saw the lead safe there on the 8th or 9th of March—on the 16th of March, the policeman brought the lead—I fitted it to the roof of my master's factory—I am sure this is part of it—there are no marks on it any more than the fitting of it.





THOMAS MALIN
 (police-constable G 156.) I was on duty in Golden-lane about one o'clock in the morning of the 16th of March, and saw the prisoner running down Bell-alley with a smock frock on—he had something very heavy, which pulled him down on one side—I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Nothing at all"—I seized him and found it was lead—I sprung my rattle and said, "Where did you get this from?"—he said it was bis own—I took him to the station—I went back and found this small piece of lead near the premises—I have compared that with the other on the premises, and it fits exactly.

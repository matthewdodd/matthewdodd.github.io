             sworn. - I am a lace manufacturer

, in Owen's-row, Clerkenwell


, and have a partner, whose name is 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Beardmore
               



            .
- MACKWORTH sworn. - I am a warehouse-clerk to Messrs. Dawson and Beardmore.
Q. What was the prisoner, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Knowles
               



            ? - A. He was porter
 to the house: On the 23d of February, I sent the prisoner to clean out the little store-room; I had previously taken account of the goods lying in that apartment, and when he had cleaned the room, he sent the key to me; I went immediately and counted the goods over that laid in that room, and when I came to a lot of goods that consisted of thirty-six papers, in each paper I had counted a dozen of purses; when I came to count this lot of purses, instead of thirty-six papers, there were only thirty-two, there were two missing; they were lying on a shelf, marked No. 13; I communicated the circumstance to the accompting-clerk, 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



            , and to 
               
                  Francis 
                  Bristow
               



            , the warehouse-clerk; at half past five, the prisoner went to his tea; I saw the accompting-house clerk, 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



            , go after him, and in about five minutes after I saw the prisoner in the parlour with 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



             and Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Dawson
               



            ; I heard the prisoner deny having any goods alledged that he had stolen from the premises; and the charge being put close by 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



            , who said to him, we know that you have some of our property about you, he then said, that he had got one, and that was all he had about him; he then pulled them out of his pocket, and delivered them to 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



            ; I looked at it, it had my mark.
Q. Do you mean that you had put your mark on it that day? - A. Yes; then I went for a constable; the paper containing the purses was committed to the care of 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



            , the accompting-house clerk.
Q. Did Mr. Bristow take account of the papers as well as yourself? - A. Yes.
Q. Then he did not deliver up more than one paper? - A. No; not to me.
Q. What were the contents of that room? - A. Purses, stay-laces, and some garters.
Q. Had you marked them? - A. Yes, some of them, as well as some of the purses.
Q. Had you marked all the things in the room? - A. No.
- BRISTOW sworn. - I am a warehouse-clerk.
Q. Did you take account of these thirty-six papers? - A. Yes; there are thirty-six, which I believe contained purses, in each paper one dozen.
Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About half-past one o'clock: I went up after the last witness had informed me there were two papers missing, and I found there were two papers missing; after we got him into the parlour, 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



             challenged him with having some goods out of the warehouse; he said I have got nothing at all about me, but I know who has told you this, and the woman that has I will commence an action against her; I then told him it was a folly to deny it; we were certain that he had such and such goods about him; I told him we must have a constable and search him; Mr. Mackworth came to the door; then he gave up one dozen to 
               
                  Walter 
                  Dawson
               



            ; after Mr. Mackworth came in, he gave another dozen and some worsted garters; after he had given up these goods, I told him we should search his mother's house; he said, he hoped we would not do any thing to his mother, for there was not any thing of consequence there; only some trifling things that were in a basket.
Q. Where did the prisoner live? - A. In Islington-Road, with his mother, in one room.
- HANCOCK sworn. - I am a constable of the Public-Office, Hatton-Garden: the prisoner lived with his mother: on the 23d of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I found these articles I now produce tied up in a handkerchief, as they are now, excepting two articles that I found in a chest. (The articles produced.)
Q. What are these things? - A. A night-cap, a pair of cotton mitts, one silk sash, two cards of black trimming, two cards of white, sixteen pair of garters, cotton and worsted, fourteen dozen of cotton laces, and three pair of cotton gloves, these were in her room; I met her coming out of the house; she said she was going to buy a penny candle; I went into the butcher's shop and borrowed a candle, and when we came up stairs there was a candle burning in the room at the same time.
Q. Who knows any thing of these things that the prisoner delivered up himself?
Mackworth. A. These papers were delivered inmy presence, which now contains my mark, and the other paper of purse contains a ticket, the hand-writing of which I am well acquainted with; it was a warehouseman that lived with us, but has left the warehouse for some time.
Q. Can Mr. Dawson speak to the purse? - (Mr. Dawson looks at them.) A. I believe them to be of my manufactory, and as to the garters and laces I know them by passing through my hands at several times, and these articles, and what was delivered up by the prisoner in the parlour, I believe to be of my manufactory.
The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows: Being totally unable to have Counsel, we most humbly beg leave to state our unhappy case before this Honourable Court, not doubting but we shall have every mercy shewn us; I am in the 57th year of my age, have lost the use of my right arm, am in bad health, and very poor. My poor son is in the 24th year of his age, and very often troubled with deranged senses; he has had articles from his master to take out, and has had different articles to those he had to deliver, supposed to have been put up by mistake of his master or Mr. Mackworth, which articles have always been faithfully brought back. Now, with respect to the present business, it happened on the 23d of February, when I, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Knowles
               



            , was sent into a damaged ware-room, to clean it, he, Mackworth, came up, and gave me two dozen of purses and one dozen of stay-laces, which he told me to take to one Mr. Marley; in Long-Lane, West-Smithfield; it being tea time, he ordered me to go home and take the articles with me; however, I had not proceeded for, when I was informed my master wanted me; I was taken into the parlour; nobody was there but two clerks, excepting Mr. Dawson, and he told me I had robbed him; I said I had not robbed him; I know not what further I said to them; I have always been a faithful servant to my master, but for my character in general I refer you to my master; we, therefore, implore this most Honourable Court for mercy.
Q. (To Mackworth.) Had you delivered them to him to carry any where? - A. I never delivered to him on that day any thing of the sort.
Q. (To Dawson.) I suppose, by your continuing him in your employment, he behaved very well? - A. I knew nothing of him before, he came only from a neighbour's; where he lived I heard a good account of him.
The prisoner,

                  Knowles
               



            , called one witness, who gave her a good character.

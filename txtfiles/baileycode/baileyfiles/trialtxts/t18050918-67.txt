             sworn. - I live in Duke-street, Portland-place


: On the 13th of August I came out of the cutting-room into the shop; we are tailors

; I saw the prisoner with the articles under his arm; they were laying on the shelf in the shop; I had seen them about three minutes before.
Q. Upon your coming out and seeing him, what did he do? - A. He immediately dropped them; I stopped him; he was rather impertinent, he asked me whether he had them in his hand, or under his arm; he said, that would make a great difference; I said I should leave it to a Justice to settle; while I went to get an officer, he made his escape; I ran after him when I came back, and took him; I am sure he is the same man.
Prisoner's defence. I came in to buy an article that I had in my hand; I offered the prosecutor money for what I asked for.

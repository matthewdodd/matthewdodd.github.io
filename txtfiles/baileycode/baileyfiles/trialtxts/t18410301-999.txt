WILLIAM WOODWARD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of February, 150lbs. weight of lead, value 1l. 1s., the goods of 



Sir Edward George Earle Litton Bulwer, Baronet; and fixed to a certain building.






ALEXANDER MCCASKERY
 (police-sergeant V 14.) On the 13th of February I was on my beat at Fulham—I met the prisoner about a mile from the prosecutor's, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, wheeling a barrow—I asked what he was carrying—he said, "Slates"—I asked whose employ he was in—he said, "Mr. Dodd, of Fulham"—I asked him to open the bag, and let me see what he had got—he refused, and said he would go back to his employer's—I took'him, and found this leaden gutter in the sack which he was wheeling—I went on the prosecutor's premises, and found the whole leaden gutter had been taken from a stable—it fitted exactly—it had been wrenched off, and the nail holes tallied.





STEPHEN SIMPSON
. I am gardener to Sir Edward George Earle Litton Bulwer, Bart. I saw this lead fitted to the stable, where it had been fixed—it tallies in all respects—I know nothing of the prisoner.





GEORGE BOWER
. I live about two hundred yards from the prisoner—he borrowed a barrow of me that morning to take a sack of potatoes, as he said—he had a sack under his arm at the time.

Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. All his life—I had no suspicion of any thing wrong—I believe he has been out of work, and, by what I understand, rather distressed—he has a wife, but no family.




GUILTY
.** Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

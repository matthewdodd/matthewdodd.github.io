1738. 




MARTHA M'LAREN
 and the said 




HANNAH WELCH
 were indicted for

 stealing one jacket, value 8s.; and 3 half-crowns, the property of 



Thomas Campbell, and that M'Laren had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS CAMPBELL
. I am a sailor. I met M'Laren on the 6th of June and agreed to go home with her. We went to Welch's house—Welch was with her—she asked 3s. and I gave her 4s.—I turned into bed, and put my jacket and trowsers in the chair by the side of the bed—I had three half-crowns and some small silver in my trowsers' pocket—I awoke about seven o'clock and my jacket and money were gone—I called out, and Morriss, my shipmate, came up—he said his jacket was gone—I accused the prisoners of robbing me, and asked for my jacket—M'Laren told me it was up the spout—this is my jacket.

Welch. I asked you if you gave her the jacket, and you said "Yes."

Witness. No, I did not—I had said nothing to any one about the jacket till it was lost.





THOMAS JOSEPH BARRETT
. I took this jacket in pledge for 4s. about seven in the evening—both the prisoners were present—Welch has pawned things with us before—I asked if the sailor sent it—she said "Yes."

M'Laren. The prosecutor went home with me; I asked 5s.; he said he had not got that; he gave me 4s.; we went to bed, and awoke about four or five o'clock, and had some rum; he then said, "I want something to eat, but I have no money;" I said, "Shall I pawn your jacket?" he said, "Yes;" I went out; Welch fetched me back, and said, did he give me leave to pawn it; he said, "Yes."

Welch's Defence. I brought it back; he said, "You may do what you like with the jacket," and it was pawned.

JOHN LONG
. I live in Mount-cottage, Islington—my wife is a laundress—I was driving my cart through Pentonville on the 1st Dec.—I had bundles of linen in it—I saw the prisoner take a bundle out of the cart—I jumped out and followed him—he threw the bundle down, and witness stopped him—I am sure the prisoner is the person who took it—it contained the articles stated.

Crass-examined by
MR. WILDE. Q. This was at seven o'clock in the evening? A. Yes—I was driving and the horse was walking—it was up bill—I saw the prisoner take the bundle out—it is not a large cart, it it rather low—the bundle was by my side—I dare say I had eight bundles in the cart—this bundle was not behind me—I swear I saw him take it out—I sat in a sideway position, watching all the cart—I was looking at this bundle at that moment—I had not to pull up the horse—I jumped out—there was a lamp behind—this happened in College-street—the prisoner was caught about 300 yards off.


COURT. Q. Are you sure he is the man that took it? A. I am, and the man that threw it away.





JOHN BROWN

Cross-examined. Q. You never saw the prisoner before? A. No, bat I kept him.





JAMES WALLER

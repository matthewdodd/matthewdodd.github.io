, in Holborn


. On the 10th of May, in consequence of information, I pursued the prisoner down the street, and took her about three hundred yards from the shop with this printed cotton under her shawl; she said nothing, but refused to return with me. I had seen the cotton a quarter of an hour before laying inside the door.

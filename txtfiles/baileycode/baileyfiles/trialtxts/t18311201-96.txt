            . I am in the service of 
               
                  John 
                  Smith
               



            , he keeps a clothes shop
 in Basher's-court, Tottenham-court-road


. On the 9th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner looking at a pair of trousers hanging at the door; he shortly afterwards ran away - he passed me as I was at our other shop in Oxford-street, with the trousers in his hand; I pursued - he ran among some boys, and dropped the trousers behind him - he turned and faced me; I collared him, and called a Policeman, but no one came - he said, what did I collar him for; I said I wanted him - he said if I did not loose him he would knock me down; a mob came round, and they got him from me - he ran down a street in St. Giles', and into a house; I stood there till the Policeman came up - we went in and found him in the back kitchen; I said I believed that to be the person - a tall man came up, and would insist upon taking the light from the Policeman, and he sent me for another officer; the prisoner and the other man were both taken, but the other was released on bail - I believe the prisoner was the man; I have no doubt of it in my mind.

            . I am a Policeman. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and ran to the house; the witness was there; I went into the house and found the prisoner in the back kitchen - the witness pointed him out, and I took him; the landlord of the house came and took the light out of my hand, and put out the lights in the room, with a view to rescue him; it was in Buckeridge-street - the landlord was taken for an assault.

            . I returned from my work about four o'clock in the afternoon on the 9th of November, and found the prisoner at home; I am a French polisher, and had worked that day for Mr. Nobbs, at Hampstead - the job only lasted the day; I had lodged with the prisoner a little time, for about a month, in the back room on the ground floor, only I and the prisoner lodge there; we have not lodged together above a month; we do not always eat and drink together - we do at night, and sometimes when I am at home; I had not worked any where the day before - I have not had work for nine months -I had been a gentleman's servant; I lived with a captain in the army named Blades - I left him about twelve months ago; I was then doing jobs at French polishing with a young man who had learned me the French polishing - his name is Gorman; I then lodged at another place - I received half a crown for my day's work; I went away about six o'clock in the morning, and got there about seven o'clock - I returned about three o'clock from Hampstead, and got home about four o'clock; I do not reside in the kitchen; it is a ground-floor room - the landlord's name is Delaney - I believe he has not long been married; he does not occupy the kitchen - I believe the house is full of lodgers, but I do not live there now -I have left; when I got home the prisoner and I sat there till the officer came and took the prisoner away - there was only me and the prisoner in that room; Delaney came in afterwards for a candle - the prisoner and I had not been doing anything, only he smoked a pipe occasionally; our door being open, we heard a noise at the door, and the young man who stole the trousers came running up to our door, and said "I am sailed;" he went over the wall, over the water-butt - he had lodged in the house I have learned since; I do not know the meaning of the word nailed; upon my oath I have not the least idea what it meant - I did not ask the prisoner what it meant; I never heard the word nailed before - I never walked about the place much; I should know that man - I had seen him several times; he would have rushed into our room - I did not assist the landlord in the rescue; I sat still and never said a word; the prosecutor ought to know the man very well - the officer told him he was wrong, but he said he was not wrong.

            . I did not see this witness there at all. Witness. I can take my oath I was in the room at the time.
COURT. Q.Had you had any thing to eat and drink at Hampstead? A. Yes, my dinner; the man who ran through had a black coat and apron on - Baucutt, the witness, was not there; there were ten or twelve men in the house, but only two in that room - Baucutt was not there; it was a very thin young man, and the prisoner.

            . I lodged in that house, but I am no relation of the landlord's. The prosecutor has sworn to the wrong man; the prisoner had not been out of the house from two o'clock till the time the officer took him; he was ill in bed - he was in bed part of the time; he was in bed at five o'clock; the bed is in the room in the back-yard - I do not know how he came to get up; I have seen the man coming in - there is another witness that knows all about it; the person who went over the wall,now stands at the door - he had on that night a black coat, a white apron, and light trousers; the Policeman took this prisoner - the young man at the door lodged in the house; the last witness was at home with the prisoner.


                  THOMAS 
                  WOOD
               



            . The prisoner is not the one that committed the crime, which he has been put in prison for, stealing this pair of trousers; I was the man that did the crime, and I did it through want - I am the man that jumped over the wall, and the linen-draper said, this was the man, that took the trousers, but I was the one that took them; I have left the house, because the landlord told me, I had better go from there - I have got work since; I have not been before the Magistrate - I heard the prisoner was taken up; I left the house three or four days afterwards.

            . This witness is not the man; I never saw this man in my life, to the best of my knowledge - the woman who stood here said before that she was the wife of the prisoner, and she was gone out for beef-steaks for his supper at the time.

            . I did not say so, for my husband is in Ireland, and is a soldier. Witness. She said so immediately after we took the prisoner, and she followed us to Hatton-garden; she said so to me and the officer.

                  DAVIS
               



            . Yes, she did, and I allowed her to walk with the prisoner, thinking she was his wife, and she called him her dear husband.

            . I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Lawrence-street, and held him some time.

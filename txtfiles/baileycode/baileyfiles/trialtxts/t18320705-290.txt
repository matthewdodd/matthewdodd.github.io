            ; we live in Vine-street, near Tabernacle-square



. About May, the prisoner came to lodge at our house - he had a furnished room, at 4s. a week; he brought a person with him, who he said was his wife - they staid a fortnight; one Saturday night, in June, I ran up stairs, to go into another room, and saw his wife there - I then heard the door shut - I went up stairs again, and they were both gone - it was then about ten o'clock; they had left one candle on the stairs, and one on the mantel-piece - I missed the articles stated - I saw them safe when he had been one week with me; he did not pay me any rent - I have not seen any of the things since; my husband took the prisoner afterwards; he brought him to our house, and gave him in charge - he did not say any thing in my hearing.
Prisoner. Q. What time did I leave your house? A. About eight o'clock you came, and about ten you left - no one went into the room after you left; I went up in ten minutes, or in five minutes after you were gone; I then missed the articles - the door was wide open - you left me without notice.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was suddenly thrown into prison, without the means of letting my friends know, or I should have been able to contradict a great part of the evidence against me; if the prosecutor had been here, I could have asked him a few questions, which would have been of great consequence - I was not in the house after seven o'clock that evening.

. The prisoner took a furnished lodging at our house, on the 7th of March; he staid three weeks - he only paid one week's rent; on the 27th of March, at two o'clock, he borrowed a pen and ink, and soon afterwards I found the key of his door; I kept it till the next morning, when I called in an officer to open his room door; I found on the mantel-piece a small piece of writing, and the duplicate of two pillows and a blanket, which had been let to him with the room.

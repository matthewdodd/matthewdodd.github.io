 ++.


                  George
                   Forbes
               



            , Esq; Upon Sunday the 13th of August, I came from Dover; when I came to town, I stopped in Parliament-street, to set down a gentleman, then the trunk was behind the chaise; I got down and looked at it; the driver not knowing the way to Wellbeck-street, Cavendish-square, I ordered my servant to drive on before; when we came to my house, we found the trunk gone, the straps were cut. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I saw all these things put in the trunk at Dover. I sent to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's that very night, and the next day, or the day after, I was desired to attend there, where I was shewn the remains of my pocket book, and some remains of the writing half burnt, and several pieces of my trunk; they were produced by 
               
                  George
                   Strutton
               



            .
Q. Could you know the pieces of the trunk?
Forbes. Yes, there was a particular paper on the inside I know it by, there was a piece of a breast buckle produced by Noaks.


                  George
                   Strutton
               



            . Upon the 14th of August the Monday after Mr. Forbes lost his trunk, one Barrington came to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, with some burnt papers; the prisoner Cox lodged in his house and he had a suspicion they were burning some papers, they had not come honestly by; Dinmore and I went and searched Cox's lodging, we found nothing there; but, at a weaver's a few doors off the trunk was found, and Cox was there: I did not know Cox, when the landlord came down, the landlord said that was Cox, when I went back again, Cox was got up into the cock loft, I pulled off my cloaths, and went up there, and found the trunk and Cox together; I took the trunk to Sir John Fielding's, I have had the care of it ever since, it was broke all to pieces, and tied up in an old petticoat.
Q. from Cox. Who told you I was in the cock loft when you took me.
Strutton. Barrington went with Dinmore who is not here, Barrington saw him taken out, I took the trunk out afterwards, I did not see him taken out, I saw him in the house.


                  Joseph
                   Barrington
               



            . Last Sunday was a month, my chimney was a fire, at half after eleven o'clock, 
               
                  Mary
                   Putnam
               



             came down in the morning, and told me they were burning a parcel of paper.
Q. Who was in your house?
Barrington. 
               
                  John
                   Cox
               



            , 
               
                  Eleanor
                   Ogle
               



             and 
               
                  Mary
                   Putnam
               



            , they lodged in my house, there was in outcry of fire at half past eleven; I got up and went on the stair-case, and heard a man say, that lives in the house, that there was no danger, then I went to bed again; in the morning about seven o'clock I saw these papers and books in some water; I took them up and carried them to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, because I thought they were not honestly come by; I saw both Cox and the trunk taken out of the cock loft.
Cox. When he was examined in Bow-street, he said, I was not at home; now he says I was at home.
Barrington. At the time of the fire, I am certain 
               
                  Eleanor
                   Ogle
               



            , who passes for Cox's wife, was at home and a man who lodges in the house, for I heard them: I am not certain to Cox's being at home; the fire was in Cox's room.
Strutton. Barrington delivered the books and papers to me (they were produced in court.)
Mr. Forbes. Here is half of my pocket book, it has my own hand writing on it, and part of a day-book that I can swear to, I cannot be so positive to the trunk, there may be another like it.


                  James
                   Honey
               



            . I am a servant to Mr. Forbes, I know that to be my master's writing; I saw it at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's: here is part of a French grammar that belongs to me; I was with my master when he came from Dover; that French grammar was in the trunk. I am certain this is the same trunk, I know it by the handles; I had the key of it, it fitted the lock when I tried it at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; but would not go in, because the lock was broke: I have not the key now.
Q. Could you swear to the trunk by the handles?
Honey. I can swear to it by the lock.
Q. from Cox. Did you swear to the trunk at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's?
Honey. Yes. I did.


                  Mary
                   Puttnam
               



            . Between the hours of eleven and twelve, on last Sunday was a month, the prisoner Ogle, called me up into her room; she lodges in the two pair of stairs, and I in the one pair of stairs, in Barrington's-house; I went in and saw a great smother; there was a large fire, I took some of the papers off and threw them into some water; a person in the next house saw it, and went and told my landlord. I did not know they were any thing of consequence; when I went up again, 
               
                  Eleanor
                   Ogle
               



             opened the closet and shewed me a large trunk with linen and cloaths. Cox was not then at home.

Q. What became of the papers you threw out?
Puttnam. They were some of them picked up by Barrington; these produced were some of them; I saw a vast quantity of shirts, how many I cannot say; I saw a pair of stone and a pair of silver buttons: Cox and Priestly came into the room between two and three o'clock and one Pat Nowland and they expected a Jew woman to come in the morning to buy some of the things; I heard them say so; she came about seven in the morning; I was not in the room when she bought the things; I met her coming down stairs with a great bundle, I am sure she carried none up.
Q. Was Priestly there as well as Cox and Ogle, in the morning?
Puttnam. Yes.


                  John
                   Noaks
               



            . I am a constable; the landlord came up to Sir John Fielding's, and said this Puttnam could give a particular account of these people. I went to his house and she gave me this bosom of a shirt (producing it)
Puttnam. I picked that piece of a shirt up upon the stairs.
Mr. Forbes. It is mine.
Noakes. She said she would tell the truth, that is all I know of it.
Q. from the Jury to Barrington. Did Priestly lodge at your house?
Barrington. No. I never saw him before.
Cox's Defence.
I know nothing about it; I was at my mother's from eight at night to three in the morning.
Priestly's Defence.
I know nothing of it.
Ogle's Defence.
I was at my mother's.
Cox 

               Guilty
            .
Priestly 

               acquitted
            .

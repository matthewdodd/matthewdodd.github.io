FREDERICK CHARLES GOODWIN
. About eight o'clock on Monday morning, the 19th of Feb., I went to my stable and missed my harness—it was safe the night before—part of this harness is Mr. Daniel Wilson's, and some of Dr. John Winder's.





JAMES CLIFFORD
 (police-constable G 91.) On Monday morning, about half-past six o'clock, on the 19th of Feb., I was on duty in Old-street—I saw the prisoners in company, each carrying a large bundle containing this harness—I asked Collins where he got it—he said from Mr. Martin of Spitalfields, but he could not tell the name of the street—I asked if Smith was his wife—he said she was, but Smith denied it at the station-house—another officer came and took her.

Smith's Defence. I have kept company with Collins about six months; I was walking about, and saw Collins; he said he was going to Spitalfields; I left him, and two hours after I met him in Old-street with two bundles; he said, "If you like to carry one a little way, you may;" I was going to return it to him, when I was taken.





JAMES CLIFFORD

re-examined. I stopped the prisoners within seventy yards of where the harness was stolen from.

            . I live in Duke-street, Bloomsbury


. My watch hung on the shelf in my parlour. I was cleaning my door-step, the prisoner passed me, and went up the street, while I was cleaning my railing - He ran in and came out. I tried to stop him in my passage - He threw me down and got off; I am sure he is the boy. I missed my watch - He was taken eight days after.

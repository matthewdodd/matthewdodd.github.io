            . On Monday, the 30th of January, I was in Golden-lane, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoner with a bundle - I asked what he had got there; he said a piece of stuff - I asked where he got it; he said from Wilson-street - I asked where he was going to take it; he said to Wilson-street - I said, "You said you got it from there;" he said, "No, I got it from Goswell-street."

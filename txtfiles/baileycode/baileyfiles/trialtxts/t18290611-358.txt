            , the elder.
TIMOTHY CONNER. I was working at Mr. George Sex's, Sen., Stonecutter-street, Fleet-market


, and moved some copper to the hay-loft, from a place twenty or thirty yards off.
WILLIAM FITZGERALD. I work for Mr. Sex. I was ordered by Mr. Pickrell to take some copper into the hayloft; I cannot tell how much there was - the prisoner worked there.

            . I am a bricklayer. I employed these witnesses in repairs at Mr. Sex's: the copper was taken into the loft on the 4th or 5th of May: my scaffolding lay there - there were 60 or 70 lbs. of copper, and three pieces out of four were missing - they must have weighed near 60lbs.; I missed it on Saturday week - I have seen some like it since; the prisoner had access to the loft.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Stanley, of Shoe-lane. I have 28 1/2lbs. of copper; I bought half of it of the prisoner on the 6th of June; he said it was his own - he was alone.
ROBERT PICKRELL. I believe this to be some of the copper - there is no mark on it.
Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing to do with the copper.

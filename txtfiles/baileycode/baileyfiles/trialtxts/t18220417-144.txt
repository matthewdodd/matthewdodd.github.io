                  BIDGOOD
               



            . I am a carpenter, and live in Castle-street. On the 15th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoners standing against Mr. Parkinson's window, at the corner of Winslow-street


. I passed them twice, suspecting them. Foxhall was with me, and watched them for five minutes - I then saw them both lift the stall-board off the window, and Sherlock put it on his shoulder. He went into Castle-street, where I stopped him. Williams ran away; I described him, and he was apprehended next day; I am certain of him.

            . I am a watchman. I was with Bidgood, and saw the prisoners by the shop very busy, and saw them take the moulding off the window; Sherlock put it on his shoulder. Bidgood seized him, and Williams ran off. I saw him next morning, and am positive of him.

                  Robert 
                  Henry Parkinson

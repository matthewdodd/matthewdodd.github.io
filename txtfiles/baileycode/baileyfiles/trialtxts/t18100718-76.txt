            'S. I am an officer. on the 13th of July, in the evening, there was a fire in Titchfield-street


. I saw the two prisoners in the crowd, I knew them, and watched them; I observed them attempt to pick several gentlemen's pockets, I followed them close; I saw Rogers pick a gentleman's pocket of his handkerchief, and I saw Batoat receive it of him. I laid hold of Rogers, as soon as Batoat saw me lay hold of Rogers, he threw the handkerchief down and put his foot upon it; a young man by me I desired to lay hold of Rogers, he did so; and took the handkerchief up, I took them to the office.

            . I was with Humphry's at the fire; I saw Roger's take from the gentleman this handkerchief, and give to Batoat; Humphreys collared Rogers. I laid hold of Batoat, he dropped the handkerchief, and put his foot upon it; I took it up.
The prisoner's said nothing in their defence, nor called any witnesses to their character.

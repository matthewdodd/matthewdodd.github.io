                   , putting him in fear, and taking from him a Hat, value 15 s. and a Wig, value 12 s.
             the 23d of this Instant February
.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That he and his Wife, having been to see a Friend, was going home, and in Holbourn


 being between 12 and 1 o'Clock, they haled his Wife, he having occasion to make Water; that there the Prisoners came up to them, and damning them, ask'd them, what they did there? and one of them hit him a slap on the Face, and the other came abroad side, and Ryland snatch'd off his Hat and Wig, and ran away; but he seiz'd Eaton, and he desir'd him to make no Noise, and he shou'd have his Hat and Wig again, and begg'd to be let go; but he told him, he would never part with him, but by the living God, he would live and die with him, rather then he should get away; and the Watch coming, he charg'd them then with the Prisoner, and afterwards meeting with Ryland, he charg'd them with him also.
- Fortington confirm'd her Husband's Evidence, adding, That one of them came to her, and pull'd her Hood over her Face. The Fact being plainly prov'd 


               as to the Felony, the Jury found them both Guilty of that; but the Prosecutor being a Man of so much Courage, did not seem to be put in much fear, whereupon they acquitted them of the Robbery
            .

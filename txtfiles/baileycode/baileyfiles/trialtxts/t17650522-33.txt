            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I am an haberdasher
 and hosier
: a pane of glass was broke in our shop window on the 22d of April, between eight and nine in the evening, and a bundle of stockings taken out. I was in the shop at the time. I went immediately to the door, but found it tied with a strong cord, so that I could not get out till they were gone out of sight: I never saw the prisoners, to my knowledge, till I was sent for to Justice Welch's the next day. There were the two prisoners and another, who was admitted evidence, and five pair of stockings: to the best of my knowledge, I believe they are mine. (Produced in court.)

            . Last Monday was a month, the two prisoners and I went to St. Alban's-street



, to the prosecutor's house; Newgent tied the door that it should not come open: Cox broke the glass and took out eleven pair of stockings: we divided them, three pair each, and the two odd pair were left in my custody; so I had these five pair. The constable found them upon me. Newgent call'd me up to make away with the stockings; I would not go, but went in again, and to bed, and the constable came and took me. I was taken before Justice Welch; there I said I bought the stockings in the street: the Justice asked me how I came to buy so many at once; I could give no satisfactory answer; then I confessed the same as now.

            . I am constable: I had seen Hull about the Ruins of St. Giles's, and knew him to be a pick pocket: on the 23d of April, seeing him go into a house, I followed him in; he was got into bed; he had this bundle of stockings under him: I asked him how he came by them; he said he bought them: There was Wilcox in another bed in the room, along with 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Davis 
               



            , and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Agate 
               



             who was with Hull: I put Hull in the round-house, and then went for Wilcox, and carried them before Justice Welch. Wilcox's father came and appeared for him; he was discharged: after Hull made this discovery, Wilcox was taken again.
Q. to Hull. What did Wilcox do with his three pair of stockings?
Hull. I do not know; he had them in bed under his pillow when I was taken.

The prisoners both denied knowing any thing of the affair.

(M.) Wilcox was a second time indicted for 


               stealing twenty handkerchiefs, value 3 l.
             the property of 
               
                  
                     Ann 
                     Wilson

            . I live in Fetter-lane



, and am a hosier
 and haberdasher
: on Saturday the 20th of April, about nine at night, I was sitting in my shop, and heard a pane of glass break; a gentlewoman that was with me opened the door, and cried Stop thief; but I did not see any body; there were upwards of twenty handkerchiefs they had taken away. On Thursday following I was sent for to Mr. Welch's; there I saw two handkerchiefs, I believe to be my property, and after that the Constable found six more, which I believe to be mine.

            . I think it was this day five weeks, about nine in the evening, 
               
                  Tom 
                  Cox 
               



             and I went into Fetter-lane, and broke the glass of this woman's shop (describing the situation of it) and took out some handkerchiefs. I could run faster than he and he was to meet me in Lincoln's-Inn Fields. I ran very fast; there might some handkerchiefs drop by the way; when we counted them, there were but fourteen of them; we had seven each. I sold two, and desired 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Agate 
               



             to pawn three for me, which she did. Cox sold some, and some he gave to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Davis 
               



             to pawn.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Agate 
               



            . I believe I pawned three of these handkerchiefs; one in King-street, the others facing St. Giles's church: Hull and the prisoner came home together, when they brought them, and called me out of bed about ten o'clock.


                  Sarah 
                  Davis 
               



            . I was in Covent Garden, and did not see Hull and the prisoner come home that night with the handkerchiefs. I came home about twelve at night, they were both there. The next morning, being Sunday, I saw three handkerchiefs, one was about Wilcox's neck, the other two under his head, which two he gave me to pawn: I pawned one in St. Giles's and the other in King-street. I went afterwards, when they were taken out.

            . When the two girls were taken up, we found where six handkerchiefs were pawned: we went and got them; (produced in court) and two others were found among the stockings upon Hull. Hull gave the same account before the Justice as he has now.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all about it.

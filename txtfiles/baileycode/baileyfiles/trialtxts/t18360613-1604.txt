1604. 




THOMAS WHITTON
 and 




GEORGE PHILLIPS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
12th of May, 5 yards of printed cotton, value 3s. 9d., the goods of 




William Feary.






RACHEL FEARY
. I am the wife of William Feary; we keep a shop at West Ham, in Essex. On the 12th of May, between one and two o'clock, I had put this print in my window—I went up-stairs, and had not been gone above three minutes when my daughter called me down—I came down, and the print was gone—I went out of the shop—I did not see any one—a boy showed me where they were gone to—I went to the Marsh-gate—I saw the two prisoners in the act of doubling up my print in a handkerchief—I took it from them, and said, "You villains, you have stolen this from me"—they then threw two more parcels down—I took up my own, and called "Stop thief" and two witnesses, now here, caught them and took them to the station-house—I am sure they are the same—they were not out of my sight till they were taken—this is my print—this handkerchief belongs to the prisoners—here are five yards and a half of cotton of mine—I had not seen the prisoners near my shop—they were a hundred yards from the shop when I first saw them.





RICHARD WARD
. I was having a pint of beer, and heard the lady sing out "Stop thief"—I stopped Whitton.





JOHN MERRY
. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and pursued Phillips, and took him to the station-house.





PHINEAS BUTLER
 (police-constable K 222). I was at the station-house,

and the prisoners were brought there with this property, of the prosecutor's, and these other two parcels.

Whitton. We saw the bundles on the ground in Marsh-gate-lane, and picked them up, but did not go away with them.
(John Green, a shoemaker, of Parliament-court, Artillery-lane; and Richard Cas, deposed to Phillip's good character; and W. Holmes, a shoe-manufacturer, to that of Whitton's)

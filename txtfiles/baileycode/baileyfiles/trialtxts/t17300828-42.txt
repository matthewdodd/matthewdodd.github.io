             depos'd, He had miss'd Gold and Silver Plate before, but could not tell who had it, till a Piece being missing, it was found upon the Prisoner Guys, who was a Boy he employ'd to go of Errands; who upon his Examination, confess'd, that he had taken six or seven Parcels, and had sold it at several times to the Prisoner Bouchet; and that he had not done it, but that being sent by his Master to buy some Plate of Bouchet, he told him, that if he had any thing to sell, he bought as well as sold, and that he carried him a Piece of Gold, value 32 s. for which he gave him but 4 s.
Several Evidences depos'd, That the Boy did at his first Discovery six the receiving of the Plate upon the Prisoner Bouchet, and did persist in it for three Weeks; but prevaricating upon his Trial, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment; but there wanting Proof to fix the receiving of the Plate upon Bouchet, he was 

               acquitted
            .

            . I keep a linen draper's shop
, the sign of the Unicorn, in the Strand


. On the 20th of November
 last, at half past five in the evening, I was standing at the shop door, and saw the prisoner, in company with another, picking pockets; at six the prisoner, with another person, came into my shop, stood a little way in, and held the door in his hand: the prisoner asked me if I knew one Thomson; and before I could answer him, the other person put his hand into the window, and laid hold on eleven silk handkerchiefs, and ran away with them. I then seized the prisoner, and pulled him into the shop, and then went out to the door, but perceived that the other was so far gone, it was in vain to attempt to overtake him: I came back to the shop, sent for a constable, and carried the prisoner directly before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , where he was known very well, and said he was an old offender.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going down the Strand, and asked this gentleman where Mr. Thomson lived, he immediately called out that I had robbed him. I am a lapidary
 by trade.

JOHN DEVALL
. I am carman to James Lys Seager—he has three parttners—they are distillers—on Thursday, Nov. 9th. between five and six o'clock, I was in the cellar of the Duke's Head, in Mint-street—my van stood at the door—I came back to it, and missed this metal crane (produced)—it is to draw the pin off, and is Seager and Co.'s property.





JAMES BURTON
 (policeman, M 272). In consequence of information, on 9th Nov., between five and six o'clock, I went to some ruins in Mint-square, about 200 yards from the Duke's Head—I heard a noise as of something breaking—I got through the pailing, and saw the prisoner who I knew before, and another, run away—I followed them through the courts into the Mint, and there lost sight of them—I went back, and found this crane in the broken state it now is—I told another constable, and he took the prisoner.

Prisoner. I was hard at work at the time, you knew where I lived? Witness. I did not—I did not see you afterwards, till you were taken.





JOHN DELANY
 (policeman, M 100). I received information, and took the prisoner on the 20th—I said I wanted him on suspicion of stealing a pipe from a wagon, the property of Seagcr and Co., in Mint-street—he said he knew nothing about it, he was at work at the time.

Prisoner. Q. You knew where I lived? A. I did not, you change your residence so often—I searched your old house, and all the places about, and could not find you.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at work till half-past seven o'clock.

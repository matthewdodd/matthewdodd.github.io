GEORGR SPENCER. I live in Stanhope-street


, and am a tailor
. I lost this piece of cloth on the 11th of August, about half-past one o'clock - I had seen it about an hour before; I did not miss it till it was brought back by the officer, who had Smith and Webb in custody.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the afternoon of the 11th of August I was going through Broad-court, out of Bow-street, and Boston told me the three prisoners were about to commit a felony; I followed them to Stanhope-street, Clare-market, where I saw Wilkinson pop into the shop, and come out again; Smith then took the cloth, and gave it to Webb; I took Webb, and Boston took Smith; I took the cloth back to the shop.

            . I am a porter. I met Jones, and told him the prisoners were together, and I had watched them from Oxford-road; we followed them. I saw Smith take this cloth, and give it to Webb; Wilkinson had looked into the shop, and then went and stood at the next door. I took Smith, but Wilkinson got away.

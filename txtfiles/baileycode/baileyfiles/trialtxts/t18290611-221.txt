JAMES MCINTOSH. I am a carpenter
. I had been working with these tools the day before they were missed; I had gone out at four o'clock to look for a better job - I know this plane and spoke-shave to be mine.

            . I am a watchman. On the 9th of May, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner on my beat nearly a mile from the prosecutor's - I saw something bulky in his bosom, and asked what he had got; he refused to tell me - I opened his waistcoat, and found this bag and tools; he tried to get away, but I took him to the watch-house.
Prisoner. I told him where I got the tools from. Witness. No; he told the watch-house-keeper that he got them from Mr. McIntosh to grind.
JAMES MCINTOSH. I did not send him - he had lodged in my house before, but not then; I never gave him leave to take them; he came to me, and said he had no money to pay for a lodging, and I told him to go and lie down in the kitchen, but not to come to me any more.

            . I live in the Poultry. I was going down Saffron-hill, and saw the prisoner standing by the shop with his hands behind him, unpinning a waistcoat. I staid a few minutes, he left off and began again - and took it, and ran up a passage. I ran in and told the shopman, and we stopped him with it.

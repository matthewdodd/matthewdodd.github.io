             sworn.
I am a hackney coachman
: I lost eight shillings on Monday, the 8th of October, between one and two in the morning; I was waiting at the Piazza Coffee House, and was asleep in my coach; I was quite sober; I had been sitting some time, and I felt something go out of my breeches pocket; I jumped up, and the prisoner got out of the coach; I never lost sight of him, and pursued him: I charged him with the watch; he was searched in the watch-house; nothing was found upon him; my breeches were cut. (Produced cut at the bottom of the pocket.)
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. When this man was searched there was only threepence found upon him? - I don't know. -
Did not you offer to let him go about his business if he would give you eight shillings? - I asked him for my money again.

             sworn.
I am a watchman in Covent-garden; the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, and I took him to the watch-house.
Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.
The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.

Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

 last, in the Night
            .
Philip Baron thus deposed: I keep an Undertaker's Shop
 near the Watch-house in Holborn



: My House was broke open three times; that is, on the 1st, the 13th, and 22d of August. From several Circumstances, I had Reason to think that it had been done by somebody that was acquainted with the House; and I suspected nobody more than the Prisoner, who was a Neighbour's Apprentice
, and lived a very loose, idle Life. In about a Week after the last time I was robb'd, I heard that he was put into S. Sepulchre's Watch-house for stealing a Game-Cock.
Edward Baron thus deposed: I went to see the Prisoner in the Watch-house, and found one of my Shirts upon his Back, which was left that Night the House was broke open.

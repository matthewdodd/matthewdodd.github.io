ISABELLA DAVISON
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 table-cloth, value 5s.; the goods of 




Frederick Edwards.






ELIZABETH JEANNETTE EDWARDS
. I am the wife of Frederick Edwards, a draper, of Gloucester-street, Queen-square. The prisoner came to lodge with us on 22nd Oct.—she brought a gentleman with her, and represented him as her husband—she was with us on 28th Oct,—during that time I missed a table-cloth—the prisoner asked me for one, as that one was gone to wash, as a cup of coffee was spilled over it by her husband—I gave her another—she left me on 9th Nov.—I did not know she was going—she had not paid her rent—this is the table-cloth (produced)—it is mine—it is the one she told me the cup of coffee had been spilled over.

Cross-examined by
MR. STAMMERS. Q. Yours were furnished lodgings? A. Yes; and the table-cloth was for her use.





HENRY LAWRENCE
, I live with a pawnbroker. I tool in this table-cloth, on 28th Oct., for 1s. 6d., of the prisoner.




GUILTY
.* Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

SARAH TOWNE
. I keep a china shop in Seabright-place, Hackney-road On Saturday last, about half-past two o'clock, Mr. Brown brought in Pepperell, who had eighteen of my plates, which were safe on a shutter under my window three minutes before—he left Pepperell in my custody, and went out after some others—Pepperell cried very much, and begged to be set free—White was then brought in—I knew him well by having seen him about my place a great deal, and I have often told him if he did not go about his business, I would call the policeman—the plates produced are mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Had Pepperell his apron over the plates? A. Yes.





ISHMAEL BROOM
. I am a tailor—I live next door to the prosecutrix. About half-past two o'clock that day I was sitting, on my shop-board, and saw the three prisoners come to the prosecutrix's shop, all together—they then made a sudden start, and went away—White and Pepperell returned—White reached over some jars, and got these plates out—Pepperell received them of him—Harrod was about eight or nine yards off—Pepperell put his apron over the plates—I took him, and told the prosecutrix—I then went and took White.





STEPHEN MANSFIEL
. (police-constable N 288.) I went to the prosecutrix's shop, and found White and Pepperell there, and these plates on a chair—Harrod was a short distance off, and I went and took him.
(Harrod and Pepperell received good characters.)

MARIA STEVENS
. I live in Clerkenwell. On the 24th of Aug. I was passing the prosecutor's in Exmouth-street, and I saw the prisoners together—I saw Hewitt take a petticoat from the side of the rail at the side of the shop, and put it under her shawl—they both walked away—I gave information—they were taken, and the petticoat found on them.

Hewitt. Q. Did you not say at first it was Bennett took it, and afterwards say it was me? A. No.





JAMES HARMAN
. I live with Robert Watt, in Exmouth-street. I received information, and ran after the prisoners—when I got close to them Hewitt took the petticoat from under her shawl, and threw it in at a door way—this is my master's.





RICHARD BYRNE
 (police-constable E 116.) I produce a certificate of Hewitt's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

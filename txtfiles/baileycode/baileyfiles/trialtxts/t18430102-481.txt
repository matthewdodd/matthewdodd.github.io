WILLIAM POTTER
. I keep a toy-shop in Church-street West, Edgware-road. On the evening of the 19th of Dec. I had a glass-case on my counter, containing a dozen and a half of pocket-knives—I saw it safe about half-past four o'clock, and missed it about a quarter to seven—this is the case.





THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant D 4.) I took this case from the prisoner about six o'clock that evening, about 300 yards from the proseentor's shop—he said he found it in a tub—another one ran away when I stopped the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I found it in going over Westminster-bridge, and was going to take it home.





THOMAS RANSON
 (police-constable D 85.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)-the prisoner is the person.

1728. 




WILLIAM WALL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of June, at 


St. Mary, Newington, 6 spoons, value 20s.; 6 sovereigns, 2 half-sovereigns, 12 half-crowns, and 20 shillings; the goods and monies of 



Sarah Colson, his mistress, in her dwelling-house.






SARAH COLSON
. I am a widow, and live at No. 4, Trafalgar-row, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. I keep a coal-shed, and the prisoner was my errand-by for two years and a half—I gave him 2s. a week, and his ten and supper—on the 14th of June I went out in the morning for about twenty minutes—when I returned the prisoner was standing at the door-post—he went out the back way and absconded—I went up stairs in less than a quarter of an hour, and missed the money stated in the indictment from a drawer in my back room, and six spoons—I received information, and went to No. 4, George-street, with a policeman, and took the prisoner—I had left no one at home but him and a little infant, who was asleep—he had opened the drawer with a knife.





BENJAMIN PAWLEY
. On the 12th of June I saw the prisoner sitting on a barrow, at Mr. Colson's house—he said there was a drawer in Mr. Colson's where he could get 9l. or 10l—I had known him about two years.

Prisoner. It is false—I never told him so.





JOHN PUCH
. I am a policeman. I found the prisoner wearing a new smoke-frock, a handkerchief, and a hat, but no money was found on him—he was taken on the Sunday night, as this happened on the Wednesday.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Life.

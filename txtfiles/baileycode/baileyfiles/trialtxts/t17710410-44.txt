                   Sinclair
               



            . I live in Newman-street, Oxford Road



. When I went to bed upon Tuesday the twelfth of March I observed the lower part of my house was secure; I did not look at the dining room window, where I found afterwards the people came in. About five in the morning, Mr. Mason, a neighbour, alarmed me, that my house was broke open; the street door was ajar, and the sash was thrown up; I found the door open, and in the passage my sword drawn, which was over night in my parlour; and also a large weighty canister of sugar. I observed a good many things upon the parlour floor, a pair of shoes, and a hat, and a joiner's tool or instrument; in the back parlour my bureau was broke open, and a great number of papers scattered about the room; my pocket book was taken away, in which was a bank note of 20 l. that was taken away from the upper part of the bureau; I saw it there the night before; there was a silver waiter taken from the fore parlour; and the silver table knives and forks gone from off the slab; from some drawers in my bureau I lost a number of callico shirts, muslin neckcloths, seven pair of cotton stockings, and four pair of silk, and certain other goods; the sash of the middle window was up, and the shutters pushed back; there are three windows in the dining room; I suppose the persons got up by the lamp iron. There being a ledge, about six inches broad, running under these windows, I suppose they got along upon that ledge, and put up this middle sash; both the other windows and the shutters were fast; I published an advertisement of this matter; I was sent for on the Monday following to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; Isaacs said, that one Pollock in St. Giles's was the man to whom they generally carried their stolen things; we took out a warrant to search Pollock's house. Upon Tuesday morning I went to Taylor the constable, and we searched Pollock's houses; upon the right hand going in there was a search made; I found nothing belonging to me but an old India stocking; I knew it by a particular mark made with a stuff they have in that part of the world; it was marked at St. Helena by my washerwoman, in order to distinguish it; here is another stocking which has the same mark; we found this in a drawer at Pollock's, upon the right hand as you enter into the house; I am satisfied it is my stocking, and one that was taken out of my house that night; Pollock was examined a day or two after by Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ; he said there, he did not know how he came by this stocking; at Mr. Welch's, Butcher owned that he was in my house; when this Butcher and Haines were examined at Mr. Welch's it was at the same time Mrs. Moore's robbery was under examination; he owned he was at my house.
Q. Did you hear that Butcher had any promise of favour made to him?
Mr. Sinclair. I heard he had been closeted; and from the frank answers he gave to the questions put to him, I looked upon him to be an evidence; I was surprized when Mr. Welch told me he was not. I took up a hat in my fore parlour; Haines, at Mr. Welch's, claimed that hat as his; Butcher had mentioned, that he and the rest of them were concerned in breaking open my house. I went on the Friday after I was robbed to the Bank; I could not get the number of the note sooner; there I found the note had been paid; 
               
                  John
                   Davis
               



            , King-street, Westminster, was written upon the back of it, as having received the money; Butcher, at Mr. Welch's told me he was the man that had received the note; I mentioned 
               
                  George
                   Davis
               



             as the name endorsed upon the note; Butcher set me right, and said it was 
               
                  John
                   Davis

            . I am servant to Mr. Sinclair; I went to bed about one o'clock; I am sure the sash was shut down, and the window shutters fastened. When we were alarmed, I came down, and found my master's sword, and the other things, in the situation he has mentioned. I am certain this is my master's stocking.


                  William
                   Taylor
               



            . I am a constable. Upon the eighteenth of March, Mr. Sinclair got a warrant to search Pollock's house, in Brown's Gardens, St. Giles's; we searched it next morning. There is a little press upon the right hand, going into the kitchen; in one of the drawers, was a quantity of old stockings, among which Mr. Sinclair pulled out these; I have had them, ever since, in my custody. Pollock was not at home; I went to him next morning, when he was at home; he went with me to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's.
Butcher's Defence.
Mr. Sinclair told me, if I would open the affair he would get me admitted an evidence.
Q. to Mr. Sinclair. How is that?
Mr. Sinclair. I thought he was a witness.
Butcher. Upon Tuesday I was brought before Mr. Welch, as I understood, to be made a witness; then I opened Mrs. Moore's affair. Mr. Welch said, that would not do unless I would likewise tell what I knew of Mr. Sinclair's business; and then, he said, I should be sworn; and upon that promise it was that I gave the account of it.
Haines's Defence.
I know nothing about this business.
Pollock's Defence.
I was not at home when they came to search my house; when I came back, I was told they had been there to search, and would come back again. I intended, of my own record, to have gone to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             the next morning, but Taylor came before I went, and so I went with him.
For Pollock's Character.

            . I live in Theobald's Row; I have known him nine or ten years; I always looked upon him to be an honest man. I have lent him money; he always paid me honestly again. He has a general good character.

                   Scandett
               



            . I have known him five years: I have had dealings with him; he never defrauded me. I do not go by hear-say, but speak what I know myself.

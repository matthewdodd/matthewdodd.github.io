JAMES ABEL. I am a wheelwright
. On the 16th of December I met the prisoner, with two planes in his hand, which I knew to be mine; I asked him where he was going to take them - he said a man gave them to him to carry to a new building in Hare-street-fields; I told him I would show him where he took them from. I took hold of him, but he said he would not go with me. I had left my little girl to mind my shop while I went out, but her mother was obliged to send her out. The planes had laid on my bench.(Property produced and sworn to.)

JOSEPH TIBBY
. I live in Hart-street, Covent-garden, and am a fallowchandler. At half-past twelve o'clock at noon, on the 15th of July, I placed a towel and a waistcoat across the bannister of my landing-place, to dry—I did not miss them, as I was not at home—these are them (looking at them.)





ESTHER PAINE
. I am the wife of William Paine, and live on the second floor of the same house. About two o'clock that afternoon I was coming out of my room, and saw the prisoner going out with these things—I asked what he wanted—he said a person of the name of Lush—I said no such person lived there—I then asked what he wanted of him—he said he bad got a waistcoat for him—I asked him to let me look at it—I found it was my brother's waistcoat, and the towel—I stopped him and the things—the prosecutor is my brother.




GUILTY
.* Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.

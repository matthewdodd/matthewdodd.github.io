Ben. Johnson. On the 6th of August, between twelve and one, I was going under Newgate


, (and as I had lost three handkerchiefs before, it made me the more cautious ) I thought I felt something bobbing against my pocket, and I saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, and saw him put it into his bosom; and I took it from him.

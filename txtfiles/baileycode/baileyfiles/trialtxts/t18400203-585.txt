JOHN LLOYD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of January, 4 knives, value 1s. 4d., the goods of 



James Dangerfield.






AMELIA DANGERFIELD
. I am the wife of James Dangerfield, and live in Queen-street, Pimlico. Between nine and ten o'clock on the morning of the 14th of January, the prisoner came to our shop for a halfpenny-worth of nails—I stooped to pick up a piece of paper to put the nails in, and during that time he must have gone to the centre of the window and took the knives—I did not see him take them, but when I went to him the knife which was tied outside the parcel dropped—he took it up, and said he was going

to give it to me—I had swept the shop just before, and know it was not there—I looked in the window, and found the place where they had been empty—in going to the station-house he threw the other knives into a dust-hole, and the policeman picked them up.

Prisoner. I picked them up on the floor, and before I could give them to you you gave me in charge. Witness. No—he picked up one, and I took it from him—he did not say any thing about having picked up the others—they were under his jacket.





WILLIAM CROPTON SEVERS
 (police-constable P 113.) I was called, and took the prisoner. On the way to the station-house we came opposite a dust-hole in Ebury-square, and he threw the remainder of the knives in there—here is the one he had first, and these are the others.
(Richard Harris, a porter, Little Queen-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 11.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

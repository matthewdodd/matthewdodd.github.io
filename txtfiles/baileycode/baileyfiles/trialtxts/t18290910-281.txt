            . I am a street-keeper of St. Andrew, Holborn


. On the 28th of July, I saw the prisoner and another standing a few yards from Mr. George Chapell's shop; I crossed the way and watched them - I saw the other snatch this hat from the door, run up a little court and give it to the prisoner - I ran and took one of them in each hand; they struggled, and my hat fell off - the other got away, but I kept the prisoner and the hat.
Prisoner. I could not run; I have lost the use of one side - I was coming home, saw the paper and took it up; he came and took me - I said, "Mr. Holland, I have not taken the hat, I picked it up;" he had a row with in mother and said he would do something with us.

            . It never was on the ground at all; the other tore the paper off and gave it to the prisoner -I was called into a house where there were some Irish, and received a cut on my head; but I had no piece of work with his mother.
JURY. Q. Have you any means of knowing they were together? A. They were talking together before it was taken.

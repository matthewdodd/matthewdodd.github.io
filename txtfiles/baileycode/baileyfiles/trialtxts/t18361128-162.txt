JOHN ASHFORD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of December
1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



James Baker, from his person.







JAMES BAKER
. I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. On the afternoon of the 1st of December I was in Long-acre, and went to the Piazza, Covent-garden—I was looking at some cloth there, when a witness told me my handkerchief was taken, and the prisoner was pointed out—I immediately pursued him—he went under the arch to the centre of the market, and round to the right again—I did not get my handkerchief again—I did not observe other people about—I had used my hadkerchief within half an hour—it was a red one with, I think, a yellow border, with "J. B." on it.





ABRAHAM FANE
. I live in Raven-row, Mile-end and am a labourer. I was in Long-acre, and saw the prisoner—he pulled the handkerchief partly out of the prosecutor's pocket, and looked at it, and put it in again—the prosecutor went on and looked at some cloth, and then the prisoner took it quite out—I told the gentleman—we both pursued him to the middle arch of the market, he turned to the right, and then to the right again, before he was taken—he might have thrown the handkerchief away—I did not see it—he did not run, I believe, till the gentleman called, "Stop thief"—I pursued him closely—he ran two or three minutes, and had a full opportunity of throwing it away—it was a red colour, and apperd like a silk one—I told the prosecutor it was a red one when he found it was gone.





JAMES STACE
. I am a constable of Covent Garden Market. I saw the prisoner running, and just as I stopped him Fane go to him—I searched him, but did not find the handkerchief that was described—I found a blue one upon him that he could give no account of—he ran in my sight for about twenty yards—in crossing the gangs the market he had an opportunity of throwing any thing away.

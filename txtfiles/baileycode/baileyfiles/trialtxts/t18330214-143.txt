            . I am a constable of Cripplegate. On the evening of the 8th of January I was passing Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner with this cask on his shoulder - he turned into Fountain-court; I then asked him what he had got, and where he got it - he threw it down, and ran away; I pursued him, raised a cry of Stop thief! and he was taken in Aldermanbury.

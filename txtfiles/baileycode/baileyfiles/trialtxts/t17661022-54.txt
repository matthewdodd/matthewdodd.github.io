; last Saturday, between two and three o'clock, the two prisoners came to my shop, while we were up at dinner; I was called down; I heard a dispute between my maid-servant and the prisoners; the maid said Dowle had stole a bunch of garnets, and put them in her bosom; I found them on the counter; the prisoners begged to be let go;

             desired I would give Dowle a drubbing, and let her go about her business; I sent for a constable, and took them both to Guildhall.

            . I am servant to Mr. Sterrop; last Saturday I was in the shop, the 2 prisoners came in, and talked to each other; Dowle, as she stepped over the threshold, took a bunch of garnets, and put them in her bosom; when the journeyman went behind the counter, I stepped forward and shut the street-door, and said, Madam, you have taken a bunch of garnets out of the window; she denied it; I said, I saw her put them into her bosom, then she took them out; the other prisoner said, Fie Polly, I thought you would not do such a naughty trick, and they laughed to each other; when master came down they begged for mercy.
Dowle's defence.
We were coming home from Billingsgate; Hinckley went in to buy a new ribbon; I saw a heap of garnets in the window; I took some, and put them about my neck, and said, how do these look; she said, very well; the maid said, I was going to steal them.
Hinckley's Defence.
I met this young woman, and asked her to go along with me home; we went to buy a ribbon for me; the maid rang the bell, and called her master, and accused Dowle with stealing a necklace; I saw it in her hand; she put her hand in her bosom, I saw none there; I looked on the counter, and there they were.

JOHN CLEMENT. I am gate-keeper at the London-docks


. On the 7th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate - he appeared bulky; I went, and laid hold of him - I asked what he had; he said, "I have nothing about me," but I found round his legs and body this wool - I asked where he got it; he said outside the dock, and that he went up a court to stow it about him - he afterwards said he got it at the east quay of the dock, and that he was led to do it by 
               
                  Charles 
                  Stewart
               



             - I went to that quay, and saw a bale of wool which had been cut open, and some taken out of it; I produce a sample of the wool taken from the bale, and this found on the prisoner appears to correspond with it in every respect - I have a slight recollection of the prisoner; he has worked as an extra labourer
 there.
JOHN BRUNICK. I took the weight of the bag of wool; it was 4 cwt. 1 qr. 16lbs., and the next morning, from what Clement said, I weighed it again; it was 12lbs. short- it was the property of the London-dock Company; here is the Act which incorporates the Company - I have seen the prisoner working there.
Prisoner's Defence. It was given to me to put into a pillow-case, as I was going to sea.

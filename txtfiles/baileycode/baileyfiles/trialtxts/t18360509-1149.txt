THOMAS FREDERICK CASTOR
. I live with Mr. John Nelson, of the Bull Inn, Aldgate. I drive his cart—I was at the Ram Inn, at Smithfield, on the 14th of April, getting a parcel signed, which was to go further into the country—I had the parcel with me, which Mr. Nelson had to send out from his inn—I went into the booking-office—I left my cart and parcels in it, standing opposite the gateway—it was in my sight—I looked round, and saw the prisoner take a parcel out of the cart, and put it into his smock-frock—he got down and ran away with it—I ran and caught him, and brought him back—it contained linen shirts and dickies—they belong to a young man named James Andrews—I was going to take them to him.

Prisoner. A gentleman asked me to carry them to Goswell-street, and said be would give me sixpence—I was not near the cart. Witness. I saw him get down off the cart with the parcel in his smock-frock—when I caught him he asked me to let him go—he was not going the road to Goswell-street.





GEORGE CRAWLEY
. (City police-constable, 61.) I took the prisoner, and have the shirts—they were not found on him.

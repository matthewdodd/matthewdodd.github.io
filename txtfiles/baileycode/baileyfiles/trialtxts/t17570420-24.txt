            . I live in a court in Beech lane. On the 24th of March I lost a two dollar piece of Sweeden, and a four dollar piece of Sweeden, nine pound odd ounces, value better than nine shillings. I suspected the prisoner, by reason I had missed a piece before, and I missed it from the place where it was put; after he had been in it. I went in, from a mistrust, the other being lost. I sent my servant after him. He had the piece of copper on him at that time. I then charged him with the other, and he own'd to the taking it; I had seen it a quarter of an hour before.

            . The prisoner Hall came to my master to borrow a basket. He pull'd the door to where the basket was, and never brought the key. Master went in and missed the copper. He sent me after him, and I brought him back with it.

I had no design to take the copper away; it was in the basket. I was coming back with it.
Brooks. He was going forwards with the basket over his head, and the copper under his coat.

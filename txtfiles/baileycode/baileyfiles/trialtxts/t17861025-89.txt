                   CLARKE
               



             sworn.
I am a hemp dresser, and servant to the prosecutor; I found this hemp at 
               
                  Thomas
                   Brown
               



            's who was spinning it; I charged him with having taken it; he said, if it was lost, his brother bought it; that was John Brown; and he said, he stole the goods, and he hoped Mr. Bond would forgive him; that was in Mr. Bond's shop; I heard no promise made him.
PRISONER THOMAS'S DEFENCE.
He was working some of it; it was in a shed; I knew it was my master's; I know nothing of the taking it.
PRISONER JOHN'S DEFENCE.
I was very much in liquor; and he told me if I did not say I did it, he would have me hung, and take me to Newgate; and so by his over persuading me, and promising me, I said, I did it.

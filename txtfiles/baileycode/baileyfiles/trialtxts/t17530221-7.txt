            . On the third of February I was going from the Ship tavern, Bishopsgate-street


, to my own house in Spitalfields


, there were two ladies, I went to give them the wall that they might pass by, I turned my coat aside, I felt something at my pocket, I took hold of the prisoner's hand, at the same time there were two women with him, who tried to catch at his pocket; then I shifted him out of my right hand into my left, and with my stick kept the women off; then I went to pull him into the Helmet alehouse, and saw him drop something, which was taken up. and appeared to be my handkerchief, and another which I have here. (Both produced in court, and one of them deposed to, marked N. S.) The person that took them up is the next evidence.

             . I saw the prisoner drop these two handkerchiefs down at the Helmet in Bishopsgate street, I took them up, and the prosecutor owned to the silk one. Mr. Shepherd had hold on the prisoner at the same time.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming along and the gentleman took hold on me, and said I had picked his pocket of a handkerchief; he said there was no name upon his handkerchief.
Shepherd. I never said so; I said to the last witness mine is a brown handkerchief, and there is N. S. upon it before he shewed it me.

1923. 




THOMAS BOWLER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of June, 2 pairs of shoes, value 5s., the goods of 



John Perkins.






JOHN PERKINS
. I live in Field-lane. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me—on the 12th of June I lost a pair of my wife's boots, and a pair my own—these are them—they are called high-lows, or shoes—I saw them the night before, when I went to bed.





ELLEN BARRY
. I live in Field-lane. On the 12th of June I saw the prisoner at the pawnbroker's, offering some boots there for 3s.—I told the pawnbroker to detain the boots, as I thought I knew them—I fetched the prosecutor's wife, and while I was gone the prisoner went away.

Prisoner. I am quite positive I was not in the shop. Witness. I am sure it was you—these are the boots he offered—I took very great notice of them, from the toes to the heels, when I had seen the prosecutor's wife wear them for about ten days.





WILLIAM LEE
. I slept in the next bed to the prisoner, at the lodging in Fieid-lane—I saw him on the Wednesday morning after this in Newgate-street—he had a pair of boots on his feet—I gave information to the officer who took him.





BOHLE HARME
 (City police-constable. No. 288.) I stopped the prisoner in Newgate-street, about eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 14th—he had these shoes on his feet.





JOHN PERKINS

re-examined. These shoes, found on the prisoner's feet, are mine.

Prisoner's Defence. I purchased the shoes on my feet. I did not offer the others to pawn.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

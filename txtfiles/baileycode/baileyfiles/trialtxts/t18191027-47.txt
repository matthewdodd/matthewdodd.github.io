            . I live in Cowper's-court, Cornhill. On the 12th of October, about a quarter after twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Lower Thames-street


, and felt myself hustled by two boys bigger than the prisoner, one on each side - the prisoner was behind them. As soon as I turned round, the other two ran down Botolph wharf. I found the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, secured him, and gave him in custody at the Mansion House.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. There was a parcel of boys before me; the gentleman turned round, and they ran away. Hestruck me, and said,
"Look at the handkerchief at your feet." He did not take it out of my hand.

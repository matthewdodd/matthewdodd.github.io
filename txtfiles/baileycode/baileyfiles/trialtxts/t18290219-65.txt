            . I am a boot-maker - my father, Alexander Wilson, keeps a shop
, on Holborn-hill


. On the 12th of February this boot hung on the door-post; I saw it safe five minutes before it was taken - a little girl came in and gave information, between six and seven o'clock; I sent one of our men out, and the prisoner was brought back by Holland, who produced the boot, which I am certain was my father's.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner at the corner of Field-lane; I had been watching him for an hour, and saw him take this boot from the door-post - I laid hold of him, and took it from under his coat, with the shop-ticket on it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He felt my trousers down, to see if I had it, and if he saw me take it he would know where to find it; I kicked against it on Holborn-hill, and picked it up, looked round, and could see nobody to own it.

2957. 




EDWARD SMITH
 was indicted for

 stealing, on the 
24th of September, 6 1/2 oz. weight of tobacco, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



Sarah Riddle; and that he had been before convicted of felony: and 




JAMES GOLDSTON



, for feloniously receiving the same, well knowing it to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.






SARAH RIDDLE
. I am single, and keep a shop in Margtret-street, Limehouse-fields—Smith came there, on the 24th of September, for some tobacco—while I was turning about for a match, he took half-a-pouud of tobacco out of a jar, and ran off—I am quite sure he is the man.





ELIZA PRATT
. I was in the prosecutor's shop, and saw Smith come and take the tobacco from the jar, put it into his hat, and run off.





PHILIP PRATT
. From what I heard I went into a public-house—I saw the two prisoners there—I said to Smith, "I want the tobacco which you have taken from Mrs. Riddle's, opposite"—I cannot say whether Goldston was near enough to hear this—I saw Smith put the tobacco out of his own hat into Goldston's—I then went to Goldston, took the tobacco out of the hat, and called for a policeman.





JAMES HANLY
 (police-constable K 138.) I was called, and attempted to take the prisoners—they struggled and fought with me.





MART ANN HEBDEN
. I keep the Bricklayers' Arms, whew the prisoners were found—Smith was not drunk that I know of.

Smith's Defence. We were both tipsy.





GEORGE SWADEN
 (police-constable K 92.) I produce a certificate of Smith's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.

            , who is a chimney-sweeper
, and lives in Duke's-place, Chelsea


. On the 25th of October, about weleven o'clock in the morning, my child was playing in the court - I missed her soon after, and went in search, but could not find her. I received information, and found the prisoner with my child at the Royal Hospital public-house-it had two songs in its hand-the prisoner also had songs. I said, "You wretch, what do you do with my child?" - She made no answer. The constable took her. She had not done any thing to it. I never saw her before. She was a mile from my house.
THOMAS CHITTLE. I am a waterman, and live at Chelsea. I saw the child with its father between eleven and twelve o'clock. About a quarter of an hour afterwards, I heard it was lost. I went home to dinner-after that, I saw its father searching the privy for it. I heard of the child from a young woman, went in search of it, and found the prisoner leading it down by College-walk. I got a constable, returned, and found her with it at the Royal Hospital public-house-it had two songs, in its hand; she had hold of its hand. This was an hour after it had been lost.

            . On the 25th of October, I was at work - I go out ironing. As I returned from dinner, I went into the Royal Hospital public-house to get some beer, and saw the prisoner come in with the child, offering her songs for sale. I gave the child a halfpenny, seeing the woman in distress. The child went towards the door, the prisoner called her back, took it from her, and took the child up-in a few minutes the mother came in, and said, "You wretch! what do you do with my child?" and fainted away. The constable took the prisoner into custody.
Prisoner's Defence. I found the child at the top of Church-lane. I am innocent.
MARY PEARCE. I saw her bring the child in - She did not inquire any thing about it.

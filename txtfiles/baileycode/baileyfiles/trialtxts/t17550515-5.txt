James Green. As I was coming down Fleet-street


 about two in the afternoon on the 25th of April, I felt something at my pocket, I put my hand into it and missed my handkerchief, and saw the prisoner in the King's-head passage putting such a blue and white handkerchief as mine in his breeches, he ran away, I called out, stop him, stop him, he was pursued and taken, and searched, but had got rid of the handkerchief; we took a companion of his about half an hour after; he had five handkerchiefs about him, but neither of them mine.

            . I saw the prisoner take a linen handkerchief out of the pocket of Mr. Green, as I was standing at my own door; I saw him put his hand in his pocket twice, the second time he pulled it out, it was blue and white, he ran up the King's-head passage, and I up Chancery-lane to meet him as he came out; I was at the taking him, and searched him, he had not the handkerchief then; about half an hour after I took a companion of his whom I had seen walking with him; I found five handkerchiefs upon him, but neither of them the prosecutor's.
Prisoner's defence.
I was putting my shirt into my breeches, and they said it was a handkerchief; I never had it.
To his character.

            . The prisoner was my apprentice, he lived with me about a year and half; he ran away from me for about six months. I do not know how he has lived.

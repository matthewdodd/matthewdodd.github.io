William Ive, from a certain dock adjacent to a certain navigable river, called the 
Thames.—2nd COUNT, stating it to be the goods of 



James Waddell and others.


MR. BODKIN
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM JOHN ALFRED IVE
. My father's name is William—he had a vessel in the dock under repair, belonging to Mr. James Waddell and Co.

—the old copper was being stripped off—I missed some of the copper—on the night of the 11th of June I watched, but no one came that night.





WILLIAM COLLINGS
 (police-sergeant R 13.) I produce some copper which I got from Mr. Wakden—he told me who he bought it of directly.





THOMAS WAKDEN
. I live in Flagon-row, Deptford, and deal in old metal. I bought that copper on Friday morning, the 11th of August, before ten o'clock—this first piece, which weighed 5l. bs., I bought of the two prisoners for 2s. 6d.—Ship came the second time and brought 6l. bs., for which I gave together, him 3s.—I gave it up to Collings.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (police-sergeant R 15.) I took the prisoner Ship into custody, after this copper had been found—I afterwards saw Giffin, and asked Ship if he had sold any copper, he said, "No"—I then took him to Wakden, and he said he did sell it, and had it from Griffin.





WILLIAM COATES
. I took Giffin—he said he did not sell any copper in Flagon-row—between three and four o'clock on the Friday morning, before this copper was stolen, I had seen the two prisoners with another person, not more than three minutes' walk from Mr. Ive's premises—I threatened to take them into custody, and they walked away then.

MR. IVE. This is part of the copper belonging to the vessel—there is a mark on it—the vessel was in the deck adjoining the Thames.

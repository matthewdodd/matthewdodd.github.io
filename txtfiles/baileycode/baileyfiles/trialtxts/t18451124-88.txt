ELIZABETH BARK
. 1 am the wife of Frederick William Bark. The prisoner was in my service—on the 5th of Nov. I missed all these articles—I sent for the policeman, and went to the second floor room, where the prisoner slept—I found there two boxes of clothes, one locked, the other unlocked—the policeman ordered the prisoner to open the locked one, and we found all these things in it—I consider them to be my husband's—they were bought in thestock of Mr. Morris—I am able to swear that—the prisoner said they were hers, and were not mine, but when the policeman opened the box, she said they were Mr. Morris's, and would we be merciful to her.

Prisoner. She said it was a pity my things should lie about, and she lent me a box; neither of them saw the things; I sent for the policeman.





ISAAC WAKEFIELD
 (police-constable, G 140.) The prosecutrix asked the prisoner to open her box—she did, and she said, "It is all yours, Mrs. Bark and Mrs. Morris, be merciful to me and forgive me," and she was for going down stairs.

Prisoner. I did not; she wanted me to open the box before the policeman came, and I would not.





MARY ANN MORRIS
. This is part of the property that was sold to Mr. Bark.

JURY. Q. Was there any quarrel between you and your husband? A. We had parted, but my things were to be forwarded to me, and were left with Mrs. Bark for me—my husband put no more confidence in the prisoner than in a common servant.





ELIZABETH BARK

re-examined. Q. You have seen these things that are laid as your husband's property—were they handed over to you and sold to you by Mr. Morris? A. They were, I am quite sure—I was with the prisoner in removing the parcels off the shelves—they were all in little bundles, and when my back was turned she took some, and put in her owu room—I saw her do it—I saw her rob me, but I did not know this business, and the prisoner was to assist and give me a knowledge of it.




GUILTY
. Aged 42.—


Transported for Seven Years


(There was another indictment against the prisoner, and she had been before transported.)

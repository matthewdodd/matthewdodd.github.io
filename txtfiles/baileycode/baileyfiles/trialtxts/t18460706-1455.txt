MICHAEL SWEENEY
 was indicted

 for stealing 31bs. weight of cigars, value 1l., the goods of 



Stephen Butcher Penn; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






FREDERICK PELLING
. I saw the prisoner running up Glasshouse-fields on the 27th of June—it was in the middle of the day—I do not know the time—I saw him drop four cigars—I took them up, and gave them to Mrs. Penn.





ELIZA OCKELFORD
. I live with Mr. Stephen Butcher Penn, at Stepney. On the 27th of June I saw the prisoner come into his shop, and take two bundles of cigars, and he went down Glasshouse-fields—I am sure he is the person.





GEORGE CARR
 (police-constable K 166.) I took the prisoner, and have these four cigars.





PEGGY PENN
. I am the wife of Stephen Butcher Penn. I missed four bundles of cigars—these four are like what I lost—when Petting brought back these four they were wet.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about them.





JOHN BOLTON
 (police-constable K 285.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 26th Avg,. 1845, and confined three months)—he is the person.

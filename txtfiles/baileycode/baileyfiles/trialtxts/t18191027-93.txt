            . I am a butcher
, and live on Harrow-road, Paddington


. On the 5th of October, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners and two others passed my door, they all stopped. French took a piece of beef off the hook, and gave it to another, whom we have not caught, and all ran away together - I followed; the other dropped the meat, he was caught, but got away; I caught the prisoners. I had caught Richards attempting to take some once before.

            , I was a gentleman's servant, but have been out of place a long time. French was going by the shop, and said it was a good speck, and he would have a piece of beef; I was with them; there were four of us together. I said I would have no concern in it. French immediately took the beef, and gave it to the boy who is not taken.

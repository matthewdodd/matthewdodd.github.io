WILLIAM JACKSON,



 GEORGE CARTER
, and 




GEORGE HALL
, were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
29th of November, 2 casks, value 20s., the goods of 



Samuel Beale; and that George Carter had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL BEALE
. I live at No. 7, Chichester-place, Gray's Inn-lane, and am a cooper. On the 28th of November I had two casks safe, en closed in my garden, in Manchester-street, near to where I live—I missed them on the Sunday following, the 3rd of December—I believe these are my casks—(looking at two.)

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How late on the 28th had you seen them? A. I am not positive to an hour, but I believe from three to four o'clock in the afternoon—it might have been rather sooner—there is a mark on them—I have no doubt about them—I do not know Trafalgar square—I have no other name but Samuel Beale—these are my property.





CHARLES ADCOCK
 (police-constable A 44.) At half-past seven o'clock, on the morning of Wednesday, the 29th of November, I saw the three prisoners coming down Trafalgar-square, Jackson and Carter were rolling the casks, and Hall was carrying two hoops in his hand—I followed them till I met another policeman—then I went to them, and asked where they were going—Jackson said, "I am going to sell them; I deal in them"—I asked him where he got them from—he said he bought them of a person named Jones, living in Kensington—I took them all.





PETER KENDALL
 (police-sergeant P 1.) I got this certificate of Carter's former conviction from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner Carter is the man.
(William Allen, of Camden-street, Walworth, gave the prisoner Jackson a good character.)

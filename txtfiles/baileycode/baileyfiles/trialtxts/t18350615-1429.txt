MARY EMMA BUSS
. The prisoner was my servant—I searched her box, and found all these things, except this band, which she had on her person—she said nothing—I bad missed these things that day.





JOHM M'GILL
 (police-constable E 29.) I was called in—the prisoner opened her box, and these things were found in it.

Prisoner. The things were in a small trunk belonging to my mistress. Mrs. Buss. The box was not mine—she opened it with a key—it was in her bed-room, which was locked—she had been out, and had a cloth cloak on—I cannot tell what boxes she had when she came, as it was late—when I got the officer, and said "I should like to have her box searched"—she said "Very well"—she unlocked the door, and went in, and opened the boxes herself—there was one little paper trunk, which she said was not hers, but only this scarf was found in that.

Prisoner. Out of the thirteen books there, six of them are my own—this cookery book, and this jest book, and some others are mine—this one was given me by a young man named William Carter.

MRS. BUSS. This book has not my husband's name in it, but he says it is his—my books have all got my name in them.

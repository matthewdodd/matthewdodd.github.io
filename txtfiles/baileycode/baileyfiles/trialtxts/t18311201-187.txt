, and am a shoemaker
. This is my shoe; I was not at home when it was lost.

            . I live opposite the prosecutor. I knew he had lost two pairs of shoes on the 12th of November, and in about an hour afterwards (about nine o'clock) I saw the three prisoners go to his shop, and look in at the window - McClew put his hand in at a pane of glass, which had been broken the same evening, by the persons who stole the other shoes; he took this one shoe out, and was in the act of taking another - I ran out, and took him and Denham; the other ran off, but was pursued and taken.

            . I am an officer. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and Ewling, who was running, was stopped and given to me.

            . On the 8th of November I met the prisoner in Mary-le-bone-street


; she appeared distressed, and begged a few halfpence - I gave her twopence, walked a few paces, and asked what she was going to do with it - she said, to take a glass of gin. I said, "I will go with you," thinking I would watch her, to see the object I had been relieving. She took me round the corner to a public-house door, gave my waistcoat a pull down, and took this money out of my waistcoat pocket. I seized her hand with the money in it, and held it till the watchman came up.

            . I am a watchman. I was called at twelve o'clock at night, and found Eades holding the prisoner's hand with this money in it. She swore she would not deliver it up. I took it from her.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house with this money, and said the prosecutor gave it her by mistake instead of halfpence.
Prisoner's Defence. He gave it to me to oblige him.
PROSECUTOR. I had nothing to do with her.

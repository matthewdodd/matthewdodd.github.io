ANN MARIN SYMONS
. I am the wife of Edward Symons, who keeps a public-house, in York-street. On the 27th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the house—he appeared to be drunk—he wanted some beer—I was up-stairs at the time—I came

down and found him there—I thought him tipsy, and I took the beer from him which my servant had served him with, and he went away—I directly missed two towels—I went after him and told the officer about it—I went home, the officer sent for me in two minutes, and I saw him find two towels in the prisoner's coat-pocket, which he had taken from a cupboard in the tap-room.





WILLIAMS ALDERMAN
. If am a policeman. Mrs. Symons spoke to me—I overtook the prisoner who was drunk—I found the towels in his coatpocket—he was able to walk very well.
(properly produced and sworn to.)





THOMAS WATKINS
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the clerk of the peace of Surrey (read)—I was a witness against him—he is the man.




GUILTY

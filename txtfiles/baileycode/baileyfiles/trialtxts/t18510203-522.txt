EDWARD JAMES WEBB
. I am an inmate of St. Luke's, Chelsea, workhouse. On 18th Jan., at twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was employed to collect the men to go to the stone-yard; the prisoner was one of them; and while there Wilkie came, and in the prisoner's hearing said, "stop the men from going out, there is a pair of sheets stolen"—the prisoner, who was about four yards off, immediately turned away, and went towards another part of the house—I noticed a bulk about his body, followed him to the privy, and got up in time to see him throw the sheets on the roof—he got away over the walls into the street—these are the sheets (produced)—they have the workhouse mark on them—I saw them in the prisoner's hand as he threw them.





MARY WILKIE
. I am an inmate of Chelsea Workhouse, and have the care of the young men's ward, where the prisoner occupied a bed. On the night before 18th Jan. he slept in the upper room, and in the morning, about eight o'clock, I missed a pair of sheets—I gave information—these are them.





DANIEL SUTTON
. I am the master of the workhouse—these sheets are the property of the Guardians of the Poor of St. Luke, Chelsea.

Prisoner, Q. Have I got any bad character in the house? A. Yes; you have been a very bad boy ever since I have known you.





EDWARD LYNE
 (policeman, V 210.) I took the prisoner—he said he ran away from the workhouse, but he did not steal the sheets—I produce a certificate—(read—Central Criminal Court—John Reason, Convicted Feb. 1849, having been before convicted, Confined one year)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.

I live the corner of Catherine-street


; on Monday evening last I lost a Bath stove, it was the outside of the door fastened with a chain and padlock; a man opened the shop door and said a man had taken the grate away from the door, immediately my servant ran out after him, and caught him and brought him to the shop, the man went down on his knees; I saw the stove half an hour before it was stolen, I was behind the counter, and a man came and told me a stove was stolen.

I followed the man immediately and overtook him with that very grate on his shoulder.

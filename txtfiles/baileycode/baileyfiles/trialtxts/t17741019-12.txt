            , in Coventry street, when she was robbed; the prisoner tore the hat from her head, and ran away; we ran after him immediately; he had the hat in his hand when we overtook him in Leicester-fields; the watchman went to stop him, and he threw it away; he turned again and tore her hair.

            . I am a watchman; I took the prisoner in custody; he said if I would let him out he would shew where he dropped the hat; I would not; I went back with the young woman, and just where I stopped him I found the hat.
The prisoner in his defence denied the charge.

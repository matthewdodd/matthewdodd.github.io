John Bates. The prisoner was at work with me at Buckingham-Gardens


 at a building on the 16th of May last. I lost 10 s. in money from out of a box in my room. I had a suspicion of the prisoner and took him up.
Q. Had you your money again?
Bates. No, I had not.
Q. When did you take him up?
Bates. I lost my money on the Sunday, and on Monday morning I took him up. I have witness here that heard him confess, but I did not.

            . When my husband was gone out of the room, the prisoner confessed he took the 10 s. out of a box in my room, and that he had paid 5 s. for lodging and washing, and the other 5 s. he gave to his mother.

            . The prosecutor desired me to assist in taking the prisoner to justice Carkafs's which I did. There the prisoner confessed he took the money. The justice asked what he had done with it, he said he had paid 5 s. for washing and lodging, and the other 5 s. he gave his mother.
Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of what is laid to my charge.

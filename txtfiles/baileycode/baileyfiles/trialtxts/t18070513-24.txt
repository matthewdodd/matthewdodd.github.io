Q. How long did you know the prisoner before he married your daughter. - A. He paid his addresses to her for a long time, I believe more than a year. I kept my girl from him seven months, I believe, because she was so young.
Court. What age was she when she married him. A. Eighteen.
Mr. Knapp. Did the prisoner state what line of life he was in. - A. He has been after many things. The money he has had of me is to the amount of two hundred pounds.

Q. Do not you know that he has behaved well to your daughter. - A. He has not behaved well, but very ill.
Prisoner. The daughter that she said was in the country, is in the prison now.
Q. (to witness) Does your daughter live with him. A. She has been backwards and forwards to him.

Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Parkinson has known my family for twenty years. In the year 1804, I became acquainted with her daughter, at which time I was a mathematical instrument maker
. I have not been capable of following it, owing to a complaint in my head. After she had put her husband in a private mad house, where he remained thirteen months, she permitted her daughter to sleep with me; in one of my mad fits I slept with her daughter; she was to give me seven hundred pounds to buy a commission in the horse-guards; she promised me two hundred pounds; thirty-three pounds I returned her back; nine pound I paid for a gin score.
Court. Do you assert that ever you have been deranged in your mind. - A. Yes, from a nervous complaint in my head. At this time twelvemonth I had a letter from Mrs. Parkinson; she there speaks highly of my character; and adds, that she would protect me for the honour I had done to her daughter in marrying her.
Court. I called on you for your defence.
Prisoner. Mrs. Parkinson by a drunken habit swore her life against me.
Court. It is unbecoming you to throw any implication on Mrs. Parkinson's character. I want you to say something in your own defence.
Prisoner. The infamy of the mother has forced me to do what I have done; she has been infamous enough to take the duplicate of a watch from me; she swore her life against her daughter, and detained her in Tothill-fields. As for the two hundred pounds she said I had, every farthing was laid out in the repair of her mother's house, except forty pounds.

               Transported for Seven Years

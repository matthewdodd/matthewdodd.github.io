I stopped my coach at the gate of the Cross Keys, Wood-street


, the 22d of June, between two and three in the morning, I let out a passenger, when I returned to my box, I saw man get down from the forewheel with a box in his hand, I tried to stop him, he dropped a box, and run down Wood-street into Cheapside, I took up the box, it was a square deal box, I put it into the warehouse; it was directed to - White Esq; Lincoln's-inn. The prisoner was brought back to me by the porter and a watchman; I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot positively swear to him.
Prisoner's counsel. You remained by this coach all the while? - Yes.
You had very little opportunity of seeing any thing of him? - No, only by his dress, he was in black.
You did not see his face? - No.
There was nothing more that struck you than the dress of the man, which was black, you say now it was in June, when every body was in mourning? - Yes I believed it to be him when he was brought back again.
That was sometime after he made his first escape? - It might be about ten minutes, and all that time I never was from my coach.
Do you remain in the same service now? - Yes.
Have you ever been robbed before? - No. Sir.
WILLIAM NEGUS sworn.
I pursued the prisoner from the coach to Cheapside, I am the porter, I did not see him drop the box, the coachman shewed him me, and bid me follow him; he was taken in Gutter-lane, I only lost sight of him as he turned into Gutter-lane; the prisoner is the man to the best of my knowledge, I have no doubt of it.
Prisoner's counsel. How came you not to attend some of the examinations about this man? - I was not called upon.
You know he was examined twice before my Lord Mayor, and this evidence was not heard of? - I was not called upon.

Court. Was any body before him? - There was not a person in the street, the length of my beat, I came up to him, and told him I would knock him down if he did not stop, I pursued him to the end of Gutter-lane, he had like to run over the post, he was taken in Gutter-lane; we took him to the coachman, who swore he was the man.

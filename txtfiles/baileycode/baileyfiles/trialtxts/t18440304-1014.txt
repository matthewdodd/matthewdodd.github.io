JAMES BAILEY

 for stealing 371/2lbs. weight of lead, value 6s., the goods of

WILLIAM SAVILLE
. I am a plumber in the employ of Mr. William Henry Whittle. I believe these cuttings of lead, which are here, to be part of those which were on Mr. Whittle's premises on the 6th of Feb., and they are his property.





DANIEL HUTCHINGS
. I was at work outside Mr. Whittle's premises on the 6th of Feb.—the prisoner came and asked if the painting of the house was let—I said I did not know, but I referred him to Mr. Whittle—the prisoner helped his brother in with two gutters, about sixty or seventy yards form where I was at work—he then came again between four and five, and asked me for a basket.





JOHN WHITE
 (Police-constable R 180.) On the 6th of Feb. I saw the Prisoner, about seven o'clock in the evening, with a basket on his shoulder—I followed him to a marine-store shop—I asked him what he had got—he said some old lead—I found these cuttings in the basket—he said he had contracted for a job, and this was the old lead he took off, to put down new—he did not say where it was.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (police-sergeant R 15.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner in the man.




GUILTY
.** Aged 33.—


Transported for seven Years.

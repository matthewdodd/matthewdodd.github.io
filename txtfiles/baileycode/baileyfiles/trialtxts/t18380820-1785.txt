for embezzlement.






STEPHEN SWEET
. I live in Chancery-lane, and am a bookseller. The prisoner was in my employ—he was empowered to receive money, and ought to have paid it upon the same day-if he received 15s. 3d. and 9s. 3d. on the 30th of September, and the 4th of December, he has not paid them.





HENRY JOHNSON
. I live in Greenhill-place, Clerkenwell. On the 4th of December I paid the prisoner 9s. 3d. for his master.





JOHN CROFT
. I live in King's-rains-yard, Coleman-street. On the 30th of September, 1837, I paid 15s. 3d. to a person who had been in the employ-of the prosecutor—I cannot say it was the prisoner—he gave me this receipt.





STEPHEN SWEET

re-examined. This is the prisoner's hand-writing to this receipt—he never paid me either of these sums—I lost sight of him for half a year.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.
The prosecutor stated his loss to be above 30l.

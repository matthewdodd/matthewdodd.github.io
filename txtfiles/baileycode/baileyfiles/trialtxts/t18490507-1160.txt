WILLIAM LANGLEY
 I am master of the Priscilla, of Greenhithe. On 9th May I was in Thames-street, and went home with the prisoner—I sat in

her room smoking, an hour or an hour and a half—I had my money safe then—I asked for a bed, as I was rather in liquor—I did not undress, I missed my purse, with Vdl. 13l. 10s. in it, and a—only the prisoner was in the room—I sent for the landlady—the prisoner was gone then—she went after her.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me the purse, and say all the money you had in it was 4s.6d.? A. No.





MARY ANN ETHERINGTON
 I am servant at this house—the prisoner came down that night and said, "I can't make any good of him; I won't spend my night with him."





MART DAMERELL
 I searched the prisoner at the station—she said she had no pocket, nor any money—I found 3s. 6d. and 1d. in her glove—I asked her to take her dress off—she put her band in her bosom, and flung something under a seat—I went and found this purse with twelve sovereigns in it—she said, "There is his purse and his money, he may transport me if he likes."

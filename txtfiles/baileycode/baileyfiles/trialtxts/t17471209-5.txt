            . I live in Lemon-street, Goodman's-fields


; I am a cloth scourer. On saturday the 24th of October I had in my shop a dozen coats to scour, and this man enter'd my shop and stole these cloaths; they are the property of 
               
                  George

            , who is a salesman
, at the three Black-Lions, the corner of White-Lion-street. This young woman lives opposite to my house, and she saw the prisoner take them away.

            . I live opposite Mr. Stone's, and I saw the prisoner and another about the street, I had a suspicion of him: I saw him go into Mr. Stone's, and he brought three coats on his arm, and dropt one before he came out of the house; when I called to him and pursued him, he dropt the coats upon the step of an empty house: Mrs. Stone sent her boy to take up the coats, the mean time she lay'd hold of the prisoner, and carried him into her own house; he was lurking about the street an hour and a half before he did the fact.



                  George 
                  Creed 
               



             I am a salesman, and these two coats are mine; Mr. Stone fetcht them himself from my house to scour.



               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

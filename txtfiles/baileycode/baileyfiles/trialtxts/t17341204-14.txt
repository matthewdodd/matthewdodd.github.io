            . The 2 Prisoners came into our Shop and asked to see some printed Linnen. I shewed 'em several Pieces, and they were extreme difficult, which made me suspect 'em. I saw Eleanor take hold of one Piece, and draw it gently till it fell off the Counter; upon which I turn'd about to the Shelves on purpose to give her an Opportunity of taking it up. But however I perceived her to stoop down close to the other Prisoner. I turn'd again to the Counter, she bid me 11 d. for half a Yard. I told her I could not take it, and so they both went just without the Door, when I pull'd 'em back, and Eleanor drop'd this Piece of printed Linnen from under her Petticoats.
Servant. I saw Eleanor drop the Piece just as my Master turn'd them both in.
The Jury 

               acquitted
             Rachel, and found Eleanor 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

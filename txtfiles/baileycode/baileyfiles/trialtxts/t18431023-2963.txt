WILLIAM ALFRED HANSHAW
. I keep a greengrocer's shop in Tyndal-place, Gray's Inn-road. About ten o'clock in the evening of the 21st of Sept. my house was shut up—between twelve and one I was called up by Portsmouth—he had detained a servant of mine who had slept in the house, and the prisoner, together with a sack containing these vegetables—they are mine, to the best of my belief—I had such things—the bill against my servant was thrown out.





GEORGE PORTSMOUTH
 (police-constable E 117.) I was on duty between twelve and one o'clock—I saw the prisoner with a sack on his shoulder, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, "Two cabbages, and five bundles of wood"—I asked where he got them—he said, "From George Webb, at Mr. Hanshaw's—I went back, knocked, and asked Webb if he had sold any thing—he said, "Yes, 6d. worth of potatoes"—I called up Mr. Hanshaw, and in the sack found the whole of this property.

Prisoner's Defence. On that evening I went to Mr. Hanshaw's, and bought the things; the policeman took me back; Webb said I had bought the things, and there was the money; Mr. Hanshaw said he believed them to be his, and owned the sack; next morning he said the sack was not his.





RICHARD MOORE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

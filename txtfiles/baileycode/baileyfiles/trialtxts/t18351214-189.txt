JAMES WEDDELL BRIDGE
. About seven o'clock in the evening of the the of November, I was passing through Fenchurch-street, where I am inside with these tools under his arm—he was quite a stranger, and had no right there—I asked what business he had there—he said had come for William Jones' tools—I said I had no such person in my employ—he came out with the tools under his arm—I walked with him to Mr. Brown's the next house, and pushed him in three—these are the tools.





JOHN BRYANT

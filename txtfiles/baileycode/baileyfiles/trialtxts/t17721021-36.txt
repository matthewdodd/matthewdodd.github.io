            . I am a constable of Farringdon-within. About eight or nine in the evening of the 8th instant, going through St. Paul's Church Yard, near the Goose and Grid-iron, I saw the two prisoners and Aldridge laughing together; I looked at them and saw Aldridge emptying his pocket; he was giving the things to Connell; I went up and took hold of them: I took the things mentioned in the indictment out of Connell's pocket.

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoners about a month; they used to accompany me; we had been out all the day; we took these handkerchiefs that day: we have been out together upon this business a good many times; we picked a man's pocket in Rag-fair of the razors and razor case.
The prisoners, in their defence, said, they knew nothing of the matter.
Both

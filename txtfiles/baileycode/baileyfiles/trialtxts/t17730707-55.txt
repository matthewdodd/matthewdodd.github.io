            . The prisoner had formerly lived servant
 with me. I know nothing of the fact myself.
- Wishwell. I saw Mr. Hobbs's boy pitch his basket at the corner of Kirby-street


; I saw the prisoner look into it; then he put it on his shoulder and ran away.
Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner?
Wishwell. Yes, I knew him before when he lived with Mr. Hobbs, and am certain to him.
Mr. Hobbs's boy. I pitched the basket in that manner; the contents of it were the bread charged in the indictment.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take the bread; I have witnesses to prove myself at another place, but they are not here.

                  John

s at the corner of Lime-street


.
Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. I saw him on the 10th of April; he called at our shop; he brought me a written note; he said he brought it from Mrs. Porter of Ealing; I understood him to mean the wife of 
               
                  Charles 
                  Porter
               



            , a customer of ours at Ealing.
MR. SWIFT. I produce the note.
Hill. That is the note the prisoner delivered to me; he said his name was Thomas; he kept a light chaise cart, and that he carried parcels for Mrs. Porter. (The note read.) I delivered him three dozen cotton stocking accordings to that note and he took them away with him.
Q. Did you afterwards see him again - A. Not till the 24th, he was stopped on the 24th in consequence of information from the house of Luck and White; I saw him stopped at the house of Luck and White, on the 24th of April. I am certain he is the person that I delivered the stockings to on the 17th of April. As soon as he saw me enter the warehouse he said he received the stockings of me. We never got the stockings again.

            . I am one of the partners in the house of Swift and Luck. I took the prisoner in custody, in consequence of a message from Luck and White; I know nothing of the transaction.
Prisoner's Defence. I was led into the error; I was in a public-house in Whitechapel, a man said young man, are you of the mind to go of an errand for me, he gave me a note, told me to go with it to Messrs. Swift and Bell.

                  , on the 6th of September
, with intent feloniously and violently to steal from his person his monies
            .
TWO OTHER COUNTS, stating it to have been with menaces, and by force.
HENRY GALLABIN. On the 6th of September, about two o'clock in the day, I met the prisoner as I passed the end of lugram-court - he was waiting under the court; he came up to me, and asked me to give him 3s. - I said,"I've no money, and shall give you none;" I walked about the streets in a zig-zag direction, in order to find an officer - he followed me all the way, and exactly at half-past two o'clock I got to Bow church; he accompanied me all the way, and there he said, "I am not like some people - extorting sovereigns, I merely ask you for 3s.; you may as well give it me at once" - I said, "I shall not give you any thing;" when we got opposite Dolland's, in St. Paul's church-yard, he said, "Do you mean to give me the money?" I replied, "I will not give you any;" he said,"By G-d, I want the money, and if you don't give it me, by G-d you shall not darken those b-y gates again, so do as you like;" I am positive he used those expressions; I was in greater fear than ever then - he is a taller and much more powerful man than me; my mind was in a dreadful state, I hardly knew what I was about; I made my way to the corner of Bride-lane, saw an officer by Poppin's-court, and gave him in charge - I went to the watch-house; he came up close to me there, and said,"Don't do any thing; if you won't, by G-d I'll never trouble you again;" I instantly walked away from him -I am quite certain I never knew him before the 12th of August, 1830 - I was never in any public-house with him, nor ever drank in his company.
Prisoner. I have known him two years; I never asked him to give me any money - I asked him to lend it. Witness. The 12th of August was the first time I ever saw him- he did not ask the 3s. as a loan; I am sure he said if I did not give him 3s. I should never darken the gates again, and while he used that expression he held my left arm.

            . I am a City officer. On the 6th of September, a little before three o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge - I do not think he was near enough to hear what the prosecutor said - when I took him he said he only wanted to borrow the money, he afterwards said he only wanted the lend of it, and afterwards that he did not want to extort it - when I was taking him from the Compter to Guildhall I asked how long he had known the prosecutor - he said about seven or eight years; I am certain of that - he had heard the charge as I took him to the watch-house; what he stated at Guildhall was taken in writing.
Prisoner. Mr. Betterton must be mistaken in my telling him that time, because I did not know him so long; I have been acquainted with him more than two years.

            . I am positive he said so, as it was the only question I put to him.

JOHN SMITH
 and 




SARAH SMITH
 were indicted for

stealing on the 
4th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of a man unknown, from his person.






JAMES WILD
. I am a police-constable. I was at Greenwich fair on the 4th of April—I saw the prisoners there—they sounded almost every gentleman's pocket in the fair—I then saw them go behind a gentleman, and the man lifted the gentlemen's tail of his coat, and drew the corner of his handkerchief out—he then pushed the female prisoner behind the gentleman, and she took it—I seized her—she held open her hands and said, "I have got nothing"—I said, "That will not do for me"—I opened her shawl, and found this handkerchief—she threw herself on the ground, and began biting, and kicking, and scratching, and the male prisoner she wed great resistance to the other officer—they gave their names at the station-house

and the man said she was his wife—I called to the gentleman but he got away.





WILLIAM DYKES
 (police-constable R 193.) I saw the two prisoners together—the man took the handkerchief partly out, and then the woman took it, and put it under her arm—Wild took the female, and I took the man—they bit and found very much—we had to call three or four more to assist us—here are the marks on my hand where the woman bit me.

Sorah Smith's Defence. I did not speak to you at all before you cut me across the face with your staff.

John Smith's Defence. It was my own property—I gave it my wife ten minutes before I was taken.
(Sarah Ross, a book-folder, of George-street, Tower-hill, gave Sarah Smith a good character.)

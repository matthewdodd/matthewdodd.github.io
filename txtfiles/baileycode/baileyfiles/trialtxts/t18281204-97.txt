. The prisoner came to my mother's on the 2d of November, and said she wanted a cup of tea - she had her breakfast the next morning; I went to my mistress's returned in two hours, and found the prisoner asleep in my bed - she got up and went away. On the Monday morning I missed my shawl, and asked my mother, who could not tell me any thing about it - I met the prisoner on the 5th of November with an old handkerchief of my mother's in her hand; I went and asked her for it, and she gave it me; I went home, and told my father that I thought she must have my shawl - we went and took her; we asked her what she had done with it - she said she had sold it for 9d.

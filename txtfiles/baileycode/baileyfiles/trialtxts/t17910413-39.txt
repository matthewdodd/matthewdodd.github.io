             sworn.
I gave my watch to clean to Willian Beadle in Little Russel-street, Covent Garden, No. 33


; I received it from the woman of the house where it was stolen from, the watchmaker's, on the 26th of February; I gave it them on the 23d of February.


                  ELIZABETH
                   BEADLE
               



             sworn.
I am sister to the young man who had the watch to clean; I saw it taken out of the shop; I cannot tell what day of the month, but it was on a Saturday; the young man came into the shop, and told me my brother wanted a screw-driver, and not knowing the man I did not believe the story; immediately on this the prisoner pulled out the drawer at my brother's table, in which was a watch and a pair of silver cases beside; he took the watch up, I told him he had got a watch; he gave me a push from him and went out, and I gave an alarm, and in about ten minutes he was brought back; the prisoner was a stranger to me before that day, but I have no doubt but he is the same; the watch was likewise brought back by a person who picked it up in the street, whose name is 
               
                  Robert
                   Dove
               



            , and delivered it to me.
Is it the same watch delivered to you as was taken by the prisoner? - I do not know the watch.


                  WILLIAM
                   BEADLE
               



             sworn.
On Saturday, the 26th of February last, I was with Mr. Young, and coming to his house I saw a parcel of people at his door. When I went in I was told I had been robbed of a watch; my sister said, I have got the watch, she shewed me it immediately; I said, this is Mr. Young's watch which I had to repair: I had repaired the same watch for Mr. Young, about a year ago; the watch was delivered to Mr. Young in my presence, and Mr. Young produced it atSir Sampson Wright's office. I found the box and case much bruised, and the glass broke. The prisoner was taken to Bow-street that same night.
Where did you see the man when you came home? - In my sister's shop, in the same place where I work.
Can you tell me where the watch was before you went? - It was in my drawer, and there was another watch in the same drawer, separated, which I had not repaired.
What time did you go out? - About a quarter before six.
Are you sure that when you went out, that watch was in that drawer, and that the watch given you when you came home, was the same left in that drawer? - I will take my oath of it.
Was any body present in the shop that see this watch delivered to you? - Yes, the two witnesses, the man that took the prisoner, and the man that picked up the watch, were both in the shop at the same time.

                   JONES
               



             sworn.
I am one of Sir Sampson Wright's patrol; going out about six o'clock in the evening, and going up Russel-court, I heard the cry of stop thief; I turned my head and saw a number of people, and saw the prisoner running; I went after him and caught him, he was running through Russel-court; I enquired the reason of stop thief being called out; they said he had stole a watch; I took and searched him, and found nothing upon him; I took him to the house of Mrs. Beadle, and she said she had lost a watch, and I took him before Sir Sampson. In about five minutes after I was at Mrs. Beadle's, Mr. Dove brought the watch in. I am sure that is the man I stopped.
ROBER DOVE sworn.
I am a newsman; I picked the watch up about six o'clock in the evening, in Russel-passage, it laid out of its case; Russel-passage leads from Drury-lane to Bridges-street. I took the watch to the house, and gave it to Mrs. Beadle herself; I heard an alarm of stop thief; I saw people running.
Prisoner. Did not you see me and another man exactly running together? - I saw two men running, but I cannot tell who they were.
Court to Young. What was done with the watch after it was brought into the house? - It was given to Mrs. Beadle, and she gave it to me, and I have kept it from that time to this.
(The watch produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord and Gentlemen: I am to prove, as far as lies in my power, the villainy of this indictment. I had absented myself from my master's service, and I got into liquor; I accordingly repaired to the house of Mr. Sessons, the King's Arms in Great Russel-street, for a lodging; they could not give me one: I immediately repaired to the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



             in Bow-street, where I got a lodging. On Saturday morning I got up and called for three halfpenny worth of purl and gin; I sat down drinking it, and reading the paper, and the prosecutor came in, and asked me to let him see the paper when I was done, which I did: accordingly he told me I appeared to him very much like an honest man, and that he wanted a person to do an errand for him. He immediately told me he had a watch sent him to repair, by a person of the name of 
               
                  Sophia
                   Johnson
               



            , who lived in Duke's-head-court. He told me further, that he himself had great reason to believe, that this watch was stolen; and that if he could prove its being stolen, he meant to take the greatest act of justice, which lay in his hands to do. He said the watch wanted a gold basil, and a gold minute-hand; and that he wished me to go with a lie in my mouth to call at the house of this Sophia Johnson, and ask for her; I went there, and they told me she was out of town; I was to tell her that I was the son of the watchmaker, and that the man who was there repeatedly was only a journeyman. The people told meshe would not be in town till Monday; and on speaking to the woman about the watch, she said she knew 
               
                  Sophia
                   Johnson
               



             came honestly by it, and as such would be very much obliged to me, if I would not let that black looking thief come there any more, meaning Mr. Beadle. I went back to Mr. Beadle, and told him what was said; accordingly he took me to the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



            , and there was there two or three men of Sir Sampson's officers at the time we went in, I told them what I had been about; and they told me he had been repeatedly making an affair of this watch, and that he had got some fool or other to go there; for no wise man would take it up; at this place I called for another pint of beer; he took me from there to the Crown in Marybone-court, in the Strand, where he took me to a house, where we might find some common women, and there was two or three sailors; he immediately asked them if they knew the name of this person who had sent him this watch, and he told them they had sent it him by the name of 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Head
               



            ; they told him the name of the person was 
               
                  Sophia
                   Johnson
               



            ; we had two or three pints of beer there, I paid my share; I went from there with him to Mr. Brown, and searched the books, to see if he could find who had lost this watch, he went from there to a pawnbroker's, and from there to Sir Sampson Wright's office; they told him he had been there before, and what was the use of coming there so often: from there we went together to the corner of Princes-street, Drury-lane, from thence to the corner of Little Russel-street; and from there he took me over to his own house, and shewed me this watch, without its gold bazil or gilt minute hand; and said, that if he could bring the woman to justice, undoubtedly the watch would be his own, and he would make me some recompence for my trouble. From that we went to the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



             again, and we had a quarrel about the watch; and I told him I was a man of no principle if I would hurt a woman, and that if so be the woman required any defence from me, I would immediately appear against him: I stepped into the public tap-room; at the next door to the tap-room was a butcher's, I stepped out and got some stakes, and had them for my supper: accordingly, after he called for a pint of beer, he wanted to make it up, and I would not; and there came in a man, and they seemed to discourse a long time together; after that he rather prevailed on me, and we were good friends again: I accordingly drank with them, and there was another man with them; he said he wanted to go to Vauxhall, and went out after whispering to this man, and brings in that gentleman with the brown coat (Mr. Young) and sits with him down in the box, and they had a pint of beer together; he then calls me to this man, and after a long preamble with them both about America, he told me this man had got a watch which he was repairing, and sent me home for a screw-driver, persuading me it was to repair that watch there. On going into the house, I asked Mrs. Beadle if she had got a screw-driver to send to her brother; without any hesitation, or looking at the drawer, she told me she had lost a watch; I immediately ran after the man, and a gentleman who is a patrole came and seized me, and detained me. That is the only defence I can make, which is true.
Court to Beadle. Is this true, which the prisoner has been saying, about your being together that day? - I saw him at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



             that morning, and I sent him to ask for 
               
                  Sophia
                   Johnson
               



            ; but he was not with me in the company of Mr. Young, nor did I send him for the watch.
Had you received the watch from Mr. 
               
                  Young
               


             that day? - I had had it in my possession three days.
Are you very sure that you never sent him with any message whatever to your sister? - I never did; what he has said about that is false: upon my oath, before God, I sent him in no respect on the face of the earth.
The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.



               GUILTY
            . (Aged 22.)
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

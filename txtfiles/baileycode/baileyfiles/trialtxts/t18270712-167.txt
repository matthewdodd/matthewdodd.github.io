                  , from his person
            .
SAMUEL HARRISON. I live with Mr. Hornylove, a trunk-maker, in the City-road. Last Sunday night, about half-past ten o'clock, I was at the corner of Gloucester-row, Hoxton


, going home to my aunt's, with a bundle, containing these articles. Just as I turned round the row, the prisoner came behind, and snatched it out of my hand- he ran into Myrtle-street - I pursued, and called Stop thief! I lost sight of him in Cross-street, for about three minutes, but I saw him again, and he was taken - my bundle was picked up by the watchman. I am certain of his person; no one else was running.

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty; heard a cry of Stop thief! went out of my box, and saw a mob with the prisoner - the bundle was thrown down by somebody. I took it up, and took the prisoner to the watch-house - I did not see who the bundle fell from.

            . I was in Myrtle-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I pursued the prisoner and took him about one hundred yards off - nobody was running before him, I am certain. He immediately said, "Pray let me go, I have dropped it" - I took him back.

            . I am a watchman. I assisted in taking the prisoner back.(Property produced and sworn to.)

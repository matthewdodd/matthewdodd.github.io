GEORGE BERRY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of August, 2 pairs of boots, value 8s.; 1 pair of shoes, value 1s. 6d.; and 1 apron, value 4d.; the goods of 




Peter Newlyn, his master.






PETER NEWLYN
. I am a shoemaker and live at Waterloo-street, St. Luke's. On the 4th of August I had a bill in my window for a lad—the prisoner came and offered himself—I agreed to give him 6s. a week, and, if he suited, 7s., 6d., and to teach him the trade for nothing—he came about ten o'clock in the morning, and stayed till a quarter past three in the afternoon—he then left, and next day, which was Friday, I missed a pair of Wellington boots, a pair of Clarence boots, and an apron—I informed the police, and found some of my property at Mr. Clark's the pawnbroker's on the Saturday—he was taken into custody on the Saturday following.





JOHN BENNETT
. I live at Mr. Clark's, a pawnbroker, in Old-street. I have a pair of Clarence boots pawned, I believe, by the prisoner, on the morning of the 6th of August, in the name of Smith.





JAMES BRENNAN
. I am a policeman. I made inquiries and found these boots—I then took the prisoner in Old-street, at the corner of Golden-lane, at a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening—I took him to the station-house, and found only the duplicate of these boots on him—the rest of the things we cannot find.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

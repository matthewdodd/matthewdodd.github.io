MARY WATSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of March, 9 yards of printed cotton, value 6s. 9d., the goods of 



Thomas Butler; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD LLOYD
. I am shopman to Thomas Butler, a linen-draper in Shoreditch. On the 16th of March the prisoner and another came in, and one of them asked the price of a dress in the window—they then wished to look at some other dresses—I gave them seats, and placed four dresses before them on the counter—they then wished to look at a shawl pattern which was in the window, and when I came back I missed one off the counter—they then looked at some others, selected one, and left 1s. deposit on it—I made them a bill, and gave them a receipt for the 1s.—they wished me good afternoon, and went to the door—I went after them—the prisoner heard me behind her, and she turned back, and said, "Oh dear, I have got a dress I have not paid for"—I insisted on her dropping it—she tried to throw it on the counter, but it fell by the side—this is the dress.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep what is called a tally-shop? A. No, but we take a deposit on any article which a person looks at—the prisoner turned round with this dress just as I was going to catch hold of her—she said afterwards she would pay for it.





EDWARD HURCHINGS
 (City police-constable, No. 85.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then tried by the name of Newton.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

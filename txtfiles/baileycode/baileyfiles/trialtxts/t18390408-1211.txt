WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of March, 2 cloaks, value 3l., the goods of 



Julia Hynam; and 1 cloak, value 10s., the goods of 



Caroline Gordon Sewell.






JULIA HYNAM
. I am a widow, and live in Clarendon-square. On the 18th of March my servant came up to me with a message—in consequence of what I said to her she ran down, and I heard her cry, "Thieves"—I went down, and found the hall door open, and some medicine which had been on the hall table thrown down and broken—the servant returned in a minute or two, and gave me these cloaks—two are mine, and one belongs to Caroline Gordon Sewell.





ELIZABETH EYRES
. I am servant to the prosecutrix On Monday evening, the 18th of March, the prisoner came to the door, and said he came from Mr. Jones, of Tottenham Court-road, for a pair of trowsers to be mended for a gentleman—I let him in, shut the hall-door, and went up

stairs—I came down in less than two minutes, found the hall door wide open, and the cloaks gone off the hooks—I ran out—a young man gave me two of the cloaks off the pavement, and another was found in an area—I did not see the prisoner drop them—he was not taken till the Thursday morning—I am positive he is the person.

Prisoner. Q. How do you know me? A. I took notice of yon—I described you to the policeman the same night.





JAMES CARTER
 (police-constable S 140.) I took the prisoner on the 21st of March—I told him it was for stealing some cloaks from No, 50, Clarendon-square—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the house, and the servant said it was him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at home that evening from seven till tea o'clock with my mother—she was in court to-day, and could prove it.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

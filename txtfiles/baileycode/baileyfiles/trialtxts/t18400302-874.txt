THOMAS PEARCE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of February, 1 handkerchief, value 1d., the goods of 



George Edward Noone, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE EDWARD NOONE
. I am an engineer, living in Silver-street, Bloomsbury. I was in Holborn on the 24th of February—a person called to me—I turned, and found it was a policeman, who showed me this handkerchief, which is mine—(looking at it)—I had seen it safe an hour before—I know it is mine, as I had used it with a chemical process, it being of no value.





JOHN LEWIS ASHAM
 (police-constable F 119.) About eight o'clock at night, on the 24th of February, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner, with two others, attempt the prosecutor's pockets twice, then the prisoner took the handkerchief out, looked at it, and then threw it in the crossing of the street—I took it up, followed him, and called to the gentleman.

Prisoner. There were two young men before roe, one of them picked the pocket, and the policeman ran after me. Witness. I saw you take it, and no one else.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Holborn, when this policeman, dressed as a sailor, laid hold of me and accused me of this—he said I ran after the other two, but they chucked it down, and then he said at the office that I took it, but I had not.





JOHN PIPER
 (police-constable F 105.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.—Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

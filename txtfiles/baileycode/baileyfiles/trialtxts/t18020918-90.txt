Mrs. WATTS sworn. - My husband is a hairdresser
, and lives in Church-street, Mile-end


, the prisoner was servant
 in the house where we lodged; I missed the linen off a chest, and saw a part of the cap on her head, I knew it by the lace; she confessed it, and we found a calico gown behind her bed, and a shirt on her; I found some keys on her, which opened my drawers. (The property was produted and identified.)
Prisoner's defence. The shirt and cap lay on my bed, and being short of linen, I took the shirt till such time as I had washed my own; the woman saw the cap on my head, it belonged to her; I gave it her, and they took me up for stealing them, which I had not; as for the keys, I know nothing of them.

SARAH BROATHWICK. On the 8th or 9th of January the two prisoners came to my house, and one of them took a lodging of me by the week; they only staid one night, and went away without paying - I missed a pillow.
BENJAMIN SMITH. I am pawnbroker. I have a pillow pawned by Haines on the 9th of January.(Property produced and sworn to.)

Williams' Defence. Neither of them were pawned with an intention to defraud, but to replace them - we did not intend to go away; - we were out but one hour when the officer took us.

             - we live in Great James-street


, Lisson-groce. On the 19th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, this cotton had been at the side of the door, inside the shop; I saw it safe ten minutes before it was stolen, on a box, unfolded. I saw the prisoner take it, and followed him about two hundred yards from the door - I never lost sight of him; he threw it down - it was picked up by some other person, and taken to the shop; I am certain that it is the same piece.

            . I am a grover, and live in Little Newport-street, Soho. I was passing Mr. Filcher's shop, and saw the prisoner standing by the door. I saw him take the print, and ran after him. I saw him drop it; it was picked up by someone else.

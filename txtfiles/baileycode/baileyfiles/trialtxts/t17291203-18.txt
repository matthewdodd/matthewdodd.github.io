             thus depos'd. The Prisoner came into the House, and there was no body at home but a Child of six Months old, and my self; I thought the Prisoner went out again presently, but she did not, for afterwards going up Stairs, I found the Locks broke open, and the Goods gone; upon which I went out and found the Prisoner, and brought her home; I ask'd her if she had pawn'd the Goods, and told her I would advance Money to redeem them.
Mrs. Baty depos'd, That the Prisoner brought the Goods to her, and she lent her 16 s. on them, and, the Goods being produc'd in Court, the Prosecutor proving them to be hers; the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. and 10 d.

Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
Rodbeth. She was my servant
: I am a Pawnbroker
: and these goods were pawned with me, and in my warehouse. I missed them out of the warehouse, and found them concealed in the room where the prisoner lay, I charged her with taking them: she confessed she did take them, and had destroyed the bills that were upon each.

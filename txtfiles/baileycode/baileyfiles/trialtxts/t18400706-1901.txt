JOHN TYER
. I am a drummer in the Royal Marines at Woolwich. On the 26th of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go to the baker's barrow, lift up the sack, and take two half-quartern loaves out, he put them in a bag, put them on his shoulder, and went away—I saw Mr. Roberts and told him.





GEORGE ROBERTS
. I am a baker. I had my barrow at the corner of a street in Woolwich—I left for a few minutes—the witness told me what had happened—I lost the loaves altogether.




GUILTY

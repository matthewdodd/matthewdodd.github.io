            . I am a musician
. I lost my violin on the 13th of January.
Q. Are you quite blind - A. Yes.
Q. You do not know who took it, do you - A. I suspected the prisoners.
Q. Where was it taken from you - A. At Mr. Underwood's, Shoreditch. I went in a little after eleven to take a little refreshment.

            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Archibald 
                  Nichols
               



            . I and my husband went to Mr. Underwood's, the Gun public-house, Shoreditch


, on the 13th of January, a few minutes before eleven o'clock. My husband wished to take a little porter before we went home. I went in and my husband called for a pint of porter. The prisoners all were in discourse with us; the subject of the discourse was concerning a dance that was to be the next day. When my husband finished his pint of porter, he put on his hat to return home. and feeling for the violin, he found it was gone. I had put it down by the side of him. I made every enquiry, but could get no intelligence of it whatever. It was gone. On the next day, I found the violin at a pawnbrokers in Whitechapel. There were other persons in the room, but there were none that were in discourse with us. I did not see it taken. Whether it was taken while I went for the pint of beer, or afterwards, I cannot say. I sat my husband down on the box, and put the violin by the side of him.

            . I am shop boy to Mr. Needes, pawnbroker, No. 7, Paternoster-row, Spitalfields. On the 14th of January, the two men prisoners came to our shop; they brought a fiddle with them, and asked me if my master was at home. I said, yes, he was at breakfast. I called him. They said they were sorry to give him so much trouble; they would be glad if he would tell them the worth of the violin. Master looked at it, and said he thought it was worth about a guinea, but he said it was according to people's fancy. They said they were much obliged to him; they had bought it for fifteen shillings. Master said it was cheap. They went out of the shop. That is all I know. I am quite sure they are the same men; I took particular notice of them.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Fleming, Whitechapel, a pawnbroker. On the 14th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, a young man brought me the violin to pledge. I believe it to be Kemp. He had a blue apron on. I lent him nine shillings on it. On the evening of the same day, Mrs. Nichols came to our shop to know if we had taken in a violin. I told her I had taken one in in the morning. I shewed it her; it was her's. At Worship-street office, the blind man swore to the fiddle by the crack in it, and to the bow.
Prosecutor. That is my bow, and this is my violin. There is a particular edge to it, and it has a particular tone. I have had it two years.
Beazley's Defence. I am innocent.
Kemp's Defence. The same.
Norget's Defence. The same.
Starling's Defence. The same.
Kemp called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.

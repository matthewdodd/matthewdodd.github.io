            . I am a flax-dresser
, and live in Whitechapel-road


; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment out of my lodging three weeks ago last Tuesday; my room door was broke open when I was out.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I had been out to work that day; when I came home between four and five in the afternoon, I foun d my room door broke open, and the things taken out of a box and trunk.

            . I am the landlady of the house; I had been out that day three quarters of an hour; coming back again I met my husband; he said the house is robbed; I went home, and up stairs I found Mr. Ball's door broke open; I made the best of my way towards Stepney, I met 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Bedford 
               



             in the first field; I passed her; after that I met a gentleman; I asked him if he saw a boy with a parcel; he said they have just been parting things in that field, which they had in a sack; I went back to 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Bedford 
               



             and said, if you have any thing belonging to me, give them me; a gentleman came to assist me; I took from her a pair of stuff pumps, a pair of lawn sleeves, two linen handkerchiefs, a silk one, a white necklace, two ribbons; I held her till

             came, and he owned the things; she said a button-maker gave her them.

                  Prescott 
               



            . I am a constable; going along Cable-street the boy at the bar and another were selling things in the day-time; we watched them out of Wellclose-square into Whitechapel; then I laid hold of the boy; he had a bag with these things in it, a pair of buckskin breeches, two pair of stockings, a pair of stays, a cloth waistcoat, a coloured apron, a white handkerchief, a stuff quilted petticoat, a stuff gown, a lawn apron, a shirt, a neckcloth, a pair of thread stockings, and a pair of cotton stockings; the other boy with this boy was cleared before the Justice, (the things produced and deposed to.)
Barnet's defence.
I know nothing at all of it; I saw the things lying in the fields, and I took them up to see what they were.
Bedford's defence.
As I was walking along the fields I saw a couple of boys, one of them had a great bag on his shoulder; they dropped these things, I went and picked them up; the woman came and passed me, a man said something to her; then she turned back and asked me what I had in my pocket; I shewed her what I had; they asked me about two boys; I told them as well as I could.
A. Griffiths. The boy at the bar is a button-maker.

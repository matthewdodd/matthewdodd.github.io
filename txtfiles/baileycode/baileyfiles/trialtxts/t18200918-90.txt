THOMAS GRIFFITHS. I am a carpenter
. On the night of the 22d of July, I was going down Gray's Inn-lane


, two or three woman stood at the corner of Liquorpond-street. The prisoners followed me down Gray's Inn-lane, and laid hold of my arms on each side. Hawkins asked me to go home with her - I said No. She immediately snatched my watch from my fob, and handed it to Gibson. I seized Hawkins, and Gibson ran away - I called the watchman, and he took Gibson.

Prisoner HAWKINS. Q. Was you not tipsey - A. No. It was about twelve o'clock.

            . I am sergeant of the watch. I was on duty near the end of Little Gray's Inn-lane. The prosecutor gave Hawkins to me, and said, in her presence, that he saw her hand his watch to another woman. I sent Murphy after her - he brought Gibson back, and took the watch from her pocket.

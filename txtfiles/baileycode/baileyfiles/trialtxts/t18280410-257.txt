 - I let two furnished rooms to the prisoner, on the 17th of March, at 5s. 6d. a week - she lived with me one week, and entered on another, when she leftsuddenly; leaving the door locked: after she was gone I went into her room - I missed all these things, and found the duplicate of this glass, between a card-table; I went to the pawnbroker's, to see if it was mine, and there I met her. All these things were let to her with the lodgings - I have since found the bed, which was pawned.

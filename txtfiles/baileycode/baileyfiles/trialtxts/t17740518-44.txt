            . I am a milk carrier
: I went into a cow-house to take up my lodging; the prisoner lay with me in a hay loft; when I lay down I had my money in my pocket, wrapped up in a speech about a woman that murdered her husband; when I waked, the prisoner was up; I missed my money, and charged him with having it; he made off; I got up and pursued him, and charged the watch with him; he was taken to the round-house and searched, and the money found upon him all but a shilling.

            . I took the prisoner to the round house, and searched him; I found two half crowns, a shilling, and some halfpence upon him, wrapped up in a paper.
Prosecutor. I told the watchman before he searched, there was a Queen Ann's half crown.
Bannister. He told me; it turned out exactly as he said; there was a remarkable halfpenny; it has an Adam and Eve upon it. (The money produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked up the money in the hay loft; I kicked it before me; I did not know what it was. There are a good many fellows lodge up in the hay loft as well as he and I.

WILLIAM SIMEON
. I live at No. 3, King-street, Portman square, and am a cutler. I had knives and other things in my window—I had a broken pane of glass, and these knives were put near it—I received information that two boys were running away—I went out and saw them, but could not catch them—these three knives are mine, and were taken from my window.





SAMUEL BALDWIN
. I live at No. 4, Park-square Mew. I was passing, and saw these two boys running from the window, and the prosecutor after them—I pursued the boys, but could not catch them—I told the policeman, and he took them.





AMBROSE CHANNER
 (police-constable S 137.) I found the prisoner Dunn, in a passage—I called another policeman to stop Mitchell, which he did, and on Mitchell were found these three knives, and on Dunn a lucifer box.

Mitchell. Dunn gave me the knives after he stole them.

Dunn. No, I did not give them to him.
(The prisoner Mitchell received a good character.)

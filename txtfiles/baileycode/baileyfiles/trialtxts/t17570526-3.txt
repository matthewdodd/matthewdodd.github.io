                  Marshal 
               



            . My husband's name is Peter. About the 8th or 9th of March last the prisoner came to my shop, and desired I would send some hats to her mistress. I ask'd her who her mistress was; she did not tell me her name, but said I might send a servant with them, which I did.
Q. What is that servant's name?
E. Marshal. Her name is 
               
                  Ann 
                  Cox 
               



            . She returned and said the person had cheated her out of them, and got away. We went into that neighbourhood and inquired if there was such a person, describing her, and some people took her some time after and sent for us. We went and took her before justice St. Lawrance, where we charg'd her with taking the hats; she own'd she did take and pawn them at three different pawnbrokers, and by her direction we went and found them, here they be (producing them.)
Q. Where is your husband?
E. Marshal. He is extremely ill, and cannot attend the court.


                  Ann 
                  Cox 
               



            . When the prisoner came for some hats to shew her mistress, Mrs. Marshal sent me with them along with her. When we came to the door the prisoner ask'd me for the hats, and said she'd go and shew them to her mistress. I let her have them. She went up stairs and came down again, and desired I'd walk up one pair of stairs, and she would go and get a light. I went up.
Q. What time was this?


                  Ann 
                  Cox 
               



            . This was between seven and eight o'clock at night; when I went up stairs I ask'd if such a person had brought any hats there. The people told me no such a person liv'd there, and the prisoner did not return with a light. Then I went and told my mistress how I had been served.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not carry these hats to pawn myself, one Mrs. Marshal took them from me, and carry'd them to pawn, and pawn'd them in my name.

HENRY JOHNSTON



, feloniously carnally knowing and abusing 




Catherine Davis, aged five years.

(In this case, the child, when brought before the Magistrate, was not deemed competent to take the oath, and had been placed under instruction for that purpose. The
RECORDER, after putting some questions to her, directed her to be sworn.
MR. RIBTON
for the prisoner, at the conclusion of the case, referred to a passage in "Russell on Crimes" to Reg. v. Williams, 7 Car. and Payne 320, and Reg. v. Hall, Sessions Paper, vol. 31, page 72, to show that instruction as to the nature of an oath communicated for the mere purposes of the trial, was by no means satisfactory. The
RECORDER
thought the law in Russell was laid down much too broadly; this was a matter in the discretion of the
COURT, and if upon reflection he should alter his opinion, the prisoner should have the benefit of it.)

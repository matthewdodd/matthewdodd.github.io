 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of January, 2 coats, value 9s. 6d.; and 1 handkerchief, value 6d. the goods of 



James Park.






JAMES PARK
. I live at the coach-yard, Pell-street, Ratcliffe Highway, The prisoner is a relation of my wife's—I got him to clean my garret, and left him in my room to lie down, between three and four o'clock, on the 20th of January—I had two coats there on a table—I went up to lie down, and did not come back till between five and six—when I came back the coats and the prisoner were gone—the handkerchief produced was in the right-hand pocket of one of the coats—it was taken from him at the station—sometimeshe is a little diseased in his mind—he will go travelling about from place to place—I gave him shelter—he knows right from wrong—he drinks when he can get it.


Prisoner. Q. Did you ever know me to rob you of a penny before? A. No, I have trusted you in my room.





MARY PARK
. This is my husband's handkerchief—it was gone with the coats—it was found in the prisoner's pocket at the station.

Prisoner. I was cooking potatoes for you, and you went up stairs; I found you in a state of intoxication; they gave me the handkerchief. Witness. No, I did not.





EDWARD WIGLEYM
 (police-constable H 141.) I took the prisoner, and found this handkerchief in his breast-pocket—he said it was given him by the prosecutor, that he knew nothing about the coats—he said he would be the death of the prosecutor, and blow the house up with gunpowder—he struck the female witness in the court.





JAMES PARK

re-examined. This handkerchief is mine—I did not give it to him—no one could have got into the house but him—when he went away he drew the door to, which shuts with a spring lock—no one could have got in.

             sworn.
On the 29th of March, I lost a pair of boots from my shop, between the hours of twelve and one at noon: about two hours after, upon enquiring at the pawnbrokers and boot-shops, I found them stopped in Rosemary-lane, at a boot-shop (the boots produced), with the name cut off.

             sworn.
I am a shoemaker, in Rosemary-lane, in the county of Middlesex. About twelve o'clock, or half after, on the 29th of March, these two girls, the prisoners, came by, and offered these boots for sale; I suspected them to be stolen, and stopped the boots, but not the parties, as I knew them; they deal in old things, which they buy about town: I sent all round the neighbourhood, to see if any one would own them.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I deal in changing for old clothes: coming from Deptford over London-bridge, I bought the boots of a man for 6 s. and I carried them to Mr. Johnson's shop to sell.

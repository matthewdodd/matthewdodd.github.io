, in Old-street-road


. On the 29th of January the prisoner came to the shop, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and looked out 5l. or 6l. worth of goods, which were shown him by our young man - the last articles he looked at were some silk shawls; I did not see him take one - a bundle was made up of the things which he had bought, and he said, "if you will wait a moment I will fetch a person to pay for them;" he was suspected, and I was sent to watch him - he went on to Mr. Board's, a pawnbroker, in Shoreditch; he went in the front shop, and they sent him round to the boxes - I went and asked what he came for; they said to pawn this shawl, which is my master's, and has our shop mark on it - he was detained.

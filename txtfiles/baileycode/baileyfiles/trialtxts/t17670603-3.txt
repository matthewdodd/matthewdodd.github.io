            , and I, are partners



; the prisoner is a Dane
; he was our 
servant








 from the 9th of March to the 4th of May; the men who lost their things were all our servants, and lived in the house. I went out of town on the 18th of May, and coming home on the 19th over Tower hill, I met 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Price 
               



            , one of our men, he told me the men had been robbed of their cloaths; we suspected the prisoner; Ulmore told me on the Saturday night following, that he heard the prisoner was got on board a ship going to Norway, the ship was called 
               
                  Anna 
                  Maria 
               



            , Capt. Bockman or Beckman; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and desired he would give me some assistance. I was advised to proceed after the prisoner as fast as I could; Ulmore and I went in a chaise to Gravesend, and found the ship had failed the night before; then we took a boat and went down to the Hope; there we found the ship; I went on deck and told the captain I had been robbed, and suspected the thief was on board his ship, and desired if we found any thing upon him that he had stole, he would let me take him on shore; he said, with all his heart; the captain called the prisoner down; I seeing he had got a watch, I desired to look at it; he took it out of his pocket and delivered it to me, (produced in court;) 
               
                  Charles 
                  Ulmore 
               



             looked at it and said, he would swear it was his watch; the captain ordered the prisoner's chest and things to be put into my boat; then I found there were many of the things done up into our scum bag, which is worth about 2 s. we took him and the things into our boat; he seemed to cry and was very uneasy, and said, he hoped I would let him go. We brought him to Gravesend; I opened his box there, and found several of the things which were missing, but cannot particularize them; I remember seeing this brass tobacco-box there (produced in court;) the box was fastened up, and we left that there, and ordered it to be sent up by the Gravesend boat; we took the prisoner with us, and brought him to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; the prisoner not understanding me. I did not examine or change him till he was brought there. 
C C. I was servant to Mr. Downing; I went there on the 6th of May, that was after the prisoner was gone; we found all these thing were gone; on a Tuesday morning, about ten days after I was there, I found the bar of the sugar-oue window was sawed off, and the window opened; the things were taken from our bed room where we all lay, seven of us; by getting in at the window they oculdtasily come into that room, the door not being fast; I missed: the things mentioned in the indictment, said to be mine (mentioning there by name;) we all of us went to bed a little after ten over night, then all our things were in the room, and all were gone by four in the morning; I went with Mr. Downing to take the prisoner; this watch which the prisoner delivered to Mr. Downing is my property; (the rest of the things produced and deposed to by the respective owners)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

             - We keep a Repository for the sale of horses

, in Goswell-street, the prisoner was in our employ; his duty was to receive money on our account, and to keep the books. In consequence of his absconding I examined the books, and discovered a deficiency of 600l.

            . I was sent by my father to fetch a mare from Messrs. Sadlers' Repository, and paid the prisoner 10l. 18s. 6d. I paid him a 5l. note, and the rest in small notes, half a guinea, and some silver.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had seen him before. I am sure he is the man.

            . I have my cash-book, there is no entry of that sum, nor did the prisoner ever account to me for it.
Cross-examined. It is entered in the sale-book, and paid put to it; he ought to have entered it in the cashbook immediately after he received it.

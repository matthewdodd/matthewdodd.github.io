WILLIAM GEORGE FINNISTER
. I drive an errand cart for Mr. Horatio Webb. On the 1st of December I was driving it in Sloane-street, Chelsea, and met the prisoner—we got chatting together, and I asked him if he would give me a hand—I left him with my cart, while I left my parcels at different houses—he went a good distance round with me—he left me near the Six Bells, in King's-road—a little time after he was gone I felt in my great coat pocket and missed my bag, containing 3l. 15s. 9d.—there were two sovereigns, and the rest was in silver and half-pence—I had left my coat in the cart with the prisoner—nobody but him had been in the cart—I have lost the money altogether.





WILLIAM WISDOM
 (police-constable B 108.) I apprehended the prisoner, and told him it was on suspicion of robbing Mr. Webb's boy of 3l. 15s. 9d.—he said, "Very well, I will go with you, I had only part of the money, Harry Dance had the rest"—as we were going to the station-house he said, "How much do they say they have lost?"—I said, "4l. 15s. 9d."—he said, "No, there was only 3l. 15s. 9d."—he said, when we were at the station-house, "I took it out of Finnister's pocket near the Six Bells, in King's-road, Chelsea," and he even stated that there was two sovereigns, and the rest was in silver and copper.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years to the Juvenile Prison.

             sworn. - On the 6th of February I took charge of the prisoner; I searched his pockets, and I found a pair of silk stockings; I apprehended him going into Mary-le-bonna watch-house; I saw Mr. Bushby's name printed upon the top of them; I found the shirt upon his back, (the shirt and stockings produced); Mr. Bushby's name is upon both the shirt and stockings; I have had them ever since in my possession.
Marshall. These stockings are my master's, the name is in full length; this shirt is my master's.
Prisoner's defence. Marshall asked me to come and help him to clean the plate, and accordingly I did; I took off my great coat, and when I had done, I put it on, and I did not search it for two or three days afterwards, and then I found the shirt and stockings; when I was going after my place on the Thursday morning, I put the shirt on, that is all I know about it.

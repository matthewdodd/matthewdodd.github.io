            . I am employed to collect money for my father
, who is a brewer. On the 25th of January I went to Mr. Wilson's shop, in St. Martin's-court, to order a book, about twelve o'clock - the prisoner was there serving customers. I took out my pocket-book when I was there, and laid it on the counter, it contained seven 10 l. and fourteen 1 l. notes. I went away, and in about twenty minutes I missed my pocket-book. I returned to the shop - the prisoner was not there - I informed the people I had lost it; he came in in about half an hour. Mr. Richards asked him if he had seen it? he said he had not. About a week after, Gatty produced a 10 l. note to me, which I knew to be one of those I had lost.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Tooley-street, Borough. On the 29th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner bought a pair of plated candlesticks and snuffers and stand of me, and paid me a 10 l. note. I know he is the man.

            . The prisoner was our shopman. I asked him if he had seen the pocket-book? he said he had not. When he was apprehended he sent for me, said he did take it off the counter, and paid a 10 l. note in Tooley-street - that he changed the remainder of the notes, bought into the Funds, and threw some checks and bills which were in the book over Blackfriars-bridge.

            . The 10 l. note is mine.

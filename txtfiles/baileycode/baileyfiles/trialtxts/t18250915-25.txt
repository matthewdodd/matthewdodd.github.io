AARON ROWLEY. I live in South-place, Somers'-town


. I had seventeen fowls on Saturday, the 20th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I missed eight of them the next morning: I found them on Monday morning at the watch-house, and knew them to be mine; six of them were alive, and two dead.

            . I am a watchman. I was calling the hour on Sunday morning, near the Bedford nursery, and saw the prisoner there with a bag; I asked what he had got; he said, only some fowls, which he had got from Churchway, and was going to take them to the Seven-dials. I took him to the watch-house with them.

            . I am watch-house keeper. I received the fowls; the dead ones were quite warm. I shewed them to the prosecutor on Monday morning.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from work on Saturday night, and saw a man with these fowls to sell; I bought them at 1 s. 6 d. a piece, and on the Sunday morning I was going along with them when the watchman stopped me, and asked me where I got them - I told him.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an inn-keeper, at Dancer's-hill, in the county of Middlesex: On the 27th of February, when the waggon came to my house, about two o'clock in the day, it was all right; it was a narrow wheeled waggon, with five horses, it contained two ton; about nine o'clock at night, I received intelligence that the waggon had been robbed; I went to look at the waggon, and I observed the ropes cut, I had seen it about a quarter of an hour before, and then it was perfectly safe; the waggon was robbed at my house, it stopped there till Sunday; the ropes were cut, and the sheet let down; I looked into the waggon, and saw a space where the chests would have come out; in consequence of that, I went in pursuit o f the thieves; there was some straw removed in the waggon, and I tracked the straw down a lane that led to Mobs-hole, about half a mile from my house, and there I found a mare and a cart, and in the cart two chests of tea; we brought the tea back, and the next day took the horse and cart to Bow-street; about half an hour after we had brought the chests back, I saw the prisoner, Hickman, and another man, go past my house, I had never seen them before, it was a moon-light night; we pursued them, and took them; the person that was with Hickman, said they had come from St. Alban's that they had been there to meet a drove of sheep, and stopped at a house at South Mims; I set off to enquire at South Mims, and while I was gone the other man ran away.
Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. Was it Hickman or the other man that said he came from St. Alban's? - A. It was Hickman; and the other said he had come from the Trumpet, ast St. Alban's.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a soldier in the first regiment of Tower-Hamlet militia; On the 27th of February, I saw the two prisoners between six and seven o'clock; Field had a Bath great-coat, with a white velvet collar, at the White-lion, Finchley-common; Field and another man came in a chaise-cart, Hickman rode upon a saddle-horse, the cart was about a minute before him, they stopped there about three quarters of an hour; I did not see any name upon the cart, it had a remarkable high front board, I saw it within these two minutes in the yard, I am certain it is the same; I had never seen the prisoners before; but what made me take particular notice of them was, that Field was flashing about the house with a whip in his hand, whipping the landlord's dogs; Field drove the cart.
- RUTHVEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I apprehended Field on the 9th of March, at the Bleeding Heart, in Parker's-lane, Drury-lane, I knew him before; he asked what we wanted him for; says he, I suppose it is about that b-y horse and cart; he had this great coat on at the time, which being a particular one, we took off from him.

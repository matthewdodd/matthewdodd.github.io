 and 




DAVID MEDHURST

10th of January, 1 piece of handkerchiefs, value 21s., the goods of 



George Everingham.






ROBERT JOHNSON
. I am shopman to Mr. George Everingham, of Leadenhall-street. About two or three o'clock, on the 10th of January, the two prisoners came in, and Brady asked to look at some loves—I showed them a pair, which they declined, on account of their not being lined—I went to another part of the shop for another pair—I then suspected and watched them—I saw Medhurst take a piece of silk handkerchiefs off the counter, and give it to the other, who immediately concealed it in his trowsers—I came back with a paper of French gloves and showed them—they selected one pair, and then left the shop—I followed them, and a policeman going by took them—they were brought back, and the handkerchiefs found on Brady's person—these are them—they are Mr. George Everingham's—they have the mark on them.





JAMES SOUNDY
 (City police-constable No. 53.) I was on duty in Leadenhall-street, opposite the shop, and saw the two prisoners come out—they had not got three yards before Mr. Johnson came out and gave them into custody—I took them back to the shop, and found this piece of handkerchiefs concealed en Brady—in the right-hand-side.

Brady. Another boy, bigger than Medhurst, gave them to me, and I put them into my breeches.





ROBERT JOHNSON

re-examined. There was no other boy there but Medhurst.

Medhurst. I can take my oath I did not take them—I went for a pair of gloves, and bought them. Witness. You took the handkerchiefs—I cannot be mistaken.

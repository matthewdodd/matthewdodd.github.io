            . I am a farmer
 at Hendon


. I locked these geese up myself, in a cart-house, the evening before I missed them; there was a gander amongts them, with a black spot under his right wing. The next morning my man give me an alarm, in consequence of that, I came towards London to trace them, and Mr. Henson shewed them to me at Kenfish Town; he also shewed me a horse-picker, and a knife, which had been in my stable the night before, and which he said he took from the prisoner. On the knife, were feathers, and blood.

            . I am a constable; I was in the Back-lane, at about twenty minutes before five in the morning of the 6th of June; I saw the prisoner, and another man in that lane, resting two bags; they were bloody. I asked them what they had got, and the prisoner spoke civily, and said, geese; on examining them, I found that the geese were warm. I then told them that they were my prisoners, and the other man struck at me, and made his escape. The prisoner behaved very civily, and I thought it my duty to take him to the watch-house, as the geese were warm. He said they were his own, and that he lived on Barnet-common. The prosecutor came soon after to the watch-house, and owned the geese.

WILLIAM NOBLE
. I am a linen-draper, and live in High-street, Shoreditch—this is my figured Orleans cloth—it was safe in my shop about half-past seven o'clock on the 5th of Nov., hanging inside my shop, and about eight o'clock the policeman brought it to me—I am sure it is mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Have you any partner? A, No.





GEORGE TREW
 (police-constable H125.) On Saturday, the 5th of Nov., I was with another officer in private clothes—I saw the prisoners looking into the prosecutor's window—I suspected them—I crossed and saw another boy, not in custody, go to this piece of Orleans cloth, which was inside the shop, and give it a tug, then Thompson went and gave it a tug—then Daniels gave a tug, and pulled it down—then Thompson took it, and ran away—I met him—he dropped the cloth, and ran away—I took them both at the Lord Mayor's show, on the 9th of Nov.—I knew them both well.





THOMAS BURTON
 (police-constable H 83.) I was with Trew—I have heard his evidence—it is true.
(Thompson received a good character.)

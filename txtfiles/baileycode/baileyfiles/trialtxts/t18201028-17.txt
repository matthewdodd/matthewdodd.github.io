            . On the 8th of October, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I was coming down Walker's-court, Portman-street


, the prisoner and another man came up, hustled me, pulled me out of the court, and he took my watch out, and 12 s. 6 d. from my pocket. They both ranaway - I followed, and the patrol stopped the prisoner in Crown-court, and as he went in at the watch-house door, he dropped my watch. I am certain he is the man, as I never lost sight of him.

            . I am a watchman. I saw Welch following the prisoner, stopped him, took him to the watch-house, and he dropped the watch at the door.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He was lying on the step of a door, intoxicated - we took him to Green-court, he did not seem much drunk, and we left him - he called Stop thief! and I was taken. He brought the watch in, and said I dropped it.

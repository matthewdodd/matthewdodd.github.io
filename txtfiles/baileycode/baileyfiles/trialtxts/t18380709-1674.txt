ELEAZER BOOT
. I live in Great George-street, Westminster. On Saturday, the 30th of June, I was in Hyde-park—I felt something—I turned, and saw my handkerchief in the officer's hand—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it.)





RICHARD BRADSHAW
 (police-constable D 102.) At a quarter past one o'clock, on the 30th of June, I was in Hyde-park, opposite Clark's booth—I saw the two prisoners together—Lindsey got behind M'Henry, pushed him forward, and M'Henry took this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, put it into his bosom, and ran off.





EDWIN BAXTER
 (police-constable D 115.) I was in the Park. I saw the two prisoners behind the prosecutor, they were talking together—I saw M'Henry attempt to take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he brought it out a little way and turned away—then Lindsey took him by the arm and put him up to the prosecutor again, and then he took out the handkerchief—they ran in different directions, and we took them.

Lindsey's Defence. I never saw this boy before in my life.

            . I am servant to Mr. Morgan, of Stamford-hill


. On the 1st of August, at half-past five o'clock, this coat was in the coach-house, on the carriage-box; the door was a little open; the prisoner came into the forecourt. I went to hang the harness up, and saw the door close. I opened the yard door and saw the prisoner coming from the coach-house door; he asked if I wanted to buy any shavings. I found the coat in his basket, under the shavings - he ran off. I followed and secured him without losing sight of him.


                  JOHN 
                  CAMPBELL
               



            . I am a constable. I was about fifty yards from Mr. Morgan's, and saw the prisoner walking towards me; the coachman came out and called to him to stop, he walked faster and then ran. Archer followed, and he dropped the basket. Archer hallooed out, Stop thief! I secured him and found the coat under the shavings.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. It was never in my hands. I was passing the gate, when a man dropped the basket at my feet.

            . I am a pawnbroker in Compton-street. On the 28th of February, the prisoner came to my shop, and brought one chair with him; he asked me if I would buy two, and he would fetch the other. From the manner he behaved, I suspected him. He asked me thirty shillings for them. I caused him to be taken into custody. These are the chairs that he offered to me, I am positive of it. I kept them in my custody until I brought them here.
Prosecutor. They are my elbow chairs; they were in my shop. I lost them on the 28th of February.
Prisoner's Defence. I gave fourteen shillings for them chairs of a man in the street; he appeared to be a porter. I went to Mr. Perryman; I asked him if he would buy them, saying, I had two of them, he should have them reasonable. I left one with him, and went for the other; then he had me detained.

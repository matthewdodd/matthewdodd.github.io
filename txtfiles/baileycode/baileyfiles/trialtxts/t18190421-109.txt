, who are ironmongers

, and live in Foster-lane


. On the 13th of February, the prisoner came to the shop and said, he came from Mr. Barber for two standing vices - we used often to supply Mr. Barber with vices. He produced this order - (reads.)
"For D. Barber, one standing vice, 40 lbs., one ditto 30 lbs., J. Stubbs." I knew Mr. Barber had a man named Stubbs, and I delivered him the vices, which are worth 43 s.

            . I am an ironmonger, and live in Wood-street - I often send to Messrs. Hillman and Co. for goods. On the 12th of February, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Stubbs
               



             was in my service, at my other shop at Rotherhithe. I never sent the prisoner for the vices - the order is not Stubbs's writing. I believe it to be the prisoner's writing - he was in my service about a year ago.

JOHN DOYLE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Joseph Berry King, from his person.






JOSEPH BERRY KING
. I live near Belgrave-square. On the 19th of April I was in Regent-circus—the prisoner came and asked charity, and while I was selecting a 6d. to give him, he picked my pocket of my handkerchief—I was told of it afterwards—I went back and collared him—he offered me my handkerchief—I called an officer and gave him into custody.





JOHN NIGHTINGALE
. I live in Queen-street, Westminster, and am a carpenter. I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner, who swept the crossing—the prosecutor was giving him something, and the prisoner picked his pocket of his handkerchief—I told the prosecutor, and he came back and took the prisoner.





RICHARD MARKHAM
 (police-constable C 129.) I was in the Circus, that evening—the prosecutor had the prisoner, and gave him into my custody with this handkerchief—I asked the prisoner how he came to do it while the gentleman was relieving him—he said I might go to the devil; I had got the handkerchief, and what did I want to chaff him for.


Prisoner's Defence. I asked him for 6d. and he gave it to me; after he was gone I found the handkerchief—he came back and asked me if I had found a handkerchief—I said I had, and gave it to him.

MR. KING. He denied at first that he had it.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

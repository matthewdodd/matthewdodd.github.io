            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 8th of March, about half past eleven o'clock in the morning. I saw the prisoners in the Park as the guard was being releaved - they were together, and attempted several gentlemens' pockets - a gentleman passed along, they attempted his pocket several times and when he got to the gate, Hillard thrust his hand into his pocket; took the handkerchief, and gave it to Cooley. who put it into his breeches - I seized them both; the gentleman claimed the handkerchief, and I thought he was following me, but there was a crowd; I thought they would rescue them, and I took them to the guard-house - the gentleman did not come forward; I have not seen him since; I do not know his name; it was marked, "C. R. R."

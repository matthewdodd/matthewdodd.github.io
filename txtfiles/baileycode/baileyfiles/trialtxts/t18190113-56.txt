            , who is a silk mercer
, and lives in the Minories


. On the 7th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, a woman came into the shop to look at some handkerchiefs; she made choice of a piece out of the window, which Mrs. Wilson showed her; she asked to see others. While Mrs. Wilson turned to get some, I saw the prisoner creep in the door-way, and snatch the handkerchiefs off the counter; Mrs. Wilson turned, saw his head, cried out, and he threw them on the floor; I ran after him, and brought him back - he took them off the counter.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I live at the Coach and Horses, a publick-house, in Great Marlborough-Street


. The prisoner was my servant
 about three months; I mist a guinea out of my till; I was told the same day by Mr. Wilmot, the boy at the bar had changed a 5 s. and 3 d. piece. I searched his pocket, but found nothing. When I charged him with it, he said, he changed that piece for a gentleman in the tap-room. In about a quarter of an hour after, the boy went up stairs, and put his clothes out at a window, and made off. On the 14th of December I took him again, and before Justice Spinage he owned he took a guinea, and a 5 s. and 3 d. piece.

Mr. Wilmot. On the 3d of December, the boy at the bar came in the evening, and I chang'd a 5 s. and 3 d. piece for him: I had some suspicion he did not get it honestly, so I told his master of it.
Prisoner. I am guilty. I am but fifteen years old.

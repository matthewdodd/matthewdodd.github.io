JOHN SEWELL, JUN. My father, John Sewell, is a wholesale toyman
, and lives in Fore-street, Cripplegate; on the 3d of February, a case containing the articles stated in the indictment, was put into a truck, of which Cadwallader had the care; they are worth 10l. or 11l.

            . I am porter to Mr. Sewell. On the 3d of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I had three chests in my truck, to convey to the Bell, in Friday-street; when I got about half way up the Bell inn yard


, they were all safe; a waggon prevented my getting the truck closer to the booking office - I took one chest off the truck, and carried it to the office; I put it down, and returned directly to the truck, and missed one of the others; I was not absent above three or four minutes - the waggoner wanted to drive out, and told me to push my truck out; when I got it out of the inn yard, I made inquiry - I had seen nobody about the yard; I carried the other chest into the office, and as I got in, the prisoner was brought up by Hughes, with the stolen chest - I am certain of it, by the direction that was on it.

            . I am a porter. About six o'clock on this evening, I was in my master's warehouse; our bell rang gently - I ran out, and saw the prisoner collared by two gentlemen, who asked if we would have a chest put into our warehouse, or carry it back to the Bell; for they said, in his hearing, they had stopped him, and seen him run with the chest from the truck - that there were three in the gang, but two had escaped; the prisoner said, thatthe two who ran away asked him to give them a lift up with it, which he was going to do - Cadwallader claimed it; I carried it to the Bell, and the gentlemen took the prisoner there.

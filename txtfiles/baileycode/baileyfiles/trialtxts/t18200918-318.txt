            . I live in Frith-street, Soho. On the 3d of July I was in a pastrycook's-shop in Oxford-street


. The City procession was returning from presenting an address to the Queen. I remained in the shop near the door; some people came up, pushed me, and snatched my watch. I have not recovered it.

            . I am a carpenter. I stopped by the pastrycook's window as the procession passed. The prisoner was running with four or five behind him. He stopped directly he came to the prosecutor, looked round, and they all stopped in the centre of the door, made a rush, and I saw the prisoner snatch the prosecutor's watch. I am certain of his person. I told the prosecutor of it. Jones and I ran, caught the prisoner in a public-house in Oxford-street, and gave him in charge.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who do you work for - A. Mr. Ward, of Pimlico. I am going to the East Indies. I live at Peckham. I lost sight of him, but I am certain he is the man.
Prisoner's Defence. He said at the office that he never lost sight of me. He said he would transport me to get his expences.

            . I live at Twickenham



, I am a higler
. On the 23rd of March I lost the bacon out of my shed in my yard; I had seen it safe at nine on the night before; on the next morning the neighbours called me up, I found the bacon gone; they cut the lath under the tiling, and got the door open; I picked up a handkerchief that they had left behind them. On the 11th of April I went to the prisoners house, in Twickenham Town, the constable and beadle were with me; the old prisoner was not at home, I went in, we found some bacon in the necessary out of doors, some in the chimney, and two pieces in the cellar; I know the piece of bacon I found in the cellar, that I have swore to. The old gentleman said to me; there George, you are satisfied now you have found the bacon; this was after we had found all the pieces.

            . I am the wife of the last witness, I remember loosing the bacon from the out-house; I went to Somerset's house with my husband, I saw the bacon found there, and the piece of bacon that came out of the chimney I know; I am sure that is part of the bacon that I lost out of the out-house. When 
               
                  George 
                  Somerset
               



             took the bacon out of the chimney, he threw it down, and said, can you swear to that.
Q. Was the the boy by at that time - A. No, he was taken in custody, and when the boy was brought in, he said what is the matter here. The little boy said in the presence of the other prisoner to the constable, his brother told him they were going to search the house, he must go and put the bacon were he could. This his the handkerchief my husband found in the stable.
Mr. Ives. I found the handkerchief just by were the bacon was hung up.

            . Can you say you ever saw me on your premises at any unlawful time - A. No, he was in the place the day before, I asked him to lay hold of a pig, he could not go into the place without seeing the bacon. It was taken on the 23rd, between twelveand one o'clock.

            . I live at Twickenham.
Q. Do you know the boy and his father and his brother - A. Yes, I met the boy and his brother in a back lane, behind a linen draper's shop, about four o'clock in the morning that the bacon was lost; that Lane leads from the common, to the Town of Twickenham, they were coming as if from Ives's house, his house is on the common; they had something with them; I cannot tell what they came athwart the road towards their home. I did not see them go into their father's house, I saw them within fifty yards of their father's house, I heard a door shut afterwards, I am sure it was this lad and his brother that I saw.
REBECCA - I live at Twickenham, at Mr. Somerset's house.
Q. Whose handkerchief is that - A. I believe it is

                  Somerset

            . I am a constable of Twickenham, I apprehended the prisoners, I looked up the chimney and saw something in a sack; I said go and fetch a chimney-sweeper, 
               
                  George 
                  Somerset
               



             said he would fetch it down; he put his foot on the hob, and took it down, and said, whose is that, and while I was doing that the younger boy took two pieces into the privy. 
               
                  George 
                  Somerset
               



             then said to Ives, now I hope George you are satisfied you have found your bacon; and coming from the magistrate he kicked up a row, and told the little boy to throw his shoes off, and run away. This is the piece that came out of the chimney.
Prosecutor. I know that piece it was in the house the night before.

            . I live in Cow-Cross


; on the 25th of March, between five and six at Night, I saw the Prisoner put his Hand up to the Rail, and take a Pump off; the Pump was put upon the Rail in the Window for a Show; I followed him and saw him throw the Pump down. It is marked with my Mark; I never lost Sight of him till I took him; he run prodigious fast, that I had much ado to over-take him: He said, What did I run after him for? he knew nothing of the Matter; and he said the same before the Justice. As I came back with the Boy, one of Neighbours who had picked the Pump up gave it to me. I had lost a Pair of Pumps just before.
The Constable. This is the Pump which Mr George gave to me.
Prisoner. I am between twelve and thirteen Years of Age, and used to go to work with my Uncle, who plies all the the tage Stairs, he is a Watchman; I know nothing of what they charge me with. 

               Guilty

HENRY BARNES. On the evening of the 10th of July, I was walking towards Temple-bar


. I felt a person's hand in my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, putting it into his bosom. I seized him, called the watchman, and gave charge of him - he threw it down as I seized him. I took it up, and gave it to the watchman - it was in my hand not ten minutes before - no other person was near.
Prisoner. Q. Was it not possible for it to have fallen from your pocket? A. It was possible.

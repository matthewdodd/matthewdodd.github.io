            , Potter. On Friday Night between 6 and 7, going up Fish-street-hill


 with the Cloth, I pitched it upon a Bulk at the Olive Tree, an Oil-shop. The Prisoner came up and asked me if I had seen a Boy come out of that Shop. I answered, No. The Rascal, says he, has got the Key of the Door. - Do so much as step to the Cross-Keys-Inn, and ask for a Hamper directed for Mr. Jackson, that is my Name, and I keep this House. I'll take Care of your Bundle the while, and give ye Three-pence now, and Three-pence when you come back. So he gave me Three-pence, and I left the Cloth on the Bulk, but when I returned he was gone. After a long Enquiry, and describing him to several People, I heard that such a Person who used to follow such Practices, lodged at a Barber's Shop in Rose-and-Crown Court in Moorfields, and there I found him, and am positive that he is the Man, for I saw him plainly by the Light of the Evening, and a Light in an Apothecary's Shop. The Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

            . I am clerk
 to 
               
                  
                     Robert 
                     Hucks 
                  



                
            , Esq
; his dwelling house is in Leicester-Fields, but his brewhouse is in Dukestreet, Bloomsbury


, and my apartment is there. There is only I and Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Hucks 
               



            , my master's kinsman, that lie there. We have two bedchambers there; mine is in the brewhouse, and his joining to the brewhouse. I had been out all the afternoon. On the 11th of January
 I came home about nine at night, when I found my apartment broke open, and the things laid in the indictment gone (mentioning them). They were taken out of a box and clothes press. They were neither of them locked before. The window to my room, which is about fifteen or sixteen feet from the ground, had twelve pains of glass in it, four of them were broke, and the frame that contained them, which made a hole in the sash big enough for a man to get through. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             and got bills printed, and the next day, about twelve o'clock, one of his constables and a pawnbroker came to my house with my Pompadour suit of clothes, when they ordered me to attend at Sir John's by five. I did, and swore to them; there was the prisoner.
Q. Did you know him before?
Robinson. Yes. He had worked at our brew-house about three years ago. We got a search-warrant the next morning and searched his lodging, which was but about two hundred yards from the brewhouse. There we found the remainder of my clothes.
Q. How do you think he got to your window?
Robinson. I found a ladder upon a parapet wall, which was taken from the new building. The ladder stood about five or six yards from the window, from the ladder he might get to a leaden gutter which joins my window.

            . I made Mr. Robinson's bed on the 11th of January, about seven in the evening, then I made that window fast, which was then whole, and about nine, when Mr. Robinson missed his things, I went and saw the window was broke as he has described it, and one of the shutters was pushed open.

            . I am servant to a pawnbroker. On the 12th of January, about noon, the prisoner brought this suit of clothes, and offered them to pawn. We asked him whose they were; he said, they were his brother's, who was very ill in Middlesex hospital. We asked him what he wanted upon them, and what was the value of them; he said he did not know the value. I had received the bill from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's. I found this suit of Pompadour clothes in the bill. I stopt him, and took him into the parlour. Then he said a man, not his brother, sent him with them. Then I took him to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, and after that went to the prosecutor's, who owned the clothes. ( Produced and deposed to.)

            . I keep the taphouse at Esquire Hucks's brewhouse. On the night Mr. Robinson was robbed he called me up into his room. I saw it was broke as he has mentioned, I was before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             the next day, when the prisoner was there. I saw the constable take a key from him. He said it was the key of his lodgings, but would not tell where his lodgings were. He said his wife was sick at the Middlesex hospital. I went, and by her found the prisoner's lodgings was at the house of one M'Cardell, in Church-street, St. Gyles's; we went there, and the constable unlocked the door with the key; there we found all the other clothes littered about the room, some in one place and some in another. (Produced in court and deposed to.)

            . I saw the constable (who is not here) open the door with that key which was found upon the prisoner, and saw the clothes found in the room.


                  Eliz.
                   M'Cardell
               



            . The prisoner lodged in my house (a woman hired the room which past for his wife, she is since dead in the hospital,) they had not been in the lodging but little more than a week. The key, that the constable unlocked the door with, is the same that belongs to the lock. The clothes were found in his room.
Q. What is the prisoner?
E. M'Cardell. He went under the denomination of a brewer's servant
.
Prisoner's Defence.
I put my wife in the hospital some days before this happened. I had no fire at home, and no place to get my victuals. I went to a public house; there were two men drinking: one of them I had seen before, but not the other. I drank share of a pot or two of bear along with them. They went away and bid me good night. I had a pennyworth of purl after that; they came again, in about three quarters of an hour, and brought two bundles of clothes. They asked me if I had any place where they could leave their bundles till the morrow; I said I had. I carried them up stairs, and put them into my room. On the morrow one of the men came, and tied up one of the suits of clothes in two handkerchiefs. I thought I would go and carry my wife a little wine. The man asked me if I would take the suit of clothes and pawn them for him; I told him I was too weak, I was not able to carry them. I had laid in bed four days before that, Mrs. M'Cardell knows.
M'Cardell. He had been very ill; it was the goal distemper; he had been in Newgate. He kept his bed a day or two; I cannot say positively how long.
Q. Did he go out on the 11th of January?
M'Cardell. He did, and came home with a parcel at night between nine and ten. He was very dirty and very fatigued, and said he was very tired.
Q. Did any body come with him?
E. M'Cardell. No. I did not see him till he came down to light his candle.
Prisoner. The two men came with me to the door with the clothes, one of them went with me to the pawnbroker's, and bid me go in and pawn them for 30 s. I went in, and asked 30 s. upon them, and they stop me. I do not know where they had the clothes.
Prosecutor. The shirts had been thrown out of the window; they were all dirty.
Q. Do you think one man could break the window, and do it?
Prosecutor. I think one man might, the weight of the things are not so heavy, but one man might carry them with ease.

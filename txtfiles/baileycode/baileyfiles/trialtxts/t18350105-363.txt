THOMAS BATTEN
. I am a watchman of St. Andrew's, Holborn, and have been so for nine years. On Sunday evening, the 4th of January, a horse had fallen down at the end of Farringdon-street, which caused a mob—I saw the prisoner there—I watched and saw him take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket—I immediately seized him—the gentleman turned round also and seized him—I saw him throw the handkerchief from him—I took it up and took him to the watch-house—I found 1s. on him.





JOHN WOODWARD
. I was in Farringdon-street. I felt the prisoner take this handkerchief from my pocket, and saw him throw it down—it is mine.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.†—


Transported for Seven Years.

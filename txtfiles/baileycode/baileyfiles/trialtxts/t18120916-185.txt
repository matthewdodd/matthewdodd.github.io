             BILLINGS, SENIOR. I am a wharfinger


 at Paddington


. My partners are 
               
                  John 
                  Brooks

                  John 
                  Humphrey Billings
               



            , my son. I lost the oats between the 15th and 16th of 
               August. They
             were taken out of our corn-loft. The prisoner worked for us occasionally.

 WILLIAM BUTTERWORTH. On the 16th of August, about half after twelve, I met the prisoner with a sack of oats on his back, just by the Bell, at Paddington. He said, he brought them from Chelsea-reach; he gave thirty shillings for them. I put him in the watchhouse, and sent a man to the wharf, and there was a sack of oats missing at the wharf; and when the prisoner came to the office he confessed that he took the oats from Mr. Billing's wharf.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.

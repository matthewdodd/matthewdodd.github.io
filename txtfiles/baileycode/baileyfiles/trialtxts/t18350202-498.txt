JOSEPH COLLEY
. I am a policeman. On the 10th of December, about ten o'clock, I met the prisoner in Broadway, Westminster—I suspected and took him into custody with this decanter in a handkerchief—I asked what he had got—he said he had got nothing—I told him I did not believe him, and should take him to the station-house—he was sixty or seventy yards from the prosecutor's house.





SUSANNA ROBERTSON
. I am the wife of David Francis Robertson, and live in Portsmouth-street. We keep a picture and glass shop—this is our decanter—it was standing by the side of the window—the fellow one remains in the shop—it could not be reached without coming into the shop.





GEORGE WARD
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the Clerk of the Peace at Westminster—(read)—I remember his being tried—I was a witness against him—he is the same person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

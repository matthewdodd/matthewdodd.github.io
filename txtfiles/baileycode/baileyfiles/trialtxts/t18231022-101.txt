            . I was on Snow-hill, on the 15th of October, and saw the prisoner - he asked me if I wanted a situation - I said Yes I did not know him; he said a gentleman had spoken to him for a servant. I went with him to a public-house; he wrote me a note to the gentleman, and after that, said he would go with me himself, for the gentleman would be in town in about half an hour. I went with him to the Exchange; he told me to wait on the steps until he came back, which he did in a few minutes, and pulled out one or two sovereigns, and asked me for change. I gave him 18 s. and two sixpences - he turned away without giving me the sovereign, and said he would be back in a minute or two, and would give it to me again - he never came at all.

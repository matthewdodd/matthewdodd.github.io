JOHN LOVEY
 and 




JOHN OLIVER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
3rd of February, 1 copper, value 8s., the goods of 



Thomas Jelley; and that the said John Lovey had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM ADAMS
 (police-constable G 184.) I met the two prisoners on Clerkenwell-green, between twelve and one o'clock at noon, on the 3rd of February—Lovey was carrying something in a bag—the other walked alongside of him—I followed them to Red Lion-street, and asked them what they had got—they said, "Look," and I found this copper in the bag, as it is now—when I first saw them I suppose they were 200 yards from the prosecutor's—I asked them where they got this—they said they found it in the ruins—I took them, and found the owner.





THOMAS JELLEY
. I live at No. 30, Little Saffron-hill. This copper (looking at it) is mine—it stood in my yard, which is surrounded by a wall and gates ten feet high—I saw it safe at one o'clock on the 2nd of February—my door was not left open—I cannot tell how they could get this—it was in the yard adjoining my cow-shed.

JURY. Q. In what state was the copper when you saw it last? A. In the state of a copper—not in the state it is in now—it was not fixed—it is now all beaten up.

Lovey's Defence. I was coming across the ruins, and my fellow-prisoner fell over this copper, and I took it up.





JAMES ABBOTT
 (police-constable G 218.) I got this certificate of the prisoner Lovey's conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness—Lovey is the person who was then convicted.

s, at Mill-bank


. The prisoner was a carman
 in our employ. He had a key to lock up his bin. He kept the key in his own possession. On the night of the 8th of January, I broke open the lock of the prisoner's bin. I found therein a wooden can, and a gallon of peppermint. On the next morning, when the prisoner came, the constable searched him, and found three empty quart bottles upon him. We asked him how he came by this peppermint. He said, he thought no harm of taking a drop of drink. His house was searched. We found three bottles there, two of gin, and one containing water.

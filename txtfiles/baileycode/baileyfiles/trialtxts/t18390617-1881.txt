MARY ANN STURMAN
. I live at Mr. Maynard's, in the Curtain-road. On the 1st of June, I was going to the bed-room on the first floor, and found the prisoner, who was a stranger—she had a bundle with her—I asked her who she wanted—she said, Mr. Sims, a chair-maker—I told her to come down, and Mr. Maynard asked her what she had in her bundle—she said a dress—he found this property in it.





THOMAS MAYNARD
. I was at home—when the prisoner was brought down she had this bundle containing this property, partly mine and partly Mr. Booth's—my wife had shawls like these and I believe these are hers, and this handkerchief.





HARRIET BOOTH
. I am the wife of John Booth. I live in that house—these two articles are mine.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

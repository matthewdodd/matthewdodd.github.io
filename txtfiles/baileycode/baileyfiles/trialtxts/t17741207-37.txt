            . On the 15th of November, coming across Fleet-Ditch


, between nine or ten at night, I saw the two prisoners near each other: Duffin laid hold of me, and snatched my handkerchief from my neck; as soon as she snatched it from my neck; she chucked it over to Atkins, who was standing near a gentleman that was passing by, and with assistance, I caught the two prisoners: I afterwards carried them to the watch-house: I am sure, the two prisoners are the persons, I never lost sight of them.
The prisoners, in their defence denied the charge, but produced no evidence.
Q. From the jury.
Q. Was there any girl so near you, that it could be any other person?
Spncer. No. There were but these two.
Both 

               Guilty

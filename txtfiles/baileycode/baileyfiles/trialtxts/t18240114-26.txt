            , who keeps a hosiers shop
 at Holborn bars


. On the 26th of December, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop; my sister and I were there; he asked for a cravat; I shewed him one, which did not suit him, and he left immediately; no other customer was there. I had just come in, and saw a piece of handkerchiefs on the counter, and missed them before he left, and saw them in his hat as he went out. I followed him, calling, Stop thief, but did not lose sight of him, till he was stopped in a court in Castle-street.

(Property produced and sworn to.)

. I went into the garden, and saw the linen which was left hanging there was all gone. I had seen it there over night, the things were taken and brought back, and were there lying upon a dray.

             ran about three hundred yards, and I ran; I was about five yards off the Prisoner when he flung down the linen; there was his apron. We brought him back; he said he did not belong to the linen. I shewed him the apron, he said that was his.

PHILIP WETZELL
 was indicted

for stealing 1 painting and frame, value 3l., the goods of 



John Annis; and that he had been before convicted of felony.

(The prisoner being a foreigner had the evidence communicated to him by an interpreter.)





BENJAMIN HAZELDINE
. I am in the service of Mr. John Annis, a pawnbroker—he lost an oil painting on Wednesday, the 17th of Dec.—this is it—the prisoner had been in the shop five minutes before we missed it.





JOHN LINSCOTT
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 105, High-street, Whitechapel. On the 17th of Dec. this painting was pawned by the prisoner for 10s.—he called again two days afterwards, and offered to sell the duplicate—he was then given into custody.

Prisoner. It is the truth, I went to sell the ticket and was put in charge.





BENJAMIN HAZELDINE

re-examined. This is the painting—it is the property of Mr. John Annis—it was lost from his shop in the Minories, about a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning, and was pawned at Mr. Linscott's between three and four that afternoon.

Prisoner's Defence. A person gave it me; I do not know him by name; if I should see the man I should know him; he was a countryman, he wanted me to pawn it, and he would give me 1s.; being a poor man I went to pawn it;

he gave me a sixpence and left me the ticket; I was in the gentleman's shop and left two gentlemen and one woman in the shop.





BENJAMIN HAZELDINE

re-examined. He offered to pawn a clarionet—there was no other person in the part of the shop where he was—there were other persons, but there is a partition across the shop which parted them.





PATRICK MANNING
 (police-constable H 160.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at this Court—(Read—Convicted on 8th of April. 1844, of burglary, and confined eighteen months)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Ten Years.


Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

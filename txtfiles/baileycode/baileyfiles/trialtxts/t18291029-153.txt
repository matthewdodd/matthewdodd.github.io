CHARLES McPHERSON. I am a woollen-draper
. I was in St. John-street-road


 on the 9th of October, about nine o'clock in the evening; I had a handkerchief in my right-hand coat pocket, and felt it taken - I turned, and saw the prisoner; I seized him, and accused him of taking it - he denied it, but while he was denying it I saw it on the ground, at his feet; this is it.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and have had the handkerchief ever since.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and this gentleman accused me of taking his handkerchief - while he was talking to me I walked a little way back, and he found it on the ground; I said it was not me, for I had been to Mr. Ryder's livery-stable.

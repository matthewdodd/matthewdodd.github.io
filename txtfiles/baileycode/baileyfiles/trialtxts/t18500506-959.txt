MARGARET GREATHEAD
. I am a widow, and a publican of Westminster. On 27th April, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I missed an oil painting and frame from the tap-room—I had seen it safe half an hour before—I saw it again at seven, when the policeman brought the prisoner—this is it—(produced).

Burke. Q. Was I at the bar? A. Yes; about half-past six—you had half a pint of beer, remained about ten minutes, and then went out at the door—Osborne was with you, and another man—Osborne asked me to show her the back yard—she came back in three or four minutes, and had something to drink—she then went out, and I missed the picture.





WILLIAM DRADEY
. I am a carman. I was having some drink, and saw Osborne come out with something under her gown like a picture—she went

towards Broad-street—the prisoner and another man followed her, and they all went into a public-house at the corner of Broad-street—Burke came out with a picture under his arm—I followed him, and told a policeman.





WILLIAM CARR
 (policeman). I took Burke, with this picture tied up in a handkerchief.

Burke's Defence. A man gave me a picture outside.





CHARLES BATTERSLEY
 (police-inspector). I produce a certificate—(read—


Catherine Milen, Convicted, March 18th, 1849, on her own confession, and confined eight months)—I was present—Osborne is the person.

            . I live in Chapel-street


, just opposite Mr. Puttock's. On the 22nd of March, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking in at the window - I saw him snatch an apron off the eggs in the shop, and run away; I saw him running, but could not catch him - I had seen him several times before, and knew him perfectly well; I saw him in custody the next day.

            . I apprehended the prisoner in a yard, among a parcel of boys - I knew him well by the description given of him; when he saw me he ran into a house, and tried to hide himself - I took him, and he said,"What do you want?" I said, "You will soon know," and as we went along he said, "I know nothing about the apron;" I had not mentioned an apron.
PETER PUTTOCK. I was at home, and missed the apron, but did not see it taken.

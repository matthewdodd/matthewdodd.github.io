SAMUEL THOMAS
. I am servant to William Tent, of Birchin-lane. On the 28th of July the two prisoners came to the shop—Riley asked to look at a pair of stockings at 1s.—I said we had none under 2s.—he said they would do—I showed them to him—he said they would do—I put them in paper—he gave me a half-sovereign to pay for them—I went to get change at the till—I saw Jeffreys move this scarf, which was on the counter, and put it into an umbrella—I said I had no change—they both said it was of no consequence, they would call for them as they came back—they both went out of the shop—I followed them, and asked them both to come back—I said I wanted to speak to them—they came back to the shop, put down the umbrella in the corner, sat down, and both said, "You can search me"—I took hold of the umbrella, and one took hold of it, then

both took hold of it—they wanted to turn it upside-down, and let the scarf out—I held the top of it tight till the policeman came and found it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where were you? A. Behind the counter, and looking straight at them—I was quite close to them—I watched them.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. They came back quite willingly? A. Yes—I do not recollect which said, "Search me" first-Jeffreys had the umbrella all the while—Riley did not say, "Don't strike him, send for a policeman"—I will swear he said nothing of the kind—Riley came in first—the half-sovereign was found in his mouth at the station.





CHARLES JOHN CLAXTON
. I am shopman at a shop there. I saw the two prisoners and Thomas struggling with the umbrella—I called the officer, and saw him find this scarf in it.

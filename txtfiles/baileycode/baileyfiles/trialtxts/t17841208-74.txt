             stopped the prisoner in the passage, he was running, and was the only man that came up the passage at that time; there was nothing on him then; the court is a thoroughfare.
Prisoner. I went to the Cross Keys to enquire for the Chatham stage, and I crossed the way, and there was a cry of stop thief, and a man stopped me; I am a shoemaker, I worked with one Mr. Watts, in Oyster-street, Portsmouth, I had been come to town but a fortnight, trade is dead there, and I heard of a master at Chatham, one Mr. Trott.

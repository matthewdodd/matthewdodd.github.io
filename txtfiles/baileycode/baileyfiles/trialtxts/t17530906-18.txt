            . I keep a publick house
 in the parish of Kensington


: last Sunday we miss'd a silver punch ladle.
Q. When had you seen it last?
Harper. I had not seen it for a week before: the socket of the ladle, was found upon the prisoner by 
               
                  Ratcliff 
                  Littler 
               



            , and deliver'd to me. He was taken before justice Fielding, and there he own'd he took it out of my house in a drunken frolick in my hearing.
Ratcliff Littler. I am a comrade in the same regiment with the prisoner. On the 3d of Sept. I and the prisoner were together; he said his master had lost a punch ladle, and said he talk'd of going to the cunning man, and he suspects me: I said if he goes to the cunning devil, I'll go with him. We went to drink, he pull'd out some money, and with it the socket of this ladle; I kept that, and took him before justice Fielding, and then went for his landlord, (he looks at it, and says this is the bit I took from him.) He own'd he sold the other part for 9 s. and that he took it out of his landlord's cupboard.
The prisoner had nothing to say for himself.

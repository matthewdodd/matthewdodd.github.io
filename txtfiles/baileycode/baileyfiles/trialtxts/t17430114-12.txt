                  Fido 
               



             . On Monday the 27th of December, between the Hours of four and five at Night, I was going into the Choir, and heard somebody call Mr Fido; I went to see what was the Matter, and saw 
               
                  Robert 
                  Hillier 
               



             have hold of the Prisoner with one Hand, and this Common-Prayer Book in the other: I carried her before Justice Manley. - She did not own, or deny it; she said, she could not tell what was in her to do it, she thought she was out of her Senses. - It belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster; I saw it on the Dean's Cushion about five Minutes before. - I am Verger to the Dean and Chapter.

             . On the 27th of December, between four and five o'Clock, after the Candles were put out, I was standing at the Choir Door, waiting for Mr Fido; the Prisoner wanted to come by me; seeing something in her Apron that looked like a Book, I asked her what she had got in her Apron; she said, nothing belonging to me: Said I, let me see what you have; she was unwilling I should, so I took this Book out of her Apron. I believe she was in real Want, for she said, she came out of the Workhouse but a very little before.

WILLIAM TAYOR
. I am a soda-water manufacturer at Walworth—I lost my coat of the front of my cart in the square, leading from New-Compton-street to Seven Dials—I was absent from my cart about a minute and a half, and was told the coat was gone—I turned round the corner and caught sight of the prisoner, and shortly after he turned the second corner, I took him with the coat in his possession—he said, "What was a family to do starving?"—I said, "I thought there was work for him, if he tried to get it."
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I work at the water-said, but could get nothing to do.




GUILTY
. Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years.

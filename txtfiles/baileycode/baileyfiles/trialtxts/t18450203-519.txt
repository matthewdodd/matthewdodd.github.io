THOMAS HILL
 and 




WILLIAM SMITH
 were indicted for

 stealing 4 glass bottles, value 1s.; 1 quart of pickles, 9d.; and 1 pint of soy, 1s.; the goods of 



John James Brook; and that Hill had been before convicted of felony.






MARGARET BROOK
. I am the wife of John James Brook. About five o'clock, on the 16th of Jan., I was in my back parlour—Sheen came and asked if I had lost anything—I ran across the road, and caught hold of the prisoner Hill—I said, "1 think you have got my pickles"—he said, have not"—I gave him to the policeman—there was nothing found on him—I missed four bottles of pickles, which I had seen safe about three o'clock.





ALLAN SHEEN
. On the 16th of Jan. I was looking out of window, and

saw the prisoners standing together, for nearly an hour, by a barber's shop, three doors from Mr. Brook's—I then saw Hill go in and take something off a shelf at Mr. Brook's—he went out and spoke to Smith, then went back to Mr. Brook's, took a glass bottle, and crossed again to Smith—I think Hill crossed about half a dozen times to Mr. Brook's—Smith then went away, and I went and told.





JULIA SHEEN
 I was with my sister—I saw the prisoners together for about a quarter of an hour, looking into a shop—I saw Hill take the bottles, cross the road, and give them to Smith—Hill crossed again, and Smith ran down a street, and said, "You are caught, you are caught."





WILLIAM KEELEY
 (police-constable K 175.) I produce a certificate of Hill's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Con-victed, 18th September, 7th of Victoria, and confined one year.)

            . I live in York-street, Mary-le-bone


, and am a stationer
. On the 12th of December I was at tea in the parlour, my shop door was open, and I saw a tall young man looking into the window - I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner run out with something in his hand - I ran out, and saw him drop the till about five yards off; I immediately stopped him; it contained about 6s. in copper, which was picked up in the street - I am positive he is the man.(Till produced and sworn to.)

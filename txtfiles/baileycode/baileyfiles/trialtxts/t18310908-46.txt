JOHN THOMAS CATHOLIC. I am a mathematical-case maker. On the 6th of August, a little after two o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in company together - I watched them, and saw Davis go to Mr. Ward's shop, on Back-hill


, and come back; he went a second time, and came back again - he went a third time, covered the writing-desk over, which was on the outside of the shop, and took it away - Watson was at that time at the corner of Christopher-street, and Davis gave him the desk; I saw this out of a window; I went down, and took Watson with the desk, which he threw down; Davis walked away - I called Stop thief! and he was taken.

            . I was not at home: I returned just as the prisoners were taken - this is my desk.
WILLIAM REYNOLDS. I am an officer, and took the prisoners.
Watson put in a written Defence, stating that the desk was never in his possession, and that he had no knowledge of Davis.

ALLEN WINTLE SMITH
. I live in Red Lion-street, Holborn, and am a shoemaker. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, on the 3rd of May, I was in the parlour at the back of my shop—I saw the prisoner in the shop—I saw him take two pounds of leather off a nail, wrap it up, and put it under his coat—the leather produced is mine—it is marked—part of it was cut up.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He threw it back into the shop, I believe? A. Yes, after he got outside—a person named Thomas, a shoemaker, has part of the shop, and I have the other part—we are not partners in the business, only in the shop—it was my leather the prisoner took.





JOHN COLEBY
. My master called me, and I saw the prisoner with the leather under his coat, outside the door—I asked him what he wanted—he asked if there was a man named Harris lived there—I told him no—he then threw the leather back.





LUKE NIXON
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

PETER BEWS. I am superintendant of the Refuge for the Destitute, at Shoreditch




; the prisoner was an inmate
, and had been there four months. On Sunday, the 24th of May, about five o'clock in the morning, he made his escape, taking with him a jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers,which were worn by another person. I have the care of them. I got an officer, between eight and nine o'clock at night, and found him at his mother's, in Little Gray's Inn-lane - He had left his own clothes behind - I brought him back, and made him take them off - They were quite new.

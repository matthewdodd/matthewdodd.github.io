            . I have a place at Hoxton



, a printing-shop and dye-house
; I left it, and went to Wandsworth, and left the keys with Mr. Brickinshire, about a fortnight ago; I had word somebody had got into my dye-house, and cut some of the coppers and cocks; I went, and found the coppers had been cut, so that they must be made use of as old copper, and the cocks cut off.

                  Brickinshire 
               



            . I live at Hoxton, and am a brickmaker; last Saturday was a fortnight, in the afternoon, I was paying my men, and Denham that works for me, came and said, there are two men cutting the coppers with a hatchet; I took some of my men, and went in order to catch them; when we came to the end of the garden, one of the boys said, the men are run away; we set out after them round the field, and one of them had hid himself in a ditch of water, that was the evidence; he was asked, what he wanted there; he said he was a bird's-nesting; I took him before Justice Palmer; there Denham swore he was one of them; then he confessed all the fact; his name is Gregory.

                  Denham 
               



            . I looked through a hole in the dye-house, and saw the prisoner and evidence knocking at the copper; I said, halloo; they said the same; they opened the door and ran away; I ran and told Mr. Brickinshire of them.

                  Gregory 
               



            . The prisoner was along with me at the place where these things were cut off, in order to carry away to sell; we knocked the cocks off with the poker, which was in the dye-house.
Prisoner's defence.
Gregory did it all himself, and said, if I did not help him to get a good load, he would knock me down with the poker: I was in the copper at the time he was knocking it; I never was concerned in my life before I was with him; he said he had got so good a friend, that would save him, let him do what he will; he called me out of my house to go with him.

            . I live at No. 9, Nag's Head court, Gracechurch street, my husband is a taylor. On Saturday morning, about ten o'clock, I was going down Wood street


, I saw the prisoner come to the tail of the waggon and move a bale which was in the waggon; I stepped back a little, I saw the prisoner draw the bale out on his left shoulder and walk away with it; about the space of two yards from the tail of the waggon it slipped off his shoulder, a man jumped out of a passagethat goes to a public house, and lifted it on his shoulder again; upon which the prisoner went on; I stepped up to the carman, I told him the man had taken a bale out of his waggon; I said there is the man going with it; I pointed out the man; upon which the prisoner was taken.

            . I am a carman to Mr. Pickford, the Castle inn, Wood street. On the 11th of February, we loaded Mr. Pickford's cart; we drawed the cart out of the Castle inn, into Wood street; I gave one truss off to my partner, to deliver in Little Love lane; I was in Wood street, going to draw into Lad lane; this good lady informed me that a man had taken a truss off the cart; I pursued him round the corner into Maiden lane and laid hold of the man with the truss upon his shoulder; the moment I laid hold of him by the breast he dropped the truss and attempted to escape; I did not let him go away, he was taken into the Castle yard, Wood street.

            . I am a constable; I produce the wrapper; I took the prisoner to the Compter; I came back again, and put a mark on the truss. The truss was taken before the magistrate; it contained twist and buttons; the contents were agreeable to the invoice.

Q. What did the truss contain - A. Sixty four bags of buttons, and upwards of thirty seven pounds weight of twist; the whole was worth about an hundred pounds; it was coming to me. It came from Leek in Staffordshire.
Prisoner's Defence. As I was going down Wood street, a man asked me which way I was going; I told him down Barbican; he put it on my back; he told me he would satisfy me; I carried it down Maiden lane; the carman came and laid hold of me by the collar, and said I had his property. I did not see where he got it from; he had a white apron on, and apparently a fustain jacket. I live at No. 2, Bell court, Bell alley.

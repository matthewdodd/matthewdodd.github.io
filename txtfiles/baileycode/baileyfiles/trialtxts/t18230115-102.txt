             Bensted, linen-draper
, of Little Bath-street, Cold Bath-square


. On Monday, the 23d of December, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at some shawls - another person was serving in the shop. I shewed her some - she bought none; she was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I went to the window, to reach her some smaller patterns, as she said they were too large - some cotton lay on the counter. The smaller patterns did not suit her; two females came with her, and they all left the shop together. While I was at the window, I turned round to ask them a question, and from the prisoner's actions, I suspected she was taking something; she had put her hand in her pocket. I went after her, and about four yards from the shop, she pulled the cotton from under her coat, and threw it on the ground.
Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. One of them went outside to point something out to you - A. Yes.

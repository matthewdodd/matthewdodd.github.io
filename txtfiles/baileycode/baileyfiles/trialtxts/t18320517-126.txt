            . I was left in charge of Lord St. German's house, when Sir John Trevillion left it; the prisoner was known to Sir John, and I allowed her, at her request, to remain in the house - I put some books on the sofa in the back drawing-room; she had access to every part of the house, and was frequently left in the house alone - she remained there till March.

            . I am assistant to a pawnbroker in Berwick-street. I produce ten or twelve books, some of which I took in of the prisoner in February and March, in the name of Allen; we asked if they were her own - she said Yes, and gave her address at No.32, Wardour-street.

            . I have no knowledge of the prisoner, and was not aware that she was in my house - I had left Holmes in charge; some of these books have my arms in them, and I had such as the others in my library, and have missed them.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the property -I was not left more than two or three hours at a time.

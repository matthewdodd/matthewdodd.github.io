            . I am a grocer in Whitechapel




: the Prisoner is my servant
 to carry out goods. On the 6th of February he took two shillings out of the till. - I had marked eight shillings and some half-crowns, the night before, with the letter M, and put them into the till (I had missed a shilling out of the till some time before, but I would not take any notice of that.) The Prisoner went twice by the drawer, and each time he took out a shilling.
Q. How do you know the Prisoner took them out?
Miller. I went to the till, and found two of the shillings I had marked missing: then I called him into a little room at the end of the shop, and told him of it. - I said, I must come to the truth of it; and sent for a constable. I told him, the Prisoner had taken 2 s. from me. He searched him, and found the 2 s. two Queen's Anne's shillings, marked on the neck with the letter M, in his shoes. I marked them with a pair of iron tweezers. I had put them into the till but about a quarter of an hour before.

            . Mr. Miller sent for me, and told me, the Prisoner had robbed him of two shillings. I desired, if he had done it, he would confess, and ask his master's pardon. He denied it a great while, but at last took them out of his shoes, and then Mr. Miller charged me with him.

            . I live in Redcross-square, Barbican. On the 14th of March, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the bottom of King-street, near Guildhall


, on the last day of the election. I felt a great push behind me, turned round, and saw the prisoner about five yards from me. I collared him, and saw him drop my handkerchief from under his apron. I picked it up, and gave him in charge.

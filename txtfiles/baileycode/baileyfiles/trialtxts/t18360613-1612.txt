 and 




JOHN NEEHAN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
23rd of May, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



David Bean, from his person; and that Neehan had been before convicted of felony.






DAVID BEAN
. On the 23rd of May, I was at Greenwich fair, and had my pocket picked—I did not feel it done, or see any body—Dyke told me of it, and produced my handkerchief.





WILLIAM DYKE
. I am a policeman. I attended the fair—I observed the two prisoners following the prosecutor up and down the fair—I saw Freeman go behind him and take the handkerchief from his pocket—Neehan was close behind him, covering him—I immediately took them into custody, and took the handkerchief from Freeman's hand, as he drew it from the pocket—I secured them both—I had seen them together for nearly an hour—in company and acting together—I searched them—I found nothing but a pair of kid gloves and a knife on Neehan, and 2d. on Freeman—it was four or five o'clock in the afternoon.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





JAMES HAYWOOD
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the conviction of Neehan, which I received at Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was present at the trail—he is the person who was convicted.

Freeman's Defence. We had not been in the fair a quarter of an hour before we were taken.

Neehan's Defence. I was standing by at the time the policeman laid hold of him, he laid hold of me afterwards, and said we had been picking pockets together.

FREEMAN—


GUILTY

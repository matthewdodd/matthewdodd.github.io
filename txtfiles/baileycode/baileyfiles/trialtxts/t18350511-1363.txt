CORNELIUS DONAGHUE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
25th of April, 5 shawls, value 25s., the goods of

SAMUEL WITHERS
—I am in the employ of Mr. John Shayler, who lives in the Borough—on the 25th of April, at a quarter before nine o'clock, I was in

the shop—I saw the prisoner and a lesser lad at the window—I heard a conversation between them; the lesser lad said to the prisoner, "See, we can nail these shawls"—there were some shawls inside the shop, and they were looking in at the door—I looked at them—they saw me, and went away—I stood outside the counter for about twenty minutes—I then turned my back, and heard a cord snap—I saw the shawls disappearing round the window—I ran out and saw the prisoner throw these shawls down—I ran up a yard next to our house and saw the prisoner; I collared him, and brought him back with the shawls—he begged to be forgiven—these are the shawls.





JOHN HOLEHAN
 (police-constable M 90.) I took the prisoner, and have the shawls.

Prisoner. I had occasion to turn up the archway, and some gentleman came and took me to the shop; and as we were going in, this witness came out of the shop, and said, "That is one."





SAMUEL WITHERS
. No; he was running up the yard when I took him myself, and brought him back—I can swear he dropped the shawls, but he was some distance from them when I took him.




GUILTY
. † Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On Saturday the 5th of May, between four and five in the afternoon, I was returning from settling an account with a merchant in Thames-street. I was gone into a house; soon after Mr. Mosely came in, and said, You have had your pocket picked. I said, if it was, it is a silk handkerchief. I had not missed it; I felt, and missed it. He said, when you was turning to go into this house, I saw this man take your handkerchief out of your pocket; he had the prisoner and handkerchief with him. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)

            . I was walking behind this gentleman in Thames-street


; as he was turning into the house; I perceived the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and take something out, I could not tell what; he took it by the corner, and gave it a fling cut; then I saw it to be a handkerchief. I ran after him; he ran on to the Tower-ditch. When I was within a yard of him he flung it into the ditch. I had him held till I got down and got it; then I brought him back to Mr. Bristow with the handkerchief.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know no more about it than the child unborn. I was going to go on board a ship, and he called stop thief, and charged me with picking this gentleman's pocket.

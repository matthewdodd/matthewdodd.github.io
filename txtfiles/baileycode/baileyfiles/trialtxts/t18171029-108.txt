            , who is a haberdasher
. On the 25th of October, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked the price of a check shirt which hung in the window; he said he wanted four - I told him I had only that one; he went away, and returned, saying, he would have some cloth cut for some, and get them made where he lived, which, he said, was opposite; he looked out another shirt, a silk handkerchief, a pair of stockings, a pair of braces, and seven yards and a half of check, and desired me to make a bill, and he would pay me, while I was making the bill he scrambled them all up together, except the check, and ran out with them; I gave the alarm, and sent to the watch-house - He was pursued and taken in a ditch. I am positive he is the man.
ROBERT SHEARMAN. The prosecutor gave the alarm; the people said the prisoner had ran up Weight-street, I went through there into the East India-road-when he saw me he jumped into a ditch - I got him out, and found the bundle in his bosom. I secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a carpet-manufacturer
, and live in Union-street, Borough. On the 27th of May I was coming from Throgmorton-street


, and at the corner of the Auction Mart I was told my pocket had been picked. I felt, and missed my handkerchief. A gentleman pointed the prisoner out, I went to him, and asked if he had got my handkerchief? he said No, the other boy had it. I saw no other boy, secured him, and saw the handkerchief found in his bosom.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was in Throgmorton-street, and saw Mr. Denby with the prisoner behind him. I did not see him take the handkerchief, but saw him put one into his jacket. He crossed towards the Bank, I pointed him to Denby. I took him to the Mansion House, and saw the handkerchief found on him.

            . I am a Custom-house officer. I was on Fish-street-hill


, and saw the prisoner and another lad walking before Mr. Sentance; I saw the other put his hand towards Mr. Sentance's pocket, and look into it; after walking a few paces he took the handkerchief out, and gave it to the prisoner, who was in his company and talking to him: Mr. Sentance turned down Eastcheap, and the two boys ran away; I informed Mr. Sentance, then ran after the prisoner, and took the handkerchief out of his trousers pocket: he denied having it; but when I found it, he said he had picked it up.
WILLIAM SENTANCE. I live in Blackman-street. On the 1st of August the witness gave me information - I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; I afterwards saw it in King's possession.

Prisoner's Defence (written) On the day previous to the robbery, I was going along Fish-street-hill, a boy came up to me and asked me whether I would be so kind as to pawn a handkerchief; he pulled it out of his side pocket; I asked him where he got it from - he said it was his mother's; while I was in the act of pledging the handkerchief I was taken into custody, and the boy made his escape.

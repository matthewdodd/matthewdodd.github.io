BAYLEY

WILLIAM HENRY CROSS
. I am shopman to Messrs. Tapper and Son woollen drapers, of No. 74, Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday, 13th Feb., the prisoners came to our shop, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I did not know them before—they asked me to show them some black cloth to make an over coat—I cannot say which spoke first—I showed them several pieces—the tailor especially examined the cloths; I mean Cracknell—he selected the piece, and told me to cut off a quantity sufficient to make a coat—they selected satin for a waistcoat, some doe skin, for trowsers, and some material for trimmings; the articles came to 3l. 16s.—Cracknell told me to pack the parcel up, that he was going into the City, and would call for the parcel on his return—he then left the shop, leaving Jackson there—I packed up the goods, and made out the bill—I gave Jackson the bill, and he gave me a 10l. note—I asked him to write his name on it, and he wrote "J. Smith," and gave the note to me—I asked him for his address, and wrote it myself; it was Bridge-street, Hoxton—there was a number, but I forget it now—I

gave the note to the cashier; this (produced) is it—I got a 5l. note from the cashier, and 1l. 4s. in money, which I gave to Jackson, and he left the shop—about half an hour afterwards, Cracknell called for the parcel; I gave it him, and asked him for his address; he gave me the address of "Cracknell, Enfield"—he took the parcel away with him—I solicited his favours for the future, and told him we should be very glad to do business with him; he said he would do so.

Cross-examined by
MR. SLEIGH. Q. I believe he took away something else besides the parcel, did not he? A. Yes, a little commission, which we are in the habit of allowing—he represented himself as a tailor, and selected the goods for the other man as a customer; that is the custom of tailors.





CHARLES CRACKNELL
. I live at Enfield Town, and have done so about twenty-five years—there are several persons of my name living at Enfield—I never saw or knew the prisoner, Cracknell—he does not live at Enfield to my knowledge; if he had lived at Enfield in the name of Cracknell I should have known it—the Cracknells that I know living at Enfield are market gardeners—I am a tailor—there is no other tailor of my name living at Enfield.

Cross-examined. Q. You know all the other Cracknells of Enfield intimately, do you? A. Yes, every one of them; there are four or five—they are not related to me—I do not profess to extend my knowledge to their relations—I gave a list of the other Cracknells to the officer.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. That was a list of the persons you knew? A. Yes—the prisoner was not one of them—there is no other tailor at Enfield except myself.





HEPHZIBAH MARKHAM
. I am a widow—I keep a hosier's shop at No. 16, Jewin-street, and am a niece of the prisoner, Cracknell. On 10th Feb., between 10 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon, Cracknell came to my shop with Jackson—Cracknell said the person with him was going to Australia, and was wanting something in my way—Cracknell went up stairs to see my mother, his sister; she was then on a visit at my hous—while he was up stairs, Jackson purchased some goods; I cannot recollect all of them; there was some hosiery and handkerchiefs; they came to 1l. 2s. 2 1/2 d.—he said he was going to Australia, and what he was purchasing he should be wanting—Cracknell afterwards came down stairs into the shop, and went to Jackson—I put the articles he had purchased into paper, and gave them to Jackson, and he produced what appeared to be a 5l. Note—I asked him if he had not got change; he said, "No, he had not"—Cracknell was present at the time—I told Eliza Varley, my assistant, to go and get change—she was not gone long—she returned with change—I gave Jackson four sovereigns, and he gave me half a crown; that was in Cracknell's presence—on the following Friday, the note was returned to me by Miss Vickress, marked "forged" all over—this is it (produced)—on receiving the note from Miss "Vickress, I went with her and another friend to No. 3, King-street, Commercial-road East, where Cracknell lived—we went in and saw him—I asked him if he could tell me anything of the person that was with him, that gave me the note—he took a written note from his pocket, and said he knew nothing of him any further than he had received this note—this is the note he produced—(Read: "London, Feb. 13, '55. Sir—You will please to deliver my parcel at the Star Coffee-house, Drury-lane, on Monday, before 5 o'clock, and I will leave the money there. Yours, etc., G. Parkins. To Mr. Cracknell, King-street, Commercial-road. "Addressed, "To Mr. Cracknell, tailor and draper, No. 3, King-street, Commercial-road, George's-in—the East, London")—he said that he

knew nothing further of him, but that that was where he had to take the clothes to; upon that I returned home—in the course of the same afternoon, Cracknell called upon me—he said he was very sorry it had happened; that he had got quite the amount of goods in his possession; and I should not be the loser by the note—he said the goods belonged to the party that came with him, or something to that effect—he then left, and returned again in the evening, and we went to Miss Vickress—I took 5l. With me—I gave that to Mr. Vickress, and received this note in exchange—Cracknell and I parted at the door of Mr. Vickress, and went different ways—on the following Monday, I went to Drury-lane in company with a friend named Friend—I went there to receive the money for the note—Monday was the time appointed by this note, and I went in accordance with that suggestion—I found Cracknell there; he was standing at the corner of some street—there was no such place as the Star coffee-house—we walked about for some time; half an hour or more, perhaps—I saw Cracknell and his brother; the brother had a bundle, and there was another man named Lancaster with them—Cracknell said they had been looking for the Star coffee house, and could not find such a place, and he could not do anything further than to give me the clothes—I went with Mr. Friend and them to a public-house, and Cracknell put the clothes in a parcel, and gave them to us—upon receiving the clothes, Mr. Friend drew up this paper for me to give to Cracknell—(read: "Received of Mr. Cracknell, two coats, and two pairs of trowsers, for money due, and if not called for in a fortnight shall become my property. For H. Markham. John Friend. 19th Feb., 1855."—I gave that to Cracknell, and the forged note—I think his brother had the forged note in his possession at the time—I saw him give it to Cracknell—1 had given it to his brother the evening before—on the Tuesday, in the following week, I saw Moss, the police-officer—in consequence of what I learnt from him, I went next day, Wednesday, to the Police Court, and there saw Cracknell in charge—Moss has the clothes which I received from Cracknell's brother.

Cross-examined. Q. Cracknell is your uncle? A. Yes; he is a tailor by trade, and his brother also—I have known the prisoner all my life—until within the last six or eight months, he was carrying on business as a tailor, on his own account—I do not know whether he was working for any firm—when he came to my house, he was residing in King street, Commercial-road, with his wife—previously to that, he lived in St. Mary-axe, I think—his brother did not live with him—I do not know whether King-street is near Mr. Matthews's; I did not know King-street before I went that day—I have heard my uncle say that he had been in the employ of a Mr. Matthews for the last several months; that is all I know of it—I do not know that there was any person but myself in my shop at the time the prisoner came, with the exception of my assistant; there might be, I do not know; she was not present all the time—I was in the shop the whole of the time; I am perfectly clear that Cracknell was in the shop at the time the 5l. note was paid—he had gone up stairs while Jackson was selecting the goods—Cracknell was in the shop when I sent my assistant out with the note for change—he was in the shop before I had done serving Jackson—I did not observe, when Jackson took out the note, whether he had any more notes with him—I did not observe where he took it from—when I went to King-street, I found my uncle alone; he was at work making up clothes; it was there he showed me the written note, and said he knew nothing more of the man, than that was where he was to take the clothes—

the day I went to Drury-lane was the day mentioned in this note—Cracknell and his brother were there, and one of them had the clothes with him; Mr. Lancaster was there when we met them—I have never heard any imputation upon my uncle's character for honesty and integrity.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you had very little knowledge of him? A. I have always been living in the country up to the last two years—I was not intimate with him for the last six months; I knew him very well before—I had heard him say he was living in King-street—I believe he formerly kept a tailor's shop in St. Mary axe—I have been there—I have known him since I have been in London, two years; I knew he was carrying on his business—I knew nothing further of him—I had had no dealings with him.





ELIZA VARLEY
. I am assistant to Mrs. Markham, On Saturday, 10th Feb., I remember the two prisoners coming to her shop—I saw Jackson lay a note on the counter—Mrs. Markham told me, in Cracknell's presence, to go and change the note—I went it to vickress's, gave it to Miss Vickress, and she gave me change—I took the change to Mrs. Markham, and she gave it to Jackson—I am certain that the note I gave to Miss Vickress was the one I received from Mrs. Markham.





MARY ANN VICKRESS
. I am the niece of Mr. Thomas Vickress, a wine merchant, of No. 45, Aldersgate-street. On 10th Feb. a 5l. note was handed to me by the barmaid, in Varley's presence—this is it—I wrote on it, "Markham, No. 16, Jewin-street, 10—2—55"—I placed it in the desk, and handed the change to the barmaid, who passed it to the bar—the note was afterwards paid into the bank with other money, and was afterwards returned to me, stamped "forged," as it is now—I afterwards accompanied Mrs. Markham to King-street, Commercial-road; we found Cracknell there—Mrs. Markham asked him if he knew anything of the party that had given her the note—he said he knew nothing more of him than that he had been working for him, and he believed he was going to Australia; or, he did not know whether he was gone—I said it was strange that he should take a party, of whom he knew nothing, to get a note changed with his niece—he said that he never hesitated in taking money himself from people that he knew nothing of, and never saw again, if it was in the way of business—he produced this note, and said that was all he knew of the man; he had received that communication from the party he was working for, and he was to leave the clothes at the Star coffee house.





JOHN FRIEND
. I am a draper, at Bromley, near Bow. In Feb. last, I accompanied Mrs. Markham to Drury-lane, in search of the Star coffee house; I do not remember the day—I wrote this receipt in a public house in Drury-lane for Mrs. Markham, at her request—I understood Cracknell to say that the prisoner Jackson was not forthcoming, and he would recompense her for the loss if he had the money; but as he had not the money, he would deposit the goods with her until such time as he had the money to give her—that was what I understood him to say; but it is only from recollection—I felt no interest in the case—I heard nothing said about an accomplice.





HENRY FUTCHER
. I am shopman to Mr. Winder, a hosier, of No. 104, High-street, Shoreditch. On Friday evening, 9th Feb., about 6 o'clock or half past, the two prisoners came together to our shop—they bought several articles—each bought articles for himself, and each paid for his own—Jackson had a dirty appearance.





HENRY LANCASTER
. I keep a beer shop, in Middle-street, Cloth Fair. I have known Cracknell between two and three years—on Monday, 12th Feb., he came to my house about 2 o'clock in the day—he called for a pint

of ale and went into the parlour—Jackson came in about five or ten minutes afterwards, and asked if there was a gentleman named Cracknell waiting—I opened the parlour, and showed him in—when I went in they were talking about selling a horse—Cracknell had a horse for sale, belonging to his master, Mr. Matthews, I believe—I followed Jackson into the room, I did not take notice of how they saluted each other—I was ordered to bring in a pint of spiced ale—I went for it, and when I came back they were talking about the sale of a horse—I did not notice the names they called each other—I had nothing to draw my attention in particular to this matter—I cannot tell what it was that Cracknell said about the horse—they could not come to terms about the horse, and they were talking about a suit of clothing—I went in and out once or twice—I cannot tell you everything—I was in there when Cracknell measured Jackson for a suit of clothes—I heard the order given—Cracknell said he would make a suit for 6l.—they were to be finished on that day week—Jackson said he should be up to market on the Monday, and they were to be brought to my place—they wanted change then for a note, because Jackson was to pay down 1l. deposit to Cracknell after he took the measure—Jackson first produced a 10l. note—I could not give change for that, but I could for a 5l., and he then produced a 5l. note—I brought it out, and told Mrs. Lancaster to go up and get change for 5l., which she did, and Jackson followed me out and came to the bar—I got. the pen and ink, and said, "Write your name down," and he put down "Samuel Brown"—Cracknell was not present then, he was in the parlour—I also saw the name of George Groom on the note, above where Jackson wrote—this is the note produced)—I gave Jackson change, three sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and 1l. in silver—Cracknell was in the parlour during-this time—Jackson wrote the name at the bar—Cracknell came out after I gave Jackson the change, and he gave Cracknell a sovereign that he was to have for a deposit, and Cracknell wrote a receipt on a bit of paper, "Received, one sovereign," and he was to have the things made that day week—they had a talk together a bit, and they had another glass of ale, and stopped a quarter of an hour or so at the bar, and then Jackson left—I dare say Cracknell stopped half an hour or three quarters more with me talking—I put the note in my pocket, and when I went to bed I put it up stairs—there was no other note—on the Friday or Saturday afterwards, Cracknell returned to my house—he said, "I understand my niece has been taking a bad 5l. note, Lancaster, and I hope yours is not the same"—I said, "I hope not, either"—I showed him the note, and he said, "We will go down to the bank with it on Monday morning"—I think this was on Saturday—I was rather uneasy to know whether it was good or bad, and I went down with it myself on the Monday—when I came back, Cracknell was at my place, waiting—"I said, "Cracknell, this is the same as your niece took, a bad 5l. note"—he said, "Well, Lancaster, you shall not be the loser, for I will pay you as soon as I can raise the money."—I said, "Do, because I want to pay it away"—which he did; he even pledged his things to make me the money—I was not present when he pledged them, but I have no doubt of it—he paid me the money in three instalments—he looked at the note when I brought it back, and he saw the names on it—he did not make any remark upon them—in the course of the same day I went with Cracknell to Drury-lane, to see if we could find Jackson—Cracknell went to his brother s, in the Strand, to get the clothes—I went with him—he said he had received a letter to take them to the Star coffee house, Drury-lane—he had no bundle when he started—he went

up a passage near Temple-bar—I went with him, but I did not go to his brother's place, I waited outside—I had never been there before—I know it was his brother's, because his brother came down with him with the bundle—we then went to Drury-lane, and met Mrs. Markham and Mr. Friend.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Cracknell previously to this? A. Yes, for two or three years, and always found him a very honest and respectable man—I believe he was in the employ of Mr. Matthews, a publican, for the last twelve months—he formerly kept a house in St. Mary Axe, as a tailor, and also in Aldersgate-street—I never knew any imputation against him.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know Jackson? A. I did not; I never saw the man before that day.





JOSEPH TRADD
. I am shopman to Messrs. Bartram and Harvey, woollen drapers, of No. 74, Holborn-hill. On Monday, 12th Feb., the prisoners came to the shop together, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I did not know either of them before—they conversed together at times—that enabled me to ascertain that Cracknell was a tailor—he asked for beaver cloth to make a great coat—I took some down at 10s. or 11s. a yard—they both looked at it—Cracknell decided it not to be good enough, so I got others that were better—they decided upon what cloth they would have—took no notice of what they said to each other—they did talk to each other, and they decided to have better cloth, and I cut off the length they required; it was only for one—Cracknell then asked for doeskins for trowsers—I showed them some—they looked at several pieces—there was some conversation between them as to the length they wanted, and they purchased enough for two pairs of trowsers and two vests—Cracknell then said they wanted vestings, and I passed them on to Mr. Grant.

Cross-examined. Q. Look at those things (some clothes produced by Moss); are those the things they purchased? A. The only thing I could swear to would be the doeskin for the trowsers—this is it—these trowsers form a portion of the doeskin.





RALPH GRANT
. I am a shopman to Messrs. Bartram and Harvey. On Monday, 12th Feb., the two prisoners were passed on to me by the last witness—Cracknell asked to be shown some fancy silks for waistcoats—they both decided upon having a length or two for fancy waistcoats—they talked together frequently—I cut off the silk for the waistcoats, and some lining—the things amounted to 5l. 7s. 6d.—Jackson paid for them; he gave me a 10l. note and half a sovereign, and I was to bring him in change a 5l. note—I took the note, and asked him to write his name at the back of it, which he did—he wrote "J. Parkins, Hoxton"—this (produced) is the note—he wrote this in my presence—Cracknell was standing by the side of him at the time, so that he could see what he wrote—I wrote on the note "Grant," and the date "12—2—55"—I am certain this is the note—I took it to the counting house, and gave it to the cashier—I brought the change in coin, and gave it to Jackson—he put it into his purse, or pocket—Cracknell then took the parcel, and went as far as the door with Jackson; he then told Jackson he should be with him directly, and he returned to the shop and got a commission—he then followed me again from the counting house to the shop, where we saw Jackson looking at another piece for a waistcoat—he bought it, and paid for it—during this time Cracknell spoke about Mr. Bartram, and he also said that he had known him when he was in Suffolk—he asked me his Christian name, and I told him.

Cross-examined. Q. I believe Mr. Bartram does come from Suffolk, does

he not? A. He does he is not here—I had seen Cracknell at our shop before, a few times, I think—I served him once myself—he buys goods which tailors ordinarily buy.





JOHN MOSS
 (City policeman, 225). In consequence of information, on Tuesday, 27th Feb., I went to the Beehive public house, in King-street, Commercial-road East, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I went into a little room at the back, which gave me the opportunity of seeing who came into the bar—about ten minutes after I was there I saw Cracknell come in, in company with Lancaster—they came into the room where I was, and had some ale together—I then said to Cracknell, "I am a police officer; I must take you into custody for being concerned with another party in uttering a forged 10l. Bank of England note at the shop of Messrs. Bartram and Harvey, Holborn-hill"—he said, "Yes, that is right; I went with the party, but I know nothing of him"—I was about to search the prisoner—he was in the act of putting something into his pocket—he said, "Search me at the station"—I searched him there and then; I found in his pocket two forged 5l. Bank of England notes—these are them (looking at the two uttered to Markham and Lancaster)—I found a pocket book on him—he said there was a letter in that that he had received from the party that he had been with to Bartram and Harvey's—this is it (the one produced)—he said that he had left the clothes that were purchased, at Mrs. Markham's, in Jewin-street, as security for the payment—I then took him to No. 3, King-street—I there found three waistcoat pieces.—(MR. GRANT. TWO of these are what I cut off)—he also produced to me a pawnbroker's duplicate—it referred to some doeskin, and other articles, pledged on 17th Feb.—I examined at the pawnbroker's the things it referred to—the notes were marked "Forged," as they are now—Cracknell said he had paid Lancaster the money for the one, and left the clothes with Mrs. Markham for the other—this receipt of Mrs. Markham's was in the pocket book—he said they went together to Lancaster's, and had some spiced ale there, and there was a 5l. note changed there, and that was the note—he said Lancaster had been to him, and he had just paid Lancaster the last pound, or something of that sort; I do not recollect the exact words—he said that Lancaster kept a beer shop in Cloth-fair, and he had known him for some time—I asked him if he knew anything of Jackson, and he said he knew nothing of him, further than going with him to these places, that is, Bartram and Harvey's, Markham's and Lancaster's—he said that he (Cracknell) had lived at the Beehive as waiter for about six months, and he had seen Jackson there—I asked where Jackson was most likely to be found, and he said the most likely place was Tiger's-bay—I asked him where Tiger's-bay was—he said that Brunswick-street was called Tiger's-bay, that it was close by the Beehive, and was infested with whores and thieves; that that was the most likely place, to find him there with those girls.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever recollect this before to-day? A. I remember it well now—I believe that part was not mentioned before the Magistrate—my examination there was taken down, and I signed it, but I do not believe that part was taken—I signed it as correct—I mentioned this about Tiger's-bay, at Mr. Freshfield's office—I have been in the force between eleven and twelve years—I am not in the habit of omitting important evidence; I have done so, we do not at all times think of everything—when I was about to search Cracknell, he was in the act of putting something away into his pocket—I believe I said that before the Magistrate—I said I found the note on searching him, but I do not think that was

explained—I said I searched him, and found two notes—I did not say anything about his being in the act of putting something into his pocket—this is the first time I have given that evidence—I can explain it—I followed Cracknell and Lancaster down stairs to a room, and it seemed that they were in the act of settling—Cracknell had these two notes out in his hand and was in the act of putting them away, when I told him I was a police officer, and must take him into custody—I did not see any money pass.





WILLIAM WYBIRD
. I am inspector of bank notes, at the Bank of England. These notes are all forgeries—the two 5l. notes are from the same plate, and the two 10l. notes are from the same plate.

MR. SLEIGH, on behalf of Cracknell, proposed to call the prisoner Jackson as a witness.
MR. JUSTICE ERLE
inquired whether such a course had ever been taken before.
MB SLEIGH
was not aware that one prisoner had ever been examined on behalf of another, although it was very common to examine one of the parties charged, on behalf of the prosecution.
MR. JUSTICE ERLE
expressed some doubt whether it should be done; the statute not having removed the so called privilege of prisoners not being liable to have any question put to them that could operate either for oragainst themselves; he had never known this course adopted, and whenever it had been necessary to examine a prisoner, he had always gone through the form of trial and sentence, or trial and acquittal, so that the entire matter should be at an end before such evidence was given; he would, however, receive the evidence if it was desired, and consult the Judges on the subject.


Jackson was here given in charge for having been previously convicted: to which fa pleaded



NOT GUILTY.





THOMAS GOODMAN
 (policeman, S 70). I know the prisoner Jackson; I was present at his trial, at the June Session, 1851, for sheep stealing; he was convicted, and sentenced—I produce the certificate of his conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(
This being read, certified the conviction of George Jackson, of receiving twenty sheep, and that he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment.)


GUILTY. Aged 40.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.






GEORGE JACKSON
 (the prisoner, was then examined by Mr. Sleigh as follow:)—I first became acquainted with Cracknell, some six or seven months ago perhaps; at the Beehive public house, merely by going into the house, as I was living close by, to have a pint of beer at different times, while he was in the employment of Mr. Matthews—in the early part of Feb., I was in communication with him—I am sorry to say that I have been wholly and solely the guilty party, and I am very sorry that I did not know at the time the responsibility that was attached to the man, Cracknell—he knew nothing at all of the affair, nor did I know that a responsibility was attached to him for being in my company—I am sorry that I have been the means of bringing an innocent man to the bar of his country—the beginning of the transaction was the buying of a horse, I do not exactly remember when it was—it was in St. Martin's-lane—Mr. Matthews, I understood, had a horse and chaise to be sold, and I bid Cracknell a price for the lot, which he did not think proper to accept—I think it was in Dec.—I do not know the day of the month—I had these notes in my possession, which the parties who employed me at St. Martin's-lane had intended to pay for this horse and chaise, provided a bargain had been come to—I represented to Cracknell that I was going to Australia, and that I was going to buy some things, and if he could recommend me to any of the parties that he dealt with, I should be very happy—he said he had a niece in the hosiery line; if I wanted anything of that sort, shirts, flannels, or handkerchiefs, I might as

well let her have it in the way of business, and we went there and passed a 5l. note with her—I accompanied him to the other two places that have been mentioned; upon which occasions notes were passed by me—I did not communicate to Cracknell, nor did he know that either of those notes were forged—I never gave my address to Cracknell; this note signed "Parkins," is my writing—there was such a place as the Star coffee house, in Drury-lane, but I understand it has since been made into a broker's shop.
(George Matthews, a licensed victualler, deposed to Cracknell's good character.)

CRACKNELL—


NOT GUILTY
.
(


There were two other indictments against Cracknell for uttering the other forged notes,


upon which no evidence was offered.

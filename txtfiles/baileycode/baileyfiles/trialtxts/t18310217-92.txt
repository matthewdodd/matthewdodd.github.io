JOHN BAINBOROUH. I know the prosecutor's shop; he is a cheesemonger
, and lives at No. 163, Shoreditch


. I found the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from his shop, and having heard the cheese had been stolen, I collared him, and said, "You are the man I have been looking for: you have a cheese here;" I put my hand under his coat, and took this cheese out.

            . I live with Mr. Thomas House - he is a cheesemonger; this is his cheese - we lost it on the 3rd of February, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening from the shop door.
Prisoner's Defence. A man gave me the cheese, and said he would give me 6d. to carry it.

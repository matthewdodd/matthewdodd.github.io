THOMAS IRONS
(police-constable B158.) I was on duty in Queen'srow, Pimlico—I saw the prisoner come down Arabella-row, about three hundred yards from Sir George Mundy's, about two o'clock in the morning, on the 22nd of December—he had a bundle, partly concealed—he was walking very fast on the dark side of the road—I asked what he had got—he hesitated, and then said it was a bird—I said, "What kind? "—he said, "A pheasant"—I said it appeared very large—he said he had two—I took him to the station-house, and asked where he got them—he said from a brother-in-law in the service of Mr. Stewart—I went there, and no such person was there—I opened the bundle, and it contained a hare and two pheasants, all dead.






DIANA COLE.
I am housekeeper to Sir George Mundy, knight, No. 2, Grosvenor✗-street West, Pimlico. On the 21st of December I saw this game—it was sent that day, and was hung up in the area—I saw them again in custody of the policeman—I knew them, and I knew the string I had tied on the birds—I did not see them after dark on the 21st.

Prisoner's Defence. I got them from this friend, who had them from the country—I did not say my brother was in Mr. Stewart's service—I said he had lived with him.

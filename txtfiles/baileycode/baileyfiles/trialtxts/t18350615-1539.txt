1539. 




ELIZABETH MORTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of June, 1 sovereign and 1 crown, the monies of 



Charles Belward, from his person.






CHARLES BELWARD
. I live at Camden-town, and am a cook. I was going home on the 18th of June, and met the prisoner—she accosted me in the street, persuading me to go with her, and attempted to draw me out of my road—I disengaged myself from her as quick as possible, and I missed a sovereign and a crown-piece from my pocket—I had not been with her more than three minutes, and that in the middle of the street—I followed her, seized her by the arm, and the sovereign dropped from her—I called the policeman—he picked it up, and found the crown-piece upon her.

Prisoner. Q.; Did you not say you would give me 3s.; 6d.; to go down

a gateway? A. No; that I swear solemnly—I never took her out of the light of the lamp—I did not give her the crown in mistake for a half-crown, and the sovereign for a shilling—she spoke to the policeman after I left her.





WILLIAM TIBBS
 (police-constable E 94.) The prisoner came up to me, and said, "You are the man that gave me fifteen days"—I said, "No; I gave you a month"—I left her and heard a scuffling—I turned and saw the prosecutor and her together scuffling—I found the sovereign, and I found this crown in her bosom—she only said, "I am done."

Prisoner's Defence. I left the prosecutor. He came back and laid hold of my arm—I went to open my hand to see what I had got, and the sovereign fell down—I thought it was a shilling.





CHARLES BELWARD

re-examined. I was perfectly sober. I do not know what opportunity she had of putting her hand into my pocket—the certainly was the most dexterous thief I ever knew.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I live in Theobalds road, on the 22d of June, about ten minutes before ten, the two prisoners passed me as I stood at my shop door, loaded with lead on their shoulders, the aspect of the prisoners, and the unreasonable hour of carrying lead in the street, gave me the strongest reason to suppose they had stole it, the candles at the shop gave a full light of the prisoners, I determined to give charge of them if the watchman was at his stand, I did so, the watchman run after them and found them, I took one with the lead on his shoulders, the other was about twenty yards further with the lead on his head, he endeavoured to throw the lead upon me, but a person came by and assisted me, and the prisoners were taken with the lead upon them, and carried to the watch-house, one of the prisoners, Butler, as the watchman told me, flung out of his pocket these instruments, apick-lock and turn-screws which the constable gave into my possession; in the morning the owner came and owned the lead, I I know the piece of lead which will be produced: this is the lead found on the prisoners.

I know no more than that is the lead which was cut from the building, the carpenter and I cut it up, and I marked it up and the figure was on, I can swear it to be the property of

             sworn.
I am a watchman, I stopped the prisoners by the information of Mr. Warton they had the lead in their possession, it is here.
(The lead produced and deposed to by Weichsell, and Cross.)
PRISONER BUTLER's DEFENCE.
Coming along Theobald's road, we met a tall man, and he asked us to give him a spell, I asked him what that was, he said help me with this to Gray's-inn-lane, and I will give you a pot of beer and 6 d; I took one bit and the other prisoner took two, when I came to the watch-house they shewed me a parcel of things like keys, and they said that they belonged to me; I knew nothing of them, I have a sick mother to provide for, I have been long out of work.
Prisoner Goodwin. I have nothing to say but what he has said.

               transported for seven years

. I was in the house about twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, and about twenty-five yards from the warehouse door; hearing the cry of
"Sweep" very loud, I stepped back, and saw a person holding the door open outside, and the prisoner with one knee on the ground, and his arm grasping this bale; he had it nearly on his shoulder; it was two feet nine inches off the ground; he moved it from a corner. I ran forward; he ran out; I secured him in White Rose-court, without losing sight of him. He had left the bale behind him. He had no business there whatever.
Prisoner. Q. Is it possible I could move it - A. He did lift it up; it weighs 133 lbs.; he lifted it off the ground and placed it on another bale.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I could not carry it.

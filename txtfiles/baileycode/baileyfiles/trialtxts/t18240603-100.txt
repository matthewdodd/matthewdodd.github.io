            . I live in New-street-square. On the 30th of May I was in Chiswell-street


, and had a silk handkerchief in my pocket - I was walking with my child, and felt something press on my shoulder, and a hand in my pocket at the same time. I turned round, and laid hold of the prisoner - he had the handkerchief, and threw it down; there was another person near him, whom I also suspected - he ran down Grub-street. Mr. Gurling said he saw it done, and we took him to the watch-house.

            . I live in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's. I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Mr. Ball's right hand coat pocket. Mr. Ball turned round, and seized him, and asked me to assist in taking him to the watch-house. There was another person near him.

                  , from his person
            .
HENRY WESTLEY, Esq. I am a gentleman
. I was at Covent-Garden Theatre


 on Friday evening the 11th of April; I was handing some ladies to a carriage when the play was over; I had not shut the carriage door, intending to get in myself, but a man came up and snatched at my watch-chain; he got the seals, the rings, and a portion of the chain; he snatched with considerable force; I made an effort to take him, but he escaped under some coaches; and the prisoner knocked me down on one knee, which prevented my seizing the thief - I have no doubt whatever that it was done intentionally - I took the prisoner; he struggled very much, but I gave him in charge.
Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You did not see the prisoner near you at the time your property taken? A. Yes, they were both together, and the other took the seals; it did not occupy a minute; I did not pursue the person who took them; the prisoner did not say it was accidental; he denied that he pushed me at all; he did not say his eyes were bad, and he could not see.

            . I live in Gate-street, Spitalfields, in the parish of Christ-Church


; I went out about twelve o'clock on the 12th of April; when I came home at eleven at night, I found my house broke open; I missed 5 lb. of black down silk to the value of 5 l. I left nobody in the house when I went out. I took up the prisoner and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Craddock
               



             upon suspicion; they denied it. I found the staple of the door drawn from the padlock; my wife went out after me and locked it; when I came home the people below were at home: at the second examination the prisoner owned before the Justice that he told this lad I was out, he might get the silk if he would, and he went and got the silk and sold it for 1 l. 17 s. that Craddock told him I was not at home, and then he went and took the silk, I went to the woman who keeps a chandler's shop, and there I found my silk. (The silk produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I am an officer; I was present when this silk was found at the chandler's shop; the woman is not here.

             brought this silk into my room on Easter Monday between the hours of two and four o'clock.

            . I am the prisoner's father; he used to behave very well and honour his parents; he never wronged man, woman, child, or chick; he worked at portering for his living.

            . I am a servant
 to a lady in Red-lion-square; going home at nine o'clock in the evening, on the 2d of October, in Little Queen street


, opposite Parker's-lane, the prisoner came behind me, and snatched my cloak off my shoulders; he was a minute in taking it from me; then he ran down Parker's-lane; I followed him, crying stop thief! I saw him throw the cloak down, and then he walked; I came up to him, and accused him of having stolen it: I delivered him into the hands of the constable.
The constable deposed that he took the prisoner into custody; after which he knocked down one of the watchmen and run away, but they pursued him and retook him.
The prisoner, in his defence, said, he was innocent; that he was walking home when he was stopt; that he saw a person run by on the other side of the way.
He called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            . I am a widow woman; I live in Well's-row, Islington. On the 26th of July, I gave the prisoner these things to take to the manglers, about one o'clock in the day; she never returned with them. The prisoner lodged with me two nights.
ELIZABETH CAREY. Margeret Ryan brought me these things to mangle, on the 26th of July, in the forenoon; she came for them again, and paid me for the things, and took them away. The things have never been found.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to look after a place, Mrs. Davis gave me these things to take to the manglers; she told me to fetch them back again; when I came out of the manglers with the things I met a woman, she asked me if I was out of a situation; I said, I was. She told me, she knew a place; she sent me after a place; she held the things until I came out, and when I came out, she was not there. Mrs. Davis's daughter came after the things; I told her the same as I tell now. They took me up two or three days afterwards.
Prosecutrix. On the 26th of July, she took the things; she was not taken until the 17th of August. We told her to bring them home, and gave her from the Monday till the Wednesday.

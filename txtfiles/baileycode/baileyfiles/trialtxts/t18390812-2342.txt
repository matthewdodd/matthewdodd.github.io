JOHN PADBURY
 and 




HENRY PADBURY
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
9th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., from the person of a man unknown; and that John Padbury had been previously convicted of felony.






CHARLES HENRY BAGNOL
. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 9th of August, at nine o'clock in the evening, I was on duty at Drury-lane—I saw the two prisoners there—I watched them nearly 100 yards—I saw them attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket twice—the third time John Padbury took the handkerchief from his pocket—the other was close by him at the time, indeed I do not know whether he did not touch him—they then ran across the road—I followed, and secured them both—John Padbury threw the handkerchief away—I let go of Henry, and he started off-another witness caught him—I did not know the gentleman's name—he turned up Long-acre, and they turned towards Great Queen-street—I went after them, and by that means lost sight of the gentleman.





GEORGE LAWLER
. I am an apprentice. I was in Drury-lane, walking with Bagnol—I saw the prosecutor and a lady going on, and the two prisoners followed—John took the handkerchief—Henry was close by him at the time—when they got the handkerchief they ran across the road, and I saw John throw it away.

John Padbury's Defence. As I was coming down Drury-lane, going home, some gentleman stopped me, and said he had got me—I said, "What for?"—he said, "It is all right" they took me off, picked up the handkerchief by the side of me, and said I had thrown it away.





GEORGE MARSH
. I produce a certificate of the former conviction of John Padbury—(read)—I was a witness at his trial—he is the person who was tried and convicted.'

JOHN PADBURY—


GUILTY
. Aged 20.

HENRY PADBURY—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.




Transported for Ten Years.

Before Lord Chief Justice Denman.

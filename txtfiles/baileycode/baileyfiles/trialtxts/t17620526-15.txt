Martha Green. I keep a public house
 at Ratcliff-cross


. Last Tuesday was sevennight, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into my house and called for a tankard of beer. I had known the man upwards of 20 years, the woman I never saw before to my knowlege. I drew it in a silver tankard: they were in the kitchen, and nobody there but themselves. He smoaked a pipe. I went out, and left my daughter

                  Halbert 
               



             at home. I was soon sent for by some of my neighbours, and when I came home I found a French plate beilied tankard, with the beer in it, and mine was gone. [She produced the French plate bellied tankard.] This is what they left, it is not like mine: mine was an old-fashioned tankard, not with a belly, but streight, with a wide bottom: it cost me nine guineas. The neighbours went some one way and some another, but could not meet with them.
Q. How long had you been gone out of your house before you was sent for?
M. Green. I had not been gone a quarter of an hour. I was not got into the house I was going to. The woman was taken in the Minories that very night, and brought to my house about nine o'clock. The man was taken over the water. I never found my tankard again. Soloman said before the Justice, that the woman had a tankard when she came into my house, and another when she went out. The woman denied knowing any thing of it.

            . I am Mrs. Green's daughter: the two prisoners came into our house, and called for a tankard of beer: they came into the room in which I was ironing. They said they would go into a room that was cooler. There was no fire in the room I was in; but there was one in the kitchen where they went. My mother carried them a tankard of beer in a silver tankard, not at all like this French plate one. He called for a pipe: my mother carried him one. After that I went into the room they were talking together in their own language, I did not understand them. The tankard was then standing before them. My mother went out to a neighbour's, and they went away about ten minutes after, and sent the reckoning to me by a young man that lodged in the house, and is now gone to sea. He went into the room to fetch a pair of shoes as they were going out: they gave him the money to give to me. I observed the woman had something in her apron that looked like the size of a tankard, with a flat bottom, which I saw through her apron. I went into the room four or five minutes after for a heater, and saw this French plate tankard upon the table. I knew directly it was not our tankard: it was full of beer all but about half a pint. The young man said the Jews have got the tankard, and left this.
Q. Did any body else go into the kitchen while the prisoners were there?
E. Halbert. No; only the young man, and he went just within for his shoes.

            . I was going through Mrs. Green's house with some cloaths to hang in the yard. I saw the woman at the bar take up the tankard and drink as I went by her.
Q. Was it this tankard?
M. Mother. No, it was not this: it was an old-fashioned tankard.
Solomon's defence.
I drank part of a tankard of beer: I paid my reckoning, and went out.
Levi's defence.
We went in and call'd for a tankard of beer: there were more people in the room than us. We paid our reckoning in order to go over the water. I had bread and cheese in my lap to eat. It is a public house where one goes and another comes, and they put it upon us because we are Jews.

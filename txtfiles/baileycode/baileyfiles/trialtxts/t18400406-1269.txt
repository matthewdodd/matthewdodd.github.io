THOMAS COOPER

of the 8th of April I was in Little Britain—I received information, turned, and saw the prisoner, and accused him of having stolen my handkerchief—he denied it—he was searched in my presence, and this handkerchief found on him—it is mine, and was safe a quarter of an hour before.

Prisoner. Q. Did not a gentleman cross the road, and say, "You have got a gentleman's handkerchief?" then you ran across, and said, "Yes, that is my handkerchief." it was found on the stones. A. It was taken from under your waistcoat.





WELCOME COLE

ADAM SPAREY

JOHN ANDERSON

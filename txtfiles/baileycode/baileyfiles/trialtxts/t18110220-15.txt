, No. 1, Pickett Street, Temple Bar


; on the 9th of February, about six o'clock in the evening the prisoner came into our shop, she inquired for a few yards of black linen, she bought nothing, and at the time the prisoner was going out of the shop, I perceived a piece of print under her cloak, she was in the act of lifting it up with her hand, endeavouring to conceal it, I caught hold of her, and pulled it from her.
Q. When had you seen this print the last time before it was stolen. - A. I had seen it in the course of the day, it was exposed at the door, inside of the shop; it cost about eighteen pence a yard.
Prisoner's Defence. My husband had been receiving some money, he said he would buy me an apron, I asked for some black linen to make an apron, I had this print in my hand, and was looking at it, I had no intention of stealing it, I only moved from the counter to call my husband at the door.
Jury Q. to Taggart. Was she out of the shop. - A. No, she was going out of the shop.

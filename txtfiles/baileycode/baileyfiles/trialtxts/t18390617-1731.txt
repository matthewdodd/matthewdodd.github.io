SIR JOHN TAYLOR COLERIDGE, KNT
. I am one of her Majesty's Judges. I changed my clothes at Westminster-hall on the 24th of May, and my handkerchief was safe then—as I was going along Montague-place I received some information—I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—this is the one I lost on this occasion—(looking at it.)

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Have you a mark on it? A. Yes—I have no other Christian name than those I have mentioned.





WILLIAM LIGHTFOOT
. (police-constable S. 65.) About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 24th of May, I was on duty in St. Martin's-lane—I saw the prisoner with two others following the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his trowsers pocket—I went up—I took the prisoner, and called another person to assist me—I told a policeman to go after the prosecutor, and he came to the station-house.

Cross-examined. Q. You swear you saw him take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket? A. I will—the prisoner kicked me very violently, and tried to get away.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

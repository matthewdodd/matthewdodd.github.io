            . I keep a sale shop
 in Monmouth-street


; the prisoner had been in my shop; as soon as she was gone, I missed a gown; about a fortnight after, she came into the shop again; suspecting her, I saw her take the cloak and put it under her arm, and then I saw her convey it into her pocket; she went out of the shop; I followed her to a public house; I questioned her; she denied having any; I brought her back into the shop, and she was searched, and the cloak was found upon her.
Mrs. Dawson. A linen gown was missed; when the prisoner was searched a duplicate was found upon her, which led us to the pawnbroker where it was pawned.
- Huckling. I am a pawnbroker: I do not know who pawned this gown.

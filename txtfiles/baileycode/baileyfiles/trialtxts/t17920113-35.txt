             sworn.
I am a cheesemonger: the prisoner applied to me, and asked me if I bought waste paper; I told him I did; the first I bought of him was in the month of November; I bought of him four or five times; he shewed me some of it; I bought to the amount of 2 or 300 lb. weight; I asked him whose property it was; he said he was sent by Mr. Hibbet's butler, that his master had given it to him; part of the paper I have kept; it stood publicly in the shop; I could distinguish this, because these are in books, and the rest are all news-papers, or quite different. (Produced.) The last purchase was not long before Christmas.

             sworn.
I am clerk in the counting-house of Sir 
               
                  Joshua
                   Vanneck
               



            : on the 4th of January, a gentleman called from Sir 
               
                  Sampson
                   Wright
               



            's, with a book, to know if I knew any thing of it; I believe his name is Davis; on examining the book, I found it was the writing of the late Sir Joshua, the father of the present Sir Joshua: we get into the counting-house out of a stable-yard, and adjoining to the counting-house is a coach-house, and over the coach-house is this room where the books were deposited; there is no room over the counting-houses; the room over the coach-house was occupied for old books that we did not want; we have a door that comes into the coach-house, and there is a part of a pair of stairs, and a ladder; on entering that room, Mr. Cowling and I found all the books were laid out of their place, taken off the pile, so that you could hardly get into the room; I went in by a key, and found it locked; 
               
                  James
                   Cowling
               



             was with me; and amongst the books lay a parcel of china plates, and two silver waiters, which I have here; and a door which has communication from this room to a hay-loft of Mr. Raikes was unbolted, and open; and there was a hole between the window and this door, which is a narrow place only of lath and plaister next to the door, big enough for a man to come through, and it was filled up with hay; and on going out, when we found things in this situation, I found a paper which is the contents of what plate was in the box; I have kept it ever since. (Produced.) Here is another list, which laid with them, and some of the china: on Saturday following I went with these papers, and this silver waiter, and part of the china, to Sir 
               
                  Sampson
                   Wright
               



            's, and examined it against the plate that was in the box; it exactly corresponded with the coat of arms that was in the trunk, and with the list, except a few things that are sold: all the things that were at Sir 
               
                  Sampson
                   Wright
               



            's are here, sealed by Justice Addington's seal and mine.

             sworn.
I am clerk to Sir 
               
                  Joshua
                   Vanneck
               



            ; I know those things belong to Sir 
               
                  Joshua
                   Vanneck
               



            ; I went into the room with the last witness; the door we generally go in was locked, as I last left it; I really think it was eight months ago I was in before; I remember the condition in which it was left: when I went in with the last witness, every thing seemed to be moved from its place; there was no obstruction by the door-way at all; the things always were aukwardly placed; immediately when I got in, I observed a chest of china removed from under the window, and great part of it taken out; I observed a hair trunk missing.
Was that trunk ever found? - Yes; it contains the plate.
It is not in the indictment? - I missed nothing else, except a quantity of old books, taken from the premises, written account-books, copy-books, and sundry other books; I knew enough of them to know them again; I found two waiters, as soon as I entered the room; and the second time I went up in the room I found two inventories; I found a door that goes into the hay-loft open; there was part of the lath and plastering, from the door to the window, broke along at the bottom.
Were those the waiters? - They were, and they have the coat of arms upon them.
Did you compare the waiters with the things in Sir Joshua's box? - I did.
Do you know who they belong to? -

            , a correspondent of ours, now in Switzerland; they have been there eight or ten years.
It was not Sir

                   Vanneck
               



            's house then? - Yes, it was then Mr. Vanneck's; they were put in, by his order, for Mr. Chershott; he was a gentleman who lived in Leicestershire, and going abroad, they were left in our care for him.
Jury. Whether he knows how long that hole had been made in the lath and plaster? I never saw the hole before I went up the last time; I was up there eight months ago, and not since, till this time.

             sworn.
I am coachman to Mr. 
               
                  Thomas
                   Raikes
               



            . How long has Mr. Raikes lived in thishouse? - I believe about six years; I have been his coachman five years next May.
Was the prisoner in your master's service? - No, he had been my helper for the course of the last eight or nine weeks; by getting into the stable, he got into the hay-loft; it adjoins to the rooms where these things were kept; he used to carry provisions there.
Had you sent him for provisions before these nine months? - No, not till he used to help me; he had my keys, and had liberty to sleep in the stables; I have locked him in, and let him out in the morning.
Prisoner. Who had the keys while I was out at sea? - I don't think any body at all had.
Court. Had he been employed before he went to sea? - Yes.
For the last eight months who has had the keys out of your hands? - Two or three have had them for an hour or two, but not more.
Prisoner. My Lord, I have helped him four years, off and on.
Simper. He hath, to be sure, but not as he has these eight weeks; I suppose I did not see much of him before that for three or four weeks.

             sworn.
I am a publican, at the Globe, in North Audley-street; the prisoner lodged at my house eight or ten days, a little before Christmas; Friday before, he went from my house, and returned on the Monday, with a hair trunk, and a box of china and plate; on Tuesday morning he said his uncle was dead, and had left him nine hundred pounds, and sent and had a lock and key put upon the hair trunk; on Wednesday he went to Mr. Ibbott, in Broad-street, and said that Mr. Ibbott went to look over the will, and that he had a quantity of plate left him by his uncle; I understood him to talk of the plate and china in the box: on Thursday morning he asked me to go with him to the silversmith's, to sell a pair of candlesticks, Mr. Dalby's, Bond-street, and he said Mr. Ibbott was to go with him to his uncle's, at Windsor, to see if there was any thing more of plate left, at twelve o'clock: he took the plate away that day to Mr. Ibbott, as he told me; he went away in a hackney-coach, and took it in the coach with him: on the Friday morning I saw the coachman that took him, and I asked him where he took the box; in consequence I gave information, and had him apprehended; I saw him in custody the Wednesday after, and he was committed: the hair trunk was opened in the tap-room on Tuesday, the day after he brought it, and I saw most of the articles; three or four pair of candlesticks, a bread-basket, and some silver spoons; I never saw the box again till I saw it at Bow-street; the officers found it, and I believe it is the same I saw at my house.
Prisoner. Did not I expose them all about to the people in the tap-room, and say they were come up from the country to me? - You did, and said they came by the coach.
- DALBY sworn.
I am a silversmith, in New Bond-street: one of the witnesses brought the prisoner at the bar to my house, Wednesday the 28th of December, and brought some silver tablespoons, and a caster, for me to weigh them; Abbott said they had been laying a wager about the weight, and wished to know; and I weighed and told them, and they took them away; they were both strangers to me then: on Friday morning, the 29th, they came again, and brought a pair of candlesticks, and I asked Abbott if they were the prisoner's property or not; he said, yes, he knew they were, and that his uncle was dead, and had left him nine hundred pounds; I asked him his name, and where he lived; he said Abbott, and kept the Globe, in North Audley-street; I said I should put his name down, to know, if any thing should happen about these candlesticks; with that, I weighed the candlesticks, and gave him the money for them, 7 l. 11 s. 6 d.; I have kept them ever since.

Mr. Abbott. This is the box I delivered to Davis, and which the prisoner left with me; I gave the information, hearing he had carried the trunk to another place, when he told me he was going to carry it to Mr. Ibbott's.
Had you any information to whom they belonged, before you went to the justice? - No, no further than I apprehended myself; I did not know to whom it belonged, till after I made the information.

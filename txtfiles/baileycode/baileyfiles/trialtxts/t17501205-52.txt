            . I live at the sign of the George; I was taking down a lamp at my door, the prisoner came down the passage, as though she came down stairs; I ask'd her where she had been, she ask'd me what it was o'clock; she had a cloak on when I took hold of her; she threw her cloak up, and said, you may search me, I have got nothing; and as she turn'd round, my wife saw the hat through a hole in her petticoat, so we took it from her. It was produc'd in court and depos'd to.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went up stairs along with a little girl; she gave me a hat, and said, stay till I go down stairs; I did, then I came down, and did not see the girl afterwards.

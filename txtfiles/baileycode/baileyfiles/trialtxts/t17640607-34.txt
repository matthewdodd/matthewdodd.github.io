            . I live at Islington


. My wife awaked me between two and three o'clock, on the 10th of May, and said she heard somebody coming over the pales; and that she heard the hens wings flutter: I got up and took a hand whip, and a man, who took a pick-ax elve, and went down, and took the prisoner in the yard, which was not big enough to turn a horse round in.

            . I live in the prosecutor's house. I got out of bed, and saw some things flung over the pales, which we found afterwards to be two hens of Mr. Foster's, and the cock, the property of Mr. Wildman: we found them dead on the outside.
Foster. I asked him how he came to think there were fowls there? he said, he was going by, and heard the cock crow, and the devil possessed him to take them.

. On the 6th of April, about ten minutes past four o'clock in the afternoon. I was sitting in the parlour, and heard the lock of our till strike - I went out, saw the prisoner on his knees behind the counter, with both his hands in the till; I seized him - he struggled very much, and struck me in the face - I called loudly for assistance, and a person came in and secured him; the officer came in and found seven half-crowns, and two shillings on his person, but I missed a sovereign, which was not found - I missed several half-crowns from the till; the prisoner never got from me - I closed the door, and he broke a square of glass, but never got out.

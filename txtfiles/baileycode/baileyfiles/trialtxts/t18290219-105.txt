            ; we have apartments on a first floor, at Great Harford-street


. About twelve o'clock, on the 27th of January, I had been down in the kitchen, and on going up I met the prisoner just coming out of my room door; she asked if a mistress somebody who she mentioned, lived there; I said No; I saw a bundle under her shawl, and asked if she had been into my room - she said No; I said, "I can't let you go till I have seen what you have got:" she said she had nothing, but when she found I would not let her go, she turned back, and put the bundle down in a chair - it contained the coat and trousers, which are my husband's; I called my landlord.

            . I am the landlord. Faris called me up - I went for the officer, leaving one of my men to mind the prisoner - she was a stranger, and had no right there.

LOUISA PAINTER. (This witness appeared perfectly aware of the obligation of an oath.) I am eight years and a half old, and am the daughter of William Painter; I live with my mother, in Love-lane, Aldermanbury. On a Wednesday evening, about three weeks ago, I was in London-wall, bringing a sheet from my aunt's, in Cross-key-court, London-wall; she could not wash it, and I was taking it home again - the prisoner came behind me, and snatched it away from me; I had seen him before; I ran after him, crying Stop thief! somebody stopped him, and he was given to the constable; I am sure he is the person.

            . I am a coal-dealer. I heard this child call Stop thief! I turned round, and stopped the prisoner with this sheet under his arm - he said nothing - I gave him to the constable.

            . I took him in charge.
- PAINTER. I am the wife of William Painter, who is abroad. This sheet is mine; I had sent the child with it.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.

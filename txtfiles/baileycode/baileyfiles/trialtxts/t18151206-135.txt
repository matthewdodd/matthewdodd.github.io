               indicted for embezzling money

                  JOHN 
                  SWARBRECK GREGORY
               



            . I am in the house of Shepherd, Adlington, and Co. Solicitors. We have a gentleman in our house of the name of Faulkener; I gave him a draft upon Messrs. Hoare and Co. for ninety-seven pounds. Upon going into the office a short time afterwards, the prisoner was not there; he did not return that evening. In the course of the next day, I received a letter, in the hand writing of the prisoner; that is it.
(Letter read)
"Directed to J. S. Gregory, esq.
"SIR. I am sorry to inform you that I have lost the notes. I throw myself entirely on your mercy. I shall write to my friends, and make up the money for you. I am extremely sorry, but cannot help it."
"

            ."
Witness. I know nothing more of my own knowledge. I have seen the draft; that is the draft.

                  GEORGE 
                  FAULKENER
               



            . I was managing clerk in the house of Shepherd and Co. I gave the prisoner the draft in question to get cashed at Hoare's; he went out before three o'clock, and never returned. I heard nothing of him until the next morning, when I received a letter, which I believed to be the prisoner's hand writing; that is the letter.
"Addressed to George Faulkener, esq.
"DEAR, SIR. I have lost all but the silver. I shall not abscond. Perhaps you will write to my father; he, with my friends, will be able to make it up for you."
"YOURS,

                  RILEY
               



            ."
Witness. He was apprehended before I received that.
"A letter was now read, which appeared in the prisoner's hand writing, and which only shewed that he was applying for a situation in a school, in the Country, and which application was made in an assumed name, -

            ."
MR.

                  WILLOUGHBY
               



            . I am clerk to Messrs. Hoare and Co. I look at the check produced, which was paid by me, on the 1st of November; I paid it to the prisoner; he requested me to give his as small notes as I conveniently could, a certain number of five's, and ten's, and some silver, for Mr. Gregory.


                  WILLIAM 
                  HOOLE
               



            . I am a clerk in the Bank. I produce a note No. 16,198, a ten-pound note, dated 23rd of September, 1815; also 16.195, a ten-pound note, dated 23rd of September, 1815.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  CORKEN
               



            . My husband is a watchmaker, and lives in the Commercial-road. (Note 16,195, put into the hands of the witness.) I know this note; I took it from the prisoner; he paid it to me for a watch, on the 1st of November; I see the words "John Hernshaw, Houndsditch," upon it; the prisoner wrote those words in my presence.
Mr. Gregory. I believe that endorsement to be the prisoner's hand writing.
Mr. Faulkener. I am of a similar opinion.


                  SAMUEL 
                  DICKINS
               



            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I found the prisoner at about four o'clock, in Dogrow, Mile-end. I found nineteen shillings on him. He said, he had been obliged to spend one shilling, and he had lost the rest.
Mr. Willoughby. I produce my book. I paid the note 16,195, to the prisoner, as part cash for the check.

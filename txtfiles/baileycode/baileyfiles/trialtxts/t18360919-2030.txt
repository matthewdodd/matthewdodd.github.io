for stealing, on the

CHARLES BAMFIELD
. About half past one o'clock, on the 27th of August, I was in my shop in angel-court, Throgmorton-street, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket and give it to a stout lad, about eighteen years old, who ran away.

Prisoner. I was not near the gentleman. Witness. I am satisfied he was—I caught hold of him directly, and am quite sure I saw him take it.





THOMAS HUGHES
. On the 27th of August I lost my handkerchief, at the place described by Bamfield—I ran after the other boy, but he got away with the handkerchief.




GUILTY

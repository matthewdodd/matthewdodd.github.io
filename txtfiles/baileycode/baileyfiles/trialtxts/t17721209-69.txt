            , my husband, is a silver-smith
, in East-Smithfield


, the prisoner came into the shop on the 27th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; and offered to sell me a shirt buckcle; I did not buy it; he asked to look at some silver buckles: I took the drawer out, and he took up that pair of buckles to look at. As soon as he was gone I missed the buckles; I told the maid of it; I rung the bell for my husband, and the maid and I went after the prisoner; we overtook him; I charged him with stealing the buckles; he denied having been in the shop; I desired him to go back with me which he did; when we came back, my husband was in the shop; we searched him, and found the buckles in his left hand breeches pocket.

I was very much out of my mind, and could get no work; I actualy did it as the gentlewoman has said.

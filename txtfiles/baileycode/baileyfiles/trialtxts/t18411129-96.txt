WILLIAM JOHNSON
 and 




RICHARD BULL
 were again indicted for

 stealing, on the 
8th of October, 1 gelding, value 15l., the property of 



Thomas Pecknall.






THOMAS PECKNALL
. I live at Sutton at-Home in Kent—I had a gelding which I lost on the 8th of October—I saw it safe on the 7th, about seven or eight o'clock in the evening—it was locked up in the stable—my son went to the stable about four o'clock the next morning—he called me up directly, and I went, and the horse was gone—I did not see it again till the 5th of November, when I saw it at the Nag's Head public-house in the Borough—I am quite sure it was mine—the inspector wished me to leave it there—I left it for a week—I got it again, and I brought it up here to-day.





BENJAMIN COLLINS
. On the 8th of October, about seven o'clock in morning, or a little after, Bull brought the horse to me for sale, and Johnson was with him—I asked the price—he told me 20l.—I offered him 15l. for it if it would suit my work—it was agreed for me to have a week or a fortnight's trial—he agreed to take 15l.,—and took 7l. as a deposit, and if I did not like the horse he was to return the deposit—I saw no more of the prisoners till the two horses were brought to me by Johnson—they asked me whether I should like to purchase one of them, or whether the one I had would suit me—I said I did not expect to see them so soon, and I had only had one or two journeys on the horse—I had the horse in my possession till the 26th or 27th of October—I then delivered it to the inspector.





JOHN HAYNES
. I am a police-inspector—the horse was given up to me by Mr. Collins—I sent down to the prosecutor about the horse—he came to town, I showed him the horse I got from Collins, and he claimed it as his.

JOHNSON—


NOT GUILTY

. Aged 24.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; I was in the yard, close to the door, the prisoners Guest and Webb came to the door; they asked me to buy some herrings; I refused. They asked again, and I refused; in five minutes after the shoes were missing; I heard nothing of them till next morning.
THOMAS M'GEE. On the 20th of January, the prisoners were given into my charge for stealing bacon, they had an ass. I found the shoes in one of the panniers; Webb said he got them in exchange for herrings near Brentford, he drove the ass. I enquired, and found they belonged to the prosecutor. Hawker also said they bought them, all three of them being in company together.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
WEBB'S Defence. I gave a man 6 s. and 200 herrings for them.

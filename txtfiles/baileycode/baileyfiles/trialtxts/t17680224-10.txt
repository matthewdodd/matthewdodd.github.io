            . On the 28th of January, about half an hour after five in the afternoon, we found one bag of pimento cut, there were fifty or sixty in all: there were some taken out and put into a small bag, it belonged to Mr. 
               
                  Peter 
                  Paumier 
               



            ; my partner had got the prisoner in charge, we could not make him walk; we tied his hands and legs, he kicked us; we were forced to carry him from the key to London-bridge to put him a cart, before we could get him to the Compter.

            . Mr. Wyld and I had the pimento in charge, it is what is called pepper; about half an hour past five o'clock the prisoner was standing by the bags, I asked him what he was doing there; he said, nothing; I found one of the bags cut, and a good parcel of the pepper lying on the ground; there was also a bag with about five pounds and a half in it lying by the prisoner; that bag did not belong to Mr. Paumier; I had seen the bags not above six minutes before, they were all right then, and none cut.
Prisoner's defence.
I came from Bristol but about two days before, and was going to Billingsgate to get my passage on board a man of war, walking along they laid hold of me; I know nothing what they say, I did not meddle with any thing.

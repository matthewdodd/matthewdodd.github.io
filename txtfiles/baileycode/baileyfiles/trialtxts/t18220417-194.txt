            . I am a plasterer
. On the 4th of April. I was working at a corner house in Regent's Park


, and left my tools under the garret stair-case. I went on Saturday morning, and they were gone.

            . I work at the house, and have known the prisoner two years - he worked as a bricklayer. I was playing by the house on Good Friday, and saw him go into the corner house; I followed him up stairs, and saw him go under the garret stairs; he looked at the tools, and asked if they were stone-mason's tools; I said Yes, and he came down. He took nothing then.

            . I am an officer. On Saturday evening, the 6th April, I took the prisoner; and before I spoke to him, he said
"I know nothing of the tools." I found a trowel on the top of a cupboard in his room.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

WILLIAM GILBERT. I am a private watchman at St. Giles' workhouse. At a quarter-past six o'clock on Sunday morning, the 26th of April, I saw the prosecutor go along Broad-street, St. Giles'


, in a gig, and a cloak hanging over the back of it; I saw the prisoner running after it for several yards, and then saw him take the cloak and run away up a court; I sung out, Stop thief! he was pursued, and taken.
CHRISTOPHER BUSHELL. I was driving in the gig, and lost my cloak from the back of it - I heard an alarm, turned round, and saw the prisoner crossing the road with the cloak - this is it.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the cloak, opposite Plumtree-street; I went down a court, a man pursued, and look me.

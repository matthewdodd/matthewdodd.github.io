                  Thomas 
                  Bailey 
               



            . I have seen the prisoner begging about our neighbourhood, at times, for about 3-qrs. of a year. She used to sit near an empty house, where my children used to pass as they went to school. I saw my children go out to go to school, they had their stays and things on as usual, and they came home late without their stays.
Q. What are your children's names ?
Bailey. The eldest her name is Elizabeth, she is about seven years of age; the other's name is Sarah. I know nothing of the robbery but what the children told me. I advertised the things on the Monday following, and stuck up bills; the prisoner was taken on the 28th of October; she was charged with taking the cloaths off the children, she own'd she did, and had pawn'd one pair of stays for a shilling, and sold the other stays for 21 d. My wife went to the pawnbroker she mentioned, and return'd and said, that the pawnbroker said he knew nothing of the prisoner. Then I went and got a search warrant from Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gower 
               



            , and went to the pawnbroker, and then he shew'd me his book; in looking it over I found, Old stays one shilling; then he produced the stays; here are other witnesses to speak to them.
Q. What were the words the prisoner made use of in her confession?
Bailey. I asked her how she could be so cruel as to take the cloaths from off the children; she said she did, and that she was sorry for it.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Bailey 
               



            . I am wife to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Bailey 
               



            . On the 24th of October I sent my children to school, dressed as usual, with their stays on; they were brought home about five in the evening without their stays, and some other of their things. I asked them where they had been; they said the woman that used to sit begging in the street had taken their cloaths from them.
Q. What did Elizabeth lose?
E. Bailey. She had lost her stays, her under petticoat, her cap, ribbon, and handkerchief.
Q. How old is she?
E. Bailey. She was seven years of age last Midsummer, the other five in May last. The prisoner was taken up on the 28th. I went to her at the Black Horse in Mill yard where she was in custody; they put her in a room with a dozen women. I had put my children in at a neighbour's house; I went and fetched my youngest child first, and asked her if she knew the woman that took her stays; she ran to the prisoner directly, and said, This is her, and clap'd her hand on her knee; the prisoner said, you are mistaken, it was not me; the child said, yes, it was you, and this is your child, (which was the child the prisoner held in her arms.) After that my eldest child was brought in, and she insisted upon it the prisoner was the woman, the same as the other did. The prisoner still denied it, but before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gower 
               



             she owned every thing that she was charged with.
Q. Were the children there at that time?
E. Bailey. They were. There was only this difference between the children's account and hers; the children said she took off their stays in a necessary house in Rosemary branch alley; but she said, it was not in that alley, but in another alley.


                  Christian 
                  Bailey 
               



            . I am grandmother to the children. I was sent for to Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gower 
               



            's to see if I knew the stays, as I usually dressed and undressed the children, and I knew them to be Elizabeth's stays.


                  James 
                  Thwate 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 24th of October the prisoner came to our house with this pair of stays (producing a pair.)
Q. to E. Bailey. Look at these stays.

E. Bailey. I did not use to lace them on, so I cannot swear to them, but believe they are what was taken from the child.
Q. to 
               
                  Christian 
                  Bailey 
               



            . Look at them, do you know them?


                  Christian 
                  Bailey 
               



            . I am very sure these are the stays that the child Elizabeth wore.
Thwate. The prisoner told me they were her own, and she wanted 18 d. on them, and I lent her a shilling.
Hazard Austin. My father made these stays for 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Bailey 
               



            , and we have new covered them since I brought them home to Mr. Bailey's house on the 15th of August last.


                  Thomas 
                  Jeffs 
               



            . I secured the prisoner, and brought her to my own house, and sent for Mr. Bailey and the children; I opened the door and let the youngest in; she ran directly up to the prisoner, and said, This is the woman, mamma, that took my stays.
Q. Was you with the prisoner before the justice?
Jeffs. I was, and heard the prisoner confess she took the things from the two children.
Q. Were the children's names mentioned to her ?
Jeffs. They were.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of it, for I was quite stupified in liquor; I can't really say any thing to it.
Thwate. I took these stays in on the 24th of October at nine in the morning, and the woman swore she lost them the same day in the afternoon.
Q. to 
               
                  Christian 
                  Bailey 
               



            . What time did you put the stays on that morning?
C. Bailey. I put them on the 24th of October before they went to school; it was about nine o'clock as near as I can remember.
Q. to Thwate. Name the time, as near as you can, that they were brought to your house.
Thwate. It did not exceed nine o'clock that morning when they were brought to me.
Q. to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Bailey 
               



            . What time did your children go out to go to school that day.
T. Bailey. The children did not go out to go to school till near ten o'clock.
Thwate. It was not nine o'clock when the stays were brought to me.
T. Bailey. Thwate's servant took them in, as she said before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gower 
               



            , about dinner time, and that her master gave her the shilling, and she delivered it to the prisoner. She was bound over in recognizance to appear here; I don't know what business he has here.
Q. to Thwate. What is your maid's name?
Thwate. Her name is 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Armstrong 
               



            .
Court to Clerk of the Arraigns. See if she is bound over.
Clerk of the Arraigns. She is bound over.
She was called upon her recognizance, and did not appear.
Q. to Thwate. Where do you live? that is necessary to be known.
Thwate. I live in Virginia-street, Ratcliff-highway.




               Guilty of felony only

            . I live at the Castle Inn in Wood-street


, on the 22d of December, when I was called up in the morning, I found my counting-house, adjoining to my dwelling-house, broke open, and the money missing which is mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner had lived servant with me about nine or ten weeks, but I had discharged him, but let him lie in my house. He lay there the night this happened, and I took him up on suspicion; he confessed he had taken two 36 s. pieces, a moidore, and three guineas; and by his direction we found the two 36 s. pieces and moidore in an old frock in his box, which was in my house, he said he had made use of the three guineas.

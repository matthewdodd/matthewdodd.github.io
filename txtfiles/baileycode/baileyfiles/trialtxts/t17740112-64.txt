            . I am a widow; I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment out of a drawer by my bed side on Friday night; the prisoner lodged in the house; when I got up in the morning I missed them; and the prisoner was gone; I never saw her from that time till she was taken up.
(The different articles mentioned in the indictment were produced by several pawnbrokers, who said they received them of the prisoner; the things were deposed to by the prosecutrix).

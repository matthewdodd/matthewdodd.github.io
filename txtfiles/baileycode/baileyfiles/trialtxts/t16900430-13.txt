            , were both Tryed for 


               stealing on the 19th of March

                           Robert

                   one Guinea, and a Luadore piece, and 3 l. 6 s. in Money
            , all which Money was found about him, (viz.) the Silver in his Pocket, and the Guinea in the Roll of his Breeches Knee, all which the Prisoner denyed, and used several Extenuations, but had no Evidence on his side. He had also Pick Locks about him, which tended much to his Discredit, so he was found 

               Guilty
            , but she was 

               Acquitted
            .

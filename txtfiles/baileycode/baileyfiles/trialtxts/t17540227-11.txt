It appeared by the evidence that the prisoner went into the prosecutor's shop to buy some candles, at which time the scissers were lying on the counter, but they were missing when he was gone. That the prisoner carried them to be ground at the cutler's who before had ground them for the prosecutor, who knew them again, and gave intelligence to the prosecutor; upon which, when he came for them again, he was stopped and committed.

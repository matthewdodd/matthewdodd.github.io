, on the 27th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, with a tin-case in my hand; the officer came in with the prisoner, and asked if I had lost any thing; I said I believed not, but he produced a silk handkerchief, and asked if it was mine; he said he had found it on the prisoner; I found it was mine; it had been in one of my pockets. I did not see the prisoner till he was brought in.

            . I am a marshalsman. I was coming out of Plough-court, and saw the prosecutor going along with a cash-box; the prisoner and another were close to him - the other went away, and when they got to the corner the prisoner left the gentleman; I stopped the prisoner, turned him round, and said, "What are you about?" I saw this handkerchief in his waistcoat pocket, and his coat was covering it. I went into the banker's, and Mr. Reid identified it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and saw a handkerchief fall - I took it up.

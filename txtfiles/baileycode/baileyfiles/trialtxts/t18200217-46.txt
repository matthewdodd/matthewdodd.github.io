            . I am a shoemaker
; the prisoner was my servant
. On the 15th of January I missed a pair of ladies boots from the warehouse, which had been brought in the night before. Suspicion fell upon the prisoner, and on the Saturday following I sent for an officer to examine her boxes, in which he found a dark lanthorn ready trimmed, and six duplicates, three of which relates to this property, pledged in her name.
HAZLEWOOD WORRALL. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's box, and found the dark lanthorn and duplicates.

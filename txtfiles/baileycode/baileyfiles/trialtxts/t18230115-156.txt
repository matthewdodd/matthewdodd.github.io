. On the 14th of January, just before one o'clock, I was informed this trunk was stolen from outside the door; I went out and took the prisoner at the corner of Wardour-street with it; he refused to go with me without an officer.

            . I am a footman. I saw the prisoner take the trunk; I followed him, and picked it up - he had thrown it down.
Prisoner's Defence. It is all right. I was very hungry, and thought it no harm to take it.

            . As on the 13th Day of December I was stripping Tobacco for Capt. Sutcliff, on Buttle-Wharf


, I saw this Prisoner sculking about, and sometimes he would give the Cooper a Hand, and sometimes the Porters. And every Hogshead he came at, he pull'd Tobacco: And one of the Porters at work with him, told him, he should send him to Bridewell. He went away and I run after him and search'd his Pockets, and found some conceal'd in his Pockets and some in his leather Apron.
Q. How much Tobacco?
May. About 3 lb.
Q. Did you see him take any out of Mr. Suteliff's Hogsheads?
May. Please you, my Lord, there were no other Hogsheads on the Keys. I brought him to Dark-house-Lane and there I charg'd - Maschil with him: The Prisoner deny'd this Charge.

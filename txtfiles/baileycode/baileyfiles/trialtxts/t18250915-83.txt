            . I am the wife of Thomas Knapton - we live in Prague-street, Paddington


. On the 11th of June, a little after twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of my parlour door - he turned round and asked for Mrs. Austin, a dress-maker - I said I knew no such person, and, on turning my eye, missed my watch off the mantel-piece; I had seen it safe only a minute before; he walked away quietly - I followed, and saw him give the watch to a companion - he then ran, and I overtook him in a brickfield, brought him to the top of the street, and gave him to my husband - the watch was worth 40 s., and I lost a purse, with 6 s. 6 s. in it, off the mantel-piece also.

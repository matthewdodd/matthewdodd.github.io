MOSS JEWELL. I am a watch-maker
, and live in Star-street, Shadwell


. On the 26th of July, between five and six o'clock, I left my shop, returned in about five minutes, and found the prisoners in the shop. I asked them what they wanted? Mason asked for a dial-plate. I missed a watch from the window where I worked, and asked Jones what he had done with the watch? he said, "Search me; I know nothing of it." Mason said "I know nothing of Jones; he was in the shop before I came in, and if he has got it he must have taken it." The officer came to the door, I called him in-Jones told him to search him, which he did, and found the watch on him. He did not then deny taking it. He must have reached over the counter to get it.

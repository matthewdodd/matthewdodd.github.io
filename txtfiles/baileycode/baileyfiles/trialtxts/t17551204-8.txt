            . On the 10th of October, about eight o'clock I was coming down Fleet-Street


; I saw the boy at the bar and a tall fellow pass me; they looked very hard at me; I said to the man with me, they have some design upon us. I saw the boy spit in his hand; then he put it quick into my pocket, and took out my handkerchief; I seized him by the collar while he had it in his hand (he produced a handkerchief.) I have only two of this sort; but whether this or the other at home is it, I can't tell.
Q. Did you look upon it at that time so as to be positive it was yours ?
Gretton. I did. I took him into a publick house, there he owned he took my handkerchief out of my pocket, and that he was set on by the tall fellow.
Prisoner's defence.
I did not take a handkerchief from him.

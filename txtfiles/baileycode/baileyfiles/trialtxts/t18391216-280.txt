 for stealing, on the 
2nd of December, 1 coat, value 10s., the goods of 



James William Nickelson.






JAMES LAPWORTH
. I am a carman, and live in Camomile-street, Bishopsgate. On Monday afternoon, the 2nd of December, a little after five o'clock, I was crossing Bishopsgate-street, and saw a horse and gig at Mr. Varty's door—I saw the prisoner take a Macintosh coat off the gig, walk along Bishopsgate, and give it to another man—I told a policeman, who followed and took them—I saw the prisoner in custody directly after—I am sure he is the one that took the coat.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How near were you to the gig when the coat was taken? A. About twenty yards—it was rather duskish—I saw no one in the chaise—I had never seen the prisoner before.





STEPHEN QUESTED
 (City police-constable, No. 373.) In consequence of information from Lapworth, I went in pursuit of the prisoner and another—I overtook them at the bottom of Clark's-place, Camomile-street, about 150 yards from the gig, and took them—the prisoner was pointed out as the man that took the coat—I made sure of him, and the other got from me—I got the coat from him—the prisoner and he were in company.

Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner at all intoxicated? A. Not the least—he walked and spoke like a sober man—they went round one corner—-they might have got seven or eight yards up Clark's-place—I went up Camomile-street, and met them at the other entrance.





JAMES WILLIAM NICKELSON
. I am a traveller. On Monday afternoon, the 2nd of December, I went to Mr. Varty, a linen-draper, in Bishopsgate, and left my horse and gig standing at the door, with my Macintosh in it—I saw it at the station-house about ten minutes after—this is it—(looking at it.)

Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave your gig in care of any body? A. Yes, of my brother—he is not here.

            , I was coming to London with my wife on the 30th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning - we got through Mile-end turnpike, and turned to go to Bedford-square; we went up a wrong turning, and found there was a tier of posts - I got down, tied my mare to a post, and went with my wife to her sister's; I did not stop above five minutes - when I returned my cloak was gone out of my cart.
SAMUEL PRENDERGRASS. I apprehended the prisoner with the cloak about ten o'clock the same morning; he was in the midst of three or four men, very had characters - when he saw me he dropped the cloak and a sack, and went away; I followed, called Stop thief! and he was taken.
Prisoner's Defence. I found it near the London Hospital - a man came into the Tenter-ground, and said there were officers coming, and I went away.(Property produced and sworn to.)

MARY HUNTLEY
. My husband is a cloth-worker. On the 19th of Nov., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went into my kitchen, and found this bundle at the foot of the stairs—the things in it are my husband's—I called for a young man who lodges in the house—I found the prisoner at the back area window—he caught me by the throat—I struggled with him, and got away—I went up stairs into the passage, out of the house, and called the police, who came and took him—all these things are my husband's—I had left them hanging wet in the kitchen—I do not know the prisoner.





WILLIAM MONTGOMERY
 (policeman.) I was called, and took the prisoner—I found an old knife on him—these articles were brought to me by a young man.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the house, and asked a young woman who came out, if I might go in to ease myself; as soon as I got in I met the prosecutrix, who gave me into custody.





JOSEPH WARD
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read, Convicted May, 1845, and confined three months.)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             . The beginning of March I lost this copper out of my back house .
- Carrey. The prisoner Mills brought the copper to me to sell, he told me his father was dead and his mother sent him; I said I must see his mother , he went away and brought two women; said I, is either of these your mother? he answered no; but said they could prove he was an honest boy; he told me he lived in Jacob's Well-yard in East Smithfield; I went there, but could find nothing of his mother, I stop'd the copper, and the Prosecutor swore to it as his property .

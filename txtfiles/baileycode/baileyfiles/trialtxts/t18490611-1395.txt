1395. 




NATHANIEL WALLACE
 was again indicted

for stealing 23 window-sashes, value 3l., the goods of 



John Gover: having been before convicted.






JOHN COOK
. On 30th April, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner take a truck, loaded with twenty-three sashes, up the hill—he

was one of the men who drew it—when I first saw him he was about twenty yards from Mr. John Gover's house—I followed the truck and counted the sashes—I believe them to be Mr. Gover's—they were similar to his; it was about seven o'clock in the morning.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRT. Q. You never saw the sashes till they were there? A. No.





WILLIAM HUNT
. On 30th April, or 1st May, I saw the prisoner come down the hill with a truck, take the sashes out of the house, and load them in the truck—I pointed out the house.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you near the house? A. About fifty yards off; the prisoner could see me if he had looked—there are five houses—Mr. Cook's house is near Mr. Gover's—I could see these were taken from Mr. Gover's.





CHARLES CLARK
 (policeman, P 108). Hunt pointed out to me the house that the sashes came from, it was Mr. John Gover's—there are five unfinished houses; this is the third house—the sashes were deposited there, and locked up—I took the prisoner, and charged him with being concerned with another person in stealing some sashes belonging to Mr. Gover, he said he had not been there since Christmas—I produced this white cap, and Hunt said it was like the one the prisoner had on.





GEORGE STRUTT
. I locked up the house on the 7th, and gave the key to a Mr. Croker.





WILLIAM MORTEN
 (police-inspector). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted Nov., 1846, and confined six months)—he is the person; he had been tried a month before that with another person.




GUILTY
.† Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

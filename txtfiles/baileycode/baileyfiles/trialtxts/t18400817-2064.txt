WILLIAM FRICKER
. I live in Surrey-place, Gray's-Inn-road. About six o'clock in the evening of the 18th of July I was in Covent-Garden market—the officer came and spoke to me—I put my hand into my pocket and missed my handkerchief which I had used two or three minutes before—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE
Q. Do you know it by any mark? A. Yes.





THOMAS BLOSSET
. I am officer of Covent-Garden market. About six o'clock on the 18th of July I saw the prisoners in company attempt a gentleman's pocket—they then went to the prosecutor, and Jones took something from his pocket—I went to the prosecutor—I took Jones about an hour and a half after, but found nothing on him—I did not see what he did with the handkerchief.





RICHARD MOORE
. I saw the prisoners in Covent-Garden. I saw Jones go to a gentleman's pocket and attempt to pick it, and Blitzo was covering him—I took Blitzo—I saw him put his right hand to his breast, and found this handkerchief there.

(Thomas Betts, shoemaker, North-street, Whitechapel-road; and John Lilly, a butcher, in Mile End, New Town, gave Jones a good character.)

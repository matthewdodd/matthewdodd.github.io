            . I am concerned in the Carpenters and Joiners Joint Stock
. Word was sent to our Compting-house, that some of the Company's Timber was in Earle's Court. I went and found two Pieces there with the Company's Mark, which was a Triangle, in the Possession of 
               
                  William 
                  Smith 
               



            , who said he bought it of the Prisoner.

                  Cox 
               



            . I am Clerk to the Company - I miss'd two Pieces of Timber from Stangate, a little on this side Lambeth




, and found 'em at Earle's Court.


                  William 
                  Smith 
               



            . At eight or nine times I bought about Ten Load of Timber of the Prisoner, but the Mark was disfigured. I gave him from 25 s. to 30 s. a Load for it. He was recommended to me by 
               
                  James 
                  Taylor 
               



            , a Carpenter of Hammersmith; I live at Kensington - I was to give him about 14 l. for the whole Parcel, and would not give much more now.
Prisoner. But I never received half the Money.


                  James 
                  Theobald 
               



            . We had lost several Pieces of Timber, and hearing that some Pieces which had been stolen were at Earle's-Court, we went thither, and found one Piece there, close to a House that Smith was building. It was mark'd P T and the Mark is fair to this Hour. We bought 600 l. worth at a time, of Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Thompson 
               



            , and gave him 38 s. a Load for it; and Smith bought it of the Prisoner at the Rate of 25 s.


                  Leonard 
                  Philips 
               



            . I keep some Timber at White-hall, some at the Green-house at Batter-sea-Field, and some at Chelsea. I lost some of that at Chelsea




, and found two Pieces at Earle's-Court; they were mark'd L P; one of the Marks was plain, and the other was scratch'd, tho' not so much as to make the Letters undistinguishable. I was the first that made the Discovery; I ask'd Smith how he came by the Pieces? He said, he bought them of a Waterman. Looking farther, I saw some of Mr. Theobald's Timber, and some belonging to the Company. In one of the Pieces the Mark was cut out with an Adz - Mine cost me 31 s. a Load.

Prisoner. I have taken up Timber in the River for these Gentlemen several times, and always carry'd it home to them; but these Pieces I found upon the Salt Water, and the Marks not being Plain, I did not know who they belong'd to, and so I sold them to Mr. Smith. 

               Guilty of all three indictments
            .

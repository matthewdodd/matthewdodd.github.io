            . I am a bombazeen manufacturer
. On the evening of the 26th of March, I was in Holborn


 about seven o'clock, I perceived my handkerchief being torn from my pocket; I immediately seized the person by the collar that I suspected doing it. When I had hold of him he gave it to the prisoner at the bar; I let go of the person that I had hold of, and followed the prisoner. I seized him by the collar and demanded my handkerchief; he said, if it was mine I should have it. He took it from his pocket and said he had just picked it up in the street. I took him into a shop and sent for a constable. That is all that passed.

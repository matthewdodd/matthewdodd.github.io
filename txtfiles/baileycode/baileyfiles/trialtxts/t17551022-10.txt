            . I was not in the way when the handkerchiefs were taken out of my shop, but I saw the prisoner before the justice, and the handkerchiefs, 15 or 16, my property. He said he took them in order to fit himself for sea, and that he took them out of my-shop; the handkerchiefs are my property.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor, (he produces 15 handkerchiefs.) I missed these immediately upon there being taken, and took the prisoner before he was gone from the shop-window, and took them out of his bosom. They are Mr. Price's property, they have been in my custody ever since.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going to Wapping, and saw the handkerchiefs lying on the ground, and picked them up.

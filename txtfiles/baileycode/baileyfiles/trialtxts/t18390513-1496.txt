EDMUND CHICHELY
. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 3rd of May, about one o'clock in the day, J met the prisoner in Chapel-street, Pentonville, with the large trowel in a handkerchief under his arm—I asked where he got it—he said from his father's, in Anderson-buildings, City-road, and in a moment he said, "I bought it of a man in Brick-lane"—I took him to the station-house, and found a small trowel in his coat-pocket—in the evening the prosecutor identified them both—I took him about a mile from, where they were lost.





JOHN WINTER BOURNE
. I am a bricklayer. These are my trowels—I left them in the back-parlour, of an empty house at twelve o'clock when I went to dinner—when I returned they were gone—there was a painter at work in the house—I don't know, the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the street, and a person asked if I would buy them.

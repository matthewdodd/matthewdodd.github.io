JOSEPH POOLE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of May, 2 half-crowns, 3 shillings, and 2 sixpences, and 1 groat, the monies of 



Joseph Hilton.






JOSEPH HILTON
. I live in Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green—the prisoner slept with me for a week—I went to bed on Saturday night, the 29th of April, at twelve o'clock, and was awoke by some one knocking at the door, and Mr. Mullins let the prisoner in—he came to bed—I awoke again very early, and, heard the church clock strike four—the prisoner got up in bed, and was pulling my trowsers over the bed—I asked what he wanted, he said he was cold—he pulled them up towards the head, and laid down—in a few minutes he got up again—I saw him dressing, and when he was going down he pitched my trowsers on the wall side—I had had two half-crowns, three shillings, two sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece in them, and when I got up, my money was gone—when he pulled my trowsers across the bed I heard the silver rattle in them.

Prisoner. Q. What did you say when I got up? A. I asked what you wanted.





FRANCIS WHITE
. I took the prisoner on the Monday afternoon—I found 5s. 8d. on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing by the door where the prosecutor lodges; I went in and got a lodging there, on the Saturday evening I received my money. I had got 6s. in my pocket; it was my jacket that I pulled over me, as it had rolled off; the prosecutor knows I was paid.






JOSEPH HILTON

re-examined, I do not know that he had any money of his own that night—he left about five o'clock in the morning.

            .
JOSHUA RAWLINSON. I am a clerk
 in the City. On Sunday evening, the 13th of June, I was in the Edgware-road


; I felt a tug at my pocket, turned, and saw the prisoner putting something into his pocket - he ran off; I ran and pursued him; I gave him a thump with my umbrella; he ran among a flock of sheep, and as soon as they were gone, I saw my handkerchief on the ground, in the track he had run; I know it is mine.
Prisoner. There were plenty more boys. Witness. No, not near you.
Prisoner's Defence. This is the first time I was ever placed in a situation so distressing and grievous to myself and my parents; I have only to petition you will look on the circumstances of my case with merciful consideration; if I should be restored to my father, my future good conduct shall show that I am sensible of my past faults.

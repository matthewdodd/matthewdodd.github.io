ANN MUNRO
. I live in Grosvenor-place, and am a grocer. On the 31st of October, about eight o'clock, I missed a box, four sixpences, and eight shillings—this is the box—(looking at one.)





JOHN LEGG
. I was on duty about a quarter before eight o'clock that evening, and saw Elliot go down on his hands into the prosecutrix's shop-Hazler was outside for a quarter of an hour talking to him opposite the window before he went in—Elliot came out and joined Hazier again—I went up and asked what they were doing in the shop, they said, "Nothing"—I found the box in Elliot's pocket, with the money in it, not three minutes after I saw him go round to the till.

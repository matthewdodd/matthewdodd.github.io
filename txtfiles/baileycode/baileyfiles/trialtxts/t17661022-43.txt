. On the 27th of last month the prisoner came to our house to assist my wife as a nurse; the day following I missed my buckles, they were iron plated with silver; she was at my house a fortnight within a night; the day after she was gone, I missed a garnet ring; on the Monday following I went and got a search warrant of Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; I found my buckles in her room, and some other things that my wife can swear to; they were in a box which she denied to be hers, but afterwards I found the key of it on a bunch of keys which the had; (the bucket, in pot, and turn-screw produced and deposed to; the clout and a linen cap produced; Catharine his wife, deposed to them as her property.)
Andrew Anderson, the constable, deposed to the finding the things in the prisoner's room.

            . Last Saturday I went to drink tea with Mrs. Odell; she went into the yard about seven o'clock, at which time I saw the prisoner come and put her hand over the counter, and opened the till, but did not see what she took; I charged her; Mrs. Odell could not open her hand for a good while; my husband was by, he helped to open it, there were two sixpences in it; she said she had the two sixpences from a person in the Fleet-market; but when she went to the Counter, she owned she took them out of the till; she is a basket-woman
 in the market, and sometimes chairs
 for Mrs. Odell.

            . Mrs. Parker said, That wicked creature has put her hand over the counter, and took out your till, and taken something out; we went to her before she had time to put the till in again; I charged her with taking something; she said, I robbed you of nothing; I said, it looks to me as if you had something in your hand; I took hold of her hand, she had a pot in it; I took it out, but she would not open her hand; Mr. Parker came and helped me, then we found two sixpences in it; she said she had earned them with her own precious hands; but when before the Alderman, she owned she took them from my till.
Prisoner's defence.
I never wronged mortal in my life since I was born, before this time; I am sorry for it; God bless my master and mistress.

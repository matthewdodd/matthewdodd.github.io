The prosecutor is a carpenter
; The prisoner worked with him, the prosecutor happened to find his coat to be heavy, as he went to move it from the place where it was laid. He look'd and found there was this quantity of nails; he let them abide there. When the prisoner was going to dinner with his coat on, his master stopped him in the street, and sent for a constable; they were found in his pocket, and he own'd it to his master on his knees, and asked pardon.
The prisoner in his defence said, he was going to Tower-street to use them in a job for his master. The prosecutor to that said, there were no men employed in Tower-street at that time. He said he had a job there, but he would not have wanted that quantity, and there were flooring brads in his pocket, tho' no flooring to be done in the job.

HANNAH ARNOLD
. I am the wife of George Arnold, and keep a glove shop. On the 15th of November, the prisoners came to my shop, between six and seven o'clock in the evening-Murrell asked for some braces, and my husband showed them some—I was in the parlour—my husband rang for me—I looked through the parlour window, and saw Medhurst take off his hat, take three handkerchiefs out of the window, put them in his hat, and put his hat on again-Murrell was at the other counter, four or five yards off—I came round by the passage, went into the shop, and took Medhurst's hat off—I took the handkerchiefs out, and got a policeman—they were both given in charge.

Medhurst. I had them in my hand, and was going to ask the price of them. Witness. No, you took your hat off, put them in, and put your own handkerchief on them.





HENRY SIMPSON
 (police-constable S 24.) I took the prisoners.





JAMES SOUNDY
 (City police-constable No. 53.) I produce the certificate of Medhurst's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—Medhurst is the man who was convicted—he had four months' imprisonment.

8th of January, 1 pair of boots, value 2s. 9d., the goods of

CHARLES THOMAS SCOTCHFORD
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Salmons-lane, Limehouse. On the 8th of January, about ten o'clock, I went out, leaving these boots on a nail, and when I returned they were stolen—theseare them—the shop door was not quite closed.





THOMAS CHARLES SCOTCHFORD
. I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, the door was about two or three inches open—in consequence of something my brother had said to me, I watched the shop, he had not been out many minutes when I heard a slight noise, as if the door was opened—I went into the shop, saw the door open, and missed a pair of boots—I ran into the street, some men said, "There they go, there are three of them"—I saw three running—the prisoner was one of them—I saw Davis stop him.





JOHN DAVIS
 (police-constable K 94.) About twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, on the 8th of January, I was going up Margaret-street, Limehouse—I saw the prisoner and another man running—Scotchford immediately came up and said, "I give this man in charge for stealing a pair of boots"—I pursued and took him—I found this pair of boots in his coat-pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. I went down to Limehouse to get work; I saw these boots lying under a window-ledge, I picked them up, and put them into my pocket.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice William.

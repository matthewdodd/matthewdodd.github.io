I am a currier
: on the 10th of this month, I lost some dog skins, about six, they were hanging in a back shed to dry; I missed them about eight; I did not see them taken; on Wednesday morning, the 14th, I was sent for to Mr. Badland's, and saw my skins at the Justice's; they were marked with an iron mark; I am sure they are mine.

I am a shoe-maker; on the 13th, about six in the evening, the prisoner Joseph came to me, and said he knew a person had some dog skins, who was in trouble, and I might have them as a bargain; I said if they were honestly come by, I would buy them; I have seen the prisoner Joseph before; he is a shoe-maker; he came again between eight and nine, and brought the other prisoner with him, and Robert pulled them out of a bag, and asked nineteen shillings for them, and I saw Mr. Cooke, and he said they were stolen, and belonged to Mr. Matthews; the prisoners wanted to get away, and we secured them; the tall one and me fell down in the street; he got clear of me, and run down the lane, and was stopped.
Did they tell you how they came by the skins? - No.
(The skins produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER JOSEPH'S DEFENCE.
I had been at work all day, and I went out with a pair of shoes for my master; I told him I was going home; he said, I should be obliged to you call on a Mr. Gray; and coming home, in the field near the Dog and Duck, I picked up the bag with these skins; I kept them till Tuesday; I thought they would be advertised; I carried some to Mr. Badland's, and he said they were stolen.
PRISONER ROBERT'S DEFENCE.
I went with this young man to Shire-lane, and he went to Mr. Badland's; Inever saw the skins, nor touched them; I can prove that on the 10th, I was at work; I was not out of my own house from the Tuesday, till between ten and eleven on the Sunday, then I cleaned myself to go to church.

Prisoner Robert. I can prove I was at home, and at work at the time that Mr. Matthews says these things were stolen.

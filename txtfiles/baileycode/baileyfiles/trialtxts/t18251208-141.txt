            . I am servant to Mr. Mason, who keeps the Running Horse, Piccadilly


. On the 30th of November, about two o'clock, Mr. George Gould's gig stood there. I saw the prisoner go and take the coat out of the gig - he put it under his left arm, ran down the yard, and out of the gateway; I cried Stop thief! he threw it down at the corner of Dover-street, seeing some persons following him. I returned, and picked it up. I am certain of his person.
Prisoner. Q. Where were you when I came out of the yard? A. I was on the box, and got down as fast as I could - you threw the coat down before two ladies. I was in the yard when you were brought back.

            . I am a coachman. Between two and three o'clock on the 30th of November I heard the cry of Stop thief! I pursued the prisoner, and overtook him in Harford-street; he said he had done nothing, and I had no business to detain him. I took him back to the yard.

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running; Holmes knocked him down; I assisted in securing him.

            . I keep the Running Horse. I know Mr. George Gould - I should have been responsible for this coat if it had not been found.
Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.

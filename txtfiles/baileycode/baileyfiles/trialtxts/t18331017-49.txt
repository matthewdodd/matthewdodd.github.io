            . I am a hackney-coachman
 - the prisoner is my only child
; he is between eleven and twelve years old - on the 24th of September I called him up, at seven o'clock in the morning, to light the fire and get breakfast; this money was in my coat pocket; he slept in the same room with me; I fell asleep again, and at half-past seven o'clock I awoke, and missed my money; the prisoner was then gone, and I did not see him for a fortnight, when I met him in the street, and asked how he came to rob me; he said, he did not know - he has robbed me six or seven different times - I have tried every means of reclaiming him.

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; the prisoner is my son - I got up that morning at half-past six o'clock - I felt the money then safe in my husband's pocket.

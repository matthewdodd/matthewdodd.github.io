186. 




JOHN HARVEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of Nov., 6lbs. weight of ham, value 3s., the goods of 



Henry Garrett; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM HELLEWELL
. I am in the service of Mr. Henry Garrett, a cheesemonger—he lives in St. George the Martyr, Southwark. On the 14th of Nov. I placed two half hams inside the window at seven o'clock—I do not remember seeing them after that—I saw the prisoner at ten minutes before ten o'clock, about twenty yards from our window, with one of the half hams in his possession—I walked towards him—he saw me, and placed the half ham down by the side of a gateway—he walked on a short distance—I took up the ham, and was returning with it in my apron—the prisoner passed me, and I gave him into custody.





MARY WILKINSON
. I am the wife of Joseph Wilkinson. On that evening I saw the prisoner take the ham out of the window which was open—he laid it down by the gateway, then came a few yards towards me, and turned back, and the young man directly gave him into custody.





JAMBS PERRY
 (police-constable M 60.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from the clerk of the Peace of Surrey—(read)—"Convicted on the 16th of March, 3rd Vict.; and transported for seven years"—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years
.

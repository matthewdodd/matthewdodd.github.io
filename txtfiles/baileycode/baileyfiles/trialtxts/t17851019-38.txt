, I lost these things the 20th of September, I found the prisoner in my shop by my counter, I asked him what he wanted, he said a pennyworth of bell-staples, I put them into a paper, and gave them to him; he was going away, my servant seeing him going away, went and took the parcel from between his legs as he was going out, there were six pair of hinges in the parcel.

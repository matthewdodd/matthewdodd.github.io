HARRIETT LAKE
. I am the wife of john Lake—I had six half-crowns, six shillings, two sovereigns, and a watch—about half-past five o'clock in the evenings of the 2nd of February, I put them into a cupboard in the boat we were in, and missed four half-crowns about the prisoner, and found him with four half-crowns on him—we had employed him that day—he said he had no money, and not a bit of victuals.





RICHARD THOMPSON
. I found the prisoner in Mr. Cooper's hovel at the lime-kilns the same evening—he said he had not got the money—I searched him, and could not find it at first—I afterwards found it in his hat—I found this windlass on the bank, where he had thrown it.

Prisoner's Defence. He said he would deliver me if I gave up the money.





JOHN ATKINS
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Anthony Tindal, Clerk of the Peace for the county of Bucks—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then tried and convicted.

I am a brewer

 in Maiden-lane, in the Borough. On Monday morning, the 21st of January, the watchman that was on the beat in Brooke's Market came to inform me that a house, which I have in Brooke's Market, the Three Jolly Butchers


, had been broke open, they had taken some young fellows in it, and had taken some lead off the premises.
JEHU WARD sworn.
I was watchman in Brooke's Market. On the 21st of January, my partner called to me, and said, Ward, here is a cellar window open. He is ill he, is not able to attend here, he is in the hospital; accordingly I went over to him, and we knocked the people of the house up, this was in Brooke's Market, I went down into that cellar after the people were up, and I could find nothing at all in it; accordingly I saw three or four bars of the grates broke up, I said there was somebody in the Three Jolly Butchers; accordingly I went further up, and I heard a great knocking in the house; accordingly I went to the door, and there was a padlock on the door, on the outside; accordingly we agreed on it to pull our coats off, and to go down into the cellar to see who were there in the house, and I went away up into Gray's Inn-lane, and I turned my rattle for assistance; assistance came,

                   May
               



            , a bye man came down. My partner's name was Welch, me, and Welch, and May, went down, we went and searched all the house over, and found nobody at all in it; we came out again, and thought we would acquaint the inhabitants to be cautious, because there were thieves about; all we came out, and the prisoner Hoyland came to the fore door in the inside, and cried thieves; the fore door was shut, and the padlock outside, he said, there was thieves in the house, we shall all be murdered: We then went down again into the cellar, the same way as we came up, and when we came into the passage, I found young Hoyland in the passage of the tap-room, he says to me, my brother is in the yard, I looked round in the yard, and I could see nobody at all, and then Lee brought a ladder, and Lee got over, and he turned Tisdell over, and we took them out, and we took them two to the watch-house;I never saw Thomas till I came to the watch-house; when I got into the house, I saw a piece of lead lay on the table of the tap room; the lead is here, I looked at it, there is no appearance of its being cut; there was the print of the lead where they brought it down stairs from the top of the house, where they rested it, it is above half an hundred weight; the next morning we went to the place, and it appeared to be taken from the top of the house; I did not see any left at that part, it was part of a gutter, the whole of the gutter was gone; when I went into the cellar the next morning, I found another piece with a pipe to it.
EDD LEE sworn.
I am a watchman, I was on watch this 21st of January; 
               
                  Ward
               


             the watchman in Brooke's Market turned his rattle for assistance, I went to see what was the matter, he said, there was an alarm of some thieves, he supposed they were in the Jolly Butchers public house, in Brooke's Market, I went with him to see what was the matter, there was a cellar broke open by somebody; not the cellar belonging to the Three Jolly Butchers.
Davis. I have a cellar under another house, which has no communication with the house, it is under, but goes directly into that public-house.
Lee. Welch, May, and Ward, forced up the flap belonging to the Jolly Butchers, and went down that way, while they were down there Fincher, another watchman and I stood above, we stayed above to watch this cellar window, while they were down there, it appeared to me, that this here cellar, that is broke open belonged to the green-stall: I told Fincher to stop there a bit, and I would go down this place to see how the cellars were; accordingly I got down the cellar that was broke open, and went down into the cellar, when I went down, I found it had no connection with the green stall, but was an arched cellar, which came into the street, I then went from that into another arch, and from that to another; there were three arches; and then I got to the cellar which belongs to the Jolly Butchers, then I went up the cellar stairs, and I went into the tap room, and in the tap room I saw one of these pieces of lead rolled up, and laying on the table, I did not look any further then into the house, but went down the cellar stairs again, and got out into the street, and I told Fincher, the other watchman, how the cellars were, that they were connected all in one; Fincher said, he would go and stand at the corner, in case if there was any body they would come out backward there from the other houses; I took my lanthorn, and set it down by the cellar that was broke open, and I went and stood by this flap of the cellar of the Jolly Butchers, they were about five or six yards apart; while I was there I saw Davy Thomas, the prisoner, come out of that cellar, its him that stands in the middle, he goes by the name of Davy, I have known him many years, he came out of that cellar that was broke open, I seeing the man come out, I made up to him as fast as I could, just as he was rising from the cellar, I caught hold of him, I said, Davy, I believe I have got you, with a sudden jerk he snatched himself out of my hand, and ran up the market; he out ran me, Fincher and May, was very handy to him, I told them to run after him, and I went back to the cellar, I had been at the cellar about two minutes, and May brought him back to me, and I said take him to the watch-house, he is the man that came out of the cellar, and they took him to the watch-house, I stood at the cellar for a great while, I suppose for an hour, until such time as I heard Ward say, Lee come down, we have got one here, I went down directly as hecalled me, with a ladder, which we borrowed at the green stall, and went up the cellar stairs, as soon as I got up on the top of the cellar in the passage, I saw Ward had hold of Hoyland, the prisoner, Ward said, go into the yard, I heard an alarm in the yard, I took the ladder with me, the yard is surrounded with houses, and there is a partition at one corner partitioned off, this partition is about six or seven feet high; the inhabitants were looking out of their windows, some of them said, that they saw a man get out of the Jolly Butchers, back door, and get over that partition, and they said, it was impossible for him to go through that way, and as they had not seen him come back, that he must be there now; accordingly I got over, and I found that in the yard there was a little fowl house built, and I looked about in the yard, and up in the corner, between that and the partition, I saw the prisoner, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Tisdell
               



            , he was not down nor properly up, but like down on one hand and knee, I asked him what business he had there, he did not give me any answer, I desired him to get over the partition back again, the other watchmen came up and they took him.
Prisoner. I wish to know whether the lead fitted or no? - I don't know.

                   MAY
               



             sworn.
I was one of the watchmen, I went into the house along with Ward and Welch, I went all over the house, and out upon the house, we could find nobody; Ward and I came back, and I put my lanthorn on the parapet gutter and stood still; I went and searched for them, and could not find them, on that we all came out of the house again; I went down into Leather-lane, and Lee called out there is one got out, and he told me Fincher was gone after him, I ran after Fincher, he saw him run up a pair of stairs, called the Hole in the Wall passage, I ran up these pair of stairs, and catched him at top in the passage, it is a pair of stairs belonging to a house, it has no under floor nor street door at all, I asked him what he did there? he said, it was his lodging, I laid hold of him, and told him I would help him to a better lodging, I took him back to Lee, and he said, that was the man.
Court to Lee. How long had you known Thomas? - I have known him about six years, he is a butcher I believe, his mother lived a neighbour to me some years, I don't know a he served his time to any thing; I saw him every night at Gray's Inn-lane, at a house of slight character among bad people.
Court to May. Did you see this lead sitted? - I did, both the pieces, they were sitted to the back part of the house over the garret window, in what they call a fillet gutter, one piece fitted very well.
Prosecutor. I employed two men on Thursday the 24th, to fit this lead, I saw them fit one part, that has the pipe to it, a very remarkable piece of lead, and it appeared to fit; but, my Lord, I have to observe, that the two plumbers that I employed, they cut off these two little pieces of lead from the others, and threw them down; one plumber was endeavouring to fit the lead on the outside of the house, and the other was inside of the house in the garret; I walked from one side of the house to the other, presently came down one of these rolls of lead, as if it had been rolled up, in a very little time while the watchman was present came another; I don't know whether it is fair to mention it, there was some little bribe.
- KING sworn.
I am a carpenter, I was there when the lead was fitted in the gutter, and it all fitted exactly, I don't know the day.
Q. Where did you get the lead that you fitted there? - The watchman had it of Lee; I got it from the office, Hatton-garden, and the two plumbers had it of me.

Ward. The lead that we found in the house, me and May carried to the office; it was never carried to Mr. Davis's.
Lee. I locked it up in my house, and it was carried afterwards to be fitted, I went with them and took it to the house.
King. I saw it fitted, and helped the man to fit it; it fitted exactly, these pieces that were pulled off, they all came certainly from that place.
Prisoner Hoyland. I was coming by this place, going across the market and was going home.
Prisoner Thomas. I was coming home late from Lambeth, and I heard this man cry out there goes one.
Prisoner Tisdell.

             and I were out drinking sixpennyworth of crank together; we went into Gray's Inn-lane, as I lay in the Jolly Butcher's house before, I went in there, and I went into the back yard, and went to sleep.

Q. Where did this conversation take place? - At the justice room.
Court. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have known Hoyland ever since he was a child; I have known his father this thirty years.
The prisoner Hoyland called five witnesses who gave him a good character.
The prisoner Thomas called one witnes who gave him a good character.
The prisoner Tisdell called two witnesses who gave him a good character.

            . I lodge in Ossulston-street, Somers'-town


, in the front parlour. On the 14th of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I lost this gown out of my parlour, and found it at the watch-house.

            . I live nearly opposite the prosecutrix. I was at the window, and saw two men go up the street, about a quarter before nine o'clock; they stopped at No. 67, the other man went in, the prisoner went on, and stood at the corner of the street; the other came out without any thing - the prisoner then went in himself, came out, and joined his companions. The prisoner went in again, and came out with his apron tucked up - it was down before. I sent my husband after him.

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutrix's house with his apron tucked up, and his coat buttoned up - he had a bundle under his arm, and joined his companion. I followed, calling Stop thief, and secured him; he had dropped the bundle. I asked him what he had done with it? he said he knew nothing about it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

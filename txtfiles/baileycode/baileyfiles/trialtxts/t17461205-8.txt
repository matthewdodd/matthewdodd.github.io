            . I was crossing Fetter-lane


 the 12th of November, between Three and Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, I felt something press very close to me: I put my Hand in my Pocket, and I immediately missed my Snuff-box. I took hold of the Prisoner, she pretended to buckle her Shoe, and dropped the Snuff box behind her.
Q. What was your Snuff-box?
Kerton. Tortoise shell, with a Silver Rim.

            . On the 12th of November, Mr Kerton came to my Door; I keep an Oil-shop the Corner of Fetter-lane; says he, this Woman has just pick'd my Pocket; I said, why do not you take her up, upon which he took hold of her, and I saw her drop it.
The Prisoner utterly denied the Fact, and said there was a Woman and a Boy along with her: but the Prosecutor declared he saw none. She said she had Witnesses, but they were gone.



               Guilty

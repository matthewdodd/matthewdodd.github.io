            . I lost this spoon last Tuesday was three weeks. I had not missed it above an hour when my neighbour, Mr. Bootle, a constable, brought the prisoner to me, whom he had taken into custody for offering to sell him my spoon.
- Bootle. The prisoner came into my house; he told me he had a spoon to sell, and produced this spoon: he asked fifteen shillings for it; he said it was worth twenty-five; then he said it was worth twenty-three shillings; then he said it was worth a guinea. I got a stick in order to be able to master him if he made any resistance. Then I examined him again; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had a brother a butcher; that he went to him for some money, that he would give him none, therefore he took away the spoon: I seized him and cut down his breeches to prevent his making his escape. I told him I would carry him before a magistrate; then he declared he had taken it from the next publick house. I carried him down to Mr. Harnan; he owned the spoon.
(The spoon produced and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I am a day labouring man. I found this spoon amongst some turnep pairings as I was going to Barnet.

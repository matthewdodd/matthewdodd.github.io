            . On Wednesday, the 31st of October, about twelve at noon, I saw the prisoner and two others standing near the door of Mr. Vandepool, in East Smithfield


. I saw the prisoner take six shovels that were standing at Mr. Vandepool's door, exposed to sale. I saw the prisoner again on the 5th of November, and took him in custody. I am sure he is the man.

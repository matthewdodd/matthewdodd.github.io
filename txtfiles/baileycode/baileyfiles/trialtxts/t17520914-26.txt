            , were indicted for 


               stealing one hog, val. 15 s.
             the property of

            . I live near Mud-dock, in Rotherhith



, and lost a sow pig in the night between the 1st and second of June. I shut her up, and heard my dog bark, and my pig squeak, between twelve and one. The pig had a spot or two upon her; one was near the head, and another on the side. I had four pigs.

                  Robertson 
               



            . The two prisoners cut the stye down where the hog was. I think it was between the first and second day of June, and between twelve and one in the night. They took away a pig of about eight or nine stone, with a black spot on the rump, and another below its eye. I have fed it many a time. I stood to see the man did not come out of his house. They took it by the tail and ran it into a boat; we then carried it to 
               
                  James 
                  Penprice 
               



            's house, by the Three Cups near the bridge, in St. Paul's, Shadwell; the pig gave a squeak or two, and the dog barked. It was kept at Penprice's house about three weeks, in a stye where he laid sand; and afterwards was killed by Cook, a butcher. I discovered it to Mr. Chapman voluntarily, and am not in custody now.


                  William 
                  Cook 
               



            . I am a butcher. I killed a hog for Penprice, about the latter end of June; this might weigh about eight or nine stone.
Q. from Penprice. Ask him if he has not known me buy pigs in Smithfield for my family?
Cook. I have.
Robertson. The butcher suspected the pig to have been stolen at the time he killed it. I was there, when Perry cut the hair off the back, and said there was a Smithfield mark upon it.

                  Jennings 
               



            . I am headborough. I know Robertson, Penprice, and Perry, and have frequently seen them all three together, when I came off the watch.

                  Barret 
               



            . I have seen Penprice and Robertson in company together, when I have come off my watch.
Penprice's Defence.
It is a malicious prosecution of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Taylor 
               



            ; there has been a quarrel between me and him.

                  Taylor 
               



            . Far from it. I have often seen these three prisoners together.
Perry's defence.
I know nothing of the thing.

               Guilty
            .
(M.) Penprice was indicted a second time, for 


               stealing one hempen bag, val. 3 d. and eighty pounds weight of ginger, val. 45 s. the property of 
                     
                        
                           Nicholas 
                           Burnhill 
                        



                      
                   in a certain lighter lying on the river Thames
            .


                  Nicholas 
                  Burnhill 
               



            . I am commander of the 
                  
                     Augustus 
                     Caesar 
                  




. She lay at Bell Wharf, a little below Ratcliff Cross



, and a lighter lay by the side of her. There were several bags of ginger on board; I missed two bags, one marked I.S.S. No. 3, the other T.B.O. A bag full, marked I.S.S. No. 3, produced in court. We lost one with this mark and number ; but I know not whether from on board the ship or lighter.


                  Francis 
                  Chamney 
               



            . I am mate of this vessel. We had many hundred bags of ginger on board. Some of them were put on board one lighter, and some another, on the 8th or 9th of July. One was missed about the 11th, marked I.S.S. No. 3. (He looks on that produced, and says he believes it to be the same.)


                  Thomas 
                  Barnes 
               



            . I was standing in Thomas Edwards's yard on Bell Wharf, on the 8th of July, between eleven and twelve in the day; I saw a boat betwixt the ship 
               
                  Augustus 
                  Caesar 
               



             and a lighter, and a person in a blue gray coat take a bag and heave it into the boat; he was in the lighter. There was only one man in the boat. I was about 100 yards distance; the lighter lay on the shore side; it was a coarse bag. I saw a boat go on shore at Storehouse yard, with one 
               
                  Owen 
                  Clark 
               



             in it. I then got into my boat, and rowed to Storehouse yard, and saw the bag marked S. S. I. No. 3. I saw it was ginger through a hole in the bag; I also saw it in the boat, and the man carry it on his back into Storehouse yard ; 
               
                  James 
                  Herrington 
               



             followed me. I then came back to Bell Wharf; Penprice came there in another boat, and ran up stairs; but I don't know where he came from. He then had such a coat on as the man had that flung the bag into the boat, and by his dress, I believe he was the man; but can't be positive. He went to Storehouse yard, where the bag was put. I follow'd him to an house there, where I saw the bag, marked as before; it was just by the door, which was open before he went to it. He went into the house; the bag stood on its end, he hove it down and took two pieces of ginger out, saying it was of the right sort, and would fetch them about an ounce a piece. He asked then who would stand porter, and 
               
                  James 
                  Herrington 
               



             said he would not, but 
               
                  William 
                  Robertson 
               



             said he would. Penprice then put it on Robertson's back, and they walked up the yard, the mark and number lying uppermost; I followed them, and Penprice said, Stop, let us turn the mark downwards; which they did. I followed them to Penprice's house, Shadwell, where the bag was carried down into the cellar. His house is about 300 yards from thence. I and 
               
                  James 
                  Herrington 
               



             went into his cellar, and Penprice said if I would hold my tongue, I should have my share; Herrington and Penprice talked together all the way going along. It was put into the chimney, and bran or saw-dust put over it. I came out and went to 
               
                  Richard 
                  Taylor 
               



            , an officer of the customs, and told him; after which I went down to the captain with the officer, and informed him of it, with the mark and number.


                  James 
                  Herrington 
               



            . I was in one boat the 8th of July, about eleven at noon, and the other witness in another, at Bell Wharf, for the purpose of plying. I observed a boat shove from between the ship and lighter, and saw a large bundle lying in the boat head; it went to Storehouse yard, and I followed it in mine. I saw the man of the boat take a bag on his shoulder, and carry it into Storehouse yard, to a house; the mark I do not know. but I saw No. 3, such a bag as this produced. I did not see him carry it into the house. I shoved my boat stern on shore. After he had taken the bag out of the boat he asked if it was my property; I said no. Penprice was then in a boat along with Robertson; not above a quarter of an hour after he came out of the boat, and asked me what it was. I told him I could not tell, but would go and see. Then I rowed my boat to Bell Wharf, and stoved her, and went to Storehouse yard, and saw the bag standing in a house. He followed us to the house I found to be Clark's. Penprice took it and turned it down, and said, This is the right sort; and asked who would be porter. I said I would not; he then asked Robertson, who said he would. He put it on Robertson's back, and he carried it to some distance, with the mark and number upwards, so he turned it downward. Then he carried it to Penprice's cellar, and put it into one corner, with saw-dust or bran out of a basket upon it.


                  Ann 
                  Austine 
               



            . The bag of ginger was brought into Clark's house on the 8th of July, betwixt ten and eleven in the day: it was set down on the right hand side, and had an I. and S. S. with a cross and figure of 3. I was there. Penprice followed it in about 5 minutes, with the 2 witnesses; those two stood at the door. Penprice turned the bag down, and breaking a hole put his finger in and took out some ginger, and said it was of the right sort; then broke a piece and flung it into the window. The numbers were towards the door when first set down.
Q. Was the bag of the size of this produced?
A. Austine. I think it was a little longer and whiter. He asked Herrington to carry it, and he refused it; then he asked Robertson, and he did; but in the middle of the yard, Penprice stopped him and turned the mark of the bag downwards.


                  Henry 
                  Crawford 
               



            . The ginger is worth about 7 or 8 d. per pound. He shewed me a race or two, and ask'd what it was worth a pound. I know there are two sorts, white and black; this is black.

Q. to Capt. Burnhill. What is the weight of these bags in common?
Burnhill. I don't know the weight; some weigh 100 and some 60 pounds. I don't know the value of this ginger.

            . I am clark to justice Bury.
Q. from Penprice. Do you remember my coming to give information, and for a warrant concerning a bag of ginger?
Rose. He came to me for a warrant against one 
               
                  Richard 
                  Taylor 
               



            , and said he had got a bag of ginger, and that Taylor had threatened to do some bodily harm to him, because he had stopped it; this was the 8th of July.
Q. Did he mention any thing against Clark?
Rose. No, he did not. My master said he would not grant this warrant on any condition, only on the account of some roguery being found out.

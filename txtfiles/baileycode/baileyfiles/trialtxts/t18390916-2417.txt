for stealing, on the

WILLIAM DUNCOMB ATTWOOD
. I live at Muswell-hill, Hornsey. On the 29th of August I was in Barbican, about five o'clock in the afternoon,—I had my pocket picked of my handkerchief, which I had seen safe about an hour before—this is it—there are no marks on it.





WILLIAM MANWARING LOVETT
. I was in Barbican, and saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from Mr. Attwood's pocket—he ran away—Mr. Attwood ran after him, and caught him in a public-house—the office came and took him—I am sure he is the man.





GEORGE FARROW
 (City police-constable, NO, 101.) I took the prisoner in the public-house—the handkerchief was lying close by him.




GUILTY
*. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

. On the 16th of November, between five and six o'clock, I was in the tap-room, and was called out - I found my boy in the court, holding the prisoner, who had a rush basket in his hand; I could see a pot in it - I took hold of him, and sent for an officer - he begged hard that I would forgive him, and let him go, but I have suffered so much I would not; he called me by name, and said he knew me very well - I found two pots in his basket; he had taken them out of my shed.
JAMES GREY. I am in Mr. Stennett's employ. I saw the prisoner in the shed - he had no business there; I stopped him with the pots in his basket.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

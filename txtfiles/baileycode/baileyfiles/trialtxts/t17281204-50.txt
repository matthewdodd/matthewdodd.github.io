            , of Acton


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Cock, and five Hens
            , on the First of November
 last, the Property of 
               
                  
                     Ann 
                     Lock 
                  




                
            .


                  John 
                  Barnet 
               



             depos'd, That the Cock and Hens were his Mistress's, and that they were taken from the Roost, on the 1st of November, and found upon the Prisoner the Day following.


                  John 
                  Whitehead 
               



             depos'd, That he being a Watchman, and seeing the Prisoner with a Sack upon his Back, and something in it, thought fit to examine him, when he said, he had Fowls there, at which this Deponent told him, he wanted such a Chap as he was, and thereupon took him into Custody.
The Fowls were produc'd in Court, and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Lock 
               



             Jun. depos'd, That they were her Mother's, which were taken away as aforementioned.
The Prisoner said in his Defence, That he had been at Uxbridge, and coming back, saw a Man with a Sack upon his Back, and upon his asking the Man what he had got there, he flung the Sack down, and ran away, that he took it up very innocently, and only for thus finding the Sack of Fowls, was taken into Custody; but as its much more common for Felons, to invent an Excuse, than to clear themselves by sufficient Evidence, these idle Tales are of little Effect, the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

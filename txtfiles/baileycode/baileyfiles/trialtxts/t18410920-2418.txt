2418. 




WILLIAM CHIFNEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of September, 1 10l. Bank-note, the monies of 



Benjamin Elam, his master, in his dwelling-house.






BENJAMIN ELAM
. I am a chemist, and live in Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone—the prisoner was my errand-boy. On last Friday I missed a 10l. Bank of England note from my cash-box—I am sure it was left in the cash-box, which I locked when I made up my cash on Wednesday morning—I sent for an officer, who spoke to the prisoner—he said he had picked it up in the back shop, under the desk, while sweeping it out—I cannot say that it was impossible I could have dropped it—it may have been the case.

JURY. Q. Were there any sovereigns in the box? A. Three or four sovereigns, but no silver.





THOMAS BRYAN
. I know the prisoner—I met him on Thursday—he told me he had a 10l. note—I asked him where he got it—he said, from his place—I told him he had better take it back—he said he could not—he gave it to me, and I gave it to Dawes.





ROBERT DAWES
. Brown gave me the note, and I gave it to Patterson—I was to change it, and have 10s.





WILLIAM PATTERSON
. I went to change the note at a linen-draper in Shoreditch—as I was coming along that way Dawes and Bryan offered me 10s. to change it.





JOHN CLARK
. I produce the note—Patterson came for a shirt, and offered it—I stopped it, thinking it was a forged one.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Ten Years—Parkhurst.

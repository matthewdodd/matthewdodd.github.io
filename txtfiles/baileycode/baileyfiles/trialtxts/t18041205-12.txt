: On the 4th of September last, my witness informed me that my cock was stolen from his walk; I heard there were some men in custody for stealing game cocks; there was notice given by several of the officers of Bow-street, desiring people that had lost fowls to come forward to own their own; I came forward, and owned one that was in the custody of Dunn, the officer.


                  JAMES

Q. Did you find this cock in the custody of these men? - A. Yes, they were altogether;

                  Hawkins
               



             had the cock in his hand; I assisted Holder in apprehending all the three prisoners; a man of the name of Groom came to me and said, I am glad you have got these three brothers.
Q. Are they three brothers? - A. Yes, by the mother's side.


                  JOHN 
                  HOLDER
               



             sworn. - Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, of Bow-street: I assisted Dunn in apprehending the three prisoners, on the 6th of November, I knew them all; I met these three brothers, and

            , and we took them to the office, I gave the cock to Dunn to keep; Mr. Bond gave us an order to go down to this French school, Mr. Brogilie's, at Kensington, and there I found fourteen live cocks and a dead one; the prisoners at the bar had sold most of them to the young gentlemen there.
Q. Are there any of the young gentlemen of Kensington here? - A. Yes.

             sworn. - Q. Were you at the academy at Kensington in November last? - A. I am not sure, I believe I was; I am not there now.
Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar; do you know them all three? - A. Yes.
Q. Were you in the habit of buying game cocks of these men? - A. We had some cocks before; they came at the end, when half our cocks were killed; we bought one of the two Hawkins's, and one of Field alone.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you bought the cocks, you did not keep them at school, you kept them out? - A. We had a bit of ground at the school, where we kept them separate.
Q. Do you mean to say whether that is the cock that you bought of the prisoner? - A. No.
Q.(To Rider.) What other witness have you got? - A. I have got 
               
                  William

             sworn. - Q. You had Rider's cock in your walk, had you? - A. Yes.
Q. Look at the cock, (the cock produced)? - A. That is the cock that I had, it belongs to Rider: I had that cock on the 4th of November last, I fedhim on that morning between ten and eleven o'clock, he was gone before three.
Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar; do you know them? - A. I saw them on Sunday morning, in a dirty dress, not becoming such men as them, at chapel-time; I saw them go through a passage at the corner of my house, one of them had a leather apron on like a farrier, or smith, this was between nine and ten o'clock, before I had fed the cock; they returned in about three quarters of an hour, I believe.
Q. You are sure you saw all the three together? - A. Yes.
Q. When did you first miss the cock? - A. About two o'clock; the fowls come in to get their victuals and pick with the children, they go to roost early; we drive them in because we lost some before.
Q. You are sure the cock, produced now, is Mr. Rider's cock? - A. Yes.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. They never attempted to touch any thing when you saw them? - A. Not that I saw.
Q.(To Rider.) Are you sure that is your cock? - A. Yes.

             sworn. - On Sunday morning, the 4th of November, I saw the three prisoners together, about half past ten o'clock, at Old Brompton; I followed them down to Little Chelsea-common, at the end next Sloane-square, I turned up to Brompton, and there I lost sight of them; they were going towards Stacey's house.
Q. You did not see them go up to his house? - A. No; on Tuesday following, I saw these three men facing Kensington workhouse, that is the day they were taken up, all three, with Rider's cock; then we took them up, with assistance, to Bow-street, Mr. Boud examined them; he granted an order for the master to send all the game cocks at the school; I saw them in about three quarters of an hour.

JOHN QUIGLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of November, 1 coat, value 2s.; 1 pair of breeches, value 1s.; 3 planes, value 6s.; 1 shirt, value 2s.; and 9 yards of fustian, value 6s.; the goods of 




Edward Byas and another.






EDWARD BYAS
. I am a farmer of parish poor at Stratford. This property belongs to myself and my partner—we have a joint interest in it—I lost it from the store-room—the prisoner had been in the house as a pauper

from the parish of Bromley, but was not there at the time these were taken—the property is here, and belongs to me—we had missed a great number of things, but had not missed these till they were produced on the 29th of January—we found some persons were taking things, from the house.





SARAH BRIDGWATER
. I keep a beer-shop, at No. 25, Green-street, Bethnal-green. This property was brought to my house—I do not know who brought it, but the prisoner took half a crown out of my till that morning, and I gave him in charge, but while I went for the officer they let him go—this bag was under the bench, but I do not know who brought it—I know the boy was in the house.





MARY BRIDGWATER
. I did not see the bag brought in, but the prisoner gave me the breeches and coat in the passage, and told me to mind them till three or four o'clock in the afternoon—they were given to the policeman.

Prisoner. It was not me—the boy that was with me gave them in, and he gave me 4d. to carry them.





WILLIAM SLADDEN
. I received these things at Mrs. Bridgwater's—I took the prisoner—he told me a man was to give him 2d. for minding them, and then he said he met a man who gave him 6d. for minding them.

Prisoner. I said the man gave 6d., that I went and had a pint of porter, and then I had 4d.—I know nothing of them.

JURY to MARY BRIDGWATER. Q. You state he gave you the breeches and coat? A. Yes, and nothing else.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM PARTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of December, 1 fowl, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



William Davies; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







GEORGE KEMP
. I am a policeman. On the 31st of December I met the prisoner, between one and two o'clock in the day, in Pearson-street, Kingsland-road, with this fowl in his hand—knowing him, I stopped him, and asked where he got it—he said he had bought it for 16d., and he had been to Haggerston fields to fight it—it was a hen—I detained him—he was about three minutes' walk from Davies's—he said if the fowl was not all right he would be b—d if I should take him.





WILLIAM DAVIES
. I am the son of William Davies, of Hackney-road. This is his fowl—he has had it going on for three years—I know it very well—I know nothing of the prisoner—he had no business with it—it was missed the morning it was found.





JAMES MILLER
. I am a policeman. I obtained this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was a witness on the trial—the prisoner is the person who was convicted of stealing a necklace from a child's neck.

Prisoner's Defence. On the Friday he took me in charge, he gave me to a policeman while he took a bundle to his house, and whispered in the ears of the policeman, "If you and me have him in charge too, we shall both get our expenses at the Old Bailey."





GEORGE KEMP

re-examined. There were three others in his company, and two escaped—I gave him to my brother officer while I pursued the other two.

Prisoner. I met a man who wanted to sell it—he wanted 1s. 6d. for it—I offered him 1s. 3d., and he took it—as I came across the fields, I met the other three lads—one was a bill-sticker—I was coming along with them, going towards home.

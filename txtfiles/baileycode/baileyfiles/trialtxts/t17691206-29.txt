John Green. Between four and five o'clock last Tuesday evening, I saw the two prisoners standing by a hogshead of tobacco on Dyce-Key


, which was going to be shipped for Yorkshire. I saw Martin cut the hoops that went a-cross, and Thomas filled his apron first, and went off with it; then Martin filled his apron and went off. I ran up the other gate-way, and took them both in Thames-street, and brought them back to the hogshead where they took it from.
The prisoners in their defence said they found the tobacco under the gate-way.

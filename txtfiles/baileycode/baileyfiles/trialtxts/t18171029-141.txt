ANN BEACH. I keep a snuff-shop
 in Long-acre


. On the 25th of October, at ten o'clock at night, I heard the door give a gentle crack. I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner, and another man, in the shop. I went into the shop, and saw the other man leaning over my counter, in the act of taking something. As I came into the shop he ran out with a jar of snuff-the prisoner asked me for a pennyworth of tobacco. I ran after the man - I could not find him; I returned, thinking the prisoner might rob me. I asked him why he let the man go out? he said he wanted a penny worth of tobacco. I had the prisoner taken up as an accomplice. He said he saw the jar under the man's arm, but he had no business with it.
THOMAS WALKER. I live with the prosecutrix. On the 25th of October, about ten o'clock at night, I obscrved the prisoner and two others lurking about the prosecutrix's window - I watched them - I looked very hard at the prisoner; they moved from the window. I went up stairs. Ihad not been up more than a minute before Mrs, Beach gave the alarm. I came down, and saw the prisoner in the shop. Mrs. Beach said she had lost a jar of snuff - I said I had seen the prisoner lurking about - I secured him. I am sure he is the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to get some tobacco.

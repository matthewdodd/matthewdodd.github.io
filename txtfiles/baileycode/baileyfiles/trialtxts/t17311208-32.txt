 last.
Mr. Chapel. I took a Place in the Oxford Coach at Uxbridge , and gave a Portmanteau to the Coachman, who put it behind. About Hillington , Mr. Lutwych look'd out of the Coach, and said, There's the One-ey'd Boy that has follow'd the Coach from Oxford. I think I have seen him try'd at Oxford. The Boy still follow'd , and coming into Town he got up behind. I look'd out several times, and saw him and the Portmanteau behind the Coach, but in Bondstreet I saw him running with the Portmanteau under his Arm. I call'd after him, bade the Coachman stop, and got out to pursue him, but he gave me the slip. On Thursday Night last he was taken in Lincolns-Inn Play-house, in attempting to pick the Pocket of Mr. Bulgress. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

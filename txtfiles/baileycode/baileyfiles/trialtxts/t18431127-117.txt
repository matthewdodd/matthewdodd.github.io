WILLIAM DEAN STEWART
. I am a porter, and live on Bread-street-hill. Between three and four o'clock, on the 9th of November, I went to see the Lord Mayor's show—I saw the two prisoners following a gentleman to the corner of Bridge-street—I there saw Nions take from his pocket what I thought was a handkerchief, and pass it to Barnes—I followed them to St. Paul's-churchyard—I there saw Nions take another handkerchief, and give it to Barnes—I told the officer; but previous to that they had stopped and spoken to a female with a brown cloak on—I have not been able to find the person from whom they took the first handkerchief—I had no officer with me.

Nions. I asked you what colour the handkerchief was; and you could not tell. Witness. I could not see—there was a handkerchief found on Barnes, but I do not know anything about it—I did not call an officer at first, because I saw you follow another gentleman.





OLIVER DEATH
 (City police-constable No. 201.) I took the prisoners, and found this handkerchief in Barnes's left-hand trowsers' pocket—he was asked if it was marked—he said no—when we came to examine it, it was marked "H."

Barnes's Defence. I gave 3s. 6d. for the handkerchief to a man who walked about the street with a great many on his arm.





ARTHUR THOMAS KILLBY
 (City police-constable, No. 202.) I produce a certificate of Nion's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—-the pri
soner is the person.

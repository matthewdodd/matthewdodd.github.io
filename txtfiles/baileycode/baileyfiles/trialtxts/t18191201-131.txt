            . I am bar-maid
 to Mr. Bunyer. On the 31st of October, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, my shawl was taken from my room - the prisoner slept in the house that night; she had been brought in by the Overseers of the parish. About nine o'clock I missed it - she was gone out. The hostler went out and brought her back in about twenty minutes with the shawl in her bundle. She had no business in my room.

            . I keep the Bull and Butcher Inn. The prisoner was brought in by the Overseers in a dying state. My servant missed a shawl. I sent the hostler after her. She declared she had nothing - the servant found the shawl on her.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

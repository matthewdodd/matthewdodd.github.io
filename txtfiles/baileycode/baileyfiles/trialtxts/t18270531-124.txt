             was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 7th of April
, 1 fixture, (i.e.) 1 copper, value 10s., the goods of 
                     
                        Jane 
                        Jones
                     




                  , widow
, and fixed to her dwelling-house
            .
JANE JONES. I am a widow, and live in Nelson-street, St. Matthew, Bethnal-green


. This copper was fixed in the wash-house, which is in my yard - it is part of my premises - it does not join the house; the yard is mine, and the wash-house is part of the house; it was safe at six o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of April, and next morning, at six, I missed it.

GEORGE MORRIS. I am a watchman. On the 7th of April, at a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and saw the prisoner coming down Nelson-street, with the copper on his head; I took hold of him, and asked what he was going to do with it - he threw it down, and got from me; I took him - he got from me again; I called Watch! and he was secured; I compared the copper with Mrs. Jones' wash-house - it fits exactly in every part.

                  SMITH
               



            . I received the prisoner at the watch-house. I matched the copper with the brick work - it fitted every part exactly.
Prisoner's Defence. I tried to get from him because he almost choked me; he said he would choke me to death.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 19.

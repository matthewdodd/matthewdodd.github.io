                           Edward 
                           Willis
                        




                     
                  , privately in his shop

                  SUSANNAH 
                  FEAST
               



            . I live in Bull's Head-court, King-street, Peter-street. On the 1st of this month I was near Mr. Willis's shop upon Clerkenwell-green


, I saw 
               
                  Edward 
                  Taylor
               



             and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Smith
               



             at Mr. Willis's shop door; 
               
                  Ann 
                  Smith
               



             went into Mr. Willis's shop; I saw her take something out of the window; she gave it to Taylor; he put it under his coat; he ran up the green. I saw no further of that. She then went into the shop again; she took something out of the window, put it into her apron, and then run up the green. I then went and gave information to Mr. Willis; he was in the back parlour. He pursued 
               
                  Ann 
                  Smith
               



            . I saw her brought back with the property in her apron. That is all I know.


                  EDWARD 
                  WILLIS
               



            . I keep a clothes-shop
 upon Clerkenwell-green. On the 1st of September, in consequence of what the little girl told me, I pursued the prisoner, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Smith
               



            . I overtook her, and brought her back with the four waistcoats in her apron. I did not see the men prisoners until afterwards. These are the waistcoats; they are my property.

            . Limbrick and I took the woman in custody about five o'clock. After Smith had been before the magistrate Taylor and Turner, at eight o'clock, followed her; as we were conveying her to New prison they asked us to let her have something to drink at the Jolly Cooper. They drank together, and talked together. Limbrick told me these men answered the description that he had of them; he took them in custody.

. On the 26th of October, I heard a woman had taken something; I went into the street, and saw the prisoner running fast - I followed her, and near Sadler's-wells I took her, and taxed her with stealing the linen; she denied it, but I turned up her cloak and found it - it had been in the lobby of the shop.

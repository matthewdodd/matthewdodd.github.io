Elizabeth Lee. The clover seed was in my cart. I know nothing of the robbery. My man came home and told me of it.

            . I am carman to Mrs. Lee. On the 21st of January I had twenty sacks of clover seed in my cart. As I was going along, four or five fellows came behind the cart and cut one of the sacks; I happened to go behind the cart and saw them; the prisoner had his apron full. I laid hold of two of them, and one of the others came up and knocked me down. I secured the prisoner, and he dropped the seed. I picked it up and delivered it to the constable; there were eleven pounds of it; there was a hundred and a quarter weight taken out.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw the cart going along, and the seed running out; I put my apron at the tail of the cart in order to preserve it for the carman.

SARAH ELIZABETH BOTTLEY. I live in Swan-place, Plummer-street, City-road


 - I see gentlemen. On the 27th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, I was standing at my door; the prisoner came by - he was a perfect stranger; he addressed me first, and asked if he might be allowed to walk in - I said he might if he liked, but I had an old lady, her daughter, and son there; he said he did not mind, we would have something to drink altogether, and he would send for something - he came in, and sent my servant with 1s. 6d. for some brandy and gin, which was brought; he and the old lady drank the brandy, and we drank the gin - while my servant was gone he said he would give me four half-crowns to be with me that night, which I accepted; he gave me the four half-crowns, and I put them into my purse - he then sent another 1s. 6d. for more brandy and gin, and he gave 1s. for some cheese; my purse had 2s. 6 1/2d. in it before I put the four half-crowns in - the halfpenny had five holes in it; I had some loose silver and copper in my pocket, but could not say how much - we went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock; I took off my pocket, which had the purse in it, wrapped it in my stays, and put them on the drawers - I was awoke about three or four o'clock by my servant, who said she did not think all was right; I then saw the prisoner dressed, and standing near the drawers - he had been undressed when he went to bed; he heard my servant say she did not think all was right, as she had heard him about the room for half an hour - she said I had better get up and see that all was right; I got up, looked into my pocket, and said I had not got a farthing - I accused him of having my money; he said, "No, I have not;" my servant went for an officer by my desire - he was searched in my presence, and my purse was taken from him - he had denied having it, and said most likely my servant had it; when the Policeman came he again denied having it, but it was found inside the lining of his trousers, near the calf of his leg - the Policeman also found about him two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d.; I can swear to the purse, and the halfpenny with five holes was in it.
Prisoner. Q.Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes, with the exception of the share of the liquor I had at your expence, which was very little - some of the gin was left in the bottle; I had my perfect recollection - there were six chairs in my sitting-room.
SARAH ADAMS. I am servant to the prosecutrix - when I first lived with her she was under the care of a gentleman who has gone to sea. On the night stated I was sent out by the prisoner, who was with my mistress, for brandy and gin; I had never seen him there before - he and the elderly lady drank the brandy; her daughter, son, my mistress, and I drank the gin - the prisoner took none of that; I went out a second time for 1s. 6d. worth more liquor, which was disposed of in the same way - I then fetched - lb. of cheese, for which the prisoner gave me 1s. and I paid 7 1/2d. for it; the prisoner went to bed with my mistress - he awoke me by walking about the room, but I cannot say the time; I slept in the adjoining room - I called, and asked if he wanted to go out; he said No - I laid down again; I heard him rustling about again forabout half an hour - I again asked if he wanted to go out; he said Yes - I said, "I will get you a light;" I got on my gown and shawl, and said,"I will let you down," but I first awoke my mistress, and asked if all was right - I then went down for a light; when I came up my mistress was standing with her pocket in her hand, empty, and she said, "Adams, I have not a farthing in the world;" I said, "Perhaps you have put your money somewhere;" she said, "No, I am certain I put it into my pocket, and rolled the pocket up in my stays;" I looked about every where I thought it could be - she then accused the prisoner, and said, "You must have my purse and money;" she said, "Give me the purse, and I will forgive you all, for my friend gave it me, and I would not lose it for the world;" he denied it, and said he had not got it, she might search him, and she did put her hand inside his pockets-I said to him, "You must have it;" he said, "It is more likely you have got it a great deal;" my mistress then cried, and said, "Do give it me, there is a good man;" he still denied having it - she then said, "I will not lose my purse," and she desired me to get an officer; when the officer came the prisoner still denied it, but the officer found the purse within the lining of his trousers, near the calf of his leg - he had denied over and over again having the purse or money.
Prisoner. Q. Can you tell the number of persons who were sitting in the room? A. Yes, there were five besides myself - I did not state at Worship-street that there were seven; I did not say, "Have you fleeced him?" she is not a person of that character.
JAMES CLAY. I am a Police-constable. I was called to that house between three and four o'clock on the Sunday morning; I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in the bed-room - he was dressed; the servant had come for me; the prosecutrix was partly dressed - she accused the prisoner of stealing a purse, containing 12s. 6 1/2d.; he denied any knowledge of it till I found it in the lining of his trousers, just below the knee - this is the purse; there is 12s. 6 1/2d. in it - the halfpenny has five holes in it.
Prisoner. Q. Did I deny having any money in my pocket independent of that purse? A. No - I found on you two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d.; it was taken from you at the station, but the inspector returned it to you next morning.
S.E. BOTTLEY. This is my purse, and the money in it; here is the halfpenny with five holes in it.
Prisoner. You will find in the deposition that she stated she had four shillings loose in her pocket, and there were not four shillings found - her servant said to her,"Mrs. Jones, is all right, have you fleeced him?" the truth is, she was in such a disgusting state of intoxication that I got up, and said I would not stay with her - when she got to the watch-house, and found I had more money about me, she wanted to make a further charge; I am a clerk in the City.
JAMES CLAY. The prosecutrix was perfectly sober.

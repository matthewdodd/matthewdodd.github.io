PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A gentleman asked me to carry them, he had a sack on his head.
The Prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.



               GUILTY
            .
Court to Prisoner. This is a second instance that has occurred this Sessions, of dustmen robbing houses; it is an offence particularly dangerous, because the credulity of servants is imposed upon by those that come under that pretence, they come into the house under a trust; I think it therefore necessary, for example, to pronounce sentence upon you before you quit the bar, in the hearing of those who have heard the trial, and that sentence shall be as severe as the law admits in such a case; which is, that you be 


               Transported for seven years
            .

GEORGE PRENTICE WARD. I am a journeyman baker
. Last Saturday evening I was going down Gray's Inn-lane


 with a basket of bread - I met the prisoner, who made a snatch at my watch - the chain broke off, I put down my basket and caught her with it in her hand; I kept her till the officer came and took her - I had never seen her before.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner from the prosecutor - she had this chain and seal in her hand; the baker's basket stood close by him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I did not touch it.

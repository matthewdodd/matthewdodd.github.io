HENRY BRABY
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 stick, value 1d., the goods of 



John Hoffman; and 1 copper, value 13s., the goods of

SAMUEL FREWING
. I live in Winchester-street, Clerkenwell—I am a bricklayer—about eight o'clock in the morning of the 2nd March I missed a copper from a wash-house by the side of my cottage—I had seen it safe the night before—I have since seen the copper, and was present when it was fitted to the place where it was taken from—it is a wash-house for three of the cottages—it is the property of Robert Mills—there was a stick lost from the wash-house, which was the property of the next door neighbour, John Hoffman.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How do you know the copper belonged to Robert Mills? A. I purchased it for him of Mr. Pontifex, and fixed it for Mr. Mills the same day.





ALEXANDER BUTTERS
 (police-constable N 280.) I stopped the prisoner in Wharf-road with this copper and stick in his posession—I saw him coming along the dark side of some houses—I collared him, and asked where he was going with the copper—he said he had found it, and was going to take it to the station-house—I told him he was going a contrary way—I took this stick from him, which is the washing stick—he threw the copper down at my feet—I took him, sprung my rattle, and got a person to take the copper to the station—I found on the prisoner a box of lucifer matches, and a pair of old scissors—this is the copper—I saw it fitted in the place—it fitted exactly.





THOMAS WITHERS
 (police-constable N 211.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 3rd April, 1843, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.

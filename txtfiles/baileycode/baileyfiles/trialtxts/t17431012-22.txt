            . On the 6th of September, between ten and twelve in the Day-Time, the Prisoner came with his Boat under the Stern of the Winchelsea Privateer, commanded by Capt. 
               
                  John 
                  Gerald 
               



            ; I am Lieutenant of her; and I saw the Rope put out of the Ship into his Boat; and he took it into his Boat, and covered it with a Cloak, there were only his Wife and him in the Boat; I took it out of his Boat afterwards - it belongs to the Owners of the Ship; I said to him, Friend, you have some Rope belonging to the ship; he delivered it very readily, but desired not to be carried before a Justice.
Prisoner. The Rope was tossed into my Boat; I knew nothing at all of it; I said, Gentlemen, here's some Rope tossed into my Boat, pray come and take it out.
Capt. 
               
                  John

             proved, that the Gentlemen mentioned in the Indictment were the sole Owners of the Ship.
Prisoner. When I called to the Gentlemen to come, and take away the Rope, which was thrown into my Boat; they jumped into my Boat, and said, Aye Damn you, so we will, and we will bring you to Justice.

            . I am an Officer in the Ship; I was told, that there was a Bum-Boat under the Stern; I saw the Prisoner place himself in a Posture, as if he was to receive something; and the Rope was thrown out of the Ship to him; said I, You Rascal, I see you; I was surprized at the Thing, because there were fifty People there, at the same Time; and the King's Officers werethere; the Prisoner whipt it outof his own B at, and threw it into the King's Boat; and I took it out of the King's Boat, and put it again into his Boat, and carried him to Capt. Gerald; the Prisoner said, he would have me whip him, or jerk him, or something of that kind, and let him go; but, I said, I would not consent to any thing, till I brought him to Capt. Gerald.
Jury. I desire to know whether you ever found out who were his Confederates on board the Privateer?
Lewis. I cannot tell who were his Accomplices, there were forty or fifty Men on Board.
Jury. I would ask you whether, when you called to him, that he seemed make off, or not?
Lewis. Yes, he moved the Boat off - he did not at that Time say, that it was thrown into his Boat. 

               Guilty

            . I am assistant to my brother William, a linen-draper
, of St. Botolph, Aldgate


. On the 12th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, to look at some prints, and another woman to look at a shawl; my fellow shopman attended to them; some other persons came in for muslin, to whom I attended; the prisoner left the shop - I thought some things were missing, and that they were all concerned - I went out, and took the prisoner, about five or six yards off, and brought her back; she asked what she had done - I said I thought she had got a piece of print; she made no reply, but these two pieces of print fell from her; the other three persons were in the shop, but not near enough to drop them.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not find them on the floor? A. I saw them drop from her- I took them all before the Magistrate, supposing they were all concerned; the other women were not within a yard of her.

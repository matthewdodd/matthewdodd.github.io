            . I live at Hammersmith. I put up my cart and horse in my coach-house at Hammersmith


; I was informed the next morning between seven and eight o'clock, that the place was broke open; I went and found the cart broke open, and there were missing the goods mentioned in the indictment.
John Horton. I am a watchman, at Hammersmith; I saw Hurst pass by loaded with linen; he was about 200 yards from Wood's house; I followed him, and saw Liver and him at the Thames, endeavouring to launch a boat; I bid Liver touch the boat at his peril, upon which Hurst ran away: then I took the linen out of the boat. Liver said Hurst hailed him in to take a load of goods; he is a waterman; he said if I had told him they were stolen goods, he would have helped to secure him; I asked him for the number of his boat, which he gave me; I took the goods to the watch-house; Hurst was taken the same day.
Hurst called four and Liver three witnesses, who gave them good characters.
HURST, 

               guilty

               acquitted

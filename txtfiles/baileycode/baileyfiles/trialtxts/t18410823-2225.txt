GEORGE HOLLAND
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of August, 2 gowns, value 7s.; 1 shirt, value 1s.; 1 pair of stockings, value 3d.; and 1 handkerchief, value 3d.; the goods of 



Ann Woodman; and that he had been before convicted of felony.


ANN WOODMAN. I lodge at Mrs. Hurst's. I found the prisoner in my room about four o'clock in the day, on the 19th of August—he was partly undressed—he had a pair of my stockings on his legs, and my handkerchief in his pocket—Mrs. Hurst had found these gowns and shirt before she called me—they are my property—the prisoner had no business in my room.





MARIA HURST
. I live in Went worth-street The prisoner came to lodge in my house on the night of the 18th of August—I called him at nine o'clock the next morning—he got up, came down, and appeared very, ill and very sick—I said, "You don't seem well, would a bason of tea be of any use to you?"—he said, "Yes, and thank you too"—I said, "You had better go and lie down again"—he went up, and laid till four—I then went to him to know if he would get up—he said, "Yes"—I went up again in about ten minutes, and could not see him in his room—I looked in another room, he was not there—I then looked in the further room, and he was standing by Mrs. Woodman's bed-side—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "I don't know"—I found this gown in his hat—I said, "You are robbing the woman"—I locked the door, ran down, and called Mrs. Woodman up—when I went up again he was half undressed—he was dressed when I first saw him, and I suppose he had these things on him, as there was nothing on the bed when I went down, and when I came up again some of these things were on the bed, and the rest on him.






PIERCE DRISCOLL
 (police-constable H 24.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

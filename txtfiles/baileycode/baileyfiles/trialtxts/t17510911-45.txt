            . I am a victualler
, and live at the Hole in the Wall, Baldwin's Gardens, near Gray's Inn Lane


. On the 31st of August, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, I lost the two plates, when the prisoner was in my house. I saw him go into the kitchen, but I did not see him come out again, being just going out with a pot of beer. This was about three minutes before they were missing. Presently after Mr. Parrot brought the plates and the prisoner back; who confessed selling a saucepan, which we lost some time before, for eight pence.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 31st of August, about six in the evening, the prisoner brought these two plates (producing them) to my shop, and said he wanted a shilling upon them. I asked him whose they were, he said his own; but I seeing Mr. Gladen's name wrote at length on the bottom, said, Don't you know one Mr. Gladen? he said yes; so I carried them to Mr. Gladen's, and the prisoner followed me. He was then secured, and owned the stealing of a sauce-pan, which Mr. Gladen had lost, and sold it, and said he was very sorry for what he had done.

Prisoner's Defence.
I was in liquor, and how I came by the things, I do not know. He called no witnesses.




               Guilty, 10 d.

            . The prisoner was our porter


. On the 29th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I told the prisoner I suspected he had robbed me; I insisted upon searching him. I found three pounds of blue verditer in his hat.

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Brandram and Company. In a morning, I generally go over the warehouse to look at it. I had smoothed the cask of verditer; I observed the print of a man's fingers in it. I could see that some man's hand had been in it, and seeing the prisoner's coat all over with it I informed Mr. Brandram of it.

Moss. That is like our verditer; it is worth half-a-guinea; there is three pounds of it.

            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in East-Smithfield. Last Easter Sunday, at night, I was a little in liquor, and I went to see an acquaintance in Penitent-street, at the sign of the Cannon. I staid a little latish, and went away about eleven o'clock. Going along the street, I met two young women. I was smoaking a pipe, and one of them asked me to give her a pipe. The prisoner was one of them.
Q. Where was this?
Ryder. This was in Ratcliff-highway. They asked me where I was going? I said, I was locked out of my lodging, and being a stranger in this country, did not know where to get a lodging. The prisoner said I should go along with her. When I came into her house, I paid her eighteen pence for my lodging. It was in some court. I went to-bed, but before I went to bed I sent for sixpennyworth of brandy, as she desired something to drink. The other girl went and brought the liquor in and went away. After that, the prisoner sent for a pot of beer. Then she came to bed to me. She blowed the candle out, and after she had been in bed about ten minutes, she got out of bed, saying, she must go and lock the door, for fear of thieves. She took all my things out of my pockets, and did not come back again.
Q. Was you on a ground floor, or up stairs?

Ryder. It was in a room up one pair of stairs; she left one of her stockings behind her. After that, she sent a woman to get me out of the house. The woman came swearing at me, and asked me what business I had there. She asked me if I had lost any thing. I did not know then that I had. I went to look after my things, and found my watch, money, and things were gone.
Q. How much money?
Ryder. About 7 s. My watch was a silver one, and I lost a paper tobacco-box, and a leather pocket-book. When I came to look about for my things, I found one of her stockings. I asked the woman after the prisoner; she said she knew nothing of her. She swore so at me, I went out of the house, and went up to Whitechapel, got an officer from the watch-house, and went to search the house, but the woman would not let us in. We observed the window to be open, and the key of the door hanging in the window. The watchman took it and opened the door. We went in, and up stairs, and found the prisoner lying in the bed where she and I had laid before, and another young man and woman in the same room. The officer took them all to the watch-house. We found nothing on the bed then but my pocket-book. (Produced and deposed to.)
Q. Had you searched well before you went out of the room?
Ryder. I had searched the bed all over, and under it; they were taken before the bench of Justices, and were all three committed. The other two are got clear, but I do not know how they got clear.
Q. Were any body else in the room before you lost your things, besides the prisoner?
Ryder. The prisoner is the only person that was in the room at the time. I am sure I had my watch, money, and pocket-book, after the other girl went out of the room and brought up the liquor.


                  James 
                  Thorburn 
               



            . The prosecutor came to the watch-house between twelve and one o'clock in the night, and said he had lost his watch, a pocket-book, a tobacco-box, and about 7 s. in silver.
Q. Was he sober or fuddled?
Thorburn. He was sober, to the best of my judgment. I asked him whereabouts he lost them; he told us. The watch-house was very full of prisoners, so I could not go. I sent some of the watchmen, and soon after I went down myself, but I could not get in. I called to the girl, and said, Who have you got in the room? She swore there was no body in the house but herself. I heard a girl call down not to open the door; after that we opened the shutter, and found the key hanging on the inside. We took it, and opened the door, and found the girl which the prosecutor said was the person that took his things. We searched the room, but found nothing except the pocket-book. We took them all before the Justices, except one man, who got away.

                  Summerfield 
               



            . I am a watchman. I was with the prosecutor and Mr. Thorburn. I can say no more than what they have.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went down Ratcliff-highway, to one Mrs. Williams's. Coming out of the door, this man had a pipe in his mouth, and the other girl asked him to give her the pipe. He gave it her directly. She asked him where he was going; he said by the May-pole, but could not get in. She said if he would go along with her, she would help him to a night's lodging. He went with her. I said, the house was none of mine. It belongs to Mrs. Talbot. He sent for a pint of beer, and said he had no more money. She offered him the farthing, and he would not take it. I left them and went to the King of Prussia, at Saltpetre-Bank, and when I came back again, they had turned the man out of the house. I have no friends in London, my friends live a great many miles off. There were four beds in that room, and people in them.
Q. to Prosecutor. Were there other beds in the room besides that you was in?
Prosecutor. There were, but no soul in them.

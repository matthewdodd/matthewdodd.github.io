            . On the 26th of Sept. coming along the Fleet market


 about 7 o'clock at night, there were two boys fighting, and a crowd about them; I went to see, and felt a shoving going to get away; I put my hand to my pocket, and miss'd my handkerchief, I saw the prisoner with it in his hand. I went and collar'd him, he threw it between two baskets; I kept fast hold of him, and took it up; he made a noise, and several people came up to rescue him from me; I said, will no body help me? then two butchers came to my assistance; I had receiv'd several blows from some of them. These butchers said, the prisoner was a common thief, and they would help me to a constable; he went to the compter that night, and he next day I took him before Sir

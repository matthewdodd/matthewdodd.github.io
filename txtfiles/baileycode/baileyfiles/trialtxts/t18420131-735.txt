THOMAS PICKERING
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of January, 1 purse, value 2d.; 1 crown, and 6 shillings; the property of 



Joseph Linscott; from the person of 



Elizabeth Linscott







ELIZABETH LINSCOTT
. I am the wife of Joseph Linscott, living in St. John-street. On the 6th of January I went to the chemist to buy some powders—I took my purse out, and took 6d. out to pay for them—I put the purse into my pocket again—the prisoner and Daniel Mahoney came in—I felt the prisoner against me, and on turning my face towards him, I saw him draw my purse from my pocket—I caught hold of his left hand, which had my purse in it—I exclaimed, "Oh my G—, he has got my purse!"—I saw it in his hand—it contained 11s.

Prisoner. I asked what you wanted with me, and stood still. Witness. No, you did not.





WILLIAM HUNTER
. I live at Wapping. I was in the chemist's shop—I saw the prisoner and Mahoney come into the shop—I saw Mrs. Linscott take hold of the prisoner's hand which had the purse in it—there were two

or three on the outside, who forced the door in, as the prisoner made resistance to get out, and there might have been time for him to give the purse to the others.





WILLIAM ATTERSLEY
. I saw the prisoner and Daniel Mahoney come into the shop—I saw the prisoner wrench his hand from the lady when she seized him, and endeavour to make his escape—the door was thrown open, and there were others there—the prisoner had time to give them the purse—he had no money on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I went in for a halfpenny-worth of stick liquorice; three boys shoved me against the woman; she seized me, and said, "You have got my purse;" I said, "You are welcome to search me." I took my jacket off, and some of them went for a policeman. I am innocent. I had been at work for Mr. Byers.

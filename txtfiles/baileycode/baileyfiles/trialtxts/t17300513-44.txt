The Prosecutor depos'd, That having been in Bishopsgate-street, going along Hounsditch


, he stopp'd to make Water, and that he did not perceive her, till he felt her Hand in his Pocket; that he immediately clapt hold of her, and demanded his Money again, but she put it into her Bosom, that a Man and Woman came up immediately to them, and said to her, if you have his Money give it him, and he got 14 s. of it, and carried her to the Watch-house.
The Prisoner pleaded, That she sitting on a Bulk, the Prosecutor came to her, had a Rod in his Hand, and offer'd her two Shillings, or half a Crown to lie with her, but she refusing, he whipt her, and would have had her gone to the Rails on Tower-Hill with him; but this Plea did not avail, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

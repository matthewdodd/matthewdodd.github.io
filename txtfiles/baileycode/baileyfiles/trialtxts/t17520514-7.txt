Mary Anderson. The prosecutrix, my daughter, is ill and cannot attend ; I live with her at the bottom of Mount Pleasant


, the goods mentioned in the indictment were in our room; on the 20th of April my daughter was gone out with milk: I gave the prisoner lodging and got her work, she was in the room by herself, when I came home about six o'clock she and the things were missing. I met her last Monday coming out of her uncle's shop in Fleet street, with the petticoat on, and took her up, she owned she pawned the shift in Aldersgate street for 3 s. 6 d. and another not made up for 2 s 6 d. she has owned every thing: she has got the petticoat on now.
Prisoner's Defence.
She lent me the petticoat, I am of no business, my uncle allows me 3 s. 6 d. per week.
Q. Does he know you are in prison and are to take your trial here?
Prisoner. He does, but is not here, nor I don't expect him.




               Guilty 10 d.

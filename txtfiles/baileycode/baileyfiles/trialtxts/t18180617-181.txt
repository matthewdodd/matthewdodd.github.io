            . I am a brush-maker, and live opposite the house, No. - 4, Duke-street, Adelphi. On the 14th of June I got up about eight o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner M'Adams, in the two-pairs front room. I got the key, unlocked the padlock, and found the inside door fastened. I found the three prisoners in the two-pair back room. I sent for an officer, and gave them in charge. I found about 25lbs. of lead cut from the gutters; the sink had been cut away, and put up ready to be taken off - They said they came there for a night's lodging.
Cross-examined. Two of them had large knives.

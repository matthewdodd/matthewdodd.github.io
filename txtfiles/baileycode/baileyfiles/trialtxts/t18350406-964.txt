JOHN SAUNDERS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of March, at 
Wilsden, 1 mare, price 10l.; 1 collar, value 2s. 6d.; and 1 bridle, value 1s. 6d.; the goods and property of 



John Brown.






JOHN BROWN
. I am a contractor for public works. I am engaged at Harlesdon-green, on the rail-road. I had a mare there which I saw safe between seven and eight o'clock on Wednesday, the 18th of March—the

work was then over, and she was put into the stable—I saw her in the stable—I got up about half-past four o'clock next morning, and the mare was gone—in consequence of information, I went towards Uxbridge, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, which is ten or twelve miles—I found the mare just as I got on the other side of Uxbridge—the prisoner was leading her—I took him into custody—I know him—he was employed on the rail-road—I asked what he meant by taking my mare away—he made no answer, but persisted in keeping hold of her—she had on a bridle and collar, which were mine, and a halter—I am confident it is my mare—she is worth 10l.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking all day, and was come out of a public-house at twelve o'clock at night—I met a gentleman on the road, who gave me 3s. to take the mare to High Wycombe—when Brown overtook me, he knocked me down, made me all over blood; and gave me two black eyes.





JOHN BROWN

re-examined. I was obliged to use violent means to get the mare from him—he was in liquor.





JOHN BIRCH
. I am a constable. Harlesden-green is about twelve miles from Uxbridge.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Justice Gaselee.

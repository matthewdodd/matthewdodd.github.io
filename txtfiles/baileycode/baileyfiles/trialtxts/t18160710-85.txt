GEORGE HARRIS. I am a cheese-monger
, at 107, Shoreditch. On the day in the indictment, I sent two cheeses to a gentleman in Hackney-road, by a person named 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waddington
               



            ; she had not been gone long before she returned with only one cheese.

                  WADDINGTON
               



            . I am thirteen years of age. On my way with these cheeses, I set the basket down to rest, and I requested the prisoner to help it up on my shoulder again, which he did; but in doing so, he took one of the cheeses out, and ran off; but a gentleman went after him, and brought him back.

            . I stopped the prisoner with the cheese.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

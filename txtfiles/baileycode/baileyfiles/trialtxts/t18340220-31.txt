             (police-constable C 99). On the 13th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Leicester-square; I saw the three prisoners, and watched them for two hours, or more; they had then got to Titchfield-street


; King there took a flat basket from Mr. Thurgoods's window, and put it on Keen's head; he walked off; I went after him, and took him with him; Darman had a white apron on, which he took off and gave to Keen before the basket was taken.

             (police-constable C 85). I was with Stone; I saw Darman take off his cap and put it on Keen's head, and the white apronr round him, to make him look like a butter-man.

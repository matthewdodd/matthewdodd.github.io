36. 




JOHN CANNING
 was indicted

 for embezzling £1 from 



George Colk, his master.—2nd COUNT. For stealing the same.






GEORGE COLK
. The prisoner lived with me as servant—I sent him on the 24th of October to get change for a sovereign—he never returned with

that or the change—his father brought him back the following morning, and returned part of the change to me then—he was to get the change where he liked—I merely desired him to get change—his father lives in the Temple, near me.





WILLIAM CANNING
. I am the prisoner's father. He came to me and asked me to get change—I gave him 20s. Wrapped up in a piece of paper, put it into his side pocket, and told him to be careful and take it to his master, like a good boy—he came home at twelve o'clock at night, and brought with him 6s. 6 1/2 d.—I took him to his master next morning.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

THOMAS BARNARD FRENCH
. I live in Eden-grove, Holloway. On the 7th of June I was on Blackfriars-bridge at half-past eleven o'clock—I received information, and turned and saw the witness Edwards struggling with the prisoner, and my handkerchief was under her feet—this is it—(looking at one)—it was in my pocket a little while before.





ALFRED RENTON EDWARDS
. I live in Vauxhall-bridge-road. I was Blackfriars-bridge on this occasion, and saw the prisoner abstract this handkerchief, or one of this pattern, from the prosecutor's pocket—I took and told the prosecutor—I was struggling with her, and swung her round, and this handkerchief was under her feet.

Prisoner. There were several persons before me. Witness. Yes, there were several persons in a bunch—I turned sideways to let them pass, and law her take the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. He did opt see me—I never; had it in my possession.





BENJAMIN CATMUL
. I am a police-officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person, and had six months imprisonment.

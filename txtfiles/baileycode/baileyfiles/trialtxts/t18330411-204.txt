             was in my employ as servant

, till the 23rd of December; the male prisoner called on her at different times; I had seen him there three times. On the night of the 22nd of December I took up a rose-wood box, and placed it on a chest of drawers, in my bed-room; it contained about 36l. in gold and silver, two watches, three gold seals, four pairs of earrings, a coral necklace, and two silver snuff-boxes - I am certain there were ten rings in it; there were crowns, half-crowns, and shillings in it - about nine o'clock the next morning I went down, leaving the box safe;

             was then in my kitchen - I went up to my bed-room in about a quarter of an hour, and the box was gone.

            . I am an officer of the Liberty of Ripon, in the West-riding of Yorkshire. I apprehended the female prisoner at Beckworth Shaw, in the parish of Pannell, on the 18th of February - I found on her this satin purse; and the next morning I took the man at Rowcliff, in the parish of Aldborough - I found on him a metal watch, two rings, a coral drop, and some other articles.

            . Q. Upon your oath, who was the person you received these things from? A. You was in the act of putting them out of the prison-window, and telling some children to destroy them: I took them up, and asked him if they were the things his wife gave to him - I showed them to him, he said they were what his wife gave him, he had not stolen them.
Elizabeth Haydon. This is my purse, this necklace, and these three gold rings; this watch and three seals, and other articles are mine - they were all in the box, and locked up.

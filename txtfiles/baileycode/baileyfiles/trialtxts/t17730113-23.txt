            . I am apprentice to a paper stainer
. On the 9th of January, about eight in the evening, as I was passing through Bishopsgate-street


, Smithers snatched my hat from my head; she ran away; I followed her, and cried, stop thief! she ran down Wide-gate-alley; she slipped into a house; I followed her; I saw the hat lie down by the bed; she called down Bracket; they demanded five shillings of me; I had no money, and they said they would cleave my skull if I dare take my hat.
Q. Did any thing familiar pass between you?
Yeates. No, nothing like it.
Q. Do you think the hat was taken in fun in order to decoy you into this place?
Yeates. I think not; it might be in order to decoy me into the house to rob me.

            . I am the boy's master; I went with him to take the prisoners up; he told the same story then that he does now.
Q. How has he behaved?
Hudgson. With a great deal of order and propriety.

ELLEN RIAN



, stealing 1 ring, value 10s.; the goods of 



Joseph Notley; having been before convicted.






GEORGE LOADER
 I am shopman to Mr. Notley. On 25th Feb., the prisoner came and asked to see a wedding-ring—I showed her some—I went

to the other end of the shop, came back, and asked if any suited her—she said, "No"—I missed one from the card, and told my master—there was another customer about three yards from her.

Cross-examined by
MR. MELLER.
Q. The rings were on two cards? Yes; there were six on one, and five on the other, when I took them from the window—none of those on the card with five fitted, and I put it in the window again.





JOSEPH NOTLEY
 I received information, and accused the prisoner—I took her into the parlour, put my finger into her mouth, and felt something like a ring—I thought she swallowed it.

Cross-examined. Q. Did she resist? A. No; I put my finger in too suddenly—this is the ring (produced)—it is marked with two letters and four figures, and has a motto as well—it is the only one of the kind I had.





CAROLINE SHEAD.
 I took some coffee into the prisoner's cell—she asked me to take a cap to her friends outside—I found this ring in it.

Cross-examined. Q. There were other women in the cell? A. Yes.






ROBERT DICKER
(policeman, B 5.) I produce a certificate—(read—Elien Gorman, convicted May, 1846; having been before convicted; confined it months)—I was present at both trials—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

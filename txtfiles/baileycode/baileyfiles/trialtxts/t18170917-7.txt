            , who is an ironmonger
, and lives in Barbican, the prisoner was his porter
. On Sunday, the 24th of August, I received directions to watch the prisoner, and about eight o'clock in the morning I saw him go to the back of the shop, take down some parcels, and put them under his apron; I gave information to my master, he sent for a constable, who searched him, and found twelve till locks and ten padlocks and keys in his breeches, next to his skin; he said he had been carrying things out of the shop, in a small way, for months, and sold them to a man in Golden-lane.

            . I am a constable. I found the locks in the prisoner's breeches; he was asked if he had ever taken any before, and he said he had been in the habit of taking small things away.

ROBERT M'EWEN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



William Charles Thomas, from his person.






WILLIAM CHARLES THOMAS
. On the 12th of June I was in St. Martin's-court, a little after twelve o'clock in the daytime. I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round instantly, and saw the prisoner walking away from me—there was another person between him and me, but I was confident that the prisoner took it, and followed him—he turned into St. Martin's-lane, and ran 100 yards, I then saw him throw the handkerchief down—he was taken in about ten minutes.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far were you from him when he threw it down? A. Perhaps fifty yards—there was no one to obstruct my view—he was in the middle of the road—he continued to run after the handkerchief was thrown down.





JAMES REYNOLDS
. I am a messenger. I was in St. Martin's-court—the gentleman cried, "Stop thief"—1 instantly followed the prisoner, and continued following him—I was the nearest to him—I saw him throw away a handkerchief, which I picked up—I was not near him when he was taken.

Cross-examined. Q. The person was running at first, was he? No, walking, till the cry of "Stop thief"—I lost sight of him before he was taken—he ran up several courts, and got into a house of ill-fame, from there to another, and was taken in the dust-hole.





WILLIAM CARLE
 (police-constable F 77.) I took the prisoner—this is the handkerchief.
(William Bedford, a sawyer, of George-street, Battle-bridge, and Sarah Jefferson, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
 Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

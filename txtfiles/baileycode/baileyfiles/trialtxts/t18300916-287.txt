            . I am headborough of Hillingdon. On the 31st of July, I was in Mr. Benham's shop, and ironmonger, at Uxbridge


, and 
               
                  David 
                  Lane
               



             brought in this copper for sale - Mr. Benham refused to buy it, and said he had better take it to Mr. Grainge; instead of which he made the best of his way down Page's-lane - a gentleman told me I had better go after him; I went and saw the prisoner with it on his shoulder, and Lane with him - they ran off; the prisoner threw down the copper and ran through a river - I pursued the other, but lost him in a bean-field; this was about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - I fitted this copper to the place; it matches exactly; the prisoner is a native of Uxbridge.

                  Wyatt Grainge
               



             - it was in a house which the tenant had left; I did not see it fitted to the place - it had been safe on the 19th of July; the window was broken- I cannot say when it was taken.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw Lane, who asked me to carry it for him, which I did.

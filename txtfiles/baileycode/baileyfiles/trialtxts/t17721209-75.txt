- Seally. I went out of the compting-house into the back yard; while I was there, I saw the prisoner come into the compting-house and take a great coat off a chair. I stopt him with it as he was going out of the door. (The great coat produced and deposed to by 
               
                  John
                   Wickham

Prisoner's Defence.
I did not intend to take the great coat; I only had it in my hand; I went there to ask charity.

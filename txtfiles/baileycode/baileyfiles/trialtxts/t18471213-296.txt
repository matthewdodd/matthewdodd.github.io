JOHN BOOTH



, stealing 19lbs. of copper tubing, value 8s., the goods of 



Daniel Kitchen; having been before convicted.






DANIEL KITCHEN.
 I live in Crawford-street, Marylebone—this copper tubing is mine—I swear to it by the peculiarity of the pattern—it forms part of an illumination star—these parts fit the iron part which is left behind—it was in a warehouse, which was fastened with a padlock and hasp—the hasp was split, and the place forced open.





JOSEPH NIFTON
 (policeman, D 17.) At a quarter past eight o'clock, on the morning of 2nd December, I saw the prisoner and another man coming down the Edgware-road towards Hyde-park—I suppose he saw me—he crossed the road—he had a basket on his head—I afterwards took him—he had the basket on a truck then—I asked what he had got in the basket—he said he did not know—I searched the basket, and found this copper tubing in it.

Prisoner. It is false that he met me in the Edgware-road; he did not see me with it on my head; it is not my basket; I was employed to carry it.





GEORGE HIMBURY
 (police-sergeant, D 12.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted, Dec., 1846, and confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            .
Mr. COLIN ROSS. I have been a merchant
, and live in Sizelane. I was passing through St. Paul's Church-yard


 about half-past ten o'clock on the 15th of February, with a friend, when the prisoner made a sudden snatch at my watch chain - he broke the ring and took the chain and seals; I pursued and took him within about twelve yards, without losing sight of him; I took him into an apothecary's shop, and sent for an officer - the property was found upon him.

            . I am an officer. I found these two seals and chain on the prisoner - he handed them to me when I was about to search him.

LOUISA CHRISTIAN
. I am the wife of William Christian—we live at Bayswater. About a quarter before ten o'clock on the evening of the 26th of June, I had come from Gravesend by the steamer, and on coining up the steps of the wharf, I felt a tug at my gown—I did not know what it was—I thought it was one of my own children—when I got to the top of the stairs, the policeman touched me, and told me a man had picked my pocket—he took me to the station, and asked me to search my pocket—I had had a half-sovereign and some silver in my pocket, and I missed it.

Cross-examined by
MR. MELLOR. Q. This was at night? A. Yes-there was a great crowd—I could not see two yards—I do not exactly recollect what I had in my pocket—I had not had many tugs in passing along from the steamer—I was not hustled by the crowd—they did not press upon me.





WILLIAM HENRY WOLLEN
 (City police'Constable, No. 226.) I came from Gravesend as a passenger that night—I saw the prisoner touch Mrs. Christian outside her dress—that induced me to follow him—there is a flight of steps there, and I saw him lift Mrs. Christian's dress up, and put his hand into her pocket—I then took him, and found a half-sovereign, four shillings, two sixpences, and one halfpenny in his hand.

Cross-examined. Q. It was rather a dark night? A. It was getting towards dark—there was a great crowd—there is generally a struggle who

shall get first on shore—the lady walked first, then the prisoner, and then me—we were all walking close together—not two feet apart.

            , and 
               
                  
                     John 
                     Oliver 
                  



                
            , of St. Andrew Undershaft



, were indicted for 


               feloniously stealing 40 Pound of Unwrought Silk, value 40 s.
             the Goods of a Person unknown. It appeared by the Evidence, that Graham employ'd Oliver as a Labourer
 to dig in the Ruins of the late Fire in Billiter Lane


, that finding a Bale of Silk, they did conceal it, and offer'd it to Sale as their own Goods. Oliver pleaded he was employ'd by Graham, and that he ordered him to conceal the Silk, and he being a Country Fellow, but newly come to Town, he impos'd on his Ignorance so as to be concern'd in the concealing and selling it. Graham pleaded, that he and another Person had contracted with Mr. Foxly a Merchant, to give him a certain Sum of Mony for what Yarn of his they could dig out, that was not entirely burnt, but had been damag'd by the Fire, and that Oliver in digging, found a Bale of Silk, did carry it to his House unknown to him, and deny'd his being concerned in offering it to Sale. But this being plainly prov'd by the Evidences, the Jury found them both 

               guilty
             of Felony. 


               Transportation
            . But in Consideration of Oliver's Poverty and Ignorance, and so his being drawn into it by Graham, the Court commuted his Transportation into 



               Burning in the Hand
            .

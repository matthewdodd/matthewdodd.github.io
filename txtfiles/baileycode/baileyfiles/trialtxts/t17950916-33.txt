             sworn.
Q. You keep a public house
? - Yes, the George, in Grosvenor-square


, for eleven years. Mr. Sarson, at the Dover Castle had suspicion that he had stolen pots about the neighbourhood, and they watched him, and they found him with this bag, and a quart put in it; he immediately caught him by the collar, and told him that he thought he had got something in his bag that did not belong to him, and he took the bag from him, and found in it a quart pot belonging to me.
-SARSON sworn.
I know no further than I took the pot from the prisoner; I am a great loser by pots. (Produced and deposed to.)
Q. To Prosecutor. Had you lost any that day? - I had lost not less than a dozen a week for these three months; I told the prisoner that I thought he had something else in his pocket, and I took this new pint pot out of his pocket, it cost me fourteen-pence, the quart pot cost me fourteen-pence.
Prisoner. I was going along, and I picked them up in the high road, and I wished to see the owner of them, and it was my business to take them to the owner; I do assure you I should have had witnesses here to my character, had my trial been put off till to-morrow, but my friends are quite away from me at present.

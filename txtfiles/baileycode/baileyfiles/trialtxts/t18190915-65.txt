            . On Monday last I was going along Bishopsgate-street


 - Mr. Hunt's procession was coming, I was obliged to stop until the crowd passed. I found myself surrounded by a crowd, who were hustling me, and attempted to take my pocket-book. I had no sooner secured that than I felt my watch drawn from my fob. I felt the prisoner's hand pass between me and a lady who was with me, and immediately seized him, being convinced he was the person who took it, and collared him. As soon as I did that, he tried to pass my watch to another boy, and exclaimed,
"D - n me, George, why don't you take it?" The other boy, I believe, got hold of the seals, but the lady laid hold of it, and recovered it. I took him down a yard, and sent for a constable - I saw it in his hand. I never let him go.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I showed him the lad who had it - it was not me.

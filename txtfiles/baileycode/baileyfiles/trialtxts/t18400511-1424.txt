BENJAMIN BRITTEN
 (police-sergeant S 249.) I produce a certificate of the former conviction of George Tibby, which I obtained at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was not a witness on the trial, and was not present—it is a mistake on my part—the prisoner is not the person.

Q. How came you to apply for the certificate, if you were not at the trial, nor yet a witness? A. I thought at first sight he was the man, but after the second sight I find he is not—I was present at the trial of George Tibby, who was convicted of stealing a pair of shoes" but the prisoner is not that man.
(John Simmons, baker, North-street, Westminster, deposed to the prisoner's good character.)


NOT GUILTY of the previous conviction.

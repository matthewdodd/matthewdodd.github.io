I belong to his Majesty's Custom-house

, I lost my pocket handkerchief; I missed it, turned round, and discovered the prisoner endeavouring to hide it under his coat; he dropped it, and ran across the street, and another person followed him and took him.

             sworn.
I was going up Holborn; I heard the cry of, stop thief; saw the prisoner running, and caught him in my arms; Mr. Brown came up, and said, that was the man; that he had robbed him of his handkerchief.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was running with the other people; the gentleman laid hold of me, and said, I was the man.
The prisoner called one witness, who had known him twenty years, and gave him a very good character.

            .
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. ROSE.

JOHN BEAVENS. I keep livery stables
 in Bury-street, Bloomsbury


. The prisoner worked in my stable
. On the 14th of September, I had occasion to go to Mr. Aldridge's, in St. Martin's-lane. I went to my desk, and took out of my pocket 1 l. 9 s. 6 d. in silver, which I put into a bag in a little drawer in the desk. I locked it, and went out. I returned about four o'clock, and found a letter from Worcester. I went to put it into my desk, and found it broken open. I called my head ostler and the prisoner, and asked if they had been out - they said No. I then sent for a gentleman, who advised me to wait till the evening. The prisoner was the last man who went out that night, and I stopped him. I said "You are the man who robbed me a fortnight ago; for which I discharged a young man;" he then began crying. I said "Where your coat?" he took it down, and in the pocket of it I found the bag with the 1 l. 9 s. 6 d.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for. I had the man before, and put the question to him, whether he saw any person come into the stable - he said No - he had ridden a horse up and down, and had not seen any one. I told the prosecutor I should leave it till night, and quarter past eight o'clock, he brought the purse and money to me.

JOB CABLE. I let a ready furnished room to the prisoner about two months back; he occupied it six or seven weeks - he was behind in the rent. On the 28th of June my wife saw him go out with a large bundle; she had suspicion - we waited till half-past ten o'clock at night, when he and his wife came home; I then sent my wife up to inspect their room - she missed a counterpane and sheet - I spoke to an officer at the door, who took the prisoner, and found the duplicate.

Prisoner. I should have had some money in a short time, and should have replaced the things on Saturday night.

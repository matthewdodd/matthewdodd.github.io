It appeared that the Prosecutor (a Cheesmonger
 in King street Westminster


) laid the Bag with the Money, Notes, and Tobacco Box upon a Pile of Cheshire Cheeses, and opened the Shop Door and forgot to take the Bag up again. The Prisoner, who was his Porter
, came to open the Shop, and moved the Cheeses on which the Bag lay, to the Door. The Bag was mist, and the Prisoner denyed he had seen it. Notice was given to the Bank to stop such Notes. On the second of January the three Notes were sent back in a Penny Post Letter. The Money was found in a private Hole in the Prisoner's Lodging; upon which the Prisoner confest the Fact.
In his defence he said he found the Bag at the Door. 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

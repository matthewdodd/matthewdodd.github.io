JAMES MOORE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



William Thomas Doyle, from his person.






WILLIAM THOMAS DOTLE
. I am a Custom-house officer, and live in Water-street. About half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 16th of October I was going over Westminster-bridge—my attention was called by Walker, and I missed a silk handkerchief from my coat pocket, which was safe ten minutes before.





CHARLES WALKER
 (police-constable A 78.) I was on Westminster-bridge on the 16th of October, about half-past six o'clock, and saw the prisoner in company with another man—I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket—I took the two into custody—the prisoner got hold of my legs to get me on the ground—the other one made a severe struggle, and made his escape—I had seen him put it into his pocket—it was a dark handkerchief—he got away with—it at last.

Prisoner. He said he was driving over Westminster-bridge in a cab, and saw me take the handkerchief, and give it to another, up his smock-frock; now he says the other put it into hit pocket. Witness. The other had a smock-frock, which I tore down in his endeavouring to escape—I am confident the prisoner took it—I did not lose sight of him till I seized them—the prisoner got hold of my legs, to get me down, while the other pulled away from me.

MR. DOYLE
re-examined. Mine was a dark silk handkerchief; with a black or dark brown ground.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going over the bridge to my aunt's—I felt somebody come against my coat, which shoved me down.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

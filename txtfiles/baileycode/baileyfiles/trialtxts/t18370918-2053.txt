WILLIAM STEVENS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 22nd of August, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 




Joseph Holmes, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH HOLMES
. I assist in the counting-house of my uncle. On the 22nd of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street, and felt somebody at my pocket—I turned round, and caught the prisoner with my pocket-handkerchief in his hand—I laid hold of him, and he threw it on the other side of the flags, and ran away—I took it up and ran after him—he was stopped on the other side of the street, and I gave him in charge—I believe he is the same person—if he is the man I gave in charge he is the person—this is my handkerchief; it has my initials on it.





JOHN CORFIELD
. I am an officer. I took him in charge.





JOSEPH HAWKRIGG
 (City police-constable.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial, he is the man—I was a witness against him, having seen him pick a pocket—he was imprisoned for one year.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

MOSS ANSEL
. I am a clerk in the Accountant-General's office, in the Court of Bankruptcy. On Wednesday night, the 19th of Feb., I was at Mr. Cantor's, No. 6, Houndsditch, in a room adjoining the shop—it is parted from the shop by glass—I was looking through the glass, and saw the prisoner and another lad enter the shop—I watched for about a minute, and saw the prisoner take up a bale of sponge—he was ia the act of handing it to a boy, who was outside, when I ran out and collared him—the prisoner had the bale of sponge in his arms, and was stooping with it between the door and the passage—I knocked the sponge out of his arm with my knee, and put my foot upon it—I secured him, sent for a police-man, and gave him into custody.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Had he left the shop? A. No, he was in the act of leaving—he bad opened the glass-door and gone about three yards.





JOSEPH JACOB CANTOR
. I am a wholesale sponge merchant, and live at No. 6, Houndsditch. I was at home at the time this ocurred, but was not down stairs—I generally keep my sponge in cases, but this was in a bag-there are 25 lbs. weight of sponge in it—the value of it is 12l. wholesale—it is Smyrna sponge, which is used for carriages, horses, and stable use.

Cross-examined. Q. Where had you seen this sponge before it was missed? A. It was, perhaps, two yards inside the door—it was not exposed at all, but sewn up in this bag—my daughter and an errand-boy are generally in the shop.

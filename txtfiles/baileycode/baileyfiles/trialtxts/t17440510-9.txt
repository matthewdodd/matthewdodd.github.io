            . On the sixth of April I was called up at four o'clock in the morning, and found my shop broke open, and was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment. I heard the Prisoners had given aw ay several things, upon which I got a search warrant, and had them taken up; the men owned the breaking open the shop, that they were full two hours in it, and carried away the goods in a sack: the women owned that they stood watching, and that they were to give a sign if any body was coming by.

            . I had a search warrant directed to me from Justice Poulson, and I found all the goods mentioned in the indictment in Mr. Whiting's show-glass, and Mrs. Griffiths said they were her goods. I heard 
               
                  James 
                  Haycrast

                  Whiting 
               



            . I keep a shop in Holborn, and sell hard-ware, the women Prisoners came to me, and said they had some hard-ware to sell. I desired them to go to an alehouse, and told them I would come to them. I went, and they were all four together; all of them had some of the goods, I bought them, and gave them 17 s. and 9 d. for them.
Q. What may be the value of these goods?
Griffiths. I cannot say exactly, I believe 30 s. if they were to be sold they would bring more.

            . On Friday the 6th of April about six o'clock in the morning, I called Smytheman up, and we went out a chimney sweeping, and got as much foot as we sold for sixteen pence, and coming home I kicked my foot against a trunk, and carried it home, and the next day we sold those goods to Whiting for 9 s. and 6 d. [the other three Prisoners said they sold them to Whiting for 9 s. nad 6 d. ]
Griffiths. They stole the trunk out of my shop, and owned before the Justice that they burnt it, in order to prevent a discovery.

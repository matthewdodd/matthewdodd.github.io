JOHN FULLER. I live at Green-hill, Harrow, and am servant to Mr. Bailey - Mr.

                  Thrupp
               



             had taken the house for a short time. On the 7th of September I saw the prisoner with the fishing-road in his hand; I knew him, called to him by name, and he dropped it - there was another man with him; I took it up, and knew it to be Mr. Thrupp's - I had seen it at nine o'clock that morning laying by the pond in the orchard, with the line in the pond; the prisoner ran down the road, and I lost him - I afterwards saw him when Mrs. Thrupp was accusing him of it: he abused her very much, he said he had lost a cricket-ball and had come over for it - he said he would panch my head; I went to the public-house - he came out to fight me, but said nothing about the rod.

            . Aged 18.




               Transported for Seven Years for each Offence

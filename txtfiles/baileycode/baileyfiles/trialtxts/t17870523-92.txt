             sworn.
I lost the things on Monday week; they were in a wooden box. (The several articles enumerated by the prosecutrix that were in the box.) I saw the box and things the same day they were stolen; they were put down on paper at the Justices; the box stood by the bedside where I slept, I was a lodger; I went to bed about ten; I missed them in half an hour after I was in bed; they were found in the prisoner's possession the next morning, at seven o'clock under her bed, in Black and White Court, and a tub before the box; she was just getting up, and a young man who lived with her was dressing himself, when the patrol andI went in; 
               
                  Hannah
                   Wigfall
               



             was not there.
Whose lodgings were they? - I do not know; the box was locked, and I had the key in my pocket; the things were all in the box when the box was found; I lodged with 
               
                  Hannah
                   Wigfall
               



            , and paid her one shilling a week; Johnson called on Wigfall that afternoon, and was in my apartment; 
               
                  Hannah
                   Wigfall
               



             slept with me that night, and came last to bed, and left the door open; Wigfall was undressed as well as myself; I presently heard some body in the room, it might be half an hour; Wigfall was asleep, I awoke her, and got a light, and then went, and got a watchman; Wigfall said, to the best of her knowledge, she shut the door, and locked it, but upon getting up I found it wide open.


                  RICHARD
                   WILLEY
               



             sworn.
I am one of the patrol of St. Sepulchre's parish; on the 6th of March, 
               
                  Hannah
                   Wigfall
               



             was brought to our watch-house about eleven o'clock, on suspicion of robbing the prosecutrix; Wigfall was charged for assisting Johnson in the robbery; Wigfall was having words with the prosecutrix at the watch-house, which strengthened our suspicions; then she said Betty must have robbed her, meaning Johnson. (The box and things produced by Willey.) The box was broke open, and concealed under the bed, and a guinea and a half taken out, and some silver; I asked the prosecutrix if she had the key, she gave me her keys, and one of them opened the box; they have been in my possession ever since; the bundle, with a gown and coat lay by the box under the bed, which I afterwards put into the box, and locked it up.
(The things deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
Prosecutrix. I know the gowns by the pieces I mended them with, and by the trimming on one of them; there was a guinea and a half, and fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver; I have never seen any of the money since.
Willey. She swore to the things at the Justice's; they are the same I found at Johnson's lodgings; I went to thirty or forty places before I could find her; I saw Darby there, who will appear here presently and the prosecutrix; I took the two prisoners to the Compter.

             sworn.
I am a shoe-maker; I know nothing of the matter; I was going about my master's business, he lives in Blue-court, Old Bailey; the lodgings are mine.
Why did not Johnson sleep there that night; did not she cohabit with you? - No, not constantly; she said, she was locked out that night; I know no more.
Court. Did she never sleep with you before that night? - No, my Lord, she used to sweep my room and make my bed; she was a stranger to me.
Then how came she into your room? - I gave her the key to clean the room; I left nobody in my room.
Did you sleep that night with her, or did you not? - I was in bed with her; the key was hung on a nail on the outside of the door, for her to go in and clean the room; I know nothing of her else.
Did she leave the room any time that night after you went to bed? - No, my Lord, I know nothing how the box came in my room; I never saw them till the officer came and took them away.


                  WILLIAM

             sworn.
I am a watchman; on the 6th of March. I was going my rounds, and I heard the prosecutrix crying, I am robbed and ruined; Wigfall was with her; I said, can you tell who robbed you? some women that was with Wigfall directed us us to Black and White Court; upon enquiry,

             informed me, she saw a woman go into a house in the court with a box; the patrol found the box, and took them to the watch-house; she said, that it was no such thing.

I live at No. 20, Fleet-lane; I wasstanding at my door, about ten minutes after eleven o'clock; I saw Johnson coming from Seacoal-lane; she had been in my shop about two hours before; I keep a chandler's shop; I know her person very well; she had a bundle under her arm; I could not tell whether it was a box or what it was; and I heard say, she was robbed; I told them I saw a woman go up the alley with a bundle.
PRISONER JOHNSON'S DEFENCE.
I was moving some things; going to leave my lodgings, and carried several things to

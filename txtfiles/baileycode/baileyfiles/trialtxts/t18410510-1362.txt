JAMES WILSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of March, 1 time-piece, value 1l., the goods of 



William Mitchelhill.






ANN MUIRHEAD
. I am in the employ of Mr. William Mitchelhill, of Great Tichfield-street. On the 25th of March I saw his time-piece safe in the front-parlour at two o'clock, and missed it at half-past five.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Are there any lodgers in the house? A. Yes, three—Mr. Mitchelhill is a tailor—business prevents his being here—I have lived with him three years.





FREDERICK POOL
. I live with Mr. Priest, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre.

I have a time-piece, pawned on the afternoon of the 25th of March by the prisoner for 6s.—I forget in what name, having lost the duplicate—I am certain he is the man.





JOHN EATON
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of April, in company with another person, in a very bad house in Falcon-court, Soho—I found nine keys on the other person, which I applied to the prosecutor's street-door, and two of them would open it.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a man named Smith? A. Yes, a good many, but not in relation to this charge—no man named Smith gave me any information about this—the prisoner told the Magistrate that Smith had led him into it—that Smith I know has been under charge two or three times.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

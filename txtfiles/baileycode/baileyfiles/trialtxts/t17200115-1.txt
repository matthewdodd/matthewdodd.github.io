It appeared that Norris was very intimate with Mrs. Bustal, and complained to her that the Scarf Trade, which she (Norris) then followed, was very bad, and that she was in a very low Condition; whereupon the Prosecutor took her in out of Charity, and put great Confidence in her; committing all to her Charge while they went into the Country; that several things were lost out of the House, and Norris told the Prosecutor that there must be some private Thief in the House, who it would be impossible to discover while he kept two Servants; that he put Norris in the way of selling Cutlery Wares to the Shops in the City, turn'd away several Servants, but did not suspect Norris; till coming the Day mention'd in the Indictment to look out Goods, she was seen to take the Knives, Forks, and Buckles off the Compter and put them into her Petticoat, and go into the Back Shop with them, whereupon they Secur'd her; and searching Phillips's Lodging found some of their Goods there, and more at a Pawnbrokers in Hounsditch, where Phillip's had pawn'd them; they went also to Norris's House, and found several there. The Goods were produc'd in Court and own by the Prosecutor; and the Pawnbroker swore that Phillips had brought the Goods which he took in.

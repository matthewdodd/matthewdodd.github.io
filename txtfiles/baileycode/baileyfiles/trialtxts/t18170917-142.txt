WILLIAM WESTLEY. I am a constable. On the 19th of July I was at my door in Park-street, Islington, and saw the prisoner go into the field behind the workhouse, with a bundle; I followed him and asked him what he had got there, he said they were his dirty clothes, which were going to be washed; I insisted on searching it - He put it down and ran away - I secured him and found four geese, which appeared to have been strangled, they were quite hot, the feathers and pillow-case were wrapped up in the chaise-cover. I found a boat-hook, a chisel, and a large knife upon him-the marks on the door fitted the boat-hook; he said he got them at Hackney.

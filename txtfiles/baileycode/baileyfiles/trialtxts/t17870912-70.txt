The prosecutor was in liquor, and decoyed into a house by a woman he did not know; he fell in sleep, she left him, and two men, whom he believes to be the men prisoners came afterwards, and awoke him, then he missed his things; and the prisoner Knowland pawned the coat next day.
The prosecutor deposed to the coat, and

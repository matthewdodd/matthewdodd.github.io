            . On Wednesday, the 13th of November, I was in Rood-lane


 about a quarter before six o'clock; I turned round and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand putting it into his breast - I know it was in my pocket immediately before; I felt it pulled out which made me turn round; I took him, and recovered the handkerchief.
Prisoner. Q. What did you turn round and say you said nobody was with me? A. I did not say so; I seized him; I used no expression - he said he never touched my handkerchief; he dropped it and trod on it, and said he never touched it.

            . I am a wine merchant. I was passing Mr. Lloyd's, and saw the prisoner in the act of drawing the handkerchief - I said, "Sir, you are robbed;" he turned round and seized the prisoner; and I seized one of his companions.

            . I am servant to Mr. Owen. The soles were marked, and my master put me into the back parlour to watch, and about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, of the 24th of December, I saw the prisoner rubbing the counter down; he left off in the middle of it, took a pile of soles down off the shelf, selected two pairs, and put them into his bosom. He finished the counter, and went to clean my master's boots, and when my master came down, I told him, and took them out of his bosom myself.
MR. OWEN. I marked the soles, and put them on the shelf - they are mine.
Prisoner's Defence, written. I have been two years in the prosecutor's service, and am innocent. The property was found near to where I was standing cleaning boots, but I do not know how they came there.

            . I live at Chelsea; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment out of my father's house.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
A. Clark. I found this gown (producing one) on the prisoner's back when I saw her in the compter; I heard she was in Woodstreet compter, so I went and found her there; she was committed for something else.
Q. What is it made of?
A. Clark. It is silk and stuff; the pawnbroker has the shift body, and two aprons; he is here.
Q. When did you find them?
A. Clark. I found them about the beginning of August.
Q. Did the prisoner live in your house?
A. Clark. She came backwards and forwards a chairing in our house.
Q. What did the prisoner say for herself?
A. Clark. When I found my gown upon her she did not deny it.
Q. Did she say where she had it?
A. Clark. I did not ask her, because I knew where she had it; she told me where the stockings were in pawn, and I went and fetched them, and paid a shilling and a penny.

                  Morris 
               



            .
Q. Did you ask her whose they were?.
Tapper. I did not, because she had as good things upon her back.
Prisoner's Defence.
She lent me those things.
Q. to A. Clark. Upon your oath, did you lend the things to the prisoner?
A. Clark. Upon my oath I never did; I never lent her the worth of a halfpenny or farthing in my life; she never asked me to lend her any one thing; she has asked for a penny or two-pence to get her a dram, or I have told her to go to the public house in my name.

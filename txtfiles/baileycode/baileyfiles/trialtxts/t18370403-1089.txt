WILLIAM HORNE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
25th of February, 3 pairs of boot half-fronts, value 10s., the goods of 



Peter Frankland, his master.






PETER FRAKKLAND
. I am a shoemaker, and live in South-street, Manchester-square. The prisoner was my blocker and cleaner—he has worked for me during five or six years occasionally—on the 18th of March Mr. Lloyd brought me some half-fronts—I went to his house and found two more of them, making the three pairs of boot half-fronts—the prisoner had access to these—they are mine—they are worth 10s.—my name is on the inside of one pair, and they are all blocked on one piece of wood.






JAMES PAYNE LLOYD
. I life in Oxford-street, and a bootmaker. The prisoner had been in my employ, but misconducted himself and I discharged him—he came on the 25th of February and said he had bought a little leather, and made a few boot half-fronts—I bought two pain of him at the trade price—he then brought a pair of fronts, and I said they were damaged at the top, they were only fit for halves—he cut them in half—I then took them to the prosecutor, and he identified them.

Prisoner's Defence. I will not deny that I did take the fronts, but I was not conscious of what I was doing—I was labouring under an aberration of mind.

JAMES MURRELL
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
14th of February, 24lbs. weight of lead, value 5s., the goods of 



Thomas Bayman; and then being fixed to a building; against the Statute, &c.






JAMES SMITH
. I am a baker, living at Old Ford, in the parish of Bow. About twelve o'clock on Wednesday, the 14th of February, I was putting on my coat in the bed-room, and saw the prisoners' hands over the roof of the prosecutor's house—I watched them, and saw them drag a sack over—I ran down, got assistance, went into the field which they went into, and took them with the lead in the sack—I sent for the policeman—I asked them who cut the lead—Howard said two pieces had been cut, and two they cut—I asked for theknife, and he produced a glazier's knife—I asked what induced them to go there—they said they came by the preceding day, and saw two boys up there, and they went that day to see what they had been about.





THOMAS BAYMAN
. This house is mine—it is at Old Ford—this lead was fixed on the roof of my house—they took all the lead—I expect I have lost 2 1/4 cwt. of lead—this is part of the gutters—(looking at it)—it was a fixed gutter.





JOHN REVELL
 (police-constable K 176.) This is the lead—I took the prisoners in charge.





JAMES SMITH
. I saw this fitted to the roof, and the other piece also—it fits it, and I saw it taken from the roof.

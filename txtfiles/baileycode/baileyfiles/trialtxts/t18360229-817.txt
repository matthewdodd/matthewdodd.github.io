WILLIAM MAY
. I live at No. 8, King-street, Hackney-road, in Bethnal-green. I let one room—the prisoner called on me on the Friday, and engaged an apartment for his mother, whom he asked was coming out of service—on the next day he and his mother came late in the evening, about nine o'clock—they remained in the room one week—at the end of the wee, on the 10th of February, they left it—I missed my great coat and shawl, and all the things in the room belonging to the bed—every thing worth taking away—I found the coat at the pawnbroker's.





THOMAS COOMBS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Chruch-street, Bethnal-green. I have a great coat, pawned on the 10th of February by the prisoner.





SAMUEL MIMNOCK
 (police-constable H 81.) I produce a duplicate for a bolster and sheet, pledged for 7s. at the house of the last witness—I found it on the prisoner—they do not allude to this charge—nothing but the coat was found of these things.




GUILTY

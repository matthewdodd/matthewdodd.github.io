THOMAS THIMBLEBY
. I live in Hatton-garden. On the 4th of November I was passing through Newgate-streets, about twelve o'clock, and felt my coat tail moved—I turned and saw Boulton in custody—my handkerchief was gone from my pocket—I saw Green when I turned round—he

was a short distance before Buolton—this is my handkerchief—it was taken out of Buolton's jacket pocket.





THOMAS HOBBS
 (police-constable C 85.) I saw the prisoners in Oxford-street about ten o'clock in the morning, and watched them down Holborn to Newgate-street, when I saw Buolton put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out this handkerchief and put it into his own pocket—Green at the time was holding out his own coat that people should not see what Buolton did—I took them, and took the handkerchief out of his pocket—I asked Buolton, when I took him to prisoner, where he lived—he said, "I do'nt do business so."

Green. I was not in company with this young man—I do not know him—I had my hands in my pockets all the way. Witness. They were talking together all down Holborn, and Green waited at the corner of a court facing the Old Bailey till Buolton, who went down there, came out again.

BUOLTON—

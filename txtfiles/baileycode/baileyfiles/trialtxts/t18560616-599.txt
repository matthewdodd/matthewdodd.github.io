MR. W. J. PAYNE
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN SMITH
. I am porter to Mr. Robert Overbury; he occupies a warehouse on the ground floor of No. 13, Basinghall-street, in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw. Mr. Nathaniel Overbury keeps goods there, but he is not in partnership with Mr. Robert Overbury—the ware-house is on the ground floor in front, and at the back there is a counting house, which has a skylight over the whole of it—Mr. Salaman is a solicitor, and he occupies an office over the warehouse—there is nothing over the counting house—there is a window from Mr. Salaman's office which comes to the skylight—on 7th May there were some boards lying on the skylight—the workmen had been at work the day before, laying some lead on—I know Mason's-alley—there is a wall there, over which you can get to our premises—there is just one warehouse between Mr. Overbury's warehouse and the alley, and by getting over that wall access could he had to our premises—that is the way the workmen went up—on the evening of 7th May I left the warehouse about 25 minutes past 6 o'clock—I was the last person who left—I locked the warehouse door, and took the two keys with me, a Chubb patent lock, and another lock—at that time everything was safe—on the following morning I was called to the warehouse at a little after 6 o'clock—my residence is at No, 27, Basinghall-street—I went to the warehouse, and found two policemen there—I saw seven pieces of woollen goods near the street door—some of them were Mr. Robert Overbury's—the greater part were Mr. Nathaniel Overbury's—they were in the warehouse, and covered up, when I left on the previous evening—they had just come in—they were given back to us by order of the Magistrate, because we had them for an order—I went from the street door to the warehouse door, which is on the left hand side of the passage—that was the door that I had left locked, and both the staples were off—the screws had been drawn—the bolts of the locks were shot—they must have been opened from the inside of the warehouse—there is an alarm bell there, the wire of that was let loose, and the hammer was down on the bell, so that it could not strike by opening or shutting the door—I found five or six more pieces of cloth had been removed—I noticed the skylight of the counting house—there is a counter under the skylight, and on the counter there was a plank in an inclined position from the skylight down to the counter, so that any one could slide down—a pane of glass had been taken out of the skylight—that glass was all safe the night before—I went up stairs to Mr. Salaman's office—I found the door of his back office had been broken open from the inside—that could have been done by getting in at the window from the skylight, and the window was

open, as if the men had escaped from that window—I presume that I had seen the prisoner Williams walking down Basinghall-street.





RICHARD STREAT
. I am clerk to Mr. Joseph Seymour Salaman; he is a solicitor. He has an office on the first floor, over this warehouse, in Basing-hall-street—I left the office about half pant 4 o'clock in the afternoon on 7th May—this cash box was then in Mr. Salaman's office, on the ledge of the window that leads to the skylight—it was empty—I had locked my desk when I left, and when I got there the next morning, about a quarter before 10 o'clock, it had been broken open—this is Mr. Salaman's cash box.





FREDERICK STEPHENS
 (City policeman, 142). On the morning of 8th May I was on duty in Mason's-alley, about 3 o'clock—there is a wall there, over which you can get to Mr. Overbury's—I saw some marks on the wall, and I kept a watch close by it till 5 minutes past 6 o'clock—I should think the wall is fifteen or sixteen feet high—about 5 minutes past 6 o'clock I heard a noise on the other side of the wall, as I was in the alley, and I saw Williams on the top of the wall, and he jumped down into the alley—I saw two other persons come and look over the wall, but as soon as they saw me they drew back—I believe one of the two men was Young, but I only saw the side of his face, and I cannot be sure—I went in chase of Williams—I went to the premises about half put 6 o'clock—I found sergeant Speck there.





WILLIAM EDWARDS
 (City policeman, 114). On the morning of 8th May I was on duty just at the corner of Mason's-alley, just after 6 o'clock—I heard the cry of "Thieves!" inside the premises, on the other side of the wall—I went into the alley, and saw Williams come to the wall, and jump into the alley—I saw Young come to the wall; he looked down, and saw me, and went back again—I had sufficient sight of him to know that he was the person, I looked at him for half a minute—I tried to get up the wall, but I could not catch him—I got assistance, and went after him, but he got away—from information, I went on 12th May to Coldbath-fields prison, and four or five persons were marched into the yard—I identified Young as being the man I saw on the wall—I have no doubt about him—he was then in Coldbath-fields for assaulting a policeman—I took him on this charge on 7th June, and took him to the station—Mrs. Bishop, the housekeeper, came to the station—I placed Young with seven or eight other persons, and she picked him out as being the man—I told him the charge when I took him—he did not say anything.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. What time did you see Young on the wall? A. About 6 o'clock in the morning—I saw him again on the 12th, which was four days afterwards—I heard that he was in the prison, and went there—he had a badge on, I believe—I did not inquire for him by name—I was not told the name before I went—I believe there were three persons in the yard besides him.





SAMUEL SPECK
 (City police sergeant, 87). On 8th May, about 5 minutes past 6 o'clock in the morning, I was in Fore-street—the prisoner Young came running to me from New Basinghall-street—he was coming in a direction from Mason's-alley—it would take a man about two minutes to run there from Basinghall-street—I was on the opposite side of Fore-street, and he came running towards me with his coat on his left arm, crying "Fire!"—I approached him, and asked him where the fire was—he said, "Up there; for God's sake, sergeant, make haste, they will all be burnt! I am going for the engine"—I immediately ran towards Mason's-alley, and when I got some distance I met Stephens with Williams in custody—I then

discovered that it was a hoax—I went after Young, but I could not find him—I then went to the warehouse, I got there about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock—the street door was shut; Mrs. Bishop, the housekeeper, opened it to me immediately—when I got in at the street door, I found some pieces of cloth in the passage behind the door—I saw the door leading from the passage into the warehouse—the box into which the lock enters was removed—I examined the counting house, I found the glass in the skylight had been removed, and a long scaffolding board put through where the glass had been removed, and was resting on the counter in the counting house, in a slanting direction—the aperture in the skylight was plenty large enough for a man to get through, and to slide down—I proceeded on to the leads, and found this screwdriver, this wax taper, this gimlet, this knife, and this rope, about ten yards long, on the leads, which go over another counting house, and then to the wall of Mason's-alley—I examined Mr. Salaman's office, I found the desk broken open, and this jemmy fitted the indentation in the desk, near the lock, where it had been prised open—the door also had been prised open, and the indentation on the door corresponded with this jemmy—I found this cash box, and seven pieces of cloth in the passage, behind the street door—on 12th May I went with Edwards to Coldbath Fields prison—I was shown about half a dozen persons, and when they marched by second time, I picked out Young as the person I had seen on the morning of the 8th.

COURT. Q. Who pointed him out first? A. I said, "That is the man," and Edwards said, "Yes, it is"—I have not the least doubt now that he is the man.

Cross-examined. Q. Were there any other persons running in Fore-street? A. No, none whatever—it is not more than 150 yards from Mason's-alley.





HANNAH BISHOP
. I am housekeeper to Mr. Anthony Locke; he is the landlord of No. 13, Basinghall-street. I sleep on the premises, at the top of the house—on the night of 7th May, I fastened the street door at half past 9 o'clock—at that time the house was all safe—on the following morning, the 8th, there was a knock at the door directly after the clock struck 6—I went down part of the way, and hearing a noise it gave me rather a start (I had expected a man to come at 6 o'clock)—when I got to the second flight of stairs, I saw Mr. Salaman's office door open—I got to the foot of the stairs against the door, and saw three men inside the office—they went out of the window over the desk, and got on to the skylight—I said, "What are you doing here?"—they made no answer—I went to the window, and saw the three men going to the wall of Mason's-alley—they were on their hands and knees, scrambling over towards the wall—I called, "Thieves!"—one of them went over the wall, the others attempted to go over, and turned back, and went over into the churchyard—I still called, "Thieves!" and they got away—I went down and opened the door—I saw the goods behind the door—I found at the door the man that was come to do the work—I sent him for Mr. Overbury's porter—the prisoners are two of the men that I saw that morning, I have not the least doubt of it—I went to the station, and there I saw Williams.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you taken to the station a second time? A. Yes, to pick out Young—when I saw those persons scrambling on the leads, I was looking down upon them, of course—they were on their hands and knees—I did not see their faces particularly—I mean I did not see their full faces—I do not know on what day it was I went to the station the

second time, I did not take particular notice—it was a month afterward, when Young came out of prison—I think it was last Saturday week—they said they had got another of the prisoners, and I was to go to see if I knew him—when I got there, at the first glance I was rather surprised or puzzled, bat I considered a bit, and looked at him again, and I said that was him, and the policeman wished me to go and touch him that he might know who I pointed to, and I did so—there were six or seven more persons.

MR. W. J. PAYNE. Q. The first time you went was on the day you saw those men on the leads? A. Yes; and the second time was on the 8th June.





JOHN CHOWN
 (policeman, E 137). I know both the prisoners well—I have known Young about sixteen months—I have seen them together repeatedly—I have every reason to believe that they live together—I have followed them to No. 9, Bell-court, I hare watched them go in, and come out in another dress—I saw them go into the same house, and come out again, about three weeks before this occurrence.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know as a fact that Young lived there? A. I cannot say that he is a tenant—I have seen him go there.





WALTER HOPE
 (police sergeant, F 50). I know both the prisoners, and have seen them together repeatedly—I saw them a few nights before they were taken—I have seen them repeatedly at the corner of Bell-court, but have not seen them in the house.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that Young lived at No. 13, Plum-tree-court? A. No.





HENRY BINGHAM
 (police sergeant, E 5). I know the prisoners very well, I have seen them together repeatedly in Holborn—I cannot say where they lived

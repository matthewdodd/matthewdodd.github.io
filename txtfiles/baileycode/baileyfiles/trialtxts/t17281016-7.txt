, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a silver Tankard, in the Dwelling-House

                  George 
                  Allard

                  Tho 
                  Carey 
               



            , Servant to the Prosecutor depos'd, That he took the Tankard from the Prisoner, who had it in his Hand, under his Coat, endeavouring to conceal it. That he saw the Prisoner drinking a Pint of Beer at the Bar just before, and asked the Bar-Keeper if she miss'd nothing, who looking about, miss'd a Tankard, which appear'd to be the same that was found upon him by this Deponent. He said in his Defence, That he being very well acquainted with the Bar-Keeper, took the Tankard to surprize her, tho' it appear'd, that he made a contrary Excuse, when taken, saying, The Bar-Keeper had given it him, to fetch her some Water in; but before a Magistrate, he confess'd the Fact, and sign'd his Confession, with his own Hand, which being read in Court, together with the plain Evidence against him, the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

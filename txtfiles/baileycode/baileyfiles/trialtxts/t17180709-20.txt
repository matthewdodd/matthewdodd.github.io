             , the 18th of June
 last. It appear'd by the Evidence that the Prisner was Coachman
 to the Prosecutor, who was Sugar-baker, and that the Sugar was hid under the Manger in the Stable. The Prisoner pleaded that one Lump was given him by one of the Men, and that he had bought the rest; but not proving it, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

WILLIAM CARTER
 was indicted

 for stealing 7 1/2 lbs. weight of beef, value 3s., the goods of 



Samuel Guerrier; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD HARBISON
. I am in the employ of Mr. Samuel Guerrier, a butcher, of Islington. On the 31st of Oct. he had a piece of beef safe on the front board of his shop, about five o'clock—I missed it, and in about five minutes afterwards the policeman brought it back to the shop—it was my master's.





CHARLES WRIGHT
 (police-constable N 304.) I stopped the prisoner that night—he had this piece of beef in his handkerchief, under his left arm—I asked him what he had got, he said, "I don't know"—I took it from him, and said, "It is meat, where did you get it?"—he said he brought it from Newgatemarket—I said I did not believe him—I took him and the beef to the prosecutor's.





JOHN BARTROP
 (police-constable N 69.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell—(read)—the prisoner is the man.

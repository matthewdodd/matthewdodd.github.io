            . I did not perceive my pocket was picked, until the officer told me of it.

JOHN CARLISLE. I am a City officer. I was at Bow fair


, on the 6th of June; I saw the prisoner in company with two little boys; I was close to him. He shoved the two little boys up against the prosecutor's pocket, and I heard him say, go it, to one of them; neither of the boys appeared to be nine years old; the boys seemed rather timid; and the prisoner seemed very angry, and kept shoving them. Then one of the boys, put his little fingers to the pocket, and raised the handkerchief. The prisoner then pulled the boy back, and got close up behind the gentleman himself; he then took the handkerchief out of the pocket, and clapped it into his own waistcoat. I immediately seized him, and the little ones run away.

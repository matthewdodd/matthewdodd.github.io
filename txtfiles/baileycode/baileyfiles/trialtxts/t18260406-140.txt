            . I saw the prisoner, on the 6th of March, go into Mr. Smith's house with some matches, he asked if they would buy any - he came out, looked round the door and went in again three times - he then went in and came out with a bundle - I was in a house opposite - I ran out and called Mr. Smith, and asked if he had lost any thing - he said "Yes, my jacket;" I ran after the prisoner and he was taken - I had not lost sight of him - he threw the jacket on the ground.

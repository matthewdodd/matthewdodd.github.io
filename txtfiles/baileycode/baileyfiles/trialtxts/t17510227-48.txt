The prisoner was found by the prosecutor (who sells tobacco
) behind his counter with the two pair of scales in his hand, which the prosecutor had but a little before seen hanging up in the usual place.
The prisoner in his defence said, he went into this shop for a halfpenny worth of tobacco, and found nobody in the shop. But denied he meddled with any thing.

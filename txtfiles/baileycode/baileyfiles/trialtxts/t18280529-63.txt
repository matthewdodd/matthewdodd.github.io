WILLIAM WATTS. On the 29th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, I was in Cockspur-street


; I felt my handkerchief drawn from me, and turned round; I saw the prisoner and another person close to me - I saw their hands shuffle together, and my handkerchief go from one to the other; I gave the prisoner in charge to a watchman, and on the road to the watch-house the prisoner dropped the handkerchief; I had not lost sight of him - he sneaked across the road.

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner - I did not see the handkerchief fall.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Clare-market - there was no person near me; a person walked past the watchman - the prosecutor then tapped him on the shoulder, and told him to take me; I know nothing of the handkerchief - there were several persons passing.

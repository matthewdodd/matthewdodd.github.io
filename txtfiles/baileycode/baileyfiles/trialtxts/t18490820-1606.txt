ELIZABETH RICHARDSON



, stealing 3 pairs of braces, and other goods, value 4l. 14s.; of 



Samuel Parsey, in his dwelling-house; having been before convicted.


MR. ROBINSON
conducted the Prosecution.






SAMUEL PARSEY
. I am a hosier and glover in Piccadilly, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square; the prisoner was servant to a lady who lives in the house—I had missed a quantity of property from my shop when no one but the prisoner was in the house, and when I had locked my shop door I called in the policeman, and we found handkerchiefs, braces, and other things of my property in the prisoner's box.





WILLIAM GODFREY
 (policeman, C 47). I have produced these articles, which were found in the prisoner's box.

Prisoner. I have been more living with the prosecutor than anybody else, because my mistress has not been at home; I was in the shop with him; we were intimate together.





SAMUEL PARSEY

re-examined. I deny that; she was not in the shop with me, without she was sent to buy a pair of gloves—I never gave her authority to take any of these things—she had not access to the shop, because I always locked it at night, and kept the key in my pocket—I cannot tell how she got into the shop, without she opened my locks—one was a common lock on the door, and the other a padlock—I am not married. (The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read u I did take them, Sir.")





MICAIAH READ
 (policeman). 'I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted October, 1847, confined one year)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

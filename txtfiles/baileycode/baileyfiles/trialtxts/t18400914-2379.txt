SAMUEL POLLARD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

JAMES SMITH
. I am waiter at the Crown and Sceptre tavern, Greenwich. I lost two coats from a room there, from behind the door, I left them there on the 20th of August, tied in a blue handkerchief—the prisoner was occasionally employed on the premises—(produced)—these are them and the handkerchief—they are worth 1l.





EDWARD CURTIS
. I am shopman to Mr. Nash, a pawnbroker, of London-street, Greenwich. On the 22nd of August, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner pawned these two coats, in the name of John Mills, Bell-street—he said they were his brother's, and being both of one size I did not suspect he bad stolen them—I lent him 3s. on them—they were not worth more.





JOHN BRAISTED WITSMORE
 (police-constable R 68.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd—he was afterwards charged with this offence.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Deptford, and saw a man who pulled me aside, and asked me to go and pawn the two coats; I said I would; he said he would give me 6d. He told me to ask 4s. on one, and 5s. on the other. I went to the pawnbroker's, and told him they were my brother's. I went out, and asked the man if he would take what they offered; he said, "Yes." I gave him the money; he sent me to get two sixpences for a shilling, which I did, and he gave me 6d.




GUILTY
.** Aged. 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

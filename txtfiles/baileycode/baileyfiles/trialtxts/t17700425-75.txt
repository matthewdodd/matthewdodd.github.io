            . I am servant to Mr. Isherwood, who keeps a Manchester warehouse
 in Bow-church-yard


. The prisoner and another Jew came into our shop; I think it was the 17th of April 1769, between six and seven in the morning, under pretence of buying old clothes; as I was shewing some, the prisoner ran away with a piece of white jean from off the counter; twenty yards of it: they bought no clothes. I missed it immediately after they were gone; I went out to see for him; the other was then in the shop. I found the prisoner in the church-yard. I brought him back. He threw the piece down, and got away. I never saw him since till now. (the piece produced in court and deposed to). The other person was kept in the warehouse till my master came down. He was carried before my lord mayor and discharged.

            . One day I went with the prisoner past this house, along with the other man that was with him. I wanted to go into that warehouse; the prisoner said, Do not go in there, because it is dangerous; this is the house in which I took a piece of white goods, and was taken, and I left the goods and got away. These two men have been concerned with me in several other robberies.

I never saw the shop.

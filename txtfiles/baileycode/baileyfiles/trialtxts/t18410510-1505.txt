RICHARD HENRY BEAUMONT
. I live in Nottinghamshire. On the 14th of April, in the evening, I was at Greenwich Fair—I had a handker-chief in my pocket—I missed it about seven o'clock, as I was walking through the fair, the officer touched me, and I saw my handkerchief in his hand, and the prisoner was by the officer's side—this is my handker-chief.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I was at the fair, and saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handker-chief

—I took him with it—he dropped it—I took it up, and spoke to the prosecutor—he identified it as his—I had been watching the prisoner, and saw him try many other pockets besides.

Prisoner. I did not take it at all.

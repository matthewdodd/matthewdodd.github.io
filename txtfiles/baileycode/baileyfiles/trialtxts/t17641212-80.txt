            . I keep a public-house
, in the Borough. I lost a silver spoon, on the 23d of November: it was stopped, and advertised on the Tuesday following. I sent after it, and the pawnbroker came to me: I suspecting the prisoners, he declared they brought it to him: they both then confessed that they carried the spoon to the pawnbroker's the man said he found it in Red-lion-street; then he said he found it in Three Crown-court; and, after that, on the back of Three Crown-court.

            , the pawnbroker, deposed, the woman brought the spoon to pledge to him; he did not chuse to take it in, without somebody to prove it was her property. She went, and fetched her husband; he went for somebody to his character, but did not return; so he advertised it, by which means the prosecutor got it again.

RICHARD MARTIN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the

Charles Hawkins.






WILLIAM DYKER
. I am shopman to Charles Hawkins, a linen-draper, in Tottenham-court-road. On the 19th of September this flannel, with the calico round it, was exposed for sale outside the door—I missed it about eleven o'clock in the morning—I know it by the mark on it—(looking at it.)





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) I stopped the prisoner on the 19th of September in King-street, going towards Long-acre, with this roll of flannel—he said a strange man gave it him to take to the Bull Inn in Holborn.




GUILTY.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

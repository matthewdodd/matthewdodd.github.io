            . I am a labourer
, and come from Bristol. On the 2nd of January, between two and three o'clock in the day, I was in Jews'-row, Chelsea - I am a pensioner. I met the prisoner - I was rather tipsy. She asked me if had got my pension. I said Yes. She told me to come home to her place, and she would take care of me. I went to her room, and sat on the bed. I fell asleep, and felt her hand in my pocket - I got up, and missed my money; she ran into another room - I brought her back, and held her. She struck and scratched me. The constable came in, and found the sovereign and half crown in her stocking.

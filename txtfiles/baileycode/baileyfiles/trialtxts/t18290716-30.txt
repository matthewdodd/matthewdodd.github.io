. About a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, on the 30th of June, the prisoner came and wished to be served with a yard of ribbon; I stooped to get it from under the counter, and when I got up I saw her closing her shawl I, but did not think she had had time to take any thing - when she was gone I missed a pair of shoes; I followed her with an officer, and found two pairs of shoes on her - she said she had bought them, and would go with me to the shop, but I knew them to be mine.
Prisoner's Defence. A woman, named King, told me to go and take them for her.

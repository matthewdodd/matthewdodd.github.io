            . I am a linen-draper
. These stockings were laying on my counter - no person could have taken them without coming into the shop. I was at dinner in the sitting room, and saw the prisoner come in and ask my young man for something - he took something from the counter, and ran away; I ran into the shop and told my man, who pursued him, and brought him back.

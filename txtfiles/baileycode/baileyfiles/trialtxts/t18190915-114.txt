HEMMING HEWETT. I am clerk to a merchant
, and live in George-street, Minories. On the 12th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was on Ludgate-hill


; Mr. Nalder came and asked me if I had lost my handkerchief - I missed it; the prisoner was pointed out, and I secured him - my handkerchief was not found. He denied the charge.

            . I live with my father, who is a glover. On the 12th of August I was in St. Paul's Church-yard, and observed the prisoner with two others; they attempted the pockets of several people. I followed them to Ludgate-hill, then saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take a handkerchief out; he gave it to his companions. He then went down Dolphin-court; I lost him, but caught sight of him again opposite the Old Bailey, and secured him.
Prisoner's Defence. I ran over on the left hand side of the street.

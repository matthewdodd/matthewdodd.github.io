RICHARD RUSSELL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
23rd of February, 1 coat, Value 1l., the goods of 



Joseph Holland; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SELITA WHITELAW
. I live in Sussex-street, Tottenham Court-road. Between seven and eight o'clock, on the 23rd of February, I was in my kitchen, and heard footsteps in the front-parlour, I ran up immediately—I found the street-door nearly wide open, and my parlour-door also, which I had left locked a few minutes before, leaving the key in it—I said, "Who is in the parlour?"—no one came out—I stood, on the mat outside the door, and said again, "Who is in the front-parlour?"—the prisoner then came from the cupboard, in the corner of the parlour, with this coat on his arm—he rushed by me and ran out—I ran and calked "Stop thief"—he shut me in the passage—I got the door open as soon as I called, and called "Stop thief"—a man with a wood-cart called out also—I followed, and saw the prisoner throw down the coat at the corner of Pancras-street—the man who was following him picked it up and gave it to me—I then returned—the prisoner was brought back in two or three minutes—I am confident he is the man—this coat belongs to Joseph Holland, who is our apprentice, and lives with us.

Prisoner. You cannot swear that I am the person? Witness, Yes, I can—there is a gas-light opposite our door, and the parlour-blinds were up, quite to the top—I can see to read in the parlour by the gaslight.





JOHN NEWLAND
. I was at the corner of Pancras-street, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner threw this coat down at my feet—I am sure he the person.






THOMAS COOPER
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.

Prisoner. I hope you will be merciful.

             The prisoner was my servant
.
Q. What are you?
Maynard. I am a butcher
.
Q. Did she know where you put your money?
Maynard. She know it was in the drawers; I gave her an order to make the bed, and lock the door, and take care of the key, and let nobody come into the room. After that I missed two guineas, and asked her if she had taken them; she owned she did take them; I ask'd her how she came at them; she said she had got a key that would open the lock; but when she found I had missed my money, she threw it down the necessary-house. I had my key in my pocket all the time. I took her before the alderman, there she owned the same.
Mr. Smith. I was with the prosecutor and the prisoner, and heard her confess the same as he has mentioned.
Q. Were there any threatenings made use of in order to induce her to confess?
Smith. No, none at all, nor no promises of forgiveness.

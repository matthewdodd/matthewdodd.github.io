            . I keep a green-grocer's shop in Spafields


. On the 30th of September, I left my shop, to take my little boy to school - I left 1s., 111/2d., and two farthings, on a tea-board in the back parlour - when I came back, I met the prisoner coming out of my house; I asked what he wanted - he said, an apple; I said, "Perhaps you have been into my room;" I looked and the money was gone - my sister came in at the time, and said, I had better send for an officer; I asked, if he would give up the money? he said, it was 2s., and he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled it out; he was then very saucy - the officer came by and asked what was the matter.

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner from Cooper - I asked what it was for; he said, "For taking some money from a woman's shop."
Prisoner's Defence. I went to buy a halfpenny-worth of apples; I saw the money lay on a board, I took it up, and put it into my pocket; the woman came in and said, she had lost some money; I gave it her, and said, I was very sorry.

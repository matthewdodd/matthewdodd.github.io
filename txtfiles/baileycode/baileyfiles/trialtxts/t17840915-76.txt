             sworn.
I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, I saw them before dinner, there was no light in the house; the prisoner was employed to clean knives
; I found the things last Thursday, at Mr. Harding's, in the Minories; the prisoner went past my door, and my mother took him and stopped him; he confessed what he had done with them, I had not seen them from the time they were lost till then; he said he had suffered the law for them, he had been imprisoned, he was stopped with them: Mr. Harding stopped him, and advertized them.
(The spoon and table cloth produced.)

             sworn.
I am a goldsmith, I have a spoon broke in two; the prisoner at the bar brought me this spoon and table cloth, and said he found them coming from Hampstead, as he was mushrooming on Primrose-hill; the spoon was wrapped in the table cloth, I stopped him and sent him to prison.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

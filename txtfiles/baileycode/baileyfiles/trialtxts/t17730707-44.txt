Hawes. I am matron at the work house: the prisoner is one of the poor of the parish. On the 24th of January she eloped; I missed the things; I made enquiry after her; but heard nothing of her till June, when I met with her accidentally, and charged her with stealing the things, and I found them at the pawnbroker's according to her direction. I found them at Mr. Bruin's, and some at a pawnbroker's by the side of Fleet market.

            . I am servant to Mr. Bruin, a pawnbroker, on Snow hill; the prisoner pawned two pair of stockings at our house; I believe the stockings produced are them; they have been three weeks out of our custody.

- Lloyd. The constable and I found the stockings at Mr. Bruin's. The prisoner owned when she was taken, that she took the things, and told us where they were.

            . I have had the possession of the things; they were delivered to me in the presence of Mr. Lloyd; she confessed when she was taken where she had pawned the things, and said they were almost starved to death for want of victuals.

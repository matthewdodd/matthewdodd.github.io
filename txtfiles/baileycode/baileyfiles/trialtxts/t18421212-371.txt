WILLIAM CONSETT WRIGHT
. This officer produced me two lumps of coals which I compared with the coals in my barge—they corresponded as far as I can judge.






JOSEPH SHAIN
 (Thames police-constable, No. 40.) On the 12th of Dec. I saw the prisoner go down the stairs at Ratcliff—he went into the third room of Mr. Wright's barge—he steeped down and took up what appeared to be a loop of coal—he put it under the barge's head—he then returned to the fifth room, and again picked up something which appeared to be a lump of coal—I went round and met him with one piece on his head, which appeared to weigh about 30lbs.—I showed the same coals to Mr. Wright.




GUILTY
.* Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Yean—Convict Ship.

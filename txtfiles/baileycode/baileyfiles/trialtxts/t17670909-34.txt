            ; I lost a petticoat and an apron out of my room in Hungerford-market


; the prisoner was my servant
, I went out and left her in the house; when I returned she and the things were gone; I found the door locked, and my child sleeping in the bed; I found them again at the pawnbroker's.

            . The prosecutor came to me, and desired I would take the prisoner; I took her up with the apron upon her, which Mrs. Crosby owned; I put her in the Round-house; she confessed the petticoat, and another, was at a pawnbroker's at the bottom of Leicester-fields.

            . I am servant to a pawnbroker, the prisoner pledged this petticoat and apron with me (produced and deposed to.)

It is right enough what they say, I owed money, and I did it for want.

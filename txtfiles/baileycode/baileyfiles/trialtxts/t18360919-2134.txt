GEORGE KEMP
. I am a policeman. On the 5th of September I was on duty in Old-street-road, and saw the prisoner, in company with two other persons, loitering about several shops—they came to the prosecutor's—I saw them pass the shop several times—I saw the prisoner stand by the side of the shop—his two companions each took a piece of bacon—I followed, and secured the three in my arms—the prisoner had the two pieces

of bacon under his coat—the others two got away—I kept the prisoner and the bacon.





BENJAMIN MUGGERIDGE
. I am a cheesemonger. This bacon was in my shop, and taken from the window.

Prisoner' Defence. I left home on Monday afternoon to go to the fair with six boys—we staid there till dark, and they brought me home down Old-street, and took down six pair of trowsers, and then went on to this bacon-shop, and two of them took two pieces of bacon, which they gave me to carry.
(Thomas Harper, a weaver, of Violet-street, Bethnal-green, gave the prisoner a good character.)

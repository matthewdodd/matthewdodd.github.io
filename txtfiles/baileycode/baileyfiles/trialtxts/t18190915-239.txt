            . I am a mariner
. On the 4th of September, I was standing at the door of the Nag's Head public-house, Whitechapel - I was quite sober. The prisoner came up, and said there was a shipmate of mine at her house, which she said was a few doors off; I went to the door with her, and she got a light and opened it. I went into the lower room, but saw no person there - the door was closed. She blew the candle out, and pulled my watch out; I am sure she is the person - I went there for no improper purpose. I gave information, and on the 15th she was taken.

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street Office. I apprehended the prisoner in Catharine-wheel-alley, Essex-street. I went every evening to the house where she took the prosecutor to, but could not find her - it was in Black Lion-yard.

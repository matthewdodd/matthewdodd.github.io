            , a haberdasher
, of Fore-street. On the 16th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was in the shop; the prisoner came in to beg - he took a piece of sheeting-cloth, and went away with it; I immediately followed him to the corner of Aldermanbury Postern - I called Stop thief! and he was stopped before I lost sight of him; I saw the cloth fall off his shoulder directly I called Stop thief! it was delivered over to the officer - he said he had done nothing, and what did I detain him for.
Prisoner. Q.Are you certain it was in the shop? A. It was six feet within the shop - just against the inner door in the lobby.
RICHARD DOWNES. I am a porter. I heard a cry of Stop thief! as the prisoner came along - I laid hold of him, and saw the cloth on the pavement; Beaumont claimed it - I took him back - an officer was sent for.

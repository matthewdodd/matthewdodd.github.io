            . I am a watchman at the Steel-Yard


. On Wednesday last between twelve and one o'clock at noon. as I was coming down the yard, I met the prisoner with a bar upon his shoulder, within four yards of the place where the iron stands, within four yards of the gateway; he was going towards Thames-street; I thought he had stole it; I went up to him, and charged him with stealing the iror; he said a man bid him carry it to the farriers; I took him to the farriers; they knew nothing of it. The bar was the outside of the heap and had the number on it, and the initial letters of the merchants, T. P. for Thomson and Peters. The wharf belongs to

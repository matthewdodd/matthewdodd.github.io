1586. 




JOHN PATEY
 was indicted

 fro stealing 1 watch, value 3l., the goods of 



Joseph Robinson Hadfield, his master; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH ROBINSON HADFIELD.
 I live at No.326, High Holborn—I engaged the prisoner as errand-boy. On the 9th of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning I sent him up to my room for a pair of trowsers—there was a watch in the room on the drawers—I went into the room at eleven o'clock; the watch was then gone—this produced is it.





DAVID JONES.
 I am a pawnbroker. On the 9th of June I received this watch in pledge, not of the prisoner, but of a man larger grown—application was made, we referred to our books, and found it.





WILLIAM WEST
 (policeman.) I received information, went to the pawnbroker's, and found the watch—I took the prisoner, and told him he was charged with stealing a watch—he said he knew nothing about it—he afterwards said he stole the watch, but did not pledge it—I explained to him what watch I was talking about.





DAVID HEWETT
 (City police-constable, No. 233.) The signature to this deposition is Mr. Alderman Johnson's writing—(read—the prisoner voluntarily says, "I took the watch, but did not pawn it; Mr. Jones is quite correct.")





THOMAS GURNEY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 1846, and confined six weeks)—he is the person so tried and convicted.




GUILTY. Aged 19.—


Transported For Seven Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

JOHN DASTON. I lodge in Little Carlile-street. On the 20th of October, I went to dinner from No. 43, Tottenham-court-road


 where I was at work; on my return I found the premises safe to appearance, but missed a saw and a smoothing plane.

            . I am apprentice to a pawnbroker in Tottenham-court-road. On the 20th of Ocotber the prisoner pawned this saw and plane for 3s. - he came the next day with another saw, and was stopped.
Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I pawned them? A. Yes - you pawned them separately; I could not swear that he went out of the shop; he then brought the other articles and the two chisels - the saw is pawned in the name of William Griffiths; he appeared like a carpenter.

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner; he said he was starving, and could not help doing what he did - I found nothing on him but a knife.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of this charge.
JOHN LOVICK. He tried to go out; when my master asked if he had pawned a saw he said he had not - I jumped over the counter and stopped him

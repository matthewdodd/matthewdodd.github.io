            . I am an engraver
, I live in White Chapel


. I was told by my apprentice, while I was fitting in an inner room, my parlour, that somebody was going out of my shop. I followed the man that was pointed out to me, and overtook him; and upon him I found six napkins, one he had dropped: (produces, and deposes to them.) The prisoner I am positive, is the man.

            . I am apprentice to the last witness. The prisoner is the man I saw go out of the shop: I alarmed my master of it.

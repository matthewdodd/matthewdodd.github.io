            . I live at Botwell: I am a labouring man; I work for Mr. Turner. On the 10th of January, about two in the morning, I saw the prisoner in a common field take a sack with the oats in it, out of a ditch in that field: it was very moon light; I could discern his face; I seized the sack and got the prisoner home to my master; (the sack produced); it bears the mark my master's sack had.

            . I accompanied the former witness; I saw the prisoner fetch the oats out of a ditch; I know the sack to be Mr. Turner's.

            . I live with Mr. Turner: the oats were in a barn upon the morning of the 9th. Under the great door of the barn I observed somebody had made their way into the barn, and I missed a sack of oats that I was sure was in the barn the night before.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

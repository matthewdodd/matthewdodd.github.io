            , a bookseller
, of Paternoster-row


. On the 28th of June, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop alone, and saw the prisoner looking in at the window, which was open - he took a book off the shelf, which is at least two feet within the shop, put it under his coat, and made off with it; I went out - he ran very fast, but I secured him in St. Paul's church-yard, without losing sight of him, and took the book from under his coat; it is Egan's Life in London - he said nothing.(Property produced and sworn to.)

GEORGE RATHBONE. I am a turner
, and live in Witch-street, Drury-lane


. I was at ten in my parlour, which looks into my shop, I saw a broom move that stood inside the door, I went into the shop and found it was gone; I went to the door, and saw two persons walking on my right hand - I followed them, Westley was one of them - He was about twenty yards from the door; I heard the broom fall, and a man said, Westley, what have you done with the broom? I laid hold of Westley, and picked the broom up by the Olympic Theatre: I did not see them with it. The man went away, and Westley denied taking it; I told him I should take him to Bow-street, but he wanted me to take him to his father's. Fry was taken up afterwards. The prisoner, Fry, came to my shop that evening, and said that Westley was his brother; I thought he was the person whom I had seen with the boy, when he said he was not, but he had heard the boy was taken. Westley said that he had stolen the broom by the direction of a man, I believe Fry to be the man, he was dressed like him.
ROBERT CLARKE. On the 7th of December, I went out to look for Westley by his father's desire, he was brought to the watch-house for stealing the broom. I went to look after the man, I found him and took him before the magistrate; I told him that I took him for stealing the broom, and he said it was a very pretty business.
FRY'S Defence. I never knew the boy. Rathbone said he knew the boy when he came to me.

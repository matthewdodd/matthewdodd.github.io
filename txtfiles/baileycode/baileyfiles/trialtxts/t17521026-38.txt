            . I am a cobler
 in Field Lane


. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment the 31st of August; the prisoner was my servant
. She got drunk, and I wondered how she came by the money. She went away, and in about three weeks time my wife found her in the New Market, and taxed her with taking the things. At first she denied, but at last confessed taking them all away, and that she sold a parcel of them in Monmouth Street for six shillings, and one handkerchief she pawned in Shoe Lane for nine pence.
Q. Was she sober when she confessed this?
Williams. She was.
Prisoner's defence.
I deny knowing of half the things. I know of nothing but one handkerchief.  

               Guilty
            .

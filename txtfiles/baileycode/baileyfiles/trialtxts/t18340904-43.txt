            . I am servant to Mr. William Masters, a carcase-butcher
, who lives in Long-alley, Moorfields


. On the 12th of July a carcase of a lamb was hanging outside the door - a few minutes before seven o'clock there was an alarm, and the lamb was gone - I ran after the thief - I saw the prisoner with the lamb - I know it by one of the sets.

            . On the 12th of July I met the prisoner with the lamb on his shoulder, carrying it in a very awkward way - I heard some women say it was a pity no one would stop him - I followed him, and asked where he got it - he said he did not know - he then slipped it off his own shoulder on to mine, and I took it to the shop.

SURPLICE WHITWORTH
. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Benn Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Long Acre. Between one and two o'clock, on the 30th of August, I was in the shop, and was informed that we had lost a coat—I went out, looked round, and saw the prisoner running away, up the street, with something in his arms—I pursued, and overtook a policeman—I ordered him to run after him, which he did, and captured him; but he

threw the coat away—I did not see him do that, but I saw him carrying it—this is my master's coat—it was hanging over the door.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. A person could get it without coming in? A. Yes, there is a private mark upon it.
court, he threw the coat into the passage of the door-way—I took it up and then ran and took him.





JOSEPH THOMPSON
. I am a policeman. I was in Long Acre, and Whitworth told me the prisoner had stolen a coat—I saw him running up with something in his arms—I pursued him, and in running through Wild-court, he threw the coat into the passage of the door-way—I took it up and then ran and took him.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he is the person? A. Yes—I saw him do it—he had got about twenty or thirty yards before I took it up—there might be a child or a woman about, but there was no other man—I could not see his face—I am sure when I had picked up the coat, that I saw the same person running before me—because he had no tails on him coat—that is not the only reason—there was no man between me and him—he did not turn after I took up the coat—after I had brought him a short distance, he took a knife out of his pocket, and attempted to cut his on own throat, but I would not let him.

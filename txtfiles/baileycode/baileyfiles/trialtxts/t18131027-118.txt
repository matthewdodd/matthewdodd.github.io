; I was watching the off side of the carriage, I observed a person put his hand to the coach-door; I gave the alarm, and missed the coach-glass; it was a lantelet barouche. The officer came up, and asked me if I had lost a glass; I said, yes.

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Lack, in Bow-street. I saw the prisoner with his coat spread out; I judged what he had got; I seized the glass, and laid hold of him. I received a blow, I fell, and broke the glass; and by the fall my finger was broken.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the glass by the hackney coach wheels, it had no frame at all. I am innocent of thieving the glass.

            . I was in Beacham-street; on the 4th of April I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Norris' door and take the fire-irons - he ran about twenty yards, and then dropped them - I tried to stop him but could not, as I had a basket and a crow-bar in my hand.

            . I saw the prisoner take the fire-irons; I am sure he is the man - he threw them down and Mr. Burnham took them up.

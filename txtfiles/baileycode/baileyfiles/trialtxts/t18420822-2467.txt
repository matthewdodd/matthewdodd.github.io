 were indicted for

 stealing, on the

Sarah Ann Silverside and another.






JANE SILVERSIDE
. I keep a shop with my sister Sarah Ann Silverside, in Clerkenwell. On the 18th of August I saw the two prisoners near the door, and soon afterwards I saw them go away—I got up and missed two pairs of shoes—I saw the prisoners running—one of them dropped the shoes—I took them up—they are ours.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Are you sure Duncan was one of them? A. Yes.





CHARLES DENIS
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the two prisoners running—Duncan threw down these shoes—I stopped him—he said he had nothing to do with the shoes.

Price's Defence. I know nothing about them; I was not with Duncan when they were taken.

SECOND COUNT, for like offence, stating it to be the dwelling-house of 
               
                  
                     William 
                     Winter

                  WILLIAM 
                  WILLIAMS
               



            . I am a master plaisterer
. I was employed by a gentleman of the name of 
               
                  William 
                  Winter
               



            , at his house, No. 18, Cumberland-street, Portman-square, in the parish of Marybone


.
Q. Had Mr. Winter ever resided in that house - A. No; the house was in an unfinished state. I slept in the house, and 
               
                  James 
                  Charles
               



            , a joiner
 that worked in the building; we slept in the back garret. Mr. Winter put us in there to take care of the house. I kept my trunk there, it was locked, I kept the key in my pocket. I had seen the contents of the trunk on the Sunday morning before. I lost the property on Tuesday morning. The trunk contained the bank notes that are mentioned in the indictment. I lost my silver watch from another trunk, that was not locked, it was in the same room. The prisoner was a labourer
 employed by me in that house about five months; he was at work on the Tuesdaythat I lost my property. I left the house on the Tuesday at nine o'clock in the morning; the joiner and the prisoner were then in the house. I left my trunk that contained the notes and the room door locked. The prisoner I left working down below in one of the vaults, his business did not call him to be up stairs at all, and the joiner was at work in the kitchen. I left the key of the room on a shelf in the front garret, where we both put it, and I found it there when I returned.
Q. Did the prisoner know that you used to put it there - A. Not to my knowledge. I returned home about five o'clock in the afternoon, I found the garret door broken open, the trunk lock was broken open, and the contents were gone, and I missed my watch from the other trunk.
Q. Upon your discovering this, did you see the prisoner - A. No, he was gone; the joiner was in the house. I told the joiner that I had been robbed, I went to Bow-street, and gave information. The prisoner came to his work the next morning, I asked him, if he had seen any stranger in the house, or go up the staircase on Tuesday; he said, he had not. I asked him, if he was in the garret, or went up the garret stairs that day; he told me he had not. From suspicion, I had him taken up on the 24th of January. I have never recovered any of the property. There has been one note come in to the Bank; I have not got it here.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WINTER
               



            . I am building this house. I do not mean to reside there. I came to the house on the Tuesday, to look after my men, between the hours of ten and eleven. I went up stairs to go into the two-pair, I met Passmore coming down the garret stairs; I asked him, if Dudley, another workman, was in the two-pair; he seemed very much confused, which made me take notice of him, and in a faultering voice he stammered out, I do not know. I asked him, if Elijah, another workman, was upstairs; he recovered himself a little by that time, he answered me, No; then he went down. The prisoner had nothing to do at that time upstairs, nor for a great while before: he ought to have been at work below in the vault. The next morning Mr. Williams acquainted me of the robbery.
Q. (to Mr. Williams.) I forgot to ask you, whether the prisoner had the day before borrowed any money of you - A. Yes, a one pound note; he told me, that he was low in circumstances, that his wife had wrote to him for two guineas, he could not make it up, he should be obliged to me for a one pound note towards it, he would work it out. I lent him the one pound note.


                  WILLIAM 
                  GRANT
               



            . I am a taylor. On the 20th of January the prisoner came to my shop, No. 300, Oxford-street. He bought a coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of breeches; they came to three pounds four shillings. I gave him change for a five pound Bank note, I put the name he gave me upon the note. I believe it was 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Passmore
               



            . I gave him a one pound note, and the rest in silver. He asked me, if I could accommodate him with twenty pounds worth of gold for notes; I told him no. I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.


                  DAVID 
                  NEALE
               



            . I am a bricklayer. I have known the prisoner eighteen months. On the 20th of January, he came into my mother's room, where I was, No. 17, Oxford-buildings. He brought a coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of breeches. He asked my mother's leave to let them be there while he went and fetched a trunk, she gave him leave, he went and brought in a leathern trunk; he said, I will put the things into the trunk, and I will leave them here awhile, by your leave; he took the key, and went away. The trunk had his initials, T. P. upon it. He came again on the Monday, about five o'clock in the evening, and brought some more clothes: I believe, they were women's clothes. He put them into the trunk, he locked the trunk, and took the key, and away he went. On the next evening I saw him again, he had a bundle with him; he put it in the trunk, and went away. I produced the things to Mr. Williams on the same evening that the prisoner was in custody.


                  EDWARD 
                  TREDWAY
               



            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of January, in Oxford-buildings, within a door or two of the witness mother's house. I told him what I apprehended him for; he said, he knew nothing about it. I found upon him this watch. It is not the prosecutor's watch; it is a silver watch. He said, he gave fifteen shillings for the duplicate; the watch had been in pawn for two pounds. In his box were six seven-shilling pieces, thirty-six shillings in silver, and about ten shillings in halfpence. On the next day, we went with a search warrant to No. 17, where Neale lived; there we found this trunk (it has T. P. upon it), and all the articles described by the last witness; the articles consists of new mens' and womens' apparel; the whole together are worth between fifteen and twenty pounds. When I had found the things, the prisoner said to me, you old file, what can you do, there is nothing there that you can swear to.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character.

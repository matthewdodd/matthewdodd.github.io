            . I am a laundress. On the 25th of October, I was in St. John-street


, and saw a cart near Mr. Evans'; the prisoner came from the cart with a bag in his hand - he trembled, and looked back, as if to see if he was followed, I told the carter what I had seen - he was brought back.

            . I am carter to Messrs. William Sewell and Jonathan Whorley. On the 15th of October I was to deliver some goods at Mr. Evans', and among the rest a bag of pepper; I received some information from Mahony, and found the prisoner with the bag on his back,about ten yards before he got to Charter-house-square. I asked him what he had got - he said he got it from a man; I laid hold of him and the bag - in a few minutes Mr. Evans' man came - he took the pepper and I took the prisoner - it had 56 lbs. of pepper in it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going down St. John-street, and saw a man crossing the road with this bag, which he asked me to carry; I took it to go round Charter-house-square - the man who gave it me ran away.

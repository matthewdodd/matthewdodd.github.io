EDWARD ROBERTS. I am shopman to William James Stevenson, a linen-draper
, of Ratcliff-highway


. On the afternoon of the 20th of October, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some striped cotton; a piece was shown to her, at 7d. a yard - she objected to the price, and was going out - she walked rather quick; I called her back - she refused to come; in a few minutes a Policeman brought her back - he produced this cotton, which is my employer's; it had been on the counter while she was in the shop.

            . I am a Police-officer. I saw the prisoner rolling up these three pieces of print in a dirty cloth; I asked what she had there - she told me to go andmind my business - I asked her to go back to the corner of Cannon-street, and as we were going into the prosecutor's shop, she dropped these from her apron; I took them up; I am quite sure they fell from her person.(Property produced and sworn to.)

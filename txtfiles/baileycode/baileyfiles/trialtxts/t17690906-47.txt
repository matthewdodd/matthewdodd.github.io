            . I am a carpenter

                  Thomas 
                  Pickering 
               



            , a broker, in Tyburn-road. I never saw the prisoner till he was brought to me with the tools.

            . I keep a broker's shop, next door to St. Giles's church. The prisoner at the bar brought these tools to me to sell, on the 24th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, and declared he lived in Clerkenwell. I said, I must go with you to your lodgings, and if I find they are your property, I will buy them. He did not agree to go with me; then I got a warrant from Justice Welch. There he confessed he had them from a building at Hoxton


. I took them there, and the prosecutor owned them. He was then committed, and owned to several tools he had stole, which were in his lodgings, where we found them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought them of a man, but I cannot tell where, neither do I know the man. I am a carpenter
.

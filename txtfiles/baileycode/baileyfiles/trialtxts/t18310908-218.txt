            . I am servant
 to Sir William Young. On the 12th of August my watch hung on a nail in the hall about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning - the hall door was left ajar by a person who had gone out; I saw the prisoner about the middle of the hall - he had no business there; he had just come from the peg - I immediately missed the watch, and followed him - I called to him to stop; he made no answer - I followed him up the area steps; I kept close to him till he was taken - he crossed the street opposite Lady Fitzberbert's, and the watch was found down her area - I did not see it thrown down.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you keep in sight of him? A. Yes, all the way - I was eight or twelve yards from him - he might throw it down without my seeing it.

            . I saw Fuller following the prisoner, who I saw throw the watch down Lady Fitzherbert's area- it was picked up, and given to the Policeman.
Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him before? A. No - I was about three yards from him.

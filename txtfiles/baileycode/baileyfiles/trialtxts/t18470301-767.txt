ELIZA VOWELS
 was indicted

for stealing 1 saw, value 1s., the goods of 



John Vaisey; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






ANN GRANT
. I am the wife of John Grant, and live at No. 14, Little Chapel-street, Westminster—a person named Vaisey lives there. The prisoner came to his room on the 20th of Feb.—she asked if the keeper of that room was at home, I said, no, and it being Saturday night, I did not know what time he might be at home—I went on with my work—she waited about two minutes, she then took a saw off a nail, she went off, and I went after her—she did not say anything to me, but Mr. Vaisey's little boy came up and took the saw from her—he said, "You have got my father's saw"—she said, "No, I have not, it is mine; your father has got more things belonging to me"—Mr. Vaisey was down at the street-door when we got there, and the prisoner was given into custody.





JOHN VAISEY
. I live at this house, this is my saw—I know nothing of the prisoner—I have nothing of hers in my possession—I never saw her.





JAMES PHILPS
 (police-constable A 108.) I took the prisoner—she denied taking the saw.

Prisoner. I never saw the saw till I saw it at the station—I certainly never saw it—I had no recollection of it—the prosecutor knows he has seen me.





JOHN VAISEY

re-examined. I never saw her, to my knowledge, in my life—I think I got the saw from my little boy, at the street-door—the prisoner was not drunk.





WILLIAM PUCKNELL
 (police-constable B 77.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 30th of March, 1846, having been before convicted of felony: and confined six months)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On Friday evening, the 3d of April, about five minutes past nine o'clock, as I was going home to Southampton-row


, I was beyond Gray's Inn-lane, Holborn


, I felt some person drawing at my pocket, I put my hand down and found my handkerchief gone, I turned round and saw the prisoner with it, he threw it from him, I immediately took hold of him, and took the handkerchief off the spikes of the gate where he had throwed it, he said it was not him who did it; there was no person near at the time. I took him to the watch-house.
EDWARD BRITTEN. I am a patrol in Holborn, I came up at the call of watch, and took the prisoner to the watch-house. I knew the prisoner's person well.
ROBERT DAWSON. The prisoner was left, in the watch-house in my charge. This is the handkerchief.
Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is worth five shillings.
Prisoner's Defence. At the time the gentleman laid hold of me I perceived a person turn round and make his escape.
Court. Q.(to Prosecutor.) Could any person run away and make his escape upon the spot without your seeing him - A. I think it impossible.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

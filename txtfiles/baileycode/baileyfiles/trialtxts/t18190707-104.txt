            ; we live at Stepney-green


. On the 1st of June I was called up between four and five o'clock in the morning, found my shop broken open, and these things gone - the lock was forced open. The watchman had the prisoner in custody.

            . I am a watchman. About four o'clock in the morning of the 1st of June, I saw the prisoner go by the watch-house with an apron full of oranges, lemons, and nuts. I stopped him about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - he had the nut measure. He said he had been to Stepney fair to sell them; I said it looked suspicious, as they were mixed together. I locked him up. I found the prosecutor's door open, called her up, and she claimed the measure.
(Measure produced and sworn to.)

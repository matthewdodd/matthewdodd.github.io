WILLIAM RAWLINSON. I live in the Minories


, and am a linen-draper
. On the evening of the 17th of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I had a piece of lawn in the window - I was standing in the shop, a few yards from the window - I heard a noise, and found my window was broken; I am sure it was whole just before - they were large squares of plate glass, worth two guineas each - I immediately went to the door, and saw the prisoner running away; I pursued her, and took the piece of lawn away from her - it has my private mark on it; the greater part of the square was forced in, and this might have fallen out - the window must have been broken from without; I did not miss the lawn till I took hold of her, and it fell from her.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house between nine and ten o'clock, with this piece of lawn - I found nothing on her.

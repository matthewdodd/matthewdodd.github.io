            . I am a butcher
, and live at Stoke Newington


. This beef was in my shop on the 8th of April, about ten minutes before six o'clock in the evening- I saw the two prisoners walking backwards and forwards two or three times, and heard one of them say it would not do; I had seen Goulbourn before, lighting the lamps in the road; Goulbourn then came and took the heef - Newman was close by him; I was at the back of the shop; I went and took Goulbourn - Newman made off, but was taken the same evening.

            . I was in the shop. I saw the two prisoners come up together; Newman 
               drew
             the beef to the edge of the window - they then went into a public-house; I then saw one of them come and take the beef - I cannot say which.
Prisoner NEWMAN. Q. Where did you see me? A. Coming along the pavement, and you 
               drew
             the meat to the edge of the board.
Prisoner NEWMAN. This prisoner never saw me at all.

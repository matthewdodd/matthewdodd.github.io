PHILIP GODDARD. I am a carpenter
. On the 28th of May I was going up West-street, Smithfield


, about two o'clock in the morning, in my way home, and met the prisoner, who asked me for something to drink; I gave her a few halfpence, thinking I might be allowed to pass; she immediately turned round to my pocket, and took out my handkerchief and a pair of gloves, and snatched at my umbrella, but I held it fast. I seized her, and demanded my gloves and handkerchief - she denied having them, and ran across the road; I pursued and caught her - she gave me a black eye, and in an instant dropped my handkerchief; I struck her with my umbrella: the watchman came up - I gave charge of her. I found one of my gloves on the ground.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not meet me that evening in St. John-street? A. No; I did not see her till she robbed me. I was in St. John-street - she appeared quite tipsy.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling; he gave charge of her for stealing his handkerchief - she immediately struck him in the eye.
The prisoner put in a written defence stating that the prosecutor had struck her because she refused to accompany him, and denied the charge.

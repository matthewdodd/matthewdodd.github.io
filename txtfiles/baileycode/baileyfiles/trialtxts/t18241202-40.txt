GEORGE DAVY STIBBARD. On the 26th of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Bartholemew-close, coming to Smithfield


; I felt a pull at my coat; I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand - I pursued, and he threw it down at the corner of Cloth-fair - I lost it, but caught him.
Prisoner. The gentleman asked me where the handkerchief was, and I told him I did not know - Witness. I asked him, and he said he would take me back to the place; as we were going back he loitered behind for a minute; there were ten or twelve more round us, and then he denied the theft.

            . I was with the prosecutor; he turned round suddenly, and said to the prisoner, "You young rascal, you have picked my pocket." I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand; I followed, and did not lose sight of him, except for a moment when he turned. I am sure he is the boy. When he was taken he said he would take Mr. Stibbard to the place.
Prisoner's Defence. If the gentleman saw me throw the handkerchief down, what need had be to ask me where it was? and how can he tell that it was his handkerchief.
MR. STIBBARD. I felt the handkerchief going from my pocket, and saw it in his hand immediately.

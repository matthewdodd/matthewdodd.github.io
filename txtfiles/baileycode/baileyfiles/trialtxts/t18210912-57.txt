            . I live in the Westminster-road. On the 5th of September, a little past one o'clock in the morning, I was at the foot of Blackfriars-bridge


, on the London side, a gentleman said my handkerchief was gone - I felt, and missed it - I turned round, and saw the prisoner running as hard as could - I pursued, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner, and saw him throw it down in Water-street - a constable picked it up; I called Stop thief! and he was stopped without my losing-sight of him, except in turning the corner.

            . I am a constable. I joined in pursuit; I was sitting at the foot of the bridge; I lost sight of him only as he turned the corner - he threw the handkerchief down, and was secured; I searched and found a handkerchief in his hat, and a small knife and snuff box.

            (to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Price 
               



            .) What have you to say against 
               
                  William 
                  Burn 
               



            ? Where do you live?
Price. In Drury-Lane: Last Monday Morning was se'nnight when I got up I could not find my Coat, so I put on my Waistcoat and look'd about, but could not find it; I thought my Wife had mislaid it. I went out to the Door; there is a Door backward, which I found wide open; I said to my Wife, we are robb'd. I discover'd that a large Basket of Linnen, which had been look'd up for washing, was gone, and I thought it might have been done by some of our own Lodgers.
Q. Did any of the Prisoners at the Bar lodge with you?
Price. I never saw the Prisoners at the Bar, nor this young Lad, before. I went to Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



             between Nine and ten in the Morning; I likewise went up and down with a Constable to the Pawnbrokers, desiring them to stop any Linnen that might be brought; in the Interim my Wife had News brought that they had taken one concern'd in the Robbery, which was the Boy, who said the Things were left at Lowry's House, where we found some of them, and told her it was necessary she should go with us before the Colonel.
Q. What did she say to that?
Price. She said she would go with all her Heart, and told us that the other Things were at one Merrit's; but that if we did not make haste they would be gone. We left this Woman and Boy before the Colonel and went to Merrit's.
Q. Did you get Entrance there?
Price. Yes.
Q. What did you find there?
Price. We found the Prisoner at the Bar; and of the Goods we found a Piece of House-Cloth, a Coat of mine, a Coat of my Man's, and a great many other Things.
Q. Had you any Discourse with Burn or Merrit?
Price. We saw Merrit; but he got down and ran away from us.
Q. What did you do with Burn and Kipping?
Price. We took them before the Justice.
Q. Who first discover'd to you where any of your Things were?
Price. A Carpenter in Short's-Gardens.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Edward 
                  Davis 
               



            .) What have you to say against any of the Prisoners?
Davis. Please you, my Lord, 
               
                  William 
                  Burn 
               



             and I said at 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Lowry 
               



            's House last Sunday was Fortnight.
Q. What then?
Davis. In the Morning at Two o'Clock she told us it was Time for us to go out; so directly we got up, and went up Short's-Gardens, and as we went up Drury-Lane.
Q. Had you any previous Discourse about such Things?
Davis. No, my Lord; but she knew we went out a Thieving.
Q. Did Burn and you lie together?
Davis. Please you, my Lord, we lay in the same Bed with her and her Husband; when we got up we went up Drury-Lane, where we saw a Door open; so Burn said, stay, here's a Door open.
Q. Whose Door?
Davis. This Gentleman's. He went a little farther in the Entry, and pushing his Hand against the Door it open'd.
Q. Had you any body but Burn with you?
Davis. No, my Lord.
Q. When he had open'd the Door what did he do?
Davis. We went in and saw the Basket full of Cloaths, in a little Wash-house adjoining to the Parlour.
Q. Did you both go into the House?
Davis. Yes, my Lord.
Q. Then he went into the Wash-House? What then?
Davis. We took an Apron and put them all in; we went into the Parlour, there we found a Coat, a Hat, and a white Apron, and we brought them out into the Wash-House and put them into the Apron.
Q. When you got these Things what did you do with them?
Davis. We carry'd them to Katherine Lowry's House.
Q. What Time in the Morning was that?
Davis. Between Four and Five in the Morning.
Q. How long had you been acquainted with Katherine Lowry?
Davis. About a Week; and when we carry'd the Things to Lowry's, he and his Wife, and another Woman that was to have been Burn's Wife, all got up together, and they carry'd the Things to Merrit's House, all of them, except one Coat and Waistcoat, a Couple of Aprons, a Shift that she put on her Back, and a Shirt.
Court. As you all lay together I suppose she made no Difficulty of shifting herself before you?

Davis. No, my Lord.
Q. When you went to Merrit's House who did you find there?
Davis. We found Mrs. Merrit and her Husband; Mrs. Merrit would not buy any of them but the Horse-Cloth, and that she gave 7 s. for.
Q. If she did not buy them, to what Purpose was it for you to carry them there?
Davis. We expected she would have bought them ?
Q. Was the Person at home that was call'd the Husband, Merrit ? Who gave you the Money?
Davis. Mrs. Merrit herself.
Q. What Did you do with the rest of the Things?
Davis. She lent Burn a Crown to give to me for my Share of the Things, and made me spend 2 s. of it.
Q. Did you mention to Lowry or Merrit how you came by these Things?
Davis. Lowry ask'd me where we took them from, and I said Drury-Lane.
Q. When was it you gave an Account of this?
Davis. When I was taken, last Monday se'nnight.
Court. Then you was taken the very Day?
Davis. Yes, my Lord, there was a Gentleman in a red Cap, a Carpenter, saw us go by and go into 
               
                  Katherine 
                  Lowry 
               



            's, by that Means I was taken; then I discover'd all at the Constable's House.
Q. Was you before Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



             when Burn was brought there?
Davis. Yes, my Lord.
Q. Do you remember any thing that he said before Sir Thomas?
Davis. I remember he said he would confess nothing at all.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Wapshot, Constable.) Where did you find these Things?
Wapshot. At Lowry's House; a Sack full of them upon the Stair-Case and some in the Chamber; I found Burn in the Cock-lost; I dare swear he won't deny it.
Q. When you found him there what did you do with him?
Wapshot. I carry'd him and Merrit before Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



            .
Q. Did either of them say any thing to this Fact?
Wapshot. Merrit said he did not know how the Things came into the House.
Q. Have you any thing more to say? Did Burn say any thing to Sir Thomas?
Wapshot. No, my Lord; he had hardly any thing to say for himself.

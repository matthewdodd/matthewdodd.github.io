                  Mason 
               



            . On the 27th of May, as I was in an inner Room, I heard my Wife cry out Murder, and heard her cry out hold him, Tough, which was the Dog that ran after him, and held him; after he was brought into the Shop, he said if I would go after two Persons that were his Companions, I should find the Shoes. I think he said one 
               
                  Betty 
                  Smallman 
               



             had them, and one Williams was concern'd with him in stealing of them; but not finding these Persons, I carried him to the Watch-house, and the next Morning I says to my Neighbours, I'll go down and hear what this Fellow has to say; so I goes into the Hole of the Watch-house, and call'd up Henry Stephens, and I said, where, and who , are those Persons concern'd with you last Night, and Stephens said that Williams was concern'd with him.
Court. Are these your Pumps?
Mason. Yes, Sir.
Q. How long after the 27th of May did you find them again?
Mason. On the 28th, he said that they had sold them to a Woman in Drury-lane, but she was ignorant of the Affair, so she gave them to me again.
Q. to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Mason 
               



            . Do you know 
               
                  Henry 
                  Stephens 
               



            ?
Mason. I sto od at the upper End of the Shop, and I saw 
               
                  Henry 
                  Stephens 
               



             coming in as if he were a Customer; when he came forwards he pull'd the Shoes out of the House by main force. I cry'd out Murder, Stop Thief; and the Dog ran after him, and, I said, Hold him, Tough . The Dog caught hold of his Wig, and tore it to pieces, and I caught hold of his Arm, and this Shoe was in his Hand; he had artfully convey'd the other away. He told us there was another Boy stood at the Window, and receiv'd them of him, as he stole them; and he says, that he took them one by one.
Court. Then you saw him take one Shoe out of the Shop?
Mason. I did, Sir.
The Prisoner had nothing to the Purpose to say for himself.



               Guilty
            .
The Court would have been glad to have seen Eliz. Smallman , who had been mentioned once or twice before on these Occasions.

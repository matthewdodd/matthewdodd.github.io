            . I have a stand at the Thistle and Crown in Piccadilly




. I missed a paste breast-buckle out of my glass-case on the 26th of June, I had cleaned it about four o'clock that afternoon; the prisoner was out of place, and he lodged at the Thistle and Crown. I suspected him, and charged him with taking it; he confessed he had taken and pawned it at the corner of George's-court; he went with me there, where it was produced; I missed other things which are not laid in the indictment, and he confessed he he had taken and sold as many as fetched him 1 l. 14 s.

            . I am servant to Mr. Murthwaite, a pawnbroker, at the corner of George's-court, Princess-street, near Leicester-fields; the prisoner came and said he wanted to buy a shirt-buckle; I shewed him a good many; he said there was none that he liked; then he shew'd me this, and said it cost him 7 s. saying it was very difficult to get into his shirt, and he wanted to change it: I bought it of him for 4 s. (produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I did take it and carry it to Mr. Fleming; I came from Manilla, and have been in England three years.

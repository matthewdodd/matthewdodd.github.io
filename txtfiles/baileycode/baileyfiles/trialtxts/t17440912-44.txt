            . I live at the Six Canns in Holborn, the Prisoner was my servant
 six months, and behaved very decently; she went from me to lodge in a bad house (one Bannister's who is under sentence of transportation) which I believe was the cause of her ruin. I employed her afterwards as a chairwoman, and missing things at several times, I found her out, and she owned the taking them. I found one pint pot at Mr. Wigley's.

            . I am a Pewterer. The Prisoner brought a pint pot to me, and owned before the Justice that she robbed the Prosecutor of those things. 


               Guilty 10 d.

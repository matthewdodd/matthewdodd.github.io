            . I live at Woolen-house, Glocestershire. On the 17th of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Oxford-street


, and had nine sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and a half-crown, in my purse, which was in my coat pocket. A person called out that my pocket was picked - I felt, and missed it. I had seen the prisoner close behind me just before - I looked round, and a person said he was in custody. I found him so, with my purse in his hand.

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner about five minutes before this, and watched him - he went close to Mr. Goodrich; I saw him put his hand into his pocket; he then ran across the road into a public-house. I followed and took the purse out of his hand.
(Purse produced and sworn to.)

            . Aged 23.

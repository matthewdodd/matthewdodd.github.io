EMMA DRIVER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 pair of stockings, value 6 1/2 d., the goods of

ALBERT MOORE
. I am shopman to Mary Ann Howse, of Whitechapel. On the 16th of March the prisoner and another girl came for tome black flowers, and as they were going out I saw the prisoner take a pair of stock-ings off some cambric at the door—I overtook her—I said, "Where are the stockings?" she said she had none, but as I took her back they dropped from her at the door.

Prisoner. The other girl took them, not me. Witness. I am sure the prisoner took them.





RICHARD THORPE
 (police-constable R 155.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

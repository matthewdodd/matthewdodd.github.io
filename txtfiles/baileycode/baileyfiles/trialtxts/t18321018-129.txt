            . I am the wife of John Parkes - we live in Perry-street, Somers'-town


. The prisoner came to lodge with us, with her mother, and paid 3s. 6d. a week; they moved in on the 3rd; I received one week's rent - I went into the room three times; when I went in the third time the woman was very tipsy, and the man she had lived with was gone, and all his working-tools -I then missed these articles, and said, "What have you done with the things?" she said, "They are all right;" I called in an officer, and he took her.

             (Police-constable L 155.) On the 19th of September I was called in; the prisoner was given into my charge - I took her to the station, and found on her eight duplicates, three of which relate to this property.

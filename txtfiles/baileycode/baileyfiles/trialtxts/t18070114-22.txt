            . I live at No. 308, High Holborn



. I am a linnen draper
.
Q. What parish is your house in. - A. St. Andrew's



.
Q. Do you remember on the 6th of this month any of the prisoners coming into your shop. - A. Yes. about four in the afternoon, it may be a few minutes before or after, I cannot say.
Q. Which of them was it that came into your shop. - 
               A. Mary Crawley
            , I can swear to her.
Mr. Walford. Did you see her come in. - A. Yes,

                  Ann 
                  Bolton
               



             I think came in with her, but I was engaged with the customers in the shop, and not seeing her face, I cannot swear to her, she had her back to me. At the time that she came in, the prisoners at the bar did not ask for any thing, and while I was at the bottom of the shop, my apprentice was in the accompting house, directing a newspaper for the country. I begged him to come forward, to wait upon three customers that came in; during the time that I was giving change for two dollars to take six shillings, the prisoner dropped some halfpence.
Q. The prisoner at the bar is, I suppose, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Crawley
               



            , and the woman who came in with her. - A. Yes, I heard the prisoner ask my young man to shew her some gingham, which I suppose is the woman, but I cannot say which. I heard 
               
                  Ann 
                  Bolton
               



             make him an offer of sixteen pence for.
Q. You heard the woman. - A. Yes, which he refused to take. The girl went out of the shop first, and the woman followed; the woman did not go out of the shop quite, but returned, said will you take sixteen pence for the gingham; my young man said he could not take sixteen pence, it cost eighteen, which he asked for it. In about a minute afterwards she went away. In about ten minutes afterwards a gentleman came down with the prisoners 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Smith

                  Crawley
               



            .
Q. Come down where. - A. In about ten minutes afterwards he brought them into the shop,

                  Smith
               



             with the child in her arms, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Crawley
               



            ; in his hand he had a piece of gingham.
Q. Have you got that piece of gingham. - A. Yes.
Q. What did you do with that piece of gingham. - A. He left it with me, and I put it a one side; he asked me when he came in whether I knew that piece of gingham, which piece of gingham was on my counter not ten minutes before the prisoners was there; my young man made an observation that it was necessary to put it on the shelf, as we were rather shorthanded. On my observing to the prisoner 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Smith
               



            , that I should send her across the water, she fell upon her knees and begged for mercy; she and the prisoner Crawley begged for mercy.
Q. What became of the piece of gingham. - A. I took the gingham myself to the magistrate in the evening.

Q. Elizabeth Smith
             had she been in your shop or house before she was brought back by this gentleman. - A. No.

             I produce the property.

Q. What is the value of that. - A. The value of it is forty shillings.
Q. Is that the selling price. - A. No, it cost me more than that, but I value it at forty shillings, there are twenty four yards.
Jury. Will you be so good as to shew the mark. - A. It is usual when we cut out a pattern to cut it out of a fag; the gingham was bought in a very large lot. At the moment the gentleman brought it in I recognised the gingham.
Q. Did you ask the gentleman his name. - A. No, I do not know the gentleman's name.
Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.
Q. What persons were in your shop besides yourself when they came in. - A. None at all but myself.
Q. Where was your apprentice standing. - A. In the accompting house. I have a square in my accompting house to see through into the shop, that when I am in there I can see what is going forward in the shop.
Q. It was dusk at the time that you attended the shop. - A. Merely so.
Q. What makes you speak to Crawley, it being dusk. - A. It was not so dusk but I could see the prisoners, and Bolton's dress was so remarkable.
Q. What was remarkable in her dress. - A. She had on a kind of a fawn coloured bonnet, and she had it on when she was brought back to the shop.
Q. You cannot speak to her face. - A. I cannot swear to her face, I know her from her dress, she had on a dark green gown with a check apron, and a fawn coloured bonnet.
Q. Smith was not in your shop at all. - A. No, she was not till she was brought there.

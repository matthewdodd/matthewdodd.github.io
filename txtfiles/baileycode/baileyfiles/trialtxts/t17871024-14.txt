I am a goldsmith



; my mother and two sisters are my partners; I live at No. 43, in the Minories


; on Wednesday, the 17th of October, as we were at breakfast, between nine and ten, in the back parlour, we received an alarm that the shew glass was cut; there was a cry of stop thief; when I examined the glass, I found there was one pair of silver shoe-buckles, and two odd silver shoe buckles taken out; they were brought back by a neighbour, Mr. Taylor; they were the two odd buckles; my brother has had them in his possession ever since till this time. (The pair of buckles, and two odd buckles produced.) I do not know who brought the pair of buckles.
How do you know these odd buckles? - Here are the fellows to them.
How do you know the pair? - Because we had two pair of them, and here is the other pair; we had but two pair of that pattern.

             sworn.
I am a watchman in Whitechapel parish; I was coming along with a quarter of beef on my back, and I saw three boys hovering about the silversmith's shop; I went and left my beef, and came back, and there were several people assembled about the door; the one that made his escape, cut the glass with a diamond, and the other two, the prisoners at the bar, shoved in the glass with their hands, and went away; then they returned, and put their hands in, and took out these buckles; I saw Williams and Carroll have buckles in each of their hands, but could not tell what quantity they had; I and another person called out stop thief! and pursued them down Swan-street, and they were stopped by a gentleman; then we took them, and brought them to Mrs. Harding's.

             sworn.
I am a glazier; I saw the prisoners run down Swan-street, and Carroll threw his shoes off; I suspected him to be the thief; I took him, and found a pair of shoe buckles under his left arm, and I gave them to Mr. Harding, brother to Miss Harding.
- COLLINS sworn.
I am a porter; I was coming down the Minories, and saw a boy cutting the shew glass; I went in, and informed Mr. Harding that the glass was cut; immediately the cry of stop thief was heard, and before I got up to them, they were taken.
Mr. HARDING sworn.
Upon the information of the last witness, I went out, and pursued the two prisoners, but before I could get to them, they were taken, and brought back to my sister's shop; Mr. Taylor went to Mr. Young's, and begged he would give him those buckles, that were thrown down in his area by the prisoner Carroll.
Court to Hazell. Did both the prisoners run one way? - Yes, for some distance; Williams and Carroll passed by Mr. Young'shouse, and somebody saw the buckles in Mr. Young's area.

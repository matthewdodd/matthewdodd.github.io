            . I am warehouseman to the procutors; they are wholesale linen merchants
, in the City. The prisoner has been for the last twelve months employed as their porter
. We have a warehouse on the basement. While I was in the privy on the day in the indictment, the prisoner came down to the basement story, and took the two pieces of dowlas up stairs. I watched him to see what he did with them, and he wrapped them up, and put them into the cart, which was at the door, and with which he was going out. He drove the cart away, and I went down into the warehouse, where I missed the two pieces of dowlas. Upon this, I followed the cart; I followed it to Fore street; the prisoner was with it. I toldhim he had two pieces of linen dowlas he ought not to have; he said it was the first time he did such a thing, and it should be the last. I told him to bring it back, which he did.

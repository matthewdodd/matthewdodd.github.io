             the lad lived servant
 with me some time.
Q. How old is he?
Scott. He is about 16 years of age. I sent him to look for pots, he did not return at all. I sent my servant after him, who saw my two plates, and a brass candlestick in his room: I went and found them in a box. I took the boy before the justice, there he confess'd he took away these things for his father's use. and that he had caus'd him to take a copper sauce-pan which I had missed, and that it was pawn'd in Wild-street; I went to the pawnbroker, and found it accordingly. The goods produced in Court, and deposed to. The father was taken up, he confessed he had the saucepan to beat out a bruise, and the boy said his father ordered him to take these things from me.

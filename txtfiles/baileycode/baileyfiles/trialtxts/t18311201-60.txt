            . I live in Cooper-street, City-road


, and am a parish constable. On the morning of the 20th of November I saw the prisoner and Cooper standing near a wall, where there had been a fire a month or two back, at a wadding manufactory - a man on the other side of the wall lifted something over, and the prisoner stooped down and took these articles on his head; I followed, and took him - he said he hoped I would let him go; I said I could not - I called for assistance - the other man got away.

            . I live in Cooper-street, and am a turner. I saw the basket of iron on the pavement - theprisoner begged forgiveness, and said he would go on his bended knees to obtain it; I had worked on those premises - I know these doors, and this spanner and cap; they had belonged to the steam-engine there.

            . I was engineer on these premises - they belonged to Mr. John Henry Taylor, and this iron is his property; these doors belonged to the steam-engine, this box to the piston, and this cap to the fly-wheel- the premises are quite unprotected.

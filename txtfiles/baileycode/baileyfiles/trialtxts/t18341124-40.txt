ANN POWELL
. I am the wife of John Powell, of Wellington-street, Goswell-street. On the 22nd of October, about a quarter past eleven, a boy came into our shop and took a purse which contained this money, out of the till—I saw him take his hand from over the counter, with the purse in it—he ran out of the shop—I followed him—the prisoner stood outside, and I saw the boy give the purse to him—they ran different ways—I called out, and the prisoner was brought back by the police officer and Carty—this is the purse which they brought back—one of the shillings in it was marked—this is it—the officer is very ill, but another officer has brought the purse.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the street—a lad threw down this bag—I took it up, and the officer said I had stolen it.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

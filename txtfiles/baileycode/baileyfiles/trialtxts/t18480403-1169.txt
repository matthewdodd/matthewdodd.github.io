MESSRS. BODKIN and CLERK
conducted the Prosecution.






PETER CHARTRES.
 I am a shoemaker at Camberwell; it is my dwelling-house. On 13th March, about twenty-five minutes to one o'clock, some persons came to my shop—I had shut it up—they forced the bar and broke the shutters and windows—about 113 pairs of shoes and boots were taken away, worth 15l. or 16l.—I could not identify any of the persons—they had weapons in their hands, I cannot say what—there were between 200 and 300 persons.





WILLIAM PARKER.
 I was a special constable. Male was given into my charge in Southmpton-street, about a quarter before one o'clock—the crowd was then dispersing—they were near Mr. Chartres', which is in the same street as Mr. Jameson's—I accompanied Male to the station—the officer found on him this small pair of shoes.





BENJAMIN HATFIELD.
 I live at 1 and 2, Southampton-street, perhaps a quarter of a mile from Mr. Jameson's. A great number of persons came up to my house, from a quarter to half-past twelve o'clock, with staves and pieces of wood—I saw Male taking part with the crowd.





CHARLES AUGUSTUS CATHIE.
 I followed Taylor—he threw some shoes over the wall—I chased him a mile—I nearly caught him—I saw him drop these two shoes in Brunswick-terrace—I gave them to the officer—I saw him give something to a man, which I believe was a candlestick.





PETER CHARTRES

re-examined. These shoes are mine, and are a part of what were taken from my shop that day.

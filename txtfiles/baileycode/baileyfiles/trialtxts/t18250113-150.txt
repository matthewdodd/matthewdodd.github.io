            . I am a comb-maker, and live at Aldgate. On the 15th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was coming to town, and saw the prisoner running before me - he went up Duke-street, Aldgate, with a parcel of books in his apron. I saw Mrs. Cockburne come out and look about; she said she had lost some books. I went down Mitre-street, and caught the prisoner at the corner of Gravel-lane, with the books in his apron.

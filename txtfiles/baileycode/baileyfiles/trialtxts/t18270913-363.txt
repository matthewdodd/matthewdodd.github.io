RICHARD WATSON. I am a painter
, and live in Gower-street, Bedford-square. On the 3d of September, between three and four o'clock, I was in Smithfield


, and was going to Raymond-buildings; the officer came and told me I had lost my snuff-box from my coat pocket. I had not felt any snatch - I turned round, and saw the prisoner close to me - I saw this snuff-box fall from the bottom of his trousers.

            . I am an officer. I was going through Bartholomew fair, and saw the prisoner in company with another person; the other took the snuff-box, and the prisoner received it. I saw them go and take it, facing Mr. Richardson's show - it was taken from the gentleman's left hand pocket - the prisoner put it into his trousers pocket, and it fell through to the bottom of the trousers.(Property produced and sworn to.)

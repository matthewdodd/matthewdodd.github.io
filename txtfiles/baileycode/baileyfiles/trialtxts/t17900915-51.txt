             sworn.
I am in partnership with 
               
                  John
                   Knowles
               



            ; we are brandy and wine merchants

, in Bishopsgate-street


. The prisoner came into my service on the 22d of May. My partner lives next door to me; there are two distinct houses, but they are supported out of the joint stock; the house-keeping and maid servants are distinct, and the occupation also. The prisoner staid with me till the first of July: on the first of July, in the night, or morning of the second, she was gone; when I came down stairs the porters, who sleep in the garret, were in the shop; they said, they had lost their money: the prisoner's bed was made, and one fold of the window shutter in the front room was open, and one window shutter in the kitchen was open, for the purpose of letting in light I suppose: my sister missed the things in the indictment belonging to her; the money was the property of my partnerand myself, what the men had collected for small bills the day before: some wearing apparel of my sister's was found on the prisoner when she was taken.

                   SMITH
               



             sworn.
I am sister to the last witness. I left home the evening of the night when the girl went away; I returned in a month; I missed two muslin aprons, an Irish cloth apron, a stuff petticoat, a pair of pockets, a muslin handkerchief, and a cloth shift; I saw her when she was taken, and she had my stuff petticoat and Irish cloth apron on her: the shift was found at the pawnbroker's by a duplicate she had in her pocket.
(The things deposed to.)
Prisoner. I wish to have the porters examined separate.

             sworn.
I am a porter belonging to this house; I lodged in the garret; my fellow-servant, 
               
                  William
                   Thomas
               



            , lodged with me; I was at home that night; we went to bed at half past ten; I had three guineas, and five or six shillings in silver; the gold was my master's, that I had received that day; I awaked about half past six; my fellow servant was down first; he had been at the door; he asked for the girl; I had not seen her; he said the door was on the latch; I missed the three guineas and the silver; I apprehended this young woman afterwards; I never found the money, or any thing; I found the prisoner in Lincoln's-Inn, about five or six weeks after; my fellow servant went to bed last; my breeches were by my bed-side; my door was not locked, but on a spring bolt, and the key on the outside.


                  WILLIAM
                   THOMAS
               



             sworn.
I am a porter at this house; I slept in the garret with the last witness; I went to bed at half past ten; I fastened the door; a spring lock, and the key the outside; I got up about half past six; I went to the street door first; the chain was undone; the door unbolted, and the lock put back, and the door was on the latch; the prisoner was a servant; she was gone; after a little while I missed my money, six guineas and a half in gold, and thirteen shillings in silver, of my masters, Messrs. Smith and Knowles, and some silver and halfpence of my own; I understood my master was the last person up.
Smith. I came in about half after eleven, and the prisoner let me in; I fastened the door myself; all was safe, and also the windows, which I found open in the morning.

             sworn.
The prisoner brought a shift to pledge, the 23d of July, for 1 s. 3 d. at No. 15, Ayre-street, Leather-lane.

                  THOMAS
                   SAPWELL
               



             sworn.
I am the officer; I took the prisoner with a petticoat and apron on, and this duplicate of the shift in her pocket.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I submit to your Lordship, on this indictment, the prisoner is entitled to be acquitted as to the capital part of the charge; it is proved to be the single dwelling-house of Smith, the witness; there is no communication between the houses, though the funds of the partnership may contribute to both the houses.
The Court granted the objection.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
The things I bought and paid for; the reason I left my master's service, was, there was no woman in the house but myself, and the two men were always taking great liberties with me, and I did not like to stay any longer.
The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.

Not of the burglary.




               Transported seven years

Tried by the London Jury before the Lord CHIEF BARON.

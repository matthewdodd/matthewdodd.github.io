            .
ELIZABETH BORTON. I get my bread by the wash-tub. I lost my things on the 22nd of July; I live in a kitchen, 12, Brook-street, Fitzroy-square


. I lost ten shirts; I was out about ten minutes, about half past eight in the morning, I went out my work; I left my husband's breakfast at the are, and a loaf and butter in the cupboard for him to get his breakfast. I came back at half after nine; I asked my husband if he had breakfasted; he said, no. There was nothing for him to eat; I looked in the cupboard; the loaf and butter was gone. I missed my shirts; a child said, a man had been in my room; he said, he came with something to be washed. Mr. Crocker has got my things.

            . I am an officer. From information, I pursued the prisoner; I found him in the New-road, with a bundle at his back; I took him back to Mrs. Borton; she claimed the property in the bundle. I secured him. This shirt I took off the prisoner; he had put on a clean shirt out of the the bundle, and put this dirty one in it.

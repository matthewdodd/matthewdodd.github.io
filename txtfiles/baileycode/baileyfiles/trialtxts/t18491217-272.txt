JOSEPH LINTHWAITE
. On 11th Dec, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop, 7, Crown-row, Walworth-road, and asked me to show them some black silk handkerchiefs, about 3s. 6d.—I showed them some, they were not good enough—I showed them some better ones—they said they would take one at 5s., but wished me to take something less—I could not—Cunningham said she could not take it then, but would bring her husband at dinner-time, and would I allow her to pay 6d. off—she gave me It., and I gave her 6d. change—as soon as they left I missed a piece, containing two or three handkerchiefs, this is one of them (produced)—I know it by the private mark.





HENRY HUNT
 (policeman, M 82). On 11th Dec. I took Harriss, on another charge—as I took her to the station she dropped this piece of silk.

Harriss's Defence. I bought it in Rosemary-lane.

Cunningham's Defence. I left 6d. on it, and intended to go back in the afternoon; but a few friends came in, and I could not go.





ROBERT BRANFORD
 (policeman, M 12). I produce a certificate—(read—Eliza Harriss, convicted July, 1847, of stealing a pair of boots, having been then before convicted)—Harriss is the woman—this is the fifth time she has been here.

             sworn.
I am servant
 to Mr. Waller, at Watford. On Sunday, the 24th of June, I came to town with two horses and a saddle horse; I went to Mr. Thomas's, the Green Man, at Paddington


, and put my horses up, and went to bed at eleven o'clock; and in the morning I found somebody had been in the room, and I got up; I missed my purse, containing a guinea and a half, two half crowns, and two shillings, and a pocket handkerchief out of my waistcoat pocket; my waistcoat was on the bed, and my breeches under the pillow that my head lay on. I got up, and waked Mr. Thomas between five and six in the morning; Mr. Thomas has the property. The prisonerslept below stairs; I went into his room with the landlord, and the prisoner pulled the money out from under the bed upon the sacking, and put it on a table. I asked him if he had my handkerchief? he said, he knew nothing about it. I examined the bed, and shook the handkerchief out of the pillow-case.
Was all the money that you lost in the purse when found? - Exactly the same. I gave these things to Mr. Thomas; he has kept them since.
Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had you known the prisoner? - He lived at Otterspool a year before.
You was friends with him? - Yes.
You used to joke together? - No.
You had not got tipsy this day? - No.
Not a little? - No.
Did not you acknowledge in the morning that you did not think he meant to rob you, and that you would take your money, and would be contented? - No.
Did not you say so? - I do not recollect.
Should you have prosecuted him if Thomas had not forced you, and insisted on your prosecuting him? - Thomas did not insist.
Who had him taken up? - Mr. Thomas.
Did not Thomas insist that you should prosecute him? - Never.
How long had you known the prisoner? - Three quarters of a year.
Court. Did the prisoner know you was in the house? - He spoke to me in the evening, and asked me how I did; that was all that passed.

             sworn.
I keep the Green Man at Paddington; Lovatt informed me, about five in the morning, that he had been robbed, and I searched the servants' apartments, and found nobody had been out; I went into the prisoner's room, and he was in bed; I asked him if he had not slept up stairs? he said, no; (I understood he was to have slept up stairs the night before.) I went up into the room where the postboy slept, and brought a little cane down, and asked him if it was his? he said, yes; I pulled him out of bed, and I believe struck him; he begged for mercy, and said he had done wrong, and would give up the property; he searched his pockets, but could not find it, and then he went to the bed, and brought the purse out from under the bed, and laid it on the table. The prosecutor said, there was a handkerchief; the prisoner said, he knew nothing of it. The prosecutor took up the pillow-case, and shook it out.
Mr. Knowlys. You was very angry? - Yes, I was.
The postboy was not so angry? - No, Sir, he did not seem so.
The postboy was willing to go, and take no more notice of it? - He was.
You thought it was right to prosecute him? - Yes, I told him to prosecute him.
(The property produced, and deposed to.)
Court to Lovatt. What was your reason for not wishing to prosecute? - I did not understand the law.
Prisoner. He took two shillings out of my pocket.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I found this purse, and took charge of it till the morning, and was threatened to have my brains knocked out. Lovatt said he was satisfied. Thomas said, you fool, we will prosecute him. The postboy went away to Watford, and Mr. Thomas went to fetch him to prosecute me.

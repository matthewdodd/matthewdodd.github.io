                  , from his person
            .
JAMES RITCHIE. I am a merchant
, and live at Guernsey. On the 15th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street


, going towards St. Paul's, and perceived some person take hold of my coat - I turned round and laid hold of the prisoner Clark; I saw my handkerchief drop from the hand of Phillips, who was close by him; the street-keeper came up and took him. I am certain they were in company - I had a friend with me who assisted.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a constable. I was coming down Fleet-street, and followed the prisoners, who were in company; I saw Phillips put his hand into the gentleman's pocket - Clark was behind; I did not exactly see the handkerchief taken as two gentlemen were before me, Mr. Ritchie seized Clark, who halloned out "Oh, my leg;" I laid hold of him and Mr. Ritchie's friend brought Phillips to the watch-house.
PHILLIPS'S Defence. I was going to Smithfield, where I work, when the gentleman laid hold of us - another gentleman picked the handkerchief up.

CLARK's Defence. I had just left my mother, and was going over the water - I could not pass the gentleman on one side, I tried to pass on the other, and he laid hold of me.

            . Aged 12.
CLARK - 

               GUILTY

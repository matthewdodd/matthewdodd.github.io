                  , from his person
            .
WILLIAM TAYLOR NOYES. I am employed in a counting-house
. On the 10th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the City-road


, with a gentleman, and perceived the prisoner close behind me; I turned round, and he crossed the road. I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone; I ran, and found it on him.

            . I am a patrol, and received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. All I can say is, I saw it fall from the gentleman's pocket - it did not belong to me, but I took it up, and crossed over the way. I was in distress at the time.

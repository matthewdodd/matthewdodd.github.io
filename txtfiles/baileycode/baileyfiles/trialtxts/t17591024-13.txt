            . I live in Ratcliff Highway


, and am a Broker
; last Thursday in the afternoon, between 3 and 4 o'clock, we had at my door 31 pewter plates, 6 pewter dishes, and a pair of bellows. While my boy and I were in the yard backwards, a neighbour came in and ask'd me, if I had sold a parcel of pewter? and said, a woman was just gone from the door with some. I looked and found they were taken away. I and my boy ran and stopp'd the woman at the bar with them, about a dozen or 14 doors from my shop; produc'd in court and deposed to.

            . My husband keeps a broker's shop near the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner go away from his door with this pewter; I gave him notice of it, and he ran and stopp'd her with it upon her in the street.

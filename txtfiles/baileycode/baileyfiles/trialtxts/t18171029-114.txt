            , who is a painter
, and lives in Mansel-street


. On the 14th of October, the things were in a chest in my bed-room, which was up two pair of stairs. I was in the kitchen between eleven and twelve o'clock, and thought I heard some person - I listened, and heard the noise again. I opened the kitchen-door, and saw the prisoner on the ground-floor; I asked him what business he had up my stairs? he said he had not been up my stairs. At that moment he let a waistcoat fall. I collared him, and he let the rest of the things fall in the passage. A gentleman came in, hearing me call - He secured him.

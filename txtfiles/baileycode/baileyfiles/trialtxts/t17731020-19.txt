            . I live in Great Portland-street, Marybone


: I am a victualler
; the prisoner was my servant
; she went to draw some beer, and called to me to tap it lower because it ran soul; I went down and left the till locked and the key in it; when I came up, my little-girl informed me she heard the prisoner at the till; I missed the money and charged her with it; she said she had no money but two-pence halfpenny; this was about two minutes after I missed the money; I desired her to satisfy me whether she had the money or no; she then said she had two shillings which one Mrs. Parker had given her; I enquired of Mrs. Parker, and she said she had given her two shillings; there were five shillings and sixpence found upon her, and a piece of foreign coin that I had by me four or five years, fourteen halfpence, and four-pence halfpenny in farthings; I am positive to the foreign piece and nothing else. I found the stockings under the bed; (the stockings produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I took her up and carried her before a magistrate.

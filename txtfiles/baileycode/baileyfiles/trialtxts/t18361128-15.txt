SUSAN ELSAM
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of October, 2 tippets, value 2l. 10s.; and 1 cap, value 4s.; the goods of 



Samuel John Grotteck, her master.






SAMUEL JOHN GROTTECK
. I am a furrier, and live in Wood-street. The prisoner was employed by me as an errand girl for about three months—on Saturday, the 29th of October, I observed a lady's squirrel tippet on the cellar stairs—I took it away, and put another in its place, which I marked "S. J. G."—I set a man to watch who would come to take it away—it is worth about 3l. 10s.—I did not mark the one I removed—it has been sold since.





SAMUEL HICKLING
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On Saturday, the 29th of October, I was concealed in the shop, and saw the prisoner there alone—she could not see me—after she had been in the shop a short time, I saw her take a chinchilla tippet off the counter, and put it into her pocket—and a few minutes afterwards she went to the cellar-head, stooped down, took the squirrel cape, and put it under her clothes—an officer was sent for, and the property was found on her.





THOMAS M'LELLAN
. I am an officer. I was sent for—the prisoner was up stairs—her mistress put her hand up under her clothes and pulled

out this cape, and the other I saw taken from her pocket—I went to her mother's, and found in a box this cap which the prosecutor identifies.
(Property produced and sworn to.) J (William Lewis, a weaver, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 13.—Recommended to mercy.





Transported for Seven Years.—(Penitentiary.)

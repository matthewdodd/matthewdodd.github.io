It appear'd, that Martin Peter Tanner was an Errand Boy
 to the Prosecutor, who keeps a Toy-shop
 , and that by his own Confession he had taken sundry Goods, at several times, from his Master, and given them to his Mother and Sister; and upon searching his Mother's House, they found several Toys, &c. which were produc'd in Court, and the prosecutor swore they were his Goods; the Fact appearing plain, the Jury found the Boy 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.
             and his Mother Sarah Turner 


               to the Value of 10 d.

                   LLOYD
               



             sworn.
On Sunday se'night about half past eight I came home from a chapel that I always go to, and news was brought me that some of my lead was stolen; accordingly I went to the Cross-keys, in Bulstrode-mews



, for there is a coach-maker's shop belonging to me, which I was going to cover with lead, and I found a piece of lead in the public-house.
Was there anything by which you could know that lead? - Very well, because there had been three pieces of lead in the shop, which weighed two hundred and a half; the coach-maker's man is here, that locked the door.

                   ENGLISH
               



             sworn.
On Saturday in the afternoon, Oldfield came to the shop, and abused his father very much, who was at work there, in slating; I reprimanded him for so doing, and he came into the loft, and staid sometime, he then went up another ladder to another different part of the loft, and took a survey of the roofs all round, he staid up about a quarter of an hour, and came down, and I saw him no more then.
Where was the lead laying? - In the loft, right by where I worked; after taking a survey of the premises, and going up to the roof a second time, he came down and went off; he did not take anything away with him then, I am positive; I shut up shop after that, the door was locked by the apprentice; and on the Monday morning, we watched for him, at a muffin maker's, in Barret's-court, his name was Wilmot; when we got a search warrant, we went up stairs, and found the prisoner Oldfield there, and the lead over in a loft; there was a woman the wife of the prisoner, Hugh Cooper rents the room, here is a piece of the lead.
Do you know whose lead that is? - I cannot say, it was cut to pieces.
Lloyd. I am confident it was my piece of lead, there have been four pieces originally, each of these pieces was fourteen inches wide, and sixteen feet and a half long, all the four pieces were cut out of one sheet, and all alike, one was put in this place, the other three were taken away.

                   NEWSON
               



             sworn.
I am constable of the parish, and I apprehended Oldfield in Cooper's apartments, and we found the lead hid over a sort of a cockloft; we took it down, and took the prisoner to the Rotation-office; Cooper was out, and he came in before I went away with Oldfield; I took Oldfield, I had no warrant against Cooper, but he went to clear himself, and was committed from the Rotation-office; he and his wife both went, and they proved their marriage, otherwise they would both have been committed.
What did Cooper say about it? - He said he knew nothing at all about it, I know nothing to the contrary.

                   HODGSON
               



             sworn.
I was going down to the stable about half after seven, and I met Oldfield, I asked him what he had, says I, have not you lead there? no, says he, let me go; says I you shall not go this time, I caught hold of him, and he flung down the lead and ran away; this is part of the lead, it was weighed the next morning, and it weighed about five score and five pounds.
Lloyd. There were four pieces in all, three were round, two at

                   Cooper
               



            's apartment, and one piece this last witness detected him with; these two pieces that were found at Cooper's were cut into twelve pieces, I put them twelve pieces together, and they all matched.
What length did they make amongst them? - They made just two pieces of sixteen feet six inches and a half over, they had not the half-inch originally; the piece that was dropped by the stables was not tried by me or by any witness here.
Court to English. The piece of lead that you produced was one of the twelve pieces? - It was.
Court to Lloyd. From this circumstance you believe the lead to be your's? - I have not a doubt about it.
PRISONER OLDFIELD'S DEFENCE.
I went on Sunday evening into the Mews, by the Cross-Keys, I found this lead and I picked it up on a dunghill, I took one of the pieces and brought it on my shoulder to 
               
                  Hugh
                   Cooper
               



            's house, and I came back for the other piece, and I met this gentleman, and he said he would have it, I told him I found it, he went to take it off and it tumbled down.
Court. Do you know of any connection between the two prisoners? - No.
The Prisoner Cooper called one witness, who gave him a good character.

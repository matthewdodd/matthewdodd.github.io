            . I am servant to Joseph Read, who is a cloth-worker
, and lives at Pentonville


. On the 16th of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Leary came to the door with some rushes to mend chairs with, and asked for Mr. Johnson. I told him I did not know such a person. I shut the door, and took notice of him. I saw him leaning against the parlour window. About twelve o'clock I missed the box. The parlour window was open. There is a long garden in front of the house.

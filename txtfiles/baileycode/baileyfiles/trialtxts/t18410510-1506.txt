ROBERT FRANCE
. I am a soldier in the artillery. On the evening of the 25th of April I was in a public-house at Woolwich, about eight o'clock—the prisoner came in, and I gave her a glass of gin—I was then going to my barracks—she came after me, and asked me to go to her room with her—I went there—she put her arms round my waist, and I found her hand in my pocket—I lost a half-sovereign and 2s. 6d.—I had it in my pocket as I went up to the room, and no one could have taken it but her—I came out and found a policeman—the prisoner could not be found for some time—I found her in the public-house again, and gave her into custody.





PHILLIP PALMER
 (police-constable R 79.) I took the prisoner into custody about eleven o'clock at night.

Prisoner. I did not have it—he was in several other girls' company before he was in mine.





ROBERT FRANCE

re-examined. Q. In what manner had you spent the day? A. had a brother come down to see me—I left the barracks at three o'clock with him—at six be went on board a vessel to go to London—I had drunk a little, but was quite sober.

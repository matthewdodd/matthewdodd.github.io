            . On the 18th of March I lost a silver watch from my back workshop; I had seen it perhaps half an hour before, when I called in my apprentice-boy to his dinner, it was hanging there, and in about half an hour it was gone; the prisoner (who was my servant
) left me that day, and I did not see him again till the 17th of June.
FRANCIS BROWN. I took the prisoner on the 17th of June; he said he took the watch and pawned it at Mr. Sowerby's - I found it there.
JOHN BURBIDGE. I am in the service of Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker. I have a watch, pawned by a man, on the 18th of March, but I do not know the person.(Property produced and sworn to.)

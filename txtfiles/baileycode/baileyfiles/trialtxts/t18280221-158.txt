GEORGE ROGERS. I am a tobacconist
, and live in St. Giles's. The prisoner was in my employ; it was a part of his duty to deliver goods - he had 42 lbs. of tobacco, and 17 lbs. of snuff to deliver to customers at Kensington, and other places - he went away, and I heard no more of him for three weeks - on the day after Christmas, I received this letter, which is his writing: -
"SIR, December 26th, 1827.
I write this to inform you, that I met with a young man on Monday last, when I was going to deliver your goods; I had unfortunately drank rather too freely, and was not aware of the time being so late, I sat down to take rest and fell asleep; when I awoke, my bag was gone, and I did not like to return; but I hope you will forgive, GEORGE ROOTSEY."

                  MERIDITH
               



            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. I sent the prisoner out with several parcels, in a bag, to deliver to different persons.
Prisoner's Defence. I got into a public-house, at Knights-bridge, and was afraid to return home.

            , on the 24th of May
.
Mr. Deards thus depos'd. The Prisoner had been my Servant
 between Two or Three Months, and I had no mistrust of him; but Yesterday he offer'd a Ring to sale at a Shop, and one of my Workmen happening to come to that Shop at the same Time, he took Notice of it, and gave me Information: When the Prisoner came Home, I examin'd him, and he confess'd that he took it. I searched him, and found this Penknife, and Tortoise-Shell Snuff-Box in his Pocket, and this Cane was found at a Chandler's-Shop, where he had left it; but he told me that he bought it in St. Paul's Church-Yard, for 7 s.
The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he found the Ring and the Snuff-box, at the Shop-door, after he had been sweeping the Shop; the Penknife, he said, his Mistress lent him to cut some Cords with; and the Cane he only took out to walk with. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

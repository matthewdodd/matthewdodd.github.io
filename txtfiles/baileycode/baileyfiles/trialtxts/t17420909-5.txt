             . I have two Houses, one in Golden and the other in French-Alley


, which last was the House that was broke open. I was acquainted with it about four or five in the Morning, and went there and found the out side Window open, and the Wall likewise broke. The Prisoner at the Bar has but an indifferent Character.

            . I did not lie in that House that was broke open that Night, but I shut it up about ten o'Clock at Night, locked it, and took the Key away to my Master's other House; the People were all in Bed, and the Windows fast shut. I went there between six and seven in the Morning, and the Shutters next the Street were broke, and the Things laid in the Indictment were all missing. - The Prisoner frequently came to fetch Things from our Bakehouse.

            . The 20th of July last, the Prisoner came to my Shop to be shaved; after I had shaved him, I took the Wig out of the Box, to comb it out, and casting my Eye into the Work, I found it was the Wig I had made for

             proved to be her Work, and knew by its being made of two Sorts of Cloth.

            . This Wig is mine, I lost it the 16th of May last; the Prisoner said he bought the Wig in Rag-Fair, and if he had stole it he would not have worn it.

            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in the Quadrant, Regent-street. The prisoner was my errand-boy
, and received money when he took out goods; he was to give it me when he returned; he did not keep any book: on the 7th of June, I sent him to Mr. Burns, No. 14, Montague-place, to receive 1l. 8s. for goods sent the day before - he came back and said, the lady would call and discharge the bill; I then sent him to another place, and he did not return.

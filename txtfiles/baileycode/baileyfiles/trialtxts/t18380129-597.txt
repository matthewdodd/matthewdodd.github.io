THOMAS BRANNEN
 was indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






DENNIS CRONIN
. I am a surgeon. Mr. Campbell supplied me with wine—on the 17th of November, I remember the prisoner calling on me with a message from Mr. Campbell, the wine-merchant, in Mark-lane—he told me Mr. Campbell would be obliged by my letting him have half-a-dozen bottles—I said certainly, he might have as many as he wanted—in consequence of that, I called my servant, and desired her to let him have what he wanted; and I said, "Give my compliments to Mr. Campbell, and tell him I will pay him his bill in a short time."

Prisoner. I did not tell him I came from anybody. Witness. Yes, he did, and he came the next morning and said Mr. Campbell would feel obliged by my letting him have a few more, which I also let him have.





MATILDA SOPHIA STEWART
. I received directions from my master, and gave the prisoner two dozen bottles and three—the next day I let him have a dozen and three more, after he saw my master.





PETER FREDERICK AUGUSTUS CAMPBELL
. I am a wine-merchant in Mark-lane. The prisoner left me two years ago—I did not direct him in November to go to Mr. Cronin—I received no bottles from him.

Prisoner. I did not ask for the bottles in Mr. Campbell's name—the servant told me she was glad to get rid of them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

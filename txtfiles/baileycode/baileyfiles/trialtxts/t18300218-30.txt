. On the 19th of January the prisoner came and brought a trifle-dish to match - I said we had not one like it; she then asked the price of a pair of salts - I went to ask Mrs. Larard, and while I was gone I saw the prisoner put something into her lap; Mrs. Larard went, and spoke to her - she was then going away; I went, and asked what she had in her apron - she said what she had was her own; I had seen her before.

            . Fish called me, and I spoke to the prisoner when she was going away; he asked what she had in her apron - she said what she had was her own; I took these articles from her, which are my husband's.
Prisoner's Defence. I went to match a trifle-dish, and what he showed me was too large - I then looked at a pair of salts, and he did not know the price; his mistress came out, and asked 5s. for them - I bade her 4s., and she would not take it; I was then going out.

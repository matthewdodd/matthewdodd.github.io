 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of May, 3/4 lb. weight of leather, value 1s., the goods of

JAMES CROSSLEY
. I am the son of Henry Crossley, a currier, in Church-street, Deptford. On the 13th of May, the prisoner came and purchased some leather—my father was serving him, he had occasion to torn his back to serve another customer, and I saw the prisoner put this piece of leather into the basket which he had—he left the shop—I followed and gave him into custody of the policeman, who found the leather in his basket.

Cross-examined by
MR. PATHS. Q. Was he sober? A. Yes; he did not seem as if he had been drinking—I was at the back of the desk—I was in such a situation that I could see well, I was about fife yards from him—my father went out of the shop into the adjoining room—it is a long shop—when the leather was found be offered to pay for it—it was worth 1s.





GEORGE GOOD
 (police-constable R 114.) I took the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Did he appear to be sober? A. Yes, quite.





WILLIAM SMITH
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I was present at the trial—he is the person—he had three months imprisonment.




GUILTY
. Aged 44.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

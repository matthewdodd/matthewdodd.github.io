            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 3rd of October I took some prisoners to Clerkenwell prison; the prisoner and the prosecutor were both there - the prosecutor said he had lost his watch: I searched the prisoner, and found it on him - he abused me very much, and doubted my authority to search him; I found the watch, chain, and seals in his fob - he said it was his own, and dared me to take it from him; I asked the prosecutor to give me a description of it, which he did most minutely - this is it; the prisoner was going there for three months.
Prisoner. The officer was intoxicated.

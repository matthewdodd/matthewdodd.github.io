            . I am apprentice
 to Mr. Hamilton, a printer, in Falcon-court, Fleet-street


: the prisoner had worked there. About seven in the morning of the 18th of October I left the prisoner in a room where my coat hung while I went into another room; when I returned I missed both the prisoner and my coat; I left no one in the room but him.
The apprentice to a pawnbroker in Cursitor-street produced the coat, which he deposed he received in pawn of the prisoner on the 13th of October, a little after seven in the morning. The prosecutor deposed that the coat produced was his property.
The prisoner, in his defence, said he pawned the coat at the request of a man he met in the street.

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street, and live in Castle-street, Oxford-street. On the 22nd of April, at six o'clock in the evening, I was returning home across Smithfield


, and saw the prisoner in company with another about twenty years old, and just in the middle of Smithfield I saw two gentlemen in black coming from Holborn - they were close behind the gentlemen, who are unknown to me; knowing the other I watched, and just as the gentlemen got into the open part of Smithfield I saw the prisoner draw a yellow handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, who seemed unconscious of it - the prisoner turned to the right and the other to the left; he stowed the handkerchief into his breast - I let him cross the market; he then turned back and met me by Long-lane - I laid hold of him, and saw Lock find the handkerchief in his hat; the gentlemen were gone away.

            . Wilks gave the prisoner into my charge, and said, in his hearing, that I should find the handkerchief on him - I found it in his hat; he had 1s. 6d., a bad dollar, and a handkerchief of his own.
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

            . I live in Cloth-Fair; the prisoner was employed by me. Last Whitsun-Tuesday I had some business at Hackney, Clapton, and Hummerton; he came and ask'd me, if I had any business for him: I gave him a waistcoat, that was shrunk in the dying; and two pieces to let it out on the sides; and on the Wednesday evening, I missed the pieces mentioned in the indictment; I went and took him in bed; I charg'd him with taking the things; he own'd to me, he had taken them; that he had pawn'd the black piece to Mr Brown, on Snow-hill, for 4 s. and that he had sold the other pieces, at the back of St Clement's church, for 5 s. and 6 d. he went to the place with me, where I found them; produc'd in Court; the knit piece may be like another, so that I can't swear to that, but I know the other pieces to be my property; I cut them out myself.
Q. What are the four pieces of cloth worth?
Pool. I would give eight shillings myself, for four such pieces.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

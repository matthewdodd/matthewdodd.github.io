            , Manchester warehousman
, King-street, Cheapside. About a quarter to nine o'clock in the morning I was in the warehouse - I saw nobodycome in, but saw the prisoner going out with this cotton cord under his arm - I called to him, and asked where he was going - he ran out; I saw him turn into Mr. Mosey's warehouse, next door. I went in after him, and found the cord thrown down behind a truss - he said he knew nothing about it, and ran out, but was secured.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met a man dealing in old clothes - he told me to go in and bring out the cord, and he would give me some halfpence: it was so heavy I went into the next house, and laid it down. I ran out to see for him.

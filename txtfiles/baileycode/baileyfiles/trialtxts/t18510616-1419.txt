ROBERT CHERRY
 and 




WILLIAM EDWARDS
, 

stealing 1 purse, value 6d.; 2 sovereigns, 2 half-crowns, and 1 florin; the property of 



Charles Mankelow, from the person of 



Louisa Mankelow: Cherry having been before convicted.






LOUISA MANKELOW
. My husband's name is Charles. On 4th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I was walking along the Lower Marsh, and saw the prisoners and another one—as Cherry passed me I saw my purse in his hand—I laid hold of him—he turned round, dropped the purse on my bosom, and said, "For God's sake let me go!" and he got away from me—they were all close together, and Edwards said, "Run like hell!"—he was very rude to me, and I gave him in charge—this is the purse (produced)—it is mine, and had 2l., two half-crowns, and a florin in it—I had it in my pocket a quarter of an hour before I saw it in Cherry's hand.





WILLIAM WESTON
 (policeman, L 65). I saw the prisoners and another one walking along the Marsh—I watched them, saw a crowd, and saw Cherry running away—I went towards the crowd, and saw Edwards run away—I spoke to the prosecutrix, went after the prisoners, and saw all three together—they saw me, and ran away—I took Edwards, told him what I wanted him for, and he denied all knowledge of it, and said the boy that had done it had run away.


Cherry's Defence. I picked the purse off the ground, and was looking at it, when the lady passed me, and said it was hers.

Edwards's Defence. The lady told me to stop Cherry, and said I told him to run; I asked her to let me go; she would not, and I ran away, and was taken twenty minutes afterwards.





HSNRY HOUGHAM
 (policeman, L 159). I produce a certificate—(read—Surrey Sessions, March, 1850; Robert Cherry, convicted of stealing money from the person; confined three months)—Cherry is the boy.

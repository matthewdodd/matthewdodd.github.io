            . As I was coming towards the city, on Sunday evening, I overtook Mr. Greenfield. I saw the prisoner put his left hand in the prosecutor's right hand pocket, and draw his handkerchief partly out of the pocket, but seeing I observed him, he desisted; but I followed him as far as Aldgate; there I saw him take it out of the pocket, and I believe he shuffled it away to his companion who was with him.

They searched me but could not find any handkerchief upon me.

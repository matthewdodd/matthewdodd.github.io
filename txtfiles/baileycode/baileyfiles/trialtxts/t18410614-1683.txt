1683. 




HENRY SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of May, 2 yards of carpet, value 5s., the goods of 



Jemima Moore; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JEMIMA MOORE
. I am a widow, keeping a broker's shop in Upper Seymour-street. The prisoner was about my shop for an hour or more on the 26th of May—I suspected him, and took in a hearth-rug—there

was a piece of carpet on a table outside—I saw the prisoner take the carpet—I ran after him, and held him till a person came to my assistance, and he was brought back with it under his arm—this carpet now produced is mine.

Prisoner. I am innocent of taking it from any furniture—I took it from the pavement—when she came to me I said, "You can have it if it is yours,"





WILLIAM ROBINSON
 (police-constable N 266.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a servant
 to Mr. Nobbs in the Strand; on the 5th of November, Mr. Betts, gentleman that lives at Newport-Pagnel, informed me he had directed a box to Mr. Seagood in Well and Bucket court in Old-street, and that he had been at Newgate to see the Prisoner, who is the convict 
               
                  John 
                  Massey 
               



            , and that he asked him if he was guilty of the fact, he said he was; and that in the possession of his mother, the prisoner 
               
                  Anne 
                  Massey 
               



            , there were some notes and other effects, which Mr. Nobbs should never be the better for; upon this information there was a search-warrant obtained to search the house of the prisoner 
               
                  Anne 
                  Massey 
               



             in Red-lion passage, by Red-lion square. Mr. Welch, Mr. Gee, and I went to search; this was on the 5th of November, between two and three in the afternoon, Mr. Welch asked for Mrs. Massey, the daughter, that is the other prisoner, made answer her mother was not at home; he said, she must come and shew him her brother's box, which, she said, was in the garret; she took us all up, and shewed us the box, it was empty; then Mr. Welch asked her to see the things that were in it, she uncovered the bedstead and shewed us a parcel of cloaths, but not the things we went in search of; there was another box, which was the prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Massey 
               



            's, she gave us the keys, we searched it there, I found a bag which seemed to me to be cash. I asked her whose property that was; she said it was her mother's and her's. Mr. Gee, who was present, called Mr. Welch, who was gone into another room.
Q. Did you find any thing else beside money ?
G. Holland. Yes, in another box I found a 60 l. bank note.
Q. Was all this found in the mother's house?
G. Holland. It was her sister's house.
Q. Did you find any more?
G. Holland. Yes, a banker's note for twenty five guineas.
Q. Did you find any goods and chattels?
G. Holland. Not then, we carried them before Mr. Fielding; I went with them. Mr. Fielding asked 
               
                  Anne 
                  Massey 
               



             for the spoons and rings; she denied them. The daughter was brought in and examined afterwards. She said she took them out of her brother's box by her mother's order; there were some medals. Mr. Gee and I went back again, and took the mother with us. She then called for a younger daughter, which the aunt said was gone out. She was fetched in, and the prisoner, 
               
                  Anne 
                  Massey 
               



            , her mother, said, You must fetch the spoons and rings. I went down with her into the cellar; she gave me a bag, which contained the spoons, rings, and medals mentioned in the indictment; there were fourteen spoons, eight tea-spoons, and six large ones, seven gold rings, and several silver medals; they were concealed under a board in a kind of a dust hole. Mr. Gee took an account of them, and they were sealed up. I have them here. The 60 l. bank note is my property. (He produces them.)


                  Anne 
                  Mallery 
               



            . (She is shewn the goods) All these spoons are mine; they have all the crest upon them.
Q. Are these the spoons that this 
               
                  John 
                  Massey 
               



             was convicted for stealing?
A. Mallery. They are the same; these are the medals and these are the rings.
Mr. Welch. Upon the 5th of November last I received an information from Mr. Nobbs, that a box was directed to town to Mr. Massey, that he had reason to believe it was lodged at his mother's house. I went with him to Mr. Fielding, and took out a warrant to search the mother's lodgings, which I did with Mr. Holland. I was down in another room with the sister of the prisoner 
               
                  Anne 
                  Massey 
               



            . At the time Mr. Holland found the money, I was called up, and Mr. Holland shewed me the money. I asked the Girl whose property that money was; she told me it was her mother's. I expostulated with her yery much, and told her the circumstance of the five-guinea piece. Mr. Holland searched farther, and found a 60 l. note and the twenty-five-guinea note; then she confessed these were a part of the things taken out of her brother's box, and that it was taken out by her mother's direction, and put into her box. Here is a letter; I am not positive whether I took it out of her box or out of her pocket; it is a letter from 
               
                  John 
                  Massey 
               



             to Mrs. Seagood. (It is shewn to Holland.)
G. Holland. This is 
               
                  John 
                  Massey 
               



            's hand-writing.
Read to this purport.
' Loving aunt,
' I pray for God's sake you will be so good as ' to take my things in when they come, if it is ' but for an hour or two, till my sister can fetch ' them away, and not turn them back again. I ' pray, for Christ's sake you will, for my life is ' depending in it; for if they are discovered before ' I am tried, I shall be hanged, which, madam, ' I hope you will have pity upon my ' youth, and be so good as to take them in for ' an hour or two, and it will be no damage to ' you, for my sister shall fetch them away before ' night. No more from
' your dutiful, though ' unfortunate nephew, '

            .'
Directed to Mrs. Seagood, Well and Bucket court facing St. Luke's church, in Old-street.
I took the daughter into custody, and directed Mr. Gee to stay till the mother came home, and bring her to Mr. Fielding, which was done; when the mother came, she denied knowing any thing about the spoons and rings, and seemed in a great agony of mind, and desired she might be hanged with her son, or words to that purpose; she was in a great consternation.
Q. Had you heard about the spoons and ring at that time ?
G. Holland. We did not know whether they were in that house or not, but as the other things were found, it was reasonable to suppose these were concealed somewhere; the mother, as I said before, denied the knowledge of the rings, and it came out from the daughter, she was in another room; they were examined separate. When Mary was sent for to be examined, she said, they were in the lodging of her mother. I did not go the second time to search.
Q. to Holland. Did you hear the mother declare at any time, of her knowing any thing in relation to these goods?
G. Holland. When before Mr. Fielding, she said her daughter took them out of her son's box by her command.
Q. What did she take out?
G. Holland. The plate, the cash, and the notes.

                  Gee 
               



            . I went back to the house the second time with the mother; as I was carrying her to gaol, she desired the younger daughter to fetch the rings and the spoons up stairs; Mr. Holland went down with her, and they brought them up. (He is shewn the rings and the spoons.) These are the things; there is a Nag's Head crest upon them.

            's Defence.
What could I do with them when they were brought to me?
Mary's Defence.
To my knowledge I did not know what was in the box till it was opened. I knew not that any thing was in it but cloaths. We have witnesses to call to prove when we received the things.


                  Richard 
                  Murrall 
               



            . I am a book-keeper to the carrier these goods came up by, the Rose and Crown in St. John's street. On the 30th of October, there came up a sack and a pair of boots, directed for Robert, or Mr. Massey, I cannot say which, there came two or three women for the goods, and asked for them in the name of Seagood.
Q. Are the prisoners the persons?
R. Murrall. I cannot be sure. I told them there were none; they came again in the evening, and not asking for them in the name they were directed, I would not let them have them. I sent them in the morning as directed; they were directed to Mr. Massey at Mr. Seagood's. I sent them to Seagood's in Old-street, and I had two shillings brought me back for the carriage; that is all I know.

            . Mary the daughter lived as a servant with me between three and four years ago, and I have known the mother about as long, and I never knew but she was a very honest woman before this happened.


                  William 
                  Burroughs 
               



            . I have lived a great many years within a door or two of them. I never heard but they were very honest before this thing happened.

                  Hilton 
               



            . I have known the prisoners about three Years; they were very honest as far as ever I saw.

                  Edstone 
               



            . I live the door facing them, and have done this three years; I never knew but they were very honest just people, I never heard any thing to the contrary.

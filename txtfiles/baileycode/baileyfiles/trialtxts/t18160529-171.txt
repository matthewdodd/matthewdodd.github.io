            . I am a baker
. I was in Bond-street


 on the 20th of May, at about two o'clock; I left my barrow to go and serve a customer, and when I returned, there was an officer standing by the barrow, and he told me, he had a man in custody for stealing bread from my barrow.

            . I saw the prisoner leaning on a post close by the barrow, and knowing him, I watched him. At last I saw him take a bag from under his coat, and put five half quartern loaves into it. I took him into custody.

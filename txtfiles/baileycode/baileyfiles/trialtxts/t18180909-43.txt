NORTH NAYLOR SAVERY. I am in the East India House. On the 22d of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Redcross-street


, the prisoner ran against me as he passed - I felt something at my pocket - He crossed the street, and held a handkerchief on his left side, which I suspected to be mine; he turned into a court, I followed him, he quickened his pace, and turned round another court. I called Stop thief! he was stopped at the end of the court, within a hundred yards of where I lost it; my handkerchief was produced.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I know it was my handkerchief.

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Paul's-alley, Cripplegate. I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Savery following him, he was the only person running from the cry. I joined in pursuit up Jacob's Well-passage - He was stopped; I came up and secured him; in a moment a person brought the handkerchief, and said he picked it up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I deny it; the handkerchief which I had was mine.

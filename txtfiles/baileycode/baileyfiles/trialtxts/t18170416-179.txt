SECOND COUNT, The same, only stating them to be the property of

                  Stevens
               



            .
JOSEPH STEVENS. I am engineer to the East London Water Works Company

, and had the care of their coals. On the 6th of April, at seven o'clock in the morning, I received information of the robbery-the coals which were taken from the prisoners, are the property of the Company.

            . I am the Company's watchman. On the 6th of April, between three and four o'clock, I heard a noise among the coals, and saw three men at the barge-two of them were in the barge, and the other in the boat alongside. I called out, and they got into the boat, and rowed down the river. I went into the barge, and found a white frost on the coals, but not all over them; there was a place without the frost-about three sacks of coals had been taken from that part. I went as far as Bow-bridge, but could not find them.

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live at Bow. I gave my watchman orders to watch, and let me know when the prisoners went out. On the 6th of April, about three o'clock in the morning, he came to me, and said, they were gone out. I saw them a few minutes after they were taken, and asked them how they came by the coals. They said they were given to them - They had between three and four sacks, in five bags and three baskets - They appeared to be of the same quality as the coals in the barge.

            . I am a watchman. Mr. Nunn told me to watch the prisoners. I saw them go out, with bags, on the 6th of April, at a little before three o'clock in the morning; they went by land towards the place where the coals are kept - They came back at half-past four o'clock. Wilds and Spicer had each a bag of coals-Kentish was standing by the boat, and three bags and three baskets of coals standing by him - He went out with the other prisoners - I secured them - They said the coalswere given to them.


                  JOHN

            . I am a constable. I asked the prisoners how they came by the coals - They said they were given to them - I asked them why they went about stealing in this way; they said it was the overseers fault, because they had not relieved them.

            . I am a trunk-maker
, and live in Noell-street


. On Monday the 22d of October, about eight o'clock at night, I went to my workshop, I then left it for about a quarter of an hour; I returned, and just before I came to the shop I saw a man at the shop door, with something under his arm. I went up and asked who he was; he said "It is me;" I said I insist upon knowing what you have under your arm. He made no answer. It was the prisoner who was my servant. I immediately called for a light, which was brought. I insisted on knowing what he had, he pointed down and said, "That is it;" it was the skin which he had under his arm, it then laid at his feet, he had brought it from the workshop. I gave him in charge, went to his lodging, and found one skin, some handles, and other things.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I took the light down, the prisoner pointed to the skin.
Prisoner's Defence. I kicked my foot against the skin and took it up. Mr. Wyer said "What had you in your hands," I said "Nothing," which was wrong. As to the handles, my wife repairs trunks for him, and they are off old trunks.

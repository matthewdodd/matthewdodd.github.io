            . On the 3rd of August I left my watch in my sister's room, No. 12, Gee's-court


, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - I returned between seven and eight in the evening; I then missed it - I had seen the prisoner at the door when I went out in the morning - I saw the watch afterwards at the office; I am certain this is it - it was my brother's.
Prisoner. Q. Had not I a right to be at the door? A. I cannot say; I had been but two days there - I saw you and another boy.

            . I am a pawnbroker. This watch was pawned with me by the prisoner, on the 3rd of August, between one and two o'clock.
Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the door, and a young man came and said, "Will you earn 1s.?" I said Yes; he said, "Pawn this watch;" I said, "Why do you not do it yourself?" he said he did not like to go in.

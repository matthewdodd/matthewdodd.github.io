, on my way home to Islington, about six o'clock in the evening - I felt a slight jerk at my pocket; I turned, and saw a man who told me my pocket had been picked of a silk handkerchief - I put my hand to my pocket, and missed it; the prisoner was taken.

            . I saw the prosecutor walking across the fields, and the prisoner and another walking behind him; I saw the other take the handkerchief, and give it to the prisoner - I told the prosecutor, and I saw the prisoner taken; I am sure he is the person.

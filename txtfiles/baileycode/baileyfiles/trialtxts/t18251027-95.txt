. The prisoner was in my service for about a week - on the 23d of October my wife saw a piece of satin fall from the prisoner's dress; the other articles stated in the indictment were found in her box, which was corded up in the kitchen; she was going away that day, and had wished to go on the evening before. She opened her box herself after being repeatedly desired to do so.

            . I live opposite the prosecutor's shop. On the 4th of November, some time after four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner and another lad near the prosecutor's door; I watched them, and saw the other lad, who seemed older than the prisoner, take the boots from the side of the door - he did not go into the shop; he gave them to the prisoner, who had been close by when he took them - the prisoner walked away, and the other followed him; I gave an alarm, and saw them taken; they had not gone far from the house.

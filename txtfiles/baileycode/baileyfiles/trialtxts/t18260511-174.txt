            . I am an officer. I was in Cheapside, and saw the prosecutor, and the two prisoners close behind him - they were together. I saw Westover take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and throw it behind, to Abell, who caught it - it did not fall down - he put it under his jacket; I ran over and took him - my brother took the other.

            . I saw the two prisoners behind this gentleman, and saw Abell tuck the handkerchief under his jacket - I crossed, took hold of him, and he dropped it.
WESTOVER's Defence. I was going along Cheapside, and picked it up; when this gentleman came I dropped it.

             thus depos'd. I keep a Chandlers Shop, and now and then sell a Dram, for which the Prisoner was sometimes a Customer; I went out and left my Daughter in the Shop, and the Watch hanging in a little Room behind. When I came back the Prisoner was Smoaking a Pipe by the Fire side to the Shop. I went into my back Room, pull'd off my Hoop and my Apron, which I threw in the Cradle, and so leaving the Door open and the Watch in the Room, I stept into the Yard, and when I returned, the Prisoner was yet sitting by the Fire side, but she presently went away, and in about half an Hour I mist the Watch. When I afterwards apprehended her, she had my Apron on, I took notice of it, and she answer'd, this is all that I have of yours about me. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

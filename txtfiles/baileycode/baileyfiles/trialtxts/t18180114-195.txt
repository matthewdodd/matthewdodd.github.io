            . I was at the Theatre, in Tottenham-street, Tottenham-court-road


, on the 16th of December, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner stood my side in the gallery; I caught his hand in my pocket, I took it out, and accused him with picking my pocket-he denied it. I sent for an officer, who searched him, and found the articles stated in the indictment, upon him, which I had lost, and a letter.

1433. 




ANNE COLEMAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of May, 1 gown, value 27s., the goods of 



James Henry Williamson.






JOHN FREDERICK TATE
. Mr. Williamson is a pawnbroker, and lives in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. On the 29th of May, I saw the prisoner take down this gown from inside his door—I cannot say whether it was pinned or not—she put it in front of her, and went down the street—she turned down a court—I told the people of it, and she was brought back in a few minutes—I know she is the person.

Prisoner, Q, Can you say you saw me take the gown down? A. Yes I could not come and take you; I had my own shop to attend to.





JOHN HOOPER SANSUM
. I live in Brick-lane, opposite the prosecutor. On the 29th of May, Tate told me to go down the street after a woman who had stolen a gown—I went, and saw the prisoner in a court—she was stooping—I thought she was tying her shoe—she said, "Little boy, do you want to go past?"—I said, "Yes"—I went past, and stood in front of her—I saw she was putting this gown under her petticoats—I said What do you want with that gown?"—she threw it down, and said "D—n the gown, take it"—I said, "No; you must go back"—she said

she would not; but another witness came up, and she went back—she said she would break all the b—y windows.





THEOFHILUS LIEBRECHT
. I am in the service of Mr. James Henry Williamson. I went down the street, and saw Sansum, who had hold of the prisoner—she hesitated to come back—I said I would get an officer—she came back, but said she should have been a b—y fool to have seen it lay, and not to pick it up.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

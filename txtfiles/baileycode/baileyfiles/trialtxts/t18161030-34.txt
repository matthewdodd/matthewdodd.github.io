            . The prisoner was a servant
 of mine. On the 9th of August, she staid away in the evening, and we had a great suspicion of her. In consequence of that, we went to the watchhouse to get an officer. She came the next morning at six o'clock for her thing. I told her to come between eight and nine, and she should have them. She did not come until the evening. I then sent for a constable, and had her things searched, and the articles in the indictment were found among them; there were pen knives, scissors, and different kinds of cutlery, which were my property; altogether there were things to the amount of ten or fifteen pounds; but I can't say that they were all taken at once.

. On the 16th of January, at a quarter-past five o'clock, I was in the parlour; on looking into the shop, I saw the prisoner on his knees, in the act of taking this money out of the till; it was in a bowl- I took him with it; I had seen it safe two minutes before then - there was 1l. 19s. altogether; he gave it me out of his own hand - he was on his knees inside the counter.

             sworn.
I am a butcher; opposite Great Garden-street, Whitechapel, about fifty or sixty yards from Mr. Exeter's, on Wednesday the 6th of February, I saw two men stealing some beef from my stall; the prisoner was one, I followed him for a mile and a quarter, he was never out of my sight, I took him with this hammer-cloth under his arm.
(The cloth produced in Court, and deposed to by Taylor.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going a voyage, and came ashore to buy some things I wanted; I met with a young fellow I had known two years before, he took me up to Whitechapel, and asked me to carry this cloth for him, when Scott took me.
The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

               Transported for seven years

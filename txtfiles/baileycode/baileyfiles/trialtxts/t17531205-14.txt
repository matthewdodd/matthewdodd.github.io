; the prisoner lodged with me; I missed the sheets off his bed, and charged him with taking them, he confessed he had; I took him before the justice, where he confessed the same, and where he had pawned them. The justice ordered a warrant, and we went and found them. [The sheets produced in court by 
               
                  Nicholas 
                  Middleton 
               



             a pawnbroker, who deposed he received them of the prisoner at the bar; the prosecutor deposed to the sheets as his property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was out of work, and have several small children, and having no money pawned them in hopes soon to have money to redeem them again.

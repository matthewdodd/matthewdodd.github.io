            . On the 4th of December. I saw the prisoner in Dean-street, she asked me to treat her with some gin; I walked down Dean-street into St. Ann's-court


; she run away from me; I felt my watch go from me. I said to the other woman that my watch was gone; I catched the prisoner. I was persuaded to put her in the watchhouse. I went home with the other woman to her lodgings in Smart's-buildings.
Q. How long were you with the prisoner - A. About a quarter of an hour. I felt my watch in my fob when I was with the prisoner; when she run away I missed it.
JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am a watchman. Cragnell desired me to take the prisoner into custody; I took her to the watchhouse. I saw the prisoner take the watch out of her pocket, and put it on the ground.

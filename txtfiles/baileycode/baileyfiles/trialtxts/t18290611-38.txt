. I had some fowls about my yard the day before the 12th of May, and they were safe at breakfast time that morning: while I was at work that day, Mr. Hesse came and told me that he saw a person enticing the fowl under a gate - we went to the place; I told a person to watch him; Mr. Hesse afterwards brought me the prisoner, with one fowl, which I knew to be mine.

            . I was at work in the middle of the ground with the prosecutor - Mr. Hesse came and said he saw a man enticing the fowls; I ran down to the place- Cater told me to go and see what that man was doing; I got over a bank, and saw the prisoner throw this cock from under his coat - he was then taken.
BENJAMIN HESSE. I saw the prisoner enticing the fowls through the gate; I gave information to Cater, and be pursued him; I am sure he is the person I saw take the fowl, and put under his jacket.

CHRISTIANA DOUGLAS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of August, 1 seal, value 3l.; the goods of the Hon. 




Thomas Cecil, commonly called Lord Thomas Cecil.






JANE FRENCH
. 1 am housemaid to Lord Thomas Cecil. On the 31st August, about twenty minutes past two, the prisoner came to his house in Eden-place—she said 6he came from Lady Charlemont for a card of Mrs. Russell's, and asked if Lady Sophia Cecil was in town—I said she was not—she then said I was to speak to the housemaid for the card—I said there was not a card—she wished me to look—I went into the dining-room, she fol-lowed me—I went to the table drawer to look—she came up to the table—I said there was not any there—the door-bell rang, the footman came to the door—I said perhaps he could tell her where Mrs. Russell's address was-the prisoner went away, and I then missed a coral seal, which I had seen just before she came—no one could have taken it but her—it was on the table in the dining-room—the prisoner was by that table—I have never seen the seal since.





JOHN PORTER
. I am footman to Lord Thomas Cecil. On the 31st Aug., at half-past twelve o'clock, the prisoner came, and stated she came

from Lady Charlemont with her compliments to Lady Sophia Cecil, and she would be glad if she could give her Mrs. Russell's address; and if she was out of town, she would be glad if the housemaid would look out the card.





SARAH SCOTT
. I am in the service of Lady Charlemont. The prisoner was not in her service—I know nothing of her—Lady Cbarlemont was not in town on the 31st of Aug.—she had been out of town three weeks.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to ask for a letter for the hospital; I did not go for a card; I asked if I might go to Lady Charlemom's, and they told me they did not know; I went to the door, but I did not go into the room; there was a ring; she came out, and I came directly; I did not take any thing.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

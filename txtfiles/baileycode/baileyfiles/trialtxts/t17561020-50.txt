            . I live in Gravel lane


, I lost a gown out of my room, and the prisoner took it.
Q. How do you know that?
Hardley. Because when I took her she own'd it, and carried me to the pawnbroker's house where she had pawn'd it.
Q. Did she live in the house with you?
Hardley. No, she did not; she used to come along with a ballad-singer to my house. She came one night and I let her in, and having no place to lie at I permitted her to lie at my bed's feet. I went out in the morning to get myself a pot of beer, and when I came back she and the gown were both gone.
Q. When had you seen it last?
Hardley. I had it in my hand about an hour before I went out. The people underneath where I live said they saw the prisoner go out with a bundle under her cloaths, when I was gone.
Q. Where did you meet with her again?
Hardley. About Broad St. Giles's.
Q. Did you charge her with taking the gown?
Hardley. Yes I did, and she said she got a key, open'd my door, and took the gown out.
Q. Did you make her any promises before this?
Hardley. I promised I would not prosecute her, if she would confess.
Q. Then how came it about that you do prosecute her?
Hardley. Because I could not get the gown from the pawnbroker without it.
Q. Where did she say the pawnbroker lived?
Hardley. She went along with me to the house, and called for it in her own name.

Q. Where is your gown?
Hardley. It is at the pawnbroker's now.
Q. What is his name?
Hardley. He is here, his name is 
               
                  Henry 
                  Gear 
               



            .


                  Henry 
                  Gear 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, my master's name is 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Urwin 
               



            ; the prisoner brought me a gown to pawn on the 16th of September.
Q. Where is the gown?
Gear. It is not here.
Q. What did you lend her upon it?
Gear. Three shillings.
Q. to Prosecutor. Did you see the gown at the pawnbroker's house?
Prosecutor. I did.
Q. What is the colour of it?
Prosecutor. A brown copper colour.
Q. to Gear. What colour'd gown did the prisoner bring to you?
Gear. It is the same colour the prosecutor describes.


                  Cecilia 
                  Hardley 
               



            . I am wife to the prosecutor; the gown that is lost is mine, I had not worn it. I hung it upon a line, intending to throw this away that I have on, being a very bad one. I went out with my husband, and in the mean time the prisoner open'd the door, as she herself confessed, and took it away.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her own defence.



               Guilty

            . I live in Billiter-square, and am a merchant
. On the 24th of September, about two o'clock in the day, I was in Fenchurch-street


, and felt some person pick my pocket; I turned round, and found the prisoner secreting my handkerchief in his coat - I seized him immediately - there was another lad with him, but he went away.

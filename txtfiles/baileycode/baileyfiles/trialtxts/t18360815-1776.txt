JACOB ISRAEL BRANDON
. I live in Bishopsgate-street, without. I was walking down Broad-street on the 28th of July, with a gentleman, who told me something that induced me to search my pockets, and my handkerchief was gone—I looked about, and saw the prisoner putting it in his pocket—I followed him, he threw it down—I stopped to pick it up, and fell down—he turned round, and said he hoped I was not hurt, could he assist, me—I collared him and gave him in charge of the policeman—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner. I never had it in my possession—I saw two lads come up a turning, and this gentleman was running after them, with a stick in one hand and a handkerchief in the other—he fell down just as he got close to me—I assisted to take him up. Witness. I was running after him—he was the person I was running after.




GUILTY
. Aged 20—


Transported for Seven Years.

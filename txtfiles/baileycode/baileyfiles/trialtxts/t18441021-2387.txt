JOHN LEWIS
. I live in Colchester-street, Whitechapel. Between seven and eight o'clock. on Thursday evening, the 19th of September, I was in Fen-church-street, and saw the prisoner take a box off the hind part of Mr. John Dale's wagon, which was going on at the time—he walked away with it—I went and stopped the wagon, and told the driver directly.





CHARLES GARRETT ROE
. I am foreman to John Dale, of Stoney-lane, Southwark. I saw the wagon loaded, and this box put into it—it was directed to Perry, of Bow—I could find no such person there, and it was brought back in the wagon—it contained files from Sheffield—the invoice value of them was 7l. 11s. 4d.—it was under the charge of John Dale, who was responsible for its safety.





ELIAS BENEY
. I am wagoner to Mr. Dale. This box was on my wagon on the evening of the 19th of Sept.—I found it was taken out—I know it again.





JAMES LAMBOLE
 (City police-constable, No. 511.) I saw the prisoner carrying this box—before I could get to him he dropped it—I followed him calling, "Stop thief"—my brother officer stopped him in Catherinewheel-alley, leading from Fenchurch-street—the box was taken up by another officer and a young man—it weighs above 1 cwt.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Fenchurch-street; a man tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me to carry a box to the corner of St. Katharine's Docks, and lie would give me 1s.; being in great distress, 1 did so; at the corner of the alley I heard a cry of "Stop thief," turned round, and saw the man run away; I was frightened, and ran also.





JOHN LEWIS

re-examined. The prisoner is the man I saw take it.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

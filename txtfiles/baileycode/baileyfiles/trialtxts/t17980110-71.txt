            . In consequence of some information that I had received, on Monday, the 18th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, I searched the privy upon my premises, and over the entrance of the door, on the inside, there were a great many pieces of indigo secreted, it was in a dark place, where no light comes; it was concealed upon the loose timbers.
Q. Were they in a situation that persons might have seen them if they had not been looking for them? - A. I think not; I marked four of the pieces with my pencil, with the initials of my name, and placed them in the same situation again; I directed one of my men, who saw me mark it, to stay there while I went home, and got my great coat, as I thought it was likely to be a night job to watch; I placed myself in an adjoining privy, where I could see whoever came to the other privy, and they could not see me: In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come out of the privy where the indigo was secreted; I let him pass the privy where I was, and went to feel if the indigo was gone, and I found it was; I followed him immediately, and as he was going past Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, on the wharf, I collared him; he asked me what was the matter; I told him, I had reason to think he was extremely fond of indigo; and as he went along, I observed he had his hands in his pockets; and I told him, if he did not take his hands from his pockets, I would certainly break his arm, I had a short stick in my hand; I took him to our accompting-house, and searched him; I took out of his pocket, two pounds four ounces of indigo, amongst them were two of the pieces that I had marked, (produces them); I went to search his lodgings, and then he said, it was the first time.
Q. Did you make him any promise of favour, or use any threat? - A. Not at all; he said, he had taken it out of No. 20, that is one of the warehouses that was full of indigo; he said, he had about a pound at home, that he took it when he went home to dinner.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are there any other persons among the bull-porters, than those you have just mentioned? - A. There are not.

Q. This privy is upon the open wharf? - A.It is close to the water-side.
Q. Therefore every person on the wharf has access to it? - A. Yes.
Q. The prisoner is a very tall man? - A. Yes.
Q. Therefore he might have seen this indigo there? - A. It is a dark place, generally used for paper.
Q. Therefore in feeling for paper, he might have felt the indigo? - A. He might certainly.
Mr. Jackson. Q. Was he a labourer in your warehouse? - A. Yes.
- Fox sworn. - I am clerk to these gentlemen: I took a candle and lanthorn after the prisoner was brought into the accompting-house, and in the yard, between the privy and the accompting-house, I found several pieces of indigo, among them were two pieces marked

             sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Gossett: I was present when the prisoner was searched; I said, Armstrong, I doubt this is not the first time; he said, it was; says I, have you got none at home; he said, yes, he had a pound; I asked him, how he came by that that was found upon him; I said, this indigo came out of No. 20, did it not; he said, yes, I took it out of No. 20, this morning.
Prisoner's defence. I found the indigo there, and took it away.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

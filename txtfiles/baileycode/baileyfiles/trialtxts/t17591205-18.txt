            . My husband's name is William, the prisoner came to live with me on the Tuesday, and she stole my husband's watch on the Wednesday; she took away also the other things mentioned in the indictment.
Q. How do you know she stole the things?

            . The prisoner was Mrs. Braddock's Servant. I being a neigbour she desired I would go with her to the prisoner after she was in the gatehouse, where the prisoner delivered the watch to me; she was stop'd at a pawnbroker's as she was going to pawn the cardinal, so the prosecutrix came to know of it; she was taken before justice Carkass, where she owned the taking of the things, all but the watch; that was not missing then. [The goods produced in court and deposed to.]
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

ABRAHAM REES. I lodge at Mr. Solomons', No. 52, Strand



. The prisoner was in his service - I used to send plate into the kitchen to be cleaned; I missed two tablespoons about three weeks ago - they are perhaps worth about 1l.

                  Henry 
                  Solomons
               



            . The prosecutor's plate used to be cleaned in the kitchen - the prisoner was in the habit of visiting at the house, and I have occasionally left her alone in the kitchen; I have seen two table-spoons, which we used to have in the kitchen to clean - they were the prosecutor's, and I missed them about three months ago.
Prisoner. She has known me six years, and has been at my house when she was out of a situation. Witness. Yes, I have. I never knew her to be dishonest.
GEORGE WILLIAMS. I am in my father's service, he is a pawnbroker, in Great Chapel-street, Westminster. These spoons were pawned by the prisoner in January -I cannot tell the day, as a person came on the 21st of April and had a fresh duplicate in another name; I know the prisoner's person, and think I had seen her before.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. Poverty and distress drove me to it; I am a widow with two children.

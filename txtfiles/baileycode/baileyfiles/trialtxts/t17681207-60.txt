            . I live in Red Bull-yard, Clerkenwell


. About five weeks ago the prisoner lodged in my own room with me: she had not been with me above seven nights before I went out, and left her in the room; I was not gone above twenty- three minutes; when I returned she was gone, and all the things laid in the indictment. (Mentioning them.) I never saw her again till she was taken up; which was Monday was se'nnight.

            . I saw the prisoner go out of the prosecutrix's house, that day she was robbed, with a lap full of things.
Prisoner's Defence.
On a Saturday night before this, she asked me for a bit of fish; she went out to buy some. I went to buy a pair of shoes in Rosemary-lane, and met with a woman, where I staid all night; after I heard she had been robbed: I came to her: she charged me with taking her things.

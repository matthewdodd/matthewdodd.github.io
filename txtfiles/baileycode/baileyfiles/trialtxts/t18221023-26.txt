            . I am a porter
, and live in Carter-lane, Doctors' Commons. On the 1st of October, about six in the evening, I had this cloth in a cart, among other things. I was going to take it to the Borough; it was safe in Gracechurch-street


 when I left the cart, to deliver a parcel. I returned in three minutes, and found the prisoner on the shafts of the cart, with it in his arms. I caught him by the jacket, and he dropped it, and was secured. It lay in the body of the cart, and measured thirty-five yards.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. It was in the middle of the cart - A. Yes; he had got it on the shaft; he had moved the whole of it from the body of the cart - I am positive of it.

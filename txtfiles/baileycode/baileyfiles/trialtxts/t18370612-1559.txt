JOHN WILLIAM SMITH
 I am a dyer, and live at Eagle House, Mile-end-road. I had two live fowls, a live duck and drake, on the 11th of June, in my poultry-yard—I lost them and saw them again before the Magistrate—these are parts of the wings which have been preserved.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. What are the marks by which you know them? A. Only by the colour—my premises are surrounded by a high wall—I have watchmen and large dogs—I cannot say when I saw them safe—I should think they must have got out before they could be stolen—I have inquired about the prisoner—his friends are very respectable—I speak to the birds from their general appearance.





SAMUEL POPE
 (police-constable K 24.) At a quarter before two, on the morning of the 11th of June, I saw the prisoner at the bottom of Norfolk-street, not a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—he had a bulky appearance, and seeing me approach him he made off as fast as he could—just before I caught him he dropped two dead fowls—when I caught him he said, "Don't ill use me, I have a duck in my pocket"—I pulled out a drake, and searched the other pocket, and found a duck-they were dead, but quite hot.

Cross-examined. Q. Was he in liquor? A. He was.
(Robert Dixon, undertaker, of Stepney-green, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.

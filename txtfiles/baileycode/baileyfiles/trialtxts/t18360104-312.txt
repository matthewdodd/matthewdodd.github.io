WILLIAM MARTIN SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of December, 2 spoons, value 25s.; and 12 printed books, value 12l.; the goods of 



Jacob Unwin, his master.






JACOB UNWIN
. I am a printer and stationer. The prisoner had been between five and six months in my employ as light porter and errand-boy—I missed a dessert spoon about the middle of November, and a table spoon on the 13th or 14th of December—I found all the property at the pawnbroker's.





HENRY LOOSEMOORE
. I am assistant to Mr. Whiskard, a pawnbroker, in Bishopsgate-street. I produce two spoons, and two books—the prisoner

pawned one spoon and a jacket—the other goods I cannot recollect who pawned—they were pawned in the course of nearly four months.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Yes—his friends are respectable—I can identify this spoon as pawned by him—I thought it was his father's—he has redeemed several articles.





WILLIAM CHAPMAN
. I am a pawnbroker. I have eleven books pawned by the prisoner.





THOMAS SAPWELL
. I took the prisoner, and found seventeen dupllicates on him, which relate to the spoons, books, and a jacket.

MR. UNWIN
re-examined. These books are my property, and the spoons are mine—here are four spoons not mine.

Cross-examined. Q. How do you know you may not have sold these books? A. This one I have only a single book of, and it was not sold—it is worth 5s.—here is a single volume of another work, which had not been in my stock one week before I missed it—the prisoner had been with me five or six months—I had a verbal testimony as to his past conduct—he came only as temporary servant.
(Mr. Gilbert McMurdo, surgeon of Newgate, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 22.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

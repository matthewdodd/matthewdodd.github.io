            . I am a tailor
, and live in Newman-street. On the 9th of August, a little after eleven o'clock at night, I was at the corner of George-street, St. Giles's


, with two pair of trowsers in a bundle. I saw the prisoner and two others at the opposite corner; he crossed directly over to me, snatched the bundle from under my arm, and ran off with it - I followed, calling Stop thief! His companions crosed between us to hinder me, but I kept my eye on him - he ran away with a number of them. I was afraid to go in after him - he was stopped in a minute. My bundle was conveyed away. I am positive he is the man, for I did not lose sight of him.

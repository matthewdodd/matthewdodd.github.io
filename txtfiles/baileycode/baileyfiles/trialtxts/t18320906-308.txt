            . I am a hosier and glover
, and live in Quadrant, Regent-street


. On the 14th of August, about six o'clock in the evening, two persons came into my shop, and asked to see some silk handkerchiefs, which I showed them; they said there was none of the sort they wanted, would I show them more - I did so; they wanted some with a border, and while I was looking for some, I saw the prisoner put his hand over the shop window, and take something; my wife came out of the parlour, and said,"There is a man running out with some gloves;" he was running out - I pursued him down Vine-street, and cried,"Stop him!" and when I got up to him, a Policeman ran across the road, and stopped him; I had seen him let the gloves fall - there are twenty-five pairs; he was never out of my sight.

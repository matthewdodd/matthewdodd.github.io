            , lodged in my House; on the 7th of September, about eleven o'Clock at Night, when they came Home, they wanted some small Beer - they came Home both together; I desired them to go to Bed; but I could not get them to go to Bed; they insisted upon it, that they would not go to Bed that Night, and they did not go to Bed; I catched the Prisoner at the Till, in the Shop, over Night, and I missed the Things in the Morning; there were ten Pounds worth of Things gone, but I only charged them with these; a Sheet, an Apron, a Hat, a Cloth Coat, a Silver Tea-Spoon, six Holland Shirts, five Shirts, and five Shillings in Money: The Constable has a Shift, which was taken off the Prisoner's Back. When the Prisoner was in the Shop, at the Till, I asked her what she was doing there; she said, she was only looking into the Till; I believe I missed eight Shillings, but I only charged her with five Shillings; she said

             did it; there were found upon the Prisoner the Silk Handkerchief, a Shift, and an Holland Apron; she confessed she took them.
Q What did you say to her, did you promise her any thing if she would confess.
Parrot. I told her I would not prosecute her, if she would confess; but she would not; I lost Abundance more Things, but there's enough of it; I have said enough.

            . I took the Handkerchief, the Apron, and the Shift. off the Prisoner; when I took them off, she said, she would give me a Shilling, if I would say nothing to Mrs Parrot; when she offered me the Shilling, I told her, I would not be bribed by a Thief; for if God did not send me Bread one Day, he would another, for myself and my Children.
Prisoner. I did not say I would give her a Shilling.
Q. Did she offer you a Shilling not to speak of it?
White. She did not offer me a Shilling, but she promised me one.

             did not come Home till two, and she gave me these Things; I did not know but they were her own; I saw no Money, nor never was nigh the Till. Mrs Parrot was very much in Liquor, and I left her asleep when I went to Bed.

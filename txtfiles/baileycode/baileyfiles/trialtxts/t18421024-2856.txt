ROBERT SINCFIELD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of September, 10 coats, value 5l., the goods of 



Hannah Godby; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CORNELIUS RYAN
. I am shopman to Hannah Godby, in Brooke-street, Holborn. About half-past seven o'clock, on the 27th of September, I saw the prisoner running away with another person—one of them dropped ten coats—I never lost sight of the prisoner till I took him—the coats had been on the counter, within three yards of the shop door.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with them? A. I saw you running after they were dropped—I cannot say which of you dropped them—you ran different ways.





WILLIAM LUCK
. I was sitting in the parlour, between seven and eight o'clock, and I saw a person go out—I followed—I saw two boys, one of whom was the prisoner—when I got to them, one of them chucked down a lot of coats, I do not know which it was.

Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to me? A. By your person and your coat.





JOHN BARNES
 (City police-constable, No. 273.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I stopped the prisoner, who was running—I got these coats off the counter in the shop.

Prisoner's Defence. I was playing down Brooke's-market; I saw a mob at the door, came up, and ran into the policeman's arms; the man called out, "Take him."





THOMAS BRADLEY
 (City police-Constable, No. 269.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

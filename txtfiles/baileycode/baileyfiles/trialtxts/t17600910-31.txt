Hannah Wootton. I live in Red Cross street by Cripplegate


; this morning the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, I saw her put her hand in her pocket, and after she was gone, I miss'd four yards and a half of ribbon.
Q. Did she buy any thing?
H. Wootton. No, she did not agree with me for any thing, I did not like her, and so she went away; I had shewn her two drawers of ribbon; after she was gone I was standing at my door, and she came by again, and I stopp'd her, and found the ribbon upon her.

            . After the prisoner was gone, my mother was standing at the door, the prisoner came by, and my mother pull'd her in.
Q. How long had she been gone?
C. Wootton. She had been gone the value of half an hour; she was searched in the shop after we got a constable, and we found the ribbon upon her.

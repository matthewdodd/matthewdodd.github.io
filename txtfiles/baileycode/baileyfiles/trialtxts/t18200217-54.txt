            . I am servant to Mr. 
               
                  James 
                  Campbell
               



            , who lives in Baker-street


. On the 26th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, I brought the gig out of the stable - the coat was on the gig; I went into the stable to fetch the horse out, and a boy hallooed out that the coat was gone. I directly pursued the prisoner, and saw it under his arm. He threw it down, and was stopped by Christmas.

            . I was going by, heard the cry, and stopped the prisoner at the corner of Baker-street - he threatened to knock me down. Hewitt was close behind with the great coat.

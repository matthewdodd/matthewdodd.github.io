EDWARD SULLINGS
. I am in the employ of Mr. Peggs, a confectioner, in Whitechapel-road. On the 21st of Jan., about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the shop of Eliza Ann Plum—I saw the prisoner take twelve shirts from the counter, and throw them down outside, and two boys outside took them—one of them dropped the bundle—I ran, but did not take either of them—I took the prisoner in the shop.





CHARLOTTE PLUM
. I live with my daughter Eliza Ann Plum, who keeps a hosier's shop in Whitechapel-road. There were three bundles taken—the other two are quite lost—I picked up the bundle that was dropped just outside the door—I am quite sure these are my daughter's shirts.

Prisoner. I went to buy a shoe-lace, and while I was there, some one must have come in, and got these; there was no one outside; the lady left me at the door, and I did not move. Witness. I was in the act of giving him

change—I saw something, and ran to the door, and took this bundle up—I turned to the prisoner, and told him he was one of the boys, but I did not know that he was the one that took them—they had been on the opposite counter to me, about three yards from the door—the prisoner must have turned round to get them—there was no one in the shop but the prisoner and I—there had been another, but he went out before the prisoner came in.





EDWARD SULLINGS

re-examined. I ran after the other two, and Mrs. Plum detained the prisoner in the shop—I am sure I saw the prisoner move the bundle to the other two.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

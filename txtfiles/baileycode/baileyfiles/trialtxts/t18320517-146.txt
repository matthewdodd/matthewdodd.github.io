            . I am a bricklayer's labourer
. On the 4th of May the prisoner lodged, for two nights, and slept in the same room with me and two more women; I slept alone - I left my handkerchief on the top of my clothes when I went to bed, and the prisoner took that and a pair of shoes - one of the other women in the room is my grandmother, who has not been out of bed for twelve months; I never gave the prisoner permission to pawn any of my things - she gets her living in the streets.

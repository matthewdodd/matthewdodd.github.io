            . I went to a public house in Holborn


 for a pint of beer, about noon; I took out a 4 s. 6 d. piece to pay for my beer, and the prisoner snapped it out of my hand, and went out; I went out but could not see him: I took him up about ten days after; I staid in the house till three o'clock, but he did not come back.
Q. from the prisoner. Did not you give it me to get changed?
Ryan. I did not.

            . I was in the public house; the landlord said he would not change it for a pint of beer; then the prisoner said give it me; the prosecutor did not give it him, but he snapped it out of his hand; he pursued the prisoner but could not find him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I took it to get it changed; I lost it and was afraid to come back again.

             was again indicted for 


               a like offence

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road, and dealt with Messrs. Davenport. On the 8th of June, 1825, the prisoner called on me; I paid him 8l. 12s. on account ofMessrs. Davenport; I took his receipt, which I produce; I am certain there were some sovereigns among the amount.

            . I am clerk to 
               
                  John 
                  Davenport
               




             and others. The prisoner was in their employ, and received money on their account, which he should account to me for; I have the book here in his hand-writing; he entered all the cash here which he received; there is no sum whatever accounted for as received from Huxley on the 8th of June; this account is not entered at all; he left in July, without warning; we could not find him till he was apprehended; this receipt is in his hand-writing.
Prisoner's Defence. I was in the greatest distress, with a wife and six children; my salary was to be 65l., and I was to have 2s. a-day travelling expenses; I received 1l. every week, on account - the balance still retnains in the prosecutor's hands; I conceived this amount might be placed to the account of my salary; I have not been from London.

H. E. TEMPLE
            . I do not know how the prisoner was paid - he drew something every week, and I believe so much every quarter besides; he never came to claim any amount due to him.

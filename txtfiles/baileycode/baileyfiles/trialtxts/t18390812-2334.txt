CHRISTOPHER PICKERING
. I am master of a ship. On the 13th of August, at near twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner at tlie end of Red Lion-street, Wapping—I was not tipsy—she spoke to me first, and asked me to go with her—I said I wanted nothing with her—she walked by my side, and at last took hold of me in a very unbecoming manner—I put her away, and while I did that, I felt her hand in my pocket—I said, "You are robbing me"—she said, "If you say I am robbing you, good night," and away she run—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed a sovereign and a five-shilling piece—I am certain they had been in my pocket before—the policeman came up, and asked if I had been robbed—we pursued, and caught her—she said she knew nothing at all about it—the policeman took her, and in about a minute a five-shilling piece dropped from her person—it was picked up—in taking her to the watch-house the policeman noticed her doing something about her gown-sleeve—he took a bag from her hand, and the sovereign was in it.





JOHN NICHOLAS
.(police-sergeant K 1.) The prosecutor accused the prisoner of robbing him—when I came up I asked her what she had done with the man's money—she said she knew nothing about it—the prosecutor appeared to me to know what he was about—I took the prisoner—she dropped a crown-piece, and on her way to the station-house I found she was shuffling about the sleeves of her gown—I found this bag in her hand with a sovereign in it.

Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the money to go with him, and when I was coming away, he said if I did not give it to him he would give me in charge—he was quite tipsy—I did not know whether it was a sovereign or a shilling.

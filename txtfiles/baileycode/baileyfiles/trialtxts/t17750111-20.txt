            . I live two doors from Mr. Chapman's house. While I was standing at my door, I saw the prisoner run out of Mr. Chapman's gateway with a hat in his hand; he was pursued with the cry of stop thief; he threw the hat against the India-house and ran off, I pursued him and brought him back; he begged of me to let him go, and said he would never do so again: (the hat produced.)

            , Esq. This is my hat; it was taken out of the hall.

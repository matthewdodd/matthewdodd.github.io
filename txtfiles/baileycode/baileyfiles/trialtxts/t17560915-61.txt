            . I met the two women on Ludgate-Hill, on the 6th of September, about ten at night. They asked me to treat them, and took me to the Shepherd and Goat by Fleetditch



, where they call'd for cyder and brandy; but after we had been together a little time, they were gone in a moment. I missed my watch in five or six minutes after. I soon took Williams, and the next morning. I found Leatherton. Williams confessed to the constable and me that she took it, and Leatherton own'd she had 8 s, 6 d. of the money it was sold for, and that it was sold by the man at the bar, at the Harrow in Water-Lane, for 22 s. to a watchmaker; but I never found it again.

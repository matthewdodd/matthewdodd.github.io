, stealing 1 watch, value 2l. 15s.; the goods of 



Thomas Bolton, from his person.






THOMAS BOLTON
. I live at 51, Strand, and am a doctor's boy. On 2nd Nov., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, a woman accosted me in Bedford-place—she walked with me till we came to Russell-square, where she stopped, and we got talking together—I missed my watch, and caught hold of her—the prisoner whom I saw seven or eight yards off came behind her—I saw her hand my watch to him—I let go the woman and took hold of the prisoner—he gave me a blow in the face, knocked me from him, and ran away to the corner of Montague-place, where he stopped—I came up to him, and charged him with having my watch—he denied it—a gentleman requested him if he were innocent to be searched—he said be would not—he was taken into custody—he resisted when he was stopped.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. How long were you with this female? A. About five minutes—I was sober—the prisoner was standing still when I came up to him—it was all the work of a moment—there was another person with him in the square.





ROBERT DAINES
. I met the prisoner running down Bedford-place—I caught him—he bit me on both arms—I had a long struggle with him—I got him down, and kept him till the officer came.





CHARLES JORDAN
 (policeman, E 165). I took the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Clarke of Exeter'Change


; Clements produced to me the articles stated in the indictment; which have my marks on them, and belong to Mr. Clark; but when they were taken I do not know; I know nothing of the prisoners.

            . I found this case of razors in Pink's coat-pocket; he said Kelk stole them from Exeter 'Change and gave them to him; Kelk came up, and said he had stolen them, and that Pink was always telling him to steal them, and wanted him to steal another hat from Bowler's; Kelk then said he had two other razors at his mother's; I went there, and found 2 razors, a knife, and scissars; in Pink's box I found the rest of the property.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Seven witnesses gave Kelk a good character.

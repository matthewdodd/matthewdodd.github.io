 It appeared on the Tryal, that the Prisoners being suspected as ill persons, were seized upon by the Constable, at which time the Prisoners were seen to throw several pick-lock Keys out at the Window, and farther search being made, the Plates in the Indictment were found in the House; the Mistress of the house deposing, that she saw the Prisoners bring in the Plates: The Prisoners giving a slender account of themselves, and Clark and Thacker having been formerly Branded in the Hand they were all found 

               Guilty
            .

DANIEL CLARK
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of October, 9 handkerchiefs, value 36s., and 1 scarf, value 14s., the goods of 



William Tent; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL THOMAS
. I am in the employ of Mr. William Tent, of Sweeting's-rents, Royal Exchange. The prisoner came into the shop on the 1st

of October, and asked for some black worsted gloves—while I turned to get them he took a satin scarf off the counter and put it under his coat—I saw him do it—my master came in, and I saw the prisoner go to the bottom of the shop and take nine handkerchiefs—I told him to put them down—he threw them down and ran out—I ran and took him, and asked him to put down the scarf—he dropped it, and said he had not been in the shop—it was dropped at the corner of Thread needle-street—I did not see him drop it.





HENRY STEVENSON
. I saw the prisoner running round the corner of Thread needle-street, and he dropped this scarf.





GEORGE PALMER
 (police—on stable F 125.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, on the 2nd of April last—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 10th of October while I was standing among the crowd in Guild-hall


, I was informed by a gentleman that my pocket was picked; I felt and missed my handkerchief; a gentleman secured the prisoner; I had it in my hand about ten minutes before.

            . I was in Guildhall the 10th of this month; I saw the prisoner very busy from place to place; at last I saw him take the prosecutor's handkerchief out of his pocket and thrust it into his breeches. I secured him, and made him pull the handkerchief out of his breeches.

I am as innocent as the child unborn. I picked the handkerchief up in the Hall; I put it in my pocket; a person made a snatch at it, so I put it in my breeches.

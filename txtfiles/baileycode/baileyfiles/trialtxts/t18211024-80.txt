            . I am a shoemaker, and live in St. John-street, Smithfield. On the 17th of October, I was in St. John-square


, and saw the prisoners in company together - a boy, about nine years old, had a little girl in his arms, they were looking at Punch - Harris put his hand up to the child's neck, unlocked the necklace, and took it off; I saw it in his hand, they were both close together; I collared Harris, took him out of the crowd, and he dropped it - I took Cockham soon after, he had not run away.

            . The prisoner is my brother. On the 19th of March, about two o'clock, he took the shawl from off the chair-back, and went out to pledge it. I do not prosecute him for punishment - I wash and iron, night and day, to support him and myself, but he is always robbing me. I have neither father nor mother.

            . I met the prisoner in the New Road - He gave me the shawl to pledge for him; I pledged it for 1s.6d., and he bought some bread and cheese with it.

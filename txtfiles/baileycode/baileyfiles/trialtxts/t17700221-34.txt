            . I am master of Blackfryars workhouse
. The prisoner was in the work-house, and trusted to wash the people's linen: the things they wear are my property. The things laid in the indictment, and more, were missing. I suspected and charged the prisoner; she confessed she had pawned them, and directed me to the pawnbroker's. I have got all again, except one handkerchief.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

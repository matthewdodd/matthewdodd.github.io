1811. 




JAMES HOMER
 was indicted

 for stealing two gowns, value the goods of 



Robert Brook.






ELIZA BROOK
. I am the wife of Robert Brook, of Peter's-bill, Doctor's Commons. I had two dresses, which I saw safe at five minutes before eight o'clock, on the morning of the 11th of June—I missed them about five or ten minutes after eight—these now produced are them.





ROBERT BROOK
. On Tuesday the 11th of June, my mother went out a little after eight o'clock—a little after that the prisoner came and asked my sister to give him a light for his pipe—he went out, came again, knocked at

the door, and said, "Your mother has sent me after two gowns"—I said, "Where is she?"—he gave me no answer—there was another boy at the door with a bag—the prisoner came to the door, took the gowns, and put them into the bag, and both ran down the hill—I am sure the prisoner is the person.





JOSEPH HERRINGTON
 (City-police-constable, No. 112.) I received information, and went to Fore-street, where I saw the prisoner offering one of these gowns for pledge, about nine o'clock on this same morning, the 11th.




GUILTY
.** Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

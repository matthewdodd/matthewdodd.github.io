            . I am a builder
; the prisoner was my servant
, and employed to lock up the yard after the men had left. On the 4th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, having missed property several times, I suspected him; I lost the lead out of my yard, and the nails out of my office. I had marked the lead before.

            . I am an officer. I was applied to by the prosecutor, to watch the prisoner on Friday night. I saw him come out, apparently loaded, but lost him that night; I went again on Monday, and stopped him in Dean-street, found two pieces of lead in his breeches, and the nails in his hat, He had just come out of the premises.

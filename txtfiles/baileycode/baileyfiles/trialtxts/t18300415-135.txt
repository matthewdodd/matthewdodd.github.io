             - his stable is in Little Park-street-mews


. On the 6th of March I was returning to the stable - I saw the prisoner with his back to the door, about four yards from the stable; I had left my coat in the stable - he asked me for some name; I said no such person lived there - he turned away, and I saw he had my coat on his back; I thought it was mine, turned to the stable, and missed it - I overtook him in St. James'-park; I told him I wanted my coat; he said, "What coat?" I said the one he had on; I took him - this is my coat; he had nothing to do with my stables - I had not been away four minutes, and left the door latched.

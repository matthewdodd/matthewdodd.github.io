             , jun. Do you remember the Prisoner's bringing any Anchor that was sold at your Father's Shop, the 19th of December last.
Mackenzie . He came by our Shop at eight o'Clock in the Morning; he says to me, is Mr Mc Anoy at Home; I said yes; I went up and told my Father there was an Anchor came in, and he came down and examined him how he came by it; he told my Father he and the Men that worked with him dragged it out of the Thames; my Father asked him who were the Men, he said Mr Scot was one; so he gave him 3 s. 6 d. for it; my Father said this was all he would give till he saw Mr Scott.
The Prisoner was called upon to make his Defence; he said he did not steal it, but it was brought to him by another Man to sell for him.

            . My Lord, I was walking from the Post-House, between Swithin's-Lane and Sherborn-Lane; the Prisoner at the Bar twich'd the Hat off my Head, and between Sherborn-Lane and Cannon-Street he was taken.
Q. Did you come up to him when he was taken?
Martin. I cry'd out Stop Thief, and he (the Prisoner) cry'd out Stop Thief too.


                  Q.

            ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar? Did you take him upon Mr. Martin's crying out Stop Thief.
Starky. I was coming up Cannon-Street about three Quarters after Nine; upon that I heard the Cry of Stop Thief; I had not walk'd above twenty Yards before I saw the Prisoner run and cry'd Stop Thief himself, and I laid hold of him; he said he was robb'd and the Thief was gone before; but I held him, though he endeavour'd to get away, 'till Mr. Martin came up, who took the Hat out of his Hand.
Q. Then this is all you know?
Starky. Yes.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Martin) And this is the Hat.

Martin. Yes.
Court. Sir, you are a very kind Prosecutor to lay this Hat at 10 d.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What are you?
Prisoner. I am an Apprentice

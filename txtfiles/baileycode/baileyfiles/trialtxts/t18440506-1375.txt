THOMAS SCOTT
 was indicted

 for embezzlement; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN JONES
, baker, Norfolk-street, King's-cross. The prisoner was in my service—he was authorised to receive money for me, and was in the habit of doing so daily—on Thursday, the 18th of April, he went out, at five o'clock—he did not come back—I saw him on the following Wednesday at the station.





HENRY SHAWYER
 (police-constable S 45.) About one o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of April, I was on duty in Farringdon-square—I saw the prisoner standing there—he asked me for Sergeant Shaw—I asked if he wanted him particularly—he said, "No, not particularly; I suppose you have heard of Mr. Jones?"—he did not say what—I said, "Yes, and you may as well go with me as Sergeant Shaw," and he went with me to the station.





CAROLINE COBBETT
. I live in Princes-street, Leicester-square. I deal with Mr. Jones for bread, and work for his wife as a dress-maker—on Tuesday, the 16th April, the prisoner came to me with a bill to the amount of 3l. 14s. 4 3/4 d., for Mr. Jones—I paid him 3l. 4s. 6d., deducting 10s. for my bill—I gave him three sovereigns, half-a-crown, and two shillings—I folded it up in a piece of paper, sealed it, and gave it to my niece to direct, and give it to him.





SABINA DOLIMORE
. I am niece to Mrs. Cobbett. I received some money from her on Thursday, sealed in a brown paper parcel—I directed it, and gave it to the prisoner—I am sure I gave him the same parcel she gave me.

MR. JONES
re-examined. He never brought me this parcel.





FRANCES JONES
. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner never brought me this brown paper parcel.





JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 193.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

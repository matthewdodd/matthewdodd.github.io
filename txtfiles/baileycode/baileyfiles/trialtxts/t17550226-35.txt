            . I am wife to the prosecutor; the prisoner came into our shop on the 12th of February, she took up a cup, I thought she was going to buy it, she took them all up and went out. I followed her and brought her back with the things under her cloak; she was taken before the justice and committed.
Prisoner's defence.
I was not sensible of any thing about it, I have been out of my senses almost eighteen months.

            . I live in Grove-row, Mile End


. On the 15th of February, about one o'clock, these things were on the sideboard in the back parlour. About two o'clock my daughter heard a noise; I went up, found the window open, and missed them; there is a gate in the back garden, which was not fastened. My daughter rose an alarm, and the prisoner was brought back with the candlesticks, but not the spoon.

            . I am a milkman. I was near to the prosecutrix's house, talking to a man; a little girl came out, and said they had been robbed. I ran and secured the prisoner about a quarter of a mile off, and told him he had the candlesticks; he said he had not. I found them in his bag. Three others were with him, who ran away - his bag contained hearth-stones.

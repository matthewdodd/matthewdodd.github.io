            . I am in the service of Ellen Philpot, a widow
, who keeps a linen-draper's shop
, at the corner of Great Turnstile, Holborn


. On the 12th of February, I saw this cotton at the door when I went out at half past two o'clock; I returned about four o'clock; the officer was then in the shop with it - this is the cotton; it has our shop mark on it; it had been hanging by the side of the door.

            . I watched the prisoner and four other persons for some time; I saw her leave the prosecutrix's door very quickly; I followed her to Bedford-row, where I stopped her, and took this cotton from under her shawl - she did not go into the shop, but two women, who were with her did: the prisoner and a man stood at the window - when she ran off, they went down Holborn, and were taken by an officer, but they were let go.
Prisoner's Defence. I met two women, who spoke to me, and I went with them to buy a piece of cotton; Istood at the window, but did not go in; they came out and gave me this cotton, and told me to take it to a man on the other side of the way; I went there, but he was gone: I then went into Bedford-row.

            . I lost a surtout coat from off a box by my bed-side, on the 6th of March. On the Monday morning I went and found it at Mr. Paterson's, a pawnbroker; I took up the prisoner; he confessed before the Alderman he was in distress, and he took it, and thought to have brought it back again.
Coterill, servant to Mr. Paterson, deposed he lent the prisoner 18 d. upon the coat. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I did not take it with a design to keep it.

MARIA ROWE LACK
. I am a widow, and live in Tooley-street, I keep a tobacconist's-shop—on the 3rd of February I was coming out of the back-kitchen into the shop—I saw the prisoner reaching over the counter to the window where the tobacco and cigars were—he ran away—I followed him a short distance, and raised an alarm—I missed a roll of tobacco from the window, weighing 2 1/2lbs., which I had seen not three minutes before I saw him take it—this is it—(looking at it)—I can swear to it.





CHARLES NICHOLLS
. I am assistant to Mr. Byles. Last Monday; about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at our door, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I ran and stopped the prisoner, with this tobacco in his hand.

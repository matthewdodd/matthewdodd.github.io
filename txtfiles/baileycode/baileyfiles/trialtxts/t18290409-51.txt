            . I am a master baker. On the 3d of April I saw Mr. John Turk's truck at Shadwell


; the prisoner and two other lads were standing by it - I suspected, and watched them; I saw the prisoner take three loaves of bread out, and run down Field's-alley with the other two; I pursued, and took him, but the bread was gone - it was lost in less than five minutes.

            . I am a baker, and work for Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Turk
               



            . I left my master's truck in Shadwell High-street; I was absent from it about eight minutes - when I returned three loaves were gone; they have never been found.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not take them; a captain asked me to carry his box, and gave me 2s. for it; when I was taken I said if he would let me go I would pay for the loaves.

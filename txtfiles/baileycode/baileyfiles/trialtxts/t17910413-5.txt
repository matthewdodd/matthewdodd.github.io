I am twelve years next October, I live in Park-lane


, my father is a publican
; if I swear wrong I go to the devil, and if I swear right I do not; on the 13th of this month I was in my father's tap-room, making shirts; he lives in Park-lane, it was about six in the evening, nobody was in the tap-room, my mother went backwards to fetch a plate; the prisoner was drinking a pint of purl, he was there all the afternoon, I was marking of shirts, and I went out of doors to thread my needle, it was rather dark, and I laid the shirt on the bench, and he took and put it into his pocket, I saw him do it; he had been at our house once or twice; I ran after him, and a gentleman caught him a good way off; I saw him taken, and the shirt was in his waistcoat; I saw it taken from him.

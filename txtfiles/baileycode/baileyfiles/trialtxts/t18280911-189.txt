            . I am shopman to Mary Gilbert - she did live in Cockspur-street, Charing-cross; she is a widow- she is a goldsmith and jeweller. On the 31st of July I watched the shop window; I saw the two prisoners there: Mayston put his hand through a pane of glass, (which had been previously broken), and took hold of this case of articles; Bullock was close by him, and when he drew them out Bullock took them of him, they immediately parted- I ran and took Mayston, and my fellow-shopman took Bullock, and when he had got hold of him I saw him throw two of these articles into the road; they were taken to St. Martin's watch-house - the articles are worth 50s.

            . I am porter to Mary Gilbert. - Staples gave me some information; I ran out and took Bullock; I saw these things fall from him, either at the moment I took hold of him, or just before; it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.

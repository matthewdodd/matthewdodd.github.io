THOMAS ZINZAN
 (police-constable N 67.) On the 10th of April, I was in Regent-street, City-road, at a quarter past nine o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner carrying something bulky on his shoulders, in a bag—I stopped him, and asked what it was—he said a piece of coal—I found it was lead—I asked where he brought it from—he said from Davies Wharf, out of a canal boat—I said what was the name of the boat, or the master—he did not know either—he said he was going to sell it, to get a little money—I went to the wharf, and found it had been taken from the roof—I compared it—it fitted exactly—here is 112lbs. of it.

Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you a man asked me to carry It, and said he would give me 6d., and if you would go back, I would take you to where I had it from? A. No.





MARY ANN NEWRY
. I had the care of the premises—it is a whitening factory, on the Macclesfield Wharf, belonging to Mr. Edward Walker—I had seen it safe 10 days before—I was showing it to a gentleman—it was very good, and there was not a tile moved—the policeman came to me on Tuesday, and I saw every tile had been moved, and this lead was taken from the top—I have seen it fitted, and am confident it is the same.

Prisoner. A man called me by name, and said if I would carry it to the end of Regent-street, he would give me 6d.—I did not know whether it was coal or lead.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

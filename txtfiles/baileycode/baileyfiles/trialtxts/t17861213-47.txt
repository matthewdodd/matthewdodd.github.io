I live in Turk's-row, Chelsea


: I know the prisoner; I never saw him, till I saw him at the far end of my garden, taking some linen; about half after twelve, the 28th of November I went down, and he had a gown wrapped up; there was a great deal of linen in the garden, and it rained; when I went down, he had got out of the garden into the pump-yard; I took hold his left arm, and he had the gown under his right arm, and dropped it down a back cellar window of my house; I saw him drop it; I had hold of him. (The gown produced and deposed to.) He was taken into custody directly.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I met a man, who told me to go to Turk's-row to get work, and being a stranger, I thought the prosecutor's house was a thoroughfare, and I went in, and a lad was there with the gown, and he chucked down the gown and ran away; and the prosecutor came down, and said he saw somebody in the garden, and said it was me.
Prosecutor. It is entirely false, there was no other boy.

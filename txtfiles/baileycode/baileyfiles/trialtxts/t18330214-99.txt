            . On the 13th of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Portman-street, and saw the prisoner with two loaves in his hand - he ran away round Portman-square, into Edward-street; I called Stop thief! and pursued him - he threw the bread down; I followed, and saw him stopped - I am sure he is the man; I did not see where he got it from.

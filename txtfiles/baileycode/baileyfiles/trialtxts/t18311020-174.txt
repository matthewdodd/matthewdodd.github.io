            . I missed two pick-axes on the afternoon of the 10th of October - I had left them safe at dinner time; I found them at a broker's shop - the prisoner used to work on the building, but did not then.

            . I live in Green's-court. I bought these two pick-axes of the prisoner, last Tuesday week in the afternoon - he came first, and asked if I would buy them; I said Yes, if they were his own - he said they were; that he was out of employ, and wanted victuals - he brought them; I had not change, and I sent for it - a person came by, and said he would give 1s. for one of them - I said No, I had bought them.

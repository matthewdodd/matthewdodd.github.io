            . I am wife to William Green. I take in quilting, the prisoner work'd with me, and took an opportunity to take the hat mention'd in the indictment.
Q. How do you know that?
Letitia Green. She absconded, I found her and asked her about it; she own'd she took it, and said she had sold it to a woman that was gone to Cambridge. I never found it since.
Samuel Green. I heard the prisoner say she had pawn'd the hat in Grub street. We went there, the pawnbroker said there was no such thing there; after that she said she sold it to a woman that was gone to Cambridge.
Prisoner's Defence.
They affrighted me so that I did not know what I said.

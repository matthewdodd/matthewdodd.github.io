JEPTHAH HUNTLEY. I am a hatter
, in partnership with my brother, in Sweeting's-alley, Royal-Exchange



. I lost the plate, cash, and notes mentioned in the indictment, on the 24th of January, out of an iron safe; I have a list of them - they were in a wooden box in the safe or book-case, which was locked; I had it safe on Saturday, the 23rd, and missed them on Sunday, between six and seven o'clock- I saw the plate at the Mansion-house, but not the notes or money; I have a glass belonging to the silver creamewer.

            . I am brother of the last witness, and can confirm his evidence, as to the things being in the book-case - we each had a key; the lock had been forced open.

            . I live next door to Messrs. Huntley; they broke into my premises, and so got to theirs.

            . About three o'clock on Sunday, the 24th of January, I was in Sweeting's-alley, and saw the prosecutors' shop door open - I went to ring a bell, and heard a step; I turned, and saw the prisoner - I ran and seized him; he unbuttoned his coat, and this bundle, containing the articles, fell down - I took them up; I knew him before - I found this skeleton-key on him, and these other things on the premises.

            . I was in the kitchen of a coffee-house, and heard a cry; I went out, and assisted in taking the prisoner; I saw the officer and the prisoner struggling together, and this bundle of plate on the ground.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing through Sweeting's-alley, and the officer accosted me by name; I turned - he seized me, and said, "You shall not escape if the rest have;" this bundle was laying at his feet; I did resist, knowing I was innocent.

                  WILLIAM MORGAN
               



            . He opened his coat himself, and the parcel fell down.

            . My shop is at No. 17, Sweeting's-alley



 - it was all safe on Saturday evening, the 23rd of January, at eight o'clock; on Sunday, between five and six a message was sent to me - I came, and found a hole had been made in No. 18, the contrary side to Messrs. Huntley, and all the drawers and cupboards had been broken open- I went to the Mansion-house, and saw some watch-movements, spoons, and gold seals, which I knew had been safe on Saturday evening; I had had the gold seals in myhand - there were several watch-movements which had come from the workmen, and were not put into cases, but were in drawers on the counter; they all appeared to have been swept into a handkerchief, without any degree of care- I can swear these are my property; they had broken into a room up stairs, come down into the shop, and then went into the cellar; the shop had not been broken, but the room up stairs is a workshop, and persons work there; clocks are cleaned there in general; I can swear the whole was safe on Saturday evening.

            . I only know that I saw the hole through which it is supposed they entered.

                  WILLIAM MORGAN
               



            . I took the prisoner in Sweeting's-alley, and these spoons and watch-movements fell from him - the seals were in his waistcoat pocket.

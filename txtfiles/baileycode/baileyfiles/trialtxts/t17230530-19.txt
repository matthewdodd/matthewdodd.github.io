                     John 
                     Hayward 
                  




                
            , the 25th of May
 last. The Prosecutor depos'd, That having been inform'd by his Servant, that she had seen the Prisoner the Night before this Fact, put his Hand into the Money Box, he having before miss'd Money, was resolved to try an Experiment, therefore he put 40 s. into the Draw in the Shop, having mark'd the Money, and desired a Neighbour, who was a Constable, to watch him that Night, and also another Person. That the next Night, when the Shop was shut, the Prisoner came and ask'd for a Quart of Brandy, which being to be fetch'd out of the Cellar, while the Boy was gone down to draw the Brandy, he took the Opportunity to take the Money out of the Box. Charnock Hayward depos'd, That he being upon the Stairs, did, through the Banisters of the Stair-Case, see the Prisoner, while the Boy was gone down to draw the Brandy, open the Money Box, and take out Money. The Constable depos'd, That he being on the Stairs did see the Prisoner go behind the Counter and take the Money out of the Till, that thereupon he came down immediately and siez'd him, and took 12 Shillings out of his Pocket, and that upon examining the Draw, there was just 28 Shillings left in it, wanting just the 12 Shillings that was found upon him. The Prosecutor depos'd, that these Shillings so taken upon the Prisoner, were those that he had mark'd on purpose to make the Experiment. The Prisoner however deny'd the Fact. But the Fact being too plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Felony.

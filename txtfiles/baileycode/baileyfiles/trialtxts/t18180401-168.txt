            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Hiscock, of North Audley-street. I saw a little boy take the handkerchief out of Mr. Reid's pocket, and give it to the prisoner, who put it into his hat - He was close to the boy - I went and told Mr. Reid. The prisoner, and another person, who was with him, went up Gee-court; they separated, and met again at the corner. Mr. Reid called out Stop thief! a man stopped the prisoner, and found the handkerchief in his hat.

            . I have the care of a shop, belonging to

             - he is a poulterer
. On the 10th of October I placed a number of fowls in the window, and at noon I missed one; shortly afterwards a fowl was brought back, which I believe was the same; there was one missing which had been in its right place half an hour before.

            . I am a musician. I was on the opposite side of the way; the two prisoners went past the shop - there was an officer at the corner of Wardour-street- I saw Thomas Brown go and take a fowl, and go to George-street; he then put it into his apron - I followed him, and brought him back with it to the shop; the officer had got the other prisoner there - George was standing looking at Thomas while he took it.

George Brown's Defence. I was not with this boy - I saw him brought in; a gentleman took me by the arm and said it was for stealing a fowl, but I know nothing of it.
Thomas Brown's Defence. He was not with me - I know nothing of him

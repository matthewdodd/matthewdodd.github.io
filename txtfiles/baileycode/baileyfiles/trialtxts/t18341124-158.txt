CHARLES HENEY FALCONER
. I am a Thames-police surveyor. On the 17th of November I fell in with the prisoner in Grosvenor-market, Hanover-square, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—he was carrying a bundle—I asked him what it contained—he said he did not well know—that he had picked it up in the street—I opened it, and found in it five pint pots, and one quart—my brother officer afterwards found a pot in the prisoner's hat.






JOHN GASKIN
. I was with Falconer—I found this other pot in the prisoner's hat—he said he picked it up at Hyde-park-corner, with the basket.

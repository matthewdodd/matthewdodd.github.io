            . I am in partnership with

             - we are jewellers

, and live in Red Lion street, Clerkenwell


. The prisoner came into our service on the 3d of May; we do not keep an open shop. On taking stock on the 23d of June we missed three seals among a great deal of other property; they were gold seals, and had been kept in a drawer in the warehouse. We found them in pawn. We can ascertain their description and value by our books.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did Mr. Allanson come into partnership with you - A. On the 1st of April; - it was the prisoner's duty to take out goods, which were given him to dispose of, but none but what were given to him - they were always given to him - he was to shew them round the trade; he had particular directions every morning - and I or my partner always examined the stock he took out - he was only to take such goods as we gave him, and was not authorised to open a fresh account without our knowledge, unless he sold for cash.
Q. Did he not express a desire that the stock should be taken - A. Never, till I told him there were many goods missing, and must have stock taken; he might have replied that he was anxious for it, I cannot tell. He absented himself one day, but returned the next - he continued in our employ till stock was taken, and up to the Saturday following. I told him we should not want his services - I produce his daily sale book - the first entry is dated on the 8th of April, and the last on the 23d of June. I have made a few entries in it myself, having sold some goods. We were two days taking stock - he was absent one of those days - I had told him we should not want him after that week.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you take stock in the regular course of business, or under suspicion that you were robbed - A. Suspecting that we had been robbed, I mentioned these seals to him as having been missed among other things - he gave no account of them. We finished taking stock on Thursday - he came on Friday. I asked him then, and repeatedly to explain about the seals - he gave no explanation. I paid him his wages, and discharged him on Saturday - we were not then sensible of the extent of our loss. He should enter in this book what he had done with the property he took out, I never ordered him to take these seals.
MR. BRODRICK. Q. Here are many entries of seals in this book - A. Yes, but not of those in question. On the day he left he said there was some money he could receive from a person I did not know - I said
"Go and receive it." He returned and said he had not received it, but had lent the man the money to pay me (looking at three seals) these are them - two are worth 46 s. and the other 38 s.

            . I am servant to Mr. Wood, pawnbroker, St. Giles's. On the 17th of June the prisoner pawned these three seals for 2 l., in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  James
               



            .
MR. SPENCER. I had seen these seals a few days before we took stock - I know them by the workmanship.
MR. ALLANSON. I never authorized the prisoner to take out these seals.
Cross-examined. Q. When did the prisoner come into your employ - A. On the 3d of May.
Q. Had you any conversation with him about the partnership - A. Not till a few days before he left us - it was on the night of the 21st of June. I had said nothing to him, but he told me he knew I had borrowed money of my sister to open an account at a banker's, and he insinuated things against my partner - he said if I would look in the books I should find false entries made, and proposed my drawing part of the stock from the concern; and said I might command him in what way I pleased. I did not propose it to him - he said he would take the stock out as usual next day, and sell it as usual, and I would meet him at the Colonial Coffee-house at five o'clock in the evening; and I might enquire in the mean time into what he had said. I never myself desired him to take part of the stock out. I know Saunders - I went with him one day to search a house near the Cobourg Theatre, after the prisoner was in custody. I never told him I had engagedwith the prisoner to take away the most valuable part of the stock, to compel Spencer to dissolve the partnership, or any thing of the kind. I might have said I had agreed to meet him at the coffee-house, as it was publicly known then. I told him the prisoner was to wait me at the coffee-house with the stock which he had taken out to sell - he had advised me to secure the stock - I said I would consider of what he had said, and would meet him there. My partner had sent him out with the stock as well as myself. I related the circumstances to Saunders in the way I have stated.
Q. Did you tell him you had agreed to the proposition - A. I do not think that I did - I will not swear it. I called at the Colonial Coffee-house, and he was not there. I left word for him to stop, intending to call in half an hour, but did not. My father was going that way; I desired him to call and send him home. My father saw him safe into the house, and then left. I never expressed a dissatisfaction about the partnership, except from what he insinuated. I had no conversation with him at any other time about it.
Q. Did you draw any money out of the banker's on a particular account - A. Only to pay the partnership accounts. He was absent one day while we were taking stock. Mr. Spencer told him to come at nine o'clock, but he did not; he came next day, in consequence of my going to him.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. How did you meet with Saunders - A. He came to me, at our house in Red Lion-street, in consequence of my calling at his mother's; he had been in our service in May; we sent for him, thinking he might give some information about the property. I never entertained the least doubt of my partner's fidelity till the 21st of June, when the prisoner suggested this to me; he suggested every thing to me. I appeared to acquiesce, but formed no opinion about it, wishing to inquire further; I only told him to take the stock out as usual. I told Mr. Spencer what had passed on the Thursday; after the stock came home. My sister demanded the money she had 1 nt, and I withdrew it.
COURT. Q. What stock did he bring home on Thursday - A. I do not know, my Lord, it was more than usual.

            . I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th, in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. I found seven or eight sovereigns on him. He said he knew there was a quantity of property missing, and he could explain it.
Mr. BRODRICK to MR. SPENCER. Q. Is there any thing in these seals to enable you to distinguish them from others of the same pattern - A. They are of a particular pattern; they were in a private drawer in the warehouse.
Prisoner's Defence. When I first entered their service, I supposed I was to do the out-door business alone; I was to have thirty shillings a week at first, which was to be increased as I sold more goods. When I went on Monday, to my surprise a youth named Saunders was there to be employed in the same way at half my salary. I found from my first day's business that there was not enough employment for me, and saw this youth was there to supplant me, when I had formed a connection. It may he said I have made false entries in my book. I have done so, but I have paid the money for the goods, which my book will prove, and their cash book also, which is the case with these three seals. Saunders sold a good many seals; I entered these and paid for them. Not wishing him to get the connexion. I saw these three seals in the warehouse, and told Mr. Spencer I wanted them to shew with others. There was never an account taken of what I took out after the first fortnight; I was authorized to take any articles which I could sell, I was very unsuccessful on that day, and entered these seals - two to Mr. Rossery, and one to Campbell; fearing Saunders would do more than me, I entered Campbell's as paid, and paid for it myself, and entered Rossery payable on a certain day, and paid it myself on that day.
MR. SPENCER. Here is on cash-book. The prisoner has entered in his book
"One seal 17th, 42 s., and one 34 s.," making 3 l. 16 d., discount 3 s. 3 d., paid - Campbell one seal, 34 s., discount 2 s., 1 l. 12 s., paid." We received the cash for these entries, but these are not the seals in question, and the seals he states he had from the warehouse was on the 18th; this entry is on the 17th. I am quite certain that it relates to quite different seals.
MR. BRODRICK. Q. How can you tell they are not the same seals - A. The price is very different, and these are three which were given to him, and accounted for, and of a different pattern. The price tells the pattern. Here is an entry in the cash-book of 1 l. 12 s. received from Campbell, on the 17th, and 3 l. 12 s. from Rossery, on the 22 d.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have the seals ever been delivered out of your stock to be offered for sale - A. Never; they are of quite a different price.
COURT. Q. Are your seals ticketed with the prices when you deliver them to him for sale - A. Yes, unless it is a common pattern, which he would have a sufficient knowledge of. I recollect his asking for the seals, which he has entered perfectly well - he did not usually take out seals, but he said he had a customer, and I gave him three, which he returned, as sold to Rossery and Campbell.
- ROSSERY. Q. Did the prisoner sell any seals to you on the 17th of June - A. No.

            . I entered the prosecutor's service on the same day as the prisoner. The goods were selected for him at first, but he afterwards took what he thought proper - he entered them on a slate, and in the evening accounted for them. I left on the 24th of May. I checked his accounts every night. On the 1st of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning I had some conversation with Mr. Allanson, on Blackfriars-bridge; he said he had agreed with the prisoner to take out the best part of the goods by stratagem, and he was to meet him at the Colonial coffee-house at five o'clock that evening, and the goods were to be detained, to make Mr. Spencer settle accounts; he said he had taken legal advice on the subject. He said he went to the coffee-house, but did not meet Fidler.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you lived with any one since you left the prosecutors - A. No. I know the conversation was on the 1st of July, by a memorandum I have, of having been there on that day to cast up their books.
Q. How came you to leave the prosecutors - A. Mr.Spencer told me on Saturday evening that he had no further occasion for my services.

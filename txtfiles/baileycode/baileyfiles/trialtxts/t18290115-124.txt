                  , from the person of

            . I am the daughter of Mary Thacker - she is a widow
, and lives in Hoxton


. On the 5th of December, I was carrying a bundle of my mother's, containing silk handkerchiefs, night-caps, and other things - the prisoner met me, and snatched them from me; the things fell out of the bundle - he carried away two silk handkerchiefs, and an apron, and made his escape - I had seen him several times before, but had never spoken to him, nor he to me: I am sure he is the person.

            . I am the witness's brother: she told me, when I went home, that these things had been taken - I knew the prisoner before, and had spoken to him, but he was no friend of mine; I met him in Shoreditch, and accused him of the robbery - he denied it; I asked him to come to my mother's - he came to the door, and then ran away; he is a butcher
.

            . I live at Hoxton. On the 5th of December, I saw this young woman with a bundle, coming along; I saw the prisoner go and take it - most of the things dropped, but some remained in his hands, and he ran away with them; I had seen him before about the town.
Prisoner's Defence. It was in a dark place, and this witness owes me a grudge; he gets his living by stealing dogs, and selling them at the Exchange.

            . No, I do not - I can get a good character from the Robinhood public-house, and from the master I last lived with.

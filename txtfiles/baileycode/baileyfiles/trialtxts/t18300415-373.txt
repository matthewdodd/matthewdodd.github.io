EDWARD CORKER. I am a gentleman's coachman. On the 7th of April I was down Crutched-friars


, and saw a gentleman and two ladies arm-in-arm - I saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket; he had it in his hand - the gentleman ran after him, called Stop thief! and another gentleman stopped him; the officer took him into custody - I did not know the gentleman.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner- I saw him run up Crutched-friars; a gentleman pursued him, and threw an umbrella at him - the gentleman would not give his address; this is the handkerchief - the prisoner threw it away, and said he did not take it.

            . I lost two cramps, two chissels, and a pretty many other irons: the prisoner was servant
 to me.
Q. Why do you charge him?
Lawrance. He was taken up on suspicionand be confessed the taking them before justice Withers: he owned he took all the things mentioned in the indictment, except one piece, which he said was not mine.
Q. Have you seen the goods again ?
Lawrance. Yes, he was stopped at Shoreditch, and put into the watch-house: he had the things all upon him then.

            . I was constable of the night : the watchman went home with some people, and as he was returning, he light of this man at the bar, and brought him into the watch-house to me; he had a sack with the things in it on his shoulder: (the sack and irons were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor; and the constable deposed they were found upon the prisoner.)
Q. What time was the prisoner brought in?
Ash. It was between eleven and twelve o'clock on a Sunday night.
Prisoner's Defence.
I lived thirteen years at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire: the things I carried into the watch-house were never in his shop.
Q. to prosecutor. Were these goods in your shop?
Prosecutor. They were before they were taken away.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who deposed they had known him many years, and gave him a good character.

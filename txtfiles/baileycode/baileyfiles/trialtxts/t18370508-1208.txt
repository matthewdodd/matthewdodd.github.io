ROBERT YOUNG
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of April, 1 pair of scales, value 6s., the goods of 



Stephen Jacobs; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






STEPHEN JACOBS
. I live in North-place, Hampstead-road, and keep a chandler's shop. I missed a pair of scales off the counter, about half-past four o'clock—these are mice—I know them by the chains and the crack where the wires go in.





JOHN EATON
. I was in Tottenham Court-road, on the 3rd of April, at twenty minutes before three o'clock—I saw the prisoner, and took him from information—I found these scales on him.

Prisoner. I picked them up in Hampstead-road, tied with a piece of twine.





JAMES ROGERS
 (police-sergeant S 7.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's for conviction (read)—I know the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a collecting-clerk
 to Messrs. Wyatts, brewers. On the 27th of April, about ten o'clock at night, I was at the end of Gray's Inn-lane, Holborn


, and felt a snatch at my coat - I turned round and missed my handkerchief. I saw two men standing close to me and I laid hold of one, who was the prisoner - the other went away. The prisoner was wiping his face with a handkerchief - I took it out of his hand, but it was not mine - he denied knowing anything of mine. I took him to the watch-house, and nothing was found on him. He was moved to Eagle-street watch-house, where a purse, containing two 1 l. notes was found on him. He said nothing about the other man.

            . I am a constable. I was going down Gray's Inn-lane, and saw three or four men, whom I knew, following the prosecutor. The prisoner was one. I saw him take the handkerchief out of his pocket and give it to the other immediately. I pursued, but lost the others. I saw Blew take the prisoner.

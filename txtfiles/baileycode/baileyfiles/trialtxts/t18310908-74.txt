WILLIAM HENRY WHITEHEAD. I am a solicitor

, to Serle-street


, about a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th of July; my nephew, who was with me, told me my handkerchief was taken -I turned and found it on the ground in a corner, where it could not have dropped; it had been in my pocket - the prisoner, who was close behind me, was pointed out, and I called an officer.

            . I was walking a little behind my uncle, and saw the prisoner put his hand into the pocket and pull the handkerchief out; I told my uncle immediately - the prisoner put the handkerchief into his pocket, but when I told my uncle he took it out, and threw it on the ground.(Property produced and sworn to.)

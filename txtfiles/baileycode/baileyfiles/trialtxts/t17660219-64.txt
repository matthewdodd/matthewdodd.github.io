            . I am a publican
 on Snow-hill, the prisoner lived servant
 with me some time in December last: I missed a watch and great coat; the prisoner went away from me. He is a drum and fife in the militia
: the captain's servant came to know where he was, and said he had got a pretty watch; then I, mistrusting it to be mine, had him taken up; he confessed he had taken it, and pawned it in Cowcross, where I found it. I never could hear of my coat.

            . I am a pawnbroker, this watch was pawned at my house in the name of 
               
                  George 
                  Robinson 
               



            ; but the person that took it in, is very ill, and not able to attend (produced and deposed to).
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

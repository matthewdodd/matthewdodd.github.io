ELIZABETH BOYCE
. I am the wife of Francis Scott Boyce, butcher, of High-street, Hoxton. I saw a leg of pork on the show-board a short time before it was taken—I have seen it since, and am sure it is the same—it is my husband's properety.





THOMAS ZINZAN
 (policeman.) On 16th, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners in company near Mr. Boyce's shop—I watched, and saw Purman go up to the show-board, take the pork, roll it up in his apron, and give it to Page to carry—Purman ran into the next street and Page after him.

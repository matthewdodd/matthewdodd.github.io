            . I am coachman to Mrs. Deborah Dixon, widow; I drove the Henley coach for her from there to London. On the 3d of November, I stopped with the coach at some private stables at Hounslow


, which she rents of Stuckbury; before I changed horses I saw the prisoner at the back of the stable; I got off my coach, and went round to the back stable - I had seen the prisoner there before, and desired him not to remain there - it is a private yard: we have two rest-horses and a corn-bin in the back stable; I saw the prisoner go to the bin, and fill a bag, which he hid under the dunghill - he did not see me; I went up, and said, "Mr. Ward, what have you got there?" he said, "D - n it, here is a great rat;" he took up a brick, and ran round the stable; I went after him, but he crossed the field, and ran away; I went to the dung-heap, and found this corn in the bag - it is called horse-corn; all the corn there belongs to Mrs. Dixon - here is nearly a bushel of it.
Prisoner's Defence. I was never in the stable; I found it under the granary, and threw it on the ground.

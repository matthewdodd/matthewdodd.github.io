, the 9th of June I lost six iron bars, and one iron door; they were taken out of a room, the bars were fixed to the brick-work , and the door was hung on hinges, they were lost between five and six; they were found since on Saffron-hill; the prisoner had worked for me once before.

             sworn.
I produce the iron bars; when I took the prisoner, he told me he had sold them: I told him it was a pity to rob poor people like them, if he had robbed rich people it would not have been so bad; and he carried me to the shop on Saffron-hill, where he sold them. These are them.
(Produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
When Mr. Blackey took me, I never said a word to him, I never had anything to do with them.

            . I live with George Eadie, a publican
, of Little George-street, Bedford-row


. These boots were on a shelf on the kitchen stairs. On the 18th of November the prisoner and another person came in, and had liquor and porter, and about two o'clock the other went down stairs, and came up again. The prisoner then went down; I had some suspicion, as I had seen them there a fortnight before, and told mistress of it - I then heard a rush out at the door; I directly looked, and missed the boots; I went out, and saw the prisoner running with them - he threw them away and I stopped him, without losing sight of him.

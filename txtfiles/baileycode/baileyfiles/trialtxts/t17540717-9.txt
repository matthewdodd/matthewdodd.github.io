            , (he produced a stock-vice.) This was taken out of my shop in Codpiss-Row, Clerkenwell


, on the 9th of June. I advertised it at a crown reward, and by that means found it was pawned in the name of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Mooney 
               



             and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Smith 
               



            , and the pawnbroker came and told me he had it. I took the prisoner up, and going to the justice's he confessed taking it to the constable and I.
Q. What is the value of it?


                  William 
                  Redbourn 
               



            . I value it at 7 s.


                  Ann 
                  Smith 
               



            . I went along with the prisoner to the pawnbroker's with the vice, and pawned it there. He told me it was his own.
Mr. Bembrick. I believe it is the prisoner that came with this woman to pawn this vice. I took it in, knowing the woman. I found it advertised, and gave notice to the prosecutor.
Prisoner's defence.
On Sunday morning I went to call my fellow servants to take a walk to Islington. I went to a little back place to case myself; I found this vice, and I carried it to an alehouse till the next day, then I went and pawned it with that woman.

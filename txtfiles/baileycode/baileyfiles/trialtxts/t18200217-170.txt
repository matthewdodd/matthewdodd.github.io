            . I locked the tools up in the tool-house; next morning, about seven o'clock, I found the door forced open, and the cowhouse also forced open. I found the property at the office, and the prisoner in custody. He lives in our neighbourhood.

            . I am foreman to

                  Levy
               



            , who keeps a saleshop in the Borough-road. On the 19th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop, with the barrow and other articles; he asked 6 s. for them, which made me suspect him. I asked him if he was a gardener? he said he was, and lived at Lambeth. I gave him in charge.

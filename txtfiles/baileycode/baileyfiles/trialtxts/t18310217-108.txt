            . I am a carpenter. On the 17th of November

 I went to the Golden Cans, public-house, at the corner of Laystall-street and Tothill-street, Westminster



, about a quarter before nine o'clock - I saw the two prisoners there; Perkins went by the name of 
               
                  Charles 
                  Green
               



             - I was introduced to them then; I had never seen them before - I went out with Cartwright to purchase some counterfeit coin of him; when I went in, Barnes spoke to Perkins, and he nodded to me to stop there - Perkins then came up to me, and said he did not serve himself, but as he had a knowledge of the person who had introduced me, his partner Cartwright should serve me; Perkins, who called himself Green, then produced a bag, which he gave to Cartwright when I was in the passage - Cartwright and I then went on to the corner of the street, under the bar-window; he there asked me what coin I wanted - I said six half-crowns, and he gave them to me out of the bag which had been given him by Perkins, and I gave him 6s. for them, which I had received from Gollocker; the bag contained more money - I saw more half-crowns in it; when I had given Cartwright the 6s., Perkins came up, and said he ran quite risk enough by making them, without selling them to a person he had no knowledge of; Cartwright gave him the 6s. - after this transaction was finished, I went to Gollocker at the Red Lion, in Fleet-street; Myers went with me - he had been standing in Laystall-street, and I believe saw me deal; I could see him at the time - I marked the counterfeit half-crowns at the Red Lion, and gave them to Myers; Cartwright said that if neither he nor Perkins were at the Golden Cans, I might ask the waiter, who would find them - I did not know where they lived.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you evergo to the waiter at the Golden Cans? A. No - I am very seldom without business; I have two or three notes in my pocket now - I did not bring them for any purpose; I have known Myers two years or better - he was an officer when I first knew him; he first employed me in jobs of this kind last summer, in the case of McCarthy - I was then in business as a carpenter, and had not much time to spare, but I considered it my public duty to undertake such a job; it was from principle and duty, but I expected to be paid for my loss of time - I do not consider I was paid enough; I believe I got between 4l. and 5l. in McCarthy's case - I was very well satisfied; these cases are the next I have had - I have not looked for any other; I do not know whether I expect as much for each of these cases as I had in McCarthy's - I do not know that it depends on their conviction, or acquittal; I value my time at 4s. 6d. a day - I have got 5s. 6d.; I think the Mint paid me 4s. 6d. a day in McCarthy's case, but I do not recollect.
JURY. Q. Did Myers see you in the passage? A. Yes, he was standing in the street.

                  MYERS
               



            . I am a tobacconist, and was for ten years a constable. I know Birt, and employed him to assist me in this business - he receives no remuneration but for his loss of time; no bargain is made with him that I know of - on the 17th of November, an appointment was made to meet him and Barnes at the Red Lion, in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street; we met soon after eight o'clock in the evening - I searched Birt, and found nothing on him; he was then furnished with six good shillings - I then went with him and Barnes to the Three Golden Cans, in Laystall-street; we got there a little before nine o'clock - Barnes went into the house first, then Birt, and I took my station at a house opposite; in a short time I saw Birt come out, and stand with his back against the bar-window - he had not been there more than two or three minutes, I should think, when Cartwright came out, and stood immediately opposite him, with one foot on the curb and one off; Perkins then came out, and stood on the right of Cartwright - directly upon that Cartwright took something from his pocket, and put it into Birt's hands; Birt opened his hand and counted it, to give me, I suppose, an opportunity of seeing what it was, and I saw some large pieces of money, as there was a strong gas-lamp over them - the clock was striking nine at the time; the street is narrow, and I was opposite them, at a private house, elevated on a step - Birt then gave Cartwright something, and Perkins held his hand out and took it; he held his hand open, and turned it over, as if looking at it - he then turned round, went into the Golden Cans, and Cartwright followed him; Birt then came across to me, and gave me six half-crowns - that was directly after Cartwright had left him, and gone round the corner into the public-house; Birt gave them to me from the same hand that I saw him receive them in - I never lost sight of him; he had no money about him before, except what I gave him - these are the six half-crowns; I did not take the prisoners then, because we had others to take - the prisoner Cartwright was taken on the 15th of January, and then we went back again; Perkins came in, and was taken - I did not take either of them; I was waiting in Tothill-street, in case they should get away backwards.
Cross-examined. Q. Had you marked the six shillings? A. No, Sir; Birt was a respectable man; but I searched him, to satisfy the Jury that he had nothing; I can now swear more correctly that he had nothing - I do not know whether it is a licensed public-house or not; I am not in the habit of going to that end of the town- I have known Birt between two and three years; I have been employed by the Mint eight or nine years - I am not paid by the year or the month; I am paid for my loss of time - I sometimes get a crown a day, and sometimes less; I am paid according to the number of days I am employed -I employed Birt on McCarthy's case, but I did not pay him - he is paid by the Mint; I was an officer of Surrey for ten years- I did not belong to Union-hall; I was a parish constable, from year to year - I never was accused of letting a prisoner escape for the sum of 5l.; I am a tobacconist, and live on Newington-causeway - the house is my own, and six or seven others; I work for the Mint because I think it is my duty - I would not lose my time for government without being paid for it; I do not know how much I have received of the Mint in the last twelve months - perhaps 20l. or 30l., and I have been out for weeks and weeks about it; I will swear I have not received 200l. or 300l.; if I had my books here I could tell - I always make a minute of what takes place.

                  GOLLOCKER
               



            . I am a constable of Lambeth. I went on the 15th of January to the three Golden Cans, in Tothill-street, to take the prisoners; Myers, Hall, Lee, and Dunn, were with me - I stopped in Laystall-street till I thought the transaction was over; I then went to the Golden Cans, brushed into the house, and caught Cartwright's hand - he had twenty-four half-crowns in it; I caught hold of his wrist, and turned the half-crowns over into my own hand; Birt was then in the passage, just by the bar door - I marked the half-crowns, and gave them to Lee; I did not see Perkins at that time.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Barnes? A. Yes; we wished him to be here, in case there should be any thing particular asked us - he did not come with us; this was in the passage of the public-house - the landlady was in the bar.


                  WILLIAM 
                  LEE
               



            . I am a constable of Hatton-garden. I assisted in taking Cartwright, at the Golden Cans; I saw him standing at the door, talking to Birt - we rushed over, and Gollocker took twenty-four half-crowns out of his hand, which he marked in my presence, and handed over to me - I did not see them in Cartwright's hand, but I saw them taken from his hand.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Barnes? A. I saw him for the first time on the 15th of January - I do not know that he has been convicted of robbing the East India-house.


                  THOMAS 
                  DUNN
               



            . I am a constable of Lambeth. Myers asked me to go with them on the 15th of January - I went, and saw Cartwright drop a parcel of base coin into one of the officer's hands, one of them dropped down; one of the party said Perkins (calling him by the name of Green) was in the tap-room - I went in, and asked him if his name was Green; he said I was mistaken, he was not the party- I ran into the passage to get one of the officers, and when I returned he had fled away; I returned, and we took Cartwright - soon afterwards Perkins came in, and was taken; I think he had changed his waistcoat - I knownothing of that public-house; it was the first time I had been there - there were a parcel of bad women and bad characters there.
Cross-examined. Q. You would know a bad character if you saw one? A. I am in the habit of seeing a great many - I am not acquainted with Barnes; I believe he was there on the 15th of January, but I do not know that I should know him; I think the waistcoat Perkins had on at first was a light colour - there seemed an alteration; he came back to the same spot, when he thought we were gone; I found thirteen penny-pieces and an old rag on him - I should imagine the public-house is licensed; there was a man playing a violin, and some low characters seemed to be dancing - the landlady was in the bar; I do not know whether she saw the transaction.

            . These are all counterfeit, and the same metal as the others.

            . Q. From what part of his person did Cartwright get the half-crowns? A. Apparently from his middle; I stood on the step of a door directly opposite.
Perkins put in a written defence, declaring that he had nothing whatever to do with the transaction, that he had merely gone into the Golden Cans for some beer, and was apprehended.

                  BIRT
               



            . I met the two prisoners on the 1st of January, at the Three Golden Cans; I went into the taproom, and they pointed for me to go to the street door -Perkins there asked me how I got on; I said, "Very well;" he said I did not do many of them, meaning the counterfeit coin, which I had purchased of him - I got eight more half-crowns of Cartwright, who stood in the doorway; Perkins stood between the bar door and the street door - he handed them to Cartwright to give me, and I gave him 8s. for them, which I had got from Gollocker, at the Red Lion, in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street, about twenty minutes before - I had no other money, good or bad; I did not stay above three or four minutes with the prisoners - I then went to the Red Lion, marked the bad money, and gave it to Gollocker; at the time I bought these half-crowns of the prisoners, Gollocker stood opposite, in Laystall-street - Cartwright saw him, and asked if he was any one belonging to me; I said Yes, he was a friend of mine.
Perkins. Q. What time did you come there? A. At a quarter after seven o'clock - I saw you inside the door with Cartwright - you gave him the eight half-crowns as he was on the cill of the door; I then crossed to Gollocker, and we went to the Red Lion - you went towards the taproom; I do not know whether you went in - when Cartwright gave me the money I went into the street.


                  JAMES 
                  GOLLOCKER
               



            . I accompanied Birt, and stood opposite, under a gas-lamp - I had searched Birt before, to throw every doubt aside, and he had no money, bad or good, but what we gave him - he was not out of my sight, but just when he went within the door; he then came to the door, and I saw Cartwright give eight large pieces of money into his hand, and he gave Cartwright some money in return; Birt then came over to me with the half-crowns, and we took them to Poppin's-court.


                  RICHARD 
                  MYERS
               



            . I was in a court opposite the public-house - I saw Birt and Cartwright standing inside the door, on the threshold, and I saw another man behind, but I could not distinguish Perkins' face; I saw their hands going together, and directly the dealing was over, Birt came over, and gave the eight half-crowns to Gollocker - we went away: we took the prisoners on the 15th of January.
Perkins. Q. How was the door? A. It was shut when you were inside with him - when you dealt you were between the street door and the swing door - I was in a court which has a baker's-shop at one corner of it; I stated on a former occasion that they were half-crowns - you were under a gas-lamp, and I could see you distinctly.


                  JOHN 
                  FIELD
               



            . These eight half-crowns are all counterfeit, and the same as the rest.

DANIEL SINFIELD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of September, 1 coat, value 20s., the goods of 



John Walters,.






FREDERICK MIZEN
/. I live in St. John-street-road. Last Friday evening, at a quarter past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner running in St, John-street-road, with a coat in his arms, and a mob after him—he dropped it just by me, rushed by me, and shoved me off the pavement, saying, "Get out of the way"—I pursued and collared him, and held him two minutes, till a policeman came—the coat was brought and given to me—I gave him to the policeman, with the coat.

Prisoner. He never saw it in my hand—he had the coat himself, and when he saw me running after him, he turned round, and caught hold of me, and threw the coat down. Witness. That is not so.





HENRY HASE
/. I am in the service of John Walters, a pawnbroker in Goswell-road—this coat is my master's, and was hanging on a railing near the door for sale—there was a boy outside to watch the goods—the prisoner said before the Magistrate that Mizen was the thief, but not before.





JAMES DAVIS
/. I am a policeman. I was crossing St. John-street-road and Mizen delivered the prisoner and the coat into my hands, saying it was stolen—Hase came up soon after, and claimed it—the prisoner did not say Mizen stole the coat till he got to the office—he was taken nearly a quarter of a mile from where he stole the coat, as he ran a round-about direction—I saw Mizen collar him, but did not see him run.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

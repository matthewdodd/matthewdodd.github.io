The prisoner was servant
 to the prosecutrix, and the keys of her drawers were missing. A Smith was fetch'd with some keys, the drawer was open'd, and the things mentioned in the indictment taken from out of a box in the drawer. The prisoner was charged with taking them, who at first denied it; but afterwards acknowledged she had taken the things and that she had changed a crown and a half crown of the money; she brought all the goods again but one pair of buttons.

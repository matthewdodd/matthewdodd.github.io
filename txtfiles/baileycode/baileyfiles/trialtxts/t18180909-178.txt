            . I am a carpenter
. On the 25th of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I was locked out of my lodgings. I met the prisoner Shellon in Holborn, and went to Charles-street, Drury-lane


 with her. Next morning when I got up I missed the articles stated in the indictment. Just as I awoke I saw her and a man leaving the room, I ran out and overtook the prisoners together. I took the bundle from Shellon. I found Sullivan had got my shoes and stockings on.

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor brought the prisoners to the watch-house. I found his shoes and stockings on Sullivan. He was wearing them.

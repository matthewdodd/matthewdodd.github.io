GEORGE SAINSBURY
. Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 16th of September, I went to sleep in the fields, at Barnsbury-park, Islington, I had three half-crowns, and twopence, in my pocket—I was awoke, and missed my money—I went to the prisoner, and charged her with it—she said she had not got it—I followed her, and saw her drop ray purse down, it had two penny pieces in it, but the half-crowns were gone—I asked her whether she had got them—she said, "No"—the gentleman who spoke to me said, "I saw your hand in his pocket twice"—she said, "No"—the gentleman said, "If you do not give it up, we will give you in charge"-as we were going to the watch-house, she pulled out the three half-crowns, and offered them me—I would not take them.

Prisoner. I was sitting down, and you came and gave them to me. Witness. No, I did not; what should I for?






WIILIAM SHELL
 (police-constable N 35.) I saw the prisoner offer the three half-crowns to the prosecutor—she asked me if she could do so, and whether it would be too late—she and the prosecutor were both sober.

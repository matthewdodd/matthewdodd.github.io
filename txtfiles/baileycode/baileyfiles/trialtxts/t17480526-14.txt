                  Irish 
               



            .
Q. Where do you carry on your trade?
Bolus. In the parish of St. Luke's, Middlesex


.
Q. What have you to say against the Prisoners?
Bolus. We had missed yarn frequently.
Q. When did you lose these goods?
Bolus. The first was about three months ago, and the last on the 29th of April.
Q. What did you lose on the 29th of April.
Bolus . Forty-one pounds weight of linen yarn, and it was taken upon two of the Prisoners, Dicker and Palmer.
Q. Where was this yarn taken from?
Bolus. Out of our factory, where we employ a great many people in weaving, spinning, and sailcloth making. [The yarn was produced.]
Q. Is this your yarn?
Bolus. To the best of my knowledge it is, but Mr. Price is a better judge of that than I.
Robert Price. I am in partnership with 
               
                  John 
                  Irish 
               



             and

                  Bolus 
               



            .
Q. Is that your yarn?
Price . Yes, I am sure of it.
Q. How came you by it again?
Price. I was going from St. John's Street to Charter-house Square on the 29th of April, and met 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Dicker 
               



             and Palmer; I let Dicker pass, and she had got a bag upon her head.
Q. What time was this?
Price. About ten in the morning, and I let 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Palmer 
               



             go by me, and she had got a bag upon her head. After she had passed me, I looked at it, and thought it looked like yarn, by the packing of it; I said, Palmer, what have you got there? it seems to me to be yarn, and she was not willing to shew it me; but I took it off her head, and said, I believe it is our yarn; and I said, do you work for any body else? but she did not say any thing. They both worked for me the day before, and that very morning.
Q. You say you seized Palmer, and took the bag off her head?
Price . Yes, and it is our yarn; I can swear to it; and I took the bag from Palmer, and for fear she should make her escape, I called out for help, but no body would take any notice of me.
Q. Did you pursue Dicker?
Price. Yes, and took her. I said I would charge a constable with her; she desired I would let her go back to the factory, and she would carry it there, and she carried it to the factory; I had her before Justice Poulson, and she was committed, and about a week after I took up Palmer.
Q. What have you to say against Brooks?
Price . She said she was in partnership with all of them; I said, Mrs. Brooks, you have used me very ill, in stealing my goods, after I have trusted you with so much, and she acknowledged she had used me very ill.
Q. Did you find any thing upon her?
Price . No, nothing upon her; but she said she would have had her daughter have left it off a great while ago?

Q. Who is her daughter?
Price. 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Dicker 
               



            .
Mr. Harlow. On the 30th of April I was with 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Dicker 
               



             before the Justice.
Q. Are you a constable?
Harlow. No; I am a carpenter, and work at the factory. 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Dicker 
               



             did declare before the Justice, that she did steal goods from Mr. Irish and company, about twenty different times, and sold them to - Dennis and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Lively 
               



            , some at three halfpence a pound, and some at a penny.
Q. What is the value of it?
Price. From ten pence to a shilling a pound. There was some of it the best sort of yarn, and Mrs. Lively said to them, if they would bring her some more of that yarn, she would send it into the country to be made into sheets.


                  Joseph 
                  Dennis 
               



             sworn.
Q. What are you?
Dennis. I was brought up an hostler, but I work for my mother, and she is a ropemaker.
Q. You hear that Dicker says she sold some yarn to you.
Dennis. She sold it to my mother.
Q. How much?
Dennis. About ten or twelve pounds at a time.
Q. Who sold any yarn to your mother?
Dennis. The old woman, Mrs. Brooks, brought it; but I never saw her bring any.
Q. Did Palmer ever bring any?
Dennis. I never saw her in my life.
Q. How many times might Brooks bring yarn?
Dennis. I believe five or six times.
Q. Was there any yarn found at your mother's?
Dennis. Yes.
Q. Who brought the yarn to your mother?
Dennis . The old woman always, her name is Brooks.
Q. What time did she bring the last?
Dennis. I believe it was the 28th or 29th of April, I cannot tell which.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Price.) How do you know this to be your yarn?
Price. I believe it is, but it has undergone an operation since.
Q. What operation?
Price. They have cut a length in two, to fit it for their use.


                  Ann 
                  Lively 
               



            . 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Brooks 
               



             brought ten pounds of yarn to me about two months ago, and I bought it of her; she said she came by it honestly, or I would not have bought it?
Q. Have you any thing more to say?
Lively. No, I have said enough.


                  Thomas 
                  Bolus 
               



            . I beg leave to say one word; Mrs. Brooks, when she was taken, said she had stole, she believed, at different times, three or four hundred weight.


                  Catharine 
                  Dicker 
               



            . The goods were delivered to me to work, and I saved a little out of every parcel.
Q. How came you to do that?
Dicker. I was persuaded to do it by this 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Palmer 
               



            .


                  Q. 
               


            (to Bolus.) Did you deliver your yarn to them to work at their own habitations?
Bolus. We did for about a fortnight, and we had a suspicion that we were robbed of our yarn, and afterwards they worked in our factory; and Dicker said they took it out of our factory.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Palmer.) What have you to say to your advising Dicker to take it?
Palmer. I never advised her to any such thing. Dicker gave it to me to carry for her, as a poor person may do, and she sometimes gave me two pence for carrying it.
Q. Where was you to carry it to?
Palmer. To an alehouse, the corner of Hosier-Lane, and Dicker and Sharpless took it from me.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Bolus.) What quantity was in the two bags?
Bolus. About forty pounds and an half.

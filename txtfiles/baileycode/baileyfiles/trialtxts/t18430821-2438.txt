THOMAS WATSON
. I keep an oil-shop, in Shadwell. I lost a bag containing 28lbs. of shot from my door on the 7th of Aug.—I found it in about five minutes at a door in Albert-street, which is near me—I do not know how it got there.





JAMES HATCH
. I saw the prisoner take the bag from the prosecutor's door—he took it up Albert-street, and threw it at a door—it was too heavy for him to run with—I told the prosecutor, and he went after it.

Prisoner. I was coming home, and a gentleman collared me, and said I had stolen the shot.




GUILTY
.** Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Ship.

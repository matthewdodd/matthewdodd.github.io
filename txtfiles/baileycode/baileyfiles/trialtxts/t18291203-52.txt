GEORGE WILLIAM DEAN. I was foreman to Mr. John Boards, a pawnbroker
, of Shoreditch


. On the evening of the 5th of November I saw some one come and take hold of the handkerchief, and give it a sudden jerk - I thought it was some one going to buy it; I was going round the counter, but he got out, and by the time I got to the door the prisoner had got about six yards off; I overtook him- he was walking fast, and I saw him whisping a handkerchief up, and putting it into his coat; I brought him back, and when I got him about half way he dropped it at his feet; I saw it fall, and at my request a child took it up- I took the prisoner back to the shop, and sent for an officer; while the officer was sent for he said, "I beg your pardon."
GEORGE LAZARUS. I am a patrol. I went to the shop about seven o'clock, and took the prisoner.
JOHN ROBINSON. I produce the handkerchief, which I got from Dean; I saw Lazarus - there was a great mob round - Lazarus said he was afraid to take the prisoner out, and I assisted.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, and he laid hold of me - the handkerchief laid on the ground; he said he saw me drop it, which I did not, and I had no coat on.

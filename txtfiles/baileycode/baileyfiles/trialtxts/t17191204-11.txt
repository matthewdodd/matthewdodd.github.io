             on the 25th of October
 last. The Prosecutor deposed that he lost two Volumes of Tatlers and a Book of Novels, then he lost the third Volume of Tatlers, whereupon he went to Mr. Browne's without Temple-Bar, and finding that the Prisoner had sold the two Volumes there, he told them that they would soon catch the Thief, for he had just lost the third Volume, and he concluded that would be brought to the two first, which was accordingly done, and the Prisoner secur'd. The Books were produc'd in Court, and swore to be bought of the Prisoner, and own'd by the Prosecutor. The Prisoner in his Defence said that he bought them of a Man in Moor-fields, but produc'd none to prove it, nor any to his Reputation. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

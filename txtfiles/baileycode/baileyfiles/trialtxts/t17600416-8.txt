            . I live in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden


, and the prisoner was my servant
. On the 26th of March last I had been out. When I returned home (about twelve o'clock) my servant, the prisoner, brought me a pair of slippers, and my fillet, to put on my head as usual. I pull'd off my cloaths, and put on an old coat that I wore to dress myself in. I went to bed, and ordered him to call me between seven and eight in the morning. He went out of the room. I slept the whole night. In the morning (I was between sleep and awake) my door opened ( this was I believe soon after seven.) I said, who is there? The prisoner said, "Sir, it is me, for God's sake get up, for I
"believe the house has been broke open to night,
"for when I went down stairs this morning I
"found the street door a-jar, and all the drawers
"in the buroe in the parlour open and empty;
"for God's sake get up, for I am afraid to go
"down into the kitchen." I said, in a surprise, good God! I am astonished. In the interim I believe the maid servant came into my room. I slip'd on my breeches and slippers, and went down stairs. I saw the entry door and another door both open. I went into the fore parlour, and all the drawers there were open, except one in the chest of drawers, three out of the four were open; there is an escritore and chest of drawers. I immediately went down into the kitchen along with the prisoner, and by that time the maid was come down stairs; there I saw a trunk that belongs to my maid turn'd on the side, with all her things scattered round it, and it was perfectly empty.
Q. What servants had you?
Smith. Only a maid servant and the prisoner. As there was but little light in the kitchen. I desired the window might be opened, and I immediately perceived the glass part of the window was not shut at all; there is no outside shutter. only a wooden shutter in the inside, and a bar; the window frame was put back, and in the area I saw a considerable number of chips, and as I was above the area I could cast my eye all over it: I saw the groves of the shutter had been cut away, and chip'd to the length of about three feet and a half, and the bar that goes across the window had some scratches on the middle of it, which seem'd to be done by attempting to raise it out of the groove that it was in. Then I went upstairs into the back parlour, and beginning to find myself cold, I said, William, give me my coat and waistcoat to put on. He went into my back parlour, where he usually laid my cloaths after he had given me my old coat to put on, and said, "Sir, there is no
"coat here, for they have taken your coat and
"waistcoat that you had on last night." I saw my case of instruments, plaister case, and papers lying on the table. I desired him to go up into a room, and fetch me a coat from thence, saying, he would find an olive-colour coat there; it is a room joining to the room where I lie. He went upstairs, came down again, and said,
"Sir, there is no coat
"there, they may have been up in that room too,
"for they have not left a coat there, nor nothing
"like it." When he was gone upstairs, I went to look about the fore parlour, and in the desk part of the buroe, I saw there had been an attempt made to open that; but I imagined it had not been open'd, because I saw part of a key was broke in the lock. I put my hand to the lid, and could not pull it up. I had the key in my pocket, and opened the glass part of it, to see if some papers of considerable value there were safe, belonging to a gentleman that is gone to Germany, and I found them all safe. Had they been gone, it must inevitably have been my ruin. There were two pieces of key broke in the opening part of the escritore; two drawers were constantly kept unlocked, one having my shirts in it, which the maid servant had the care of, and the other my silk and other stockings and handkerchiefs, which the prisoner had the care of; the upper part had not been opened at all. I found my silk stockings, handkerchiefs, and several shirts were gone. After this, he telling me there was never a coat for me, I desired he would go to Mr. Langford, the auctioneer, and desire his son to lend me a coat and waistcoat. He came back again, and told me he was not at home. Then I went to the Rainbow coffee-house, and he came in. I told him the case. He said, have you any reason to suspect your servants? I said, no, neither my maid nor my man. I had a good character with my man.
Q. How long had he lived with you?
Smith. He had lived with me about three months. I desired the prisoner not to mention any thing of this robbery till I returned from Mr. Fielding's, and to look about while I was gone, to see what more was missing. I went to Mr. Fielding, and told him what had happened. He desired me to ask many questions of each of my servants. I told him I had no reason to suspect either of them, but if he pleased they should both come to him, that he might take their depositions, relating to the condition they found the house in when they got up.
Q. How long has your maid lived with you?
Smith. She has lived with me about two years. Mr. Fielding took down the account I gave him; I sent for my two servants, I do not now recollect which of them I sent for first, but they both made their depositions in the same manner they had related it to me; both sign'd and swore to it. I went home, after I had heard what each of them said, much better satisfied of their honestly than before. Then I sat down and made an inventory of the things that I had lost, by asking my man after such and such things, and as he said they were missing I put them down as lost. Then I sent it to Mr. Fielding's, to be inserted in the Public Advertiser the next day; and as he had mentioned some Jews that buy wearing apparel that are stolen, I desired that he'd send out people to search after the things, and that I would grudge no expence. They were inserted in the Wednesday's paper following, and I ordered hand bills also to be delivered about. I was obliged to send for my taylor, to make me another suit of cloaths, having appeared about town in a borrowed coat and waistcoat, which cloaths came home in the evening on the 1st of April. While I was dressing myself on the Wednesday, which was the 2d. I said, William, as the cloaths I am going to put on are not mourning, I think I have a pair of crystal buttons set in silver somewhere in the buroe; the silver must be a good deal tarnished, let them be brushed. Yes, Sir, said he, I will do it. It immediately occur'd to my remembrance that I had a pair of gold buttons. I removed all my papers in the esoritore to look for them, and finding they were gone, I said to the prisoner, I am surprised to think what the people will do with the gold buttons, whoever they are, for they are so very remarkable, that let me see them wherever I will, I shall know them, and there is a scratch on one of the stones. Sir, said he, perhaps they may wear them themselves. I turned myself round to the fire, and put on my stockings. The prisoner then brought up my silver buttons, and laid them down. I ordered him to go into the back parlour and fill the cistern with water. Sir, said he, I believe there is water enough in it. I said I had used it the day before. He went and brought up water, and in about five minutes after I went to wash my hands; the cistern was about equal with my face. As I was stooping, I saw my gold buttons lying on the pedestal, by the side of the cistern.
Q. Where had you put them last?
Smith. I had put them, with my knee and stock buckles, in a drawer, the morning before I was rob'd. I was greatly surprised at seeing them on the pedestal, and was not only satisfied with seeing them, but I took one of them in my hand and laid it down again. I thought to myself, if I remove them, I shall not be nearer a discovery than now, but if I leave them and take no notice of them, and find them removed when I come home, I may challenge either one or both of my servants with this robbery. I went out to dinner and return'd in the evening about six, but being obliged to go out immediately, I did not go to look for the buttons; but about eight in the evening I return'd, with a gentleman with me, and the prisoner lighted us into the fore parlour; he seem'd to want not to leave me. I desired him to set the candle down, and said I would light myself. I took up the candle, and said now I think I can make some discovery. I went to the cistern, and when I was looking there, the prisoner came into the room, and made an excuse about his not bringing water. I could not see the buttons, and not knowing but that somebody might have been in that room, and put the cistern over them. I took it up and look'd under it, but there were no buttons there.
Q. What time was this?
Smith. This was the same Wednesday at night; then I sat down to consider what to do, after which we went to justice Fielding, and I told him the circumstance as it occur'd to me. He said, I had done extreamly right. I asked his advice what I should do, and he said, the best thing is to take this gentleman home with you, and call up your man first, and tell him what you saw in the morning on the pedestal, and that at your return you found they were taken away; then call up your maid servant, and if neither of them own any thing of it, have warrants and take them both up. I went to the coffee-house to consider of it. I thought probably they might be arm'd with an excuse for removing them, so I concluded not to do as Mr. Fielding's had desired me, but wait the event for another day. I went out to the Temple, came home about four in the morning, went into my house in the same manner as usual, and asked if any body had been there. Every thing appear'd to be well. Upon my saying, William, when did you hear the watchman, has he been his hour? Sir, said he, he may have been his hour, but I have been asleep, and seemed confused. Is there any fire says I; he said, yes there is; said I, let my bed be warm'd. I went out to look for the watchman, and came in and went to bed, and the gentleman along with me, desiring the prisoner to call me about eight in the morning. I got up about half an hour after eight, went into the kitchen, then up to the gentleman and said, I am going up into William's room, knowing he was engaged below, and the maid also. I went up and tried to open a trunk box which he had there; on his bed lay ( I think) the same coat he has on now, and I am very sure the same waistcoat he has on; in the pocket of his waistcoat I found something wrap'd up in a paper, in which was the bowl part of a spoon and the handle of the same; they were very black. I had lost a silver table spoon with a crest (a lion rampant on it.) I found this to be the same, and it seem'd as if an attempt had been made to molt the handle. I went down to the gentleman, who was in bed, and desired he would come up with me. I shew'd him the pieces, and then put them in the pocket as before. In the window I found the handle part of a key, and it immediately occur'd to me, that this might be part of the key that was broke in my buroe; then we went down to breakfast.
Q. Who is that gentleman?
Smith. His name is Sadler, he is now at Hertford; he has lately broke his leg in Hide-park. I desired myself; and staid at home about half an hour, then bid them take care for dinner for themselves, for I should not dine at home, being going to Carey-Street to bleed a lady. I went out, but instead of going there, I went to justice Fielding and got a warrant. I returned in about three quarters of an hour, and then I brought a constable with me; I placed him in the parlour, and asked the maid where William was, saying, I wanted to send him out with a letter. She said he was gone out, and had told her he was going to his washerwoman. I waited in the parlour with the constable about two hours, when he return'd, which was about half an hour after three. I opened the door to him, got him into the back room, and shut the door, saying, William, I can't help being much surprised at your behaviour, and much more at your being guilty of this thing, but, Mr. Saunders, there is your prisoner. The constable took him in custody, and I charged him with the robbery. He for some time was greatly confused, and indeed I was a good deal affected with it, and immediately left him in the care of the constable. He for the space of five or six minutes did not speak, and then said he did not do it; this I think was to the constable. Being in the next room. and the door open, I heard the constable say, Pray, William, where is the silver spoon that your master saw to day in your pocket, and the gold buttons that lay on the pedestal of the cistern yesterday. The prisoner said he had no silver spoon in his pocket, and that he knew nothing of the buttons, but still he was a great deal confused. I said to him, William, there is sufficient proof against you in this affair, you must be concern'd beyond all doubt, and if there is any body concern'd with you in it, you will do right to give an account, but do not think of charging any body wrongfully, for the consequence of that will be worse than your own suffering. I asked him once or twice to discover the affair, but he denied it. At last he desired me to go into another room, and he would tell me where my things were. I went with him into the next room, and there he desired me not to let him go before justice Fielding, and that I would be merciful to him. I said it was very far from me to do any body harm, but was obliged to do this for the sake of the publick, yet after I had done it, if I could be of any service to him I would. At that time it appear'd to me there must be somebody concern'd with him. He said it was the first thing of the kind he ever had done. I asked him what could induce him to do it, and his answer was, he believed the d - I put it into his head, with many other such speeches. He said, if I would not let him go before justice Fielding, he would tell me where all my things were. I told him it would answer no purpose to him to keep any of the things from me. He told me that many of the things were at a place where he had private lodgings, out of my house. He went with me, Mr. Saunders, and another of Mr. Fielding's men, to the lodging, which was somewhere near the Seven-Dials, but I do not know the name of the street; it was a fore room up two pair of stairs, at a chandler's shop, where I found three sheets, a waistcoat, a pair of boots, a pair of pocket pistols, and in one of the bags with one of them was the silver spoon that I had seen in his pocket, broke in two pieces, fifteen pair of silk stockings, two neck cloths, and five stocks I said, here are not all; and he said, I'll tell you where the rest are I said, where are the gold buttons; he said. they are here, and took them out of his own breeches pocket. Then he took us to my house, and in a cocklost on the top of the house we found this coat and waistcoat that I have now on, about seven yards of Irish cloth. six or seven stocks, and one damask table cloth. Then he went with us to Mr Campion, a salesman in Monmouth Street, where he had sold two coats, two waistcoats, and one pair of breeches. All the things I have mentioned I found by his directions, my property. Then I went to Mr Fielding's, and he was brought soon after. When Mr. Fielding began to examine him, he owned his having taken all these things, and that the last mentioned two coats, two waistcoats, and breeches, he had taken a fortnight before, or thereabouts. He owned his having cut the shutter of the window, in order to deceive me, also his having attempted to open the escritore, and breaking open the bottom drawer of the buroe part.

Yes; the skin of a sheep that was killed, and four alive in the field; I believed them to be the sheep; when I came back to my father's, in my way back I saw the prisoner, he was on horseback, I was in the path, and he was in the road; I asked him whether he knew of any wrong sheep that road; he smiled, and said, no, he did not know of any.
Q. Did you tell him that you had lost any? - A. Yes; I told him we had lost nine, I did not tell him where they were lost from; then he went on, and I came on; then I went back to old Mr. Field's house, which is a public-house, and found the sheep.
Q. Did you see the skin? - A. Yes; Grover gave me a skin some days after.
Grover. The skin that I gave to him was the skin of the sheep that I killed; Mr. Spilling the constable has the skin.

Robinson. I cannot swear that this is the same skin.
Tingey. I believe this to be the skin of one of the sheep that I lost.
Prisoner's defence. I never had any more sheep but what I had honestly paid for; I did not know any thing about the sheep before Tuesday morning; I mentioned to Mr. Grover that I had got some sheep at home, and asked him if he wanted any; I told him he might have a score, or half a score, or fifteen, or any number he pleased; finding these sheep came wrong into my drove, and not knowing where they came from, I sent them to Mr. Grover's to be killed, because they were sinking in flesh; the other four I let Mr. Harman have; I told him they came wrong into my drove, I did not know the price, and when I learned the price I would let them know, for they should pay no more than Idid; Robinson came down on the Wednesday, and I paid him for the nine sheep; he took fifteen guineas from me for them, one pound fifteen shillings a-piece; he told me they were his property; I told young Grover to tell his father I did not know the price of them, when I found out the owner I would let him know.

            . I live in Goswell-street


. My house was broke open on the 12th July
, at night, or the 13th in the morning, and a silk purse in which was ten half guineas, a leather bag containing about thirty shillings, and six 5 s. 3 d. pieces, one nine shilling piece, and one 4 s. 6 d. which were in a tea-cup, and three silver table spoons, my property, were stolen out of a bureau in my parlour; and a silver milk-pot, a silver nutmeg grater, a pepper-box, a silver salt-seller, a silver chain, and a pair of steel scissars, the property of my sister. I fastened the window myself over night, and when my kinsman called me up in the morning I found the bottom hinge of the window shutter was forced off by drawing the nails, and the sash was half up. I saw the things the preceding night about seven or eight o'clock. I was sent for to Wood-street Compter, and saw the plate there (the plate produced.) I can swear the three table spoons are my property; they are marked J. A. P.

            . I was called up between two and three in the morning. I found the cupboard had been broke open, and the plate stolen. I saw the plate in the cup board the day before. I can swear that all this plate is my property, excepting the three table spoons.

                   Holmes
               



            . I am nephew to the prosecutor. I got up about two o'clock in the morning to go to market, and found the house was broke open; the window sash was thrown up, and the bottom hinge was wrench'd off. I am positive that the plate produced here is my uncle and aunt's property.


                  Isaac
                   Brown
               



            . I am a constable. I was at the Compter about business; 
               
                  Henry
                   Dickenson
               



             came up, and said, that 
               
                  Thomas
                   Darby
               



             was in the inner part of the Compter with a quantity of plate; one of the turnkeys went and fetched him out, and we found the plate that has been produced upon him. I asked him how he came by it; he said, he found it in the fields. Dickenson (who is now in Newgate for a burglary) said, that Bunce was concerned with him. We went to take Bunce; Dickenson tempted him out, by pretending to buy some of the plate, and then we took him.


                  Thomas
                   Kingman
               



            . I live at Wood-street Compter. Dickenson came into the Compter, and asked us to go with him to take Bunce; we went and took him. I searched his house, and under the boards I found two pistols, three chissels, and a pair of pincers.

                   Brown
               



            . Wood, Kingman, and I, went to search Bunce's lodgings, and I found these pistols (producing a horse and a pocket pistol;) the horse pistol was loaded with two slugs, the pocket pistol with one, and we found three chissels and a pair of pincers. (Producing them.)


                  Michael
                   Wood
               



            . I was at the searching Bunce's lodgings. We found the pistols and chissels buried under the ground, in the right hand corner of the fire place. I 
               
                  drew
               


             the slugs out of them. (Producing them.)
Bunce's Defence.
I was, walking along, and Brown took me into custody, and carried me to the Compter; they said, a house was broke open. I know nothing of the matter. Darby has an impediment in his speech, so that he can't speak here. He told me he found the plate in the fields.
Darby 


               acquitted of the burglary; guilty to value thirty-nine shillings
            .

, 1 piece of brown holland, containing 51 yards, value 21s.
            , the goods of

            . I am servant to William Farrar, who keeps a Scotch warehouse
, at No. 56, Bread-street


. On the 11th of July I was in the warehouse, the door was ajar - I heard a noise, turned my head, and saw a hand just within the entrance of the door, but I could not see the person's face - the hand laid hold of a piece of holland, and took it out. I opened the door, and the man let the goods fall - I pursued, and merely lost sight of him for half a minute, as he turned the corner. I am sure I caught sight of the same man again - it was the prisoner; he was stopped in my sight - the holland is worth 21s. I saw him drop it.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a porter. I heard the cry of Stop thief! at the corner of Bow-lane, Watling-street; I saw the prisoner running down Watling-street, and stopped him; Hutton and several others were pursuing him; he said, "It is nothing, only just a lark - let me go;" Hutton took him back.

            . I am a constable, and took him in charge with the holland - he had nothing to say.

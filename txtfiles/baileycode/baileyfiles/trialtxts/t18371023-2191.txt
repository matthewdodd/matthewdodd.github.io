MARTHA STEVENS
. I am the wife of William Stevens, and live at West Dray ton, in Middlesex. On the 5th of October I hung some things out to dry in the morning, in my garden—a woman went by about three o'clock, and told me to go out—I did not miss them then, but I did between three and four o'clock—I saw the prisoner with them on the road—I saw her go down by the hedge, close by my house—my little girl was standing at the door—she said something, and I Went out and stopped her—the property was found on her.





JOHN ROLFE
. I work for Mr. Burgess, a stone-mason. I was coming from Dray ton, by the garden, and saw the prisoner come from the gardengate with the things, she brought them, and put them into the ditch—I was not near enough to Mrs. Stevens to tell her—they were not found in the ditch—a little boy came, and took them out of the ditch—the prisoner ran after him, and said, "They are my things"—the little boy gave them up to her—she was taken about twenty minutes after—I was not present—was just gone on, but I saw her bring them from the gate—that little boy is not here.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not throw them at me, and say, "This is your bundle," and I said, It does not belong to me?" A. No.





JOHN LINTILL
. I am constable of West Drayton. The prisoner was given into my charge, with the shift and handkerchief—she has been in the parish four or five weeks—I have seen her once before.





MARTHA STEVENS
. I did not know the prisoner at all before—she was quite a stranger—the shift and handkerchief are mine.

Prisoner. This boy threw them at me in the road, and said, "This is your bundle"—I put them down and said, They do not belong to me"—I was going on the road, and the constable came and took me.

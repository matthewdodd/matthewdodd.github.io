JOHN SULLIVAN



, stealing 2 dead fowls, value 5s., the goods of 



William Weeks; Riley having been before convicted.






HENRY KING
. I live at Bridge-row, Pimlico. On 4th Jan., about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoners at Mr. Weeks', a fishmonger's and poulterer's shop—Sullivan took two fowls, passed one to Riley, and went on six or seven yards—he saw me, passed the other to Riley, and Riley ran back to the shop with the fowls—I took him—I could not get Sullivan—I am sure he is the boy—I knew them both before.

Sullivan. Q. Did I run away with the fowls? A. Six or seven yards; I picked one of them up—when you saw me, you ran as fast as you could.





WILLIAM WEEKS
. I am a fishmonger and poulterer, in Great Chapel-street, Westminster. These are my fowls (produced)—I know them by the bottom beal being cut off—it was cut off all the fowls I had—I had seen them safe five minutes before I left the shop.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (policeman) I received information, and took the prisoners—I told them what it was for—they said they never stole any fowls—I went to the station, and received the fowls.

Riley's Defence. Sullivan took up the fowls, and passed them into my hand; I put them down; I never went away from the shop.

Sullivan's Defence. I took up the fowl merely to give it to Riley to look at.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN

re-examined. I produce a certificate of Riley's former conviction—(read—Convicted Oct., 1847, and confined one month and whipped)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.

RILEY—

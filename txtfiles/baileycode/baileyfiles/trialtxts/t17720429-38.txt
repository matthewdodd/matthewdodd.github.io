            . I keep a house in Clerkenwell


. I let the prisoner a lodging in the month of March last, for her and her husband. My wife missed several things out of the lodging on the 2d of April; in consequence of which I had the prisoner taken up.
- Beale. I am servant to Mr. Harrington, a pawn-broker in Turnmill-street; the prisoner pawned this looking-glass there (producing it) on the 19th of March.
- Jones. I am a pawn-broker on Saffron-hill; the prisoner's sister Howard pawned this pillow-bier and blanket (producing them) with me.
The Constable deposed that he found the goods at the pawnbroker's by the prisoner's direction.
Prisoner's Defence.
The things were all pawned by Howard; she had not a lodging; so I let her be in my room, and she pawned the things.




               Guilty. 10 d.

WILLIAM MEARS. On Saturday, the 12th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Berkeley-street


 - she wished me to go with her; I refused to have any thing to do with her, but she walked by my side; I felt her hand in my pocket; she pulled her hand out, and put it to her mouth - I felt, and missed two sovereigns and five shillings; I took from her mouth a sovereign, a half-crown, and two shillings, before the watchman came up - the rest has not been found.

            . I am a watchman. I was in Dover-yard, and heard the prisoner making a noise - I went up, and the prosecutor said she had robbed him, and he had just taken this money from her mouth; he said hewanted another sovereign and a sixpence, but they have not been found.
Prisoner's Defence. He wanted to go with me, but he was too tipsy - he gave me a few shillings - he called me back, and said, "Give me that money back;" I would not, and put it into my mouth; he called the watchman, and gave me in charge.

            . I am a carpenter
; we were at work at St. Giles's


 on the 26th of February, and all the things mentioned in the indictment were taken away; after they were found again, I heard the prisoner confess he had taken them.

            . I took the prisoner with a saw in his hand, in Great Wild-street; he went and shewed us where the rest of the things were, at the Wheat-sheaf alehouse in Drury-lane; (produced and deposed to by the respective owners.)
Prisoner's defence.
I had been out of business thirteen weeks, and was in distress; to be sure I took the things.

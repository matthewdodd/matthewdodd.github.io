WILLIAM HENRY SEABROOK
. I live in Furnival's Inn. At a quarter to nine o'clock, on the 11th of August, I was in Long-lane, Aldersgate-street—I felt a tug at my coat—I turned, and saw the prisoner draw the handker chief from my pocket, and saw it in the prisoner's hand—he ran away, and I caught him—he was immediately rescued by half a dozen of his companions

—I followed him again, and called, "Stop thief"—I was thrown down in the struggle, but I am positive he is the man that drew the hand kerchief.

Prisoner. Q. When you saw me with the handkerchief in my hand, where were you? A. Just turning into Aldersgate-street—I am quite sure he is the man that took it.





JAMES REDWOOD
. I am patrol of Aldersgate. When I came up, the prisoner and the prosecutor were getting up off the ground—if I had been one minute later, the prisoner would have got away—there were a hundred people, I should think, in the crowd.




GUILTY

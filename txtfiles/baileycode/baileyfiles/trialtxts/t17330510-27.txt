                     John 
                     Butler 
                  



                
            , for 


               receiving six Guineas, part of the said Money, knowing it to have been stolen
            .
Whiting was the Prosecutor's Servant
; she confess'd to her Master and Mistress that she took the Money out of their Drawers, by the Persuasion of Butler, who, she said, waited the while in the next Room, and that she give it all to him, he having promis'd to marry her. Butler was carry'd before the Justice, who took his Confession in writing. The Justice neither attending in Court himself, nor sending any other to prove the Confession, Butler was 

               acquitted
            ; but Whiting having made a Confession before she came to the Justice, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 39 s

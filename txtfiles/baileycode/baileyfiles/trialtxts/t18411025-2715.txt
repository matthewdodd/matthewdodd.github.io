WILLIAM TEBENHAM
. I am shopman to Mr. Bellamy, a butcher, in Lombard-court. I was in Catherine-street, Strand, on the 29th of September —I saw the prisoner go behind a gentleman, and take a handkerchief from him—I looked round for a policeman, and saw Baker—I told him, and he took him—he found this handkerchief on him in my presence—I am certain I saw him take it and put it under his arm—I have not found the gentleman's name.





THOMAS HOLT

HENRY EDWARD BAKER

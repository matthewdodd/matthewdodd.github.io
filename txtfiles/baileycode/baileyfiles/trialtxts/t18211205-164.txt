            . I am a broker, and live at Lambeth. On the 23rd of November, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was in James-street, Covent-Garden


; I saw the three prisoners in company with another, coming from the Piazza towards Long-acre; they stopped at Brown's oil-shop a few minutes, and then Bryand went in and took two bundles of Emery paper out. I stopped Williams and Flood, and found the paper on Williams. Before I secured them they went along Hart-street together, and stood a few minutes, then ran up Phoenix-yard; I ran round and secured them in Hanover-street. Flood said he would have his regulars out of Williams. Bryand's father brought him to the office, on hearing he was wanted; I took them to Brown, who missed the paper; I know his name is Williams.

            . I am a painter, and live in Dean-street. Duke's account is correct; I helped to secure them.
WILLIAMS'S Defence. Two chaps dropped the paper; I picked it up, the same as any body else would; this boy ran up and cried out halves.

SOPHIA SAMWAYS.
I am the wife of James Sam ways, a messenger in the Treasury, living in Belgrave-place. I was robbed on the 2nd of November—I have a garden in front, and they got over the iron palisades at the bottom of the garden, between eleven and three o'clock in the night, got into the area, cut the safe, and slipped the lock—I lost three brushes, a knife, and a piece of sirloin of beef—to the best of my knowledge I have seen my knife since—it is a pruning-knife—I have had it many years—this is it—(examining it)—I have used it—these brushes are mine.





THOMAS IRONS
(police-constable B158.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd of December, about two o'clock in the morning—I found the brushes and knife in his house in the morning—he was taken into custody and locked up in the watch-house.

Prisoner's Defence. These brushes I bought in Berwick-court, about twelve months ago, and I can find a person who used them.

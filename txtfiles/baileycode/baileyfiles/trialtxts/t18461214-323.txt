CATHERINE CALVIN

On Fridry morning, the 4th of Dec, Richard Sidney Heath came to the shop and asked for a pair of shoes—I said I had none to suit him—he went away, and as soon as he was gone somebody came in, and I found a pair of shoes were gone, which I had seen safe when I opened the shop, which might be an hour before—this is the pair—they are my husband's.





JOSEPH POTTER
. I saw Richard Sidney Heath go into the prosecutor's shop—William Heath was waiting outside—Richard Sidney Heath came out again—I went into the shop, and heard what was lost—I went after the prisoners.





WILLIAM ATLEB
 (police-constable L 110.) I took Richard Sidney Heath, William Heath ran away—I found these shoes afterwards at the lodging, where the two prisoners lodge with their mother and her daughter.

William Heath I do not lodge there.

Richard Sidney Heath. The woman said she missed the shoes about twelve o'clock, and was there not time enough for anybody else to have gone in and stolen them? I bought the shoes.

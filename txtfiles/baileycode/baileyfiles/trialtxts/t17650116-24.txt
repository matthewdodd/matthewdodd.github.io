            , Esq; The prisoner was servant
 to me from June last. I keep my silver in my waistcoat pocket when I travel: I missed a small quantity at three different times, when I was abroad; I usually missed it after he had brushed my cloaths. Since I came home, a few days ago, I was determined to find him out; I had twenty-one shillings and six-pence, distinctly marked with a scratch, under the date of each: I put them into my waistcoat pocket; he took my cloaths out to brush; when he returned with the cloaths, I counted my money; he did, and there were my two shillings marked as the rest (Produced in court): also several of the others to compare; they exactly corresponded.

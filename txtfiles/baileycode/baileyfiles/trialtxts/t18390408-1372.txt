EDWARD JAMES
. I am a grocer, and live in Shoreditch. On Friday evening, the 29th of March, I was passing down Church-street, and perceived a person tread on my heel, but it excited no suspicion till my pocket fell—I then stopped, felt my pockets, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner pass, with another person, behind me—I went towards them, the prisoner started to run, and I saw him throw my handkerchief away—I pursued him about one hundred yards, calling, "Stop thief," and the policeman stopped him without my losing sight of him.





HENRY SINGER
 (police-constable H 148.) About seven o'clock, on the evening of the 29th of March, I was in Cock-lane, Shoreditch—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," in a direction of Church-street—I saw the prisoner running towards me, pursued by Mr. James—I caught him—James came up, and charged him with stealing a handkerchief—he denied it OWEN JUDGE. I heard the alarm given. I saw the prosecutor running after somebody—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner, I was not so near him—I saw the person stopped—I picked up the handkerchief at the corner of Cock-lane, adjoining Church-street.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoners Defence. I was running towards my home when the police-man pounced on me, and knocked me down, although I declared, my innocence.




GUILTY
. *** Aged 16.—


Transported for Ten Years.

 about eleven o'clock at night, on the 21st of August, going the nearest way home from Covent-garden; the prisoner came and took my hat off - he was standing near Great Russell-street; he seemed to be alone - he ran off with it; I pursued, and got my hat from the Policeman, who took it from the prisoner.

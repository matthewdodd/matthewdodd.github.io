CHARLES HAGAR
. I am a policeman. On the 25th of October I was in Limehouse between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the two prisoners and another person together—I noticed them coming up the street—I knew them before—I was about to speak to them—they turned up New-street

saw me following them, and ran—I west down another street and met them—I caught Smith and he dropped a shirt by his side—he said he had been down to wash—I then took him into a shop, and found the stockings in his pocket—Brown had then ran away—I found him the next night—I am quite positive he is the person—I should think they were a mile from the prosecutor's.





MARY ANN JACQUES
. I am the wife of Jonathan Jacques—he lives at Blackwall—these are our property—I lost them from the yard at the back of our house—there were three shirts—two of them are Wet, and a pair of drawers. Smith's Defence. I bought the shirts and stockings in Ratcliffe Highway.

            . On the 7th of January, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was with the other witnesses, and saw the prisoner and two more watching Messrs. Walkingtons' shop. In about a quarter of an hour we saw one of them take half a cheese and give it to the prisoner - all three ran different ways. I pursued the others, but was thrown down and my hat knocked off. I am sure the prisoner is one of them.

            . I was with Read, watching the prisoner and two more. One of them reached in, took the cheese off a pile, and gave it to the prisoner, who stood ready to receive it. I secured him with it.

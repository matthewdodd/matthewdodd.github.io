JAMES WILLIAM FRENCH. On the 12th of July, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I was walking in
Wardour-street


, a person accosted me, and said I had lost my handkerchief - the officer afterwards produced it.

            . I saw the three prisoners in St. Martin's-court - they followed the prosecutor through Leicester-square, Princes-street, and into Wardour street. I then saw Keith take the handkerchief - he and Anderson ran into Tyler's-court. I ran and took Benson at the corner of the court - Reardon took the other two in the court. I went into the public-house, and saw the handkerchief in Reardon's hand.

            . I was with Bertram. I saw the three prisoners together for about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; they followed the prosecutor a little distance, and when they got near Tyler's-court, I saw Keith and Anderson rush into the court. I took Keith, and then Anderson, and the moment I took Anderson, I saw this handkerchief drop - Benson was at the end of the court.
Prisoner BENSON. Q. How long was I with the other prisoners? A. About ten minutes.
ANDERSON'S Defence. I was going to Mr. Jones, in Wardour-street for work. I met Keith, and a man came and took us.
BENSON'S Defence. I was going along Wardour-street, and met Keith. I stood and spoke to him a minute or two, and was going away, when I was taken, on the contrary side of the way to the other two.
KEITH'S Defence. I was walking down Wardour-street - the man took me and threw me on the ground.

            . I am a furniture-broker
. About ten o'clock in the morning of the 26th of December, I saw the prisoner come to my door, and take something off a chest of drawers; I made my way towards him, and saw him run - I ran after him, and when I was within a yard of him he turned round a court, and dropped this lamp from under his coat; he got away - I informed an officer, and he was taken three days afterwards; he is the boy, I am certain - I pointed him out from among ten others.

            . I am a tailor
, and live at Bromley


. On the 13th of May, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed, and found my shop broken open. The bolt had been wrenched off the back door - it was quite light then. I cannot say whether it was broken open before or after daylight. I missed three pieces of cotton and other things - I found the cotton at the watch-house.

            . I am a constable of Mile End. On the 13th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I secured the prisoner with a bundle, which contained three pieces of cotton - he said he was going to carry them to Mr. Piggot, of Stratford, and had brought them from his master, Mr. Lewis, at the end of Well-street. I sent a carman to Lewis; he returned, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that Lewis said he had not sent a person out with any bundle; the prisoner then said he found the things in Stepney church-yard, by the pump.

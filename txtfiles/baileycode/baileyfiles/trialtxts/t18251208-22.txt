JOHN DOUDNEY. I am the son of Edward Phillips Doudney, and brother of Edward Doudney, they are tailors

, and have a shop in Lombard-street


. On the 21st of November, about ten minutes past four o'clock, these trousers were at the door, inside; I was engaged with two gentlemen, and heard a pull, turned round, and they were gone; the prisoner ran by the side window; I ran out, and took him, without losing sight of him; he was tucking them under his coat - he made great resistance. The shop ticket is upon them.

Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman came up, and said"What have you got?" I said, "Nothing but my waistcoat" - he was going to let me go, when a gentleman said,"Here are the trousers," but they never saw me drop them.

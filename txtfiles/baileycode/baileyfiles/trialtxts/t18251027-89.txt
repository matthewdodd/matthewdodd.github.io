            . I am a tailor. I was in Smithfield about five o'clock on the evening of the 23d of September - I saw Collender there - the prisoner, who was near him, took the handkerchief from his pocket - I informed Collender, and the prisoner was seized, but whether the handkerchief was found or not I do not know.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it? A. Yes, I did.
WILLIAM COLLENDER. I am a paper-hanger
. I was in Smithfield


, and heard from Farman that my pocket had been picked; I pursued the prisoner and collared him - I told him to give me the handkerchief - he said he had none - he wanted to get away and struck me, and I saw him work the handkerchief down on the ground.

Prisoner's Defence. There was a quarrel about a horse, and a man in a fustian jacket, who stood by the prosecutor, put the handkerchief down on the ground - I went on and a gentleman came to me and said I had had it.

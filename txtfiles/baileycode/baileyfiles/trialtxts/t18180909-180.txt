            . I am the carrier
 from Rickmansworth to London. On the 4th of August I met the prisoner on Holborn-hill; he asked me to take three boxes in my waggon for him. He asked if he might get up and ride as far as St. Giles's, I told him he might; when he had rode about twenty yards he got off and ran away with a parcel. I took him in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and gave him in charge. I found the parcel under the waistband of his breeches.

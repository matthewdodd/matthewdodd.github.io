1394. 




JAMES PONEY
, was indicted

 for feloniously receiving, on the 
27th of Feb., 41bs. weight of pork, value 2s.; and 21bs. weight of butter, 2s.; the goods of 



Daniel Thompson, well knowing them to have been stolen; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






FRANCES FINCH
. I am single, and live with my sister. On the 26th of Feb. I put a boiled leg of pork into a safe at the back of Mr. David Thompson's premises, and next morning it was gone.





JOHN EASTON
. I live with my father, in Greyhound-place, Lambeth. On the 27th of Feb. Charles Godchild came to my house, and said something to me—at seven o'clock in the morning he came again, and showed me some boiled pork—the prisoner was with Godchild, and asked him if he wanted to sell it—Godchild said, yes, and asked him 1s. for it—the prisoner said, "I will give you 10d."—he gave him 6d. then, and 4d. more in the afternoon.

Q. How was the prisoner to know that it was stolen? A. Because Godchild told him he had had a pull—that means it was stolen—that was before he bought it—there was about 3 1/2 lbs. of it.





WILLIAM EDMEAD
. I am a policeman. I took Godchild, and he pleaded guilty to stealing this pork—the prisoner was at that time in custody for an assault, and I could not take him then, but when I did take him he said he did not wish to have anything to do with the pork, but Godchild brought it.

Prisoner. I never had anything to do with it; when the lad said he had had a pull I told him to be off.





JOHN EASTON

re-examined. He did buy it in my presence—he put it under one side of his jacket, and two pounds of butter on the other, in my father's back room.





ROBERT EMMERSON
 (police-sergeant V 9.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at the office of the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person then tried and convicted.




GUILTY
. * Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

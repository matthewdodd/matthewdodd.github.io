             and MARTHA (HIS WIFE
) were indicted for 


               feloniously receiving, on the 24th of February
, of a certain evil disposed person, 3lbs, weight of sugar, value 1s. 6d; 1 1/2 oz. weight of ginger, value 1d.; 2 ozs. of washing blue, value 2d., and 3lbs. weight of cheese, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 
                     
                        
                           James

                  , which had been lately before stolen, they well knowing the same to have been stolen
            ; against the Statute, &c.

            . I keep a grocer's and cheesemonger's shop
, in Gravel-lane. In the month of February last, I missed candles, soap, and other things; I could not comprehend how it went - the male prisoner is a barber

, and used to shave me three times a week; he lived at the corner of Sarah-street


. On the 23d of February, I bought a number of articles of Mr. Harrison, among the rest were twenty Dutch cheeses - I missed one of them on Tuesday morning, the 24th; the prisoner had not been in my house that day, but I went to him in the afternoon - I said I had lost a great many articles, and asked if my daughter hadever brought any property there; she is fourteen years of age - the prisoner's wife said No, she had only been there once to warm herself; the man was sitting there by the fire, with his head down - I then went out and got a warrant for my daughter, on suspicion of taking this cheese; I went to the house, and the female prisoner said I was very welcome to search the house - it is a shop; there is a bed-room behind it - my daughter was not with me at that time; I did not see the female prisoner move - my daughter went to the house with the officer next morning.

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information from the daughter, I went to the prisoner's house; I saw them both, and said, "Where is the cheese Mr. Harwood's daughter brought here on Tuesday?" Spratt said, "She brought no cheese here," and I was welcome to search - his wife then came into the shop, and said I might search; I followed her quickly into the backroom, and saw the blankets of the bed move; she ran to a closet - I said, "The cheese must be some where about here;" I got a candle, and down inside the lining of the wainscot, in the closet, I found this half of a cheese; I said, "Here is the very thing I want: this is Harwood's cheese;" the man said, "Yes, that is Harwood's cheese;" I asked how he came to take it in - he said the daughter complained of being very hungry, as her father would not allow her enough to eat, and the cheese was brought there that she might have a bit whenever she went over to their house -I asked when she brought it; he said, "About a fortnight ago;" his wife said, "No, my dear, as it has come to this. tell the truth - it was brought in last Tuesday;" I asked him again when it was brought in; he said, "About a fortnight ago;" his wife again said it was on the Tuesday; I desired her to hold her tongue, as I did not want to take her - I then took the man to the office, went back to their house, and asked if there was any tea there; a boy, who was there, said "Yes, an ounce;" I looked, and found this paper of tea and canister of tea, a caddy full of sugar, and some other sugar; I searched further, and found this ginger and blue; the female prisoner came in, and I asked if she had any tea - she said she bought two ounces of a person who called; she afterwards acknowledged that the girl brought the tea, sugar, and blue, and said she gave her a cup of coffee now and then, and some tea, when she wanted it.

            . I know Mr. Spratt's house. On the Tuesday in question I saw 
               
                  Martha 
                  Harwood
               



             run past my house, and turn as if she was going down Sarah-street; she had her apron turned up, as if there was something under it.

                  HARWOOD
               



            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. I used to take this property from time to time to the prisoner's house, without my father's knowledge; Mr. Spratt used to give me some halfpence in the morning, and promised to give me a row of beads, as I was to bring him all I could; I took tea there, sugar, blue, and cheese -Mrs. Spratt took the tea; her husband was there at the time; they were both present when I took the sugar - I cannot exactly say which took it in; I passed Mansfield's house with the cheese; I rolled it into the prisoner's house, but I did not go in; this was on the Tuesday morning - the prisoners knew that it was my father's property.

            's Defence. I had this tea of a tallyman, who called once a fortnight; the sugar I had of a sailor - I never said I had the tea of a girl; she said she threw the cheese into my passage, but I did not see it; it was a dark morning; I took a light, and found this piece of cheese in the passage; I told my husband of it at breakfast time; the girl came in, and said her mother-in-law did not give her victuals enough, and she was going to look after a place - she came in perished with cold; she then said she had thrown the cheese into the passage, and meant to have it as she wanted it; she said she had had a pint of boiling water thrown over her, and shewed me some bruises on her arm - having four children of my own, I felt grieved to think this girl was so ill-used, and I used to give her victuals from time to time; she was there one morning, and her father came in, and she seemed confounded at seeing him.

            . I did find her there one morning, and told her to go home; we never starved the girl; she was so fed up by these people, that she would scarcely take any thing at home.

            . My father and mother gave me the best of victuals at all times; and when I went home, home was ready for me.

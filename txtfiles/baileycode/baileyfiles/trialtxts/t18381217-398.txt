THOMAS RAGAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of December, 2 tools, called copper bits, value 5s., the goods of 



Edward Thomas Rogers.






EDWARD THOMAS ROGERS
. I live at Woodford, and am a smith. I lost these copper bits from my workshop on Thursday evening, the 6th of December—they are worth 5s.—the prisoner lives at Laytonstone—he had been to my shop to fetch some work for his employer—I went to him on the Friday, and found one of the bits at his place, where he was at work—I asked how he came by them—he said, "Your apprentice lent them to me"—I inquired where the other one was—he denied having that one at all, but I found it in searching his house afterwards—these are the tools.

Prisoner. Master gave him an order to make some tin spouts—I went to his shop for them, and he told me to ask him for an iron, and instead of one, I had two which I borrowed there.





STEPHEN FLOWERS
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Rogers. Ragan said I lent him one of these irons, which I did not—it is all false.

Prisoner. When I went down for the spouts, I said I was to have a soldering iron. Witness. No, you did not.





DAVID JOHNSON
 (police-constable C 61.) On Friday afternoon Mr. Rogers came to me—we went to the prisoner's, and I stopped back—the prosecutor came, and said he had found one of his tools—I went and took the prisoner

—after I had locked him up, Mr. Rogers asked if he knew any thing of the other bit—he said no, and the one he had the apprentice lent him—I went to his house, and found the other concealed.

Prisoner. I had my master's orders to get the tools, and I told the Magistrate so—I have worked sixteen years for the same master and his brother.

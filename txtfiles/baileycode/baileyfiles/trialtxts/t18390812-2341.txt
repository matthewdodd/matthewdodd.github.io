HENRY BRIDGES
. I am a hat-block cutter, and live in Gilbert-street. About a quarter before nine o'clock last night I was in Long Acre—I had a handkerchief in my poscket—I did not feel it taken from me, but I received information, and the prisoner then broke between me and a lady I was in company with—he pretended to be drunk, and dropped my handkerchief—my brother picked it up—I went and collared the prisoner, and took a silk handkerchief out of his hand, and took him to Bow-street.





JAMES WESTMORELAND
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner—he was quite sober—this is the prosecutor's handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and saw the prosecutor at the corner of James-street—he said, "You have got my handkerchief"—I had my own handkerchief in my hand, and I said, "Is this it?"—he said, "No," and took me to the station-house.

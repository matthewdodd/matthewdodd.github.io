            . I am servant to Mr. Kennistone in the Strand, he is a haberdasher
; the prisoner came and desired to look at some thread of different colours; this was on the 29th of September; then she wanted some other things, and desired we would get them ready, and she would call again for them. She went away; Mr. Steward said, he saw her put something into her pocket; we followed her up the Strand; she went into a cabinet-maker's shop. I went in and asked her, if she had not been at Mr. Kennistone's shop? she said, no. Then I said, have you not been there and ordered some goods? Then she said, yes; and she was just coming for them. I asked her to step with me there; she went along with us; we took a constable with us; we searched her at our master's shop, and found two pieces of ribband, my master's property and divers other pieces of ribbands upon her, [ Produced in court] one of the pieces had the letter D. our private mark, upon it.

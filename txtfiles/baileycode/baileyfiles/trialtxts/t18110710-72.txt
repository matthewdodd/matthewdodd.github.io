HARRIOT HOBBS. I am a servant
. I live at Hamptoncourt, I lent my shawl to a Abice Foot.
ABICE FOOT. On Sunday, the 26th of May, I was at Mr. Smith's, Hamptoncourt, I generally stop and help them in the kitchen, the cook lent me her shawl to walk home with; when I got home I took the shawl off and laid it on a table in the room, and laid a silk handkerchief upon it, I had no person in the room but the maid; I missed the shawl and the silk handkerchief. On the Saturday following, I asked her what she had done with the shawl and handkerchief, she answered that she never saw them; I went away to my Parish, she went away in a little time after.
Q. Did you ever find the shawl - A. Yes, in her mother's house, at Essen, it was in the prisoner's box, and new things that she had bought with my money. The silk handkerchief I never found.
MR. COLLEY, I am a constable, I produce the prisoner's box, in the box I found this shawl, and the other things were quite new.
HARRIOT HOBBS. That is my shawl.
Prisoner's Defence. I took the shawl, I meant to return it again.

             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 6th of February
, 16 bushels of wheat, value 5l.
            , the goods of

MR. CLARKSON conducted the prosecution.

                  BOARDS
               



            . I live at Edmonton


, and am a farmer

                  John 
                  Wheeler
               



             fastened my barn on the night of the 6th of February, and next morning he told me it was broken open - I examined, and found part of the roof had been untiled, sufficient for two to have got in; I missed some wheat from the bulk - I thought about two quarters; I found a hat in the barn, which I believe is here - I gave notice to Camp, the officer, and went with him to Taylor's, at a place called Journeyman's-green, on the following day - I think Wheeler went with me; Catling lives next door to Taylor - I found at Taylor's a bed-tick filled with wheat in the chaff, and the bed clothes on it - the bed appeared made; I think there were about six bushels in the tick, and I found about five pecks in a sack in the house -I have compared the wheat I found there with that in my barn, and I believe it to be part of the same wheat; I found at Catling's about five pecks of wheat, from which the chaff had been blown, and some chaff was buried by the side of the house.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Do you pretend to distinguish your wheat from other wheat? A. As far as possible, I think I can - there is much difference in thequality, weight, and colour of it; it was in the chaff, in which state it is not sold - it was very good, and cleaner than it is in general; that I found at Catling's was not in the chaff, but it was not then in a marketable state - it was in such a state as a poor person might have it for his own use; Catling was in my service about three years ago - I do not know that we had any difference; I do not recollect having a fowl injured or killed, or talking of instituting a prosecution against any body, and applying to Catling to give evidence - he made a false charge against me, but I am ready to meet it in any way.


                  JOHN 
                  WHEELER
               



            . I am thresher to Mr. Boards. I made his barn fast on the night of the 6th of February, and the next morning I found the roof broken - I think about two quarters of wheat were missing; I saw the wheat which was found at the prisoner's; in my judgment it was the same as the bulk - that found at Catling's had been partly cleaned, but not entirely.
Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said before that you could not say that it was the same wheat? A. No, Sir, I never said so to any one - I said I could not positively swear to it, but I believe it was the wheat.


                  DANIEL 
                  BARNES
               



            . I am a watchman of Edmonton. On the night of the 6th of February, at twenty minutes past ten o'clock I saw the four prisoners together, at the William the Fourth beer-shop, which is about three quarters of a mile from Mr. Boards'; (they had gone through the town about nine) - as I was proceeding on my beat they overtook me in a lane which leads to Mr. Boards' barn, but about half a mile from it - this was about halfpast ten o'clock; Taylor and Catling collared me, and said they did not care for such a d-d watchman as me; I had not done any thing to them.
Cross-examined. Q. Were they in the road to Catling's house? A. Yes, they could go that way; I should not have noticed them if they had not noticed me.


                  JAMES 
                  LAMBERT
               



            . I am a shoe-maker, and live at Edmonton. Camp came to me on the 7th of February - I told him where the two Berrys lived; I have seen this hat which was found in the barn; it is 
               
                  William 
                  Berry
               



            's hat; I have often seen him wear it, and John Berry also - I went with Camp to the barn and saw some footsteps in a track, which corresponded with the shoes of William and 
               
                  John 
                  Berry
               



             - I measured the width of them; I have compared them with this shoe, which William Berry had on - here is a hob on one side of their shoes, which had made a mark in the footsteps - I had sold them the shoes; I know they are theirs.


                  JOHN 
                  CAMP
               



            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Boards to Taylor and Catling's - I have been a farmer, and in my judgment the wheat found corresponds with the bulk - I know that Lambert got the shoes from Berry; when I took the Berrys, they said they were at home by nine o'clock, and then they said it was nothing to me - there is a communication from Catling's house to Taylor's, by a trap-door; here is the hat which was found in the barn.
Cross-examined. Q. Are they not both under the same roof? A. Yes, it is not common for houses of that description to have a communication - I never saw it before; the partition-wall is usually carried up to the top; the door is in the partition and pulls up - it is in the up stairs room; you go under the roof which hangs over, in a sloping way - the wheat found at Catling's, has some chaff in it now - Catling and Taylor were not at home when I went; Catling gave himself up the next morning.


                  THOMAS 
                  GILES
               



            . I went with Camp; what he has stated is correct.


                  William 
                  Berry
               



            's Defence. When the constable came to me, he asked where my hat was, and I showed him the one I have now in my hand; it is the one I have always worn when I have carried a fish basket; but I have, for the last three weeks, been working on the road; Lambert is my brother-in-law - he rushed into my house three months before and cut my neck with a knife; he has used my sister very ill - he has said he would do me an injury, and hang me if he could.


                  John 
                  Berry
               



            's Defence. I never saw that hat in my life - I know nothing about it.
Taylor's Defence. The wheat found in my house was only a bushel and a half.
Catling's Defence. The wheat found at my house 'I had from my sister Hannah Fuller, and I thought it would be more good to me when my wife was confined than before.


                  HANNAH 
                  FULLER
               



            . I am Catling's sister. His wife, my brother, and I, gleaned some wheat, and Catling had it about a week before from my house in Silver-street.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you glean it? A. In August last, about Edmonton - we gleaned sometimes in three or four fields in a day; this was mixed wheat - we gleaned some of Mr. Boards' and some of Mr. Knight's.
COURT. Q. Did you permit the small wheat to remain with it? A. We cleaned it ourselves in a little sieve on a sheet - I put the chaff on a little piece of ground before my garden; I know my sister had two chaff pillows given to her.
JURY to MR. BOARDS. Q. Did the chaff you found buried appear to be fresh buried? A. It was not matted as chaff usually is, which has been in a pillow or a bed.

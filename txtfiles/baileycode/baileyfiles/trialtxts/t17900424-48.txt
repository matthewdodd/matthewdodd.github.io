I am shopman to Mr. Heathcote; he is a wholesale haberdasher
, in Milk-street


: I was in the counting-house: I saw the prisoner go from the door with something under his arm; I followed him; he saw me, and threw down the bundle; I went after him: he turned round, and damned me, and told me not to follow him, if I did he would mark me.
Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. What time was this? - It was about half past six.
It was dark? - It was duskish.
The person you saw go out of the shop might be a different person from the person you overtook? - I saw his face when he turned round upon me.
You did not see his face in the shop? - No.
Court. He was never out of sight? - No.

I produce this bundle; I have had it ever since.
(Deposed to.)
Mitchell. A person picked it up; I did not see him, but I saw it in the water; it is the same thread; I do not know who the person was.
Court. When you came back was it in the same place? - No; it was laid on the counter, by the door.
Mr. Garrow. You cannot be sure it is the same? - No; but I believe it to be the same.
You never saw his face once? - I saw the prisoner go from the door.
Prisoner. My witnesses are not come from the country.

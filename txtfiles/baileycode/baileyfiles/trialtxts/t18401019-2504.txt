GEORGE BROWN
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
15th of September, 1 watch, value 6l., the goods of 



David Hughes.—2nd COUNT, stating it to be the goods of Richard Clarke Austin.






DAVID HUGHES
. I am a watchmaker, and live in Frith-street, Soho. On the 15th of September the prisoner came, and said he called for his watch, and asked if it was done—I asked what name he left it in—he said, "Brown"—I looked over my book, and told him I had no watch left in that name—he pointed to one in the window, and said, "That is mine"—I took it down, looked at my book again, and saw it was booked in another name—he said, "Very likely my brother-in-law left it in his own name" I asked his brother-in-law's name—he said, "Austin," which was the name in which it had been left—I made no hesitation in giving it to him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You delivered it to him, believing the pretence he made, that it was left by his brother-in-law? A. Yes—I did not see him again till after he was in custody at Marlborough-street, I think in about a fortnight or three weeks—I positively swear he is the man—I recollect his countenance—he was dressed in a black coat—the watch has not been found.





RICHAD CLARK AUSTIN
. This was my watch—I had left it with Mr. Hughes's shopman—I have not the slightest knowledge of the prisoner—I never sent him any where—I have entirely lost the watch.

Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a watch was it? A. A silver hunter, capped and jewelled, made by Spurge, of Woolwich.




GUILTY
. Aged 54.—


Transported for Seven Years more.

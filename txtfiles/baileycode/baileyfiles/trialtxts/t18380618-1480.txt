JOHN PAUL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
14th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



George Lapraik, from his person.






GEORGE LAPRAIK
. I follow the bonnet blocking business. About a quarter past ten o'clock on the 15th of May, I was in Goswell-street, looking into a shop—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner—I then went to the other end of the window, and looked in again—he followed me and took my handkerchief out of my pocket—I turned round the moment I missed it, and found it in the prisoner's coat pocket—he was walking very quietly up a court—I told him he had my handkerchief—he said no, he had not, that he had no occasion to take mine, he had one of his own—I was taking it from him, and the policeman came out of a shop, and took him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see or feel me at your pocket? A. Yes; there were two more with you, but you had the handkerchief.





SAMUEL BROWN
 (police-constable G 88.) I was on the spot, and saw the prosecutor take the handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket—I have had it ever since—I produce it—I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I came out to buy some tobacco—an accident occurred, and the people were looking in at a doctor's shop—two boys and a girl were looking in as well as me—as I turned away, I saw this handkerchief on the ground—I took it up and walked away—before I got seven or eight yards, the prosecutor came and took me, and said I had his handkerchief—I said no, I had not any but my own and one I picked up—a man came up and said he had got the wrong one, it was a boy picked his pocket.

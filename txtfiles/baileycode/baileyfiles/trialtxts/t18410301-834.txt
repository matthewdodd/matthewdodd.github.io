MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






JAMES CARTER
. I am foreman to John Henry Machu, a silk-trimming manufacturer, in Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row—the two prisoners were in

his service—Garrett was a winder, and had been about three years there—in consequence of information on the 18th of February I directed Garnish to watch in the lower room of the factory—the machinery communicates from one story to another, through which there are holes that you can see through—when the workmen go down to dinner no one is allowed to remain in the upper room—I saw the workmen go to their dinner—the prisoners did not go out—I locked the room—Garnish told me something, and when the workmen left that evening, I directed a policeman to be on the spot—this is the silk braid that was found on Garrett—there was work of this kind in the upper room—silk braid is the proper term for it—there were 129 yards found on Garrett—this is my master's—I have no doubt of it—I looked in the tin-boxes, and found the work deficient.





JAMES GARNISH
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 18th of February, while the workmen were gone to dinner, I watched—I could see through a hole into the upper room very plainly—I saw Smith come to a tin box, and take something out—I followed the prisoners when they left in the afternoon—Carter took Garrett, and gave him to the policeman.





JACOB DAVIES
. I am a police-constable. I was on the watch and took Garrett and Smith—I searched Garrett and found this silk round his body under his shirt—there are 129 yards.

GARRETT—


GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

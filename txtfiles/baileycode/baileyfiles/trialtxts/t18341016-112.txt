            . I am a seaman
, and belong to the Snaresbrook, which was lying off the Tower. The prisoner joined the ship four days before I went ashore - I left my clothes on deck, in my chest, and left the prisoner on board - on Friday morning I returned, at six o'clock, and my clothes were all gone - I gave information to Thompson - the prisoner had left the ship - I found him in the skittle-ground of a public-house, with my jacket on his back- I lost two blankets, one rug, and three shirts besides - I have come all the way from Hambro' to prosecute him.

            . I am a policeman. I found the prisoner at the Cross Keys, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, with the jacket on, which Birch claimed - and at the station-house he had a shirt on belonging to the apprentice of the ship, and a pair of trowsers belonging to another man in the ship - he said to me, "I am guilty of taking the things - I sold them between two streets in Rosemary-lane, to two Jewesses" - in the lining of his hat I found 4s. 6d.(Property produced and sworn to.)

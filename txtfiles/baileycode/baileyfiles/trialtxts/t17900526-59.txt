On the 21st of May, I had my pocket picked in Long-lane, Smithfield


, going towards Aldersgate-street. I felt the prisoner take my handkerchief, and saw him go away with the handkerchief in his hand; and I pursued him; it was in my coat pocket: by the assistance of Ryland, I took him; I saw Ryland take the handkerchief from him; I never lost sight of him: the constable has the handkerchief.
- RYLAND sworn.
I saw the prisoner attempt to pick the prosecutor's pocket: Mr. Swan felt him; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief; I took him, and gave the handkerchief to the constable.

Prisoner. My witnesses are not here; I did not expect to be tried to day.

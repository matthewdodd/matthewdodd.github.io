CHARLES WINDUS TILEY
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.


MR. ESPINASSE
conducted the Prosecution.





ROBERT GARLAND
. I am cashier to Cox and Co., wholesale hosiers, in Wood-street, Cheapside. On the 14th of July I paid the prisoner 6l. 10s., and on the 13th of October, 4l. 11s., on account of hit master, Mr. Cooper.





ROBERT BAMFORD
. I am cashier to Ward-and Co., wholesale hosiers, in Wood-street. On the 13th of October I paid the prisoner 5l. 8s. 6d. for Mr. Cooper.





WILLIAM THOMAS COOPER
. I am a warehouseman, in Aldermanbury. The prisoner was in my service in July and October last—he had been my counting-house clerk two years and a half—it was his duty to receive the town accounts for me, and hand them over to me immediately, and then I should enter them in the cash-book—he did not account to me on the 14th of July for 6l. 10s. from Cox and Co., nor for either of the sums that have been named.





THOMAS HERDSFIELD
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner.

Prisoner. I am willing to plead guilty to receiving them, but I intended to repay them again—I have been made the dupe of some gamblers—I was obliged to accept two bills—they followed me up, and induced me to take these sums—the prosecutor can speak to my character.





WILLIAM THOMAS COOPER

re-examined. He has been with me two years and a half—he bore a good character—I had a good character with him—I have only his own statement that he has got into bad company.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

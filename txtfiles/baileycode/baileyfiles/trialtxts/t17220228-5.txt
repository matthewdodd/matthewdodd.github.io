            . It appeared that 3 Carts were order'd to carry Malt from Mr. Atkins's, (at Paul's Wharf) to Mr. Templer's, in Oldstreet; and one of them coming through Jewen street, stood still, with four Sacks in it, and a Man was seen to deliver a Sack hard by. The Prosecutor upon search found 4 Sacks in the said House. The Maid Servant depos'd, that Bird askt her to let him leave a Sack there, which he did, and in 2 or 3 Hours brought in 3 more.

             then came in and drank with him. Mr. Atkins depos'd, that examining the 3 Carmen, he found none but Jones that went into Jewin Street, which was out of the way to Old street. This the Prosecutor confirm'd. Mr. Templer's Servant depos'd, that the Malt that was coming up that Day, came 2 Quarters short of what he expected. Bird own'd he took the Malt out of the Cart, but said it was by Jones's Order. Jones said he deliver'd all the Sacks he received at the Wharf, according to order; and that going through Jewin Street, Bird askt him to drink. He brought several to his Reputation. The Jury 

               acquitted
             him, and found Bird 

               guilty of Felony
            .,

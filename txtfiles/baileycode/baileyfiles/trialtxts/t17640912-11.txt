            . On the 1st of August I was reading an advertisement at the register-office window at the corner of St. Dunstan's church


: I found my pocket moving; I felt and miss'd my handkerchief (a linen one) out of my pocket. I saw no body near me but the prisoner; he was about three or four yards distance. I directly charged him with taking it; he denied it at first, but finding me resolute, he pulled the handkerchief out of his breeches and gave it to me. (Produced and deposed to.) I charged Mr. 
               
                  Charlton
               


             a constable with him, and he was committed.

. I was going to St. Dunstan's church; I saw a pocket handkerchief lying on the ground. I took and put it in my waistcoat pocket; when the gentleman said he had lost his handkerchief, I said, if it is your handkerchief, here it is.

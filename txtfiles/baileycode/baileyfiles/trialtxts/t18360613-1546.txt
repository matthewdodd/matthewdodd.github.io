1546. 




MATTHEW M'CULLOCH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of June, 1 cloak, value 10s., the goods of 




George Bilney.






GEORGE BILNEY
. I am a schoolmaster, and live at Kensal-green. On the 15th of June I gave the prisoner into custody—that is all I know.





WILLIAM OLIVER
. I go to school at Mr. Bilney's. This is my cloak—I am nearly twelve years old—I saw it safe few days before it was taken—it hung up in the hall.





WILLIAM WOOD
. About eight o'clock on the 15th of June, I was passing Mr. Bilney's house, and saw the prisoner go in—I do not know how long he staid—I did not see him come out—I gave information about it.





RICHARD HUBBARD
. I am a policeman. I received information he Wood, and went to Mr. Bilney's front gate—I saw the gate and door open—I ran up the steps, and saw the prisoner coming from the further part of the hall towards the door, with the cloak under his arm—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he made no answer—I asked again, and he said, "I came to light my pipe"—I said, "What have you under your arm?" and seized him with the cloak—he struggled, but with a little assistance I got the hand-cuffs on him—when I came near the canal he ran on the bank with the hand-cuff on, and said, "Here goes for the water"—I said, "Here goes one that will follow you"—he jumped in—I jumped in after him, caught hold of his coat, and pulled him down—we were out of our depth, and to detain him, I put him under the water again—at last I found the bottom with my foot, and succeeded in getting him ashore—he was quite sober.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the rail-road, and was very tipsy—I did not know what I was doing—I asked a man where I could light my pipe—he said there was a house next door—I went in, and finding something down on the ground, I picked it up, and put it on the chair, and the policeman took me into custody.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

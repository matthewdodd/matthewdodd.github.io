            . I am a Police-officer. I was in Whitechapel about eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 5th of June; I saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, near Petticoat-lane - I suspected he had not come by it honestly, and asked what he had got; he said Nothing, and wanted to go on; I took the bundle, and found these two sheets of lead - I detained him.

            . I was with Vann. I took the lead to the prosecutor's building - it fitted exactly.
WILLIAM DEMPSEY. This building belonged to me - it is the carcase of a house at Stepney


; I had seen the lead safe two days before - I did not see it fitted.

            . I am a plumber. On the 5th of June the officer brought the lead to me; I went and compared it with the place where I had laid it down; I am quite certain it is the same lead which I had laid down- here are 24lbs.; there was about 1 cwt. and a half taken ltogether.

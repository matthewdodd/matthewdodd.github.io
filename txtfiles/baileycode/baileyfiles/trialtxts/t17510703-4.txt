            . On the 5th of June the prisoner asked me leave to go down into my yard, and I gave him leave, but instead of that he run into the kitchen where my linen was lying, I order'd him out, and he went down the yard. After this my maid went for a pail of water into the yard, and came back and said, the cock was gone, and the water running about. The prisoner was then in the house, he was searched and my cock was found in his breeches. It was produced in court and depos'd to.

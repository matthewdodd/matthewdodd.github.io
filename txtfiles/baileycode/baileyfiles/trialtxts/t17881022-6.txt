I am a carpenter
; on the 12th of August, I lost a saw from my master's shop, in Fleet-lane


; I had it on the 12th, at seven in the evening, and left it in the shop, and when I came to work in the morning, it was gone; it was found on the prisoner the next morning.

I am a constable; I took the prisoner on the 13th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, at an old iron shop in Cow-cross; I saw him there, and had suspicion of him; he had a bag; I asked him what he had in it, and he said, nothing; I searched the beg, and found three saws, he said, a man had given them to him to sell; I found out whose they were, on the 15th; I have had the saws ever since.

SELINA WELLESLEY
 was indicted

for a misdemeanor.






JAMES HUGHES
. I keep a shop in Red Lion-street, Holborn. I am in the habit of supplying goods to persons who produce a card from Ripsher and Co., haberdashers—on the 17th of June the prisoner brought this card, and threw it down on my table—I delivered to her a pair of boots, a pair of shoes, and a pair of clogs.—(The card was here put in and read as follows.) S. Rips her and Co., linen and woollen-drapers, hatters, hosiers, &c, No. 18, Lisle-street, Leicester-square."—On the back of it.—" 10, Red Lion-street, Holborn, June 2nd, '42.—Mr. Hughes, Let the bearer, Mrs. Singleton, have shoes. H. 405, for S. Rips her.—H. S."





HENRY RIPSHER
. I am in the habit of dealing with Mr. Hughes—this is my brother's card, and the writing on it is the writing of the young man in his shop, but it has the name of Singleton on it, not the prisoner's.





JOSEPH SINGLETON
. I had this card—the prisoner was living with me, but she absconded on the 17th of June, and took this card out of my drawer, and got the things—I never authorized her to get them.


Prisoner. This is a man of bad character—I knew him a length of time before I went to his house—he wanted to live with me—he lived on my prostitution. Witness. I am a married man—my wife took her in when she was quite destitute, and she robbed us shamefully—she took this card out of my drawer, and took a table-cloth at the same time—I had a child lost the same day that she absconded, on the 17th of June, and here is an advertisement for my child—(producing a placard)—my child was sent home in a cab six days after, very nearly naked.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years,

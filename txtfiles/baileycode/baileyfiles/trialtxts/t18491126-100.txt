GEORGE EDIKER



, stealing 2 sixpences; the moneys of 



Joseph Frederick Varley: having been before convicted.






MARIAN VARLEY
. I am the wife of Joseph Frederick Varley, of Chelsea. On 26th Oct. I heard the shop-door bell ring, about nine o'clock, and before I turned into the shop I heard the till shut—the prisoner was standing near the till, and there was no one else there—he asked if I had got any dust—I said, "No, not this morning"—he was turning out of the shop-door; I ran to the till, and missed two marked sixpences, which I had seen a few minutes before.

Prisoner. Q. Why did not you speak to me in the shop? A. I wished to see whether you had taken anything—I called you back; you came, and I shut the shop-door, and stood outside, and called a neighbour—the two marked sixpences were found on you—these are them.





JOHN CADDY
 (policeman, B 51). I took the prisoner—I found these two sixpences on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I turned out three sixpences and one shilling on the

counter, before the lady; she did not look at them; when the officer came, he made me turn them out again, and he said, "There is no swearing to money without a mark;" the lady said, "Let me look at the money again," and then she found these two sixpences.





HENRY HILL
 (policeman, B 176). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted March, 1847, having been before convicted, confined one year, and once whipped)—the prisoner it the person. 


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

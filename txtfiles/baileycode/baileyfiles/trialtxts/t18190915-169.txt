            . I am a working silversmith
, and live in St. John-square


. About seven o'clock in the evening a drunken woman was at a public-house there, which created a crowd - I desired them not to ill treat her; the prisoner was one of the mob, who were pushing the woman. While I was speaking to the landlord, the prisoner put his hand into my pocket. I felt him, turned round, collared him, and he dropped my handkerchief.

            . I have the care of a house in Great Smith Street, Westminster

            ; it is an empty house; it was robbed of some lead, on the 27th of March from the garret windows; both the back and fore fronts were covered with lead instead of tyles; we call it doomers; it was safe at seven o'clock on the 27th of March. I found these two pieces of lead (producing them) at Mr. Whitehead's; I tried them, and they matched exactly the place from whence the lead was stolen; the prisoner was a bricklayer's labourer
, and worked on the top of this house on the 27th of March; he did not come to work the next day, but went to work at another place.

             deposed that he was in the kitchen belonging to the house, that he heard the lead fall, and went into the street, that he took the lead from the prisoner and put it into his uncle's house.

The prisoner said in his defence that some people threw the lead down, and he knew nothing of the matter.
Whitehead. There was no body on the house but the prisoner.

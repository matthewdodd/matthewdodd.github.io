1206. 




JOHN WATSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of April, 1 dressing-glass, value 20s., the goods of 



George Tyrrell.






GEORGE TYRRELL
. I keep a carver and gilder's shop in Chancery-lane. I was going into the shop on the 11th of April, and met the prisoner with a dressing-glass—he seemed confused—I turned to look at him—he put down the glass, and ran away—I pursued, and took him—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person? A. Yes—I did not lose sight of him—I took him in Gray's Inn-square—he turned the corner of the square—I lost sight of him, but he was still running, and had a long white apron on—I swear positively to him—there is an inner door to my shop—he was between the two doors—the inner door was open—I was outside between him and the street—I was not aware that he had stolen the glass till he ran away—he put it down on the step of the door.





MARIA TYRRELL
. I am the daughter of George Tyrrell. I heard a sound from the street, that appeared as if the door was open—I had seen it shut before—I went down, and saw the dressing-glass on the step.





JOHN PETTIT
 (police-constable E 125.) The prisoner was given to me—I have the glass.

Cross-examined. Q. Was there a crowd in Gray's Inn-square"? A. There might be forty or fifty people.

MR. PHILLIPS to GEORGE TYRRELL. Q. Did you stop the prisoner? A. No—I do not know who did—I dare say there was forty or fifty persons—I was not mistaken in him—if I lost sight of him, it was not above a yard or two—he crossed the road from Holborn, and turned a corner—I did lose sight of him, but not so as not to know him again—those who took him brought him to my shop—I went along with them to see if the glass was there.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

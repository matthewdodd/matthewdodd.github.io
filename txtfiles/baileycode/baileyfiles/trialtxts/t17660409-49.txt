            , a linen-draper
 in Cheapside


. On Tuesday morning last the prisoner came into our warehouse, about 8 o'clock; she went out in a great hurry; I knowing she had no business there, followed her to the lane end, and saw her go up the lane; I returned into the warehouse again, and then went out a second time, and saw her coming with 2 pieces of linen in her hand. As soon as she saw me, she throwed down the goods, and endeavoured to make her escape. I went and seized her directly; and a constable being just by, I gave him charge of her. (The 2 pieces produced, and deposed to as his master's property, his mark being upon them.) These lay on a chest, or dresser, near the door where she came in.

            . I saw the prisoner have the linen under her arm; she dropped them down under my window; she ran back as soon as she saw Mr. Dobson coming, and cried, Moggy: he soon secured her.
Prisoner's defence.
There was another woman along with me; they let her go, and took me.

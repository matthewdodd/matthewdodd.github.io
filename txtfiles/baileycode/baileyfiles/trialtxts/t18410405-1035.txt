 was indicted

for stealing, on the

HENRY BRAND
. I live in Upper East Smithfield. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 21st of March, I was in the Minories—I received information from a friend—I felt in my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had used it a quarter of an hour before—I did not see the prisoner before.





ROBERT CROPLEY
. I was in the Minories—I saw the prisoner come behind the prosecutor, lift up his coat-tail, and draw the handkerchief out with the same hand—I hallooed, "Stop thief"—he ran away—he was taken—the handkerchief was not found on him—I am sure he is the person who took it.





JOSEPH BARRETT
 (City police-constable, No. 546.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief "—I saw the prisoner throw this handkerchief down while I was pursuing him.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and was running after the person—the policeman stopped me in turning the corner.





THOMAS GREENHAM
 (City police-constable, No. 282.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

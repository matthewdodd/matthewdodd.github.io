                  THOMAS 
                  HALIFAX
               



            , Esq.
 sworn. - I am partner with Sir Richard-Carr Glynn, 
               
                  Charles 
                  Gill

            ; a Bank-note, No. 8881, dated 23d August, 1803, for 50l. appeared on the books on the 3d of September.


                  RICHARD 
                  SEWELL
               



             sworn. - I was cashier to Sir Richard-Carr Glynn and Co. On the 3d of September, on that day, I found a deficiency of50l. I traced it, by checking over all the check articles of the day entered, and all the 50l. notes, and found one deficient; we then copied down the number of every note of 50l. that came into the house on Thursday and Friday, to check them against every note we had paid away, and discovered one note of 50l. had come in twice, without being paid away at all, No. 9140, to the best of my recollection, which created suspicion, and I examined who had paid them in, and found it was entered in the prisoner's collection first, and then in Mr. Allen's; the entry is No. 9140, on the 23d of August; Mr. Allen is a collecting clerk; these are Goldsmith's books; on the 3d of September, there is no such note for 50l. No. 8881, in our book; I carefully examined the books, to see whether there was, or not.
Court. Q. Do all the collecting clerks come back at the same time? - A. No, there was a difference of about three quarters of an hour; in point of order, O'Hara's account was first entered; I sent for Mr. Parry, and there it rested till Monday morning, when Mr. Hallifax was informed of it, and there it rested again till three o'clock on Tuesday, when an anonymous letter was brought in by Mr. O'Hara, addressed to the head cashier of the house of Sir Richard-Carr Glynn, inclosing a 50l. Bank of England note; I gave them both to Mr. Halifax, after putting my mark on them, (a letter and note shewn to the witness); these are the same; the note is No. 9550, dated 24th August, 1803.
(Letter read.)
"To the head cashier of the house of Sir Richard-Carr Glynn and Co.
"You paid me two 50l. notes for one on Saturday; I would have you be careful for the future."(Note read, No. 9550, for 50l. dated 24th August, 1803.)
Court. Q. Had you been possessed of a note of the last number and date? - A. No, not till it came with the letter.

                  BROWN
               



             sworn. - I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Newnham and Co. I paid this note, No. 9550, to a clerk of the house of Messrs. Glynn and Co. most likely to the prisoner, but I cannot say; the entry is Glynn; I paid it in exchange for twenty country notes, on the 6th of September; it was paid by a 50l. note, No. 9550, and several small notes; the person gave me country notes to the amount of 47l. 12s. and a 5l. Bank of England note, No. 2624, which made 52l. and I gave the 50l. note, and the others small notes.

             sworn. - I am entering clerk to Messrs. Glynn and Co. On the 3d of September, the prisoner rendered his accounts, in which was the note, No. 9140, for 50l. dated the 23d of August, and the same note is entered in Mr. Allen's collection on the same day; I passed it in Mr. O'Hara's account, and went to dinner at six o'clock, and on my return, I found Mr. Allen's ready for entry, and correct.
Q.In Allen's account, did you enter a note, No. 8881, for 50l.? - A. There is no such number.


                  THOMAS 
                  ALLEN
               



             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Glynn and Co. On the 3d of September, I rendered my account of the notes I had received that day, but had no note, No. 9140.
- DAVIS sworn. - I am clerk in the Bank of England, and exchanged the 50l. note, No. 8881, dated the 23d of August, on the 5th of September, to a person of the name of Thompson, and the name of Thompson is on the back of it; I paid two 10l. notes, Nos. 4128 and 4129, dated the 22d of August, 1803, four 5l. notes, No. 1116 to 1119, dated the 25th of August, and ten 1l. notes, Nos. 4225 to 4234, dated the 24th of August.
Q.(To Carter.) Have you seen the prisoner write, and do you believe the name of Thompson to be his writing? - A. It resembles his writing very much, and to the best of my belief, it is his.
Q.(To Allen.) Look at the name of Thompson and Harris on the note, No. 9550, and say, whether you believe it to be the prisoner's writing? - A. Yes.

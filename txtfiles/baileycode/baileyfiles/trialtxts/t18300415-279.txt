            's husband's name is Thomas - this property belonged to a person who had come in; I did not know it was stolen till afterwards.

            . I am porter to 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Dixon
               



            , who lives in Cockspur-street. I had this property in a parcel to take to Sloane-street, on the 20th of February - I went into the Queen's Head, at Knightsbridge


, about two o'clock; I sat in the tap-room, nearly three quarters of an hour, with the parcel in my possession; I then went to the bar to speak to Clarke; I returned in two minutes, and the parcel was gone from the table where I had left it; I could hear nothing of it in the house - I cannot swear the prisoner was there; this was Saturday, and on the Tuesday I found it at a pawnbroker's.


                  WILLIAM 
                  CHURCH
               



            . I am an officer. On the 22nd, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and found this duplicate under a chimney ornament, on the mantel-piece - he was then in custody; I knew he lodged there, for I saw him there on Sunday, the 21st, about another case - he wasthen with me.


                  JOHN 
                  KILLINGWORTH
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Perkins, pawnbroker, of King's-road, Chelsea. I have a piece of silk pawned for 12s. on the 20th of February - I have a recollection of having seen the prisoner before, but am not quite positive he is the man; this duplicate is what I gave the person.


                  JOHN 
                  BUCKERIDGE
               



            . I am in the employ of Bell and Co., silk-manufacturers. I know this silk to be their make, and believe it to be part of the goods sent to Dixon and Evans from our house; this invoice is what I sent with the goods.


                  JOHN 
                  ROYLE
               



            . I have every reason to believe this to be part of the contents of the parcel; it had come for Bell and Co. - I lost the parcel about a quarter to three o'clock.


                  WILLIAM 
                  JAMES WILSON
               



            . On Saturday, the 20th of February, the prisoner came to my master's shop in Piccadilly, for some black varnish - I am a brass-finisher; he took off his hat and took a piece of black silk from it- I asked him what it was for; he said for a handkerchief, and said I should have one for 5s. - I said I did not want it; he put it into his hat again - I knew him before; he was groom to Mr. Murray; it was about four o'clock.
Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Murray pays us at this public-house, and we run a weekly score there; I had a post of half-and-half there that day from our foreman - I had a black silk handkerchief in my hut, with two 1d. loaves and a piece of cheese; my hat fell off in the street - I picked up the handkerchief at the time.

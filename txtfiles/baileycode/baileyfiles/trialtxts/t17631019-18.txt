            . There was some potash left under my care upon the Key, I am a porter employed by masters of vessels to take care of what is landed from their vessels, and send them home to the merchants houses. On the 7th of this instant, between 8 and 9 in the morning, I saw the prisoner very busy, and detected him with his two pockets full of potash to the amount of 12 lb. there was a hogshead of potash open, and upon examining it found betwixt 2 and 300 weight out of it.
Prisoner's Defence.
A young man was taking some, and said it was good to wash dirty aprons in, so I being in liquor, took some, I did not know what it was good for.

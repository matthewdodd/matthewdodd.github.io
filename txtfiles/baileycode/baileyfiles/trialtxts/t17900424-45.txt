- TURNER sworn.
I am shopman to the prosecutors. I remember the prisoners coming several times before; and on the evening before, they bought two yards of ribbon, at ten-pence a yard; they had three yards at two-pence a yard, for a cockade, and a yard of black ribbon at four-pence; and the next day they came for the cockade; and I saw her take two pieces of ribbon in her hand, and convey one piece into the skirt of the child's frock: the other, Davis, bought a yard and a half at seven-pence a yard, and paid me; and they went out of the shop; I followed them out, and said they had something they should not; they said, what; I brought them back; and Wynne turned out her pockets, and desired me to search her; I said I was not proper to search her; and I called up the maid; then she searched the child in my presence; and I saw a piece of ribbon drop from the child; I picked it up.

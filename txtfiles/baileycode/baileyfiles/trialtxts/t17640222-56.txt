. On Tuesday the 14th of February, about six in the evening, there was the prisoner and another man stood in the front of Mr. Cook's window, I heard the glass break, and saw the prisoner's hand come from the window, and a piece of cloth in it; there was a hole broke big enough to put a hand in, his back was towards me; I took him in my arms, and carried him into the shop: he dropped the handkerchiefs, and I took them up. (Produced in court, and deposed to by Mr. Cook.)

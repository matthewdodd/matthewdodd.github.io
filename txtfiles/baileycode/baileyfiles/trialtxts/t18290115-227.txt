             CHADWICK. On the 28th of December I was in Drury-lane


. about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner following me; I felt a jerk at my pocket, and on turning round, saw him putting my handkerchief into his bosom - I detained him and sent for the officer.
JAMES BIRCHALL. I am an officer and took the prisoner- he said he had hard work to get the handkerchief out; that he saw them eating some dinner in the cookshop, and he thought he would take the handkerchief to get some.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He says he saw me following him, and I was looking into a cookshop; I saw his handkerchief hanging partly out of his pocket and it was pinned with this pin - I took hold of it to make him ashamed of himself for having it pinned; I saw the people eating and making mouths one at another, and I thought I would have some.

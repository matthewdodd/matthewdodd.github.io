ANN PARKER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of May, 1 bonnet, value 5s.; 1 shawl, value 3s.; 2 gowns, value 14s.; 1 cap, value 1s.; 1 pair of gloves, value 6d.; 2 caps, value 3d.; and 2 saucers, value 3d.; the goods of 



Ann Wigforth.






ANN WIGFORTH
. I live in Upper Lisson-street. The prisoner came to lodge with me for the night about four weeks ago—she did not come borne next night; but the next night she came to me for the key of her room to get her bonnet, and after she was gone, I missed all the articles stated—she is a shirt maker—I had a good character with her—I have only recovered the bonnet and shawl.





MATTHEW REARDON
. I am a policeman. I heard of the robbery; and from information, about half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 8th of June, I went to No. 19, Little Exeter-street, Hackney-grove—I went into a room there, and found the prisoner sitting in a chair—a young man was in bed in the room—I told the prisoner I wanted her for a robbery in Upper Lisson-street—I took her to the station-house, and asked where she lived—she said she could not tell, but she did not commit the robbery—I found the shawl and bonnet on her.

Prisoner's Defence. The bonnet did not belong to the prosecutrix, and the shawl she lent me—she gave me leave to do what I did.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

1491. 




JOHN JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



William Smith, from his person.






WILLIAM SMITH
. About eleven o'clock on the 9th of May I was in Thames-street, near Billingsgate, I felt a pull at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner going off—I took him, and found my handkerchief in a long pocket in his trowsers—he said first that I did not take it from him, and then he said he had found it.

Prisoner. I picked it up on the pavement, against a herring shop. Witness. It is quite impossible that I could have dropped it, not a second elapsed before I took him.





OLIVER DEATH
 (City police-constable, No. 447.) I took the prisoner—there was no dirt on the handkerchief, though it was a very dirty day.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

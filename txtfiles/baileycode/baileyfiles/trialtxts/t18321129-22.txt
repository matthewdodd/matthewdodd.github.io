            . I keep an establishment
 at Uxbridge



 - my school-house is within the curtilage of my dwelling-house; there is a fence all round it; it is about forty yards from my dwelling-house - I can go to it without going into the public-road. On the Friday morning, soon after I rang the bell for the young gentlemen to leave their rooms, I missed from my school a number of pens, some copy-books, and other things; my pupils gave me information of the robbery; they found it out themselves; I went, in consequence of information, to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hewett
               



            's house, at Amersham - I found her at home; Richard Hewett had been in custody from the Friday before - I told Mary Hewett we came to search the house, where I knew the property was concealed - she said the only bundle she had brought from Uxbridge was an Evangelical magazine, and a gown; she exhibited them both on the table - she distinctly said she had no other property about the house, and that she had left Uxbridge before there was any disturbance; we searched the house, and the officer found some old copybooks, and a mahogany box, in which one of my pupil's money had been kept before it was broken open - it was concealed under some beech rafters, under a staircase, and done with so much art, that you would not suppose the beech rafters had been removed for ten years; there were some rags, old bits of iron, and other things thrown over them - when they were found, she exclaimed, "What has my son brought me to!" or something of that kind; she told me she had slept on the Thursday night at a public-house a great way up Uxbridge, on the left-hand side, and her son had slept in the same room with her; that he had come to bed some time after her, and did not leave the room till the next morning.

            . I am servant to Dr. Beazley. On the night of the Thursday all the windows of the school were shut down, and the door fastened - I was the first down the next morning; I received information, and went to the premises - I found some footmarks leading from the school-room to a meadow, about one hundred and fifty yards off, where I found this bundle of quills; I watched till about half-past eight o'clock, and then saw Richard Hewett come searching about the place - I had the quills then in my possession; I asked him to come with me, and took him into custody - his shoes were taken off before Dr. Beazley, and compared with the footmarks.
COURT. Q. Did you see marks of any person having been inside the school? A. Yes, and some books were thrown about; the windows were all shut down the night before, the room locked, and I had the key in my pocket.

            . I am high-constable of Uxbridge. On Friday, the 19th of October. I went and saw the footmarks - I took the shoes off 
               
                  Richard 
                  Hewett
               



            's feet, and fitted them to the marks - there are some nails out of one shoe, and the marks exactly corresponded.
Richard Hewett. Q. How many footmarks did you find? A. There were several marks, but I could only try one, which was close under the window - there had been rain all the morning.

            . I am a pupil
 of Dr. Beazley's. I lost from the school-room a small mahogany box, which contained a penknife, a half-sovereign, and two or three shillings in silver; I found the box at 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hewett
               



            's, under some old rafters - this is it; the pen-knife is in it, but the money was gone.

            . I am constable of Amersham. I went to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hewett
               



            's house; I found this box and some copy-books under some wood concealed; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hewett
               



             had denied having any property there, except the gown and the Evangelical Magazine; when these things were found, she said "What trouble my son has brought me to."

                  LLOYD
               



            . I keep the Jolly Ostlers, public-house at Uxbridge. The prisoners slept at my house in the same room on the Thursday night; the mother went to bed about ten o'clock, and the son came home about one or two in the morning.

            . I am an officer. I had 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hewett
               



             in custody; she told me she was surprised how Dr. Beazeley should know, or have any suspicion of her having any thing at her house; and she said that her son gave her the bundle on the Friday morning, that she did not know what it contained till she got to Amersham, and then she found there was a little mahogany box in it, and some copy-books; she said she afterwards heard her son was in custody, and that was her reason for putting it under the wood.
DR. BEAZLEY. These copy-books and pens are mine; I bought the pens a few days before, and examined them particularly, because I bought them of a Jew; my school-room windows swing in the middle, and fasten with a button; my house is in the parish of Hillingworth.

            's Defence. I had been out spending the evening at a public-house, and on going to Mr. Lloyd's to sleep, I saw two men rush out of Mr. Cox's park, and drop a bundle - I thought it was game, and took it up; I found what the contents were, and put them into my pocket - I gave it to my mother in the morning.
MR. LLOYD. He had no bundle when he came to my house, that I saw.

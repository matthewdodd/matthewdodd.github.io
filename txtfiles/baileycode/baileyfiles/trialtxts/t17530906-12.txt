            . On Thursday last I lost a copper tea-kettle from off my chimney-piece in the kitchen.
Q. When had you seen it last?
Stevens. I am sure it was there the night before, I know nothing of the taking it; but on the morning of the 30th, the prisoner and the tea-kettle were brought into my house, where he own'd that he and two other lads took it, and that he and one of them went into my kitchen and took it to sell for money to buy victuals.

            . I met the prisoner just by Halbourn bridge, and suspecting he did not come honestly by the tea-kettle he had got, so I took him and it, and by enquiring found out the prosecutrix's house, and delivered the tea-kettle to Mrs. Stevens, I had seen the prisoner and two other boys idling about some time in the street.
Q. to Mrs. Stevens. Is this the same tea-kettle which that evidence delivered to you?
Stevens. It is, my lord.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.




               Guilty 10 d

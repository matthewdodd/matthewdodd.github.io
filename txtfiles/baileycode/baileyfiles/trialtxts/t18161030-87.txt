            . On the 21st of October, I lost my seal; soon after five in the afternoon, I was walking down Drury-lane


, and a short distance from the corner of Long Acre, I saw the prisoner, and several others. The prisoner staggered against me, and holding forward his left arm which came against my breast, and with his right hand he seized my watch chain, and ran off. I immediately pursued him, and just at he entrance of Parker's-lane, a person came violently in contact with me, and threw me down; I called stop thief loudly, and just as the prisoner passed Mr. Davy's, the wheelwright, he was stopped.

            . I am a wheelwright. Seeing the prisoner running and hearing the cry of stop thief, I stopped him. Mr. Turner came up, and charged him with this offence, and another man came up and seized Mr. Turner, and shook him violently. I told that man if he did not go about his business I would take him into custody also. We took the prisoner into a public-house, and searched him, but nothing was found on him.

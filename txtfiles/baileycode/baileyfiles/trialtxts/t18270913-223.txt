JOHN HENDERSON. I am a seaman
. I had some horse-hair and a bed-tick, on the 25th of August, at my house in Devonshire-street, Mile-end


. The prisoner came to the house to purchase the hair; he rolled it up, took it, and walked off with it; he left a pair of steel-yards and abag behind him - I went out, but could not see him - I am sure he is the man - I have not found it.
Prisoner. His wife called me in, and asked if I bought horse-hair. Witness. She did no such thing - I was present.
Q. I said, "You do not dispute my word, I will return bye and bye?" A. You did not.

            . I live next door to Henderson. The prisoner goes about buying old rags and iron; he came and asked if they had any thing to sell; they said some horse-hair; he took it out of the old tick, and put it into the new one; he weighed it, and called me in; he then took it on his shoulder, and went away with it; we thought he was going to put it into his bag, but he was gone.

            . I am an officer. I received information, and went and took the prisoner next morning, at his house, behind the hospital in Whitechapel.
Prisoner's Defence. I left my steel-yards and bag there; they said I might take it, and return again - I could not sell it that night; it weighed 15lbs. I said I was short of money, and could not pay then.
JOHN NORRIS. He did not say this to me.

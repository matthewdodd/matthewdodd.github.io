Q. Did you see the prisoner take the cloak? - A. No, I did not see her take it; I pursued after her, and took her up Brick-alley, and brought her back to the shop; she had the cloak tucked up her gown; I know the cloak was on the counter; a witness came and informed me of it, and I took the cloak from her.

             when he was hanging the things up; the rest of the things were taken off the counter, and this cloak was on the counter; the woman watched very much, and I watched; I turned my head as though I saw nothing about it, and when I turned my head back again, the cloak was gone off the counter; she got her half handkerchief out, and then she went out of the shop; then I made the alarm; I saw her brought back, and I saw the cloak taken from under the body of her gown.
(The cloak produced and identified by Law.)

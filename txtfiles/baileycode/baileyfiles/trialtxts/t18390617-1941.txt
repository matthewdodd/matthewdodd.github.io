MARY ANN HAGGER
. I am the daughter of George Hagger, of Queens street, Seven Dials. On the 18th of June, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I heard a screeching as if they were killing fowls—I went to the top of the kitchen stairs and saw Ovens shut the door from the inside—I instantly ran to the street-door and called the policeman—Ovens followed me—I caught hold of him—he struck me several times and got from me—Mills then pushed by me and got out—they were both taken in a few minutes—I knew nothing of them before—we keep our fowls in the cellar—I went to look at them, and found these tied up in a bag—they had been all safe when I went to bed the night before.





JOSEPH THOMPSON
. I am a policeman—I heard a cry for the police, and saw Ovens striking Hagger—Mills ran by her—I ran and took Ovens—there was a key found in the prosecutor's street door, which does not belong to it—I found seven hens in a bag drawn up.





WILLIAM BOFFIN
. I am a policeman—I heard the alarm, and found Mills in a water-closet—I took him back to the house, and my brother officer had Ovens.

Ovens's Defence. I was standing by the door, and this young woman collared me—I pushed her—she tore my coat—I went off, and the officer took me.

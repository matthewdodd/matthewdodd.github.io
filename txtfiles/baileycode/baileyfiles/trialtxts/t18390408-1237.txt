CHARLES MERRICK
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
5th of March, 6lbs. weight of pork, value 3s., the goods of 



Jane Wing.






JANE WING
. I live in John's-row, St. Luke's—I am a widow, and keep a pork-shop. On the 10th of March, I had two bellies of pork, one on each side of my window—I saw them safe a minute before one of them was taken—I merely walked into my room from the shop, when a little girl called me, and told me something—I ran to the door, and a witness brought back the prisoner, and the pork, which was one of the bellies I had in my shop.





GEORGE STOCKSLEY
. I am a butcher, and live in Bath-street, opposite John's-row. I saw the prisoner and three others come down John's-row—they stopped near my shop—the prisoner then went and took the pork out of the prosecutrix's window—one of the other boys took it from him as soon as he had taken it out of the window—they came towards ray shop—I took the prisoner, and the other boy threw down the pork—one of the other boys picked it up, but they were pursued, and he dropped it again

—a man took it up, and gave it to me, and I took it back—the other bow escaped.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw two boys go and take the pork—they began to run, and this man took me—I am innocent.




GUILTY
. * Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

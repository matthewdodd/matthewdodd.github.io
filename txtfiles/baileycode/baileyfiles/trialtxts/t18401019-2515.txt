MARY HARRINGTON
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of October, 1 gown, value 4s. 6d., the goods of 



George Smellie.






WILLIAM WALTER WILMIN
. On the 1st of October the prisoner came to our shop about three o'clock in the afternoon—this gown was hanging up on a row of gowns—she came to the counter with two tickets, for a gown and shawl, and asked me if the ticket of a petticoat was among then—I said not—she left the shop, and returned with a ticket of a petticoat and shawl, and asked if the ticket of a gown was among them—I said, "No, you foolish woman, you brought the ticket of a gown in just now"—she stood about some time, and then went out, and as I passed by, to go to my tea, at four o'clock, I missed the gown—about seven o'clock is the evening I saw her come into the shop again—I planted a boy behind the counter to watch her—I also got over the counter to watch her—she took down another gown, rolled it up, and put it behind a sea-bed—she observed the customers looking at her, and went out of the shop without taking that gown—I hung it up again—this is the gown she took away the first time—I found it pawned at the shop of Mr. Hawes, at Ratcliff.





CHARLESS SCOTT
. I live with Mr. Hawes, a pawnbroker, in High-street. This gown was pledged by the prisoner on Thursday evening, the 1st of October.

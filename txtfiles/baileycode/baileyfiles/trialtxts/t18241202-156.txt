WILLIAM COVELL. I am servant
 to Mr. Cox. On Saturday last I was in Oxford-street


, with my cart; I ran on to ask a question of Carpenter, who was before, but on turning round I saw the prisoner pull my coat off the cart - he ran between the coaches with it; I ran between the coaches, and caught him, and said, "You have stolen my property:" he immediately dropped it, and said, "You have got your property, pray don't hurt me." I secured him.
Prisoner. Q. How far was your cart from Carpenter's? A. Not far; I saw you take it, you pulled it twice; it was a wet morning - it could not have blown off.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. I received him in charge; he said at the office that the coat was all over dirt, which it was not.
Prisoner's Defence. The coat blew off, and I picked it up. I declare solemnly that the mud was on it at the watch-house.

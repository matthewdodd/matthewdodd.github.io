             informed me he had seen our servant maid in the shop, the prisoner used to come to see her; we supposed she had robbed us, we found the prisoner concealed in her bed, she was his wife; there was nobody but me and Mr. Baker, and he run down and gave information, and the prisoner was delivered into the custody of the watchman; he was taken to the watch-house, and the officer found one of my neck-handkerchiefs round his neck; he swore a little, and said we might do our worst.

keeps a butter-shop
 in Kingsland-road


. On the 4th of May, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners loitering about his shop - I watched, and saw Edwards take a bladder of lard; Asprey stood on the other side of the shop - they ran off together; they did not go into the shop; I gave information, and they were taken with the lard - I am quite sure of their persons.

            . Wood gave me information - I went out, and saw Asprey running; I took him - this lard was brought back, which is my father's.

            . I am an officer. I was on duty, saw Asprey running from the shop, and took him into custody.
FILDER HARRIS (Police-constable N 228). I saw Asprey and another, who I believe was Edwards, standing near the prosecutor's shop - in a few minutes they were gone, and the lard likewise.

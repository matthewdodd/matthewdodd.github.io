 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
28th of February, 1 purse, value 6d.; 10 shillings, and 2 sixpences; the goods and monies of

Catherine Irvine.






CATHERINE IRVINE
. I am the wife of George Irvine—we live in Heath-street, Commercial-road. On the 28th of February I was walking with Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Teshach—we had proceeded to High-street Aldgate, when Mrs. Johnson told me something—I had had a brown silk purse with me containing about 11s., chiefly in shillings, and there were some sixpences—I could not say how many—I put my hand into my pocket, and my purse was gone.





ELIZABETH JOHNSON
. About twelve o'clock, on the 28th of February, I was with Mrs. Irvine, and when we were in Aldgate I saw the prisoner taking Mrs. Irvine's purse out of her pocket—it was partly in his hand, and partly in her pocket—there were several young men who crowded round us, but I am sure the prisoner is the person who had the purse in his hand—I took hold of him—he passed the purse to another, and it is gone.

Prisoner. Q. Was there not a person by my side who put his hand around me? A. No.

Prisoner. Yes, there was, and that was the person who had the purse—I did not take it out of the pocket.





MART TESCHACH
. I was walking with Mrs. Irvine, and we were surrounded by five or six young men, one of whom made a twitch at my bag—I turned, and saw Mrs. Johnson holding the prisoner.





JOHN AMBROSE
 (City police-constable. No. 28.) I saw a crowd, and went up—I saw the prisoner in custody of Mrs. Johnson—he had a Mackintosh on his arm—I found upon him a knife, and 3d. in copper.

Prisoner. I am innocent—there was no purse found on me.

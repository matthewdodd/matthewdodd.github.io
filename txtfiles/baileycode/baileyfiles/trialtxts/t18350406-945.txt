 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
14th of March, 3 caps, value 10s.; 1 pair of scissors, value 6d.; 4 yards of ribbon, value 1s.; 1 frock-sleeve, value 2d.; 1 handkerchief, value 2d.; 1 collar, value 1s.; and a quarter of a yard of muslin, value 1d.; the goods of 



Elizabeth Dean, her mistress.






ELIZABETH DEAN
. I am single, and live in Regent-street, St. James's. The prisoner was my servant of all work, from the 10th to the 15th of March—we had hired her by the year—on the Friday evening she got dreadfully intoxicated, and I gave her warning—on the Saturday morning she got intoxicated again—I did not know what to do, till a friend called and advised me to send for a policeman—I sent for the prisoner's bonnet-box, and in it I found these caps, this ribbon, and this sleeve; and the other articles, the scissors and the handkerchief were in her pocket—they, are mine.





JOHN CAUNT
 (police-constable C 58.) I was sent for, and found the prisoner drunk—I took her to the station-house.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was ignorant of the property being in her box, and that she had put the scissors into her Pocket, not having a pair of her own.)




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

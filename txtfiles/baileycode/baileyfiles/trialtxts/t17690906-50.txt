. The prisoner lived servant
 with me about eight months. I was not in town at the time these things were lost; but coming to town the 13th of July, and missing the things mentioned, I suspected her, and challenged her with taking them. She stiffly denied it, but the next morning I had a warrant of suspicion. After it was served upon her, she owned to the taking of them, and that she had tied them up in a table cloth, and delivered them to a sailor, an acquaintance of hers. We never could find him, and have never got the things again. I took her before Justice Russel; she confessed the same there. I mentioned them to her separately, and she owned to them all.

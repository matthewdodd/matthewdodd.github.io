MARY ANN SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing 32 yards of printed cotton, value 18s., the goods of 



George Thomas Minor; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY EDWARD STREET
. I am in the employ of George Thomas Minor, a linen-draper, who lives at Lambeth. On the 30th of Jan. I put four pieces of printed cotton outside the window—I saw them safe between eleven and twelve o'clock—I went to take them in in the afternoon, and missed one of them—this now produced is it—it is in two pieces now.





SOPHIA COLE
. I am a pawnbroker. I took in this piece of print of the prisoner on the 30th of Jan., between six and seven o'clock in the evening.





WILLIAM AMOR
. I am a pawnbroker. I took in this piece of cotton of the prisoner on Friday, the 30th of Jan.





HENRY EDWARD STREET

re-examined. These are my master's property.

JURY. Q. Are you able to swear to it? A. Yes—I believe the prisoner was in the shop with another person, just before I missed the cotton—I swear to this by the pattern, and it has been compared with a piece I cut off it, and it corresponds exactly—I do not suppose only one person had the pattern—this pattern I have in my pocket corresponds with the width of this cotton, and it was torn off a dress that I cut off this cotton—there were thirty-nine yards and a half of it, and I cut off six yards—I should not like to swear that the prisoner was in the shop, but I could swear to the person who was with her.

The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had met her sister by Bishopsgate Church, and received the cotton from her to make dresses, and wanting to make a purchase at a bazaar, had pledged it.






THOMAS WILLIAM RADFORD
 (police-constable L 52.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Newington—(read—Convicted 14th April, 1845, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person,

                   CROSSBY
               



             sworn.
On the 23d of February I was here, on the trial of Le Gross; I staid in town all night; I live at Enfield; I went to see an acquaintance; they live in Darby-street, near Rosemary-lane; it might be half after eleven; in coming back, I lost my way; I met 
               
                  Margaret
                   Bunn
               



            , the prisoner, and asked my way into Bishopsgate-street; she said she would shew me, if I would give her a shilling; I told her I would give her sixpence, and the other sixpence when she came to the place; she took me up to a house, under a pretence of getting a candle and lanthorn; I never was in London but twice before in my life.
Was you in liquor? - No; I was sober.
Did you take any particular notice of the house, so as to know it again? - Yes, particular notice of the door; when I got out, she took a bit of candle in her hand, under pretence to light it; and she asked me to stop; and she went just within the door, and then she told me I had better sleep with her; I told her I would do no such thing, and the sixpence was no object to me; so, if she did not chuse to go, and shew me the place, I should depart; she told me there was a door opposite to this door, and there was a bed there, and I might sleep with her; I told her I would not; then she took me by the collar, and I went to resist her; and at the door where the bed was, as she said, the prisoner Patrick came in at that door; he set his back against the street-door, to keep me from going out; she then demanded fifteen shillings of me to pay this man for coming into his house; I refused, and the prisoner Patrick said he would let me off for seven shillings and sixpence, and then he would let me out; and I refused to pay that; with that, she began to pull my hat off, and throw it down; then she turned my breeches pockets inside out; the man stood all this time close within the door, within six inches, or thereabouts; I might have six or seven shillings in my pocket, I cannot say, but I am sure there was four shillings and sixpence; I refused her taking it out, and she tore my breeches all to pieces, and my pocket out too; then, after the woman did that, she turned my waistcoat pockets out; then I had a great coat over this that I have on now, and they turned the pockets of the great coat out, and there were two handkerchiefs, one in each pocket; only one handkerchief was found; then the woman took a white cambrick handkerchief from my neck, and threw that down likewise where my hat lay; then the woman ordered me to stop, and I refused to stop; then, my Lord, she tied this cambrick handkerchief round my neck, in a noose, to throttle me, because I should not follow her out; then I began to halloo; then I heard the watch crying the hour; with that, the prisoner at the bar got from the door, and I caught my hat up, and got away.
When you began to cry out, were they both standing by you? - Yes; this man just as he was at first.
What did you cry? - I cried, murder? as loud as I could; then I heard the watch, and the prisoners got from the door, and let me get out; I made the best of my way, I came to the watch-house in this condition.
While the woman was taking the things out of your pocket, did the man say any thing to you? - Only repeated that I should pay seven shillings and sixpence before I went out; he never laid a hand upon me.
Had you ever been in that house before? - Never in that part before.
Had you ever seen that man and woman before? - No.
Did you owe this man any money? - No; when I got out, I went to the watchman in that condition; he went with me, and shewed him the house; the watchman was coming along the street within a hundred yards of me; I was so frightened, I cannot say exactly; he asked me whether I knew the door; he saw I was sober; we went to the door and heard a woman and a man talking in the same house; and we went to the officer of the night, and tried to open the door, and the man from the inside said he would shoot through the door; the man and woman were not the people.
When you came back to this house, was the back door open or shut? - Open, we heard them clatter out as soon as ever we went to break the door open.
Where does that back door go to? - It went out into a brewers yard, where she wanted me to go and sleep; then we went back again, and I staid with the officer all night; then I was obliged to attend here on Le Gross's trial, and we went the next morning about nine, and we heard a talking again, and they were gone in an instant; the lad came and looked up, and before that we saw this prisoner peeping out of a house that was not furnished; we pursued and took him; that house where he was looking out of window looked into this yard; the street door of that house was bolted, and the window was pretty high, we were obliged to get in there; when we came to the top of the stairs to look for him, he was below and we took him; I am positive he was the man.
What time of the day was this when you took him? - Between eight and nine.
Did you find the woman? - No, I did not.
Is that the woman? - Yes; I am positive that is the woman; it was pretty dark when I first met her.
Where was the candle, when she was taking your things from you? - That I do not know; it was not light when they robbed me; I was robbed in the dark; there was a fire made of boards, and that flamed, you might see a pin; it was made of old paling, and bits of old tubs.
Did she never light a candle? - Yes; and I am now sure she is the woman.
Had there any familiarities passed between you and her? - No, my Lord.
Prisoner Bunn. Did not you give me one of these handkerchiefs, and eighteen pence? - No; only sixpence to shew me the way.

             sworn.
I am an officer; on the 23d of February, I had the charge of the prisoner Patrick; Crosby described the woman to me; the prisoner was in custody, she told me she had left one handkerchief at a chandler's shop just by; I took her there with me.
(The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)

                   MILLWOOD
               



             sworn.
This man, as I judge by his voice, answered he would not open the door; I said, then I will break it open; the man said, then the first that breaks open the door, he would shoot him; the officer drew back; I and another watchman pushed at the door, and one of our watchmen said, here they are; and they jumped over into the rope-walk, and escaped for that night; I did not see them that night; the next morning the prosecutor and me went to the same house again; and he said, they are in the house; I heard the voices of two persons, and they were talking as they did before; we went and got assistance; there was another door that prevented us from getting in, but I pushed the door, and I heard a rustle, and we went and looked all about, and at the window of a one pair of stairs, and at an adjoining house we saw the prisoner Patrick; we thought they got out of that door; the door was bolted at this house, we could not get in; I pushed up the window, and asked the prosecutor to come in after me; then I went up stairs, and he was not there; I looked through the window, and saw him running through the cooperage; we pursued him, and took him in Church-lane; that may be three or four hundred yards from the cooper's yard.
Who took him? - The young man, he never was out of our sight; he was runing, we did not search him.



                  JOSEPH
                   RIDER
               



             sworn.
The prisoner Bunn brought me this handkerchief the day she was taken, between eight and nine in the morning; I keep a chandler's shop in Cable-street, she said, she would leave it for eight pennyworth of shop goods; she went away; I never saw her again till Mr. Taylor came with her.
PRISONER PATRICK'S DEFENCE.
I had no hand at all in it, I know nothing at all about it, I was not concerned in it.
How came you to threaten the officer when he came to open the door? - It was not me.
Can you satisfy the Jury, that you do not live in that house? - I never was in the house before.
Where do you live? - I was lately come home from sea; I was not paid off from the shop; I had no lodging; I came home in the Vigil, Captain 
               
                  Gildard
               


            , laying at Limehouse-stairs, the man of the house gave me leave to sleep there; I did not like to go on board so late; I slept up one pair of stairs, and saw the prosecutor bring this woman into the house, but nothing improper happened; no violence.
How got you out of the house, when they got in at the window? - I staid there till the bustle was over.
PRISONER BUNN'S DEFENCE.
I was coming along, and this young man asked me to drink something; we went to the Coach and Horses, and drank some brandy, he asked me to take him to a house to sleep, and I took him to this house, and this young man gave me a shilling, and a pocket handkerchief; and said, he would come and give me another shilling; the next day I was at my sister's, and my sister went out and fastened me in.
Court to Taylor. Whose house is this? - 
               
                  Samuel
                   Hornby
               



            's.
How do you know? - I know the man that keeps the house well.

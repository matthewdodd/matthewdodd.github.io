                  Palmer 
               



            . I live in Hackney; I was at Cambridge when the things were lost, which was the 1st of October; I came home the Wednesday following; I sent my wife to Whitechapel to the Justices, they sent her to Mr. Brebrook, who had the prisoner in his custody.


                  William 
                  Botsworth 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. 
               
                  Foster
               


             a pawnbroker; I took these things in of the prisoner Hopegood, (producing a silk gown and a pair of ruffles,) she said they were her own.


                  Jane 
                  Palmer 
               



            . These are my property, I am wife to the prosecutor; I was half an hour out of the house, I was told two boys had been seen about the door; I found they had got in at the window; I found they had left my door open at coming out; all the things laid in the indictment were missing; the boy at the bar confessed at Mr. Brebrook's the other was named 
               
                  James 
                  Cooper 
               



            , and that the prisoner stood at the door while the other got in and took the things out; I found out where they were pawned by Hopegood's mother.

Betsworth. Hopegood said at Whitechapel before the Justices that Andrews gave these things to her to make away with, to do what she could with them.


                  James 
                  Brebrook 
               



            . I took the two prisoners up, and had them before Mr. Pell: Hopegood wanted to be admitte d evidence, but she had been an evidence once before, and they would not admit her; she said there that Andrews and Cooper broke a house open in a lane leading to Hackney church, and gave her these things to go to sell, by which means I found out the prosecutor; when they were at my house, Andrews said Cooper broke a pane of glass and so got in, and handed the things out much about dark.
Andrew's defence.
I was taken very ill and was at home at my mother's; I got up and went as far as Bethnal-green; I went to ease myself in a ditch, and saw something white; I walked a little further and saw this bundle of things lying, I took them up.
Hopegood's defence.
I met this young man going along, he said, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hopegood 
               



            , will you be so good as to take this gown and petticoat, and go and pawn them for me; I said, whose is it; he said it is my mother's; I went and pawned them, and had 16 s. upon them.

. On the 1st of October I was gone to market to buy a bit of meat, and when I returned about eleven or twelve in the day, I found my door open and my drawer open, and the things mentioned gone; on the Tuesday following Gilford came with Mr. Brebrook to my house; he told me he believed he had the thief that robbed me; she pulled a teaspoon out of her pocket, and acknowledged she took my things out of my house, and that Hopegood stood at the door and received them of her; Brebrook had Hopegood in custody at the same time; they were taken to Whitechapel to the Justices, there they both confessed it.

            . I am a pawnbroker; a girl brought these three tea-spoons and pledged them with me, and Hopegood stood at the door at the same time. (produced and deposed to.)

                  Brebrook 
               



            . Gilford was brought to my house by a hatter; she owned she had been concerned in robbing a house, and had one silver teaspoon upon her; I took her to the house where he said she had it from, and the prosecutrix owned the spoon: Gilford said Hopegood was concerned with her, so I took her in custody (the spoon produced)

             came to my house and desired me to pawn them things for her, as her mother was very ill, and I took and pawned them.

             sworn. - Q. What are you?
A. I have been called to the bar: On the 16th of last month, between three and four o'clock, I was robbed a few steps on this side Temple-bar


, as I was coming into the City on the Temple side of the way; there was a slight press; I felt hand go into my right hand pocket; I turned round, caught the prisoner at the bar, pulled open his surtout coat, and found two handkerchiefs, partly under his arm, and partly exposed; they were new handkerchiefs, I had just bought them. (Produces the handkerchiefs).
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Might you not have lost your handkerchiefs before you had got through Temple-bar? - A. It is scarcely possible.
Q. Did not the prisoner say he had picked them up in the street? - A. I cannot say.
The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.

            . I saw the Prisoner come out of a warehouse at Wiggins's Key with something in his pocket; I asked him what he had got there; said he, D - n you, what is that to you: his pocket hit against my leg, and that made me suspect him, so I searched him, and found eleven pound of sugar in his pockets and the lining of his coat. I went up into the warehouse, and there was the head of a hogshead open, and it seemed to be the same sugar of that hogshead. I take it to be the property of Mr. Eliakim Palmer. I would have drubbed him with a hoop stick, and have sent him about his business; but he threatened us if we meddled with him, for he said the sugar was given him at Smart's Key.

            . The Prisoner was brought to me by Mr. Day, and the sugar was taken from him. I know very little of his character; he has worked for me now and then.

            . The Prisoner stole these things from my wife, one of the aprons, the petticoat, stockings and shoes, were found upon her.
Mrs. Wood. When she was taken, she said she had pawned my gown for two shillings, and an apron for six-pence; the other apron, stockings and shoes, she had on when she was carried to the gate-house; but I found afterwards that she had sold my gown for four shillings, and my apron for a shilling.
A lodger in Mr. Wood's house proved that the Prisoner at first said before the Justice, that she had pawned the gown and apron, and afterwards confessed she had sold them.

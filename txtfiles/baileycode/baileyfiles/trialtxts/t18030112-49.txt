             proved the firm.)
WILLIAM BAILEY sworn. - I am a sadler and harness-maker, at Berkhampstead, in Hertfordshire: On the 30th of September, between nineand ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Thompson, was going by where I stood with a horse that was ill; he had been to the farrier's; I perceived the horse to be very ill, and I spoke to the prisoner, but perceiving that if he stopped the horse would lie down, I told him to go on, and I would walk by the side of him; he said he was going to take it to the Cow Roast, a public-house about two miles and a half from Berkhampstead; I asked him who the horse belonged to; he told me to 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Neale
               



            ; I desired him to tell his master, if the horse did not live, I would give as much for him as any person would; he then asked me if I bought handkerchiefs, bed-furniture, and calico; I told him, yes; he then told me he would bring me a sample of the calico in the afternoon, and asked me what time I should be at home; I appointed three o'clock; accordingly he came; my man was in the shop, and he asked me if we could not go into some other room; I took him into a little back room, and he shewed me the sample; I then cheapened them, and he set a price upon them; I agreed for 2s. a yard for the printed calico; I asked him when he would bring it, and he said twelve o'clock; I apprehended he meant twelve at night; I told him it was dark at eight; he could bring them then; he said no, he would bring them at ten; he then went about his business; I then went to a constable, and desired him to be in the way about ten o'clock; they did not bring the good that night at all; they brought them the next morning.
Q. Who do you mean by they? - A. The two prisoners and James Wright; they came between five and six o'clock; I got up about six o'clock, and Thompson and Wright came in; Gibbert stood about ten yards from the shop-door; I had opened one parcel, and conceiving they had been come by dishonestly, I removed the goods up stairs; the two men came into the little room; I asked them if they had measured the goods, and they said, no; they would sell them me by the lump; I asked them what they asked for them; they asked me 4l. I said that was cheap enough, I did not desire them cheaper; they then said, give us a pot of beer a piece; I said, I will; I had desired my man, as soon as they came for the money, to go for a constable, which he did; one of them went out, and spoke to Gibbert; he came in again, and said Gibbert was not satisfied with the price; I must give them four guineas, or they would have them measured; I agreed to give it them; I told them to go over to the Prince's Arms, I would come over to them; they said they were going to the Goat at Berkhampstead, to seed their horses, and would soon return; the constable came in, and he and I pursued them; we met them coming from the Goat, and apprehended them all; I asked them if they came honestly by the things, and they said, yes; I told them, I had apprehensions they did not come honestly by them, and I gave charge of them; they were taken before a Magistrate, and committed, (produces the calico); there are five pieces; I have had them ever since.
Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q.You are a sadler? - A. Yes.
Q. Do you deal in these articles? - A. I am in the brokery line, but I never buy any new; I frequent sales very much.
Q. Who was it you made the bargain with? - A.Thompson and Wright.
Q. Do you mean to say you saw one of them go out and speak to Gibbert? - A. Yes; mine is a bow window.
GEORGE BATEMAN sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Croughton.
Q. Look at these calicoes, and tell us if you know whose they are? - A. Yes, they are manufactured by Jackson and Co. of Bannister-Hall.
Q. What is the value of those five pieces? - A. They are worth about 3l. 10s. a piece to the retail dealer.
Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q.Jackson and Co. print for your house? - A. Yes.
Q. You have a great quantity of such goods at your house? - A. Yes.
Q. Then you don't know these from any other goods of the same description? - A. They were for shipping, and the crown mark had been omitted by mistake, and they were sent down again to have it put on, otherwise they would have been liable to be seized at the Custom-house.
Oliver. These are the same that I packed.

             sworn. - I am a boatman, and know the prisoners: On the 29th of September, I assisted in loading the boat, 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Neale
               



             commanded it, I was at work on board eight days; I got on the boat to have my dinner, and Gibbert was getting these pieces of calico out of the package; he pulled a piece of a sheeting off another package to fill it up again, and it was left in the boat; Mr. Neale was asleep.
Q. How far had you got from Paddington? - A. About eight miles, we were towing the boat all the time; about two o'clock in the day we fastened up the packages as before, I got out then to drive the horse; we came to Berkhampstead about ten o'clock in the morning, and then Thompson went into the town with a bad horse; we then all went a-shore, and each carried a parcel to the collarmaker's house; Thompson made the bargain, I was with him, Gibbert was at the door; Bailey was to give us four pounds, we informed Gibbert, who said he would have four guineas; we went back to the Goat public-house, and as we were returning for the money we were taken up.
Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. You say you went on board only to get your dinner? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not go with any intention to steal any thing? - A. No I was in the boat when they got in out, but I never meddled with it.
Q. Did you tell any body of it? - A. No.
Q. You carried a bundle? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you not expect part of the money? - A. Yes; they told me I should have part, but I did not go for that, but merely because I was walking with the horses.
Mr. Watson. (To Mr. Pickford.) Q. What country is this in? - A. In the country of Middlesex.
Thompson. They have sworn very false against Gibbert, for he was asleep at the time.
Gibbert's defence. I know nothing about it, but am innocent; Thompson asked me to go and drink with him; I went, and we were coming down the town, when they took me along with him.
Gibbert called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

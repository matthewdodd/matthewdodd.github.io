            . I live at Chelsea


. On the morning of the day in the indictment, I was called by my servant at a little after five o'clock, and he told me that he thought there were thieves in the next house, which at that time was not inhabited. In consequence of that I got up, and caught the prisoner coming out with the copper in question on a porter's knot on his shoulders. He said, "he was sent for it by a man in the next street," and wanted to go, but I did not choose to let him. I gave him in charge of a constable. We saw where the copper had been taken from.
ANN - I am the servant of the last witness. On the morning in question, I saw two men go into the house next door, which was uninhabited, and as I suspected, I went and called my master.

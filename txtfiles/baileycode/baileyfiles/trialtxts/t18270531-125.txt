            . I am a husbandman, in Mr. Weekly's employ; I saw my young mistress fasten up the fowls about eight o'clock at night of the 11th of May, and next morning, about five o'clock, the patrol came; I found the boards wrenched down from the hen-house, and nine fowls, one chicken, and a quantity of eggs gone; he produced the fowls - I know them all, as I used to feed them.

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 12th of May I met the prisoner near the thirteenth milestone, with a sack on his shoulder, and a dung-fork; I said,"What have you got here?" I laid my hand on the bag, and said, "What have you got, fowls?" he said "Yes, I I bought them at Maidenhead - I have been walking all night, and am much fatigued;" I asked how many he had; he said seven or eight; he afterwards said he got them from Mr. Weekly's - I took him there.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

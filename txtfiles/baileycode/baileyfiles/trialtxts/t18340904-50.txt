HANNAH WINTER. I am the wife of Joseph Winter, of James-street, Globe-fields. On the 14th of July, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was in Spitalfieds market


 buying fruit - I had a purse in my pocket containing the money stated - I felt a hand in my pocket, and turned and saw the prisoner draw my purse from my pocket - I seized him by the collar, but he passed the purse to another person, who went off - the officer came and took the prisoner - the crowd was so great I could not take the other man.
Prisoner. Q. What distance was I from you when you took me? A. You were close to me.

            . The prosecutrix had the prisoner by the collar, and she gave him in custody to me - he said he came there for a pennyworth of onions - I said it was an odd time to come for them.

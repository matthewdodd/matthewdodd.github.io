CATHARINE TOLSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of January, 6 pairs of stockings, value 4s. 3d., the goods of 



William Stephen Dew and another; the said 



William Stephen Dew being her master.






WILLIAM STEPHEN DEW
. I am a hosier, and live in Cheapside. I am in partnership with my brother—the prisoner was my housemaid, and left on the 7th of February—on the 20th of February she was taken into custody—she had a duplicate in her hand, and was endeavouring to conceal it—I took it from her—it is for six pairs of stockings, pawned on the 26th of January, at Mr. Fleming's, Newgate-street—these are mine—they are of a particular make—I know the make of them—we miased ten dozen of them.





RODRICK FRASER
. I am shopman to Mr. Flemings, of Newgate-street. These six pairs of stockings were pawned at our shop on the 26th of January—I took them in, and gave this duplicate—it was a woman, but I do not know whether a young woman or an old one.

Prisoner. Q. Do not you know me by buying new articles at your shop? Witness. She has bought articles, but I do not know whether she pawned these.





HENRY BURRELL
. I went with Mr. Dew to search the prisoner's boxes—Mr. Dew got this duplicate from her hand—I found seven other duplicates in three or four different names.





JAMES COOK
. I am shopman to Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker. I produce

eight pairs of stockings pawned by an old woman at our shop on the 7th and the 11th of February.

MR. DEW. These are part of our property.

Prisoner's Defence. I was very unfortunate in my marriage, my husband deserted me—I had a little bag in which I kept some duplicates of my own, and when Mr. Dew came to me, I said I had no objection to his seeing my duplicates—I took them out of the bag, and this duplicate of my master's property came out first—it had been put in by some one unknown to me.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

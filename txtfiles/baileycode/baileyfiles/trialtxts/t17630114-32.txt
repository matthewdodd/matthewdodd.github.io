            . Last Saturday was se'nnight I was sitting in my back room, I perceived some coats fall from a shelf.
Q. Where do you live?
King. On Saffron-hill


 facing the globe. I went into the shop and missed a coat. I ran up Chick-lane, and just by Mr. Dolman's door met with the prisoner with the coat on his arm; I took him into custody. (The coat produced and deposed to) The prisoner said he had bought the coat. I had tried the coat on a customer the same day.
Q. Did you see any body in your shop when the coats fell?
King. No I did not.
Q. How near the door was this shelf?
King. About 2 or 3 yards.
Mr. Dolman. I was at my door, the prisoner was stopt there, and brought the prisoner in with this coat on his arm; he charged me with him, I being constable.
The Prisoner said nothing in his defence.
He called

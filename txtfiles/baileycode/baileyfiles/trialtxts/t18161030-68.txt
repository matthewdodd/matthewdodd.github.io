             was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 29th of October

             the property of 
               
                  
                     Henry

            . On the day in the indictment, the prisoner came to my shop, about half past nine in the morning, and offered a pair of stockings for sale; I would not buy them. In about twenty minutes, or half an hour afterwards, I was attending to my books, and hearing a noise on the threshold of the door, and looking round, I saw the prisoner reach in and snatch away the hat in question. I immediately pursued him, and he threw himself down in the middle of the road, and would not come back. I got an officer and took him into custody.

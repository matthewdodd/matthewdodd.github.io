             Hunter. On the 1st of June, early in the morning, I missed a blanket from a spare bed at our house in Wapping


; the prisoner had lodged there the night before, and was the only lodger there - he was gone on board of a ship; I took this blanket out of his clothes-bag, which he takes to sea with him - it was in another room.

             HUNTER. I told him of it; he said if I would forgive him he would never do the like again - I found the stairs muddy on the 6th of June, as I was going up; I found some other blankets in his bag.

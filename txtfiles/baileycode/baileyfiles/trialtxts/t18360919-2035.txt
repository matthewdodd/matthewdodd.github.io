HENRY DAVIS
. I am an engine-turner, and in Barnes-row, Coldbath-fields. On the 24th of August I was in Long Acre, with a lady, and thought I felt my coat-flap lifted up—I turned round immediately, and seized the prisoner—I saw him drop my handkerchief from his hand, I immediately took it up—I seized him, and took him to the station-house, and gave him into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I was going on an errand for my master, to see if a pair of shoes fitted—it was a big boy picked the gentleman's pocket, and threw it down—the gentleman turned round and laid hold of me. Witness. I saw his hands behind him, and saw it fall from him—I did not see any big boy there—nobody was near enough to take it but him, that I observed—he was within a yard of me at the time—I did not see it is his hand—I must have been if a big boy had thrown it down—I turned round instantly I felt it taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.*—


Transported for Seven Years.

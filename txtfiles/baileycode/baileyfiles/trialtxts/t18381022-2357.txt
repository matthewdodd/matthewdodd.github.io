RICHARD MASON
 and 




WILLIAM WILMOT
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
3rd of October, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



William Walter Baggaley, from his person.






WILLIAM WALTER BAGGALEY
. I live in Brett's-buildings, Hoxton, and am a clerk in the Post Office. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 3rd of October, I was in the City-road—I received information, and felt my handkerchief was gone—this is it—(looking at it)—I had had it a quarter of an hour before—I went after the two prisoners, with Carr—they were walking slowly along—I seized Wilmot—Mason ran away—he ran before I spoke to him.





GEORGE HENRT CARR
. I am a silversmith, and live in Finsbury-place. About a quarter past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 3rd of October, I was passing in the City-road, and saw the two prisoners—Mason took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he then went and joined the other—I went and told the prosecutor—we went after the two prisoners, and found them—Mason ran away—I followed him—he threw the handkerchief from him—I took it up, and took him.

Mason. I never had it at all—he had nearly throttled me, and I ran away—I was passing, and the gentleman said that he saw me make an attempt at the gentleman's pocket, then make another attempt, take the handkerchief, and put it into my breeches' pocket—he then crossed, and asked if the gentleman had lost a handkerchief, and he said he had; he said, "I think they are the two that have got it," and I had no handkerchief in my possession.

Witness. I saw him make an attempt at the prosecutor's pocket before

he took it—Wilmot was behind Mason when he tried the pocket, and when he took it.

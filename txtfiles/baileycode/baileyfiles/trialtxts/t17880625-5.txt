I live near Wilsdon Church

            , I pay a shilling a week for two rooms; I lost a cotton gown, and my daughter's gown, a coloured apron; my daughter's name is 
               
                  Ann
                   Sadler
               



            ; my gown was worth half a guinea; I lost them on Monday five weeks, I had left the house, and had been in the common field before I was informed of my loss; I went into the field about eight, I left my gown in the house; I do not remember seeing it then, it hung up in the room; I had it on on Sunday; this woman, Mrs. Kilby, was in the house when I went out, she went out afterwards, there was nobody in the house but us two; I locked the door of my own room myself after me.
Has the room that you rent an outer door? - My door comes into a field, and her door comes out into a lane, it is a cottage divided.
Is there any communication between your house and 
               
                  John
                   Kilby
               



            's appartment? - No.
You cannot go out of one into the other without coming into the field? - No; about an hour after I went out, while I was hoeing of beans, I heard the cry of stop thief, I went to my house, and the things were gone; I did not see the prisoner running, the place where the prisoner broke in, is the side of the house; the prisoner was taken directly to London to the justice, I came there that night, and saw the prisoner there.
Should you know him again, do you think? - Yes.
Look about and see if you see him? - (Looks about) That is the man, I never saw him before the robbery.
Had the cottage been originally built to be separate, or had there been any door blocked up? - I believe there had been a door between them, they were built originally separate from one another, that door was nailed up.

             sworn.
I went out in the morning to work, and came back immediately, and found the house was broke open, I went up stairs into my own room.

What house was broke open? - 
               
                  Mary
                   Sadler
               



            's, joining to mine; when I went up stairs, I thought I heard the man run down stairs, that was in my own house, I saw nobody; then I came down stairs and called for assistance, I went up a little field adjoining to the house, and saw the prisoner about two or three stones throw off, with the bundle in his right hand, and a stick in his left, he was walking.
Was he in a public road? - No, he was in a bye path.
But he was in a path? - Yes, he was pursued and taken by 
               
                  James
                   Irwine
               



            , I did not see him take him, I lost sight of him; he was carried to the justices, I saw the prisoner at the public-house after he was taken, I never saw him before.
From what you saw of the man that was in the adjoining field with the bundle, can you undertake to be sure that that was the same man that was brought back with the bundle to the public-house? - It certainly was; indeed the bundle was not opened at the public-house, a woman gave me the bundle.

             sworn.
I was binding hay at a rick just above the house, about four hundred yards from the place where the robbery was committed; Mrs. Kilby called me, and I immediately ran down to her, she said, she thought some body was in the house, I immediately got in at the hole that the man broke in at, I went up stairs and saw nobody there, there was no gowns there; she came in herself, and said the gowns were gone; we went up this little field facing Mrs. Sadler's house, and we traced a man up the grass very plain, the dew was on the grass, it was between nine and ten the 19th of May, to the best of my knowledge; we went out at the top of the little field, there is a road goes across the common field; I says to her, you look at this path, and I will stand here, she saw the prisoner going down the path; I immediately pursued after him as fast as I could, I made no halloo, nor no bellow after him; he crossed the field towards Wilsdon Church; he then came to a blind lane, he had no bundle in his hand then, when he crossed the lane on the other side over the stile; the bundle was missing, when he got over the other little field, the next but one to that, he made a bit of a halt, and looked to see, immediately I missed the bundle from his hand, I looked for it, he got across the next field to the lane, and made a bit of a halt, I still kept following him, crying out, stop thief! he found I still followed him; he mended his pace for a quarter of a mile, then he made a little bit of a halt again, then mended his pace again; three men besides me pursued him, and two of them almost met him, he kept running till he was taken; I never saw him before to my knowledge; I never was out of sight during the whole time I pursued him, only a little turning the corner, but these men saw him; I gave the bundle to a woman at a public house, to take care of till we had taken the man, as soon as the men took him, he 
               
                  drew
               


             this tuck out of the stick.
(The stick produced, being a sword in a common walking stick.)

                  drew
               


             this, I told him to stand back, the young men were close up to him, I saw him draw this tuck, we had nothing to defend ourselves, and I went and assisted the other man and took him; I saw him about ten minutes before I took him, he had run about 100 yards before I took him.

            . How long have you lived in the house? - I have lived in the house a twelve-month, I took it from week to week.
PRISONER'S DEFENCE.
I found the bundle in a narrow lane, about a hundred yards from the house, I picked it up, and walked along with it thinking no harm in the world, these men pursued me, I did not know what they were running after, I heard them cry out, stop thief! and as I picked up the bundle, I thought whether or no it might not be on that account, and I made my escape and dropt the bundle, and went away about my business thinking no harm, and they took me to a public house and brought me to the justice. As for the fire-arms, five weeks ago last Sunday, I was coming along about a mile and a hall beyond Edgware, in a very heavy thunder shower, and there was a barn unlocked, I went in for shelter, and there was a little straw and hay on the floor, I tumbled it about to lay down, and out-tumbled these arms, which I knew nothing about; I was surprized to see them, I put them in my pocket without thinking any harm in the world; I have no witness to prove these things, I expect people to my character every minute, one's name is Alsop, and the other Reave.

PHILIP VAN DE WALL
. I live in Chapel-street. Finshury-square. I was walking with the prosecutor—he suddenly withdrew his arm from me—I heard the word "Stop him "—I turned and saw the prisoner—I seized him by one of his handsm, and in the other hand I saw the handkerchief—it was a white handkerchief, with black marks—I believe it was the same that was picked up afterwards.

Prisoner I asked what he had got hold of me for—he said, "For taking a gentleman's handkerchief"—I said it was false—they stood there with me, and this gentleman came and brought the handkerchief.

on the ground—I picked it up—the prisone was near enough to him to take it—I did not see who took it.

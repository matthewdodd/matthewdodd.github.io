ROBERT WHITE. I am servant to Thomas Hall. a haberdasher
, of Bishopsgate-street


. On the 27th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked for a pair of black kid gloves - I was behind some calicoes in the window, and the moment the lad turned round to get the gloves, I saw the prisoner take a piece of ribbon off the counter, and put it into his bag - he did not offer to buy it; I came out, and secured him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was in the shop besides you? A. We have about five shopmen; it is a large shop - I believe he was the only customer; I never prosecuted any body before - I have not seen his father - I do not know what the other shopmen were doing- I am certain the ribbon did not drop off the counter; there is a bar to prevent that.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . The prisoner called on me and got these loaves for Stevenson, who is a customer of mine; I do not know that she came on the 18th of April - she came several times and got several loaves from time to time, and stated herself to be Stevenson's servant.
GEORGE STEVENSON. The prisoner had been one week charwoman
 to me in January last, but was not in my service in April - I never sent her to get these loaves.
Prisoner. I was in great distress, out of a situation, and would not turn into the street; I took the bread in her name - I throw myself on your mercy.

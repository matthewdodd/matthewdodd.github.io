            . I watched the prisoner and another man; I saw them go behind a house; they came back with a copper; I said, I think they have been stealing this copper. I told a man to step forwards to the watchhouse door. The other man was walking behind Whitfield; he ran away. Whitfield finding the other gone, he threw the copper down on my leg. A coachman stopped the prisoner. The prisoner was not out of my sight the whole time. The prisoner is the person that had the copper on his head. This is the copper.
Prosecutor. This copper was in my washhouse. It is my house. Mrs. Nichols lives with me. It was stolen at the same time the other things were.

Prisoner's Defence. In the Hampstead-road, this man asked me to carry this copper. I had a shilling for carrying it to St. Giles's.

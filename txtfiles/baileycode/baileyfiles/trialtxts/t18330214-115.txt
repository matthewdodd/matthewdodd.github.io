             (Police-constable K 130.) On the 23rd of January I fell in with the prisoner in Brook-street - I asked him what he had got under his arm; he said a pair of boots, which he had bought in Brook-street, and he put them into my hand - I said he must go and show me where he had bought them; he then ran off - I pursued, and took him; I inquired, and found the prosecutor.

ELLEN THOMPSON, alias
 Cook,

 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of September, 1 basin, value 1s.; 1 towel, value 6d.; and 1 apron, value 6d.; the goods of 



William Tarran.






MARY TARRAN
. I am the wife of William Tarran—we live on the second floor at No. 6, Exeter-street. I had a towel, basin, and apron on the balustrades on the 11th of September—I went out at one o'clock, and missed them when I came home at half-past nine—the towel is marked, and it is mine—I can swear to this apron—(examining the articles.)

Prisoner. The apron is mine, and I can prove it—I know it by a darn in the front with white cotton. Witness. I know it is mine—it is old, and I have darned it myself.





GEORGE HEALEY
 (police-constable D 42.) I was on duty in Lissongrove, and was fetched to the prosecutor's lodging—the landlord gave the prisoner in charge for stealing the basin—the prisoner has this towel in her hand, and was using it as a pocket handkerchief, and this apron was on her arm—I took her to the station-house—she said she was going to wash herself in the back-yard with the basin.

Prisoner's Defence. The basin was not in my possession, the officer sent a man up stairs for it; the towel I know nothing of. The officer has taken a false oath, it was not found on me.




GUILTY
.** Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

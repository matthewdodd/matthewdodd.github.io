                  , from his person

MICHAEL AMBROSIA. I am an Italian. I was in King-street, St. Giles'


, at half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 6th of November; I felt my pocket handkerchief go from my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner run: I caught him with it - this is it.

            . I am an officer. I did not see the handkerchief taken.

            . I was in St. Giles', and saw the prisoner and another boy; the prosecutor came along, and the prisoner's companion spoke to him, as if he was asking the price of his images, while the prisoner took the handkerchief, and ran away. I told my father of it: the prosecutor caught the prisoner, and gave him to my father.

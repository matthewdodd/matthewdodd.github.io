            . I am a lighterman, and live at Horsleydown; I was taking some casks of plumbs from Ralph's kay


, on the 22d of December: I saw the prisoner and a sailor take a cask of raisins. I went and found the cask about 5 or 6 yards from the rest; the sailor ran away, I took the prisoner; he attempted to kick my heels up, and said G - d blast you, and blow your eyes out: he said he knew nothing of the raisins; but I saw him have hold of them: bringing him to the Mansion house he took out his knife with intent either to cut my hand, or his own throat, and said he would lick me for using him ill.
Prisoner's defence.
I came across the water, and stopped to make water; the men charged me with taking the plumbs, but I know nothing of the matter.
Q. to Pearce. Did you see the plumbs in the possession of the prisoner?
Pearce. I saw him and the sailor lift them from the ground.

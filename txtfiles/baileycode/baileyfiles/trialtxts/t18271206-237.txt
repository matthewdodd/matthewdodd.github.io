SAMUEL THOMAS DAVIS. I am a coachmaster
. On the 9th of December I was at Charing cross


, with my stage, which goes to Blackheath - my great coat was on the box; I saw the prisoner by the side of it; I watched him, and saw him go away with the coat on his arm - I followed and took him with it; it was about a quarter to ten o'clock at night.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. Q. Did you see a man give it to me? A. No - nobody else was near the coach; he was rolling it up, and said he had picked it up.

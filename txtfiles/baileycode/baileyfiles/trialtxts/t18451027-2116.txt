2116. 




JAMES ROBINSON
 and 




ROBERT NEWMAN
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 shawl, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



John Cook; and that Newman had been before convicted of felony.






FRANCES COOK
. I am the wife of John Cook—he keep a cottage in Frenchman's Island, Caledonian-fields, Islington—my shawi was in my garden, drying—I missed it on the 20th of Oct—this is it.





REST STRONACH
. I had three men at work on Monday, the 20th Oct, about three o'clock—I saw the two prisoners—I saw them go along ami watch the man's cottage—presently I saw them jump up the bank and go away—I went to Cook—the prosecutrix missed her shawl and

my shift—I and my brother then ran after the prisoners—Newman got off, but Robinson was caught by a man who delivered him to me and another—as we could not find an officer we took him towards the canal-bridge—he jumped clean over the canal, a distance of nearly fifteen yards, and got off, and we very nearly got well lathered by a parcel of fellows who wanted to rescue him.





JAMES EVANS
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" about three o'clock—my cottage is directly opposite Cook's—I ran out and looked all ways—I could see no one—there is a back path which Cook's garden prevented the sight of—I conjectured they must have gone that way—I ran on, and saw the two prisoners, and Stronach and his brother running as hard as they could—I picked up this shawl on my return, lying in a ditch—the prisoners had passed that spot exactly.





FRANCIS MANSER
 (police-constable S 87.) I produce a certificate of Newman's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 28th Jan., 1845, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person—he was a regular associate of thieves—after he got out of prison he went to work about two months, and since that he has got to his old companions again.

ROBINSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 17.—



Confined Six Months.


 NEWMAN—

WILLIAM WOOD
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 pair of scales, value 4s., the goods of 



John Jones; and 1 coat, 1l.; the goods of 



Mary Jones; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARY JONES
. The prisoner used to come to my house while I was at Bow—I had a pair of scales belonging to my son John and a coat—he is twenty-five years old—I had a coat belonging to my husband, who is now dead—I missed all these things, on the 9th of Dec.—the scales now produced are my son's—he made them himself—I have not found the coat.


Prisoner. She said another lodger stole the scales. Witness. I did not suspect any one else—the prisoner lodged with me at Bow.





JOHN CATTEN
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Stratford. These scales were pledged at my shop on the 10th of Dec., in the name of John Wood by the prisoner—I am quite sure of him—I knew him.

Prisoner. It is false; I never pledged them. Witness. Yes, you did.





JOHN WILLIAM MANNING
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate from this Court, of the prisoner's former conviction—(read Convicted on the 7th of April, 1845, of burglary, and confined six months)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

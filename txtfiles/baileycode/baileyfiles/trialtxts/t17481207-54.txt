            . I am an Irish factor
; I live in Milkstreet


. On the 15th of Nov. last I lost four pieces of linen, about 100 yards. These three women came into my warehouse, and brought one 
               
                  Solomon 
                  Levi 
               



            , a Jew, with them for their interpreter. They asked me by their interpreter if I had any linen, they told me they did not understand one word of English. They asked me for Irish linen cloth, from two shillings a yard to five. I told the interpreter to tell the women I could serve them. I accordingly brought down a good deal of linen. I had occasion to send my clerk out of the warehouse just upon their coming in; then there remained none but my porter and myself. They took an opportunity (while I was reaching the linen from the farther end of the warehouse, as it is very long, I was a considerable distance from where they were looking at the linen) to send the porter to a grocer's for a sample of coffee, so that they had one part of the warehouse to themselves. The grocer came over with the coffee to them, but they told him they would come the next day, and make a bargain with me for the linen, and him for the coffee. Then I apprehend they had taken my four pieces of linen.
Q. How do you know they took it?
Clark. I had that very morning sold some linen out to a draper, the person that carried them returned and told me there was one piece wanting and when I had carefully looked over the pile there were three more missing. I did not suspect them any more. But I was surprized the next day to see them come again in a coach to my door. I had a gentleman at breakfast with me, to whom I was just telling the case; and I desired him to assist me in shewing a good deal of linen on the board, to give them an opportunity &c. to take what they pleased. I laid perhaps an 100 or 200 pieces on the shop board. Mr. Heavingham, the gentleman that was with me, and my clerk, was at a distance. There were four pieces gone the 15th, and these three pieces they had got (which were produced in court) the 16th. But I am trying them for the fact on the 15. When I thought they had got each a load, I ordered them to the farther end of the shop. 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Christian 
               



             took one piece she had concealed and lays it down; another drops another piece down from under her petticoats; the third had hers about her for near three quarters of an hour. I then taxed them with taking the four pieces the day before. They ordered the Jew to tell me they were willing to leave me the value of those pieces until I found them, if I would let them go. I charged a constable with them, and carried them before my Lord Mayor. When we searched them they had six or seven petticoats, each had five or six pockets in every petticoat.

                  Levi 
               



            . I left my place by the persuasion of the husband of one of these women. He told me they were merchants, and I should be their interpreter, they said they bought goods, and if they found an opportunity they would steal. I went with them the next day to Mr. Clark's; they desired me to tell Mr. Clark they wanted to buy a large quantity of cloth. So he shewed them some: then they sent out Mr. Clark's man for some coffee, and when he was gone they took an opportunity to take four pieces of cloth, it was Irish cloth. I saw all the pieces taken out of their pockets the same evening. Three of them the husband to 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Christian 
               



             bought of them. He gave them between eight and nine guineas for them and some stockings: the fourth piece they cut in pieces to make shirts of. After that the women told me they would go to Mr. Clark's the next day. I desired them not to go there; I said we should be found out; they said four pieces would not be missed among so large a quantity. They gave me two guineas: so we went next day in a coach; and when we came to Mr. Clark's they wanted to see the same cloth they saw the day before. There was a gentleman there, so they took me into a back room to make a bill. And when Mr. Clark was writing a bill, I heard the other gentleman begin to make a noise; he said, take out that piece of cloth you have under your petticoat. And they were all brought into the same room.
Q. You talked with them in your own language, what was it you said?
Levi. I said in Dutch, did not I tell you, you had better to have let me kept my place, than to go to steal things. They gave me for answer, I need not be afraid, because I was only interpreter. Mr. Clark wanted to have his cloth again; they bid me say they knew nothing of it, for they said, if you tell we shall all be hanged; this they all three said. They bid me tell Mr. Clark they would lay down as much money as the value of the four pieces of linen was worth, until he should find the linen again; then he should pay them the money back again.
Mr. Heavingham. Mr. Clark told me the 16th of Nov. that the 15th he lost four pieces of linen, and that the people, which had been looking at some linen the day before, and that he had some reason to suspect, told him they would come again as that day. Presently they came in a coach to the door with this Jew about 10 o'clock in the forenoon. Mr. Clark and I shewed them several pieces of linen; and after they had been in the warehouse half an hour, or three quarters, I thought they were making motions to go; and I desired Mr. Clark to take them into the compting house to give them an account of the linen in writing, that they might the better know the prices of them. And, as he was taking them in, 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Christian 
               



             took a piece from under her petticoats, and laid it on a pile. I suppose they imagined we were going to search them; 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Mildred 
               



             was next her, she took a piece from under her petticoat, immediately after which I took it out of her hand; then we conducted them into the compting-house, and in about 15 or 20 minutes after 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Raductin 
               



             dropped a piece by the side of her after the constable came in. The three pieces were produced in court, and each swore separately to.

            . I am book-keeper to Mr. Clark. The three women, with Levi, came to Mr. Clark's warehouse on the 15th of Nov. He, in their names, desired to see some quantities of Irish linen from 2 to 5 s. a yard, and I saw them there the next day; and upon oath declare the three pieces to be Mr. Clark's property, and that I saw Raductin drop one of them down from under her petticoats.




               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.

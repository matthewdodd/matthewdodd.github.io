John Heap.






ROSA HEAP
 I am the wife of John Heap, and live in Montagu-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner came to me on the 9th of August, and said he knew where to sell a set of brushes, if we would let somebody go with him—my husband told him I should go with him—I went with him as far as Dunn-street—he went up a step, came down, and said the woman was not at home, but if I went with him to his brother's, he could sell them—he went up a court in Fashion-street, and left me standing outside for an hour—he went through a public-house, and never returned—I afterwards found him in Petticoat-lane, and he said somebody had stolen them from him.





EDWARD SPALL
. I am a policeman. I took him in charge—he said somebody had stolen the brushes, and ran away with them.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in Petticoat-lane the day before, and had some old brushes to sell; a man asked me to get him a new set; I said perhaps I could. The prosecutor had told me if I wanted any he could supply them. I went, and the young woman went with me. I met a young woman I owed some money to; she took them out of my hand, and ran away.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

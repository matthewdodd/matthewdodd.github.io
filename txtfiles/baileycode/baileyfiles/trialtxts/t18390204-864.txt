THOMAS PEYTON BANBURY
. I am a clerk to a solicitor. On the 25th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was near the Town Hall, in High-street, Borough—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner pulling my handkerchief from my pocket, and putting it down by his right side—I collared him and asked him for my handkerchief—he said he had not got it—he dropped it, and pulled me from one side of the street to the other—he struck at me and fined to get away, but I never let him go—the officer came and took him.

Prisoner. When you turned the handkerchief was on the ground, and you asked a gentleman if he saw me take it—he said be did not. Witness. I saw the handkerchief in your hand—there was a gentleman who saw me struggling with the prisoner, and he said, "Hold on to him, young man," and when the prisoner was taken, I said to the gentleman, "Did you see him take it?"—he said, "No, I did not"—the prisoner stuck his nails into my hand.





JAMES GIRLING
 (police-constable M 112.) I saw the prosecutor struggling with the prisoner—the prosecutor's hand was bleeding—I took the prisoner, and a young woman took up the handkerchief.




GUILTY

JAMES WATSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of Feb., 1 pair of shoes, value 10s.; the goods of 



Justus Wangemann: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JUSTUS WANGEMANN
. I am a baker, and live at No. 3, Colt-lane, Cambridge-road, Bethnal-green. These shoes were in my bakehouse about ten o'clock in the morning, on the 9th of Feb.—I saw them again at the pawnbroker's the next afternoon—these are them—the prisoner baked pies at my place three or four times.





WILLIAM BLANNAN
. I am shopman to Mr. Ashley, a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned these shoes about seven o'clock, on the 9th of Feb., for 3s.





CHARLES PATTEN
 (police-constable K 206.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

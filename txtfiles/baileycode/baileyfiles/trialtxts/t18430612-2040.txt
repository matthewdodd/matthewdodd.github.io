2040. 




CAROLINE HOPKINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of April, 1 shift, value 1s., the goods of 



Esau Case, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZA CASE
. I am the wife of Esau Case. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house to do needle-work—I missed a shift from a box, on the 6th of April, while she was there—this is it—I have no mark on it, but the sleeves are twice hemmed round, and new sewn, which is rather unusual—it is my own work.





HARRIET MOLES
. I am searcher at the station, at Clapham. I found this shift on the prisoner's person—she said she cared not what became of her.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had taken the shift off the floor of the room, and not from the box; that when she heard she was suspected, she destroyed it, and the one produced and claimed by the prosecutrix was her own.)

MRS. CASE. I swear this is my shift.





GEORGE COLLINS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

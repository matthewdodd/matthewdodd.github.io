Alexandar Linton. I was foreman to Mr. 
               
                  Thomas
                   Langley
               



            , a master builder
, who was employed in American-square in the Minories


; he is since dead; I saw the timber in question lying among the other materials.

            . I am a watchman. As I was coming up the Minories I met the prisoner coming from America square with two sir planks upon his shoulder; I seized him; he attempted to get away, and behaved so ill I was obliged to handcuff him. Mr. Leniton came to the watch-house and saw the prisoner.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

            . I am a labourer in the service of the London Dock Company; the prisoner was at work in the same warehouse with me. There was a great deal of ivory there. I saw him take an elephant's tooth out of the window, and put it under his jacket. I had seen him take it before that, and throw it from one end of the warehouse to the other, and said it would make a nice fid. After that I returned from lunch, saw him take it from the window, put it under his overalls, and go out of the warehouse, towards the privy. Barton afterwards gave me information - I went to a pile of wood near the privy, and found that tooth, with three others, in the pile of wood,

            . I am a labourer at the London Docks. George informed me. I followed the prisoner as far as the privy door, he was in the act of stooping, and shook his trowsers - he saw me - I went in, and remained about two minutes. I left him there.

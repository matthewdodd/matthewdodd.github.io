THOMAS WHITE
 was indicted

 for stealing 16 spoons, value 8l. 10s.; 1 knife, 5s.; and 1 pair of sugar-tongs, 10s.; the goods of 



Henry John Stafford.






PAMELA ELIZA STAFFORD
. I am the wife of Henry John Stafford; we live in Cumming-street, Pentonville. On the 15th of Sept. the prisoner came between eleven and twelve o'clock, and desired to see my husband on business—my husband was then out of town—the prisoner left a paper, which he desired me to inclose if I was going to write to him—I told him I would—I left him in the room for five or ten minutes—next morning he came again, and brought a letter, which I told him I could not convey to my husband—he said it was of great importance, and he would call at the end of the week—on the 18th I missed sixteen spoons, one desert-knife, and my sugar-tongs—these are them.





ARTHUR HOLGATE
. I am in the employ of Mr. Atterborough, a pawn-broker, in Fleet-street. I produce these eight spoons and other things—I took them in of the prisoner on the 15th and 16th of Sept.





FRANCIS CLARK PERRY
. I am in the employ of Mr. Harman, a pawn-broker in the Strand. I produce six spoons and two table-spoons, which I took in, but I cannot say of whom.





CHARLES LANE
 (police-constable F 109.) I produce the duplicates of these things, which I got from Mr. Lang.





THOMAS HENNY LANG
. I was coming up Holborn on the 26th of Oct.—I met a friend who had lost some bagatelle balls—I went with him to where he had got the prisoner in custody, and the prisoner gave these duplicates to me.




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

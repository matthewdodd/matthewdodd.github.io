            . On Friday the 11th of September, I was at Billingsgate-market



; about a quarter after four o'clock, I heard there were two pickpockets taken; I saw them brought out of a public-house to the watch house; upon hearing there were many handkerchiefs found upon them, I felt in my pocket for mine, and found it was gone; I had made use of it but about a quarter of an hour before; I went to the watch-house, and asked to see the handkerchiefs; I found mine was on the outside, in which all the rest were tied.

             the younger. I was sitting at the end of a form at Billingsgate-market, the two prisoners came to a form opposite to me; one stood and jostled Mr. Simonds a fishmonger, while the other had his hand in his pocket; I got up and took him by the collar, and said, you rogue, you had your hand in the man's pocket; he took nothing out.

            . I was drinking a gill of wine and water, in a public house, when the two prisoners were brought in together; upon searching them, Brian had all the handkerchiefs in his breeches about ten of them, that which the prosecutor owned was one of them.
Brian's defence.
I was going to Billingsgate, I found all the handkerchiefs in a bundle; I put them in my breeches having no pockets; I am a sailor.
Clark's defence.
I was going to Billingsgate to go to Gravesend, to a West-India man; I paid for my passage; I went and got a pint of purl; then that gentleman said he saw my hand in a gentleman's pocket; that gentleman lost nothing.

             the elder. I was at Billingsgate



 on the 11th of September; I went to wipe my hands and I missed an old handkerchief; about half an hour after I went to feel in my pocket again, and my rule was gone; my son having seen the two prisoners, one of them had his hand in a person's pocket, they were secured and taken to the George-alehouse; I went and saw a parcel of handkerchiefs taken from Brian, and my rule also; and it was delivered to me; my handkerchief was among the rest; I know nothing against Clark.

Mr. Turner. I saw the handkerchief and rule found on Brian.
Brian's defence as before.
Clark's defence.
I know no more of what I am charged with than a child unborn.

             sworn. - I live at No. 173, Fleet-street


, I am a silk-mercer
; between the hours of five and six o'clock, after it was dark, on the 7th of December
, I heard a voice at the door, saying, that somebody should come out and protect the windows; I went out as fast as I could, I saw the prisoner at the bar was laid hold of by Mr. March, the elder.
Q. What had he done to your house? - A. The pane of glass was broke, and one part of the silk was out of the window; and the other part was in the hole of the window; it was cut about the middle, but not quite separated.
Q. Are you sure the glass was whole before? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you hear it break? - A. I did not hear the window break, I heard the noise at the door, it was quite dark, we had a lamp in the window; I never saw the boy before to my knowledge.

            , Jun. sworn. - Q. Do you live in this street? - A. Yes, about twenty doors from Mr. Francis, the same side of the way; I was coming towards my father's, and I saw the prisoner at the window; I went and told my father that I thought he was going to cut the window, and me and my father went out together; we passed him, he was standing at the window; then we returned back again, and passed him the secondtime; I then turned round, and saw he was pulling something out of the window; my father then went and laid hold of him; he dropped the silk, which I laid hold of, and held it there till Mr. Francis came out.
Court. Q. It was not all out? - A. No, about four yards of it was out.
Q. You did not see whether it was broke when you first went by it? - A. I did not.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MARCH
               



            , Sen. sworn. - I went out as my son has stated to you, and took the lad into custody, with part of this silk in his hand, which he dropped on the ground when I laid hold of him.
Q.(To Francis.) How near was this roll of silk in the window to the pane of glass that was broke? - A. About the length of this roll.
Q. Whether, by accident of falling, this roll of silk might have broken the glass? - A. It could not have been broke by its falling, and one part of the silk was inside, and the other out, when he was taken; I do not think it could have fell there without a hand being put in.

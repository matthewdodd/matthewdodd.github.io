                  Hudson 
               



            . About two o'clock in the morning, on the 20th of December, as I was getting up, I saw one of the prisoners upon the leads on the Fleet-market-house


 ; I heard a pane of glass break; I called to the watchman, and told him there were thieves; the watchman lent me his staff, and 
               
                  William 
                  Cooke 
               



             and I got up upon the leads; we both tumbled over some lead that lay there unrip'd rolled up; at the farther end I saw the prisoner Cook; I hit him a knock and he tumbled off the market-house. Patten lay, after the other was down, near where the other did; I hit him, then Cooke laid hold on him.

                  Crook 
               



            . I rent this market-house of the city by lease for 21 years from Midsummer last, there are 36 different shops, the tenants have no interest in it.


                  William 
                  Cooke 
               



            . I was talking to the watchman at the corner of Harp-alley, about two o'clock this morning, the former witness called out watch; I got up upon the market-house along with him; he tumbled over the lead first, and I upon him; we went from one end of the market-house to the other; after that the lanthorn was handed up to me; when we came over-against the Wheat-sheaf, 
               
                  William 
                  Hudson 
               



             espied Cook out, and with the staff knocked him off the market-house. I seized the other and we handed him down; then I took the lead, it was doubled up, and after that I found a knife and an old chisel there.


                  Edward 
                  Slade 
               



            . I am a watchman. About two in the morning we were talking about thieves in the market; saying, I wondered we could never hear them. I heard the word, there were thieves there then. Then Hudson and Cooke both got up, and I gave Hudson my staff; just by the dial they met with the two prisoners, one they knocked down, the other they handed down; I took care of them: they would not tell the constable who they were, or where they were going to. The next day they were brought to Guild-hall, then they formed a story, that they got up for a hat.
Cooke's Defence.
Patten took my hat and cap from off my head, and threw it on the Fleet-market-house ; I found my cap, but could not find my hat; then there was a butcher's boy called out, there was somebody on the market-house.
Patten's Defence.
I happened to throw his hat and cap up; then he threw mine up; said I, will not you be so good as to get up and fetch it? and I gave him a hoist up ; then I asked him, if he would not throw it down? Said he, no, you shall get up for yours, as well as I for mine. We did not know what to do with the lead if we had got it.
To Cook's character.

            . I have known 
               
                  John 
                  Cook 
               



             about nine years. I never heard any harm of him in my life; he has lived with me six or seven years. I have trusted him with a pretty deal of value. I have sent him out with a load of cheese, and other things; I have sent him with other persons, when I did not care to trust them. I would now trust him as soon as any body I know.

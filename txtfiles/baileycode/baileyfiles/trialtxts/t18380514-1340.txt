JOHN WHITE
. I keep a coal-shed The prisoner was my errand-boy—on the 21st of April I sent him with half a hundred weight of coals to a customer in Craven-buildings, City-road—he was to bring back 10d. for them—he returned, and told me the person who had the coals wanted change for half a crown—I gave him 1s. 8d., and he was to bring back the half-crown; but he never returned, and I saw no more of him till he was in custody—this was the first day he was in my employ, and the first money he had to receive.





EMMA RIDOUT
. I live in Craven-buildings, City-road. The prisoner brought me tenpenny-worth of coals—I told him to get change for half a crown—he brought me back 1s. 8d., and I gave him a half-crown—I am sure he is the same boy.

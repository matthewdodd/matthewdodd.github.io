conducted the Prosecution.






HENRY MEECHAM
 I am a carpenter, of 257, High-street, Borough. On 25th March I lived at Trafalgar-street, Walworth, St. Mary, Newington—I occupied the house—about two o'clock that day I went out, leaving no one in the house—the door was shut, but not locked—I returned a little after ten, and missed a white great coat, trowsers, and other things—these things are all mine (produced), and were safe when I left.





ELIZABETH THORPE
 On 25th March I was at my brother's, a few doors from Mr. Meecham's—about seven o'clock, Johnston knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Skinner, a carpenter, lived there—I said, "No"—he said he had come from the City with a load, and had been in the street three-quarters of an hour, and could not find him; he went away.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No; this was on Sunday—I saw him that day week at the station—I am sure of him; the lamps were lighted.





WILLIAM JEPSON
 I took the prisoner on another charge I went to Hat-field-street, where Johnston said he lived, and found twenty-five duplicates, most of them relating to this property.





THOMAS BARROW
 I am a shoemaker, of Hatfleld-street—Johnston took a room of me on 11th March, and left on 14th April—Elliott used to come to and fro—he slept there one night; it was the room Jepson searched.





SELINA FISHER
 I am the wife of Charles Fisher, of 37, Hatfleld-street, the next room to Johnston—on 25th March, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went into the room, and saw Elliott wearing a white great-coat.

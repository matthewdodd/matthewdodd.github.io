JAMES BROOKS
. I am a butcher, and lodge in Grafton-street, I went to the Commercial-road, on the 8th of January—I went to the Registry pay office, and received a £5 note, one sovereign, half a sovereign, and 5s. 6d. on silver—I left there about half-past two o'clock—the

prisoner had gone with me to this place—I knew him before at Portsmouth—he used to live next door to where I worked—I met him that day as I was going down to the Registry-office—we went into a public-house—I think it was the Black Horse—I was quite sober when we went in—we had a put of half-and-half, and sat some time—he then asked me to go out and have a game at skittles, which I did—then we had a quartern of gin, and then had another game of skittles, and played till it was dark—we then went to the King's Arms—had some gin and water, and sat there till about a quarter past seven o'clock—I do not know what I did after that for I got drunk—I did not know any thing till about twelve o'clock, when I was taken down to the station-house, and in the morning I found I had no money—I paid 18as. out of the money I had received, and had 2s. out of the sovereign, and I had 2s. 6d. or 3s. of my own money in my pocket, beside what I received—I had about 6l. in all—I had paid 18s. for a tailor's bill—we were playing at skittles all the afternoon—I did not spend above 4s. or 5s.—I had about 5l. 18s. when to the King's Arms—I should know the bill I paid, but could not swear to the bank-note—they were all together in my jacket pocket.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. At what time in the morning did you meet the prisoner? A. About eleven o'clock—I met him by accident—he had come up to see if he could get into any business in London—I believe he told me so—we played several games of skittles, and I said "It is no use playing we will go and have a drop of something short"—I had not the money then, it was after the first drinking that I received the money, and I put it into my pocket, with a receipt which I got from the slop-seller—I put it all in my pocket together, in one parcel—they might have got separated in my pocket—I received the money about half-past two o'clock—then went to the Black Horse, and then to the King's Arms—I played at skittles before I received my money, and we went and played a second time, till about a quarter, or half-past six o'clock—we then went to the house, and sat there till about half-past seven o'clock—after that I cannot tell what took place—the prisoner did not urge me to come away, that I know of—I never gave the money to any one—he was an old friend—I should not have objected for him to have taken it out to take care of.





GEORGE BAKER
. I am an undertaker, and live in Salmon-lane, Lime house, I was at the King's Arms on the 8th of January, from seven to eight o'clock—I saw the prosecutor in the parlour intoxicated—the prisoner was there when I went into the parlour—the prosecutor had been exhibiting his back, and said something about flogging—I sat down, and had a glass of half-and-half—the landlord found that the prosecutor was in that state that he did not like him to he in the parlour—he was called on to pay his reckoning. and had no money—the landlord threatened that be would not let the prisoner quit the house till he was searched—he attempted to leave, and refused to be searched—I stopped him as I was at the bar two policeman then arrived—he had struck me on the side of the head with his fist—I cannot say whether it was clenched or not—then a party coming by called in to have half a pint of porter, and seeing me ill-used, forced the prisoner into the tap-room—he went into a corner, and seated himself in the further box, where he took out of his pocket, some pieces of paper, one of which was 65 note—I saw the word "five" written on the note, but I could not see the number he then tried to destroy a paper. and was stopped by Mr. Robey at the tire-place.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you there when Mr. Robey was in the room?


A. No; it must have been from seven to eight o'clock when this occurred—I was there more than an hour—I went there about five or six o'clock—I was not drinking from five to eight o'clock—I went with a friend of mine—I did not see this person come in—I was not always in the same room—I was in the tap-room, and was going to the bar to have a glass of half-and-half—the parlour door was open, and the sailor was standing there—I had been sitting in the tap-room—the prisoner came in afterwards, and the landlord said he had his suspicions—Mr. Robey was not in the parlour at that time—there was a gentleman there whom I did not know—I do not recollect the prosecutor going out and leaving the prisoner behind—I cannot say that the prisoner was sober—I drank nothing with the sailor—I drank with him afterwards, when we left the police-office in company with the policeman, but not at his expense—I had a slate—I did not write any thing on it—the sailor said he had been smuggling—he had some tobacco or something, and I said he had better be careful—I sat in the parlour, I think about half an hour—I know Mr. Robey merely as an occasional man in my trade—I did not drink with him—no one else was present—I wrote nothing about smuggling on the slate.

Q. On the next day, when it seems you, the two policeman and the sailor were drinking together, had you any conversation about this transaction? A. Certainly; it was the business at the police-office, and when we were drinking at the public-house it might have been mentioned—we did not agree what to say—I paid my share for what I had—I paid 1s.—I do not know whether I drank a shilling's worth—I do not remember any thing being said about the evidence that was to be given to-day—I will not swear it was not mentioned—I said nothing against him—the sailor said he did not want to hurt the young man, he only wanted the money—I am compelled undoubtedly to drink with strangers—when the prosecutor was at the bar he was arm-in-arm with the prisoner—I do not recollect that he had hold of the prisoner—I cannot swear he had not.

COURT. Q. Do you swear that when you attempted to stop his leaving the house that then struck you? A. He did; an I swear that I saw him take some pieces of paper out of his pocket, and one was marked "Five," and he attempted to destroy a paper that was in the same hand with the £5 note—I consider it was that he wanted to destroy with the others.

MR. DOANE. Q. You say he tried to destroy them? A. He threw them into the fire-place, which joined the box not further off than I am from you—he came right up to the fire-place and threw it in—there was a fire there, to the best of my recollection, and he was standing close to it—I cannot swear that any body had hold of him at the time—there was a paper torn up, but what paper I do not know, it was neither of the papers produced—I do not know that the bank-note was not torn—I have not had it in my hand.

COURT. Q. I understand that struck you? A. He did; and then he was forced into the tap-room—he then took some piece of paper out of his pocket—I saw the word "Five" on one—he then went up to the fireplace, and finding I watched him, he tried to strike me—he then threw something into the fire-place.





JOHN ROBEY
, I am an undertaker. I was in the King's-arms on the evening of the 8th of January—I saw the prisoner at the bar when I went in—I saw him ill-using Mr. Baker, striking him, and attempting to force his way out—I put the prisoner back into the tap-room—he ran to the

last box in the tap-room, and took two pieces of paper out of his right-hand trowser's-pocket—one he tore up, which he supposed was the £5 note—he went up to the fire-place, and put the pieces of paper into the fire, where they were burnt—he was searched afterwards in my presence, and the £5 note and other things were found on him—I saw the word "Five" on it—he was charged with the robbery, and pulled some money out of his pocket, which he wanted to hand over to the landlord of the King's-arms, if he would let him go out—he said that was all he had belonging to the prosecutor, and he would give him that if he would let him leave.

Cross-examined. Q. Must the last witness have heard that? A. He must have heard it—I swear that the prisoner said, after he produced the silver, that he would give it up to the landlord, if he would let him leave the house—I do not know whether the landlord had asked for his reckoning—I was not in the house when the prosecutor was called on to pay his reckoning—I went in at half-past seven o'clock, and the landlord was in the bar—he could not leave the bar, so many persons were coming in—he had sent for a policeman—the prosecutor was in the tap-room when I went in, asking the prisoner for his money—he was standing—I did not see him arm-in-arm with the prosecutor, I was not there when he came out—I went in accidentally, just as the scuffle had commenced—when the prisoner produced the silver, the note was in his pocket—he had pulled out two pieces of paper and the note, and destroyed one paper—two policemen were called in—I did not know those policemen—I knew the other, the undertaker—I know the landlord, but am not acquainted with him—I met the policeman again at the Thames police-office—I did not go to any public-house—the sailor did not ask me to drink that evening—I did not drink with him—I had no conversation with him after this man was taken—I left directly and went home—the prisoner was not very drunk—the prosecutor was not drunk.

COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that the sailor was not drunk that evening? A. He was not then, he had been, and got sober again—that was at half-past seven o'clock—I did not see the sailor again.





ERASMUS CHARLTON
 (police-sergeant K 1.) I was called in, there was a charge of the prisoner having robbed a sailor—I asked him what he had got belonging to the sailor? he said, "Nothing"—I said he must be searched, he said he would not be searched—I took hold of him, and he struggled violently—I told the constable, No. 253, to take hold of one hand and a stranger who was there to take hold of the other, while I searched him—he still resisted—I found a £5 note in his left-hand pocket, wrapped up in a hosier's bill—this is the bill and note—somebody else said he had other money about him belonging to the sailor—he said, "No, that is all I have belonging to the sailor"—I searched him further, and found some silver.

Cross-examined. Q. He made great objection to be searched at first? A. Yes—I was present the greater part of the time when this took place—if he had said any thing. I must have heard it he had been drinking, but was not drunk—he was sensible of what he was doing and saying—my opinion is, that the sailor was drunk—I had a constable with me—I was before the Justice the next day—I never saw Mr. Baker till the night the prisoner was given into custody—I saw him the next day at the Thames police—we were there three or four hours, I should think—I came away with Baker, Robey, and the sailor—I went into the Commercial-road, to serve a summons on Mr. Dewdney—I went nowhere else

with him—I was not at any public-house with the two undertakers that day, nor with the other constable—I remember a handkerchief being taken from the prisoner's pocket the night before—there was only me and another policeman, who took the prisoner into custody—I am sure the two undertakers went with me to Mr. Dewdney's.





GEORGE BAKER
 re-examined. Q. Is this one of the policemen, who was at the public-house? A. I think he was one of the two I was speaking of.





ERASMUS CHARLTON
 re-examined My duty was at the Thames Police Office that day, and if there was a case before the Magistrate, it was my duty to go to the public-house to see if any officers were there; but I did not drink with any body, I defy and body to say I did—six shillings and three sixpences were found on the prisoner.





GEORGE BAKER
. The drink might have been passed to him, but I do not know—there were a great many policemen—I believe I was there with two policeman, and Robey was there.





WILLIAM LAFFORD BORBITT
 (police-constable K 253.) I was present when the prisoner was searched, and the note taken from him—I went to the police-office the next day and saw Mr. Baker—I went to my duty afterwards.

Cross-examined. Q. I believe there is a regulation in your force that you are not to drink with prosecutors or witnesses? A. No; we are not allowed to go into public-house when on duty, but we are allowed to drink—I did not go to a public-house with the prosecutor after the affair was over—I did not go to a house where the last witness and the two undertakers were, and the prosecutor, at any time the next day.

COURT. Q. Do you know Mr. Baker by sight? A. Yes—I remember meeting him at the police-office—I did not go away form the office with him—I went on my duty—I did not drink with him the next day—he did not pay one shilling.

Prisoner's Defence. I fell in with the prosecutor—he was very much in liquor, and gave me these papers to take care of—I asked him to go home—I was going, and met Baker, who forced me back, and than I produced the papers, and said that was all belonging to him.
(Cornelius Faulkner, of Red Cross-street, Borough; John Gilder, of Norwich-court; and Henry Dowset, a butcher, or Red Cross-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)

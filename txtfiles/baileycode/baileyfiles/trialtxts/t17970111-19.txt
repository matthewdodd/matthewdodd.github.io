                   MABBELY
               



             sworn. - I am a French-man, a waiter
, in Canterbury; I met the prisoner in the Haymarket, about twelve o'clock at night, on the 31st of December; I was coming out of the Opera-house with a friend, and the prisoner spoke to me; we met in the Haymarket two women unknown to us, apparently well-dressed; they asked us to walk home with them; we at first resisted their offer, but on being asked several times, we complied with their wishes, and went to Whitcomb-street


, to Mrs. Brown's; being there, the prisoner asked me for one shilling for the use of the lodging; she said, it was customary for every gentleman that came to the house to pay one shilling, and I complied with her request, and gave her one shilling; that one shilling I took out of my waistcoat pocket; then I sat on the bed and took her on my knee; a little while after I felt her hand in my waistcoat pocket, where my money was; stop, says I, and I got up to see whether my money was right, and she took the opportunity of going out of the room, while I looked to see if my money was right; she was not out above one minute, and she came in again, and I told her, Ma'am, you have robbed me of three guineas and an half; upon that, she said it was no such thing; and I told her, if she would not return me the money again, I would send for the watch; she began crying and swearing that she had not got the money; and I told her again, if you will not choose to return the money, I will certainly charge you with the watch, and I will prosecute you; she told me after, you may search me all over, and you will be satisfied that I have not got the money; she pulled her shoes off, and shook her cloaths, but no money; while she was shaking her cloaths, my friend perceived that she had the money in her mouth, and I told her, you have got the money in your mouth, and says she, I have not got it; and finding herself guilty, she swallowed up the money, except one guinea, that my friend put his hand in and stopped it; in going down stairs to see for the watchman, she dropped a very remarkable sixpence that was-in my pocket, a French one, with a little hole in it; I saw it just before I went into the room, and she dropped it down on the stairs; and the watch came, and they took her to St. Martin's watch-house; the sixpence sell exactly under her; I heard it fall; I have spent it since; going to the watch-house, she asked me to go to her lodging, and she would make the money up and give me the two guineas and a half back; I told her I would not go to her lodging, but if she would send any body for the money, I was very ready to make it up with her.
Q. Had you been drinking at all before you went to the Opera? - A. Hardly any thing; my friend and I had drank a bottle of wine after dinner, and no more; that was a long while before the Opera.
Q. Were you quite sober? - A. Yes.
Prisoner. Q. Ask him whether I did not give him ocular proof that I could not swallow not the size of a pea; for I have been lock-jawed these three months.

             sworn. - I am a foreigner; I came from Flanders; I dined with Mabbely, and we drank a bottle of wine, and went to the Opera-house after we spent the afternoon.
Q. Were you present at the beginning of the Opera? - A. Yes; when we came out, we met with the prisoner and another woman in the same dress, and they asked us to go home with them to Mrs. Brown's in Whitcomb-street; we did not mean to stop with them, but only drink a little together, and talk with them; my friend fancied this woman, and they were talking together, and the other woman attempted to rob me; my friend told me he was robbed in French, and then I saw this woman wanted to run away; she went out about half a minute, and I said, stop, come in; she came in, and directly my friend said, you have robbed me of three guineas and a half; she began to swear she had not, and she pulled off her shoes and shook her cloaths, and I saw it in her mouth, and directly as I said so, she tried to swallow up the money, and she became directly very black, and I put my hand to her throat to stop it, and she spit out a guinea, and then she would not own it; then we could not get the other guineas, because they were gone, and then we called the watchman; as we came down stairs, we were in the room below waiting for a watchman, she dropped downa sixpence, and my friend picked it up; I saw it was a French sixpence, with a hole bored in it; and as we were going to the watch-house, she offered to go back to her lodgings, and she would make it up; he said, if she would send for the money he would; next Monday, at Bow-street, she said, she would make it up, and would send a woman to pawn her cloaths to get it.
Prisoner's defence. I never saw the money; the sixpence came from the pawnbroker's; it fell from my bosom; he told me he would not prosecute me, if I gave him a guinea and a half; I asked him if he knew the consequence of an oath, and to take an innocent person's life away; he said, he had lost a guinea by not going down by the coach, and he was determined to have it; he acknowledged himself on the Sunday to be in liquor, and wished he had not given charge of me, and on the Monday he said, will you give me a guinea and a half of the money; I said; I could not make it out; I am very innocent of it.
For the Prisoner.

             sworn. - Q. Were you in company with the prisoner? - A. No.
Q. What are you? - A. I go out to work, and get my bread in an honest way.
Q. What do you know of this matter? - A. I have known the prisoner between four and five years.
Q. What do you know of any offer made by the prosecutor, the Frenchman? - A. She got into trouble, and sent for me on the Sunday to the watch-house; I went to her on the Monday morning, and the gentleman was there; and he said, if she would give him a guinea and a half, he would make it up; if she did not, he would prosecute her as the law directs.

; I do not know the parish. I went out about two o'clock, latched the door, and took the key with me, I thought I had locked it - I left nobody there. When I returned, I found the prisoner coming out; I missed the watch from the fire-place. I ran after him-the constable stopped him, and found the watch. The latch was fast.

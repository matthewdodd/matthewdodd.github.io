             sworn.
I followed the prisoner one night by desire of one of the partners in our house, I spoke to him about a gun he had to sell as I understood, and we went to the Castle in Wood-street, a constable was sent, he was searched, and we found a piece of goods on him belonging to the house, about two yards and a quarter of silk goods (The goods produced); he said, it was the first thing he had ever taken without their knowledge.
Prisoner's Counsel. You was present when the constable said, he had better speak to his master? - No, I cannot swear to the stuff, but I can to the paper that contained it, as the private mark of the company is on it.
Was it not cut off by him for a Waistcoat? - No, it was a remnant; it was in this paper and pulled out of his pocket.
Aye, that we all know, there is a vast quantity of this paper about your shop? - The length corresponds with the mark.

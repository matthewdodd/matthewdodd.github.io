            . I am a publican
 at King James's Stairs, Shadwell



. I missed my tankard about five in the afternoon, on the seventh of June, out of my top-room: I found the two prisoners, Leegroves and Bailis, and 
               
                  Richard
                   Eaton
               



            , drinking in the tap-room; they had a tankard of beer, and some gin; I observed the tankard; it was a particular fashioned one; it stood upon the bench by the side of the prisoners; I happened to have occasion to go out; when I came back again, the prisoners were gone, and very soon after the waiter missed the tankard: there were several other companies of people in the tap room; but there were nobody but these people in that box where the tankard was. I took the prisosoners next morning: they plied at the stairs near my house.
Q. Did they appear publickly about their business.
Newsham. Yes; Bailis in particular came into the house; I suppose they had had some information that I was after them, and so chose to put the best countenance on it, and shew themselves. I thought they were all in liquor.

            . I live with Mr. Newsham; Bailis and Eaton came in first, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and called for a pint of beer; they drank that, and then they called for a tankard; I told them the tankards, I believed, were all engaged; they complained of that and said, D - n you, or b - t you, we will drink in silver as well as another, our money is as good as another's. Finding them uneasy, I got them a tankard; they drank two tankards of beer; Groves came in, either about the latter end of the first, or the beginning of the second; he drank part of the beer with them; the tankard was afterwards missed in the way my master has given an account of.
Q. Do you think they were in liquor?
Wrist. I do not think they were.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Newsham; I took the reckoning of these people about half an hour past three o'clock; they put their money down on the table: at that time I did not see the tankard; I had seen it about two o'clock. I remember one went out a little before the rest, in order to stow their boats, as I understood.

            . The two prisoners, Groves and Eaton, came to my house one Friday afternoon before our sabbath, about a month ago, and wanted me to buy some plate; I refused to look at it, so I don't know what it was. I live in St. Catharine's; I keep a shop, and sell silver.


                  Richard
                   Eaton
               



            . Bailis and I went into the prosecutor's house to have some beer, about eleven o'clock, on Friday the first of June; we had five pots of beer; some in a tankard, with a lid, and two or three half pints of gin; one of us put the tankard on the bench by him, when the gin was on the table, and Bailis put it in his pocket; then he went out with pretence of stowing his boat, and carried the tankard to his father's we paid our reckoning, and then went away; Bailis went first, and we followed him to his father's; Bailis unlocked the door, went up; and brought the tankard down. Then we went away to

                   Hart
               



            , and asked him to buy some plate; he said he had been in trouble before, and would not meddle with it; but he gave us something to drink: then we took a boat, and went over to Rotherhithe, to a man we thought would do it for us; he said he never did such things, and gave us a direction to a man in Dukes-Place, or Petticoat-lane, or thereabout; we went back to St. Catharine's, went through the Minories, and so to Petticoat-lane, or Dukes-Place, I can't say certainly the place; we went to the place we had been directed to, but could not find the man: from thence we went down to one

                   Cassandra

                   Davis
               



             with Groves, to shew him a fence; * he returned again, and brought two pounds, eleven shillings, and six-pence, and said that was the money the tankard came to: one of the prisoners said we would satisfy Cassandra, and Davis gave them three shillings, and then divided fifteen shillings a piece, which was just the amount of the money. Groves had nothing but his jacket on whilst he was at Newsham's, but afterwards put on Bailis's coat, and had the tankard in Bailis's great coat pocket, till it was carried out to this fence.
* A cant word for a person that buys stolen goods.

                   Davis
               



            . I live in Denmark-street. I was acquainted with this 
               
                  Judith
                   Cassandra
               



            ; she came to me on the sixth of June; she told me there was a man had a warrant against her; I let her be at my house; Eaton came in and asked for the old woman: I never saw him before; she asked me if I would be true to her; then she told me that these three men had been dragging for a dead man, and had got this tankard, and wanted me to go to a person to assist them in disposing of it, and directed me where to find out Lyons: Groves went with me to Dukes Place; there I found Lyons; Groves asked him if he bought such and such things; he said he did; he asked him what he gave an ounce; he said three shillings and six-pence, but he said he did not mind for another six-pence: we walked about through several turnings, till we got into Bishopsgate-street; there we went up into Sweet-apple court; we went into a public house, and they gave me two-pence to buy some beer; while the Jew and he went away, they staid about twenty minutes; then they came back again, and the Jew paid two pounds, twelve shillings; sixpence was dededucted for the liquor; the money was two guineas, four shillings, a five and three-penny piece, and six pennyworth of half-pence. Groves and I went home; there we found the other two; they had had some more liquor, and were sleepy and in liquor.
Leegrove's Defence.
I am very innocent: this man, the evidence, went to the house half an hour before I went out. I was at home most of the day. I had liquor at the bar at the same house, after he went out.
Bailis's Defence.
I was in liquor; it was half an hour after we left the house before Eaton went away.
Lyon's Defence.
When I was apprehended, about a fortnight ago, I told the justice that I did not receive the tankard. I was taken ill on the king's birth day, as the doctor can prove it.

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Plough-street, Whitechapel. I attended

                   Lyons
               



             from the fifth of June.
Q. How do you know the date?
Benjamin. Because I am sure of it: if I get a patient, I always book it; it was on the Wednesday.
Q. Did he come to you, or you go to him?
Benjamin. I went to him in Petticoat-lane, some court or other, I believe they call it Bull Court.
Q. Had you ever attended him before?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. How far do you live off?
Benjamin. In Plough-street, Whitechapel, not far from the church.
Q. What time in the morning did you send to him?
Benjamin. It might be between eleven and twelve in the forenoon.
Q. Who came for you?
Benjamin. I believe a young fellow; I cannot justly recollect.
Q. Did you see Lyons?
Benjamin. Yes, at his house.
Q. What room was he in?
Benjamin. In his room, I believe; two pair of stairs.
Q. Was he up, or in bed?
Benjamin. In bed.
Q. What was the matter with him?
Benjamin. He had a pleurisy; I bled him.
Q. How long did you stay with him?
Benjamin. Best part of half an hour.
Q. How long was he before he got better of this?
Benjamin. I went to see him the evening. following. I attended him ten or eleven days.
Q. After you had bled him in the morning, when did you first see him again?
Benjamin. In the evening, about eight, or half after eight.
Q. Was he in bed, or up?
Benjamin. In bed.
Q. When did you see him again?
Benjamin. The usual time next morning; I go out about eleven or twelve.
Q. In what condition did you find him?
Benjamin. Very bad in bed; I ordered him medicines.
Q. Did you see him on Thursday?
Benjamin. Yes, in the evening; I always attended him twice a day.
Q. And upon Friday?
Benjamin. Yes, then I attended him between eleven and twelve.
Q. In what condition did you find him on Friday?
Benjamin. The same condition, rather worse; he was sick in bed.
Q. Was he able to get up, in your judgement?
Benjamin. Not as I know; to my thinking, he was not.
Q. What time did you see him afterwards?
Benjamine. It was after the Sabbath was begun, in the evening.
Q. What time in the evening?
Benjamin. Pretty near eight o'clock.
Q. Are you sure it was not past eight?
Benjamin. It might be past eight; I will not swear to it.
Q. Was it light or dark?
Benjamin. I am sure it was light.
Q. Where did you find him?
Benjamin. In the same place I left him in all the times.
Q. Did you find him in bed on Friday evening?
Benjamin. I believe he was in bed; to the best or my memory he was: I attended him in the morning, and desired him not to go out.

Q. In what situation was his on Friday evening; how did he appear
Benjamin. As a sick man.
Q. How did his appear?
Benjamin. A stitch in his side, with a pledrify: I bled him.
Q. Again?
Benjamin. Yes, on the Sunday following.
Q. Was he not bled between Wednesday and Sunday?
Benjamin. No.
Q. Do you think he was able to get up or o out?
Benjamin. Not to go out, as I think.
Q. Did you see him again on Saturday morning?
Benjamin. Yes. He appeared much the same as usual, rather better. Sick people are generally better in a morning than an evening.
Court. How long have you known this man?
Benjamin. Five or six years.
Q. What way of life was he in?
Benjamin. That I cannot tell.
Q. Don't you know how he gets his living?
Benjamin. No.
Q. You have known him five or six years, and not know how he gets his living?
Benjamin. It is not my business; I don't enquire about such things.
Q. But your own patients, I should think, among your own people, you would know?
Benjamin. I understood he worked in the jewellery business.
Q. Has he any family?
Benjamin. A brother and sister, I believe.
Q. Is he a housekeeper?
Benjamin. I believe he is.

Q. How many days did he keep his bed?
Benjamin. I attended him nine or ten days.
Q. How many days did he keep his bed?
Benjamin. Four, or five, or six days, I will not say; I bled him on Sunday; he was not well then.
Q. I dare say you would not have bled him if he had been well?
Benjamin. I thought him ill.
Q. You say you attended him nine or ten days; he did not keep his bed all the time, did he?
Benjamin. That I will not say.
Q. Can you tell how long he did keep his bed?
Benjamin. I will not say he kept his bed any time, because I was not with him the time.
Q. But you can tell how often you found him it bed when you attended him?
Benjamin. I believe five days.
Q. Are you sure it was more than two days?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. Are you sure more than three?
Benjamin. That I am sure too.
Q. What will you say to four days?
Benjamin. I will not say to that. I am sure he was in bed on Sunday.
Q. That may be, that is an idle day. Are you sure of the day of the week when you first attended him?
Benjamin. Yes, on Wednesday.
Q. What day of the month was that?
Benjamin. The fifth of June, I believe.
Q. When did you hear first of this misfortune that had happened to him, that he was accused of this crime?
Benjamin. I was ordered to come here to attend this court.
Q. I ask you when you first heard of his being accused of this crime?
Benjamin. About a week or ten days ago.
Q. Did you not hear of it till a week or ten days ago?
Benjamin. No.
Q. You told us you entered the date in your book when patients commenced?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. You set down what you prescribe for them too?
Benjamin. Yes, in a book.
Q. Have you that book here?
Benjamin. No.
Q. What, is it in English or Hebrew?
Benjamin. Neither, it is in Latin.
Q. Did he send to you as soon as he was taken up, to let you know he was taken up?
Benjamin. No.
Q. Do you know what justice they had been before?
Benjamin. No.
Q. Was you never applied to before to attend here?
Benjamin. No.
Q. Who was in the house to take care of him when he was so ill?

Benjamin. I believe a young fellow that was in the house.
Q. Only a young fellow?
Benjamin. I cannot say who attended him.
Q. Had he any nurse?
Benjamin. I cannot say.
Q. I wish you had brought us that book of yours;
Benjamin. I have not got it here.
Q. How long should you be in fetching that book, we should have it here; I suppose there is entered in that book all you prescribed for him from time to time and his name?
Benjamin. I did not prescribe a great deal for him. I repeated the same medicine over and over again.
Q. What was it?
Benjamin. For a pleurisy, what I thought proper.
Q. Cannot you tell us what you thought proper to prescribe for him?
Benjamin. Only boluses.
Q. What was the composition?
Benjamin. The composition in plain English, is Venice treakle and spermaceti, and this I prescribed for him.
Q. And any thing else?
Benjamin. And powders thrice a day, powders of crabs eyes.
Q. I suppose you put down on your book all those prescriptions?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. In a regular day-book?
Benjamin. I do not keep a regular day-book, my business is not so great.
Q. But you must keep some book to make out your bills?
Benjamin. I have a small pocket book I keep it in.
Q. Then perhaps you may have that book about you?
Benjamin. I have not that book, I have another book.
Q. Where is that book, you keep it in Latin?
Benjamin. I must be at home at my house.
Q. Who have you at home any body that can give it if we send for it?
Benjamin. I do not think they can.
Court. It is of meat consequence to have your evidence established, (he takes out a little pocket book, and looks over it.)
Benjamin. I have not got it here.
Court. I should not think it likely you should have it there because you told me you entered down the time you first attended this man, entered the name and what you prescribed for him in Latin?
Benjamin. Yes, I entered it in my book.
Q. In Latin?
Benjamin. I entered it down on such a day.
Q. But in Latin?
Benjamin. I prescribed it in Latin to my druggist. I do not keep a shop.
Q. Well then, who is your druggist?
Benjamin. Mr. - what's his name; (there he appeared much confused, and made a long pause. I never was in a court in my life, nor nothing like it.
Court. Take time to consider of it, I asked you who that druggist was?
Benjamin. I cannot remember the name now.
Court. Not remember the name now, where does he live, surely you may know where he lives; I can forgive you for not remembering his name, but you must know where he lives?
Benjamin. He lives by Aldgate, the corner.
Mr. Rogers. There are two druggists there, one is Humphryes, and the other Crowther.
Benjamin. I believe it is Humphryes.
Q. You prescribe your medicines, and they are made up at a druggists, you must know who is your druggist you deal with?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. Who is this man you deal with?
Benjamin. Humphryes.
Q. Where does he live?
Benjamin. The corner of Little Duke's place, facing the pump, I believe.
Q. You must know your own druggist, tell me exactly where he lives?
Benjamin. I do as I know.
Q. How long have you lived in Plow-street?
Benjamin. Between three and four years.
Q. It is impossible you can be a stranger; you must know the spot exactly; where does he live, does he live opposite the pump, or where?
Benjamin. Not far from the pump, there are two or three live thereabouts.
Q. Which do you mean?
Benjamin. Only this one lives on the right-hand side of the way as you go towards the 'Change from Aldgate.

Q. Are you sure of that, that it is the right side of the way as you go towards the 'Change?
Benjamin. Yes
Q. Recollect yourself, is it the left-hand or the right-hand side of the way?
Benjamin. The right-hand side.
Q. Do you know the house?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. Can you show the house?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. How long have you dealt with Mr. Humphreys?
Benjamin. Three or four years.
Q. I suppose he has got upon his file all your prescriptions?
Benjamin. I gave no prescriptions, because I am no physician.
Q. How are your medicines made up?
Benjamin. I tell them what to take, and how they are to be mixed up.
Q. Remember you told me before, not having the medicines in your own house, you prescribed them in Latin for your druggist to make up?
Benjamin. I do.
Q. That is in writing?
Benjamin. No; I go there and tell him how to make it up.
Q. What do you go and tell them in Latin how to make it up?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. And if Mr. Humphreys was here, do you think that he would tell us that when you come to have your medicines made up, you prescribe them in Latin?
Benjamin. Yes, the very same.
Q. You dealt with this man three or four years, has he made up all your medicines during that time?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. In what way, for ready money, or was there an account between you?
Benjamin. Always for ready money.
Q. Do you think he would know you again?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. If you deal for ready money, how is it that you keep the account between yourself and patients?
Benjamin. Because I do not bring great bills in, I must have so much for the cure.
Q. How much had you for this young man's cure?
Benjamin. I am not paid yet.
Q. Have you the account?
Benjamin. No.
Q. Do you know how many times you attended him?
Benjamin. I do not go this way, if I bring a bill, I must be paid according to what I say.
Q. Do you know what quantity of medicines you sent to him?
Benjamin. No.
Q. Were all the medicines sent in to this young man, made up at Humphryes's?
Benjamin. No; I made up a great many at home, some drops that I keep.
Q. Recollect which of the medicines were made up at Humphryes's, when the young man was ill, that he had, and which you made up yourself?
Benjamin. I cannot justly recollect.
Q. You gave him repeated boluse's made of Venice treakle and spermaceti; you had not got these things yourself?
Benjamin. I bought sometimes a trifle and mixed them up afterwards myself at home.
Q. Did you do that in this instance, or send your prescriptions to Humphry's?
Benjamin. I went there the first time, I bought the things and mixed them up myself at home.
Q. Can you recollect what quantity of Venice treakle or spermaceti you bought at the time this young man was taken ill?
Benjamin. I cannot recollect.
Q. You only bought the quantity once at Mr. Humphryes's, and that was all?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. You told me you prescribed the medicines in Latin to your druggist; now I find there was no such prescription, for you only went and ordered so much spermeacti and Venice treakle?
Benjamin. No, my lord.
Q. Now, you seem to have been a little confused, and sometimes to have spoke not quite consistent with yourself in some part of your evidence; recollect yourself and tell us whether you are sure you ever attended this young man at all?
Benjamin. I am sure I have.

Q. And are you sure when you first began to attend him?
Benjamin. Yes.
Q. And what makes you sure as to the time?
Benjamin. Because I am positive: there was a fire-work on Tower-hill the day before.
Q. Can you recollect it by any other circumstances, except remembering a fire-work the day before; is there any thing else occasion your remembering it to be the next day after the fire-work?
Benjamin. I have got it down, it is the 5th of June.
Q. As you told me before you had entered it in your book, and the medicines in Latin you gave from time to time?
Benjamin. Not the medicines, I never do that, that is good for a druggist or apothecary.
Q. How came you to tell me you did do it; you know I asked you if it was in English or Hebrew, you told me in neither, it was in Latin; you understand Latin, I suppose?
Benjamin. A little.
Q. Can you turn Venice treakle and spermaceti into Latin?
Benjamin. Yes I can.
Q. What is Venice treakle in Latin? (here he pauses.)
Court. Perhaps you may have forgot. Can you tell me what is spermaceti.
Benjamin. Dreock is Venice treakle.
Q. What is the powder of crabs eyes?
Benjamin. Oculus concororam.
Q. Now I want to know where these entries are that you told me you made in Latin?
Benjamin. I did not make any entry in Latin.
Q. Well, do you now stand by it or not that when you go to your druggist you describe these drugs in Latin?
Benjamin. No; I only tell him what the drugs are I want, and then make them up myself.
Q. Then there are none of these prescriptions or descriptions in Latin, of your medicines? you have none?
Benjamin. No.
Council for Lyons
Q. Had this man, Lyons, any family?
Benjamin. I cannot say.
Q. Did you see his wife?
Benjamin. I saw a woman there, and there was a man there. I gave orders to the man in the room, to give him the medicines as I ordered.
Q. I suppose, if there had been a wife there to take care of him you would have taken notice of that; you would have given the directions to her, to be sure?
Benjamin. Yes, to be sure.

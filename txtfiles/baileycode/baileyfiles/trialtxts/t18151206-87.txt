            . I lost these two frocks, on the 28th of November, I live at 28, George-street, Grosvenor-square


. The prisoner at the bar came in and took these two frocks out of the basket, in the yard, adjoining the washhouse; I don't know how he got in. I ran after him crying stop thief! and he was stopped in Oxford-street, by a gentleman; he dropped the frocks in the yard, as he was making his escape.

HARRIET WARNER
. I am a widow, and live in York-court, Castle-street. I have known the prisoner a good while, and have employed her for three or four months to assist me in washing—I lost the property stated from the up stairs room—I did not miss it till the 20th—she had been at my house on Saturday, the 18th, and had the means of taking it—I suspected her, went with an officer to where she lived, and found some duplicates relating to this property.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Have you not known her some years? A. Yes, six or seven years, but she has not worked with me all that time—I had nobody else in my employ—the things were not locked up—I always had a good opinion of her.





JAMES BRANNAN
. I am a police-sergeant. I went with the prosecutrix to the prisoner's lodging—the prisoner opened the door to me—she gave me up some duplicates—part were in a pocket-book, and part I found between the bed and mattress—I went round to different pawnbrokers, and found the property.


Cross-examined. Q. Is she married? A. I believe so—she has no children, I believe.





JOHN STONE
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Old-street. I produce a number of articles which were pawned by the prisoner at different times.

Cross-examined. Q. When was this flannel pawned? A. On the 18th of November—I am sure the prisoner pawned it.





ALBERT KING
. I am a pawnbroker. I have three shifts and two aprons which were pawned by the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

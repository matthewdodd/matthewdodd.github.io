JOHN BIRD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of April, 1 coat, value 2l. the goods of 



John Robert Reay: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN ROBERT REAY
. I am a wine-merchant, living in Mark-lane. This is my coat—it was safe on Thursday morning, the 2nd of April.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you lose a pair of trowsers at the same time? A. Yes; which have not been found.





WILLIAM HILL
. I am porter to Mr. Reay. About half-past seven o'clock that morning I had the coat and trowsers to brush—I saw the prisoner coming out of the warehouse door with the coat under his arm—I asked him his business, and he threw the coat down—I caught him—this is the coat, it was placed inside the office door.

Cross-examined. Q. Is the office inside the door of the warehouse? A. Yes. I was coming out of the cellar, which is close by the warehouse—I was not a yard from him—I had a candle in my hand—I knew the coat directly—he walked away—I took up the coat and followed, and overtook him in Fenchurch-street—I have no doubt that he is the man.





JOHN SCOTT
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.
William Hurst, a weaver, of Manchester-street, Bethnal-green, gave the prisoner a good character.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I lost a cask of brandy of two gallons out of a cart, at Mr. Cole's, in Wells-street, Well-close-square


, which belonged to Mr. Woodham, I am carter to him; I lost it on the 12th of September, at ten minutes after seven, I do not know how it was lost; it never was recovered. Mrs. Mackenzie told me the cart was robbed, and that it was that long thief, Liverpool, took it.

             sworn.
I was coming down Wells-street, I saw this man make towards the cart, I thought it was a green cart; he put his right hand into the cart and lifted the cask up, and took it away, and put it under his left arm; I told the carter of him, and that he had run down an alley; I said I knew him, every body knows him. The next morning I saw him coming along the street, I stood out of his way, because every body knows he is a bad man: I am sure that is the man.
PRISONER.
I am innocent.

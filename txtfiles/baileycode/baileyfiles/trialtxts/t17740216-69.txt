            , Esq; About three weeks or a month ago I was out of town; I have a house in Naked Boy Court in the Strand



. During the time I was out of town, but what particular time I cannot tell, my house was robbed: I had left no one in the house, so I cannot give any account how it was done; for it was a considerable time after before I came to town and missed my things; the sash of the window was wrenched open; I apprehend they came in that way: the things were in the house when I went out of town; ( a waistcoat, two table spoons, five tea spoons, and some sugar tongs produced by 
               
                  Barnard
                   Barnard
               



            ) I believe they are mine, I had such; I am more sure as to the sugar tongs than the other things that they are mine.

            . I had these things of one of the accomplices; I was from home once or twice when they came; I saw them there when I came home. Garth asked 8 s. for the waistcoat; I understood him that he bought it for 6 s. he asked me 5 s. or 5 s. 6 d. an ounce for the plate; I agreed to give him 4 s. 6 d. I did not pay them, for I pretended I had no scales; suspecting the things were stole I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and the men came there and took two of the prisoners.
Mr. Stone. The handkerchief, the cane, and the spoons, were in the parlour, and two punch bowls.
Blanchard Clarke. (produces the two punch bowls, three shirts, a silk neckcloth, and a hanger) I found these things in Garth's Lodgings.


                  William
                   Halliburton

            's; I took Dickinson, Dizzey, and Laremore together: I took the cane away, I think, from Laremore, but I am not certain: I took the two women in Shire Lane.
Blanchard Clarke. I had been there before and could not find them there, but they were expected to come there again; I took a worked man's ruffle out of 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



            's pocket; these two women were up two pair of stairs in a house in Shire Lane; they were not there when Halliburton came, but came there afterward.

                   Taylor
               



            . (produces a pair of sheets and two tea-pots) I had them in a room up two pair of stairs forward in Shire Lane; I and Clark were there before Halliburton: the room belonged to

             told me where the sheets were, and likewise a table cloth, that they were gone to be washed; I went to the washerwoman's, and there they were found. I found there a silk cloak, two cannisters, and a pair of silk shoe patterns worked with gold; there was likewise a pair of double ruffles, three towels, and some shirts. I took one of the shirts off

             the witness's back; and all these things ( producing them) were in this room.
Mr. Stone. I cannot speak positively to the shirts; mine were marked, these are not; I don't see any place where the marks have been picked out.

             took lodgings of me; Walker then went by the name of Robinson, and they past as husband and wife; they took a room of me about five weeks since, but I turned them out the 25th January; in their lodgings were found a pair of spurs and a lanthorn, (producing them) the lodging was in a house that belonged to me opposite my dwelling house.
Mr. Stone . I had such a lanthorn; I believe it to be mine, I cannot be positive.

            . I know Dizzey and Dickinson very well; Dizzey is a jeweller, and Dickenson is a printer: I have been five years with Mr. Adam in Durham-yard, the great builder; I lived with him as an apprentice in the capacity of a plumber; I was not present at the time of the robbery myself, that was on Saturday night about six weeks since; I was not there. On the Sunday night 
               
                  Daniel
                   Laremore
               



             went with me to Mr. Stone's house; we had a key that opened the latch of the door; the lock was undone before, I apprehend, on Saturday night: we went up one pair of stairs; there we got a pair of sheets, two shirts, a riding habit, a man's hat, two large china bowls, a large china tea-pot, a muff, a coat, and a powder-horn; we took them to the room where the three men and Walker lodged in Long-Acre; we went a second time on Sunday night; then Dizzey went with us; I do not know whether these things particularly mentioned were taken the first time or the second time; Laremore came home that night, and lay with me in Chancery Lane , in White's Alley, at Dr. Scot's; my mother takes care of his house. On Monday Laremore went to this room ; I went after him; Laremore had the waistcoat, two table spoons and six tea spoons, and he sent them to Garth's; two punch bowls were likewise at Garth's, and the hanger; there we found some rings and a gold watch and chain put into a check case ; we took them to Long Acre, and Garth told us that he knew a Jew that lived in some square, I do not exactly recollect the name, that would buy them; Garth and I went there; he was not at home the first time ; we went a second time, and then we were bid to come again in the dusk; Laremore and I went to Garth's, and Garth and I went to the room in Long Acre; we met Laremore and Walker there; 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



            , Norbury, and Smith, carried the bowls and the hanger to Garth; we were to meet at the Elephant and Castle after we came from the Jew's; 
               
                  James
                   Garth
               



             went to the Jew's at dusk; we had the waistcoat, the spoons, the tea tongs, the watch and chain, but did not offer them to sale; we offered the waistcoat, we asked 8 s. for it, he bid us 6 s. we would not let him have it; afterwards he gave us 8 s. we asked 5 s. 9 d. an ounce for the silver; the Jew proposed 4 s. 6 d. we did not shew the watch and chain to the Jew; he asked for silver and when we produced it he said he wanted scales; he went with a pretence to fetch scales; staying a great while we suspected he was gone upon no good respecting us; we went therefore and found the watch, chain, and silver things in the dunghill; there was not the breadth of my hand distance between them: when we had done that the man came from Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's and searched us, and found nothing but the waistcoat; Garth said he had bought the waistcoat of a man in the street but did not know his name; the dunghill where we hid the things was opposite the Jew's room. Dizzey and Laremore waited near the church, about three hundred yards distance from the Jew's house.

                   Dizzey
               



             and myself met on the Saturday evening; we went to a public house and drank there till between twelve and one, then we came home to Charles-street in Long Acre; I saw 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Norbury

                   Smith
               



            ; I asked them where 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



             and Laremore were gone, and they seemed dubious of telling me; upon which I said I was sure they were gone to Mr. Stone's, for there had been conversation before about Mr Stone's; 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



             had told me of it; they attempted to get in a day or two before but could not, but thinking that 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



             and Laremore were there we went down and saw a light; I knocked at the door: 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



             came and enquired who was there, upon which I said it was I; then she asked me to explain myself; at last I said Jack; upon which we were admitted; as soon as I came in I saw a bundle of things by the fire place; I asked how they got in; 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



             told me they got in by the window, which was broke open, or wrenched open, with a chissel , in this bundle there was a silk gown, some dirty shirts, a table cloth, and some new cloth; 
               
                  Daniel
                   Laremore
               



             pulled the shirts out of his pocket, and a pair of paste buckles and knee buckles; there were some ear-rings too, and some small rings; there were six tea spoons, tea tongs, and two table spoons; the small rings were paste; there was likewise a gold watch and chain, a riding habit, a black silk cloak, a white dimity petticoat, a gold band and hat, a button and loop for a hat, some china cups and saucers, a bead necklace, and a silk neckcloth or two. Dickenson was going up stairs, but Robinson and Laremore said he need not go up, for they had been up stairs already.

             went a second night, but I was not there; there was a man's hat and a woman's habit hat, a looking glass, a coat, a pair of shoes, and a table cloth were brought to our lodgings: there were seven of us lay together that night, four men and the three women at the bar. Dickenson and Dizzey had a room one night in the Fleet-market; the landlord came up on Monday, and said he did not like our going on; that was the second night after the robbery: then Garth said, let us move some of the things, for the landlord will get a search warrant; upon which they took the two punch bowls and the hanger to Garth's lodgings; and Garth had the tea spoons and the other spoons and the silver; and Blair and Garth went to the Jew's to sell them; the riding habit was pawned by 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Norbury
               



             and 
               
                  Jane
                   Robinson
               



            ; they went to pawn the sheets, but they would not take them in being dirty; on which they went to get them washed, and they were left at the washerwoman's; and they pawned the silk gown.
Garth's Defence.
I am a breeches maker. Blair asked me to take a walk with him; I did do so; we went to the Jew's; there were some silver things carried; I know nothing of the matter, for Blair had them and produced them; I was ignorant of the whole affair.
Norbury's Defence.
I know nothing at all about it; I am quite innocent.
Smith's Defence.
I know nothing about it; I am innocent of it.
For Dizzey .

            . I am a jeweller; Dizzey was apprentice to me; I had a handsome premium with him; he behaved very well , very honest: I have often trusted him with money to the amount of 100 l. and not a fortnight before he was charged with this I had trusted him with 60 l. he was always in the shop; he had opportunities of taking gold and silver and diamonds, but he never did: was I satisfied that his morals were not corrupted by the sad place he has been in lately, I would take him again if he was discharged.


                  John
                   Tonson
               



            , Esq; I have known him ten years; I know his father and mother; he was a very dutiful child as I understood; I never heard any harm of him till this; I cannot help thinking that if he is guilty of this he must have been intoxicated and drawn into it; I cannot think he could be capable in his senses of doing such an act.


                  George
                   Garrick
               



            , Esq; I have known him five years; he used to come to my house often; I admitted him into the parlour; I looked upon him to be a diligent lad, and had no scruple to think him a proper companion for my children; he is about fourteen years old.
Mr. Asbridge. I have known him from his birth; I looked upon him to be one of the best of boys; I have trusted him with money and goods.
For Robinson.
- Dodd. I have known her four years: her father was a smith, and lived in good credit; his widow now lives in great credit: I looked upon the girl to be a sober girl; she has been in my house months together.
- Creamer. I have known her five years; I have often trusted her; she had a very good character, and I would now take her again.

                   Blunt
               



             . I have known her ever since she was born; she has a very good character.
- Blow. I have known her from her birth; I always thought her an honest sober girl.

For Dickenson.
- Wilkinson. I am a printer: Dickenson was apprentice to me; he behaved extremely well; he had a very good character, and was extremely useful; he acted so politely and civilly to all the customers , that they all spoke of him with very great commendation. I was in the country for four months together, on account of my illness, and he had the principal management of my business, and behaved vastly well to the customers; he had not been absent but about six days during the time of this unfortunate accident.
- Nowell. I have known him five years, he always behaved well, and had a good character.
For Laremore.
- Madden. I have known him from his infancy; he was an honest sober lad.


                  John
                   Prior
               



            . I live at Uxbridge ; I have known his father and him three or four years; he had always a good character.
For Smith.


                  Richard
                   Bream
               



            . Smith lodged with me three years together; she always had a good character.


                  Susannah
                   Smith
               



            . She lodged with me half a year; she has a very good character; her mother goes out to nurse people in their illness, or lying-in, and she has an extraordinary character.
For Garth.
- Powell. I have known him some time, but his brother is more particularly my acquaintance; he had that opinion of him that he set him up in his business.
For Norbury.


                  Thomas
                   Nowell
               



            . I have known her four or five years; I thought her a diligent honest girl; I never heard of any reflection upon her.
- Norbury. I am her father; she never offended me before in her life; I wonder how she could be so deluded.

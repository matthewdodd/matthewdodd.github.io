            . I am an old officer
. I was going home to my house in Sommers Town, on the night in question; the prisoner passed me in the street, laid hold of my arm, and walked some way with me. I missed my watch; she ran into a house, and I followed her, and a woman there locked the door between her and me. I called the watchman; he sprung his rattle; he said, he knew her. In a few minutes he took her, and found the watch upon her.

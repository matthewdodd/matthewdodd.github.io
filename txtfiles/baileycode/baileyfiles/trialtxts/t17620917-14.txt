            . I am a pawnbroker: On the 30th of last August, the prisoner brought these buckles to me [Produced in court, deposed to by the prosecutor]; she said they were her husband's; I lent her 10 s. upon them; and on the 13th of this month, the prosecutor came with the prisoner and demanded them. I said, as they were stole, she should not go out of my house till charged with a constable. I sent for one, who took her in charge.

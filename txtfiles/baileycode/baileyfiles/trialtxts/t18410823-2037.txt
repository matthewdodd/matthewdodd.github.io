RICHARD MORE
. I am beadle at Covent-garden market. On the 24th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in company—I saw the prisoner Henry Smith put his hand into the prosecutor's right-hand trowsers'-pocket and sound it—I then saw Charles Smith lift up the tail of the prosecutor's coat, and take the handkerchief out, and give it to Henry Smith.





HENRY PARKER
. This is my handkerchief—I was there that morning, and lost it—the handkerchief was in the officer's hand when I saw it.

Henry Smith's Defence. I stopped to see some persons buy some fruit, and a gentleman took me and my brother by the collar.

HENRY SMITH—


GUILTY

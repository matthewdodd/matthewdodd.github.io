Prisoner. Q.You know your son was married at the time? A. No, he was not; I went to church with you.
Q. Yes, he was married to a Miss Williams, and he brought her home to you? A. No - he had been married to a widow woman, and lived with her six years; I was with her when she died - he was a widower, and was married to the prisoner as a widower; he is still living.
Q. That was not Miss Williams, she came from Worcester? A. I knew a person of the name of Williams, but, upon my oath, he was never married to any other woman but the prisoner; he brought no woman home to my house - I keep a public-house; he did not live with her in Furnival's Inn-court.

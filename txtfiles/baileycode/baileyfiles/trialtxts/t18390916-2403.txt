JOSEPH BOWLING
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of July, 1 coat, value 5s.; and 1 waistcoat, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



William Ibbott; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






SARAH MAYNE
. I live in Bloomsbury-street. On the afternoon of

the 12th of July I saw the prisoner at Mr. Ibbott's, No. 13.—the window was open a little way, and I saw him take out a coat and waistcoat through the window—the waistcoat lodged on the window-sill, but he ran away with the coat, leaving the waistcoat—I opened my window, and called, "Stop thief,"—he dropped the coat, and ran away.

Prisoner. She said I opened the window. Witness. No, I did not—I was particularly asked that, and I said I could not say that he opened the window—I saw a person pick the coat up.





WILLIAM IBBOTT
. I live in Bloomsbury-street. This coat and waist-coat are mine—they were in my parlour on the morning of the 12th of July, near the window—I was not at home at the time they were taken.





DUNCAN GRANT
 (police-constable B 80.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I stopped the prisoner, and brought him back to the prosecutor's house—the things were produced to me at the door by a woman.





FRANCES IBBOTT
. The coat was brought to me—I do not know by whom, but it is the one that was taken from our window.

Prisoner. I had nowhere to go—I did it from distress.





JOHN GRAY
 (police-constable C 14.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was in the Court when he was tried—he is the same person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

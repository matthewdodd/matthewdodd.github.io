DAVID BARRY
. I live in Bell's-buildings, Salisbury-square. At a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, on the 5th of May, I was coming home—the prisoner came up, and asked the nearest way to Leather-lane—I told him—he then laid hold of my watch, took it off, and broke the guard—I laid hold of him, and he handed the watch to the others who were with him—a gentleman came up, and I took the prisoner to Scotland-yard.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where was this? A. Near Charing-cross, on the pavement, by the Duke of Northumberland's—I saw no other

persons going along, but those that came to me—I was holding the prisoner—a gentleman came and asked what I was holding him for, and he walked with me to the station—I charged the gentleman on suspicion, but he was a respectable man—the inspector knew him, and he was discharged—I was not the worse for liquor—I had been drinking porter—I had had a glass of gin and water at ten o'clock—I had had my tea at seven o'clock—I had drank nothing else all day—I am a porter.





WILLIAM TROUNCE
 (police-constable A 53.) I took the prisoner—I found the prosecutor's watch-chain was broken, and hanging down his waistcoat—the prisoner gave his address, No. 28, Little Earl-street—I went there, but no such person was known there.

Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he was passing by, and the prosecutor charged him with stealing his watch? A. Yes—the prosecutor was under the influence of liquor—he could walk straight—I found nothing on the prisoner—I found a Mr. Duggin who the prisoner said was his father, but he had no son.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.***—


Transported for Ten Years.

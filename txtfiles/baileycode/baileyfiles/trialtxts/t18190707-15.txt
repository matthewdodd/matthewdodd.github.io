            . I am a carman in the employ of Reeves and Co., who are carters. On the 15th of May I was employed to carry goods from the prosecutors' warehouse in Leadenhall-market; I took my cart there about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, and saw both the prisoners at the warehouse, they delivered four bags of nails to me to carry to Rotten-row, Old-street, to an old iron shop. I delivered them there.
Q. Did either of the prisoners accompany you - A. Oxenham accompanied me as far as Old-street; after I had delivered the nails I returned to him, and he paid me 4 s. 6 d. for the cartage.
Q. Had you been employed by the prosecutors on other occasions - A. Yes; we used to enter the work, and were not paid by the job. My master used to collect the money. In consequence of this circumstance I mentioned it to the prosecutors' servant.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you lived with Reeves and Co. - A. Above six years. I told the prosecutors of it about a week after.

            . I am an ironmonger, and live in Gracechurch-street, we have a warehouse in Leadenhall-market. Oxenham was warehouseman, and Fossey was the porter - they had no authority to deliver goods without an order from the house, either verbal or written - they had no orders to deliver four bags of nails on the15th of May, at seven o'clock in the morning, it was before the hours of business. Reeves and Co. were our carters, we had not employed them that morning - we pay them at the end of the quarter. I am executor to my father, and my mother is executrix.
Cross-examined. Q. Have you missed property - A. We missed several articles. The prisoners remained in our employ for a month after the robbery; we set a watch on them, but could discover nothing amiss. Oxenham had the key of the warehouse.

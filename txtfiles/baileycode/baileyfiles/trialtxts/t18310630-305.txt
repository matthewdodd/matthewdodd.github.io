            . I am a compositor
, and live in Platt-terrace, Somers'-town. On the morning of the 29th of May, between two and three o'clock, I met the prisoner in Holborn, and went with her to a house in West-street


 - I was in the room about half an hour; she put her hand into my left side waistcoat pocket, and took out my money - I had a half-sovereign, a 5s. piece, and three shillings, which were all safe when I went into the house; I charged her with it, she denied it, and put on her bonnet to leave the room - I followed, called the Police, and she was taken.
Prisoner. You know you gave me the money; and often asked me to live with you. Witness. I never saw her before.

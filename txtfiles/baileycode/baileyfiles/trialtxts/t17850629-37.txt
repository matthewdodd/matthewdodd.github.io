                  JOHN
                   CAMMELL
               



             sworn.
What is the prosecutor? - General


                  Plaistow
               


            . I was charged with the care of the General's house; I saw the thieves go in and come out; I believe I was the last person that left the house, I am not sure, I double locked the door.
Were there any children in the house? - No, the door was double locked the day before, I believe nobody was that day in the house but the thieves; on the Wednesday night I saw the prisoner Brease, and a chimney-sweeper go in without anything; the house has been inhabited by the General some time since, but there has been an action lately, and some things were there, they were General 
               
                  Plaistow
               


            's: about half after eight, or within a few minutes, I saw a fellow with a porter's knot on his back, just opposite the General's door; then the prisoner came up soon after, and they walked into the house as regular as if they had a key, in three minutes they came out, and I seized the prisoner with a grate on his back; I do not know the name of them, I believe they are called patent stoves; I found this pick-lock key on the prisoner, which opens the door; the next day at the prisoner's lodgings, we found two china images at the lodging of the man prisoner; he said they were his, and the woman of the house told me so.

                   CROCKER
               



             sworn.
I am constable of St. Pancras, where this robbery was committed, I went to the lodgings of the man and woman prisoners, they both lodged together, when I came there, I found those two china images, they have been in Cammell's possession ever since.


                  GEORGE

             sworn.

                  FRANCIS
                   PLAISTOW
               



             sworn.
I am the General's son, I have surveyed these images, and they are my father's property, I believe them to be his, I entertain no doubt about it: the stove is called a patent stove.


                  WILLIAM

             sworn.
I am a tripeman, I have known the prisoner Brease fifteen or sixteen years.
What has been his general character the last year or two? - Very indifferent.

             I have known these twenty-three years.
Court to Jury. Gentlemen , a dwelling house is within the intent and meaning of the act of parliament an inhabited house, it appears in evidence here, that the prosecutor had left this house, and left some furniture, but never had an intention of returning, so that if this house had been broke open in the night time, it would not have been a burglary, therefore you must acquit him of the capital part of the charge.

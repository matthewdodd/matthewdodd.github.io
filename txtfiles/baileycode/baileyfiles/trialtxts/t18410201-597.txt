JOHN COTTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of January, I coat, value 15s.; and 1 pair of gloves, value 1s.; the goods of 



Richard Baker.






RICHARD BAKER
. On the 12th of January I was in Nicholl-square, Aldersgate-street, with my wagon—a wagoner fell down—while I was assisting him I lost my coat and a pair of gloves which I had left on my horse.





JOHN INGOLD
. In consequence of what Baker told me I went in search of the prisoner, and found the coat on his back and the gloves in his hand, about five minutes after the accident, in Maidenhead-court, Moor-lane, Fore-street.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Fore-street, to go to my uncle's, and Ingold said, "Have you got any thing to do? I said, "No;" he said, "Come with me, I will give you something"—he took me down a lane in Fore-street, and said, "Are you cold?" I said, "Yes;" he said, "Put this on;" I did, and he tied my hands behind me.





JOHN INGOLD

re-examined. I was with the prosecutor, and was assisting

in picking up the wagoner when the coat was taken—I went one way, and the prosecutor the other.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             two Brethren, and both young Men, were indicted for

             They came both together to Mr. Jones's House, called for Drink, and after they had drank three Tankards they escaped away with the Tankard but were soon taken; one of them, to put a better Colour on their design, was drest up in Womens Apparel, which was found to be Thomas, who immediately 


               confest
             the Fact upon his Arraignment, but John pleaded not guilty, and was tried for the Fact, and it appeared that he was at Mr. Jones's with his Brother John so Aparell'd as abovesaid; and that the Prisoner said to John, My Dear make haste home, and went away first with the Tankard; he could offer nothing to the Court material for himself, the matter being clear against him, so he was found 

               guilty
            .

            . I was at the packing up of these goods, they were directed to

                  Money

                  David 
                  Day 
               



            . I have a ware-house at Summers's key, and these goods mentioned were put into it, I think on Saturday the first of June : they were the goods of 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Fludyer 
               



            , Esq; and Co. to go by the William and Mary, 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Palmer 
               



            . The prisoner work'd with me but on the Saturday before, and on the Saturday night I believe the goods were taken out of the ware-house. My clark told me they were gone on Monday morning, and said, the constable, 
               
                  Robert 
                  Lucas 
               



            , had got two pieces of the things that were in the bale, and a great coat. We sent for the constable, he came, and when I saw the great coat, I knew it well. Said I, that is 
               
                  Jack 
                  Howard 
               



            's, which he had on the Saturday night at six o'clock when he was paid. I sent for a neighbour, and ask'd if he knew the coat, (it was produced in court) he said, it was 
               
                  Jack 
                  Howard 
               



            's coat, and that he saw him with it on Saturday last. Then I sent two constables to go and look after him, Lucas and Marshal, they went and could not find him. There was one 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Mills 
               



             that work'd with me, I ask'd him if he knew where Howard was, and he proposed to go and find him for me. We found him in Rosemary-lane, I laid hold on him, and we took him to Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            's, before whom he confess'd the taking the goods, and bringing them to a woman, but would not say who: swearing, he would not bring any body else in, but would suffer himself. I ask'd him what he had done with his coat; he said, he had sold it to a sailor for sixpence; but now he was well rigg'd.


                  John 
                  Price 
               



            . I am a watchman : I saw the prisoner between one and two o'clock on the Sunday morning, he had them two pieces wrap'd up in his great coat: I left my lanthorn hanging on a hook and came to him, seeing him creep close by the wall: he said, what be that? I clap'd my hand under his coat and found them to be base goods: I said, I desire you will go before the constable of the night. Said he, I don't choose it. He seized my staff and was too strong for me, so he got away, and left his great coat which he had on his back, and two pieces of cloth in his pockets, his dog staid with the things. I am positive the prisoner is the man.


                  Robert 
                  Lucas 
               



            . I am constable: I found the two pieces of serge in the street while the last witness was pursuing the prisoner, they were in the great coat, and the prisoner's dog stood by them. I heard the prisoner say before the Justice, he took the goods mentioned out of the ware-house of Mr. Day, and had given two pieces to a woman; but said, he would not say any more, and would rather suffer himself than bring any others in.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was at home that night abed.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the ware-house
            .

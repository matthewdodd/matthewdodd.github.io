 for stealing, on the

ANN NASH
. I am servant to Sarah Brownell, a widow, in Marlhorough-place, Kennington, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. About the 2nd of February, a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, came and offered some fowls for sale—he asked me to show them to my mistress, who was in the parlour—I did so—I saw the watch on the table just before—mistress did not wish to buy the fowl—he asked 3s. for it, and then half-a-crown—I disputed the fowl being young, and he said he would leave it and call for the money in a fortnight—he went away leaving it, and did not call for the money—I never saw him again till he was taken up—mistress's watch was missing when he was gone—this is it—(looking at it.)





AMBROSE BRADLEY
. I am a pawnbroker. On the 6th of March, I was at Mr. Sowerby's, a pawnbroker, who lives in the same street as I do—while I was in the dining-room, this watch was brought up to him as offered to pawn for 25s.—Mr. Sowerby being ill, requested me to go down and question the person—I went down and saw the prisoner—I asked him if it was his watch—he said "Yes"—that he bought it of a man in the street and gave him 3l. for it, and he had had it six months—it was a gold watch—I should value it at 10l.—I gave him in custody.




GUILTY
. Aged 44.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

            ; they live in Carnavonshire in North Wales. On the 20th of October I was returning from Maidstone in Kent, I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Shadwell
               



             the younger at a small distance from the Swan at Crayford; she said, Welchman, will you let me ride? I was riding one horse and leading another; I told her I did not care if she did, she did not ride. I went on to the Swan in Crayford


, she kept near me; when I came there I put up the horses and went into a box in the tap-room and in a few minutes 
               
                  Mary 
                  Shadwell
               



             the younger came in, I had some bread and cheese and a pint of beer; she said, Welchman, will you let me drink with you; she sat in the box very near the side of me and called for a pipe of tobacco, after that she called for another and shifted and sat on the right side of the box. After I had drank the pint of beer I had a glass of rum and been very much fatigued three days before, I put my head on the box and slept for half an hour to the best of my recollection, the landlord informed me something; when I awoke the prisoner was gone, I afterwards made an application to a constable there, he refused to give me assistance, he is a baker at Crayford; this was on the Saturday, I came to London on the Monday morning, I gave some information at Bow-street.
Q. When you went into that public house at Crayford describe what you lost - A. I had three hundred and twelve pound in my breeches pocket, they consisted of Bank notes, Canterbury and Dartford notes, they were in brown paper - I had four twentys, more than five or six tens, and a good many fives, and from seven to ten ones; I have seen some of the notes since in the possession of Gillmore the officer. The money was all taken out of my pocket when I was asleep, and when I awoke the girl was gone.


                  EDWARD 
                  JONES
               



            . I keep the Checquer public house, in Tothill-street, Westminster. On the 22d of October the elder Shadwell came to my house about eight o'clock in the morning, the younger one came in about half past eleven, before she came in the elder woman offered me a country note for ten pound, I told the old woman I did not change country notes; she offered after another country note of ten pound. When the young Shadwell came in my servant called me into the bar, I looked at a tray in the cupboard, I saw many notes, my servant said they were Mrs. Shadwell's; she sells apples in the street, my servant said I was to give them directions where to get them changed. I took them in the parlour and sorted them, there were fifty pound in country notes on Masterman and co. on Williams and Griffiths two five pound notes, five ten pound notes of Dartford, and six one pound Bank of England notes, in all, country notes one hundred and ten pound and six one pound Bank of England. I then asked 
               
                  Mary 
                  Shadwell
               



            , the elder, if she knew how many notes she had given me, she answered no; I gave her all these notes, she put the six one pound notes in her bosom, I told her they did not want any changing any where; I told the elder Shadwell there were proper directions at the back of each bundle were to get them changed. I suspected it was a robbery, I went to Queen-square office.


                  JOHN 
                  GILLMORE
               



            . I am an officer of Queen square. On Monday the 22d of October I and 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Renny
               



             pursued the prisoners into the city by the direction of Mr. Jones expecting to see them at the banker's; when I came into St. Paul's Church-yard I met an hackney coach with the two prisoners in it and four other persons, it was about one o'clock, they went to Ludgate-hill and were coming towards Westminster; I ordered the coachman to stop and immediately jumped into the coach and said which of you ladies have got any thing for me, they said they did not know what I meant; I ordered the coachman to drive to Queen-square; going along I said which of you ladies have got bank notes, I asked them frequenly, at last one of them cried and pointed to the old woman said that is the woman that has got what you want; I said no one should put their hands into their pockets untill I had searched them; going along the Strand the elder prisoner said, now shall I speak? I told her she might do as she liked about that; she put her hand in her pocket and gave me a parcel.
Q. What relations are the prisoners - A. The elder one is mother-in-law; she conveyed to me fifty new onepound Bank notes, the elder one cried and said, Oh! Mary if you have any more give them to Mr. Gillmore, addressing herself to the younger prisoner I wish you had broke your neck before you had brought your father and me into this trouble. Mary pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket which contained some silver; I afterwards found two guineas, she gave me that and said that was all she had got of the money left, adding, you know, mother, I gave it all to you. When we came to the office the elder Shadwell gave me some more notes at the public house where we searched them, which made up in total one hundred and fifteen pound, I asked the old woman how she came by the fifty new notes; the young one was present, she said she had just received them at the banker's in change of five ten pound notes; I then asked the young one how she came possessed of all this money she told me that coming from Maidstone Fair she met with a Welchman who gave her the notes to take care of; I then called the mother of one side and told her that I heard that she had something more at home, I would wish to search her lodgings; I left the other prisoner in the care of my brother officer and went and searched the elder prisoner's lodgings at St. Hermit's-hill, I there found a quantity of new linen drapery goods, I asked her where she purchased them, she told me at Mr. Barrett's in the Broad-way, that she had left a twenty pound and a five pound for Mr. Barrett to change, that she had received no other change for the twenty-five pound than the goods that lay there, these are the new goods which I have here, and the notes, a twenty pound and a five pound they are both Rochester and Chatham Bank; I then traced a ten pound note in the hands of Mr. Cadmore a publican, making about one hundred and sixty pound; the elder prisoner told me there was fifty-five pound more in the hands of Mr. Battin a publican in Westminster, he denies all knowledge of it. When we went to Crayford I found a bundle which the younger prisoner claims, that is in court; she says she left it behind her at the Swan; I went there to fetch the landlord up, he has left the house.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BARRETT
               



            . I am the son of

            , linen draper, Chapel-street, Broad-way, Westminster. On the 22d of October, the two prisoners came to our shop, between seven and eight in the morning, they bought some goods and tendered a twenty pound note to me; that is my hand-writing on the back of the note, the five pound note was tendered in the house by these women; they are both Rochester and Chatham notes.
MARGERET WILLIAMS. On the 22d of October, the elder Shadwell came to my house, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, she said her daughter-in-law had come out of the country and had made her a present of a ten pound Dartford note, she left it with me to get it changed; I sent my little girl with the ten pound note to Mr. Chadmore.

                  CADMORE
               



            . I am a publican, Broad-way, Westminster; the daughter of the last witness brought this ten pound note to me.
Gillmore. That is the note I received from Mr. Cadmore, he heard of the robbery and sent the note.
Prosecutor. The number of the notes I have here that agree with the notes that I was robbed of by this girl.
Shadwell the elder. I know nothing of the robbery.
Shadwell the younger. I met the drover about a quarter of a mile before we came to the Swan in Crayford, he asked me if I would let him go with me. I told him yes, when I came to the public house he asked me what I would have to drink, he gave me beer and part of the rum, he called for bread and cheese, the reckoning came to four shillings and eight pence, he asked me if I would go down to his own country and live with him, I said I should look very foolish if he had a wife and family, he took out the money and gave it me in a bit of paper, he laid down his head on the table and I came out of doors.
Williams. What she says is entirely false.

               stealing, on the 8th of August

                  , from his person
            .
JOHN GITTINS. I lost my handkerchief on the 8th of August, while I was in King-street, Covent-garden


; I did not feel it go, nor see the persons, but, on missing it, I turned round and saw none of the prisoners near me - I had had it within half an hour.

            . I saw Pope pick this gentleman's pocket, while I was walking up King-street; the gentleman was walking with a lady, and the prisoner followed him; Pope drew the handkerchief several times a little further out of the pocket; he then took it quite out; the other two were close by, and must have seen what he did; I ran across, and gave Pope into the prosecutor's custody, and ran to Covent-garden, but the others had got away - I took them next morning. I had seen Pope hustling the handkerchief up in his hand, but whether he passed it to the others or not I cannot tell - it has not been found.
POPE'S Defence. I was out, looking for work, and this officer came, and said I had picked a pocket; as to those boys, I had never seen them before.
EVANS' Defence. I was at home at tea, with my father, before six o'clock.

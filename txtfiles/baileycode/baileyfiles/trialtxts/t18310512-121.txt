ROBERT CHALLIS. I live with Mr. James, of Foot's-cray, in Kent. I was in Oxford-street on the 15th of April - I saw the prisoner, and went with her to a house in St. Giles


; I went to bed with her, and in the morning she was gone - I missed every thing, but my shoes; I had left them on a chair in the room when I went to bed.

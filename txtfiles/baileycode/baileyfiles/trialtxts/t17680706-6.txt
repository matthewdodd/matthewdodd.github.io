            . I live in Marybone parish


; I lost two pigs on the 30th of May out of my yard; I saw them again at Mr. Oxlard's, and swore to them.
Mr. Oxlard. I live at Dulwich. On the 1st of June between nine and ten in the morning, I bought a pig of the prisoner at the bar for 22 s. and one Berier a labouring man bought another of him; they were both in a sty at Berier's; Mr. Clark's kinsman came and owned them.
Clark. My kinsman brought them both home to me at Lisson-green; my kinsman is not here.
Oxlard. I know Mr. Clark and his kinsman too.
Clark. I hearing where they were, sent my kinsman (named Ibord) for them.
Oxlard. The prisoner told me he brought them from Reading in Berkshire.

            . On the 31st of May I saw the prisoner driving the two pigs along the road at Dulwich; he said he was going to Sydenham to sell them; I bought one of them of him, and Mr. Oxlard came and agreed with him for the other; they were put into my sty; there were two clips on the shoulders on each of them, they were spotted black and white.
Clark. That is my mark, and they are as he describes them.
Prisoner's defence.
I bought these pigs at Hounslow fair on the Tuesday morning, of a man that had forty-seven pigs there.

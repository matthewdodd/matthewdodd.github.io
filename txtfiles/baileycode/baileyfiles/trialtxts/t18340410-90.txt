JOHN COZENS. I was in Fleet-street


 at half-past twelve o'clock in the morning, on the 7th of March - a gentleman asked me if. I had lost any thing - I then missed my handkerchief - the officer took it from Sycamore's bosom - this is it.

             (police-constable C 38). I was on duty, and saw Paine pick the prosecutor's pocket, and hand the handkerchief to Sycamore, who put it into his breast pocket - they then ran up St. Bride's avenue - Sycamore then turned towards Bride-lane - I collared him, and took the handkerchief from him.
Sycamore's Defence. I was coming down Fleet-street from Covent-garden market - I picked up this handkerchief, and put it into my pocket - I turned down the passage, and the officer took me - there had been no one with me - as we were going to Guildhall, another person came up with Paine.
Paine's Defence. I had been to see my sister, and in going down Fleet-street, a gentleman touched me on the shoulder, and said he wanted me for picking a gentleman's pocket - I said it was a falsity, but I would go with him.

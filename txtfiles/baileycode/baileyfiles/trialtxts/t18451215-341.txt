JAKE KEEBLE
. I am the wife of Philip Keeble—we live at Lambeth. On the 1st of Dec. we missed some dust-pans—these are them I am sure.





MART IRVIN
. I live in Lansdown-place, Sooth Lambeth. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 1st of Dec. I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Keeble's shop, and take two dust-pans, put them under her apron, and come out—I sent the servant over to tell Mrs. Keeble.





WILLIAM LUCAS
. I went after the prisoner—I saw her with the dust-pans—she saw me, and began to run—there was a hedge just by—she threw the dust-pans into the hedge, and ran on—a man stopped her, and I brought her back to my master's—she said if she begged the gentleman's pardon, would he let her go—these are the dust-pans—they were picked up in my sight.





JOHN BROWN
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, at the Newington Session—(read—Convicted 3rd Feb., 1845, and confined fourteen days)—the prisoner is the person.

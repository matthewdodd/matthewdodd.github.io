ALFRED JAMES REDFERN
. I am a chronometer-maker. On the 12th of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on the Southwark side of London-bridge—I felt a tug at my pocket, where I knew my handkerchief had been safe three minutes before—I turned round, and saw the prisoner, and another boy with him—the prisoner had my

handkerchief in his hand—he gave it to the other boy, who ran away—I took the prisoner—the other made his escape.

Prisoner. Why did not he catch hold of me when he saw me with it in my hand?—I was not near him—I was walking along, when he came and took me by the collar. Witness. I overtook him in Tooley-street—I asked him where he lived—he pointed down Tooley-street, and said he lived down there—I said I would go with him—he then said he lived in Bacon-street, Commercial-road; that he had come there for a walk, and to see the railroad.




GUILTY
.* Aged 12.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

FREDERICK HAYES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of April, 4 yards of canvas, value 1s. 6d.; 1 basket, value 3s.; 2 bottles, value 2s.; 3 gallons of ink, value 3s.; and 6 shillings; the goods of 



Richard Cooke, his master.






RICHARD COOKE
. I am an ink-maker, and live in New-street, Bartholomew-close. I wanted an errand-boy, and put a bill in the window—the prisoner came—his mother said he was a very good boy, and I took him on the 12th of April—on Wednesday, the 13th, I sent him out with a truck, three gallons of ink, and some gallon bottles, and gave him 6s—he was to call, in coming home, and bring me some goods back with the money—he did not bring the goods back, nor the money—I saw no more of the truck and things, and did not see him again till he was in custody.





HENRY SHERRIFF
. I am a policeman. I found the prisoner at hit father's door on Friday the 15th of April—I said, "I want you for the truck and goods of your master"—he said, "Let me see my father first"—I said, "You must come with me to the station'1—he said a boy had capsized the truck going along, and had spilt all the ink, and the money a boy had got from him in Shoreditch, that he had left the truck in the

care of a woman in Brick-lane while he went to ease himself, and when he came back, the woman had gone away with the truck and all, and a boy about his own age at the grocer's-shop had seen the woman go away with it—I went to make inquires, and there was no boy under seventeen years of age at any of the grocers' shops, about there.




GUILTY

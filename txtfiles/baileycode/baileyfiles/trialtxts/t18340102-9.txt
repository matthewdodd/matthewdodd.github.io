            . I am a salesman
, and live at 4, Field-lane, Holborn


, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. OnFriday, December 20th, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I put six dozen silk handkerchiefs on my bed-room table on the 2d floor; I did not miss them until the Saturday following; they were then gone from the bed-room table - I went up to the attic, and found somebody had got in at the garret window; the prisoner was employed at the next house, and I suspected him - it was an empty house, and he was at work repairing it - my bed-room window was shut, but the attic window was open; I examined the attic window of the next house and found the casement had been taken out, and somebody had got from there along the roof to my attic window - I had the prisoner taken up in consequence of suspicion - I went with him from his house to the station-house - he was taken into custody in his own apartment - I don't recollect saying any thing to him, except on going to the station-house he said in the presence of the policeman, if I would give him till eight o'clock in the morning he would tell me all about it; he was very tipsy at the time, and I told him what he had to say to reserve till he got to the station-house - I lost six dozen pair of gloves worth 10l.; some have been given up by a pawnbroker, and another pawnbroker has some here.
GOODMAN SOLOMON. I live in Field-lane; I have an empty house next door to Davis; I employed the prisoner to repair it for me - he was there several days - he was there on the Friday morning, 20th - he came to me that day and said he wanted 1s. to buy his dinner, which I gave him, and said, "Will you go to work immediately?" he said, "I shall, you may depend upon it." I went about an hour afterwards to see how the work went on, and missed him - I did not see him till seven o'clock in the evening, when he was coming out of the public-house door on Saffron Hill; he was drunk - I asked him for the keys to shut up the house; he said, "Here they are, go about your business;" he was then talking to a man with a cab at the door; I went to the house and shut it up; I went into a room in the house, and found the attic window taken off and thrown down on the floor - it was very easy to get from there to Davis's house; I could see by the footsteps somebody had been on the tiles; I went to the prisoner afterwards, and asked him what business he had to take out that window, because he had broken the hinge, - he said, "Why to dry the room to be sure;" there was no occasion to take it out, and he was not to work in that room.
Prisoner. The windows were taken out three weeks before. Witness. That window was in - one was taken out before, but not that.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Nicholls, a pawnbroker, living at No. 20, Gray's-Inn-Lane; I have brought here two silk handkerchiefs - I only took in one of them - I got that from James M'Carthy in the name of Sullivan; on Friday, the 20th of December, he pawned it, a shopman took in the other - he is not here; it has been in my possession ever since.
JAMES Mc CARTHY. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at No. 2, West-street, Spitalfields. On Friday the 20th, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in a beer-shop, on Saffron-hill - Powell came and asked if I would go and pawn a couple of handkerchiefs for him, and he would give me a trifle; he gave them to me - I asked where he got them from - he said, "What has that to do with you, so as I pay you?" so I went with them to Gray's-inn-lane, and pawned one at one place for 2s. - the other at another place for 2s. 6d. - I gave the money to the prisoner - he went with me and gave me something for doing it - I pawned four more for him the same day, three in St. Giles's - I can't say how many handkerchiefs he had - I went with him on the Friday night, about seven o'clock, to Monmouth-street, to a Jew, and sold twenty for a sovereign - he did not tell me where he got them - he said nothing about them that I heard - I was examined before the magistrate - oh yes, I remember, he told me he got them of Mr. Davis, and he said, "You have no occasion to say nothing" -"No," said I, "I won't:" and all the while I was in prison with him, he said, "If I said anything, he would say all he could to get me into a scrape myself - he said he got out at the window where he was at work, and got into Davis's and took them - he said, when he was before the magistrate, when we were both locked up, that he would endeavour to get me into the scrape.
SUSANNAH KING. I am a widow, and live in Newcourt, Saffron-hill. The prisoner lives in the next house to me - I came home on the evening of the 20th of December - he asked me to fetch a pot of beer, which I did, and had money from him to get some things out of pawn - he said,"Susan, will you take care of some money for me?" - he gave me 24s. in a piece of rag, that was on Friday night, and in about half an hour he fetched it back again.

            . I am a policeman of the G division. I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to the station-house, on Saturday the 21st., Davis was with me- I did not hear him say anything to Davis; at the station-house he said he was innocent of the crime, but as we went along, he said, If Davis would give him till to-morrow at eight o'clock, he would give him information where the property was - We had told him what we took him for - I was present at the prisoner's examination before the magistrate.


                  DAVID 
                  DAVIS
               



             re-examined. I was present at the examination, and I know Mr. Laing's handwriting; this is Mr. Laing's hand-writing - I did not see him write it, it was read over to the prisoner - I heard what he said - he was called on to say what he had to say to the charge - I don't think he was told he need not say anything unless he chose - the clerk read over to him what was taken down in my presence, and the prisoner said, Mc Carthy was as much in it as he was - I heard him say this myself - he said, he had nothing further to say, except that Mc Carthy was as guilty as he was, I am sure he said so - I don't recollect his saying anything more - the magistrate asked him if he understood what was read over to him - he said, Yes.
Prisoner. I am quite innocent of the robber; Davis can give me a seventeen years character.
DAVID DAVIS. He has been working about different premises of mine for about sixteen years in the neighbourhood - I never heard anything dishonest of him - I buy the handkerchiefs in lots, at about 32s. a dozen - we sell them at 36s. a dozen - they might not all have been taken at one time (looking at one of the two handkerchiefs) - there was two dozen of this sort, which is a misprinted handkerchief, and sold as a misprint - I saw this among five hundred, and I said this is one of the six dozen - the other one is mine -there are eight handkerchiefs altogether - the pawnbrokers gave them up at the magistrate's, sooner than have any bother about them - they are all mine.
JURY. Q.Have you had the whole of your property back again? A. I have had only about nine, the others have been disposed of, and the tickets thrown away; and he has sold one man twenty, and another sixteen, among people that I shall never get them back again.

             re-examined. Q.Was M'Carthy taken up at all? A. Yes, and he was remanded for three or four days, but not discharged; he is now brought here in custody; he said he knew nothing of the fact, and has said so all along; the policeman fetched him from the House of Correction, and brought him here this morning by order of the magistrate.

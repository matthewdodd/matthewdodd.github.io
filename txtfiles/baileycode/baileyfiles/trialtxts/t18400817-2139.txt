GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th of August, I saw the prisoner watching Mr. Coventry's shop in Old-street, for a quarter of an hour—there was a large pile of goods outside the door, and a covering over it—I saw the prisoner put his hand under the covering, and take this holland—he was walking off with it, and I took him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me pull it down? A. Yes, you had pulled at it for a quarter of an hour.

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday, the 5th of January, I saw the prisoners close to Richard Darvill's shop - he is a cheesemonger
; I saw Crisp take something from the window; Andrews was close to him at the time: they went away - I followed, and overtook them about twenty yards off; I found Crisp putting this hand of pork up between Andrews' short jacket; I found some biscuits on Andrews.
CRISP's Defence. I was going along, and declare to Almighty God I did nothing.
ANDREWS' Defence. Crisp gave me nothing.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of July 2 gowns, value 11s.; 1 cloak, value 10s.; and 1 pocket, value 6d.; the goods of 



Emily Manser; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






EMILY MANSER
. I am servant to Mr. Hobbs, at Kew, Surrey. I had a merino cloak, two gowns, and a pocket—I saw them safe about five o'clock, on the 21st of July, in my box, in a passage even with the kitchen—I missed them on the 24th—these are my things—(looking at them)—I do not know the prisoner.





THOMAS PARSONS
. I am a market-gardener. On the 22nd of July I pursued the prisoner from Barnes, and took him at Putney, with a bundle, containing these things—he said it was his property.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What day of the week was that? A. Sunday, about twelve o'clock-Barnes is three miles from Putney, by the way he went—I was running—I was very little out of breath—I did not lose sight of him—I came up to him at the Half Moon, Putney—I found the bundle in the passage—I did not take it from him—he was standing by it—he said it was his, and I should not have it—he came through Barnes a little after twelve o'clock—I am not a constable.





JOHN FRANKS
 (police-constable V 124.) I took the prisoner.





JOHN PASCOE
 (police-constable T 19.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clerk's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man who was tried and convicted.

Cross-examined. Q. When was that? A. On the 22nd September, 1834—I have known him nine years.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

MATTHEW GIBSON
 and 



RICHARD BOXALL
 were indicted for

stealing 4 tame fowls, value 10s., the goods of 



Joseph Kimpton; and that Gibson had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH KIMPTON
. I live in Sussex-place, Old Kent-road. I had four fowls—I shut them up between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 30th of Jan.—the next morning they were gone, between eight and nine o'clock—the policeman found them—he had the four which I had lost at the police-court.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Have you any doubt of them? A. Not the least.





WILLIAM MORTON
 (police-constable P 289.) About eight o'clock on the night of the 30th of Jan. I met the prisoners in the Old Kent-road—I had been in search of them for a week on another charge—I took Boxall, but did not get more than twenty yards before he got away—I took him again, and took him across the road to a cheesemonger's shop—he had a basket on his head—I threw it off his head, and my wife, who was close behind, called out, "Here are some fowls in the basket"—I told her to take care of them—Gibson was brought over to me by another officer—I handcuffed the prisoners together, and asked them where they had got the fowls—Boxall said "You would b—y well like us to tell you, should not you?"—two fowls were found in Gibson's pocket—the fowls were shown to the prosecutor—he identified them—they were just killed, and warm—the prisoners had got about 300 yards from the prosecutor's.





SARAH MORTON
. I am the wife of William Morton. I saw the basket fall off Boxall's head—it contained two of these fowls.





THOMAS CONNOR
 (police-constable M 252.) I produce a certificate of

Gibson's former conviction at Newington—(read Convicted 17th March, 1845, and confined fourteen days and whipped)—the prisoner is the person.

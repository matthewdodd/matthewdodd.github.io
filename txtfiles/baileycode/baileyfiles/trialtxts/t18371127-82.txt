WILLIAM WHITE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of November, 1 cigar box, value 1l.; and 200 cigars, value 1l. 10s.; the goods of 




John French.






MARY ANN FRENCH
. I am the wife of John French, a tobacconist, in West-street, St. Giles. On the 1st of November I had a cigar box on the

counter—I saw it at nine o'clock in the morning, and missed it five minutes after, when I came to serve in the shop—it has been found—it was stopped in the broker's shop by the broker.





GEORGE WORSTER
. I am porter to Mr. Ford. On Friday, the 3rd of November, the prisoner came and asked if I would buy the box—I took this box from the prisoner, and took it to my master, Mr. Ford, and told him I suspected it was a box that had been stolen from the corner of Lumber-court—my employer came and told the prisoner to walk with me to the next shop, Mr. Bradley's and the prisoner went with me there, and my master and Mr. Bradley had some conversation, and told the prisoner that they had some suspicion it was stolen, and he had better go and fetch the parties—he went away—I did not see him again till he was in custody on the Saturday—he is the man.





THOMAS CARTER
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, from the description given of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I do not know any thing of the robbery—they are mistaken in the person altogether, and how they came to know where I lived I do not know.

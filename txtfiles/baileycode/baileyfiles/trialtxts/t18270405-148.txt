FRANCES MACKENZIE. I am a widow. On the 28th of March, about half-past three o'clock, I was in White Lion-street


, with two of my children - my son William was carrying my bag containing 4s. 6d., a purse, and handkerchief - all on a sudden I heard him cry - I turned round, and he said a boy had taken his bag - I turned, and saw the prisoner running - I ran - a boy came up, and tried to stop me, but I ran, and called Stop thief! the prisoner was stopped without my losing sight of him - Randall gave me the bag.

            . I was in White Lion-street, and heard the alarm - I saw the prisoner throw this bag down; it was picked up, and given to Mrs. Mackenzie - I kept him in sight till he was stopped.

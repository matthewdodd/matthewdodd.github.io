for stealing, on the 
6th of January, 8lbs. of beef, the goods of 



William Withey.






WILLIAM CHICHESTER REYNOLDS
, On the night in question, in consequence of information, I went after the prisoner, and asked what the under his smock-frock he said, nothing at all; what business had I to address him in that way?—I searched him, and found this piece of beef under his smock-frock with the bacon—he made great resistance, and refused to go with me—I went to the prosecutor's shop—he identified the beef, having lost it a few minutes previously—the prisoner said he bought it at Mr. Weeks's which is next door to where the bacon we is taken from.





WILLIAM WITHEY
. I live in Bernondsey-street. I know this beef to be mine—I did not miss it till the witness brought it to me.





RICHARD SEXTON
. I am a watchman on the railway. Two persons came down the street together—one went into the shop and asked for something the other looked into the window, and whippedchipped in and took the beef and walked away with it—that was the prisoner—I saw the officer, and told him.

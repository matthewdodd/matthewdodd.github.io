 was indicted

for stealing, on the

Lucy Oakham







LUCY OAKHAM
. I am a widow, and live in World's End-passage, the prisoner is my son. On Saturday, the 16th of April, I gave the prisoner two shillings to go and pay Mr. Ho well, the baker, in Church-street, Chelsea, part of a bill, which came to 4s. 3d.—he returned in about a quarter of an hour—he brought me a small note, and made an excuse that Mr. Howell's mother was not within, and for that reason he could not bring the bill and receipt for the money—he said he had paid the money.





ALFRED HOWELL
, The prosecutrix deals with me. The prisoner did not come on the 16th of April and pay me 2s.—he has not paid me any money for his mother in April—his mother generally comes herself—I am confident he did not pay the 2s.




GUILTY
.** Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

The prisoner was my servant—she was to leave on Saturday, 7th Oct., and I heard my sister request her to bring down her boxes to have them examined—she refused—I called the beadle from the Arcade—the prisoner was asked for the key of her room—she said she had not got it. she thought it was below, and she searched, and could not find it—we forced the door—her boxes were there—they were locked—the beadle broke them open in her presence, found these two gold brooches, this silver pencil-case, and other things, my property—I gave her in charge.

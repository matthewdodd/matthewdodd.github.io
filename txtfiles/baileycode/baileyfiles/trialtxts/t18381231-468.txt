CHARLES HENRY COOPER
. I live with Mr. Henry Worms, a boot and shoemaker, in Shoreditch. On the 19th of December I saw a pair of half-boots at the side of the door post, about twenty minutes past four o'clock—I brought the other things in and left them on the door-post—I twisted the string round the nail—when the door was shut they would be inside—I did not miss them till about six o'clock the same evening, when the policeman brought them—(produced)—these are them.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I was on duty in Kingsland-road, about four o'clock in the evening, on the 19th of December, and saw the prisoners in company—I followed them for an hour and a half, when I met with a constable, and we stopped them—I found this pair of half-boots stuffed into Webb's breast—I asked where they got them from—Lewis said they came a long way from there—Lewis afterwards said they came from Shoreditch—I went down there and found the prosecutor—the prisoners both said they were guilty.

WEBB*—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—Both 



Transported for Seven Years.

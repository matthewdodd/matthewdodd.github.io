GEORGE LECOCG. I live in Throgmorton-street


. On the 1st of April, in the morning, I missed seven handkerchiefs from a chest of drawers in the attic; the prisoner had no business in the house; the garret window is often left open. I found them at the Mansion House.

            . I am servant to Mrs. Marriott, of Old Broad-street. I found the prisoner in her bed-room on the 31st of March, at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - he was a stranger, and must have come in at the top of the house - he could go along the roofs from the prosecutor's to our house. I laid hold of him - he said he was after a pigeon which had flown over the house. These seven handkerchiefs were found on him.

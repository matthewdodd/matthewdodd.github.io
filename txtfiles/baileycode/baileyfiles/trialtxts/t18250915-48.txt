            , Esq

CHARLES DUNDAS, ESQ. I live at the Manor-house, King's-road, Chelsea


. My servant, 
               
                  Charlotte 
                  Stephenson
               



             had the care of my house while I was in the country. I was out of town on the 28th of July - since then I have seen some articles which are mine. I had missed some of them in March last.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not Charlotte Stephenson been with you some time? A. Yes, about nine years, and I believe was honest in my service. I have no knowledge of any of her family.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
CHARLOTTE STEPHENSON. I am in Mr. Dundas's service, and had the care of his house. The two prisoners are my brothers - they sometimes slept in the house; I cannot tell where they slept on the night of the 27th of July. On missing some articles I accused William of having taken them; he confessed that he had, and gave me the duplicates.
Cross-examined. Q. Had George often slept in the house? A. No, only one week previous to my missing the property - he had not slept there in March. George has had a good character - he has been in the poultry business.

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker, and live in Queen's-row. I produce two table-cloths and two silver buckles - I believe one of the table-cloths was pawned by the prisoner George. I did not take in the other.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Eaton-street, Pimlico. I have a waistcoat and three flat-irons, which were pawned by William - the waistcoat on the 23d of October, and the irons the 3d of November.

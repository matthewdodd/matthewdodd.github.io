CHARLES SAUNDERS PITT
. I live in Addle-street, Aldermanbury. I was walking in Cheapside with my brother on the 12th of January between six and seven o'clock—I happened to look over my shoulder and saw the prisoner draw my brother's handkerchief out of his pocket—I immediately left hold of my brother, and collared the prisoner—he dropped the handkerchief—my brother picked it up.

Prisoner. I was about twelve yards from the gentleman when he collared me, and said I had drawn the handkerchief—I staid there about six minutes—he came and took of the handkerchief, and said, "Does anybody own this handkerchief?"





JAMES PITT
. I live in Brunswick-crescent, Camberwell. I was walking with my brother in Cheapside, on the 13th of January, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I saw him drop it—this is the handkerchief.

Prisoner. I am quite innocent—he did not see the handkerchief in my hand—he came and picked it up.

Witness. I saw him with it in his hand, and saw him drop it.

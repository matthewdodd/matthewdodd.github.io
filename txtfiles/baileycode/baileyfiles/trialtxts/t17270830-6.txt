 last.


                  Ann 
                  Bruce 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner was their Servant
, and had taken the Goods privately and gone away with them; and the Sunday following they took her with the Gown upon her Back. She had nothing to say in her Defence, but that she was drunk, and knew not what she did; for which in all likelihood she must go to a Place where they'll keep her sober this seven Years; for the Fact being plain the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

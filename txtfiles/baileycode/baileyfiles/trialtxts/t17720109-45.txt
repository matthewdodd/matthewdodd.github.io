            . On the 4th of January I saw the prisoner come out of the buildings, about a quarter after 12 o'clock, when the men were gone to drink, I saw something under his arm; I asked him what he had got, and stopped him; he called me an old son of a bitch, and said he would knock me down; a young man came and took the saws from him.
(The saws produced and deposed to.)

I never spoke to this man, and I never had the saws.

WILLIAM HEWLETT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of March, 1 pair of half-boots, value 3s., the goods of 



Samuel Woolstone.






SAMUEL WOOLSTONE
. I live in High-street, St. Giles's and am a cordwainer—I lost this pair of half-boots, on the 13th of March, about half-past seven o'clock, or between seven and wight o'clock—they were hanging just inside the door-post—I had not told them.





PETER YOUNGMAN
. About five minutes before seven o'clock in the evening. 1 was in High-street, St. Giles's—I saw the prisoner steal from the shop of Mr. Woolstone a pair of half-boots—he ran from the shop—I directly pursued and caught him—he ran and tried to make his escape—I saw him drop one when the officer took him—I did not see him drop the other, but I heard it fall—the officer picked up one, and I believe some one else picked up one.





HENRY CURTIS
 (police-constable F 156.) I saw the prisoner running, and just as the man caught him, I saw him drop one boot—I picked up this, and a person just by me gave me the other.

Prisoner. I took from distress—my father would not give me a farthing.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 19th of October, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner take this stuff out of the shop, from the door; I immediately pursued, and caught her with it, wrapped in her apron, about six yards off. Two women tried to hinder me from following her - it hung inside the shop.

            . I am an officer. I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw a crowd at the corner of Old Bethlem. I heard several voices say,
"Let her go." I made through the crowd, and took the prisoner into custody with the stuff.

RATCLIFF LUZMORE. I am a bootmaker
, and live in Great Tower-street


 - I am in partnership with 
               
                  James 
                  Anderson
               



            . On the 21st of May, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was at work at the back of the shop, turned round and saw the prisoner taking a pair of boots off the seat. I followed him down Harp-lane, and called to a person to stop him, which he did; I saw him drop the boots, and gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

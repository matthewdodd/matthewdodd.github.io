, where the Goods before-mentioned, and a Person who personated the Thief were produc'd. Mr. Sunderland depos'd That as near as he can remember, the 30th of June, 
               
                  John 
                  Hornby 
               



             and 
               
                  George 
                  Beal 
               



             being at the Prosecutor's House, he and Mrs. Hatchet went with them in a Coach to a Tavern in Clare-Market, he thinks the Sun Tavern, upon their Promise for the Reward of 6 Guineas, to produce the Goods mentioned, and the Person who stole them. That when they came to the Tavern, they inquir'd for the Thief, and Hornby and Beal went from the Tavern, while Mrs. Hatchet and he staid there, to fetch him, and that in about an Hour and half they came back, and said, That he was in the House, but they did not bring him up with them into the Room; but when Hornby and Beal came in, 
               
                  Edward 
                  Wootton 
               



             came in with them, and that both Beal and Wootton insisted upon having Releases drawn, and Hornby upon their paying the 6 Guineas, the Reward; that Wootton went out, and fetch'd the Releases, and a Scrivener. That they, Mrs. Hatchet and Sunderland, demanding the Goods, and Person who stole them, before they paid the Money, 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



             was brought into the Room, in a large black Coat, big enough to hold 2 or 3 of him, he being but a slender Man, and a very large Hat on his Head. That this Charles, Motherby took upon himself to be the Thief, and produc'd the Bag wherein the Things had been stolen, and 19 Rings, 2 Gold Chains, and a Silver Watch. That these Things being produc'd, the 6 Guineas were laid down upon the Table, and taken up by 
               
                  John

            : And that asking Motherby, who produc'd the Goods, and took upon him to be the Thief, his Name and Occupation, Motherby told him his Name was 
               
                  Peter 
                  Roberts 
               



            , and that he was a Sawyer in Westminster, That he suspecting he had not told him true, bid Motherby let him see his Hand; which when he had seen, he told Motherby he was not the Person he pretended to be, for he (Mr. Sunderland) himself being a Sawyer, was well satisfy'd he was not a Person of that Business, but some Taylor, Barber, or Garreteer. That his Suspicion belong confirm'd by Mrs. Hatchet, who had seen the Person who stole the Goods, and knew him to be a Man very different in Person from 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



            , he talk'd sharply to him, threatning him, that if he did not confess the Truth he should be sent to Newgate. That then Mothorby begg'd for Favour, and said he was a Perriwig-maker in Golden Lane, and that the Person who stole the Goods was one 
               
                  John 
                  Dawes 
               



            , a Sawyer. 
               
                  Philip 
                  Roher 
               



             depos'd, That 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



             came to him the latter End of June, the Day he did not well remember, but thought it might be the 26th, and brought a Gold Watch, 3 Gold Rings, and 2 Diamond Rings, desiring him to tell him the Value of them; that he did value the Gold Rings, and a Friend of his, a Jeweller, coming in, did value the Diamond Rings, at 13 s. the one, and 30 s. the other, as he thinks; that himself not pretending to Skill in Watches, it was left with him to get it valued; that the next Morning an Advertisement publish'd by the Goldsmith's Company was brought to him, wherein be found the Gold Watch described, and that thereupon he carried the Watch to Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Hatchet. Other Evidences depos'd. That 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



             was a Lodger in the House of 
               
                  John 
                  Dawes 
               



            , the Sawyer, who was the Person said to have stolen the Goods, and that 
               
                  Edward 
                  Wootton 
               



             was Brother to the Wife of the said John Dawes. The Prisoners Defence consisted chiefly in Three Things. First, In supporting their Reputation. Secondly, in charging the Prosecutor with a Design of extorting Money from them. And thirdly, In endeavouring to show that they had conform'd themselves to the Statute in that Case made and provided. Wootton and Beal call'd a great many, who gave them a good Character, both as to their Industry in their Callings, Wootton being a Frame-maker, and Beal a Carver; and Motherby also call'd 3 or 4 who gave him a good Character. And to prove the Prosecutor would have extorted Money from them, they call'd 
               
                  Robert 
                  Ward 
               



            , 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Ward 
               



            , and a Brother of Wootton's, who depos'd, That Mrs. Hatchet would have compounded the Matter for 15 l. But their Evidence being attended with some seeming Improbabilities, and being deny'd by the Prosecutor, it gain'd but little Credit. The Third Part of their Defence related chiefly to Wootton, Beal, and Hornby, who seem'd to infer, That they had comply'd with the Statute, in that they had apprehended 
               
                  Charles 
                  Motherby 
               



            , whom they said they took to be the Thief, and was all the Thief they knew; urging that they had been at a great Expence in apprehending and fetching him 60 or 70 Miles out of the Country. In answer to this the Statute was ordered to be read to them in Court, for their Satisfaction how well they had conform'd themselves to it, and was read accordingly. Upon a full Hearing of the Matter the Jury found them 

               all Guilty of the Indictment
            .

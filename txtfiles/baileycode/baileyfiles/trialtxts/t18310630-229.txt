            . I am a machine-maker
, and live in Denmark-street, St. Giles'


. These tools were in my warehouse - the prisoner and his father rented a shop on the same premises about three years ago; I have heard nothing of them since.
THOMAS MADDEN. I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's front door, with the vice in his hand - I let him go along, thinking he belonged to the shop, but he went into Rose-street, put it into the stable-yard to conceal it, and then came away; I saw Kelly find it in that place.
JOHN KELLY. I am a gun-maker, and occupy a shop over the prosecutor's. I found these tools in the stableyard.

            . These tools are mine, and were safe on my premises the night before - the prisoner had no right there; he must have got in at the front door - nothing was broken; I fastened the back shop with some pieces of wood, which were removed, and the door open -I got up at five o'clock, as Kelly alarmed me; I found the prisoner in Rose-street - two latch-keys were found in his pocket; they would not open my door - I cannot tell how he got in; the centre-bit and other things were found on him.
Prisoner's Defence. I was not in Denmark-street that morning.

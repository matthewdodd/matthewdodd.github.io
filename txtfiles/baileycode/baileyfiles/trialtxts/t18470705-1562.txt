THOMAS CONNER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of Charles Orchard Dayman, Esq., from his person.






CHARLES ORCHAND DAYMAN
, Esq. I am barrister. On the 21st of June I was walking down Holborn with a friend—I found I had lost my handkerchief—I went back, in consequence of information from a policeman—we crossed over the street, near Ely-place—in the middle of the street the policeman left me, sprang forward, and when I got up to him, he had hold of the prisoner, with my handkerchief in his hand—it was the one I had, lost—this produced is it—there is a mark on it.





JOSEPH DALTON
 (City police-constable, No. 366.) I was on Holborn-hill about half-past nine o'clock, watching the prisoner and two more—I knew him—I saw two gentlemen coming down Holborn—I distinctly saw the prisoner go up and take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's right hand pocket—I passed by him for a moment, and told Mr. Dayman to come back with me—I saw the prisoner in the road, and took him into custody—he flung the handkerchief down on the pavement—this is it.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me fling it down? A. Yes, and saw you take it from the prosecutor's pocket—I passed you about half a minute, and then saw you come out of Shoe-lane on to Holborn-hill—you picked the gentleman's pocket near Shoe-lane—you went a little way up Shoe-lane and turned back again.

Prisoner. I have worked six years for Mr. Cubitt, of Gray's Inn-road, and was never locked up.




GUILTY. † Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM MONTRION. I was walking near St. Giles' church


 on the 6th of April, and felt a snatch at my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner walking from me; I followed, and charged him with taking my handkerchief - I seized him, threw his coat open, and saw my handkerchief in his inside pocket; he said he found it, but I had had it just before.
Prisoner. Q. How far was I from you? A. Five or six yards, walking the contrary way; my pocket was turned out, and he was walking on.

Prisoner's Defence. He touched me on the shoulder, and asked if I had found a handkerchief; I pulled out this, and asked if it was his. Mr. Raffle, of Long-alley, is my master.

            . I lye in a low Room in Rosemary-lane



; when I went to Bed I left my Doors all fast, but about Two in the Morning the Watch call'd me up, and told me they were open. I got up. My Goods and Money were taken off the Bed where I lay. A little Boy (

            ) afterwards inform'd me who did it. I ask'd him if he did not see me a-bed? and he answer'd, No; but I felt you, and we had taken more, but we were frighted by Somebody's calling up a Midwife next Door, and so we ran away with what we had got.
Will. Newell. Between One and Two in the Morning I met the Prisoner in Rosemary-lane, and he told me he knew a House where we could get in; and so he listed me over the Spikes into the Yard, and I struck back the Lock of the Yard Door and let him in. The Kitchen Window was broke, and a Paper stuck over it, which I tore, and so struck back the Lock of that Door too, and then we both went in and took the Things, and sold them to 
               
                  Rachel

            . The Prisoner and Newell brought the Things over the Water for me to sell, but they could not find me then; and afterwards I met them at play together, and then they told me they had carried them to

J. Mackey. As my Mate and I were asleep in my Cabbin we were surprized by a Light. I started up and saw the Prisoner. Aba! says I, are you there? He jump'd half out of the Cabin Window, but we catch'd him by the Legs and haul'd him in again. A Wherry lay at the Ship's Stern to put the Things in. We found a Dark Lanthorn and a Penknife upon him.

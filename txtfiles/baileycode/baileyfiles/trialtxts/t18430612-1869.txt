CHARLOTTE GRIFFIN
. I am single, and live in New-way, Westminster About one o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 22nd of May, I met the prisoner—he asked if I had a room of my own—I said, "Yes"—he asked me to take him home—I did—he asked me to fetch a pot of beer, and while I gone he took these things, and he was gone—these are my things—I am an unfortunate woman—he gave me 4d. to get a pot of beer, and I could not get it.

Prisoner. She was gone an hour and a half. I took these things and went to look for her, to get my money back, and she to have the things.





GEORGE BANHAM
 (police-constable B 84.) At half-past one o'clock I stopped the prisoner in Great Chapel-street, about ten; minutes' walk from the prosecutrix's, with these things wrapped up in a gown, except a pair of sheets, which were wrapped round his body—he had no coat or hat on—the looking glass was in his pocket—I asked where he got them—he said he had a row with his wife, and took the blanket to go and lay down with a comrade—at the station he said, "I will tell you the truth; I have been home with a girl; I gave her the money to go for beer; she has done me, and I thought I would do her"—I found 7d. on him.
(David Worsfall, a serjeant in the 1st regiment of Guards, to which the prisoner belonged, gave him a good character.)




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

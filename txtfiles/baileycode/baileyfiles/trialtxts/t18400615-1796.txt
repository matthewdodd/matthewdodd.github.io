1796. 




ALEXANDER LAWSON
was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. the goods of 



Henry Whittaker, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY WHITTAKER
. I live in Manor-street, Clapham. In the after noon of the 19th of May, I was in Gravel-lane, Southwark, about half-past three o'clock—there was a fire—some persons were standing there, but I was passing on my business—I felt some one at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner in the act of dropping my handkerchief from his hand—he was close to my back—I took him into custody—he said it was not him, but I saw him drop it—this is my handkerchief which is now produced.

Prisoner. I said I was not the person—and there were persons there who said, " You have got your property, let him go." Witness. There were three women who said it was not him, and those women followed him down to the office each day he went there.

Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I made application to respectable persons in the crowd, who said I was not the person.






ROBERT MALIN
(police-constable M159.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace's office in Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person, who was tried by the name of Alexander John Roy.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Fourteen Years

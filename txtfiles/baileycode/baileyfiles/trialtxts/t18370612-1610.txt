MR. PHILLIPS

ORLANDO WEBB
. I am a solicitor, and live in Upper Stamford-street. I went over London Bridge, at a quarter before four o'clock, on the 17th of May—just before I came to the centre of the bridge I felt some one pull my coat—I turned, put my hand on my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I looked and saw the prisoner and a companion of his behind me—the companion went away, and I saw the prisoner had something up his back—I said, "Now give me my handkerchief—he put his hand up his back and gave it to me—I gave it to the officer—this it my handkerchief.





FRANCIS MACDONALD
 (police-constable M 184.) I took the prisoner into custody, by desire of Mr. Webb—he gave me this handkerchief.

Prisoner. The gentleman took the handkerchief away that night, and brought it in the morning again.





ORLANDO WEBB

re-examined. I kept it till I went to the officer the next day, and then gave it to the officer—it is the same handkerchief—I had not parted with it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to meet a friend, and saw two boys going behind the gentleman, they dropped the handkerchief. I took it up, and was putting it into my pocket, when he took me—I know nothing of the boys or the men either—I have travelled about the country as a broom-hawker.

MR. WEBB
re-examined. There was one boy with him—he turned backand went over to the Borough—I turned instantly when I felt the pull at my pocket—there was no one near enough to take it, but the prisoner or his companion.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

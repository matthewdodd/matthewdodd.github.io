I gave them the horse; the mens names are Smith and Fenn; I gave them the horse, and they went about their business; and about ten minutes before ten the same morning, I saw them again, they came up the yard with a horse and cart; they had me to take care of the horse.
Q. Was there any thing in the cart - A. Yes, two bales, something tied round with cord, and a box. I put the horse into the stable, the horse sweated very much; they tilted the shafts of the cart up in an open coach house, nobody could then see what was in the cart.

            . I had the care of a house belonging to Robert Seals; the prisoner occupied a room in that house, and paid 7d. a night for it; on the 7th of January she spoke to my wife, and went out: when I came home I went into the room, and missed these articles - I went and found the prisoner, who told me she had sold the saucepan to a woman in Essex-street, for 8d. - I went to that woman, who gave up the saucepan, and she swore at Lambeth-street office that the prisoner sold it to her; I have not found any thing else. When I took the prisoner she said, if I would make no piece of work she would pay me for the things on Saturday night - she said she had had a drop of beer, and sold the bed and blanket, but could not tell where.
ROBERT SEALS. Thawley had the care of the house for me; I have been ill some time: he brought the prisoner to my room; she went on her knees, and said she would pay for the things.
Prisoner's Defence. The place is open front and back - when I came out I saw several persons on the stairs; it is in Catherine Wheel-alley


, a very low neighbourhood; this man wants to extort money from me, thinking my sister is in good circumstances; my husband went into the country on the Monday before this happened. There was no blanket in the room - it was only two horse-cloths, and the whole of the things were not worth 3s.

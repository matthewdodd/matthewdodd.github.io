            . I am a tailor
, and live in Barbican


. The prisoner was brought into my house, charged with stealing a coat; he had an apron on, and I found in it this coat which had hung inside the shop: he said nothing.

            . I live in Sun-court, Golden-lane. I saw another boy give the prisoner the coat; he put it under his apron; I did not see where it was taken from, they were at the next door to Jacobs - the other was nearest to the shop, but they were close together; I took him into the shop, and saw the coat found on him.

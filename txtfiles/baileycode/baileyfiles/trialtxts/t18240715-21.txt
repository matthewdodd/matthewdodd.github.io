            . I belong to the Ordnance-office
. On the 5th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Wardour-street


; my handkerchief was in my right hand coat pocket. I stood to let two persons pass, and felt a touch at my pocket, turned round, and seeing the prisoner near me I charged him with it - he denied it, but afterwards produced my handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

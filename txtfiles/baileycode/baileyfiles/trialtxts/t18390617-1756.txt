1756. 




HENRY M'KEAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of May, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



George Howse, from his person.






GEORGE HOWSE
. On the 3rd of May I was in the Bridge-road, Vauxhall, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—two boys walked behind me a considerable time, which I was not aware of, making several attempts to extricate my handkerchief—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned, and saw a boy, ten or twelve yards from me, throw the handkerchief on the ground, and run away—there were two boys together—I cannot say if the prisoner is one—this is my handkerchief.





NATHANIEL HARRIS
. I was near the spot, about three o'clock, or a little after—I was passing up Vauxhall Bridge-road, I saw two boys behind the prosecutor, and, as I thought, they were playing some sort of lark—but on looking more particularly, I thought it was not likely that this gentleman should be an acquaintance of theirs—they turned and saw me, and desisted—they went again—two other boys came and said those two boys were thieves—I then crossed the way, and after they got fifty yards the prisoner made two or three attempts to get the handkerchief, and could not—the prosecutor then turned by a dead wall, and then the other boy got it out—I went to seize him, but I fell—I am sure the prisoner had attempted to do it—he did not do it, but the other did, and he was in company with him.





JOHN WIGGINS
. On the 3rd of May I saw this boy run away—I followed, took him, and gave him in charge.

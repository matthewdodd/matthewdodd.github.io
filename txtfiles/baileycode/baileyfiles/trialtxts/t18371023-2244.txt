JOHN MURPHY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Samuel Whitfield Daukes, from his person.






SAMUEL WHITFIELD DAUKES
. On the 9th of October, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was walking in High-street, Camden-town—the prisoner met me and passed me, and immediately afterwards, as a stage was passing by us, a gentleman outside said, "Sir, that man has picked your pocket," pointing to the prisoner—I pursued—he ran off I gave an alarm, and ran as fast as I could—a butcher sprang out, he ran against him and returned—my handkerchief was taken up and shown to me—this is it—(looking at it.)





HENRY BUNGEY
. I was standing at my own door, in Pratt-street, and heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I secured him, and he dropped the handkerchief at his side.





JESSE SHOPLAND
 (police-constable S 44.) I was on duty in High-street, and saw a mob assembled—I went up, and the gentleman gave the prisoner into my charge, and a pork-butcher gave me the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. On the day in question I was going to see my brother, who is a bird-catcher, on Hampstead Heath—I saw the handkerchief lying on the ground—I took it up, and asked a little boy, who was standing near him, who it belonged to—he said, "The gentleman across the way"—the man came across and took hold of me, he shook me, and said I had stolen it—a man named Greenwood had met me about five minutes before, down by the toll-gate, walking towards Hampstead.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Justice Bosanquet.

GEORGE TURNER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of January, 1 shirt, value 3s., the goods of 



George Henry Dowdeswell.






MARY DOWDESWELL
. I live with my father, George Henry Dowdeswell, a confectioner, at Hoxton. On the 4th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, a policeman came to me with the prisoner, and, in consequence of what he said, I looked, and missed a shirt, which I had seen safe twenty minutes before, hanging inside the shop, about two yards from the door—this is it—(looking at it.)





GEORGE KEMP
. I am a policeman. On the 4th of January I saw the prisoner and two others, and followed them for about two hours—they went into the prosecutor's shop, and came out again—they came back in about half an hour—the prisoner went in, and took this shirt—I took him with it, and took him to the station-house.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

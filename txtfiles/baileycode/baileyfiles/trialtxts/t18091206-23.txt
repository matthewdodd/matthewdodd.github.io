            . I live at No. 115, Maid-lane, in the Borough; at present I am out of place.
Q. Where were you on the 27th of November last - A. I left my place on the Monday, I do not know what day of the month it was; I left my place between four and five, I took my lodgings that very evening in Maid lane in the Borough; I had lived at the City coffee house, Mr. Readers, a twelve month.
Q. When you left Mr. Readers, you received your wages - A. Yes; I received seven pound eleven shillings and two-pence; I went to the doctor's to pay my bill, in Queen-street, between six and seven; I went to pay the chandler shop woman and the washer, woman what I owed; we got talking, it was near ten o'clock when I came away. They told me at my lodgings if I was not home at ten o'clock I could not be let in; I intended to go to Long Acre to Mrs. Haggerston's, the George, to try to get a bed; on my going there, on the other side of Temple bar, I met with the prisoner, she was going as if to Covent Garden; I said to her, young woman, will you be so good as to tell me of a lodging. I dare say when I met her it was half after eleven o'clock.
Q. Where had you been from ten o'clock at the time you left your washerwoman till half after eleven o'clock - A. I had been no where, but kept straight on from Little St. Thomas the Apostle, where my washerwoman lived. I told the prisoner I would give her any thing if she would take me to a good house, as I was a stranger; she took me up a court, and when I came up to a public house she asked me to give her something to drink; I gave her a glass of rum, and after that she said she was damnably hungry; I said I was going to have a pint of porter and some bread and cheese, she was welcome to have part; she did take part of it; after that she took me to Ship-yard, to the Old Rose hotel; I asked the landlady if I could have a bed; she said yes, and took me up stairs to see the room; the prisoner said she would go up with me, she would be a protection for me; the landlady took me into the room; I asked her what it was for the bed, she replied three shillings; I gave her a dollar and she gave me two shillings; the prisoner said she would stop with me if it was agreeable, she was destitute of a bed; I said to her, as you are a servant like myself I have no objection, if you are quite clean you shall sleep with me; she said she was quite clean. I gave consent for her to sleep with me. In the course of conversation, as we were sitting down, I said I do not think you are a servant; she said, what do you think I am; I said I did not know; then she told me that she was an unfortunate woman; I said cannot you reform and become a servant, it is better than going in the streets; she replied, thank God, I have found a friend at last, and she burst out a crying. I set for some time, and then said, there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety nine just persons; I told her I was no scholar, I had heard so. Before I went to bed I counted my money, I had a two pound bank note, and two shillings in silver, and six pennyworth of halfpence, a pocket handkerchief, a snuff box, and two bills that I had been and paid; I put it into my pocket; the prisoner was present; she saw my note on the table, and the two shillings in my hands; in about two minutes afterward she said, my dear, you seem fatigued, you had better go to bed; I undressed myself and went to bed; I left my pockets all of a lump with my clothes on the chair by the side of the bed. I said, before I got into bed, which side will you sleep on; she said, you sleep on the further side, next the wall.
Q. I suppose that was on the other side to where the chair was - A. Yes. We had a candle on the hob in the fire place, close to the chair; I went into bed; I sat up on the bed; she was sitting in the room; I heard the pockets chink.
Q. Where the curtains drawn - A. Yes, almost close together. When I heard the pocket chink I put the curtains of oneside, I saw her hand in my pocket; I saw the prisoner take the note out in her hand; I said you have robbed me, you have got the note out of my pocket; I told her if she would give me the note I would make no disturbance in the house; she said, blast you, search me; she took her cap and shook her hair about; I said I did not understand searching her; I said do not think that I am afraid of you, for I will go down to the landlady directly; I run down with my garment on and fetched her up stairs; I told her the woman up stairs had robbed me.
Q. Is the landlady here - A. No. They said at Bow-street they did not want any body. The landlady told Collins she had got my money; she denied it; she told them to search her; the landlady searched the bed and every where and could not find it.
Q. Did the landlady search her person - A. She did not, and I was afraid to touch her for fear she should give me a thumping; I said I would have the watchman in if she did not give me the note; the watchman came up stairs, he said now my good woman, give this girl her note; Collins said to the watchman, search me.
Q. Did the watchman search her - A. He did not; I told him to search her, the landlady said I had not the modesty of a woman; to tell him to search her; I told the watchman to keep her safe till I got my clothes on, I would follow him, and at the watchhouse I told them to take charge of her; they wanted to turn her out and me; I told her if they did turn her out it should be the worse for them; they then took her into a back room and told me they searched her, they could not find any thing upon her. I did not see her searched, I went back to the room and searched, and found nothing there. I took the prisoner before the magistrate the next day, and told him the same thing that I do now. At the office she said she would give me a pound note, and make up the rest when she could, if I would not prosecute her.
Q.Young woman, you said you left Mr. Reader, whom you had lived with a twelvemonth - A. Yes; I was a house maid; my mistress died while I was there.
Q. Now you say you had been to the washerwoman and to the chandler's shop had you drank any thing with them - A. No; I had not tasted any thing but at my dinner at Mr. Reader's, except my tea, until I met with the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. It was about half past eleven o'clock on Tuesday night when this woman overtook me between Temple bar and Chancery-lane, she tapped me on the shoulder, she said, it is a cold night, will youhave something to drink, I feel for your situation; I said thanky, ma'am; she said, can you inform me where I can get a lodging; I said I cannot get you a place but at a house that receives company; she said she did not mind what place it was, if she could get clean sheets; she said would not I have some refreshment first; she took me up a place to a public house, I said I would have a glass of gin; she said no, I should have a glass of rum; she heard a parcel of men singing in the tap-room, she said that it was a long while ago that she heard singing; she had a pot of beer warmed it, and put some ginger in it; I drank none of it. She asked me if I could smoke, I said no; we left there; she paid for the liquor and the bread and cheese. We went to the Old Rose; when we got up, stairs she told me she would get me a character if I would reform; I said I must go, she told me it was rather late then, it was near one o'clock in the morning, there was nobody about; I should get no good; it was rather cold, I got into bed, then she asked for her pockets. I gave them to her, then she said I had robbed her of a two pound note; I said, you are wellcome to search me; she went to the door and called the landlady up, she and the landlady searched me, then she sent for the watchman. I was sent to Clare-market-watchhouse and searched; they were going to turn me out, they saw she was intoxicated. She swore that she saw me take it out of her pocket.
Q. to prosecutrix. She says that you drank this pot of beer - A It was only a pint; I had no ginger in it; it was only warmed by the fire; and fourpenny worth of bread and cheese.
Q.She says that when the landlady came up she and you searched her - A. She never was searched, her stockings were never taken off.
Q.Who keeps the Rose tavern - A. I do not know; I never was there before.

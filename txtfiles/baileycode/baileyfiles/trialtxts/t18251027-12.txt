MR. JOHN WAITHMAN. I live in Fleet-street. On Sunday, the 2d of October, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking down Fleet-street


, and thought I felt something at my pocket, I turned round, and observed the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand. I collared him, and took him as far as my own house, and gave him in charge; he begged hard for mercy, and said he would never do such a thing again.

            . I am an officer. Mr. Waithman delivered the prisoner into my charge; he said he hoped Mr. Waithman would forgive him. I have kept the handkerchief ever since.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Fleet-street. The gentleman turned round, and the handkerchief dropped out of his pocket; I picked it up, and he collared me, and said I had picked his pocket; I begged for mercy, not being guilty of any such thing.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.

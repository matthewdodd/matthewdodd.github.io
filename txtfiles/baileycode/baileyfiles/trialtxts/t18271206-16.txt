                  , which had been lately before stolen by an evil disposed person, he well knowing the same to have been stolen
            .
RICHARD PECK. I live at Old Ford. On the 18th of July I went into the Jolly Sailors public-house, Back-street, Shadwell, leaving my gelding in charge of Watson; I came out in about five minutes, in consequence of an alarm; the horse and Watson were gone; I went in search, but could not find it; on the 19th of October I found it in possession of Mr. Barber, the Governor of Gosport gaol - it was a bay gelding, worth thirty-five guineas; I lost the saddle and harness with it.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BARBER
               



            . I am Governor of Gosport Bridewell. On the 17th of October, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's premises at Brockhurst, in the parish of Alverstoke; I knew him by the name of William Brown, but not by the name of Cutts - he is a horse-dealer
; I went to his stables between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning; I saw several horses there; I inquired for the prisoner; I think he was not up when I first got there; he came to me in a short time; I told him I wanted to speak to him, and asked him where the little bay horse was; he said it was in the stall of the stable; I told him I had seen it already, and it was so much improved, I scarcely know it; I had seen it in his possession a fortnight before; the prisoner had shown it to me for a friend of mine, who wanted one; I do not recollect whether he made any reply to my observation;I then said, "Mr. Brown, you are wanted, and the little bay horse;" he then said, "Oh, Mr. Barber, I am in trouble - I have long been wishing to see you; I am sorry I ever acknowledged that lad (or boy), to be my brother;" he knew me before; I do not recollect that he called the boy by any name, but I knew who he meant; I said, I must take him into custody, and the horse; he said he was willing to go with me; he asked my permission to go up stairs to shift himself - he had his slippers on, and his night-shirt; he called to his father to bring his boots; I allowed him to go up stairs; I remained in the parlour; I left my son in the room, and went to the stable; I called Stroud, the constable, whom I had taken with me, but he had not made his appearance; I found Stroud, and returned to the parlour; I had not been absent above two or three minutes; I showed Stroud the horse in the stable, and before we got back to the parlour, in consequence of what Stroud said, I looked at the corner of a building, adjacent to the stable, and caught a glimpse of a man in a dark coat; I returned to the parlour - the prisoner was not there, nor in the house; I procceded towards some fields, in the direction I had caught the glimpse of the man; I looked about for nearly an hour, and then found the prisoner at the Sun public-house, at Brockhurst, about half a mile from his premises, in the custody of a constable; I took him to the Bridewell, with the gelding, and showed it to Mr. Peck on the following day.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You have been Governor of the Bridewell a considerable time? A. Yes; I had known the prisoner two or three months - he knew I was Governor of the Bridewell - he had shown me the horse about three weeks before - it was not then in so good a condition; when I saw it afterwards it had been well attended to.
Q. It had not been cut in the mane or tail? A. Yes, I am sure it had - the hair of the tail had been cut and combed - it was a switch tail when I first saw it; being cut made a very great alteration in its appearance; I do not mean to say that the fleshy part of the tail was cut - it was a cob tail; I saw several persons at the stable.
Q. Was it not a stable in which any body might put a horse? A. No; he made no secret of showing me the horse; I was frequently there, and had seen it two or three times.
Q. Did not you see different persons about the stable? A. Yes, Mr. Brown's attendants; the horse had been brought to my house with another or two, to be shown to a friend of mine - my son rode it about, and was so delighted with it, that Brown, in conversation, called it my son's horse. My house is nearly two miles from his stable - it joins Gosport gaol.
Q. He said, "Oh, Mr. Brown, I am in trouble" - did he not add, "It is a pity such a thing should have been left with me?" A. I do not recollect it - I wish to mention all he said; I will not say he did not, for he said a great deal to me.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is his stable from Old Ford? A. About eighty miles; I had no information about it when my son rode it.


                  JOHN 
                  STROUD
               



            . I am constable of Gosport. I accompanied Mr. Barber to the prisoner's premises; I was in the road close by the yard - Mr. Barber came out to me in about five minutes, and showed me a bay a horse; I had seen the prisoner go into the house with Mr. Barber, and as I stood at the stable door I saw him make his escape across the yard into the field; I told Mr. Barber, and followed him across three fields; he was running without a hat; I called a man named Fryer to assist me, and about three fields off we came up to him; I stood, and saw Fryer bring him from a hedge; he had slippers on, and no hat - he took me by the arm, and said, "I am beat - I will go with you like a man, Stroud."
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see him show the horse to Barber? A. I saw him go to the stable with him; I went into the stable afterwards; I had seen young Mr. Barber trying the horse at Bridewell, about eleven o'clock one day; a great many people were there; I never saw it before.
RICHARD PECK. I received the horse from Barber - it is the one I lost at the time in question; I got it from Barber's stable.
Cross-examined. Q. Had you a doubt of its being yours the moment you saw it? A. No; I knew it directly - it was not fatter than when I lost it; the tail had been trimmed; it was cut - it had been cut previous to my losing it, but it had grown long again; when I found it it had been cut shorter than I had ever seen it before; no joints were taken off.
Prisoner's Defence. Dean is the man who brought the horse to my place, which I believe Mr. Blunden knows - he came to my house on the 29th of July, with a horse, and I gave information of it to his father, and he sent to tell me to take care of the horse and his son, for he had a friend arranging the matter with Mr. Peck, which was the cause I kept the horse; I never offered to sell it. I took a cob down to show a friend of Mr. Barber's, and I rode this gelding myself; I never intended to sell the gelding. I never showed it for sale to any individual - it was seen publicly in plenty of places.

            . I am a farmer, and live close by the prisoner. I have seen Dean about the prisoner's premises - I do not know whether he brought the horse there.

            . I am a stable-keeper
, and live in Bury-street, Bloomsbury. On Sunday evening, the 2d of April, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the corner of Hyde-street


, and saw the prisoner come by, alone, he immediately turned round and caught hold of my watch-chain - I held it as fast as I could - he broke the ring, got the seal, and ran off. I pursued, calling Stop thief, and he ran into the hands of Furzeman, who secured him. I am confident he is the man. The seal was found on the ground.

            . I am a constable. I was in Holborn, and heard the cry of stop thief - the prisoner passed me, and finding no one running but him, I went after him up a turning in Smart's-buildings; I turned round, and caught hold of him, he immediately pulled towards a house, I heard something drop, and found the seal in the passage. No person but him could have put it there. The prosecutor came up and claimed it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I ran with the people, and he took me.

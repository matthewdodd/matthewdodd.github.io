            's; he wanted to be admitted an evidence; he was told it was impossible he could, as he stood indicted; he acknowledged he was guilty with the others that were convicted last sessions, and said he could give an account of several others; he was told by the Justice, he could not be admitted evidence, but told that what he had said should not affect him here at the Old-Bailey; upon that, I went and took another with me, and took another person in Black-boy-alley, that is now an evidence here in another affair; he told me where this robbery was done; upon which I found out the prosecutor, and I was led to Hyam Jacobs by Mr. Todd, about a gown.
Q. Have you any other evidence besides Hyam Jacobs.
Brebrook. No, there was none but he. All three

                  Fielding 
               



            , and before I went in to be examined, I asked the prisoner if he knew who was in the house; he told me he was not in the house himself, but that 
               
                  Tom

I asked him who they were sold to; he said to Cowen, he did not say where, or that he was one of the people at Cowen's lodgings; he said it was impossible to get them again, for he did not know who they were sold to afterwards.
Q. Who was by at this confession?
Cogswell. I think Mr. Todd and Mr. Ripley were by at the same time.

Prisoner's defence.
I was going over Moorhelds, and happened to meet these people; as I knew them before, I had heard them talk about this, that, and the other; I knew I was as innocent of the fact as the child unborn; I saw the money paid at the sign of the Raven, they were drinking a pint of purl when I came in; I never was in the robbery; I only said I saw such persons in the alehouse, but they were not in the same settle with me.

Prisoner's defence.

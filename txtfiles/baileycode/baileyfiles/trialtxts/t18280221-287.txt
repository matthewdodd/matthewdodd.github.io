WILLIAM STAINES. On the 21st of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was at the Nag's Head public-house, Hart-street, Covent-garden


. I called for a pipe - I had this property in a bundle; the prisoner came and sat opposite to me; she came in and out two or three times, with a man named Roberts; they had a pint of beer and a quartern of gin; she told the people in the tap-room, she had just come out of the House of Correction - I missed her and my bundle; I said to the man who came with her,"My bundle is gone;" he drank the beer and gin, and said he would go with me round the market, and see for her - we went, and could not find her; we returned to the house- I asked the man for his and her name and address, and sat down to write them, but the servant-girl brought this prisoner in, and said she met her coming out of a gin-shop- the prisoner said she had sold my things.

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to the house about half-past ten o'clock in the morning; Staines produced this handkerchief, which he said had contained the property, and that the prisoner had given it to him.

Prisoner's Defence. I had just come out of confinement, and had no place to go to; through my husband forsaking me.

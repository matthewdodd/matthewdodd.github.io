Tho.King Sen. thus deposed: I keep two Booksellers Stalls
; one at the Corner of Token-House-Yard in Lothbury


, and the other in Petty-France. Last Wednesday Night the Prisoner came to my Shop in Petty-France, and sold me this Book, The Principles and Duties of the Christian Religion, for a Shilling, - 'tis worth Half a Crown. Soon after he was gone, I found my own Mark at the End of it; by which I concluded that it was stolen from my other Stall. I told my Son of it, and he said he had lost such a Book.

             Jun. thus deposed: The next Day I saw the Prisoner at my Father's Stall in Token-House-Yard; and by the Description my Father gave me of him, I believe him to be the same Person that stole the Book; and so I went into a Neighbour's House and watch'd him. He took out The History of the Pyrates look'd about him, put it into his Bosom, and was going off; but I being called out, he laid it down again.

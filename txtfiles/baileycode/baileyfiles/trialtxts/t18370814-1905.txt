THEOPHILUS WALTER
. I live in Kingsland-road, and am a bookseller. I was passing down Shoreditch on the 23rd of July, and felt a tug at my pocket—I turned—the prisoner was by my side, and he dropped this hand kerchief, which is mine, on the ground—I took hold of him, and said, "What have you done that for?"—he said he had done nothing—he straggled and fell down, and I fell on him—there was such a number of persons round that he got away, I pursued, and called "Stop thief," and he was taken.





JAMES DAVIES
. I saw him take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—what the witness has stated is true.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

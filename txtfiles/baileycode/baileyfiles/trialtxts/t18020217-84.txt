             sworn. - I am an attorney
, and live at No. 63. Shoreditch; I was robbed of my handkerchief in Fleet-street


 on the 19th of February, between the hours of three and four; I turned round, and saw the prisoner putting something in his trowsers; I collared him, and said he had picked my pocket; he denied it, but I insisted on his being searched, and took him into a hair-dresser's shop in Bride-lane; he took his coat and waistcoat off, but it was not found; I then insisted on his pulling off his trowsers, which he did, and I thought he had not got it; but the master of the shop, going on the other side of the chair, saw it laying up in a corner of the shop, where he must have thrown it.
 - NASH sworn. - I am a constable of St. Bride's, and took charge of the prisoner and handkerchief.(Produces it, which was identified by the prosecutor.)
WILLIAM HILL sworn. - I was in the room when the prisoner was searched; the handkerchief could not be found for some time; I looked up in a corner of the shop, and found it; he said, if we would suffer him to go, he would down on his knees, and we should never hear of any other complaint against him.
Prisoner's defence. I never said such words, nor had I the handkerchief in my possession.

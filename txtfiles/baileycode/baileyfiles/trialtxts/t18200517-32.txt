            , ESQ. I live at Stanmore


. On the morning of the 5th of May I saw the lead safe on the roof of my office, which is attached to my house. Next morning it was gone.


                  JOHN 
                  EDMUND WILSON
               



            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On Tuesday, the 8th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the three prisoners together at Hampstead. 
               
                  James 
                  Hoar
               



             was driving a cart, walking by the horse's head; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hoar
               



             and Foot were bothriding on the top of the cart - the horse appeared much fatigued. I stopped them coming down Hampstead-hill. I told them I insisted on stopping them to see what the cart contained - Hoar stopped immediately. I found a vast quantity of lead with some straw in the cart. Hunt secured 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hoar
               



             and Foot, and I ordered James to drive the cart into the yard, then found it full of lead. He said he met the other two, and brought it three miles from this side Watford, and they were to give him 3 s. to drive it to town. I said it was very heavy - he said it was; they had a horse behind the cart, which James said was his, but the horse in the shafts they had hired to bring the lead up; I and Pool took 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hoar
               



             and Foot to town. Last Monday I received the lead, and measured the prosecutor's roof, the dimensions corresponded both in length and breadth - it made up the whole piece complete, and corresponded in every respect. There was other lead in the cart.


                  THOMAS 
                  HUNT
               



            . I was with Wilson - he has spoken correctly.
JOHN THUSSELL. I am a carpenter, and live at Stanmore - I work for the prosecutor. I took the dimensions of the lead, which corresponded exactly, and was of the same thickness as that which was left. They took all the hip of the building away - it was not cut.


                  THOMAS 
                  HOAR
               



            'S Defence. I was going to see my mother, and stopped at Watford till my brother came back with the cart, as I had sprained my ancle.


                  JAMES 
                  HOAR
               



            'S Defence. On Saturday evening, about eleven o'clock. I rode to Hampstead, which I always do at night to clear the turnpikes. When I got to Pickersteed Mill I stopped till Monday evening at ten o'clock, and then set off to Round Head. I wrapped myself in a sack, and did not see a soul till I got to Kingsland; then four or five men passed me, called me, and said they had something for me to take to town. I asked what it was? they did not exactly give me an answer, but said it was very heavy. I said I would have 10 s., and they said we should not fall out about that. When I got to Golder's-green my horse was very tired, and I hired one of a poor man at North End.
FOOT'S Defence. I met some men who appeared to be plumbers; they said they wanted to get some lead to the Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road. I met this man, and asked him to buy it. We took up Thomas Hoar on the road as he was lame.

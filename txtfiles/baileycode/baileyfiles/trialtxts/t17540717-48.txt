; the prisoner used to help in the stables, and ride post: I missed 35 s. out of my room where I lie, out of my breeches pocket, when I went to put them on, on the 15th of June. I taxed the prisoner with it, and he owned it, and about 17 or 18 shillings were found upon him, which he said was part of my money.

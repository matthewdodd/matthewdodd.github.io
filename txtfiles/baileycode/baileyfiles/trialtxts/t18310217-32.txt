JOHN WELBOURN. I am a servant to Lord Carrington, who lives in Whitehall-yard. On the evening of the 3rd of February I was in the neighbourhood of Charing-cross


, about half-past six o'clock, or twenty minutes before seven; I saw Dutton with a cart; I heard him say, "Halloo, what are you about there?" I looked towards the tail of the cart, and saw the last prisoner - Dutton went in pursuit of him; I stood near the tail of the cart, and saw this prisoner come from the Horse Guards, take hold of the head of the horse, and lead him to the Whitehall-yard side - when he got there he got into the cart, and took out a bag, which contained 20 lbs. of tobacco; I pursued, and took him with it - I delivered him to the Police-officer.

            . I am a Police-officer. I received this bag from Mr. Welbourn - it is in the same state as I received it.

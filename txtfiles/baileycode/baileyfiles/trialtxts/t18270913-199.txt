            . I am a special constable. At a quarter before six o'clock on the morning of the 18th of August, I saw the prisoner and another walking to and fro, in Torrington-square


 - I watched them, and saw the prisoner take a cord from his pocket, and drop it down the area of No. 4; he drew up this kettle, put it under his arm, and gave the cord to the other - I went up and took him with the kettle; he said he had done it for a lark.

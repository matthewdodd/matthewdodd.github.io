BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






SARAH MYERS
. I am married, and live at 28, Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. In April, last year, Friedeburg came to live at our house—he left about the end of May, came again in the middle of July, and left in October—he had told me he expected his cousin from abroad—I have seen all the prisoners at his lodgings—Muscovitz lodged there, in another part of the house—Friedeburg said Kauffman was his cousin, and the expected him to pay him some money.

Friedeburg. Q. Did I leave in Oct.? A. Yes—I am sure you told me that you expected a cousin before Kauffman came, and before I saw any of the other prisoners.





GEORGE LAWRENCE LEE
. I am a lithographic artist and printer, at 245, High Holborn, and sell lithographic materials. About the end of Sept., from 20th to 25th, Friedeburg and Kauffman came and purchases a lithographic stone of me for 2s.—this is (produced)—a day or two after they called and said they should want to hire a press—I showed them one, it was the smaller press produced—they were to deposit 4l., and pay 5s. a fortnight for the hire—they came again in the evening, and Aaronson with them—they paid the 4l. deposit—I signed this receipt for it, and gave it to Aaronson—I lent them a printing roller and another stone, an ink slab, and twenty scrapers, without any extra charge—they took the press away—I have two places of business, and my wife sometimes attends to one of them—she was not present when I lent the press—(receipt read—Received of Mr. Alexander, 4l., as a deposit on the loan of a small litho press, two rollers, ink-stand, and one lithographic press with two scrapers, to be lent for their use for a fortnight, from 25th Sept., 1847, for which 5s. us to be paid for the loan.
GEORGE LEE.)—Alexander is the name Aaronson gave me—two or three days after, Kauffman called at my house, and said he could not make the press work—I offered to go to his place, to see it, and we went first to a house in Newton-street, Holborn, to a room on the ground-floor—I saw Friedeburg there—I do not recollect whether there was any one else—there was a German there—I asked to look at the press—they consulted a little while whether they should show it me or no—they agreed to do so, and Kauffman went with me to Short's-gardens, near Drury-lane—I was shown into a room up stairs, and the press was brought there by Kauffman from another room—the press appeared to have been tried—the handle was off, it was broken—I showed Kauffman how to use it, merely by putting a board under the stone to raise it to a sufficient height—this is part of the press (produced)—about ten days after I found this press had been returned to my shop, and another, a larger one was gone—I was not present at the time—I have since seen the larger one in the hands of the officer.

Friedeburg. Q. One morning we went with you to see the press at Short's-gardens? A. Yes—I was taken into your lodging as I passed—I did not

understand what you spoke about—I inferred what you were consulting about by your gestures—it was a short, thick-set man, a German, that brought the press into the room at Short's-gardens—I did not see any appearance of a lithographic establishment at you lodging in Newton-street—you did not go with us to Short's-gardens.





JULIA LEE
. I am the wife of George Lee. About a fortnight after Mr. Lee had parted with the smaller press, I exchanged it to Kauffman and Friedeburg for the larger one—I lent them this stone for 3s. more, at the same time.





JAMES OLIPHANT
. I am a stationer, at 47, Threadneedle-street. On 29th Sept. Aaronson and Kauffman came there and purchased two quires of paper—they consulted one another as to the quality of the paper—it was of two different kinds—I believe this (produced) is a portion of what I sold them—Aaron came again on 22nd Oct., and purchased the remainder of one of the sets of paper—it is the same sort as that on which the lithography is, and I believe it to be the same—he purchased all I had—he said he should most likely want some more of it, and I kept back a sheet as a sample—this is it.





ANN ELLSEY
. I keep the house, 8, Queen-street, Soho, where three of the prisoners were apprehended. Aaronson and Friedeburg came on 4th Oct. to look at the apartments for a French gentleman, name Marchant, who could not speak English—that was Kauffman—the same evening a strange man, with Friedenburg, brought this press in a truck—Kauffman was not there till half an hour afterwards—only Kauffman lives there—after he came I saw Aaronson and Friedeburg every day—I cannot say exactly how long they remained—Friedeburg used to be there pretty well all day, on and off; but Aaronson used to come once or twice a day—there was a bench in Kauffman's room—I do not know who it belonged to—it was brought there with Kauffman.

Friedeburg. Q. Did I Aaronson speak to your lodger? A. You both spoke to him in French.





SAMUEL STRAKER
. I am a lithographer, at 80, Bishopsgate-street Within, and sell lithographic materials. On 17th Sept. last Friedeburg and Kauffman came to my shop and purchased two lithographic stones for 3s. 6d.—this is the bill of parcels I gave to Friedeburg (produced)—he said he had no money to pay for them, that he had come out without his money, and he would step and get the 3s. 6d., which he did—Kauffman could articulate a few words in French, by which I understood that he had come from Paris, and that he was a poor artist, and he was about to do some lithographic work, and having no press, he asked me whether I would allow him to bring his work to prove—that is the technical term for taking an impression—I said he might do it—he did not come to do so—he came again on 29th Sept., with Aaronson, and purchased another lithographic stone, which was cut in three pieces—these produced are two of those pieces—I think Aaronson was the only person that could speak English, therefore he must have given the instructions to have it cut into three—he said his press was nine inches wide—that is an unusual size, and there was no alternative but to cut the stone—this is my bill for them (produced.)

Friedeburg. Q. Did not I ask you if you had any work for Kauffman? A. You made some causal remark of the kind.





ELIZABETH HAY
. I live at 9, Newton-street, Holborn. The prisoners Friedeburg and Kauffman came there to lodge in Sept., and left on 4th Oct.—they

only occupied one room, the back parlour—there was at first one bed in it—they wished for two, and another was prepared—Kauffman was in the habit of remaining in-doors all day—Friedeburg was in and out nearly all day—about a week after they came, I recollect a small printing-press coming—Friedeburg asked me if I had got any stone by me—I said, "No"—I gave him two pieces of board—he said he could make them do for a short time—he said he was an interpreter of foreign languages—Kauffman said he was a French wafer-maker—they were in the habit of working in their room in the daytime—the window of the room was accessible to the sight of any person—there was a muslin curtain to it, and Friedeburg asked for a thicker blind—Friededurg said he expected some stone, and asked me if I would take it in, if it came—Aaronson came to see them frequently—I suppose I have seen him six or seven times—I have seen him there twice a day—I have noticed when they were at home that their door was locked—I have several times gone to the door, and Friedeburg has unlocked it to answer me—that has occurred frequently—I cannot say whether they were both there then—I did not go in—I asked them for what I required at the door—I always found the door locked when I supposed they were working.

Friedeburg. Q. When did I leave the lodging? A. To the best of my recollection, it was 4th Oct.—you did not go out in the clothes you are now wearing—you wore a large morning coat, a wrapper—I do not recollect seeing Kauffman in any different clothes to those he now has on—I did not see any preparation for a press when I went into your room to make the bed—I saw the press go out—I did not see the stones come—you said you expected some letters from France, and when you received them you would be obliged to leave directly—I said it was a rule to have a week's notice, and you said it was a rule you were ignorant of—that was on the Sunday night before you left on the Monday—you paid me the rent on the Monday morning—it was due that day—I said, as you were ignorant of the rules of the lodging. I did not wish you to pay it, as you wished to leave directly—Aaronson came to you several times, and a lady and gentleman also came to the door—I knocked at your door, but only a strange man came out—I saw about thirty people coming to you backwards and forwards.

COURT. Q. Do you mean as many as thirty people came and saw Friedeburg? A. Yes—They appeared all foreigners.





DANIEL FORRESTER
. I am a police-officer. On 15th Oct. I went with my brother, and two or three other constables, to 8, Queen-street, Soho—I knocked at the door—it was opened, and I proceeded to the third floor—I struck the door with a hammer, knocked it open, and saw Kauffman standing at the head of a small table—his face was towards me—he had a pair of scissors in his hand—Friedeburg and Aaronson were standing on my left, at the table—they were only looking on—these printed papers (produced) were on the table—I immedistely secured the prisoners Kauffman, Aaronson, and Friedeburg—in a bed in the room, between the clothing and the bed, I found this parcel of notes, and in a cupboard in the room I found this parcel—(producing them)—I found this other parcel in the lining or pocket of Kauffman's coat—I was obliged to cut it out—this printing-presa was open in the room, and several stones, which my brother took charge of—there were a great many other things brought away, most of which I believe he also has—I found a key on Friedeburg, which opened the door of 45, wardour-street, Soho, where he said he was lodging—on pulling off the bedclothes there, I saw some printed parcels, which my brother took possession of—this type

was found in the room in Queen-street—I have Kauffman's pocket-book—there was nothing in it connected with this case.

Friedeburg. Q. Did you try to open the door without the hammer? A. I do not think I did—I am not sure that it was locked—I did not find any Russian notes in your pocket—it was at the Mansion House that you said you lived at 45, Wardour-street—you might have said that before, but I do not recollect it—I do not recollect that you requested me to go there—I did go the same night—the landlord told me there were two rooms taken, and that was your room, and the key unlocked it—he showed me a room on another floor, where two other persons slept—I did see any other persons there—there was no one there when the door was open—I do not recollect your saying anything about your having two rooms there—I recollect your saying something about two other persons, but whether it was that day or afterwards I cannot say—I think it must have been somewhere about two or three o'clock that I took you to the Mansion House—you wanted me to take the two men into custody—I did not do so—you told me that you lived at 45, Wardour-street, with two other persons—I did not find two persons at your lodgings—the landlord showed me the room where two persons had lodged, but they were not there.

Kauffman. Q. You say found some papers in the lining of my clothes? A. I cannot tell whether they were in the lining or the pocket—I may have cut through the pocket or the lining—they might have been in the pocket—this is the note found in the prayer-book (produced.)

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Who had possession of the prayer-book? A. My brother—I took it from Kauffman—I cannot say whether it was found on him or in the room—he claimed it—I went through all the leaves, and found the notes—I searched Muscovitz, and found these two notes in this envelope, with another, in his pocket-book—I took him the same day, at 139, in the Minories—When I went into the room I saw him fumbling something—I caught hold of his hand, and took from it these three notes—the other three were in the pocket-book—he gave an explanation of them—I took this tracing of transfer paper from Kauffman's pocket.





JOHN FORRESTER
. I accompanied my brother and the other officer on 15th Oct. to 8, Queen-street—I searched Aaronson, and found on him a pocket-book, with this note in it, also this receipt for 4l., and this bill of Mr. Straker's for the three stones—my brother produced a key, to the landlord of the house in Wardour-street, which we went to—we applied it to am room which the landlord pointed out as occupied by Friedeburg—it opened it—we went in, together with the landlord—my brother lifted up the bed and took out this bundle of notes from between the bed and mattress—they have only an impression on one side—I also found this one—I do not think there was more than one of these—I saw the note found in the leaves of the prayerbook after Kauffman had applied for it—my brother took the out of my hand, and I saw him take the note out—I produce some stone which I took charge of—I found it in Queen-street, in the room where the prisoner were apprehended—I cannot recollect where—I am almost positive it was on the table—this smaller stone laid on the table, I think—it did not then appear as it does bow, but quite plain—an of ordinary observer would not see that there was anything engraved on it—it was quite clean—we could not see that there was anything on either of them at that time—the back boards of the press were in this state (producing them, with marks of the plates in them)—I produce another stone which was found at Queen-street, with part of the note on

it—think it was found on the floor at the foot, or the back part, of the bed—it appeared then to be quite plain.

Frideburg. Q. Do you recollected, after I was locked up, my requesting to speak to an officer of the Mansion-House, and some person introducing you? A. Yes—I think you told me to go your lodging, 45, Wardour-street—I did not go then—I went at eight o'clock in the evening, and I found these notes in the room which the landlord told me was yours—I did not ask him whether you had one room ar two—I do not recollect your saying you lived in two rooms—I found the notes on the first floor, and these other papers (produced)—they were not on the floor—I think they were in a kind of bag—I searched your pocket-book, but found no notes—I have not found Mr. Lee's press.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you were acting under the instructions of the Russian consul from the begging to the end? A. I was, and I received information from tome to time.





CHARLES CLARK
. I am an interpreter. I have been employed by the Russian government in this matter—I have seen a note which professes to be an impression from the small stone—it was shown me by Mr. Peachy—I have translated it—this is the copy—I have compared my translation with that in the indictment—it is a accurate—(the translation was her read.


Friedeburg. Q. Are you interpreter for the Russian government? A. No, for the consul—the note from which I translated this is in the solicitor's possession—I wrote on it the word "translated"—(looking at one of the forged notes) I should say this is identical with the one which I translated—I can not only read what is legible, but I have transcribed into English the whole of the Russian text where the words are not quit distinct (the witness, at friedeburg's request, here read the note in Russian)—I can see the number of letters, and and that enables me to read it, but if this small print stood quite by itself, I should hesitate.





FREDERICK GEORGE NETHERCLIFF, JUN
. I am a lithographic artist, and carry on business with my father, in king William-street. I have had put into my hands a stone bearing the reverse side of a Russian note—the impression was then scarcely perceptible—it had been washed out with turpentine or oil, I cannot exactly say which; both would do in lithography, and covered with a composition to preserve it, as occasion might hereafter require—that is the ordinary course adopted to preserve an impression—if the stone is wanted for another purpose, the lithographer must grind the impression off before he could put another on it—if it was not entirely ground off, there are means by which he could revive it—after a critical examination of the small stone, I found it had gone through that process, for the purpose of preserving that which was under the composition—I removed the composition with a piece of flannel and a little turpentine; with the aid of the prisoner's roller, rubbed the stone with it, and brought up the original impression in the state in which it now is—I afterwards proceeded to take impressions from the stone, having taken it home for that purpose—it certainly was not a worn stone—I suppose the composition was put on to reserve it—that is the rule—I produce some of the impressions I took from it—I took about half-a-dozen on paper, and more on parchment.





CHARLES CLARK

re-examined. I have looked at these impressions—this is the one from which I made the translation—I make out on this side of it exactly what I have read as my translation, and have compared it with the indictment.


MR. NETHERCLIFF
continued. There is a process which we call re-transferring, which is done from one stone to another, by means of transfer paper—this stone is not in the state it was in when I first saw it—it had been attempted to be ground down, but it was very imperfectly done—the state in which it now appears is the result of the process to which I had recourse for removing what had been put on it—it now shows two sides of eight notes—you could scarcely see the front part of the note—it is my opinion that the front was first lithographical, then endeavoured to be removed, and the back placed on the same stone—by having recourse to the reviving process, I found the remaining portion of the front, and a portion of the back—I have not the least doubt but that has been effected from this smaller stone, I can prove it—I mean that the re-transfer has been taken from it—by means of the transfer paper, eight separate transfers were taken from it—this is a perfectly removed impression of the front of one of these notes—I have no doubt of it—I have seen these sheets of eight notes, and also the single notes—I am decidedly of opinion that these impressions were taken from these stones—I have not the slightest doubt about it—you will find they are the same on comparing them—I speak positively as to the back, but not to the front—it is my opinion that the impression has been re-transferred from one stone to the other—the smaller stone has only got the back of the note—I only speak to those that are eight on a sheet.

Friedeburg. Q. Have you compared them with a genuine not? A. Yes—it is wretchedly done; it is an attempt to imitate it, but very badly done.





CARL JACOB PIEPER
 (through the interpreter.) I am a member of the Bank of Russia—it is a Government bank. One rouble notes are circulated by that bank—the value of a rouble in English money is about 3s. 1d.—the rouble note has a back to it, similar to the back of these forged notes—these sheets of notes are similar to our Russian notes—rouble notes are very largely circulated in Russia, and they become very much worn—the three signatures to these notes are forged—in a proper note the first signature is printed, and the last two are manuscript—they are printed in these notes—his (produced) is a genuine note of the Russian Bank.

Friedeburg. Q. Could anybody make use of such a forged note in Russia? A. Certainly, because an ignorant person would take it as a genuine one—these forged ones have no number on them—in Russia the numbers are put on them before they are signed—it is not a note till the number is put on—there are many minor differences, but it has a similarity to a Russian note—I have nothing to do with the manufacturing department, only the signing.

MR. CLARK
re-examined. I have here a translation of the whole of one of the notes—I made it from one of the sheets of eight—(This being read, stated that on its being presented it would be immediately paid, and purported to be signed by two directors and the cashier.)

Friedeburg's Defence (written.) I am a furrier by trade, and was carrying on the same in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. Five weeks previous to my being arrested on the present charge, a man came to me named Beek, residing at 5, Ebenezer-square, and recommended a man named Max, as a worker in my trade. I wanted a man at this time to assist me. I went to Houndsditch with Beck to see Max, and engaged him to come and work. Max commenced work with me the next day, and continued in my employ ten days. During his being with me, he was visited every day by two persons named Rochelt and Kauffman; I inquired of Max who they were, he answered me, "One (Rochelt) was a partner of his, and Kauffman came with him (Max) and



"Rochelt together from France to form a lithographic establishment in this country;" I took little or no notice of this. Every day during the time of Max being in my employ, he and Rochelt were continually saying that me trade of a furrier would prove far more lucrative in France than in this country, and Kauffman promised to give me numerous recommendations to respectable houses there, and tried to persuade me to accompany them to France. Being anxious to avail myself of any honourable way of bettering myself. I thought it might prove advantageous for me to follow their advice. A difficulty however presented itself, my passport was only good for Holland, not for France; I showed them the passport, and they answered me, "Never mind, Mr. Friedeburg; we have travelled many times between France and London, and we have many friends in France, and if you will wait a fortnight, till we get letters and money from our friends, we will certainly take you to France with our passport." I finished the work I had on hand, and not having any more to go on with, I went and took a room in Newton-street, Holborn. At this time Max and Rochelt were living in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. The day before I took the lodgings in Newton-street, Kauffman came home and said he should be much obliged if I would take lodgings so that he might come every night and sleep with me, as he was badly accommodated where he was, and he would pay me 1s. 6d. a week for the accommodation; Kauffman seeming a respectable man, and having promised to give me recommendations for my work in France, I agreed to the proposal. I occasionally visited Max and Rochelt, and Max and Rochelt visited me. I asked them every day when we should go to France, as I was anxious to be working at my business again, having nothing to depend upon but my labour. He answered, "Don't hurry, we shall soon have letters from France, and then we shall go immediately." I asked Kauffman what business he was following in this country. He said, the same as Max and Rochelt had told me; that he was trying to form a lithographic establishment in this country, and that he expected his presses from France, and as he could not speak English, he asked me to go with him to a lithographic printer and borrow a press for him for a fortnight. I accordingly went with him to a lithographic printer in Holborn, and he borrowed one, agreeing to pay him 5s. for the loan of it for a fortnight, and agreeing to leave 4l. as a deposit. I bought of the same printer a stone for Kauffman, for 2s.; I asked Kauffman if he had the 4l. with him; he said he had not, but he had a friend, a gentleman, who would come with him to-morrow and pay the deposit. I then said to the printer, "I will come with this gentleman and pay the deposit. " The next day Kauffman came to me with a gentleman whom he called Aaronson, a countryman of mine, who had resided five years in Paris, and had only lately come from thence; Kauffman then said, "Mr. Aaronson will pay the deposit if you will go with us to the printer and see it paid. " I went with Messrs. Aaronson and Kauffman, and saw it paid. Kauffman took the press to the lodgings of Max and Rochelt, in Short's-gardens. Kauffman was there the whole of every day, and came to sleep with me at night. I called several times to see Max and Rochelt, and asked if they had received the expected letters, and when I should go with them to France. At those times I did not see Kauffman, he being, as I understood, engaged in his own room. I asked Max and Rochelt, "Where is Kauffman? " He replied, "He is very busy. " I did not take any notice of this, thinking he was earing money for himself in his own business. The fortnight which Max and Rochelt wished me to wait, passed away. I then began to be uneasy, as I wanted to be working at my business again. One morning, Max and Rochelt came home, and said, "Mr. Friedeburg, we have received letters from



France, and our wives say they cannot send us the money now; but in twelve days or a fortnight we shall have it for certain. Now, Mr. Friedeburg, if you will wait that time, we give you word of honour that you and us will surely go to France; and in order that your expenses in waiting that time may be less, it will be better for us three to live together for the next fortnight. " Having waited a fortnight already, and being without work, and depending upon their promises, I consented to wait the time they mentioned, and went and took two rooms (one on the first floor, and one on the third floor,) in War-dour-street, Soho. We lived there together. Sometimes I slept on the third floor with Max, and sometimes I slept on the first floor by myself. During the time I lived in Wardour-street, Kauffman came every day to see Max and Rochelt. Kauffman, at this time, had left the lodgings in Short's-gardens, where he had lived with Max and Rochelt, and had taken others in Queen-street, Soho. I sometimes called at his lodgings there, having spare time on my hands, and found him unemployed, at which I was surprised, and asked him if he bed not any work to do. He replied, "I expect work every day. " When I had lived a week in Wardour-street with Max and Rochelt, they gave me 4s. 8d., to which I added 2s. 4d., and went and paid the landlord the rent, taking a receipt, and at the same time giving him notice of my in-tention of leaving the lodgings at the end of the week; it being my design to go back into the City to obtain employment in my trade, should Max and Rochelt fail to fulfil their promise of taking me to France at the expiration of that time. On the Friday following (the 15th Oct.,) in the morning, Mr. Aaronson came to visit me. I was at the time in the third-floor room, with Max and Rochelt, where I had slept that night, Max having slept on the first floor. Max and Rochelt said to Mr. Aaronson and me, "Mr. Friede-burg and Mr. Aaronson, the Frenchman, who lives in Queen-street, Sohe, would deem it a favour if you would call upon him this morning, as he has something very particular to say to you. " I was not dressed at the time. Mr. Aaronson, said, "Go and dress yourself, Mr. Friedeburg, and we will go and see what the Frenchman wishes to say to us so very parlicular. " I went down to the first floor to dress myself, and while I was doing so Max came in and brushed his clothes. I finished dressing, and went up stairs to Mr. Aaronson, leaving Max in the room. Shortly after I came down stairs with Mr. Aaronson, to accompany him to see Kauffman. Passing by the first-floor room, I saw the door open, and no one inside, the key being in the door. I locked it, and took away the key with me. When we got to Kauffman's lodgings, I said to him, "What is it you wish to say so particularly to Mr. Aaronson and myself " He seemed very much surprised at my question, and said, "I never told Max and Rochelt to say anything of the kind. " When I got into his room I saw lying on a table many papers, having some resemblance to Russian bank-notes. I took up one sheet, and said, laughingly, What fool has been spoiling paper in this way? " and asked Kauffman where he had got so much rubbish. He answered, "I got it yesterday, from Max and Rochelt, to cut it for them. " He then requested that I would not tell Max and Rochelt that I bed seen the papers, as they had requested him not to let me see them, and said, that if Max and Rochelt asked him if I had seen the papers, he should tell them that I had not. We remained in conversation about ten minutes, when, to my surprise, Messrs. Forresters burst into the room, and declared us to be their prisoners.

Kauffman's Defence (through an interpreter.) Max and Rochelt arrived here on 26th Aug.; they engaged me, and were to pay all my expenses; Max gave me the notes on 23rd Sept., and asked me to go with him to establish

a lithographic establishment, and he bought materials for 20s.; he said we should make these notes; on 10th Sept. I had no money to pay my lodging; I went about to every shop to look for work, and could not find any; I told Max I should go; he said, if I went he should make the greater fortune; he said he should make four hundred francs; I said I would stop two days; I had in my possession the stone, the press and other materials; Max took all the materials, except the stone and press, to his lodgings; Max had the press in his possession five days; I could not work without it; all the things belong to Max; it is all owing to him and Rochelt; they brought me here, and then left me.

Friedeburg called






HENRY MYERS
. Friedeburg lived at my house, and followed the business of a cap-maker—I have seen fur caps—I saw two or three persons, at different times, in his room—I have no recollection of seeing a stout man there—I have seen two young men, who worked up in his place.





SAMUEL SLOMAN
. I live at 45, Wardour-street, Soho. Friedeburg took two rooms there, of my wife; one was a small room on the first floor, and one a larger room, on the third floor—he paid 7s. a-week—he came in the evening, by himself, with a truck—I was in the shop at the time, and he left the things with me, and went up into the little bed-room—he said he expected two men to come and ask for his room—I showed him the room on the landing; he took his tea, and went to bed—I understand that Aaronson took the lodging for him, in my absence—he afterwards told me he expected two of his men to sleep in the front attic, but did not know whether they would come that night—Friedeburg and the two men used to eat together, up in the attic, where the two men slept.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Friedeburg in the habit of keeping his roomdoor locked? A. He was, and he kept the key—he gave it to my wife, to make the bed—I never had occasion to have any communication with him, because I was in my business.

            . I am the wife of Joseph Hurst - we live in Belton-street, Long-acre


. I went out on an errand about four o'clock in the afternoon last Saturday; I had left the property stated hanging to dry on the landing, at the top of the house, three stories high - the street door is always open - it is a broker's shop; I returned in about five minutes, and saw the prisoner coming down my own staircase on the the third floor - I asked who she had been to? she made no answer - I looked about, and missed the property; I called after her, and overtook her on the first floor landing - I seized a basket from her hand, with part of my property in it; a witness took two caps from her bosom, and five from her pocket; they were all wet.

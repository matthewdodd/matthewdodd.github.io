             sworn.
I went with three butts of beer to the ship in the Minories


, on the 8th of May, between nine and ten at night; I pulled my jacket off, and put it upon the twopenny cask; the boy came down to draw a pot of beer for me and my fellow servant
; I turned myself about, and saw the boy
 with my jacket in his hand; as soon as I had placed the butt, I examined the jacket; I missed my purse, which contained three guineas, three half crowns, and seven shillings in silver; he absconded immediately from the house; he was taken up in Oxford-road, and confessed before the Justice he had the money, and had laid it out for clothes.

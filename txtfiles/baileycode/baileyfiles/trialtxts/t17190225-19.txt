The Prosecutor deposed that the Prisoner came to his House to drink Pale Ale, and sent for a Person whom the Prosecutor knew to be a civil honest Man, but he was not at Home; that while he was drinking and talking he ask'd whether he could not lye there that Night; which the Prosecutor out of respect to the Person he sent for readily consented to; he set and drank a while, and then went to Bed. The Prosecutor hearing a rumbling above in the Prisoners Room the next Morning, rose, and as he open'd his Chamber Door met the Prisoner coming down Stairs, who went out. The Prosecutors Sister deposed, that when she went up to make the Bed, she found the Room very foul and nasty,(the Prisoner having been drunk over Night) and mist the Sheets off the Bed. Three Days after they found the Prisoner at Shoreditch, who confess'd where he had sold the Sheets. The Broker depos'd he bought 2 pair, and gave 8 s. for one, that he bought them of the Prisoner; the Prosecutor own'd one pair of them. The Prisoner having nothing to say in his Defence the Jury found him

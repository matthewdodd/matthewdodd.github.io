JAMES KIRBY
. I am ostler at the Ram Inn, Wandsworth. On Wednesday night, the 10th of June, I was in the tap-room, between twelve and one o'clock—I was tired, and fell asleep—the prisoner was in the tap-room, on my right hand side—I had 10s. 6d. in my right-hand pocket—a person asked me to lend him a shilling—I got out some silver, and threw him a shilling across the table—I then put my money into my pocket again, and laid on the table—I slept about half an hour—I then awoke with some disturbance—the prisoner passed by my side, and said, "Being fair time, you may as well have something to drink, and we will have a song"—he got a pot of beer—I drank, and was then going up to bed—I then missed my money—I came down the next morning, and enquired about it, and who should I see, but Jack Morn, to whom I had lent the shilling the night before—there had been no one on the side of the table where I was when I lost my money.





JAMES WILLIS
. I was in the tap-room on that Wednesday evening—I saw the prosecutor there, and the prisoner's hand was in his pocket.





ALFRED WITTS
 (police-constable V 32.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read)—I know he is the man.

, he had been with us about six weeks, the prisoner Kirby was apprehended before I received any information, and I found her with the officer, and she confessed.
Q. Had you made her any promise of any favour? - No.
Mr. Knowlys. The man was brought to your house first? - He was, but it was after I had gone to the apartment of 
               
                  Mary
                   Kirby
               



            ; I desired her to tell the whole of it, and she said she would, if I would have a little patience; she was crying and frightened, I asked her what she had to say?
Mr. Knapp. What did you say to the man? - After I had asked her what she had to say, she said he had given her thirteen or fourteen pieces of bandanno handkerchiefs, but he had only taken two of them from me, the remainder he had bought in the street.
Q. Did the woman or the man say any thing else? - No.
Q. Do you know whose lodgings they were? - I don't.
Q. When you went back to your warehouse, or before, did you miss any property? - Before I had not, but after he was examined the first examination, I found by our number book that we had lost what is in the indictment; there were some produced by the pawnbroker but the marks were cut off.
Mr. Knowlys. Have you no other partner except Mr.

            ? - No, no other.

Q. Did you sign more than one examination? - Not more than one.

Mr. Knowlys. This man was living in your service at this very time that he was taken up? - Yes.
Q. He was going with a parcel to an inn when he was apprehended? - I believe he was.
Q. Could you then say, Mr. Peltrau, that there was any property of your's missing? - I could not discover it till we had taken stock.
Q. Have you taken stock since that time? - I have, and missed those.
Q. Can you say that there are some missing that have not been sold? - Yes, I can, I examined every number and these were missing.
Q. The first time you saw him was in the custody of Armstrong I believe? - It was.
Q. Had your partner seen him before that time? - No, he had not, he was taken to Mr. Legrew's house, it is in the way from her apartment to the office.
Q. Are you sure that Mr. Legrew had not seen him before you saw him? - I am.
Mr. Knapp. You say you was examined twice, was it before the same magistrate or different? - It was before different magistrates.
Q. This conversation that you have stated to the court of both the prisoners, was it at the first examination or the second? - At the first examination.
Q. So that if it was on the first examination, and not at the second, it would not appear here in this deposition? - I mentioned it myself in the second as well as the first.

            's room, she was with me when I did apprehend him, for I asked her if he was not the person, I searched him, but I found nothing on him but what his master knew. I produce some fag ends which were found in the privy joining her door almost. Mr. Armstrong and I had a man of that profession to drag the necessary, and there these fag ends were found.
Mr. Knowlys. This privy was for the common use of all the rest in the house? - I suppose it was, and I believe common to all the rest in the court, there is nothing to hinder them.

Court. Did you tell Stollard it would be better for him to confess? - I never told him so, I knew better.
Court to Armstrong. Did you tell Stollard it would be better for him to confess? - No.
Mr. Knowlys. Did not you tell the woman so in the presence of Stollard? - I did.
Court. Did he confess at that time? - He did.
Q. Did you tell her before him that it would be better for her to confess? - I cannot say I did, I might; I was not in the possession of what I am now, or I should not have done it.

I am an handkerchief printer; I print handkerchiefs for Messrs. Peltrau and Legrew; I generally puts the initials of every person's name that I do for, at the fag end of the piece of the handkerchiefs.
Q. Be so kind as to look at these fag ends, and see whether you should know them to be your work or not? - Here is one done at my house, it has my mark on it, L. P.
Q. What do you put L. P. on there for? - To denote the initials of Mr. Peltrau and Legrew's name; here is another that appears like it, but the name is defaced nearly; I verily believe they were done at my house.
Mr. Knowlys. I believe you would not venture to say that these would match the pattern of any handkerchief here produced? - That I cannot nor no man living can in the state in which they have been in.
Q. What are they marked with? - With a type and ink, prepared on purpose, for which I have a patent.
- READ sworn.
I am an excise officer.
Q. Look at these fag ends and see if you know any of them? - Yes, one piece was stamped by me for Mr. Bailey, before they came to the prosecutor's.
Mr. Knowlys. You as an excise officer, stamp all that are brought to be stamped? - Yes.
Q. And they cannot sell them without being stamped? - Not legally.
Q. And you stamp for all the World? - Yes.
Prisoner Stollard. I leave my defence to my counsel.
Prisoner Kirby. As for that girl Bole, she is a common prostitute, it is not the first false oath she has made by a great many; she was a witness against her own sister, and received five guineas of Mr. Armstrong. As to this privy it is made use of by a dozen misfortunate girls besides me.
The prisoner Stollard called two witnesses to his character.

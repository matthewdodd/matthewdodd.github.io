, near Serjeant's Inn; I felt my coat move; I put my hand to my pocket and found my handkerchief gone; I turned round, and saw the prisoner with the handkerchief, I seized him, and he asked me what I wanted with him; I endeavoured to take the handkerchief from him; the watchman was crying ten o'clock, and I gave charge of him; he then dropped it at my feet, and begged I would forgive him; he was then taken to the watch-house.(John Harcourt, the watchman, corroborated Mr. Royle's testimony as to apprehending the prisoner, and his dropping the handkerchief.)(The handkerchief produced and identified.)
Prisoner's defence. I was going along Fleet-street, and somebody threw the handkerchief in my face; I looked and saw it was not my own, and dropped it directly. I was rather in liquor.

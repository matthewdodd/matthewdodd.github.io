            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. On the 26th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, and saw the prisoner with three more lads. He had a bundle in his apron. I was behind them, and heard them talking about where was the best place to fence them. I secured the prisoner, and asked what he had got. He said it was some things the others gave him to carry. I found they were nine handkerchiefs, all rumpled together.

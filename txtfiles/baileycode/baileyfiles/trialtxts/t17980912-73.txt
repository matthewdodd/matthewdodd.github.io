I am a stable-keeper and post-master in St. John's-square; I was in Smithfield at the time this business happened; I was waiting in Smithfield to try to buy some cheap hay; I observed a man who went under the denomination of a coachman, walking along very well dressed, and a gay companion with him, that looked as if he was a lieutenant or a midshipman; they kept walking from Snow-hill till they got near Long-lane, by themselves, and sometimes one first, and sometimes the other.

The prisoner, Atterbury, but I did not know him by that name before, I knew him by the name of Spungy; they walked on till within two rails of Long-lane, near the sheep-pens, called the rounds; before they quite quitted these rounds, there seemed to be a stoppage, and with that the short one, Dowles, took a short turn, and knocked up the prosecutor's bundle; I did not suspect that he had a shilling about him from his appearance; I did not take much notice, but saw the tall man, Atterbury, run away.
Court. Q. How near was he to the foreigner? - A. They were all three as close together as they could possibly be; when he turned round, the foreigner immediately made a great noise; I immediately ran up, I had not a dozen yards to run; I asked what was the matter; he took hold of his pocket, and said, me robbed of 41l. I then laid hold of Dowles, and said, Sir, you are a gentleman, but you are a party concerned, if this is a robbery, which I did not suspect it was; I held him a considerable time, while my acquaintance, a salesman, said, for God's sake hold him; they sent for an officer, and he was secured.
Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He shook very much, and said, me, Sir, and I said, oh yes, I saw you do it.
Q. What became of the other man, Spungy, the tall man? - A. He ran away down St. John's-street, and got clear off; he was not taken for seven or eight days after.
Q. Are you sure that the tall man was one of them? - A. Yes.
Q. You have known him some years? - A. Yes, rather too well.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were not there at the beginning of this transaction? - A. Yes.
Q. Upon your oath do not you know there is 80l. reward if these men are convicted? - A. I do not know any such thing.
Q. You have been here before to day? - A. Yes.
Q. You were talking about buying hay and did not much attend to what passed, till there was a cry out? - A. There was no cry out till I made one, by laying hold of the man.
Q. You said to him, you are one of the men that I suppose is a party concerned? - A. No, I did not suppose it, I told him he was one.
Q. Had you observed the prosecutor staggering along? - A. No, I did not.
Q. There was nothing remarkable in two men walking one before the other? - A. No, but they seemed to co-operate together.
Q. Do you remember any body saying at the time, or the prosecutor saying to the short man, Dowles, that was not one of the men, and you made this reply, go along and be d-d? - A. I said no such a word.
Q. I tell you fairly, I shall call two witnesses to prove you did so? - A. I think you are very able to call two dozen.
Q. Having told you that fairly, I ask you again, did you or not make use of any expression similar to that? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you not say, when a person observed that he could not be one of the men, that he was, go and be d-d? - A. No, I did not.

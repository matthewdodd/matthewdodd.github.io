                  Wood 
               



            . I am a servant
 to Miss Burroughs in Southampton-street; she lodges in the house of Mr. Stroud; I lodged in Duke-street, Bloomsbury, in the house of 
               
                  John 
                  Hickman 
               



            ; I left my coat locked up safe in my box in my lodging, on the 22d of October in the morning, and when I came home in the evening it was gone; I looked at the lock and found it had been taken off, and was just tacked on with two nails, and ready to drop off; there was a little box I had left in it that also was broke open, and three guineas taken out, that I found flung behind some hampers in the room; I missed also a silver stock-buckle; I never saw the prisoner in my life before I saw him before the Justice. I never found my things again.

            . I am wife to 
               
                  John 
                  Hickman 
               



            . On the 22d of October the prisoner came and agreed with me for a lodging, about ten in the morning; he said he should be there till May, and to have tea every morning; he was to have half a bed in the prosecutor's room; he told me he then lodged at the Red Lion in Holbourn; I told him I did not chuse to take any body in without a character; he came a second time and brought a bundle, about twelve o'clock; I gave him the key; he desired a pen and ink to write a letter, as he said to his mother; he went up, and staid about a quarter of an hour; I had not been for his character; he came down again and left the key, and pen and ink in the parlour on the bureau, I did not see he had any bundle away with him. I went to enquire his character, but could not find any such person that he recommended me to. The next morning Mr. Wood missed his things; I went up into the room, and looked about for the prisoner's bundle, and I found a bundle of hay-bands put behind a hamper; I saw no more of him till I saw him in Wood-street Compter on the 5th of November; I asked him if he knew me; he said he knew nothing of me; I said I knew him very well, he was the person that I wanted; I said, look at me again; do you not know Mrs. Hickman, where you left the hay-bands; he said again he knew nothing of me; here are the hay-bands; (producing a large quantity in a handkerchief) he had a great coat on, what he carried out must be under that.
Prisoner's defence.
I never saw these people in my life before.
For the prisoner.

            . I am porter to my Lord Godolphin; I have known the prisoner ever since he was a child; he was put apprentice to a stay-maker; after his time was out he went to New England, and has since been about two years at home; he has since been with his friends in Norwich.
Q. How long has he been in London?
Scott. About half a year; he was going to settle in business; I never knew any thing of him, but a very honest sober man; he has been frequently at my Lord's house in the month of October.

                  Winter 
               



            . I live in St. Clement's-lane; the prisoner lodged with me a great while, all the summer; he lately came from abroad; he brought cloaths and 40 guineas.
Q. How do you know that?
M. Winter. I had the charge of it.
Q. How much of that 40 guineas had he left in October?
M. Winter. I believe 25 l.
Q. How much of it has he now?
M. Winter. He has none of it hardly now.
Q. What do you call hardly?
M. Winter. About 5 l. that is in my hands; no, it is not, but I owe it him; when he wants it he is to have it; he has had it at two guineas at a time, more or less.
Q. How much has he had since October?
M. Winter. He has had a good deal since October; that money was intended to set him up.

            . On the 10th of October the prisoner came to me, (I live in Tash-street, Gray's-inn-lane



) he asked me if I had a lodging to lett; I went up and shewed him my room; we agreed for 18 d. a week; he said he should have have it till May; he said he was just come from sea; I asked him where I should go for a character; he said to Mr. Harris, at the Bolt and Tun in Fleet-street; then he went away; I omitted sending for his character; he came back again with a large bundle, which he said was foul linen, and asked me if I could get him some linen washed; he went up stairs to the room, I went up along with him; we talked a good deal; I happened at the time to look into Mr. Perryman's box, which was in the room, where was his coat; I then saw it; I then went down for two or three minutes, and sent a young woman for his character; going up again I met him on the stairs coming down without his bundle; he staid a good while with me below; and just as the young woman came back he went away, saying he should return presently. The young woman told me there was no such person as Downing ever lodged there. We went up and missed Mr. Perryman's coat out of his box, and six cups and saucers of image china, and two coffee cups from a corner cupboard in the same room; I never found any of them again; here is the bundle he brought, which he had hid in the room; (producing an old woollen rag, and a piece of a hair cloth.)

            . Mrs. Jones sent me to enquire the prisoner's character to the Bolt and Tun; they said no such person had lodged there; they sent me to the Black Lion in Water-lane, but I could hear of no such person as Downing. We missed the things in a quarter of an hour after the prisoner was gone; I saw him with two other men at a bonfire in Lincoln's-inn-fields, on the 5th of November, and had him apprehended.
A. Jones. When the prisoner was before the Alderman, he was asked what he intended to do with the rag and hair cloth; he said he intended to make a saddle-cloth of them.

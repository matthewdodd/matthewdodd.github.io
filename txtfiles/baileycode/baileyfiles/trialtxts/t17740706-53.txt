            . I am a porter at Hore's wharf; the prisoner employed me to carry a box to Benson's wharf in Upper Thames-street; I had a written order, (the order shewn him); that is the order; the prisoner gave me the box out of the warehouse; I carried it to Benson's wharf. (The box produced and opened).

             That is the box I carried to Benson's wharf
Hore. The box was opened at Benson's wharf, and I saw the stockings in it.
The prisoner called a witness who gave him a good character.

            . When the prisoner was taken he confessed he had sent this box of things to his uncle's at Newington Butts; I talked to him about it and gave him an hour's deliberation, and then he voluntarily confessed that he sent the things to his uncle's.

             deposed, that he carried a box for the prisoner to Newington Butts; but, on the box being produced, did not think that was the box.
The prisoner in his defence said, he never did confess that he sent the box to his uncle's.
He called two witnesses who gave him a good character.

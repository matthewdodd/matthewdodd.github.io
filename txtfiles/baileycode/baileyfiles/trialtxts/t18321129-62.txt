             (Police-constable C 99). On the 27th of October I saw the two prisoners together - I watched them, and saw Calver go a few steps into Mr. Marshall's shop, in Cranbourn-street, take down a gown, and put it under his apron - he came out, and they both walked away; I took them into the next shop, and took the gown from under Calver's apron.

            . I live with Mary Marshall; this gown is hers.
Calver's Defence. I was going along, and saw the gown laying down; I took it up, and had not got many yards, when the officer took me.
Collins' Defence. I was coming along - I know nothing of it.

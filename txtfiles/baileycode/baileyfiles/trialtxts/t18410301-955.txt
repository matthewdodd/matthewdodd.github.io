JOHN CLARKE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of February, 27lbs. weight of veal, value 16s., the goods of 



Charles Reeves: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES REEVES
. I live in Gray's-inn-lane, and keep an eating-house. On the 21th of February I missed 27 1/2 lbs. of veal, which had hung outside the window, 10 1/2 feet high—I saw it again, and am able to swear it was mine—the person must have got up the side of the wall, as there were the foot-marks.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What was it? A. A hind quarter—I saw it at six o'clock that evening—I then went out, and did not see it again till eleven at night.





HENRY WEBB
 (police-constable G 106.) I was on duty on Saffron-hill, about a quarter past six o'clock—the prisoner came down with the veal on his shoulder—he got into White Horse-alley, and I took him—I showed the veal to Mr. Reeves, he said it was his property.





JAMES PARRY
 (police-sergeant R 8.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

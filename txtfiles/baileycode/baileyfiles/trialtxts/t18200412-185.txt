            . I am a lace-seller
, and live at No. 16, Charterhouse-lane. On the 23d of February, between twelve and two o'clock, I was going down the City-road


. I had a watch in my fob, a seal, ribbon, and key - I lost my seal, but not my watch. I felt something touch me, I put my hand down and missed my seal. I laid hold of a boy, he seemed confused, and was putting something into his pocket. I said to him,
"You little rogue you have cut off my seal!" and said,
"Give me the seal and go about your business;" but an officer saw him and took him into custody.

            . I am an officer. I was present when Mr. Daft charged the boy with the offence. I asked him how he came to do it, he said that he found it - if that had been the case it would have been dirty. I searched him, and found two duplicates, but no scissars on him.

Prisoner's Defence. Where the fire was in the City-road, there was a crowd and a great noise - I went to see it, saw the seal and picked it up.

ELEANOR UPTON
. I am the wife of James Charles Upton; we live in Spencer-street. On the 1st of October I saw the prisoner come in, and take my till—I followed him out of the shop, and called "Stop thief"—I never lost sight of him till he was secured—he threw the till down, another one took it up and ran away with it—I cannot tell what became of the money—there was 15s. or 1l. In it—we picked up four shillings—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I followed him closely, and never lost sight of him.





WILLIAM LOW
. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in Sun Tavernfields. About ten o'clock, on the 1st of October, I was near the prosecutrix's—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner and another ran past me—the prisoner had the till under his arm—I saw the prosecutrix abort I seven yards behind him—I pursued and took him—when I was about three or four yards from him he threw the till down.

Prisoner's Defence. I never had it under my arm, nor was 1 near the shop till I was taken.

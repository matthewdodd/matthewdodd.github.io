                  , from his person
            .
SAMUEL HOSIER. I am a servant
, but was out of place at this time. On the morning of the 22nd of June, at halfpast one o'clock, I was going to my lodgings, and saw the prisoner talking to some man; the man then left her - she came and asked me to go with her; I refused - she still kept talking to me, and said she wanted to speak a word to me - I stopped a minute, and she put her hand up to my breast, and took my pin out of my handkerchief; I accused her of taking the pin - she denied it: the Police-constable came up - I told him she had taken the pin; he took her to the watch-house, and took this pin, which is mine, from the back of her gown.

            . I am a Police-constable. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of a pin - I took her to the station, and found this pin in the back of her gown; she denied that night that she had had it, but she said the next morning she could not think what could induce her to do it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. It is quite false - I never said such a thing, Witness. Yes, she did.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had taken her to a house of ill-fame, and given her 5s., which he afterwards wanted back, and gave her in charge, but that he must have placed the pin in her gown himself.
SAMUEL HOSIER. I did not enter any house with her, nor ask her to go.

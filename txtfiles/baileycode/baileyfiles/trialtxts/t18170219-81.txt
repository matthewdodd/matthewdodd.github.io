            . I am a hosier
, and live in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square


. On the 4th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the flannel was outside my door. I was told it was taken, and went in pursuit of the men. I took the prisoner in St. Giles's.
GEORGE SHEWNEY. I am a bricklayer. I was at work on the top of a house in Charlotte-street, and saw the prisoner and three more go by the shop. The prisoner took the flannel in his hand and looked at it. The three men went to the corner, and the prisoner went up to them - They talked together for five minutes, and the prisoner and another man walked as far as a jeweller's shop, and came back to the other men. The other men took the flannel, and the prisoner took it and put it under his arm, and ran up Goodge-street. In about five minutes he returned again. I sent to Mr. Harris, and we went into Percy-street after the prisoner, and took him. I am sure he is the man.

            . I was with the last witness. I saw the prisoner take the flannel from the other man. I am sure it was him.

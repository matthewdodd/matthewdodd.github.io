            , and live in Britannia-gardens, Hoxton. On the 22d of December, about half-past six o'clock, I was crossing the road with my mother
's shawl on, and when I was half way across, somebody took it off my back. I turned round, and saw a man run down the street - I called Stop thief! and he was taken, but I had lost sight of him. I saw the shawl picked up in the street he ran down. I cannot speak to the man.

            . I saw the prisoner take the shawl off this girl's back. I was two or three yards behind him, and perceived him put it under his coat - he ran about one hundred yards, and I took him. An officer came up. I got a lantern and found it. I had not seen him drop it.
ELEAZER HECK. I am this girl's father-in-law. The shawl is mine.

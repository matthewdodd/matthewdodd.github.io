            . I am the son of William Cansdell, of Bishopsgate-street Within


. On Saturday evening last, about seven o'clock, I observed five suspicious characters round our door; I watched, and saw the prisoner come out of the office with two bottles of wine - the door is always open; I allowed him to come out, and then seized him; Forrester came up, and took him from me - I found one bottle of wine in his pocket, and the other in his hand; I never lost sight of him.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you quite certain you saw him come out of your door? A. I am - I told the Magistrate so.

            . I am an officer. I was passing and secured the prisoner; I took one bottle out of his hand, and the other from his pocket.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the door - a gentleman in a leather-apron asked me to hold the bottles while he stopped for a necessary purpose; I lost sight of him, and as I stood at the door I was taken.

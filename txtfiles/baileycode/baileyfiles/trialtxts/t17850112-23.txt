I was in the shop at the time, the prisoner and another came in to ask for some handkerchiefs, we had not the handkerchiefs he wanted; he then opened the door, and called a person; I said I would call any body; the prisoner got between me and the door, and he snatched off the handkerchiefs, and took them away, I saw him do it, and we picked up the handkerchiefs, and took the prisoner before a Justice of Peace.
Another WITNESS sworn.
I was in the shop, the prisoner asked for some handkerchiefs, we had none he wanted, he opened the door and came in again, and snatched the handkerchiefs and carried them off; this young man followed him, and I followed him and caught hold of his coat; I picked up six of the handkerchiefs at his feet.

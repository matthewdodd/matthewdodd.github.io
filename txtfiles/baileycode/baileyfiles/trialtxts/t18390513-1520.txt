WILLIAM OLIVER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of April, the carcase of a sheep, value 1l. 12s. the goods of 



James Barmore.—2nd COUNT, calling it 54 lbs. weight of mutton.






JAMES BARMORE
. I live in Cambridge-row, Bethnal-green, and am a butcher. About a quarter past ten o'clock on the evening of the 15th of April I received information, and missed a sheep from my shop—they had been all right about twenty-five minutes before—I looked out and saw the prisoner carrying it away on his shoulders—I ran and laid hold of him—he dropped it, turned round, and struck me—I held him till Mr. Smith came to my assistance—I gave the prisoner into custody.

Prisoner. Q. Was it moonlight? A. I saw him pass by a gaslight about a hundred yards off, at the corner of John-street—he was carrying the sheep on his right shoulder—I took him by his left.





JOHN SMITH
. I am a shoemaker. About twenty minutes past ten o'clock that evening I was at my door—I saw the prisoner take the sheep off a hook and put it on his right shoulder—I told the prosecutor, who went and caught him—I went after him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not state that I took it on my left shoulder? A. No—the prosecutor was holding you when I came up—he asked me to help him.

Prisoner's Defence. Another man, who is a noted thief, threw it on my shoulder—I was rather intoxicated—he then turned back, and said he would hold me.





JOHN FRESHWATER
 (police-constable K 146.) I took the prisoner—his right shoulder was very greasy.

Prisoner. Q. Who had hold of me? A. Mr. Smith and several others were round—I cannot say that any bad character had hold of you.




GUILTY
. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years.

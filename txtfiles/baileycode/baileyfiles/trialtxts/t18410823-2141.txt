JAMES CARAVAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of July, 76lbs. weight of lead, value 10s., the goods of 



William Spencer, and fixed to a building; and that he had been before convicted of felony.—Another COUNT, not stating it to be fixed.






WILLIAM POCOCK
 (police-constable P 81.) On the 31st of July, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Newton-street, Holborn—I saw the prisoner carrying something heavy in a sack—he took it to a marine-store shop—I followed him, and took the sack off the counter—I asked what he had got in the sack—he said he did not know, but he was engaged by another man to carry it, and he was to have 6d. for it—I waited a few minutes—no man came—I looked out, and saw no man—I kept it a few days, and found it had been taken from a workshop in Green Dragon-yard, Holborn—I have seen the lead fitted by two plumbers, and it fitted to the nail-holes.





JAMES HALL
. This lead is the property of my master, Mr. William Spencer—he is an upholsterer—it was taken from his warehouse—it was all safe on Friday evening, the 30th of July, when I locked up the place, and on the Monday following I found the wet coming in, and the lead was gone.


Prisoners Defence. I went to Drury-lane that morning, and a man asked me to carry this lead for 6d.; I said I did not mind; I looked behind me twice, and the man was behind me; where he went to I do not know.





FREDERICK BANNISTER
 (police-constable D 85.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at the office of the Clerk of the Peace for Middlesex—(read)—the prisoner is the person—it was on the 6th of March, in the first year of her Majesty's reign.

Prisoner. I was at sea at that time; 1 did not get my discharge till the 28th of May, 1840; I was at sea two years and three months.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

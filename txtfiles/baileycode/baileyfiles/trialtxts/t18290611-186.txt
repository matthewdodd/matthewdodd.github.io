THOMAS TITFORD. I am a patrol of Hackney parish. About six o'clock in the morning of the 1st of May, I stopped the prisoner in Bonner's-hall-field, Bethnal-green: he had this bag over his shoulder, containing the rabbits; I asked what he had got, and he questioned my authority;Reader took charge of him; I pursued another man who ran away, but dropped the bag, in which I found this other part of the property - here are the rabbits.

            . I was with Titford; I took charge of the prisoner while he ran after the other man.
ISLIP ODELL. I am a clerk
 to Messrs. Rhodes, of Clapton. I have a hen-house in my yard which is inclosed; I locked it, and saw it secure on the Saturday evening - next morning I found the door broken open and my rabbits and ducks gone: these are a part of my rabbits, the others are at home; the ducks were all killed; I saw them at Worship-street and knew them.

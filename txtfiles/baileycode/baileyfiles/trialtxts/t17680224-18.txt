            . On the 2d of this instant I was walking down Holbourn opposite Staple's-inn


, I thought I felt my handkerchief drawing out of my pocket; I turned round and saw the prisoner, and said, you rascal, you have got my handkerchief; he ran away, and when he was got about four or five yards from me, he dropped my handkerchief; I took it up, and called, stop thief; he was taken in Gray's-inn-lane.
Prisoner's defence.
I saw a young man pick the gentleman's pocket; he threw it down, and I picked it up; the lad ran through Staple's-inn; when he said I had picked his pocket, it frighted me so, that I threw it down and ran away.

            . The prisoner was my servant
; she had lived with me about three weeks. I was sitting in my compting-house, and heard one of my servants say, the watch was gone that hung at my bed's head. She was of opinion-that the prisoner had got it. I charged her with taking it. She said, she had been foolish, and never did any such thing before. She owned she had taken it, and gave it me out of her pocket before the constable came.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner was my servant. I was present when she delivered the watch to my husband. It is a watch that I wear. I asked her, how she came to take it? She said, she did not know; she was foolish. The handkerchief and a shirt of my husband's we found all pinned in a pillow case to her back under her cloaths, and the sattin gown she had got under her own gown. She said, she was very sorry for what she had done. They are all my property.
Prisoner. I never did such a thing before.

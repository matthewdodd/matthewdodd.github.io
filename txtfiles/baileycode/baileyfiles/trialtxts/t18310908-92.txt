            . I live in Pleasant-row, Camden-town


, On the 17th of August, about one o'clock, I was at the back of my shop, which is about forty feet long; the prisoner and another came in - I saw the other take a piece of print out of a box, and give it to the prisoner; they then went out - there was nobody else in the shop; I followed, and when they had got some distance one went up the street and the other down; I went down the street in search of the other, but he had not got it - I then returned, and brought the prisoner with it under his arm; I knew nothing of him before.

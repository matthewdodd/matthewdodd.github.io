1109. 




JOHN CONAWAY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
5th of April, 2 shillings, the monies of 



Joseph Turrell, from the person of 



Charlotte Turrell.






CHARLOTTE TURRELL
. I am the wife of Joseph Turrell, a gardener—who lives at Blackheath. On the 5th of April I was at Greenwich Fair, looking at the shows—the prisoner cut my gown, my petticoat, and my pocket, and took out 2s.—I caught him by the collar with my left hand, and said, "You naughty boy, you have cut my pocket"—he said, "No, mistress, I have not; my brother is here—my brother is here"—and he swung himself out of my hand, and went under the steps of the show—I had only 2s. in my pocket, and I lost them—I found my gown, petticoat, and pocket had two holes in them—I had felt my money safe two minutes before, when I had my hand in my pocket, and I suppose he heard the money rattle.

Prisoner. I was standing by a show, and this woman came and said I had cut her pocket—I was just going up in one of the penny shows—she seemed as if she was in liquor—she bit me with an umbrella. Witness. I did not hit him at all—I was not in liquor—his hand was through my gown and my pocket at the time I took hold of him—he ran to some other boys under the steps, and was taken by a Greenwich pensioner.





HENRY HUBBERSTY
 (police-sergeant A 5.) The prisoner was given

into my custody—I found on him 6 1/2d. and a silk handkerchief, on which there has been the name of Mitchell, which is partly scratched out—it was round his neck, but I took it off, an I know it is common for them to put them round their necks.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.

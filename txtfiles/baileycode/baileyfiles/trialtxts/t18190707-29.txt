            . I work for Mr. Stapleton. On the 7th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw a man go down the prosecutor's area, and come up with something which the prisoner took of him, and walked down the street - they kept looking back all the way. Jennings and I secured the prisoner in Mount-street with the box; he said it did not belong to him, and threw it down. I took him to the watch-house.

            . I was with Mead, and saw the prisoner receive the box from the other man. I confirm his statement.

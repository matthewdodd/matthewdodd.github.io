            . The things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of a little summer-house, in our garden, about ten weeks ago; I found the table, the bed, tea-kettle, rug, and blanket, at Mr. Davis's. We were sent for one day to the Barking-dogs, in Moor-fields; there I heard the prisoner say he had sold the table to Mr. Davis, and that he was employed as a porter to another man; but he said, that man could not have told how to come at them, had it not been for him.

            . I was coming by the Barking-dogs, the day the prisoner was taken up: I was informed they had got a man there, that had confessed he had robbed Mr. Bailey's garden. Mr. Bailey being an intimate friend of mine, I went in: said the prisoner, I was concerned with one Lovell, who was transported last sessions. [See No. 498.] this arose from a quarrel betwixt the prisoner and one Delvin: [See him an evidence on the trials of Castle and Farmer, No. 519, 520, in last sessions-paper] the prisoner desired me to go down into the garden, and there shewed me a little white house; there, said he, we took a bed, a table, and some garden tools; I was to have a shilling to carry them, and was to sell them to Mr. Davis, as my own property, because he knew, Davis and his wife would not buy them, if they knew them to have been stolen: we took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            : there was an account in Sir John's books of these things: we went to the house of Mr. Davis, and found some of the things; Mr. Davis and his wife are very honest people, and would not buy any goods that they knew to be stolen.
Mrs. Davis. I bought a table of the prisoner at the bar, about three months ago: he said, it was his own; he said he was going to sell all his goods, and was going to Coventry, to service. ( The table produced, and deposed to by E. Bailey.)

            . I was coming up the walk, from Whitfield's tabernacle, and was told a man was taken up, for robbing Mr. Bailey's garden; I went into the room where he was; he was very impudent and saucy; he looked through the window, and said, have you ever a garden here? he laid hold on the breast of my coat, and said, come along, I'll tell you something for your advantage: I went with him down Mr. Sidaway's yard: he placed himself facing Mr. Bailey's garden, saying, that is the place where we took the things. I was employed as a porter, and sold the things to the brother-in-law [to Lovell]; had he sold them, they would have found him out; he mentioned what things they were. I said, where is this brother-in-law? said he, that is best known to myself.
Welch. I asked the prisoner what business he followed? he said, sometimes I am a watchmaker, sometimes a shoemaker, and sometimes a thief: I said, how do you live? he d - 'd his eyes, and said, I am a thief, and Sir

Prisoner's Defence.
Lovell and I were acquainted together; I worked very hard for my bread: his wife being very near her time, said; he should be glad to sell these things to his brother-in-law (that is Mr. Bailey): he bid me go and tell them the table was Lovell's. He stood at the end of the street, and never came up; his sister and he had some words. I sold a table, a bed, bedding, and joint-stool, Lovell paid me a shilling for my trouble: I know nothing of the robbery. He came to me one Sunday, and desired me to take a walk with him to Duke's Place; I went with him. When he came there, he asked the Jews whether they would buy such and such things? they said, they would fetch people that should buy them. They went, and brought three men that belonged to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; they went together to a public-house; they said, they would give ready money, bring what they would. Lovell said, he would go and fetch the things, if they would lend him a bag; they fetched a bag, and he went and fetched the pewter plates that he was tried for last sessions; he put a price upon them: they said, they must go and get change for a quarter of a guinea: they went out, and got a coach, and brought him and I to the Blakeney's head, by Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's. Sir John asked him, if I was concerned along with him? Lovell said, I was not: they desired me to be kept in custody: I said to Lovell, this is a very hard affair, that I should be confined by your means; he said, Carey, I cannot help it. I said, these things that you were concerned in, that I sold, were they stolen? he said, he took them from such a place. When I came before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , on the second examination, I told Sir John of this robbery being committed by Lovell, and that he hired me as a porter; he told Sir 
               
                  John 
                  I 
               



             was not in any respect concerned in taking them out of the garden. Sir John discharged me, and as soon as the sessions was over, 
               
                  William 
                  Delvin 
               



            , who was evidence last sessions, finding where I was, came and quarrelled with me, and said, I spoke of this affair, and never was taken up; upon this, I surrendered myself up. I was detained about four or five days, and when brought before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , I was there three hours, and examined; nobody came, and Sir John gave me my discharge: and while my hands were untying, Mr. Webber came in, and said, the prosecutor was very ill in bed, but he would go and fetch him. Then Sir John left it to this court.

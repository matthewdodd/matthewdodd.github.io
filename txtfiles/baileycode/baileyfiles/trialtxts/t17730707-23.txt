            . On the 9th of June, coming under Newgate


, about twelve at night, the prisoner took my handkerchief out of my pocket; I saw him take it; I pursued him, and catched him; he dropped on his knees and begged for mercy. I did not find my handkerchief.
Q. When he begged for mercy, did he say he had taken the handkerchief?
Crump. No, he denied he had it or took it; when I turned round he was turning round as I was.
Prisoner's Defence.
Had the gentleman seen me take the handkerchief out of his pocket he must have seen what I did with it.

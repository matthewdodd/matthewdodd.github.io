            . I live in Coldbath-Fields


. The prisoner was my servant
. I missed the goods mentioned in January last, and suspecting the prisoner charged her with taking them. She owned it, and also owned the same before justice Keeling.
Q. How long had she lived with you?
R. Pope. About ten weeks.
Q. What did she say?
R. Pope. She said, she was bewitch'd. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to.)
Q. Where did you find them?
R. Pope. At two pawnbrokers. They are here. The prisoner is a girl that has been exceeding well bred, and had a good character, and I believe this is the first offence, and hope it will be the last. I fear she has kept bad company, that drew her in to do it.

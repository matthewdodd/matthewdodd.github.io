EDWIN GIBBONS
. I am an omnibus proprietor, and live at Edmonton. My premises were broken open on the night of the 7th of January—they got in by breaking a square of glass and opening the window—I missed a flannel waistcoat which had been washed, and was hanging to dry on the horse, in the room that was broken into—this is it—(looking at one)—I do not know the prisoner.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. You are sure this is your waistcoat? A. Yes—I missed this and a little girl's frock.





ANN HAYWARD
. I was employed by the prosecutor's wife to wash—I washed this waistcoat, and hung it up in the scullery, about four o'clock in the afternoon—this is it.





THOMAS WOODROFFE CRAIG
. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of January, but not for this charge—I found this waistcoat on him.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

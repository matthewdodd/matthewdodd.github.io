            . I live in Lemon-street, Goodman's-fields


. I am a cabinet-maker
, and keep a shop there; this looking-glass and winch (producing them) stood on a table about four feet within the shop-door; I had seen it that morning; a boy informed me the prisoner had taken it; I followed her, and took it from under her arm.

            . On the 13th of March, returning from some workmen in a neighbouring house to my master's, I saw the prisoner come down the step of my master's door with the glass under her arm, and she had the winch in her hand; the lower part of the glass was not concealed by her cloak; I knew it to be my master's; I went and asked master if he had sold the glass; he said no; upon which I said I supposed somebody had stolen it; my master said, I saw a skirt of a gown go from the door, I thought it was a lodger; then my master and I went after the woman; we overtook her about twenty yards from the house, and we found this glass and winch upon her.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was coming from White-chappel, I met a man who had the glass and winch; he offered me six-pence to carry it; I passed by the prosecutor's door afterwards; somebody came out and secured me, and the man was gone.

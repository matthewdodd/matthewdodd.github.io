             sworn.
Last Tuesday week, seven men came into my house, it is a public house, and staid two hours; they came to drink, and beat the drum; the other six were all stairs; they came in about six in the evening; the maid waited upon them; the prisoner was one of the seven, but he did not go up stairs only sometimes; when they had staid some time; they were taken before Justice Smith; we missed the things before they went out of the house; as soon as ever they had put the things out, they came down stairs; I bid the maid put the little girl to bed, and the child; the maidscreamed out directly, and said the money and the things were all gone out of the drawers in the one pair of stairs bed room, next to the room where these people were; they were in the dining room; the door of the bed room was locked, and the maid had the key; I went up stairs on the alarm, and found one of the windows open, which was a casement window; I not been into the room since I got up; the maid had been in several times, and the drawers were broken all to pieces, and every thing that was in them was gone; there was no money gone out of the drawers but the halfpence; the prisoner was in the kitchen when I first heard the alarm; four of the men that were up stairs in the dining room, were then come down stairs, and two of the men were missing; the four men came down to pay their money, and the girl said there were two missing, and they said they would pay for them; they went up stairs with me, and the prisoner, on the alarm, and then they wanted to be off, but I sent them all five, the prisoner and four more, to the watch-house; the other four were examined before Justice Smith, and discharged, and the prisoner was detained for taking the two guineas out of my hand, which was in the room, when he went up stairs with me, and the four others; there was one of the drawers not broke open, which had fifteen guineas in it; they could not get that open; I could not find the key, and one of the men broke the drawer open for me; I believe it was the prisoner that I desired to break open the drawer, and I believe he did so; the fifteen guineas were there safe, and the prisoner took them out of the drawer; they were in a large cup, and he poured the money into my hand; the prisoner came up, and took hold of my hand, and took two guineas out of my hand by force; he could not get any more out, I held it fast; I put the rest into my pocket, and went down and counted it.
Did you cry out when he forced the money out of your hand? - I did not.
Why did not you? - I do not know; I knew he had some of the money, and I went down and counted it; I was rather frightened; Mr. Mott and four or five more were in the room, and he said what are you at? I charged the prisoner with it.
A WITNESS sworn.
There was an alarm while they were there, of the house being robbed; they had been in the house about two hours, or hardly so much; five of the men were below stairs beating a drum; in a little while, came two men and locked in at the door; then this man went up stairs into the dining room, and beat the drum there; then the prisoner, the punch man -
What do you mean by the punch man? - He is fatter than the rest; then the prisoner came in after the six men; he staid a while below; then he said, I fancy they have muffled the drum, we will go up stairs now.
Did he appear before that to be one of the company? - Yes.
How, as he came in by himself? - He said he expected to have a bit of supper dressed, for he had five or six people to come; and the people of the house told him they were come, and were up stairs; he said, if it was a piece of pork and greens he did not care; and Mrs. Owens told him she had no orders; he went up stairs twice to the company; the maid went up stairs, and just before that, the other men came down and asked for the reckoning; there were four up stairs, and this man was five; the other two were missing, and while we were talking of paying the reckoning, the maid came down stairs, and said the drawers were broke open, and the things were gone.
Upon that, did you go up stairs? - Yes, just at the time the alarm was given, the maid said two men were missing, and the others said, G - d d - n them, they are gone a girling, or something of that kind, but we will pay for them; when the alarm was given, they all went up, I went with them; I found the drawers broke,and the room stripped; there was a drawer open, but who opened it, or put the money into Mrs. Owens hands, I cannot say, but I saw the money in her left hand; I saw the prisoner bustle up to Mrs. Owen, as if he was going to salute her; the mean while he put his finger and thumb between her fingers and thumb, and took out something, but what it was I cannot say; I asked her directly what he had taken out of her hand, and she said money; she was in a very great fright, and could not tell what she had lost; I saw Mrs. Owens count her money afterwards; it might be half an hour before we could get her to her senses.
Was it after they were taken to the watch-house? - It was.
How much money had she when she counted it? - Eleven guineas and a half.
Did she say how much she should have had? - She said she should have had fifteen guineas, but she would not swear to any more than two guineas.

             sworn.
I had a little money; and I board and lodge with Mrs. Owens; I remember a parcel of people coming to her house, on Tuesday was a week; there was six of them.
Did she tell the constable he had taken the money before they went to the watch-house? - No, she had not counted her money; she was not in her senses.


                  ELIZABETH
                   GODFREY
               



             sworn.
I am servant to Mrs. Owens; the drawers were in her bed room, and I remember where the men beat the drum was facing it, and the bed room was locked; I had the key, the windows of it were all fast; I had been up ten minutes before six; the men were in the tap room; then I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket; when I went up with the child to bed, wanting a quarter to eight, I found the door open, and the lock forced back; the window of one casement was open; the drawers were forced open, and the things were taken out of them; five of the men were in the tap room when I went up stairs, and two were missing.
Before this happened, had you an opportunity of observing whether the prisoner was in company with the others? - There were two drummers came in first, and two other young men with them; the four came in together; the next, this prisoner came in, then two more after him; when the prisoner came in, he said are there any of our people? I said there are two drummers, and two other young men, and you will have it for staying so long behind them; then he went up stairs; he came down, and ordered me to carry some pipes and tobacco up to these people; after I went up, I found the drawers open; the five went up, and my mistress; I gave the prisoner a screw driver to open the drawer that the money was in, for my mistress desired the drawer to be opened, to see if her money was safe.
Did you see him open it? - No, I did not.
Did you afterwards see your mistress have any money in her hand? - Yes.
Did she complain she had lost any of it? - She said to me when she went down stairs, that man has wrenched some money out of my hand; I said, which man? I saw him go up with my mistress, and he said, I am very happy you have lost no money; and I saw him go up to her, and pull her shawl away over her hand, and I gave him a shove, and said, what are you doing? but I did not see him take any money.
Did your mistress say any thing at that moment? - No, she did not, but when she was going down stairs, she told me he had taken some money.
Do you happen to know of your own knowledge what money was in the drawer? - Fifteen guineas, I told it over the day before.
Was it all in gold? - There was fourteen guineas in gold, and a guinea's worth of silver; my mistress counted her money before the constable came.

Who was present? - That gentleman that stands there, and two more.
How much money had she then? - Eleven guineas and a half.
You saw that, did you? - Yes.
Now when the constable came, what did she charge him with? - With having broke the room open, she forgot to tell the constable that he had taken the money, and I forgot it also in my fright.
How much money had she lost? - Three guineas and a half.
How came she to fix the sum of two guineas? - Because she was not willing to put the loss at the most, but at the least.
Mr. Garrow. Do you know whether that man was searched that night? - I do not.
Was you to have put this guinea and a half in this drawer? - Yes, but I forgot it.
When your mistress had counted her money, she thought the guinea and a half was in? - No, I told her I had not put it in; there were sixteen guineas and a half in the whole.
Did you hear any thing said about it in the room, either before or after the headborough came? - No, nothing.

             sworn.
I was in the public house when the room was broke open; I went up stairs when the alarm was given; when I first went up, I saw all the things lay about the chamber, and I came down directly; three or four went up with me; the woman went up, I did not see all that passed in the room.
Did you see the drawer open where the money was? - Yes, I went up just at the time; I cannot say who opened it; I saw some money taken out, and put into Mrs. Owen's hand, but I cannot say who took it out; I saw that gentleman, the prisoner stand before Mrs. Owens, and he was going to kiss her; says he, mother, I am glad you have found the money.
Did he offer to kiss her? - He did.
Did you observe him offer to do any thing more at that time? - I saw nothing more.
You heard no complaint of the loss of any money till the headborough came? - No.

             sworn.
I went up stairs when the alarm was; the prisoner and four other men were there, and Mrs. Owens and the maid, and the last witness, and a woman that came for a pint of beer; I only saw him in the room.

             sworn.
I went there at nine o'clock, before they were taken to the watch-house; I heard no charge against the prisoner that night; I did not hear the woman say any thing till the Wednesday; I heard nothing of the money that day at the Justice's; she told me going home in the afternoon, that she had lost a considerable sum of money; she said she had fifteen guineas, and when she came to count it, she had only eleven and a half; she said the man put his hand into her hand; I told her that was the most material thing, that she should have mentioned it before the Justice; I searched the four men, but not the prisoner.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I leave it to my counsel. Mr. Nash knows I was searched, and there was only a penny found upon me.
The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.

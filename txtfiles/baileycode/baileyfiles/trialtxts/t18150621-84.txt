            . I live at 18, Brittannia-street, Battle-bridge


. I lost my shawl on the 17th of June. I saw the prisoner at the bar going out of the house with these things; I let her go out into the street, and then followed her, and told her to come back; she said, she had nothing of mine, and gave me a black eye; I gave her a push, and pushed her down; and picked the clothes up. Mrs. Groves sent a young man after her, who brought her back.

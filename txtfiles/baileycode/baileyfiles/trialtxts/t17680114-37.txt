            . I am a Captain of a ship
. On the 14th of December I catched the prisoner, who was an utter stranger to me, in my cabin, about half an hour after eleven at night, on the 14th of December.
Q. Where did your ship lie?
Cook. She lay at Dice key


; I was asleep, he awaked me; I catched him by the hind part of the neck, as he was examining my coat and waistcoat pockets; my tobacco box rattling awaked me; he had something in his hand which he attempted to throw overboard, but it hit against something and fell upon the quarter-deck; after I had secured him, I got a light and found it was my case of razors, which he had taken out of a beauset in the cabin; I found my tobacco-box, and a small key which I had in my pocket, on the cabin-floor.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going to get on board a sloop bound to Liverpool; I was a little in liquor, and gave a man two pence to show me her; I was going home in her; he told me this was she; I went down in order to go to sleep; I had been asleep a little while, and people awaked me.

. I had placed this leg of pork in the window, and while I turned to get another dish it was gone; I saw the prisoner walking very fast from the shop - I ran, and came up with him; he had a handkerchief, with two loaves of bread, a lump of butter, and my master's leg of pork - he said, "I am sorry I have done wrong," and desired me to take the pork, or said he would pay for it - the pork was sold, but the officer has the knuckle.

The prisoner pleaded distress.

            . I am an officer. I produce a certificate, (which I got from Mr. Clark's office,) of the conviction of the prisoner on the 30th of June - he had seven days' imprisonment; I was a witness, and know he is the same man.

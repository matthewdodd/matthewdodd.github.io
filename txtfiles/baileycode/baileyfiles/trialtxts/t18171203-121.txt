. On the 5th of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, who was a customer, came to my house, and asked credit for a pot of beer - I refused. About five minutes after, she returned; my wife gave me information, I followed her, and took a pint pot from under her cloak, she had another in her hand with porter in it - I took her to the watch-house. I went to her lodgings, and found a pint pot in the frying-pan on the fire, half melted. I knew the pint pot was in my house the first time that she came. Her husband is a plumber.
ROBERT JEFFRIES. I went to the prisoner's room, and found her husband at the door. He said she had the key; he broke the door open, and we found the pint pot melting in the frying-pan.

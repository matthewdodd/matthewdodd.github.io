. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 10th of February, a female ran into the shop, and said something about some handkerchiefs - I ran out, and took the prisoner with these handkerchiefs, which she was throwing away; she was just by one of our doors as I went out at the other; I had seen them safe in the morning.

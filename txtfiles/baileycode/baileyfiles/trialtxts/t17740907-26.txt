            . I am a weaver
: the prisoner was my servant
; she was with me but one day. On the 23d of August, about six in the evening, my wife went up stairs and missed the handkerchiefs; the prisoner was then gone; we found her the next day at Peckham with seven of the handkerchiefs upon her. (They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

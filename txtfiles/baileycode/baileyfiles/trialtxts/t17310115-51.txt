The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoner was taken into his House on Charity, and being handy, was employ'd to work at mending of Linen, &c. that she having been out, did not come home one Night till it was late, was let in by the Man, and sate up in a Room; that in the Morning he found his Fore-Windows had been broke open, and the Prisoner was gone, and the Goods missing, and that when she was apprehended some of the Goods were found upon her, as Head-Dresses, and other Linen.
The Prisoner in her Defence pleaded, That while she was lock'd up in a Room, a Man came into the room, at which she was frightened; that he had a Dark-Lanthorn, and threatened her, if she made any noise he would cut her Throat; that after he had taken some Money out of a Cupboard, and bundled up the Goods, he broke open the Fore-Windows, and went out, threatening to murder her, if she did not go with him; that she did do so, and afterwards, as the Man and she sat upon a Bench, he gave her the Things that were found, telling her, he would not be ungenerous to her; but this pretence did not avail, and the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d
            .

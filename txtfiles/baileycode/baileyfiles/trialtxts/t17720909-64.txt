                   Solomon
               



             at an alehouse; Aaron Solomon told her he had a watch, but did not know whether it was gold or pinchbeck; that they went with the watch to

            , who lives with Mr. Hynam, deposed, that he was in the shop when Simons, Solomon, and the last witness came in, and asked for a pair of ear-rings; that the witness not being used to serve in the shop, desired they would call again; they said they would, and went away, and left a bonnet behind them; that the gold watch was missed next morning.

            . I left the shop at four o'clock that afternoon to the care of the last witness; I missed this gold watch next morning; I left it hanging upon a brass wire close to the window; I was present when Simons and Solomon were examined before the justice, and they voluntarily confessed that they took the watch off the brass wire.

            . I am a headborough; I had a warrant to take Levi; I went to his house, and they told me he was gone to Holland; a child told me, he would shew me where he was; he took me to the house of a Mr. Aldridge; when I was on the stairs I saw Levi break through the back of the necessary; I called stop thief! and he was stopt in a garden.
Simons and Solomon said nothing in their defence.

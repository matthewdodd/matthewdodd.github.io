THOMAS ANDERSON
. I am a coal-whipper, and live in John-street, and am married. On Saturday night, the 11th of November, I was in King David-lane, and met this young woman, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and she made free with me—she asked me to go home with her, and she took this money from my waistcoat pocket in the discourse—I went down opposite the Crooked Billet, and passed up the back lane—it was on my way home—I was a little tipsy, and she flattered me, and enticed me there—she laid hold of my arm—we stopped talking there a while, and she took 11s. in money, and three duplicates—I had nothing to do with her—she talked about my going to a house, and I would not—I lost four half-crowns and one shilling—I did not get it back—the policeman found the tickets and money on her.

Prisoner. You gave me the money. Witness, No, I did not—I had been drinking, and was out rather too late—I had drunk a great deal—I cannot account for what I had drunk—I had the money in my jacket pocket.





JOHN DOUGLAS
. I am a policeman. I received the prisoner from the prosecutor on the morning of the 12th, in Shadwell High-street—I asked her what she had done with the duplicates and money—she said the man was mistaken; she never saw him before—I saw she was uneasy, and I took her to the station, and found three duplicates, four half-crowns, five pence, and two halfpence—she said to the sergeant, "That is not all his money."

Prisoner. I was going up the street, and met this man—he caught hold of me, and dragged me away—I was going to get some beer—he took some money out, and gave me some halfpence, and I put it into my pocket—there was some paper with it, and when I came out of the public-house he caught me, and gave me in charge to the policeman.

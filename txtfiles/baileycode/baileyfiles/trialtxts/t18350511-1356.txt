JOHN CLARE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of April, 1 pair of half-boots, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Isaac Rose; and that he had before been convicted of felony.







ISAAC ROSE
. I am a salesman, and live in Tooley-street. On the 16th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner put his foot on my step, and reach these shoes, which hung over the doorway—he ran off with them—I pursued—he threw them away—I knew him well before, and did not trouble myself about him then, but gave information to a policeman, who took him the next day—I am positive he is the man—I picked the shoes up.





JOHN WATERS
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and have the shoes.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





JOHN CHRISTIE
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—he is the man who was convicted—I was a witness on the trial.

Prisoner. I know nothing about the charge.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Second Jury, before Mr. Justice Park.

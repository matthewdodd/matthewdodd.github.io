            . I live with my father and mother, at the corner of Shacklewell-lane. I was living as housemaid with Mr. Robert Budden, who is a captain in the army
; on the 10th of October the prisoner came for this linen to be washed, and it was given to her; there were three shirts of my master's - nothing else.

            . I am cook to Captain Robert Budden. The prisoner came on the 10th of October, and said she came from the washer-woman, for the foul linen; I went to the house-maid, and she gave her the shirts, in my presence, for the purpose of being washed, to be returned on the following Wednesday - we never heard of them again.

            . One night when I came home, the prisoner came to me and asked me to purchase two duplicates of three shirts. I said I would not till I saw them, but at last I did give 3 s. 6 d. for them - they were in pawn for 3 s. - these are the shirts.

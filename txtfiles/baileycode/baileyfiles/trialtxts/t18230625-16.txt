            . I live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate


, and am a linendraper
. The prisoner was my housemaid
 - she was discharged on the 16th of June, having lived three weeks with us, and next day, in consequence of information, I went to a green grocer's, and found some bundles. The officer went and took her - she claimed the bundles, and I saw two yards and three quarters of new bobbin lace found in them, which I know to be mine. I have the piece it was cut from, and it matches.

            . I am a builder
; I live in Gray's-inn Lane. On the 26th of April, about twelve o'clock, I was in a court in Little Moorfields


 - I felt a motion at my coat pocket, put my hand behind but perceived nothing. Immediately after the prisoner ran from behind me; I then missed my handkerchief and pursued him for a quarter of a mile, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner; I secured him in Fore-street, and found my handkerchief in his hat.

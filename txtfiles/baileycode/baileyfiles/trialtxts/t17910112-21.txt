            : on the 4th of January I cleaned three silver forks and one silver spoon, and some knives; I put them in the butler's room, below stairs, about one, in a tray; I went out of the room and shut the door after me, and went into the kitchen; and in about ten minutes I went again into the butler's room, and came out and shut the door after me; I went again in about ten minutes, and the door was then shut; and I looked out at a large window, which is in the room, and saw the prisoner going out up the steps in the area; I followed her, and she had got just into the narrow part of the street; I asked her what she did down the area; she made me no answer, but kept her right-hand to her apron, which was rolled up; I asked her what she had there; I told her I must see; I unrolled her apron, and the spoon fell out, and I took the fork out; I asked her where she got those things; I took her back to the butler's room, and she pointed her left-hand to the tray, where she had taken them from; I said nothing to her; I told her to stop; I kept her till my fellow-servant came in, about ten minutes, and shewed him the spoon, and told him, and he said he would acquaint his master; and she was committed; the constable has the spoon and fork: there is a door at the bottom of the area.

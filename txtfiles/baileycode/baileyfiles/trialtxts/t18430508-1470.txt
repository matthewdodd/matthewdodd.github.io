JOHN M'PHERSON
. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Read, linen-draper, of the Commercial-road. On the 1st of May I was standing outside the shop door, minding the things—the prisoners and another young woman came to the shop, looked about the things, then walked to Mr. Stephen son's—I saw Hedger go to the farther end of the shop, and attract the boy's attention while Ryan took a pair of stays, and walked away with them down Exmouth-street—they had been talking together before they went in—I went and told Mr. Stephenson.





JAMES STEPHENSON
. I am a linen-draper. I received information, went down Exmouth-street, and saw Ryan going up Charles-street—she ran two or three yards, took the stays from under her shawl, and threw them into a fore-court—I stopped her, and took them up—they are mine.





THOMAS FORBES
. I am a policeman. I took Ryan in charge—Hedger was brought to the station—M'Pherson said she had been with Ryan—she said she had never seen her in her life till that moment.





JOHN BAKER
. I am a policeman. I was called into Mr. Stephenson's shop—I saw Hedger standing over the counter—she was charged with being

in company with Ryan by M'Pherson—the said she was not, for the was not in the shop.

Hedger's Defence. I went into the shop to boy a cap; I was not near the other shop.

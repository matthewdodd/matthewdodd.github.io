JAMES BENHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 coat, value 7s., the goods of

GEORGE BLAKE
. I live with my mother, at West Wick-row, Herts. On the 20th of April, I lost this coat from our waggon, in Bagnigge-wells-road, at a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning—I was away about two minutes, and when I returned the coat was gone; this is it—here is where a calf has gnawed it when it was on the tilt of the waggon—I had seen the prisoner and another man about the waggon—I went in search of it, and saw the prisoner with it, and the officer took him.

Prisoner. The coat was picked up in the road; he said before the Magistrate, that he left it on the copse. Witness. No; I said on the tilt—the prisoner was walking quite fast, when we caught him in about a quarter of an hour—he had followed the waggon for a quarter of a mile that morning, and walked on the near-side and on the off-

side—when I left he was there, and when I came hack he and the coat were gone.





HENRY STIGUNT SMITH
 (police-constable.) I went after the prisoner, and found him with the coat under his arm, tied up in this handherchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I picked it up in the road, and went on.





THOMAS RICH
. I was an officer of the E division—I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Hicks's Hall (read)—I was at his trial; he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

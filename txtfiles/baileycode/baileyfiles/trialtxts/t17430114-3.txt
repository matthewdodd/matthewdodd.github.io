            . I lost the Things, mentioned in the Indictment, out of my House, [Had it been so laid in the Indictment it had been a Capital Offence] the 8th of December, about nine o'Clock in the Forenoon.

                  Hardwick 
               



            . On the 8th of December, a little after nine in the Morning, I missed these Things; the Door of the House was open: I saw a Woman go out of the Passage, with her Lap full of Things; but thought, she had mistook the Door, not mistrusting she had stole any Thing, but I missed them soon after; she was much about the same Stature of this Woman, but was not in the same Dress as she is now; I only saw her Back, so I cannot swear to the Prisoner.
Prisoner. That Gentlewoman's Mother cleared me, she said I was not the Woman, for she could know her from a thousand.

                  Hardwick 
               



            , I found these Things at Mr Carter's, in Broad St Giles's, and know them to be part of the Things that we lost; here's a pair of Stays, and a short Cloak.

                  Carter 
               



            , I keep a Saleshop for Women's Apparel; these are the Things which were brought to my Shop by the Prisoner, the 8th of December, between 9 and 10 in the Forenoon: And I gave her 20 s. for them - Mr Hardwick came and owned them.

                  Carter 
               



            . That good Woman brought these Things to my Shop to sell, she asked me 25 s. for them, and I bargained with her for 20 s.
Prisoner. I bought them of one who said her Name was 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clark 
               



            , and that she lived in Short's-Gardens; I went to this Gentlewoman's with some other Things. (for I am a Trader) says she, the Goods you sold me last were stopped, and it is very hard for me to lose my Money *; so it is for me said I, and I went with that Gentleman to enquire for 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clark 
               



            , but could not find her; there was one of that name had lived there, but she had been gone a Twelve-month.

            . This Woman did come again with some other Things, the last Day of December, I knew her again; and I went with her to Shorts-Gardens , to enquire for this Clark, and there had been such an one, but she was gone about a Year before.

            . She offer'd to make it up and pay me the Money, rather than come into Trouble; but at the same Time, insisted upon her Innocence, and that she bought them honestly.

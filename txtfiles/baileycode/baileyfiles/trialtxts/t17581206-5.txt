William Russel. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, at a lodging-house in the Cole-Yard High-Holborn


; the prisoner was taken up on suspicion of stealing them about a fortnight after, I charged him with taking them; and he confessed he did, and had pawn'd the stockings, and the pawnbroker brought the the breeches for eight shillings; we went to the man, whom he sold them to, who told us he had bought such a pair of him, but had sold them again; so I never saw them more.

            . The prisoner came with a poir of leather-breeches under his arm, and I unluckily bought them for eight shillings; he said they were his own, and seemed to be of his size; I have sent them down to Halifax in Yorkshire, and told the Justice the same then.
Prisoner's defence. They persuaded me to tell, and said I should come easily off if I would; I was drove to poverty, and took the things, to be sure.

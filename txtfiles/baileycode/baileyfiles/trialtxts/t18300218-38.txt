LEWIS JONES. I am a publican
. On the 26th of January the prisoner came into my house, and called for a glass of ale; he went into the tap-room, and sat about a quarter of an hour - he watched his opportunity, then took the glass, and went out; my wife suspected him, and I followed him into a court, which had no thoroughfare - I took him with my glass and another one on him.
FRANCIS DIAGRE. On the 26th of January the witness gave the prisoner to me, with these two glasses.

            . One glass is mine; this other glass belongs to a publican who lives about one hundred yards from me - he is on the Jury at Guildhall, and cannot attend.
Prisoner. I was in great distress, and had been out of work a long time.

JAMES ROBINSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of November, 2 pewter pots, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 




George Caslake; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEOROE CASLAKE
. I keep the Boston Arms, Boston-street, St. Marylebone. I lost some pots—these two are both mine.





WILLIAM PHILPOT
. I live at the Turk's Head, Harley-street. I thought it necessary to search the prisoner's pocket, and found one pint-pot of Mr. Caslake's in it.





CHARLES PARKER
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and as I was going along I looked into his hat, and found one of these pots, which is Mr. Brown's, and the other which is Mr. Caslake's, in his coat pocket.





GEOROE FELTON
. I am a police-Inspector. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

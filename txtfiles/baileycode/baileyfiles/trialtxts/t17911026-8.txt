I live at Bethnal-green, I am a cow-keeper, I was looking out of my stable, and saw the two young men take Mr. Humphrey's goose out of an out-house, it was taken out by means of a stick put over the fence, where he keeps a great many, and they cut its throat in a ditch, and hid it under weeds. I sent to Mr. Humphrey, it was about nine o'clock in the morning; I saw them taken, I am certain they are the two men.

I saw the prisoners taken, I saw the goose taken by Fairfax, with its throat cut.

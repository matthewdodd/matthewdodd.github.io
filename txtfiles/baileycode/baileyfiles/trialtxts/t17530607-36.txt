            . I live at the Red-lion in Hart-street


, a publick house. I lost a stone mug, tipp'd with silver, on Friday last; I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and charg'd him with it, I search'd him, and in his pocket found the silver tip, (Produc'd in court, and depos'd to.) He said he had had a misfortune with the mug to break it, and put the silver in his pocket, I took him before the justice, there he said same.
Q. Did he say any thing about returning the silver again?
Button. No, my lord, he did not.
The prisoner had nothing to say.

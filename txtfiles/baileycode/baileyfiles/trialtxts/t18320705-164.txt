I was told that morning that three suspicious persons were gone down Three Colt-lane - I followed, and saw the prisoner and two others; the prisoner had this bundle in his hand: he threw it down and ran; I took him - he was close by the prosecutor's garden wall when I took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

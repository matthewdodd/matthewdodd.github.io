            . I am the wife of William Palmer - we live at Ealing


, and keep a shop
 in the general line; the prisoner had been four times at my shop before - he pretends to live somewhere near London. On the 21st of May I was in the room next to the shop, and the door was open - the prisoner got in by stealth; a woman came in for a - lb. of soap - I went to serve her, and the prisoner came from behind the counter; that woman saw his hand in the till, and I saw the money in his left hand - he asked me for a pound of plums; I looked into the till, and missed the money - the prisoner said it was my money, and he had taken it from the till, but if I would let him go then, if I caught him again, I might hang him.
STEPHEN MARCHANT. I am a Police-serjeant. The prisoner was brought to me - he said he knew he had robbed the prosecutor, but he had returned the money, and if we let him go then, we might hang him if we found him again: every inhabitant of the place knows him.

JOHN COX. I am blind; the prisoner is my daughter; I had my purse, containing 10s., safe, on the evening of the 14th of November, when I went to bed - I put them into my waistcoat pocket; and when I got up in the morning I missed the purse and money - the prisoner was at home, out of place, and slept there that night; she got up early, and went away. I never allowed her to take my money.

            . I took the prisoner, by her father's desire, and found 2s. on her - I took her to her father, who charged her with this; she said she had spent the remainder - this was about four o'clock in the afternoon.

 were indicted for

 stealing 2 sheets, value 5s.; and 1 blanket, 5s.; the goods of

MARY CLARK
. I am the wife of Andrew Clark—we live at No. 10, Exeterplace, Chelsea. On the 5th of Aug. the female prisoner took my second-floor room in the morning, and in the evening brought the male prisoner, as her husband—they were with me till the 19th of Aug.—I went into the room on the 20th, and missed two sheets and a blanket—I did not see the woman after the 19th—I heard the man on the 20th, as he went along the passage—he asked me if I had seen his wife—I said I had not—this is one of my sheets—(looking at it)—it was on the bed in their room.

Keene. I saw you on the Thursday morning. Witness, I did not see you on Thursday.





CAROLINE SHEAD
. On Thursday morning, the 20th of Aug., I met the two prisoners together between eleven and twelve o'clock—Keene asked me to buy a duplicate of a sheet—I gave her 3 1/2 d. for it—this is the sheet—it was pawned for 1s. 6d.

Keene. I asked you to lend me 6d., as I had had no breakfast; you wanted me to spend the money in gin. Witness. No, I did not, I never drink gin.

Hammond's Defence. I had nothing to do with any of it.

Keene. I know I took the sheet when I paid the rent.

HAMMOND—

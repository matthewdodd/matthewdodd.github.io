WILLIAM ELDRIDGE
. I am shopman to William Joseph Beaumont, of Layton, in Essex. On the 11th of April, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came to buy a halfpenny-worth of sweetmeat—I served him, and shortly after he was gone I found two pairs of trowsers lying on the floor—I looked at the bill which had come with them two days before, and found two pairs were missing—I told the policeman, and went with him to the Crown public-house, at Laytonstone—the trowsers were found in the room where, the prisoner had been dancing, within an hour of ray losing them—I had seen them safe that evening.





THOMAS CALP
. I am a policeman. I went to the Crown public-house—the prisoner was brought out to me by another policeman—I found the property in a corner of a seat in the tap-room—every body there said it did not belong to them—I brought the prisoner, with the property, to the prosecutor, and he claimed it—the prisoner had been, dancing in the room—when I found them, he said he was sorry for taking them.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to buy the sweet stuff, and coming out of the door, picked the trowsers up.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Isle of Wight.


Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

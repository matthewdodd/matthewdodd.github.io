            . I am servant to Thomas Roper and another, wholesale druggists
, of Falcon-square


. The prisoner was their errand boy
 for about twelve months - having suspicion, I watched, and on the 14th of February, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I was concealed, and saw the prisoner come into the liquid room, take two bottles off the counter, and fit them with corks; he then took a funnel, filled them with quicksilver, corked them, weighed them in the scale, and put one into each breeches pocket; he then went into the warehouse and staid there, and at eight o'clock, when the men came out, he was first; I was concealed, and, as he came to the gateway, he turned round, and called out "It is all right, come along." I stepped out and said "I am afraid it is all wrong" - I detained him and sent for an officer. The bottles of quicksilver were found in his pockets, and the gamboge.

The prisoner put in a defence, stating that he had been induced to commit the offence by one Worms, a jew, of Middie-street, Cloth fair.

JAMES MARTIN
. I am a wholesale slopseller, and live in Houndsditch, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. I was in my back warehouse on the 22nd of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I observed the prisoner walk out with a bale on his shoulder—he was about eight yard from my front door, in the warehouse—I did not see him come in—he had no business there—I immediately ran after him, and caught him about three yards from the front door—I laid hold of him, and he dropped the bale of goods—I brought him back and the bale—it contained 239 yards of can to on, worth 11l.

Prisoner. Q. Where did you see me with it on my shoulder? A Is the warehouse—I am sure of that.





JAMES ROBERTSON
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and received the bale of goods—I took them to the station.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . These tokens were lost on the 20th of March; they were taken out of the till at about eight o'clock in the evening; I had occasion to leave the bar, and the prisoner went into it; she kept a haberdsher's stall close by; she came about seven o'clock, and had been full three quarters of an hour in our house, standing against the till.
EDWARD MASON. I went into the prosecutor's house, on the 20th of March, in the evening, to get a glass of porter; I saw the prisoner in the bar, leaning with her left arm on the counter, and she was taking the money out of the till with her right hand, and putting it into her pocket, under her apron. I asked repeatedly for the beer, thinking she was the landlady; she kept her eyes frequently looking round, and said, yes, sir, yes, sir, several times. Immediately after the landlady came in, and asked me what I wanted; I told her what I had seen, and she went and pulled the drawer out, and discovered the deficiency, for there was only one sixpence left. The prisoner denied it, and said she had no money at all about her, and it appeared when she was searched, that she had seven or eight and thirty shillings in silver and copper.

            . I live in William-street, Curtain-road, Shoreditch: I am a bricklayer. 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Saunders
               



             was my wife's sister; she was married in the year 97; I was at the church, and was present at the marriage; the prisoner is the person that was married to my wife's sister.
Q. When did you see your sister, Mrs. Coventry - A. On Saturday last; I saw her at Tottenham, in Middlesex.
Q. How long did he live with her - A. About six months; she came to me black and blue, from her head to her feet. When he left her he went and enlisted in the army of reserve; he deserted from that, and went into the King's service.
REV. MR. ROSE. I am the curate of St. Mary Islington. I produce the register books of our parish; 24th of November, 1812; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Coventry
               



             of this parish, and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Martin
               



             of the same, were married in this church by banns.
Q. Can you undertake to speak to the person of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Coventry
               



             - A. I cannot. The person, whoever he was, signed that book in my presence, and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Martin
               



             signed her name.
Q. to Mr. Doughty. Look at the signature of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Coventry
               



             - A. I believe it to be his writing; it appears to be the same letters; I saw him write his name in the first book.


                  JOSHUA 
                  MARTIN
               



            . I live at 42, Old-street. 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Martin
               



             is my sister; I never saw the prisoner until after the marriage took place. I was in the habit of seeing him with my sister at Matthew-street, Shoreditch.
Q. Did they ever produce a paper to you - A. Yes; my sister did; I rather think Coventry was present.
Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner say whether he was married or not - A. Once in the course of conversation about his being married, I told him that was a matter of doubt; he made a smile at it; he said that they were married. I have seen Coventry write; and I have seen a dozen of his letters I can swear to his hand writing.
Q. Look at that book, is that signature his hand writing - 
               A. Thomas Coventry
             is his hand writing, and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Martin
               



             is my sister's hand writing, I am certain of it.
Prisoner's Defence. I deny the whole to be my hand writing. I know nothing of the marriages at all.

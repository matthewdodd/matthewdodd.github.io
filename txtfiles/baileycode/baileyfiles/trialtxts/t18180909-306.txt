            . I live at Shadwell


. The cotton hung outside my door. On the 6th of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, Harris called me, and I missed it; the prisoners were brought back with it.

            . I am a slopseller, and live opposite to the prosecutor. I was at my door, and saw the prisoners, with another man, come up to his door, and halfway by the window, they returned back, and the prisoners went up the steps next door, the other went intothe next shop. Perkins took the cotton off the prosecutor's iron rail, and put it under Turner's smock-frock - They went away together. Turner walked before, the other man came out, and walked with Perkins; I told Haskins, pursued them, and took Turner about twenty doors off - I took the cotton from under his frock. Next day Perkins came by the door with another man, and pointed over to the house. I took him, and am certain he is the man.

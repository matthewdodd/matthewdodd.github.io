HENRY POWELL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
8th of August, 1 watch, value 4l.; and 1 guard-chain, value 5l.; the goods of 



John Henry Martin, his master, in his dwelling-house.






JOHN HENRY MARTIN
. I am a hair-dresser, and live in King-street, Seven Dials, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. The prisoner was in my employ in August last, and boarded and lodged with me. On the 8th of August, in the afternoon, I saw my watch and guard-chain on a nail, by the side of the mantel-piece, in the parlour—the prisoner was in the shop—I missed it about four o'clock—the prisoner had left the shop without his hat about three o'clock—I afterwards saw him in custody, and asked him why he did this—he said he did not know, but that he pawned the property himself—he came to me on the 4th, and went away on the 8th.





JHOMAS ANDREWS
. I am a pawnbroker, in Theobald's-road. I have a watch which was pawned by the prisoner on the 8th of August, in the

afternoon, for 21s.—I gave him a duplicate, which I have since seen in the constable's hand—this is it—(looking at one.)

Prisoner. I did not pawn it myself. Witness. He is the person.





JAMES HERWOOD
. I live with Mr. Bulworthy, a pawnbroker, in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. I produce a gold guard-chain, pawned by the prisoner, for 25s., on the 8th of August, between five and six o'clock—I am quite certain of him.





RICHARD LESLEY
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was brought to the station-house, and given into my custody—I asked him if he pawned the watch himself—he said he had pawned the watch and chain.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

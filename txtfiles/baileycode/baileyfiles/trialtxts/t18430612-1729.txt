I stopped the prisoner with the bridle and collar, about twenty minutes to seven o'clock, a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—she had been drinking, but was not very drunk—I liked where she got them from—she said Williams had hove them over her head—she then said she stole the collar, and meant to get a pony for the bridle.

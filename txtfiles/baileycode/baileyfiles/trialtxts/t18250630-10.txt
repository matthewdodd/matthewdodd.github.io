, with a handkerchief in my pocket, when a person gave me information - I pursued the prisoner, and saw him throw my handkerchief down; I picked it up and secured him with assistance.

            . I am a baker. I was on Ludgate-hill, and saw the prisoner and another boy, about thirteen years of age, behind him; I saw the smaller boy draw the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the prisoner, who put it in his apron, and they both ran away; I informed the prosecutor, pursued the prisoner, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner - I am sure he is the person.

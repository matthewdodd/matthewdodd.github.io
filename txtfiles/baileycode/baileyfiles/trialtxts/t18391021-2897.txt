FREDERICK DAWES
 was indicted

JOHN GRACE
. I am fourteen years old, and live with Mr. John Plumb, a baker, in Elizabeth-street, Hackney-road. On the 10th of October, about half-past ten o'clock, I was in the parlour behind the shop—I saw the prisoner at the till, putting some silver money in his mouth—he ran away—I called my master, who caught him.





JOHN PLUMR
. I followed the prisoner, and saw him throw something away—I ran and caught him—a young woman, in my Presence, picket up a sixpence and gave it to me—I had seen a sixpence in the till just before.





SAMUEL BENTON
 (police-constable K 49.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the boy.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

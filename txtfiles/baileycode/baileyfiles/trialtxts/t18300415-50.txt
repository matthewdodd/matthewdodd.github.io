            . I am a street-keeper of St. Martin in the Fields. On the 19th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners near Mr. Beard's shop in Sydney's-alley


 - he is a pastry-cook
; they were loitering about, in company together - they then went up to the shop, and Hayes took a tart and the tin dish from the window - Jones was in company with him; I went up, and took Hayes - Jones went away, but I sent a person to take him; I had warned him away before that - this is the dish and tart.

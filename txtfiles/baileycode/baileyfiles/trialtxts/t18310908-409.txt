            . I was in Charterhouse-lane


 on the 13th of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and all at once I felt the skirt of my coat move - I felt, and my handkerchief was gone; I saw the prisoner moving from me - I ran, and called Stop thief! till he was stopped - he pulled my handkerchief out, and gave it to the Policeman - this is it.

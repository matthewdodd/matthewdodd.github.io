2966. 




ANN JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of Oct., 1 counterpane, value 4s., the goods of 



John Spracklan; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN SPRACKLAN
. I keep the Bricklayers' Arms, Homer-street, Marylebone. The prisoner came for a night's lodging on the night of the 9th of Oct., and went away in the morning—I followed her, and found wrapped round her this counterpane, which was mine.

Prisoner. I was going to pledge it; I told the prosecutor's wife what I was going to do with it; I was in distress, and had just come out of the hospital Witness. She denied that she had it at all, till I shut the door and said I would send for an officer—she did not say my wife allowed her to do it.





JOSEPH WALKER
 (police-constable D 5.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.† Aged 38.—


Transported for Seven Years.

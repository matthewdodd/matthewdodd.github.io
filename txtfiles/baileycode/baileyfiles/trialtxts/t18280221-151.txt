            . On the 7th of February I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner and another person looking at the goods in the prosecutor's shop - they wenton, and stood talking; they returned - the other person stooped down, and took the flannel, which he gave to the prisoner, who put it into this bag; I crossed, and took the prisoner by the collar; he dropped the flannel, and I took him back.

            . I am a tailor
, and live in Gilbert-street


. I took the prisoner into my house when he was in great distress - He lived four months with me. On the 17th of September, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went to bed, and left him undressing; he pulled off his breeches, put mine on, and then left the house; I missed the articles stated in the indictment. I was alarmed before ten o'clock-the shop-door was open, and I found him gone. He was taken on the Sunday.

            . I live in Cross-court, Russell-street. On the 17th of September, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner brought the things to my house, and wanted me to buy a coat; he put down eight or nine waistcoats, some finished and some not, and said he had to go to Liverpool, but had no money; and begged of me, for God's sake, to buy them, saying he made them himself.

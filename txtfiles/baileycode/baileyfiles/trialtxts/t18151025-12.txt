            . I was walking along Leadenhall street


, on the 5th of October, at about noon. I turned round, and found the prisoner at the bar, in the custody of an officer as I suppose, with my handkerchief in the prisoners hand. I did not feel it go from my pocket.

            . On the 5th of October, I was going along Leadenhall street, and observed the prisoner walking very close to the prosecutor. At last I saw him draw the handkerchief out of his pocket. I ran across the way, and secured him. I told the gentleman, and then took the prisoner into custody.

            . On the 5th of May, about three in the afternoon, going to 'Change, when by the Poultry Compter


 I found something go out of my pocket; I turned and saw the prisoner drop my handkerchief, I took it up, (produced and deposed to;) I know I had it in my pocket a little before; I laid hold of the prisoner, he was not two steps from me when he dropped it.

            . That afternoon I saw the prisoner and another lad makes several attempts at the prosecutor's pocket; I followed them a good way down Cheapside; when by the Poultry Compter I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief out of his pocket; the gentleman turned about, the boy dropped the handkerchief and ran away; I stopped him, the gentleman came and laid hold of him.
Prisoner's defence.
I did not pick the gentleman's pocket, I picked the handkerchief up from the ground; I get my living by going about with my mother selling hymns and spiritual songs, and am but eleven years of age.

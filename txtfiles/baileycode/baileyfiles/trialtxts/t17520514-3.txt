             had some tobacco getting out of the warehouse for exportation; on the 20th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, they were coming out at the gateway with a hogshead of tobacco that was loose; about twelve yards from the place where I stood, I saw the prisoner take some of it out, and followed him, and took it from under his coat in Vintner's Alley ; there were two pounds and a quarter of it.
Prisoner's defence.
A porter that was rowling the hogshead asked me if I would smoak a pipe and gave it me.

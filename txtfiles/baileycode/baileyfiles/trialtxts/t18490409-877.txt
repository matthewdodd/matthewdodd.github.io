JOHN BAINES



, stealing 1 copper boiler, value 10s.; the goods of 



Benoni Salway, haying been before convicted.






BENONI SALWAY
. I live in York-street, Westminster. I had a copper boiler fixed in brickwork in my washhouse—I saw it safe on 4th March in the afternoon—I saw it unfixed next morning at half-past five—the prisoner then had it in a bag—it is mine.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see it in my hand? A. No; I saw it in a strange bag on my premises.





WILLIAM REID
 (policeman, B 111). On 5th March, about five o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in York-street—I went to try the prosecutor's door—I found it was not fastened, but some one was pushing against it—after trying some time I pushed in, and saw the prisoner behind the door, trying to conceal himself—he had the copper in a bag in his band—he ran and placed it in the washhouse and came to me again—I asked him what he did there; he said he merely came there for a necessary purpose—there was another person with him, who escaped.





ALEXANDER HARGREAVES
 (policeman, B 62). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted April, 1848, confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
.— Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

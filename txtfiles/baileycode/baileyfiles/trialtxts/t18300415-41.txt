THOMAS SHOTTER BOYS. I was in Waterloo-place


 about two o'clock on the 4th of February - I turned, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket; I did not feel it taken from me, but I had used it a few seconds before - it fell from his pocket; he dropped it, and began to run - I seized him.
Prisoner. He did not see it on me. Witness. I saw it on him, and there was no other person near.

            . I am a Police-officer. I was going along - the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, and gave him to me; a friend of the prosecutor's gave me this handkerchief.
Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing to do with it; I was not near it, and did not see it at all.
JURY to MR. BOYS. Q. Are you quite sure you did not drop it? A. Yes, quite - he was about three feet from me; he declared he did not steal it, and said he had a mother.

            . There were two gentlemen's servants, who said they saw the prisoner take it from the gentleman; the prisoner made no answer to that.

            . I bought the truck of the prisoner on the 1st of July - he said it was his own, that he was in distress, and his wife had left him; one of my neighbour's brought him to me with the truck - he said it had been his for some time, and that he was a painter and glazier; he afterwards brought a ladder, and I stopped him.

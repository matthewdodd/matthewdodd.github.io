. The prisoner was enlisted as a recruit
 at my house on Thursday, the 9th of March; he had some refreshment, and got tipsy - he went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock. I was alarmed in the night; I came down, and found four watchmen in the house, and the back door open. I went up stairs, and missed the prisoner - I then came down, and missed these four pictures from the parlour.

            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner in the street, about half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 10th of March, with these four pictures - he said he had been to Chelsea to fetch them for his brother, who kept a public-house near Shoreditch church.

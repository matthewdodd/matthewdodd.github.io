WILLIAM JONES
 and 




GEORGE LAWRENCE
 were again indicted for

 stealing 1 pair of boots, and 1 pair of shoes, value 6s.; the goods of




Thomas Reed; having both been before convicted.






JOHN SUTHERLAND
 (policeman, K 372.) On 5th Feb., about a quarter to four o'clock, I stopped the two prisoners in the Bethnal-green road—Jones had a bundle under his arm—I asked him what he had got—he made no answer—I took it—it contained two pairs of boots, and two pairs of shoes—Lawrence walked away, but was brought back—they both said they bought them of a man in the street—I took them to the station, searched them, and found on Jones a duplicate and a cravat, and on Lawrence two sil handkerchiefs.





JAMES PORTCH
 (policeman, K 91.) I was with Sutherland—Lawrence walked on, and I brought him back—he said he knew nothing of it.






JOHN THOMPSON.
 I am in the employ of Thomas Reed, a boot and shoemaker—he has no partner. These boots are his, and have his private mark on them—they are new, and have not been sold—I cut them out—I do not know when they were lost—our stock is very large.

Jone's Defence. I did not steal them.

Lawrence's Defence. I did not steal them.





WALTER WHITE
 (policeman, G 168.) I produce a certificate of Lawrence's former conviction—(read—Convicted Oct., 1846, of stealing boots, having been before convicted; confined twelve months)—I was present—he is the person.





SAMUEL HOWE
 (policeman, G 34.) I produce a certificate of Jones's former conviction—(read—Convicted May, 1847, having been before convicted; confixed six months)—I was present—he is the person.

JONES—


GUILTY. Aged 20.

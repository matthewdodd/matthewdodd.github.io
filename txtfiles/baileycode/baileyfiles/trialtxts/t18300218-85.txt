MARGARET GOFF. I am single
. On the 17th of January I lost a handkerchief from No. 2, William's-buildings, Chelsea


 - I took it off my neck, and put it on a chair-back- the prisoner was there, and he drew the chair to the fire- I went out for a few minutes, and when I came back he was gone, and the handkerchief; he had lodged that night with the landlord; I lodge in the same house - this is the handkerchief - I know it, but it has no mark on it.
GEORGE CURTIS. The prisoner sold me this handkerchief on the 17th of January, about half-past one o'clock.

            . I was sent for to the house, and took the prisoner when he came in in the evening.
Prisoner. Starvation and hunger drove me to it.

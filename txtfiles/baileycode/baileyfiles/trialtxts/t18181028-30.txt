WILLIAM GURLE. I live at No. 5, in the same street. I was alarmed, and went on the roof of No. 6 - I heard somebody running down the stairs. I got into the back garret, and found four pieces of lead rolled up - They appeared to be fresh cut from the gutters, and a bag. I found the prisoner up the garret chimney. He said he was drunk, and came there for a night's lodging.

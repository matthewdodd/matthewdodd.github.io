EZEKIEL GURNEY. I keep a chandler's-shop
, in Green-street, Bethnal-green


. On the 23d of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I just left my back parlour for a minute, and when I came into the shop again I found the prisoner laying down on the floor, behind the counter; he had the till down on the floor, and was taking the money out; I particularly missed one crown piece, and said,"What do you mean by robbing me?" he said he had not a farthing about him; I said, "Come into the room, and I will search you;" he came in, and deliberately warmed his hands. I got an officer, who found this crown piece in a little pocket at his breast, just large enough to hold it - I had noticed it in my till just before.

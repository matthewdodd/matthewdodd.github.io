             sworn.
I am an ironmonger
 on Dowgate-hill



. On the 8th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, or a quarter past eight; a maid servant came and called me, and desired I would come down; for that there was a great noise in the passage below, between my servant 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bryant
               



            , and two other men; he had lived with me on and off about two years, he was the porter
; the others were the prisoner 
               
                  James
                   Bryant
               



            , and constable; I came down stairs immediately; and the constable told me, that these two men had robbed me; we searched the prisoner James Bryant, and we found the goods stated in the indictment on him; we took them out of his pocket, and I asked Thomas Bryant the servant, how that man came by them, he told me that he had sold them to him; I asked him where the money was for them, he said he had got it in his pocket, I asked him to give it me; then he said that the man was to bring it at ten o'clock; they are relations, I have seen 
               
                  James
                   Bryant
               



             once or twice before call on 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bryant
               



            . I have a number of set customers; I have told him if such customers should come, he might serve them, but no strangers; we sell nothing retail, unless it is to oblige a neighbour.
Mr. Cox the prisoner's Counsel. You had left this man power to sell? - I had, as I have mentioned.
Q. But it is not a retail shop for any body to come to? - It is not.


                  JOHN
                   WEINWRIGHT
               



             sworn.
I am a constable of Dowgate ward; about eight o'clock on the 8th of this month, I saw the two prisoners at the bar; Mr. Frazier has a stable in Allhallows-lane, and the servant generally goes to look after the horses in the morning; I live next door but one to the stables, I saw 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bryant
               



             and James 
               
                  Bryant
               


             both come out of the stable together, they passed me, and I thought 
               
                  James
                   Bryant
               



seemed to have something heavy in his pockets; with that I followed him up Allhallows-lane, when I got into Thames-street, they were in Bush lane, they stood talking a little while together, and I kept back; I went into another court, called Ann-court, to see if Mr. Frazier's servant went on, and I see him cross Chequer-yard, and the other went up Bush-lane; and immediately I got into Bush-lane after 
               
                  James
                   Bryant
               



            , I overtook him in about a minute, I came along side of him, and I saw the paper in his pocket; and I stopped him and said, what have you got in your pocket? he made several excuses, that he had nothing but his own; and said, what is that to you; says I, I insist upon seeing what you have got; with that he said it don't matter, don't make a piece of work, I will give it you; says I, what are they? says he, they are a few nails, I asked him how he came by them, who gave them to him? he said he did not chuse to tell who gave them to him; why says I, how did you come by them? he then made answer I found them in Golden-lane, says I, how came you to find them in Golden-lane? says he, they dropped out of a cart, and I picked them up; says I, that will not do, you must go along with me; so I took him to Mr. Frazier's house, supposing where they had come from; Mr. Frazier's servant, the prisoner at the bar, opened the door to me, says I, do you know this man? he said he did not know the man, I said did you ever see him before? then he said he believed he had seen him; by that means I got hold of him, I got hold of one in one hand, and the other in the other; I desired the maid to call the master down, the master came down; and I told him, that I believed that these two men had robbed him; I searched the prisoner 
               
                  James
                   Bryant
               



            , and I found these nails, hinges and screws in his pocket; I found nothing on Thomas. (Produced and deposed to by Mr. Frazier as dealing in such articles, but no marks on them particularly.)
Prisoner 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bryant
               



            . I had orders to serve trifling goods if my master was out of the way; this man came to me on these goods, he told me a carpenter had sent him, says I have you got the money? no, he said, he would bring the money at ten o'clock, says I, if you don't bring the money at ten o'clock I must come after the money; he was going away with these nails, and this man came after him and took him in the street, and brought him to the shop, and called my master down, and told my master I was robbing him.
Prisoner James Bryant. Mr. Cady, the carpenter, met me this morning, and sent me to Mr. Frazier's shop for these goods, he gave me the goods on condition to bring back the goods for money, at ten o'clock; so before I had time to get up opposite the Mansion House, this man took hold of me and brought me down to the shop again, and got hold of both of us and would not let this man go up to call his master; so he held us until the master came down.

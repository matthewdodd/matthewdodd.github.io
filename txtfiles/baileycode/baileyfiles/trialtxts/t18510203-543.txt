THOMAS WILDING
. I am assistant-gamekeeper to Mr. Clarke. On the night of 13th Jan., at 1 o'clock, I was watching with Stent in Park Wood, belonging to Mr. Clark, in the parish of Hillingdon—I saw four men in the wood at the far-end of it—the prisoners are three of them—they were about ten yards from us, coming up at the end of the wood—we were coming up the side—they saw us and set off to run; we ran after them—when they got out of the wood we were close to them—there was a gate at the border of the wood, Randall and Sims fell as they got over it—when I got over, I ran right in amongst them—Randall was the first nan I got to—he hallooed, "Hold hard!"and then struck me a blow on the head with the stock of a gun; he had hold of the barrel—Sims then came up, and struck me several times over the face with a small stick—while I was scuffling with them, one of the others hit me over the head with the butt of another gun—I do not know who that was—the gun broke short in two; I picked up the stock, and called out for Stent—he came up, Randall ran to him and threw him down, and Stent threw him down—the blows I received did not knock me down, but I was wounded in the head, and the ear, and forehead—Randall was struggling with Stent, and I was struggling with Sims—Stent hallooed to me, and I ran away and left Sims—I went to Stent's assistance, and when I got within about a yard or two of him, Randall and the other one whom we do not know, got up and ran away—when I got up to Stent he had got Pizzey down, we kept him—there is game on that land, which is there.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. When had you last seen any game there? A. That same night, pheasants and hares—the prisoners did not get nearer to us than ten yards till we caught them—the wood is 300 yards wide, or more, and 500 or 600 yards long—we had got nearly to the bottom when we first saw the prisoners—there is underwood and short fir-trees in the wood—the prisoners were coming up a cart-road about three parts down the wood—the wood is enclosed with a hedge all round.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. What time of night was this? A. One o'clock—it was not very dark—the moon was about half an hour high—we had a little moonlight—it was not foggy—it was rather starlight—it was not occasionally rainy—we were out from about ten o'clock—we had not had rain in that time—we went to look for these man—when we were within sight of them they all ran away—I should think the struggle continued ten minutes—Stent was coming to me, but Randall turned round and met him—before I went to help Stent, Sims came up and struck me.

Pizzey. Q. Did I offer to strike you? A. No; you were not further than ten yards from me.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Sims known to you? A. Yes; I had known him a dozen years or longer—when I first saw him he was about ten yards from me—they were all four together—I did not know Sims when I first saw him: I spoke to him when he got over the gate, I said, "I am not far from you now, Mr. Sims"—he made no answer—I bled very much—I had known Randall and Pizzey from childhood.






THOMAS TRUESDALE CLARKE
. I am the owner of this wood at Hillingdon—Stent is my keeper, and Wilding the assistant keeper.





ROBERT STENT
. I am Mr. Clarke's keeper. I was out watching his game near Park Wood, Hillingdon, on 12th Jan., between twelve and one o'clock, Wilding was with me—I went into Park Wood, and saw four persons—the prisoners were three of them—I have known Sims and Randall from children—Sims lived in Uxbridge—Randall used to live in a cottage close to Mr. Clarke's ground—his father was a workman for Mr. Clarke—I have known Pizzey about six months—I have seen the prisoners together several times—when I saw the four men in the wood they ran away up the ride of the wood—there is a gate at the end of the ride which leads into a field—I fell down in following the prisoners and Wilding got before me—I could not see Wilding overtake Randall, but I beard as though there were mens' heads knocking about—Wilding cried out, "Bob!" and I made the best of my way towards the spot where I heard the cry—as soon as I got into the field I saw four men with Wilding—I was going on, and Randall left Wilding and met me—I said, "I know you Mr. Randall"—he ran up to me, and got hold of me, trying to stop my getting to Wilding—Pizzey then came up with a gun-stock in his hand—be struck me, but I was too near to him, and his arm fell on my left shoulder—we scuffled and both went down—I struck him with a short stick I had—I cannot tell what became of Randall—I had thrown him down—when Pizzey was down, and I was on him, two others came up and struck me three blows on the back with some weapon—I called out Tom, and went to look up to see who was hitting me, and as I turned my head I received a blow on my eye with what I believe was a gun-stock—then Wilding came up—we took Pizzey: and Sims Randall and the other man ran away—we gave Pizzey into custody—I had an opportunity of seeing Sims distinctly; be stood staring as if making up his mind whether be should come up and attack us again or not—Wilding had one stock in his hand, and he looked about and found another—these are them—I gave information to the officer.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. You ran after the men, and Wilding got before you? A. Yes; twenty yards—I heard him cry out, that made me run towards him—I received the blows three or four minutes afterwards—when I got to Wilding be was struggling with one who I believe was Sims—I saw Pizzey so as to see that he struck me—I had hold of him when I was struck on the eye—it took five or six minutes altogether.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How many persons were outside the wood? A. Five beside myself.

Pizzey. I had not a piece of wood to strike anybody with.





GEORGE GIBSON LYNN
 (policeman, T 197). At a quarter-past one o'clock in the morning, on 13th Jan., I was on duty at Ickenham—I met Wilding and Stent with Pizzey in their custody—I took him—Wilding and Stent were very bloody—they gave me information, and I went to Randall's lodging at Ux bridge, which is about two miles and a half from Mr. Clarke's wood—I gained admittance—Randall came down-stairs, and I took him—I told him I took him for an assault—he said, "very well; he would go"—going along, he said, "When I get over this," or "out of this, I will never get into another job like this"—he said he would leave Uxbridge, and it was a bad job he ever came to Uxbridge.






WILLIAM BEXCHEY
 (policeman, T 182). I went with Lynn about four o'clock in the morning of 13th Jan. to apprehend Randall. About five that morning I went to Sims, who lodges with his father, a labouring man, at Uxbridge—I knocked at the door—I saw Sims when he got up—I told him I wanted him on a charge of assaulting the keepers—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and on the road there he said if he had been there be should not have been fool enough to have said so.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Did you go to his bed-room? A. No: I waited, till he got up—he came to the window, and when he came down I told him what I wanted him for—there were witnesses before the Magistrate to prove that Sims was in the house all night.

Pizzey. I never struck either of the keepers, nor had anything in my hand. Witnesses for the Defence.






ANN SMITH
. My husband is a gardener—I act as a nurse—I was nursing the wife of John Walker, at Uxbridge—Sims lives there. On the morning be was taken I was there—I remember Sims coming in the evening before, at half-past nine o'clock—I knew the time; we bad a clock—he went up to bed at a quarter before ten—be did not come out of the house again; he could not, without my seeing or bearing him—I did not sleep at all—I was in the bottom room—he must have come through that room to have gone outside the house—he went up-stairs, and did not come down again till the officer came for him—I was before the Magistrate.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many rooms are in this house? A. Three up-stairs and one down—I am a monthly nurse—Sims' sister is Walker's wife—Walker was one of the witnesses before the Magistrate, and Sims' father also; he is not here—Sims usually slept with his father, and during the confinement Walker slept in the same room in which Sims and his father did—it was the top room—the house is two stories high—the room I sat up in all night was down-stairs—Mrs. Walker was in a room on the first-floor—there is another room on the first-floor, in which Patterson, a gardener, lives; he was at home that night—I paid my expenses of coming here to-day—I came on the coach by myself, before Walker did—there is a window in Walker and Sims' bedroom—Sims took his supper in the kitchen on the ground-floor—I was not in the kitchen when be took it; I was in the first-floor—I know he took it, because he came into the room where I was with his topper in his hand.

COURT. Q. What room were you sitting in? A. The front room, down-stairs; Mrs. Walker was on the first-floor up-stairs—to get from the ground-floor to the first-floor you go up-stairs, and you get from the first-floor to the second-floor by going up-stairs—the second-floor is the room where Sims and Walker slept, at the top of the house—I sat up as nurse with Mrs. Walker—the bedroom door was not shut all night—it was on Sunday night, 12th Jan., that Sims came home—there was a fireplace down-stairs, not in Mrs. Walker's room—she had been confined one week—the room I was sitting in was very small—I was sitting in the chair; I did not lie down at all; I was obliged to be up with the child; it was bringing up by hand; Mrs. Walker is a delicate woman, and has bad breasts—I thought it was best for her, to leave the door open; it is a very small room, and it was hot—after Sims had had his supper he went up-stairs: I was down-stairs—I staid a couple of hours before I went

up-stairs again—I then went up into Mrs. Walker's room—I left the door open while I came down-stairs—I went up and came down the second time—I do not know how long I staid then—I went up backwards and forwards a great many times; perhaps the second time I stopped an hour—there is a back-door to the house—I left the room door down-stairs open also; that is where the fireplace was—I saw nothing more of Sims till the policeman took him, between five and six—I did not see him till eight in the morning; that was at the station—the outer door opens into the room where the fire was—there is another door that opens from the kitchen into the garden—there is no other room on that floor but the kitchen; there is no passage—I fastened the doors that night, both back and front; I cannot say what time it was before nine; then I went up to Mrs. Walker's room—I cannot say what time I went up for the last time that night—I believe I saw Sims' father last Tuesday; he was here—I live in Uxbridge—no one took me before the Magistrate; I took myself—his father came after me, before eleven o'clock; I was then at Mrs. Walker's—I cannot tell how high the top room is from the ground—it is not a very large house; the rooms are not very large—I never saw a ladder in the house; I never looked in the back part—I am no relation to either of the prisoners—there is no room below the kitchen—there are two rooms on the ground-floor; the back room is the kitchen—you cannot get from the front room to the stairs without going into the kitchen—I did not say so before—I did not understand it—there are two rooms on the first-floor, one back and one front—Mrs. Walker occupied the back room, and Mr. Patterson the front; he has a wife—there is only one attic on the second-floor—I did not see Sims go out when I was in the kitchen or in Mrs. Walker's room—Sims' father is a labouring man; he works for Mr. Grainger, who keeps a shop in Uxbridge, and sells iron-work and rails—I do net know the other two prisoners; I do not know that I ever saw them before Monday—I had been nursing Mrs. Walker a week: I do not know that I had seen Randall or Pizzey in that time—I think on the Saturday night Sims was at home with his father—I do not look after him—I do not know that he was out the night before; I cannot say—I have not received money for coming here, or going before the Magistrate—I was not examined by any person on this matter to know what I had to say—I was never questioned by any gentleman before I made the statement that I have been examined from to-day—Sims could not have gone down-stairs without my seeing him—I never said so before to-day.

MR. HORRY. Q. You went before the Magistrate the next morning? A. Yes; I had not heard before that, what Sims was taken for; I knew he was taken—his father came and fetched me to go before the Magistrate—I made the statement which I have to-day—no one examined me before I went, and no one since—the stairs are in the kitchen—the room opens into the street—there is no passage—I was up and down all night—I did not sleep at all—from the position I was in, no one could have unbolted the doors and gone out without my knowing it; neither back nor front—I am certain neither of those doors was left open.





JOHN WALKER
. I am a sawyer, and live at Uxbridge; I occupy the house; Sims and his father occupy the garret. I recollect the night before Sims was taken—he came home that evening at half-past nine, and went

to bed a quarter before ten—I slept in the same room—I saw him get into bed—I was in bed at the time—as far as I am aware, he did not come out of that room again—I recollect the policeman coming to fetch him in the morning; I saw him get out of bed then.

Cross-examined. Q. What is he? A. A labouring chap; he was working for nobody at all at that time as I know of—he has never been in constant work—I cannot say when he had a job—he sat up to watch some meat for David Neal, sometimes one night in a week, and sometimes two nights—he came to bed at a quarter before ten o'clock; I am sure it was before ten—I have a watch, and I looked at it when I went up, about half-past nine—I had been in bed about two minutes when he came—it did not take me a quarter of an hour to undress and go to bed—I had to say my prayers first—Sims' father was in bed with him; I cannot say whether he was awake, he is not here—I did not sleep all that night; the child crying awoke me—it did not cry all night—I cannot tell what time I was awoke by it—I did not strike a light—it was dark—my bed is a few yards from Sims'—the room my wife was in with the nurse is a little back-room—Patterson went to bed between nine and ten—the door of the room where my wife was, fastens with a lock—I did not notice what sort of weather it was—my bed is on the ground, about one yard from the door, opposite the door—the door fastens inside, there is no lock on it—I went from the room where my wife was that night—I shut the door after me—I did not hear the door open or shut when the nurse went in or out—Sims has a brother, about ten years old, who slept with him—he is not here.

MR. HORRY. Q. Have you paid your own expenses to come up? A. Yes; it has cost me about 4s. a day—I made the same statement before the Magistrate that I have to-day—Sims' father came up on Monday, and stopped all Tuesday; he could not stop longer—he has regular employ—the room in which my wife was confined is rather close—there is a window in it, about forty feet from the ground.

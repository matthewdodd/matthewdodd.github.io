            . I am a watchman on Galley-key


: on the 15th of March I saw the prisoner loitering about the key; he opened the head of a hogshead of tobacco, and took out some tobacco. I went and stopt him at the gate-way; he said, D - n you, if you don't let me go I'll knock your eyes out: he threw some of it away: I took this tobacco from out of his breeches, (producing about a pound and three quarters.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going to the necessary-house, and found this tobacco behind the door.

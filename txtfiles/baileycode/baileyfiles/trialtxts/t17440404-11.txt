            . The Prisoner came to my shop (I think on a Saturday night) to pawn a spoon, I asked her whose property it was, she said she was then a nurse keeping at a gentlewoman's at Tottenham-court, who desired her to pawn it; I not being satisfied with this account, told her I should have occasion to go that way the next morning, and would call there; then she began to hesitate, I told her I would stop the spoon, and if she brought any body to give an account of her she should have it again; but she not coming in two or three days I advertised it, and Mr. Cosby came and owned it.

             On Saturday the eight of October, as the prisoner passed me, I clapped my hand upon my pocket and missed my tobacco box, and I turned about and took hold of him .
Q. Had you any reason to suspect any body else?
Chiswell . No, the prisoner had got across the Kennel, and the box dropped out of his hand.
Q. Do you know what the prisoner is ?
Chiswell. No, what induced me to prosecute him was, that the keeper of Bridewell said, he had broke out of Bridewell, and he was out after him to take him.

            . Oh, I am frightened, I do not know what to say .
Q. Do you know the prisoner?
Gardner. I have known him several years, and never heard but that he was a sober honest lad.

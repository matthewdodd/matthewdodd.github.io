            . I keep the Star and Garter
, a publick-house in the Strand


, the things mentioned were missing on the 2d of March out of a drawer; the prisoner was a customer of mine, he came that night and said he was locked out of his lodgings, and desired I would let him lie in my house, I let him and his friend, a young man. They lay in the room where the drawers were; the young man got up about eight, and the prisoner came down about ten. I missed the things between ten and eleven, we suspected the prisoner, I took him up, and told him I was robbed of five crown pieces, and the other things; he seem'd to lay it very hard upon the other young man. I went with him to seek for the young man, and found him in the prisoner's lodgings, they both lodged together, the prisoner opened a drawer of his, and took some things out, and after that a shift of my wife's was found in his bed, which since he owned he took out there, and put into the bed. He owned in the prison before me, that he took the three pair of cotton stockings, and had made away with them, that they might not appeared an evidence against him. He owned he had had the five crown pieces, and he had changed them, and that I could not have three of them again, for he had changed them to different people. I have two again, which I gave 10 s. for to two people that said they had changed them for him. They are not here.
Q. Did he say where he took these things?


                  George 
                  Davis 
               



            . No, he did not, he only said he had taken them.

                  Davis 
               



            . I heard the prisoner confess the 26th of March, in New-prison (he knowing that Mr. Davis had got two of them again ) he said them two he might keep, the other three were changed to people going abroad.
Mrs. Davis. I am wife to the prosecutor, I saw my shift at justice St. Lawrence's, they said it was found in the prisoner's bed, but that I only know by hearsay. I had these crown pieces in my left-hand the night before they were missing, and I put them in the drawer and locked it, and found it locked next morning, when the things were gone.
Prisoner's defence.
I am innocent of the fact.
For the prisoner.

            . I have known the prisoner ever since he was a child, he is a very honest man, he was born in a place called Dublin in Ireland.

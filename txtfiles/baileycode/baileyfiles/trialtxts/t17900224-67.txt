I live at No. 9, Rose-street, Covent-garden



: I keep Covent-garden-market
: at different times, I have lost different things: on the 14th of February, at night, I missed two gowns; this was Sunday; on the next day, Monday morning, I missed three aprons, one frock, a pair of sheets, and my husband's coat (he is dead) a pair of flat irons, and a bed-gown. I taxed the prisoner, 
               
                  Sarah
                   Walton
               



            , with the two gowns, on the 14th, on Sunday night, with knowing where they must be, or what she had done with them: she would not tell at first, till I threatened to call the watch; then she owned to knowing of one gown, and that she would get it me in the morning: I told her if that she knew of one, she must know of the other, not missing any thing else then; she would not own any thing till I called the watch: and she was taken to the watch-house: I told her if she would own to any thing, I would not put her in charge. The next morning, 
               
                  Susannah
                   Warren
               



            , whom I have seen once or twice in my room, as she rents a room in the house, it being let out in tenements; she came to me, and said she would get the duplicates, and I should have my things again; on that, I told her I could not do any thing with the duplicates, as I had not money to redeem my things, they coming to two guineas; I found, by the duplicates, the things were pawned at Mr. Merrish's, the corner of Rose-street: I then took them before the magistrate, with her; and when they were first called for before the magistrate, she at first denied them; but when they were going to search her, she pulled them out of her bosom; and the pawnbroker was sent for, and the things he had in possession, which answered to the duplicates, except the sheets, as I could not swear to them.

            ; and in her own name; (produced): the coat was pawned on the 23d of January, for five shillings, a gown for twelve shillings on the 20th of January, in the name of

(The things deposed to by Mrs. Doyle.)
Mr. Knowlys, Prisoners Counsel. This woman has a large family, and has been in the habit of pawning and redeeming, a long while? - Yes.
I believe she once lost a duplicate; and to enable her to redeem the things, made an affidavit? - Yes; but it was never produced.

CATHERINE WEBB
. I am the wife of Alexander Webb, and the mother of Julia Webb, and live in the Curtain-road. I sent my daughter Eliza out for half an hour on the 16th of August—she had these things on when the went out, and when she was brought back they were all gone.





JULIA WEBB
. I am eight years old. I went out with my sister Eliza in the 16th of August—she had a frock, bonnet, and pinafore on—I went to get a farthing's-worth of sweet stuff, and this prisoner met me in the Curtain-road, and asked me to go and get a halfpenny-worth of sticking plaster—I went to get it, and she ran down Hoxton-square with my sister, took her own a court, and while I was gone she stripped her—an old clothes-woman as coming past, and she said, "There is a little baby down the court asked"—I ran, and it was my sister—I wrapped her in my pinafore, and book her home.

Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the children till I was taken up.

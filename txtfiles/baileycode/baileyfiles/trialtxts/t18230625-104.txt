            . I am a seaman
. My trowsers were on board the Winchelsea, which laid off Poplar


. The prisoner was a lumper
 on board - I missed them from the quarter deck, and found him behind the water cask, in the act of taking them off. He had them on under his own.

            . I took him in charge, with them on under his own.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He might as well swear to my jacket, for I bought these trowsers an hour before, for 3 s. 6 d. When he said he had lost a pair, I said I have bought a pair, and you shall have them if they are yours.

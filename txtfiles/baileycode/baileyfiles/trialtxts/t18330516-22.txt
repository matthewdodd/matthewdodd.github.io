. On the 21st of April I went out and left my shop secure, about half-past twelve o'clock - I had fastened my shop-door and the street-door likewise - I left no one at home but my children who were up stairs - I returned about a quarter to two the next morning; I found my doors ajar, and on going in I saw by the reflection of the gas-light the prisoner in the shop; I distinctly heard something fall from him - he attempted to get out but I stepped out and shut the street-door, shutting him in the passage - I called the police, and then went into the passage again, as I thought the prisoner might get out at the back- the policeman came in about ten minutes and took him - I found on the floor in the shop, a pair of Blucher-boots and two odd shoes which I had left in the window when I went out.
Prisoner. I was on the floor in the passage. Witness. He was in the shop when I first went in, and when I went into the passage again, I was struggling with the prisoner till the officer came.

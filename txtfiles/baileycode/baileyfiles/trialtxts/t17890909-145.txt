             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Royston, a linen-draper and haberdasher; I saw a hand take the handkerchiefs; they were in the window, in three quantities; I did not see the face; on Thursday week, between seven and eight at night, the prisoner and another girl came into the shop; and some other customers came in; she went out; and in the space of five or ten minutes, I saw a hand in the window; and this little girl, who was a customer in the shop, ran to the door, and said, that is her; I followed her and thrust her into a house, and I saw the handkerchiefs fall out of her apron; I took them out and gave them to the watchman.

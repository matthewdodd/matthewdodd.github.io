On 22nd Jan., I missed a 10l. note from a drawer in my bed-room, which I kept locked—I had not taken the number of it, but I knew it by a mark on the back—I had put it in the drawer on the Saturday before, and locked the drawer and kept the key in my pocket—I found it locked—in consequence of something the prisoner said, I went to her sister's at Dalston—when I cam back, I called her into the parlour—she said she was very sorry for what she had done, and if I would forgive her she would not do so any more—she said she had found the note in the shop—this is it (produced)—I know it by a name on the back—the prisoner was two years and a quarter with me—I had not suspected anything wron before.

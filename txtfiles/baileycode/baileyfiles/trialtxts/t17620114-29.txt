            . I am a gold-smith

, and live in Grub-street. The last time the prisoner worked for me was on St. Thomas's day. I, being summoned to attend the wardmote, weighed my stock of silver, which was 25 ounces odd penyweights. I did not come home till eleven at night. The next morning I weighed it again, and there were four ounces deficient. What I missed was cuttings and filings of buckles. My children observed to me he had been melting, and I had given him no orders to melt. I went to the chandler's shop, and found he had had some pearl ashes, we can't melt the silver in a body without them. Then I had recourse to an assay-maker, and there I found there had been an assay made in his name. Then I went to the refiner, and found he had bought an assay of silver from the prisoner, which was 23 ounces odd penyweights, for which he received 6 l 5 s. 4 d. Then I went to Mr. Curry, where the prisoner had worked, to give him a caution that he did not serve him the same. He told me he also missed a quantity. I got a warrant, and took up the prisoner. He gave no satisfactory account before my lord mayor how he came by the silver, and he was committed. He was searched, and in every one of his pockets were the remains of filings. He hardly worked one day in six or seven, yet never wanted money.

            . I took the prisoner up. I asked him if he had been selling silver. He denied selling that which Mr. Morland mentioned. I took him to Mr. Morland, and he gave a constable charge of him. He was searched, and his pockets turned insides out, and silver filings appeared on every one of them, both waistcoat and breeches.

            . I am an apprentice to a rope-maker, and live in Old-street. I sold the prisoner a pair of silver chapes and tongues; there was an oz. of them: he gave me five shillings for them. This is about eight weeks ago.

            . I am a journeyman cabinet-brass-founder, and live in Golden-lane. I sold the prisoner a pair of silver shoe-buckles, knee-buckles, stock-buckle, hat-buckle, and a pair of silver sleeve-buttons, and an odd bit or two of a serril of a came; there were between seven and eight ounces of it all. He gave me 4 s. 9 d. an ounce. The whole sum was 45 s. He weighed them at a pawnbroker's shop in Golden-lane.
He was asked divers times, if he had not made a mistake in either weight or price. He said, he had not.

            . As I was going along Cheapside


 on the 14th of December, about twelve at noon, I felt something at my pocket; I turned round and caught the prisoner with his hand in my pocket, drawing out my handkerchief. I took hold of him by the collar, then he dropt the handkerchief, and I picked it up; I took him before my Lord-mayor who committed him. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
Another boy took the handkerchief out and put it into my hand, I dropt it directly. I am a sailor
. I have been a year in a collier, at 12 s. a month. I have not been ashore but a week.

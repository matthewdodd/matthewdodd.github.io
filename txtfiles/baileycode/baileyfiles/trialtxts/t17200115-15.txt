            , of St. Martins in the Fields



, were indicted, the former for 


               feloniously stealing 3 Gold Rings, one Ring set with Stones, a Snuff Box value 6 d. and 5 pieces of Silver
            , the Goods of

            ; and Thomas Davenport as 


               Accessory for receiving the same, knowing them to be stole
            . It appeared that Selby was the Prosecutor's Servant
, and took the Goods and went away; that she gave them to Davenport; which she acknowledged on her Tryal, but said that Davenport knew not how she came by them. The Jury considering the matter 

               acquitted
             Davenport, and found Selby 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

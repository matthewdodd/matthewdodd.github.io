               stealing four Woman's Gowns, a Pair of Stays, &c
            . the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     Smith

                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



            . Please you, my Lord, my Cloaths were stole the last Day of February, between Seven and Eight o'Clock at Night.
Q. What Cloaths ?
Smith. Four Woman's Gowns, a Pair of Stays, two Quilted Petticoats, and other Things.
Q. Where were they taken?
Smith. Out of a Box in my Room.
Q. Where is your Room?
Smith. In Brewer-Street, at one Thompson's, a Peruke-maker. The Things were taken by Eleaner Bennet and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Smith 
               



            .
Q. What are these two Prisoners?
Smith. Sir, they pretend to be Quilters

; they pretend to go out to work. I know one of them, the other is Cousin to her; the biggest of them is 
               
                  Anne 
                  Smith 
               



            .
Q. How did they get into your Room?
Smith. There is an old Woman in the Neighbourhood I look after; I go about two Hours every Evening; while I was with her they got into my Room; I had the Key in my Pocket; whether I mislock'd it I cannot tell. When I came home I found my Box broke open; a Gown and a Shift were in the Box I found unlock'd.
Q. How did they contrive to open your Box?
Smith. That I cannot be Judge of; I had the Key of my Door in my Pocket, and the Keys of the Box likewise; but when I came home I found both open.
Q. How long was you out?
Smith. I was out from half an Hour after Six to Eight, as I am every Night, with the Gentlewoman I look after.

                  Anne 
                  Smith

                  Q.

            , Constable.) Where had you this Coat?

                  Smith 
               



            .

                  Q. 
               


            (to Hibard.) Is that the Coat you bought of

                  Smith

                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Sarah

                  Etty 
               



            .) What have you to say?
Etty. I have known 
               
                  Anne 
                  Smith 
               



            , my Lord, above a Year and half; she liv'd in Orange-Street; she has been backward and forward to my Apartment; I have often Things of other People's, but never found she wrong'd me. The other Prisoner stole two Hoods from me.
But most of the Things being found upon the Prisoners, or pawn'd by them, they were both found 

               guilty
            .

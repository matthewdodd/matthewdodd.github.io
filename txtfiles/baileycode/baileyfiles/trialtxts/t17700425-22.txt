            . I live at Chelsea


, and deal in haberdashery and linen
. I am not sure to the time I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; it was about the beginning of February. The prisoner had been in my shop, and had bid me money for the petticoat. She cheapened several things besides. She bought some gloves and some ribbons, and other odd things. I never observed her to take any thing after this. Mrs. Holmes came to my shop, and asked me if I missed any thing? saying, there were some things found that had my mark upon them, and the prisoner was suspected. I got a warrant and took her up. Mrs. Holmes brought the things laid in the indictment, to me; I am sure I never sold them to any body. They are my property. The prisoner confessed she took them away at different times, but never would tell me in what manner she took them.

            . I am a mantua-maker, and take in plain work. The prisoner brought these things to me to make up for her. She told me she bought them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am quite innocent of the fact.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the shop

            . On the 22d of August I followed the prisoner and two more from Newgate-street into Fenchurch-street - I there saw them close on Mr. Duff; I saw the prisoner tucking something under his coat - I crossed over and took this handkerchief from his hand and secured him - he endeavoured to throw it down.

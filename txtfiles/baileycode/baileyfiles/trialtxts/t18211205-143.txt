            . On Saturday, the 10th of November, I put this linen in a tub, wet, ready for the wash, and on Monday morning it was missed. Somebody had got over the wall: the wash-house was not locked. I also missed a table spoon. I afterwards found part of them at Queen-square.

            . I am an officer. On Monday morning the 12th of November, about 8 o'clock, I was informed the prisoner had gone into a dealer of marine stores' shop; I followed in the direction he had taken, and apprehended him in Charles-street, Westminster, and asked what was in his bundle: he said it belonged to his mother, and contained different things, but would give no account. I took himinto a public-house, and found it was wet linen, and found some more in his hat; he told the magistrate he picked it up in the park. I advertised it, and found the owner.

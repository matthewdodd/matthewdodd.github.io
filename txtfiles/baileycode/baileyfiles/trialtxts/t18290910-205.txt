             - he is a carman
. The prisoner was in his employ on the 15th of July - he received money to pay charges for Kennel coal, at the Docks; I gave him 2l. 5s. 6d. first, and then he sent home for 3l. more, which I sent him - he did not return; he was found by the officer about a month afterwards - he had been about seven or eight months in our employ.

            . The prisoner sent me from the London Docks


 to get 3l. more - I got it, and took it to him; he said he wanted 5l. 1s. 8 1/2d. to pay the charges, and he had not enough.

            . I took up the prisoner in Chequer-alley, on the 20th of 
               August.
             I told him I wanted him for Mr. Breedon's account - he said he was very sorry, he could not help it, some he had spent, and some he lost.

             re-examined. He paid part of this money at the Docks, the balance he kept - he sent me a note of what he had paid.

THOMAS LANE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of July, 17 yards of carpet, value 2l. 5s.; and 1 hearth-rug, 15s.; the goods of 



David Silvanus and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN DURRENT
. I am in the service of David Silvanus and another, of High-street, Whitechapel, and sell carpets. On the night of the 24th of July I was outside the shop, shutting it up—I saw a young man, whom I did not know, go into the shop, bring out this carpet, and give it into the prisoner's hand, who was standing near the door—I had seen them standing about the shop about a quarter of an hour—I ran after him—he dropped it, and ran up George-yard—I took it into the shop—this it it.

Prisoner. Q. Did you lose sight of me? A. Yes.





JAMES M'MICHEN
 (police-constable H 131.) I was on duty—I met the prisoner and another person, running as hard as they could up George-yard—I suspected, and said, "What have you been doing?"—the prisoner said, "I have done nothing, let me go"—I took him to the shop, and showed him to Durrent—I there received the carpet and rug of him.





JOHN FARMER
 (City police-constable, No. 655.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

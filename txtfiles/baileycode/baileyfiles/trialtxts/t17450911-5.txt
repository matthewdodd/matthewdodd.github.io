            . I keep a Toyshop in the Strand


, on the 9th of August the Prisoner came and asked to see some handkerchiefs, I shewed her some, and she was very difficult in choosing. I had a suspicion that she had got some under her apron, so I took hold of her with one hand and turned up her apron with the other, and under it were four silk handkerchiefs; she said, for God's sake, let me go, I told her I would not.

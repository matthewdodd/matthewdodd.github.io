. Aged 19.

MR. ASHBY. The prisoner was formerly in my service, and left me two

years ago—a female servant of mine, who kept up an acquaintance with him, invited him to the house, and he must have remained there, and then broken open the drawer where the money was kept—I have recovered nearly all the money—he left it with a publican in the Strand—I wish to recommend him to mercy on account of his youth, and the respectability of his father, who had lived for many years in the service of my late partner's widow, and is very much respected—he has promised to send him as an emigrant to Australia—he does not seem to be connected with thieves, and I am in hopes he may be reclaimed—he was discharged from our service for some petty theft—he is single.




Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am servant
 to Lady Isabella Finch. The prisoner lived with my Lady about three months and a week. We lost the things mentioned in the indictment at different times, but did not suspect her, but she staying out one night after we missed some things, we suspected her. She was kitchen maid
. All the things were missing in the time she was there. The table cloth and napkin were Lady Isabella's, the cotton stockings were Lady 
               
                  Charlotte 
                  Wentworth 
               



            's. I lost five shirts, and found but one of them. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Chapman 
               



            , wife of

                  Chapman 
               



            , was cook: she lost an apron and a pair of ruffles. The buckles were 
               
                  Lydia 
                  Howley 
               



            's. The prisoner lay out about the 30th of January. The next day being Saturday she came; I asked her where she had been: she said, she expected she should go away, and was come for her things. I then asked her about the things missing; she much denied having taken any thing, and wished very bad wishes; but at last she owned she had taken them, and that they were at Mr. Stockdale's, a pawnbroker. I went with her there, she owned to nothing that was there but the silver buckles, and one apron; the pawnbroker refused shewing any thing, but what she asked for. I threatened to go to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             for a warrant to search his shop; at last they brought a pair of stockings, my shirt, and the napkin: then the prisoner owned she pawned them at different times, and mentioned the money she had upon them. We let her go, on her promising to come again on the Wednesday, to let us know where every thing was that she had taken away: she not coming, I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             for a warrant, and on the Saturday she was taken, and carried before him on the Monday; there she did not deny taking the things, but owned to nothing but what we had found: we lost many more things, but I never found any more than what I mentioned.

                  Nash 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Stockdale, in Great Poultney-street: the prisoner pledged all the things mentioned in the indictment at our shop; the table-cloth the 9th of January, for 4 s. She said her name was 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Brown 
               



            , and that she lived in Long-ditch. (The goods produced and deposed to by Ainsworth, as the property of each person, as in the indictment.)
Ainsworth. This Nash is the person that would hardly give us an answer, and would not shew us the things, till I was forced to threaten to go to Sir

            .
Court. It is hoped the Legislature will take this business into consideration, and make it more penal; there are dreadful consequences from having such shops as these all over this great city. There is hardly a thief comes here but a pawnbroker comes to give evidence.

There was another indictment against her.

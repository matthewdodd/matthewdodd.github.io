GEORGE KING



, stealing 67 yards of calico, value 2l.; the goods of 



Thomas Radford.






THOMAS DAVIS
. I am warehouseman to Mr. Thomas Radford, of 69, Aldermanbury. On the evening of 19th July I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner with a piece of calico which I had seen safe on the counter ten minutes before—he was in the act of walking down stairs with it on his shoulder—I asked him what he was doing with it—he made no reply, but wished me to let him go—I gave him into custody—he must have walked up two flight of stairs from the street.





GEORGE CURTIS
 (City policeman, 166). The prisoner was given into my custody—he told me his mother had sent him out to get work; and if he could not get work, he was to go home with something—he told me he lived at 7, Starch-alley, Goswell-street—I went to the house; there was no such name there—I went a second time, when the prisoner had told me the name was King, and found it was his sister lived there.





GUILTY.

(The prisoner was further charged with having been before convicted.)





GEORGE LANGDON
 (policeman, N 27). I produce a certificate—(read: "Henry Williams, convicted at the Central Criminal Court, December, 1849, having been before convicted: 
Confined six months")—I had him in custody—he is the person.


GUILTY.** Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

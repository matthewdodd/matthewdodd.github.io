 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of December, 1 stool, value 2s. 9d.; 1 basket, value 10d.; the goods of 



Samuel Marston; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL MARSTON
. I live in St. John-street, and am a cooper. On the 12th of December, between six and seven o'clock, this stool was at the door, and the basket on the bench—the prisoner took them up, and went away with them—I followed and took him, twenty or thirty yards from the house—he was quite a stranger to me.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. He said at the office that the basket was in the shop, and the stool outside. Witness. It was outside.





ROBERT MARSTON
. I am the prosecutor's brother. The stool was removed from the door—I brought it back—I did not see it taken.





RICHARD BAYLIS
. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—I remember the trial—the prisoner was the person convicted—I was a witness against him, and am positive of him.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

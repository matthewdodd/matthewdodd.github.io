            . The Prisoner is a ticket porter
, and was employed to hook the tackle to the hogsheads. I saw him bring this out of a lighter, at Wiggins's key


: one of the hogsheads was broke, but I can't say who broke it. I asked him how he came by it, he said one of the coopers gave it him. I enquired of the coopers whether it was so, but they would not own it to be truth.
Q. Did they deny it?
Clack. They would not own it to be true. The Prisoner begged for God's sake that I would forgive him, and said that he never did any such thing before. And before the Alderman he said he found it.
Prisoner. I found it under the sheet of the lighter. 


               Guilty 10 d
            .

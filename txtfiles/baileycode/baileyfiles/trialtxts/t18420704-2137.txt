GEORGE PALLISER
. The prisoner was in my service—I thought it necessary to watch—I missed these seventeen dozen of buttons, and other things—I charged the prisoner with having taken them away—he said he had not—I took him into*the counting-house, and charged him again—he still

persisted he had not—I said to my son, "Go to his house, and search it and bring all that is there"—the prisoner then said, "They are not taken off your premises yet; I will tell you all about it"—he took me to the shop and pulled these articles out from under some shavings and hair—these are my property—these tufts were found at his house, and are also mine.





SAMUEL CHIVERS
. I am a policeman. I found these tufts between the mattress and the bed at the prisoner's house—I am sure it was his room—he took me there.

Prisoner's Defence. They were tied up with some trimmings, and sent home with some lining to my wife to make up.




GUILTY

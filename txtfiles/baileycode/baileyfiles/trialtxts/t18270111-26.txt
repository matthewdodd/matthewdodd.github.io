            . I live in Fenchurch-street


, and am a shoemaker
 - these shoes were in my window. On the 9th of December, about half-past four o'clock, my son rung the bell, hearing the glass break; it had been cracked for six months, but was secured with putty - I came down and found it broken in; I went out with my son, but notseeing the person, I came back, concealed myself behind the door, within two or three yards of the broken window, had the light put out, and in two minutes I saw the prisoner come and turn his back towards the glass which had been cut; he put his hand in - I instantly opened the door, and jumped upon him - he had then got the shoes out, and dropped them; he threw me into the kennel; I recovered myself, and we both ran, calling Stop thief! - I caught hold of his coat, and the tail came off in my hand; I secured him in the middle of Mincing-lane - the three shoes were picked up; they are worth 5s. - two pairs were taken.

JOSEPH BAXTER
. I am a carpenter, and have the care of some houses in Hyde Park-street, Paddington. On Sunday morning, the 11th of September, I was up at half-past six o'clock—I live at No. 12—I heard somebody

in No, 11 house—I stopped outside in the wood-yard, and saw somebody open the door—I could not see any body then—I shifted my position, and got against a gate that opens to the field—shortly after, the prisoner came out of No. 11—I stopped him, and accused him of having some property—he said he had nothing—I saw a bundle in his smock-frock—I clapped my hand to it, and said, "You have got something"—he put his hand in and pulled out a smoothing plane—he said that was all—I said, "You have something else"—he took out a saw, then a screwdriver, and these other things—I had locked the gate on the Saturday night, and the door was fastened with two pieces of wood inside—somebody must have got inside to take away the wood.





WILLIAM GLASCOCK
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and have the property.





WILLIAM FRANKLIN
. I am a carpenter, I was at work at No. 11—this plane is mine—I left it there on Saturday night.





RICHARD ROWED

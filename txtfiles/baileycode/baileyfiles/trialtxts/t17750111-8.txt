            . As I was passing through - Lane about six in the evening of the 31st of December last, I saw the prisoner and two persons with him standing at a chandler's shop; I thought they were about no good; the other two passed me, and I felt a motion at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I pursued the prisoner and overtook him; he had my handkerchief in his hand, but when I sezed him he threw it down: I felt my handkerchief not above two minutes before.
Prisoner's Defence.
Two chaps ran by me; one of them threw the handkerchief upon my face: I did not steal it.

1656. 




JOSEPH NEWCOMB
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



James Barelay, from his person.






JAMES BARCLAY
. I live in Copthall-court. On the morning of the

26th of June I was near the Custom House—I received information, and missed my handkerchief.





WILLIAM CHILDS
. I am beadle of Trinity-square. I saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor up Thames-street—when they got near the Custom House, a cart stood by the curb—they then rushed up, and the prisoner lifted up the prosecutor's pocket and took out his handkerchief—I ran up, and took him with it, tucked between his legs.

Prisoner. I picked up the handkerchief on the curb, and I was going to give it to the gentleman—It is very odd to me how the officer could see through the cart. Witness. I swear I saw him lift up the tail of the coat, and take the handkerchief out—I stooped down and saw him do it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

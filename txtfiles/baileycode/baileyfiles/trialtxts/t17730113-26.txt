            . I am a gentleman's servant
 out of place; I lodge in Exeter-street


; the prisoner, my brother, and I, all lay in the same bed; when I got up on Saturday morning I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and the prisoner was gone; my silk purse with the money was in my breeches pocket; the muslin neckcloth and waistcoat were put upon the drawers. The prisoner was taken the Tuesday after. My green purse, and my brother's neck-cloth and hat, were found upon him.

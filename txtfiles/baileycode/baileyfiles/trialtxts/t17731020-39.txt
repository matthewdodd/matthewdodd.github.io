                  Thomas
                   Blower
               



            . On the 9th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, as I was going between Wapping and Tower-hill, in East Smithfield, I met with 
               
                  Ann
                   Johnson
               



             and 
               
                  Susanna
                   Welsh
               



             in the street; they asked me to go and give them something to drink; after walking some way with them, I went with them into a room near Broad-street, East Smithfield


; there were three women in the room then; the third I believe to be 
               
                  Margaret
                   Creamer
               



            ; I am sure of the other two; I am not sure of her; there was a candle in the room; 
               
                  Susanna
                   Welsh
               



             came to me, and asked me for a shilling; I gave her one; I sat down upon a bed in the room with 
               
                  Ann
                   Johnson
               



            ; the candle was taken out of the room or put out; I was upon the bed with 
               
                  Ann
                   Johnson
               



            ; she took out of my breeches pocket a leather purse which contained thirteen guineas, two thirty-six shilling pieces, three pistoles, and a double pistole; I clapped my hand upon my pocket and missed my money: I was in liquor but not very drunk; I felt the purse in my pocket not half a minute before it was gone; I felt it when I was on the bed; she got from me immediately out of the room, and ran down stairs out of the house; I pursued her to the door but did not catch her; there were some people about the door; I called the watchman; he came and went up with me into the room where I had been, and there I found my hat; I went after her to the door without it. 
               
                  Ann
                   Johnson
               



             and 
               
                  Susanna
                   Welsh
               



             were taken the next day; I was not present; I saw them afterwards before Justice Sherwood; the purse was never found; two pistoles, two guineas and a half, and a gown and petticoat which they had bought, were produced at the Justice's; one of the pistoles had a remarkable thin edge; I took notice of it before; they are my pistoles.
Q. Do you know both of them or only one?
Blower. I am certain of one, and I believe the other is mine. I never saw Welsh after she went out for the beer.


                  Charles
                   Earle
               



            . I am one of the under beadles of Whitechapel parish. I was at the Court of Request the 10th of Sept. about eleven o'clock; a publican came in and said he had been at a house where he believed a robbery had been committed; I went and took 
               
                  Susanna
                   Welsh
               



             and a man with her; I told her I would detain her on suspicion of a robbery; she said she had been at work at Kent, a hopping, and had got two guineas; I asked her where she bought the petticoat; she said at the next door, which was a pawnbroker's; I went there and enquired what money she had changed there, and what money she had laid out; he said she gave sixteen shillings for the gown, and nine shillings for the petticoat, and changed one guinea; she said she gave sixteen shillings for the gown; I took Johnson about half an hour after; we searched Welsh but found nothing on her the first time; on a second search we found two guineas and a half sewed up in her petticoat we found nothing upon Johnson; pulling off Welsh's stockings the two pistoles fell out, which are produced in Court now; I have had them in my custody ever since.

                   Smith
               



             confirms Earle's evidence.

                   Mayland
               



             confirms Earle's and Smith's evidence.

                   Stripling
               



            . I am a watchman: I live just by where the robbery was committed; the prosecutor came to me to go and take the people; I went to the room but they were all gone; I found his hat there.
Johnson's Defence.
I never saw the man: they searched me seven or eight times; I have not a shoe to my foot; they tore my petticoat to pieces; they searched even my private parts, and used me very ill.
Welsh's Defence.
When I was taken Smith searched me and took my money from me that I worked hard for; the two pieces of gold were given me coming on the water, as I was coming up from Gravesend, by a sailor.

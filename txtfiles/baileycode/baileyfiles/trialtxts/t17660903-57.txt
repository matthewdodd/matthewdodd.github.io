            . I live in Spitalfields; I was got a little in liquor, and picked up the prisoner in Church-lane


; she took me up stairs at a person's house there, we went to bed together; I don't think we were in bed ten minutes; she got out of bed, and my breeches lay at the foot of the bed, and my money, the same as is mentioned in the indictment, was in a piece of paper in the pocket; she ran down stairs; I thought she would have come to bed again; I do not know whether she had any thing on or not; I had a suspicion she robbed me; I got up and felt in my pocket, and missed all my money; I ran down stairs, and Mr. Strong got some body to lay hold on her.
Q. Are you certain you had that money about you?
Evans. I had received it but a little before, and I felt it in my pocket just before I went up stairs.
Q. Did you make any bargain?
Evans. No, we made none at all.
Prisoner's defence.
He agreed to give me a guinea for bed and all; he had taken me to divers places; he gave me but a shilling, and I gave a sixpence out of that for the room; I had some money in my bosom, he said it was his money, but it was my own; I saved it up by degrees; it was but a guinea and a 5 s. 3 d.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately from the person

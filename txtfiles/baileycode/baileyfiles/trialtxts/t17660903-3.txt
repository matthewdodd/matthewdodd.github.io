            . I keep the Blue Boar-inn in Holbourn




; I missed my breeches, and had a suspicion of the prisoner, as my servant told me he was found in my stables; I got a search warrant, and went into his room at a barber's shop in Holbourn; this was on the 18th of August; there I found the knee-buckles, shirt, neckcloth, handkerchief, shoes, and silver table spoon; he was exposing the breeches to sale to a Jew; he had lived servant with me about three weeks or a month before.
Q. Where were these things taken from?
Jaques. The breeches were in a back parlour; I took the prisoner before Justice Welch, who committed him.
Prisoner's defence.
It was necessity that drove me to it.

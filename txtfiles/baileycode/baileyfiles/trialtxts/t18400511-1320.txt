 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

Harold John Holmes; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






HARLD JOHN HOLMES
. I keep the Turk's Head public-house, in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On the 15th of April the prisoner was at my house, and when she went out I suspected her and went after her—she had got five paces off—I asked her what she had been doing, and felt her side, and felt a pot under her clothes—I gate her into custody—this is my pot.

Prisoner's Defence. I was there all day, and in the evening I borrowed the pot to get a child a little water; in coming back a person beckoned me out; I was but two or three steps from the door, speaking to this woman; the prosecutor came out, and 1 said I had nothing belonging to him; he gave me into custody; the pot was under my apron; I had no thought of taking it.





HAROLD JOHN HOLMES
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the same person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

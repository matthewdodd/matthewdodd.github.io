WILLIAM ERNEST BENNETT
. I live in Westminster, and keep a chandler's shop. On the 1st of January, about half-past five o'clock, I missed a piece of bacon from a board in my shop—it had been safe about five minutes before—I believe this to be the piece—(looking at it)—it was produced to me the next morning—I identified it then, but it is considerably altered in its appearance now.





ROBERT HARMAN
 (police-constable B 66.) I saw the prisoner running along the Broadway, Westminster, on the 1st of January—I knew him—Ifollowed and stopped him—I found this bacon on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought it of a man in the street, for 1s. 10d.





WILLIAM GLASS
 (police-constable C 127.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the clerk of the peace-office, Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

             was indicted for

, a watch, value 5l. a key, value 6d. and a piece of ribbon, value 1d. the property of 
                     
                        William 
                        Church
                     




                  , from his person

                  CHURCH
               



            . I lost my watch on the 13th of August, between one and two o'clock at night, in Piccadilly


. I was going along talking to a woman named 
               
                  Caroline 
                  Marshall
               



            , and Connor came up and said she would go with me for six-pence. I went with her up the court, and was talking to her for about a minute, and she drew the watch but of my pocket. I said, damn you, madam, you have got my watch. She went away; I went after her, and she shifted it from her right hand to her left, and then gave it to Rymer. That is all I know of it; I never found the watch again.


                  CAROLINE 
                  MARSHALL
               



            . I was walking with this young man, and he told me he would give me a sixpence, and I told him I would not do any thing of the kind. He went with Mary Connor; she handed his watch to Rymer, and she gave it to some of the other girls.

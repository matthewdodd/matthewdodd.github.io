ANN ELIZABETH EARNSHAW
 and 




EMMA WELLS
 were again indicted for

 stealing 1 locket, value 12s. 6d. the goods of 



George Lamb.


MR. BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






JAMES REARDON
, assistant to Mr. Fleming, pawnbroker, Farringdon-street.

Between three and four o'clock on Saturday afternon, the 17th of Feb., Wells came to our shop—there are two entrances, one into the boxes, and one into the fore part of the shop—there is a passage which runs into the boxes and into the street—she pawned this gold locket for 8s.





WILLIAM BUTLER
. I am assistant to George Lamb, jeweller, 69, Cheapside. I have seen the prisoners at our shop; the last time was on the 17th of Feb., I think, between one and two o'clock—I received some communication from an officer—this locket now produced is ours—the prisoners had been looking at lockets—Earnshaw had desired to see them.

COURT. Q. Had they bought anything? A. No—when they came they asked to see lockets, which I showed them—the excuse they made for not buying was, one was too large and another too small for the miniature they wanted it for—Earnshaw spoke of the miniature.





ANDREW LYNN
. I am servant to Mrs. Rose. On Saturday, the 17th of Feb., by her direction, I followed the prisoners to Mr. Fleming's shop—they both went up the steps—I then left them, to give information.
(Rev. John Wilson; Theophilus Carrington; Robert Wright, of Hull; William Hughes, Stationer, Park-street, Camden-town; William Robson,

grocer, High-street, Camden-town; William Pitt, baker, Park-street, Camden-town; and Mary Ward; gave both the prisoners good characters.)

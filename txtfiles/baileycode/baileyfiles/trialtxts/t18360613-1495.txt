1495. 




JANE JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of May, 1 pail, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



Richard Bushell, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






DANIEL SANDERS
. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Great Arthur-street, Golden-lane. On Sunday, the 22nd of May, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Bushell's house, in Little Arthur-street, between five and six o'clock in the morning—she had nothing in her hand—she came out in about a minute and a half with a pail—I ran up the street, and stopped her with the pail—I took it from her, and took her back to Mr. Bushell's—I asked her why she did it—she made no answer at first, but the second time she said she did it to get her a lodging.





RICHARD BUSHELL
. On the 22nd of May, Saunders brought the

prisoner to my house, with the pail, which is here—I know it is mine—I had seen it safe five minutes before, in the back yard.





THOMAS MALIN
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody that morning—she said she had taken the pail from want, and did not care what became of her.





WILLIAM WOODWARD
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the peace, for Middlesex (read)—I was present at her trial, and had taken her into custody—she is the person—she—was tried in the name of Venning.
Prisoner. I was in great distress.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Life.

            . - Mr. Knapp. I believe you are what they call an apprentice to the moniers - A. Yes.
Q. Was the prisoner one of the persons that brought back the trays - A. Yes; some of the trays he brought back.
MR. PARKER - Mr. Reynolds. Was you at the Tower on this day - A. I was, on the 23rd of July; in consequence of what I heard my suspicion fell on the prisoner; I was determined to watch him at the finishing of the work that day; he went down the mint, towards the stone kitchen; the moment he turned down the stone kitchen he ran very fast; I was obliged to run very fast to get sight of him; he run very fast till he got into the Minories; I followed him into Whitechapel, attended by Bishop the officer; there we took him and put him into an Hackney coach; I told him we took him on suspicion that he had been robbing the mint; he said he could not help it; I then asked him if he had got any pieces of money about him that they had been coining that day; he said, no, he had not; Bishop searched him, took off his shoes and hat; we could not find any thing of that sort about him at that time; I then desired him to take him to the office, Worship street; while Armstrong and I went to search his house.

            . Q. You are an officer of the police office, Worship street - A. I am. I apprehended the prisoner, in company with Mr. Parker, at the bottom of the Minories; we put him into a coach; he was searched there, and nothing was found at that time; we took him to the office in Worship street, I, in company with Vickrey, to a private room; we made him take off his clothes; I took his breeches up by the knees and shook them; I said to the prisoner, something rattles; he replied it is only my buttons; on searching the back part of the waistband of his breeches I found four pieces of coin wrapped up in a piece of paper; I gave them to Vickrey and proceeded searching him, and found nothing else.
Q. When you were in the coach with him did you tell him what he was charged with - A. Yes; he was asked if he had any pieces about him; he said he had none; we afterwards found them.

            . Q. You were present when Bishop brought him to the office - A. Yes; he said take him up stairs and search him; I saw Bishop shake his breeches; when they fell on the ground, I said there is something in them; the prisoner said it is nothing but the buttons; in this bit of paper there were four pieces of coin, it was not in a pocket, it was in a place cut behind in the waistband.
Q. to Fletcher. Were these four pieces stamped at the same time - A. Yes, they were made from the same dye; they are perfect coin, they are called bank tokens.
MR. MOSELY. - Mr. Knapp. You are a magistrate of Middlesex and belong to the office in Worship street - A. I do.
Q. The prisoner was examined by you - A. Yes.
Q. Was that examination taken by you - A. It was. It is in my own hand writing and signed by me; it was taken from the prisoner's own mouth.
COURT. There was no promise made to him, was there, or did you threaten him to induce him to confess - A. No.
The Confession of the Prisoner.
"I acknowledge that I took the four pieces from the mint room where I worked on Saturday; they were afterwards found in the waistband of my breeches; they are the pieces that I so took; I never took but one before."

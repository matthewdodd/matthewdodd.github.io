            . I live in Swallow-street, and am a brazier
. I can only say the copper is my property. I saw it taken from off the prisoner's head.

            . About a quarter before five in the afternoon, on the 19th of January, just before I came to Mr. Strutton's door, I saw two men take up this copper and weighed it in their hands, and put it down again. I crossed the way, thinking the copper was about going. There happened to come a dray by. I looked over the horses and saw the prisoner come up to them and put it on his head and walked along with it. I called down Mr. Strutton's cellar and told them three men had got the copper, and were going off with it. His man, named Newman, and I ran after them, and came up with the prisoner in John-street. We brought the prisoner back with the copper, and Mr. Strutton met us when the prisoner had it on his head.
Newman confirmed the account he had given.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming along Swallow-street; there were two men offered me a shilling to carry the copper to King-street, Seven Dials. I had not got three hundred yards before they came and laid hold of me. I looked round and the two gentlemen were gone.

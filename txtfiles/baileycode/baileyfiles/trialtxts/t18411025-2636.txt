WILLIAM BRADFORD
. I keep a boot and shoe shop in Kingsland-road. On the morning of the 8th of October I left my shop to call on a neighbour—I returned in ten minutes—I saw a vacancy in the window, and missed four pairs of boots—the policeman afterwards showed these boots to me—these now produced are them.





ROBERT QUINLAY
 (police-constable N 240.) About nine o'clock that morning, I saw the prisoners at the corner of a street, half a mile from the prosecutor's—Gill approached me in a very daring manner, and I saw some boots under her shawl—the other two were crossing the road—I called to them to stop, and come to me—they came, and I said to them, "I want all three of you"—they walked before me to the station—I found two pairs of boots on Gill, and one pair on each of the other two—I took them to the prosecutor, and he identified the shoes.

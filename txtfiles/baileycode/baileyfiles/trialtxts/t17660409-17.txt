: on Saturday the 1st of March, the prisoner came into my shop to sell some waste paper; when he was gone out, Mr. Thomson, who was in my back room, told me he saw him take a pair of stockings; he and I went and brought him back, and he had the stockings in his possession, (produced and deposed to.)

            . I was with Mr. Saunders in a back room, the prisoner came into the shop with a parcel of paper to sell; Mr. Saunders put it into the scale, and as he turned his back the prisoner took a pair of stockings from off the counter and put them into his pocket; when he was gone I told Mr. Saunders of it. We went after him, and took him in the street and brought him back; then he took out these stockings and put them on the counter.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of it; my handkerchief was out of my pocket, and perhaps I might make a mistake.

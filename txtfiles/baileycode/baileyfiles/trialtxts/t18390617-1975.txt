WILLIAM MAYBIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of a man unknown, from his person.






GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) On the 20th of May I was at Greenwich fair about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, and saw two gentlemen passing—the prisoner and another were following behind them—I saw the prisoner put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and take out this handkerchief—I seized him, and took it out of his hand, and told the gentleman—he wanted me to give him the handkerchief back—I asked him his name and address—he would not give me his name; but his friend gave me the name of "S. Ward, Knight Ryder-street, Doctors Commons"—I have been there—his friend lives there; but he refused to give me the name of the person who was robbed—it remains unknown to me—I found another silk handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket, with the mark of "M. Y. Z." on it.





WILLIAM CHING
 (police-constable N 61.) I was in the fair—I noticed the prisoner, and saw him take the handkerchief—my brother constable seized him, and took it from his hand—it was claimed by the gentleman—the prisoner said he had made a mistake, it was not his hand that was in the pocket.

Prisoner. The gentleman did not claim the handkerchief—he was intoxicated. Witness. He was sober—he said he had lost his handkerchief, and that was his.

Prisoner. It was quite dark—I was walking along—Kemp came and said, "Where did you get this handkerchief?"—I said, "It was thrown on my shoulder."





GEORGE KEMP
. It was clenched in his hand—and it was no sooner out of the man's pocket than I took him.

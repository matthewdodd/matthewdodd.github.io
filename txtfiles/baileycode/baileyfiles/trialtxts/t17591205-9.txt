                  Bailey 
               



            . I am servant to Mr 
               
                  Edward 
                  Gray 
               



            , who had three or four hundred deal boards for scaffolding at buildings that he was about; there was one in Bloomsbury Square: I know the boards mentioned in the indictment are Mr. Gray's property, but it is impossible to say where they were taken from; I have seen them.
Q. Where did you see them?
Bailey. I saw them at a chandler's shop in Parker's Lane, the latter end of October; they had been used for scaffolding.
Q. What is the man's name where you saw them?
Bailey. His name is Wright; it is not far from Bloomsbury Square.
Q. How many boards did you see there?
Bailey. I believe I saw nine there, but there were but six of Mr. Gray's, which were ten or twelve foot long; some mark'd T.G. and some E.G. which is his father's name. When the prisoner was before justice Welch, he asked him how he came to take the boards away? He replied, they were old boards, and but of little use.
Q. When was this?
Bailey. This was about five or six weeks ago.
Q. Can you tell whether they were boards belonging to the scaffold ?
Bailey. I cannot tell whether they were fixed or lying loose; we have many lying loose on the scaffold; this I know, they were scaffolding boards, and my master Mr. Gray's property.

                  Wright 
               



            . I bought the boards of the prisoner at the bar.
Q. Where do you live?
Wright. I live in Parker's Lane, and keep a chandler's shop. A labourer who lodged at my house told me these boards were the property of Mr. Gray. Then I sent for Mr. Bailey, who came, and said they were his master's.
Q. How came you by them?
Wright. I believe I bought them of the prisoner at the bar, who brought them to me by two at a time.
Q. At what time of the night did he bring them?
Wright. He brought them between seven and eight at night.
Q. Did you ask him how he came by them?
Wright. No, I did not the first time.
Q. Did you the second ?
Wright. No.
Q. Did you know him before?
Wright. No; the second parcel that he brought I found were marked; then I inquired about them; the first two parcels were fit for nothing but to burn. He told me they were old flooring board, which he had from a house where he was at work.
Q to Bailey. What sort of boards were they, new or old?
Bailey. Some of them had been but little used.
Q. to Wright. What did you give for them?
Wright. I gave a groat a piece for them.
Q. to Bailey. What are they worth a piece?
Bailey. They are worth 14 d. one with another.
Prisoner's Defence.
I thought they were all old flooring boards.

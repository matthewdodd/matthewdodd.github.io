            . I am a brush-maker. On the 25th of October I saw the prisoner, in company with another, at Brandenburgh House


. I saw the other take a watch from a gentleman's pocket and hand it to the prisoner, who ran off with it. I called Stop thief! and as he ran he threw the watch into the river. There was a number of thieves there. I was struck, and my life was in danger.

            . I was with Dorrell, and saw the other man draw a watch from the gentleman's pocket and give it to the prisoner - we followed him. The gang was so strong we did not like to take him. I went for assistance, and on returning found he was secured.

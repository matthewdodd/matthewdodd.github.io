            . I am servant to Mr. Bellamy. ironmonger
, on the 6th of Nov. the prisoner and 2 other coopers came to our shop, and asked for 12 papers of nails, in the name of Mr. Humphreys, their master; I weighted 96 pounds, they each took 32 pounds, and they carried them away, they all 3 said the nails were for Mr. Humpherys's. Mr. Humphreys is a sugar cooper, and has nails of us. Just as they were gone Mr. Humpherys's man came in and told me they were all 3 discharged from his master.

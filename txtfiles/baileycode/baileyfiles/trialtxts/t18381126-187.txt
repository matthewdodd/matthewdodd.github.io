ELIZABETH COFFIN

and four o'clock, I hung out a table-cover, a silk handkerchief, and two pair of stockings, in my garden, at the back of my house—I saw them there safe at four o'clock, and missed them a little after five.





JAMES LANCASTER
. (police-constable T 60.) The prisoners were given into my custody a little after six o'clock, on the 29th of November, at the house of Mr. Pocock—I found the table-cover tied round Richardson's neck, like a handkerchief, and the silk handkerchief round Johnson's—they were not dry—the stockings were given to me in Mr. Pocock's house, next morning.





FREDERICK WILLIAM TAYLOB
. I saw some stockings in Mr. Poeoek's kitchen, one was lying on the chair in which Richardson was sitting—they did not belong to the house—they had been brought there.

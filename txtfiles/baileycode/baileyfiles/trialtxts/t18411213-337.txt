THOMAS HOWELL
. I live at Dolly's Chop-house. On the afternoon of the 7th of December, about four o'clock, I was going up Ludgate-hill—I felt something—I turned round, and my handkerchief was gone—the prisoner was near me—I taxed him with it—a friend who was with me, took off his hat, and it was not there—my friend then put his hand into his pocket, and took out my handkerchief in my presence.





LEONARD BLADON
. I searched the prisoner in the presence of the prosecutor, and found this handkerchief in his pocket.





EDWARD KNIGHT
 (City police-constable, No. 361.) I took the prisoner—I found these two false curls in his hat.

Prisoner's Defence. I was looking into a picture-shop, and the gentlemen came and spoke to me, and found the handkerchief on my arm—it was not in my pocket—one of them struck me, and knocked me down, and kicked me.





GEORGE PORTSMOUTH
 (police-constable E 117.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.

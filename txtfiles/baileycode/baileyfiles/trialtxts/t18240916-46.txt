                  THOMAS 
                  DELANEY
               



            . In June last year I and my deceased brother Michael lodged at the prisoner's house, in Cloth-fair


; my brother slept in the first floor back room. One Sunday morning, between three and four o'clock, I was in bed in the front garret, and heard my brother's voice down stairs, crying murder - I jumped out of bed, and ran down stairs, and in the passage I saw Hussey and his wife striking my brother - the prisoner, on seeing me, up with his fist, and knocked me down; Gannon, who was there, brought my brother up stairs, in less than two minutes, into the front garret - I followed him up, and on getting him into the room bolted the door - my brother was sitting on the bed, undressing, when I went in: I told him to take off his clothes, and go to bed, and we would leave the house as soon as the night was over. About ten minutes after I got into the room Hussey gave a blow with a hammer at the door, which opened, and he struck my brother with it on the left side of his head, over his eye, and knocked him down; he was on the bed, nearest to the door.
Q. After he entered the room did anything happen before he struck him - A. No, my brother said nothing to him, nor did anything; he only kneeled down, and was bleeding. The prisoner then came and made a third blow at me - I grasped at the hammer to prevent the blow: we were struggling in the room for ten minutes, and then both got into the passage, struggling for the hammer. The watchman was on the landing place. Hussey pushed me, and knocked me down, put his knee on my chest, and kicked me - he then let go of the hammer. When I saw my brother bleeding I was senseless, and do not know whether I gave Hussey in charge or not. I took the hammer into the street, and whether I gave it to the watchman or not I do not know. Hussey gave charge of me - I went to the watch-house. I had seen the hammer before; it was kept in the shop.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You camedown hearing your brother crying murder, how many others were crying out also - A. None. Gannon, M'Grath, and one Gallaghan were present, also Hussey and his wife - I do not know who else; there were six in all I think. I saw the watchman coming in when I went up stairs. It was ten minutes before Hussey came up to my room. My brother died on the Tuesday morning, about four o'clock. When my brother heard the blow at the room door he stood up - he was taking off his shoes; he had only taken his jacket off: he sat on the bed, and began undressing directly we took him up stairs; he had nothing in his hand.
Q. Was there an iron rod in the room - A. I do not know; I never saw it. I was in the Compter all Sunday; Hussey was at liberty. I saw no marks, or blood upon Hussey. I did not beat him - if there was any blood on him it was mine.
Q. I ask you one question, and tell you I have a witness to call - have you ever said,
"I do not know that Hussey did strike my brother first; but I will swear it, for I think it no harm to be revenged on him" - A. No, nor anything like it to any person. I know Conway, but said nothing of the kind to him.
Q. Have you ever said that if Hussey's friends would give you 10 l., you would go home, or to harvest, till this trial was over - A. No; I never said so to Green, nor that as they would do nothing I would do all I could against him, and give Green 2 l. to swear against him. I never spoke to him.

                  GANNON
               



            . I am a labourer. 1 June, 1823, I lodged at the prisoner's house, and slept in the back garret - there are two beds in the room. I and Grogan slept in one, and two men in the other. This happened on a Saturday night; I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; all were in good humour then, drinking in the kitchen - 
               
                  Michael 
                  Delaney
               



             was one of the party; I left him down stairs when I went to bed. I locked my room door, and was disturbed between three and four o'clock, by Turvey, who called me up; it was day-light: I went down, and on the landing found the prisoner, the deceased, his brother, the prisoner's wife, and two or three others, who I do not recollect; they were pulling and mawling one another about. Mrs. Hussey sang out to me to take 
               
                  Michael 
                  Delaney
               



             up stairs to prevent the quarrel; I laid hold of him, and got him and his brother out of the mob, with a great deal of trouble, up to the first turn of the stairs. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Delaney
               



             broke down under my arm, and went down - he wanted to go down again. I took Michael up to his room, but could not get in there, so I took him up to his brother's bed-room, and locked the door. One Galaghan who slept in the room was there also M'Grath - they were not in bed. I asked Michael to go to bed; he was very much intoxicated, and wanted to go down again, and said he would not go to sleep till he could be revenged on Hussey.
Q. Mind what you say, remember you have given an account of this before which is in writing. - A. I will mind; his brother came up, I knew is voice, and let him in, he locked the door. Catherine, the servant, came up after that, and told us all to go bed, for the watchman had entered the house, and if we did not, he would take us into custody; I went to bed then without opening the door to her. 
               
                  Tom 
                  Delaney
               



             stood at the head of the bed in his small clothes and shirt. I heard the door broken open in five or six minutes, and when I turned round, I saw that the deceased was on the floor bleeding, and Hussey in the room; he and 
               
                  Tom 
                  Delaney
               



             had both hold of each other; the watchman was in the passage, and both gave charge of each other. I saw nothing in Hussey's hand; I did not see him enter the room: the first thing I saw when I turned round in bed, was the deceased on the floor; I suppose he was knocked down, but I did not see him knocked down; the watchman took 
               
                  Tom 
                  Delaney
               



             into custody, the prisoner came back into the room, and I saw him kick the deceased either on his legs or thigh while he was on the floor. I got out of bed, and then the watchman came in and took Hussey away.
Q. Did Hussey say any thing when he kicked the deceased - A. He said there never was a man reared from his father that he would not serve in the same way. M'Grath (who is now in the hospital,) took the deceased into Mrs. Turvey's room, she attended to him; he was in a very bad state indeed, and said he should never get over it; the room was stained with blood; I observed a cut on his temple - I left the house directly.
Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you first set down to drink that night. - A. Between ten and eleven I think - the two Delaneys and a few more of the lodgers were with us; I went to bed in about an hour; I suppose they continued there four hours after. When I came down, Mrs. Hussey begged of me to take the deceased up stairs, that there might be no more quarrelling, he was very violent, and so were every one of them; they were all in a great passion. 
               
                  Tom 
                  Delaney
               



             was as much inclined to fight as any of them, but he came up of his own accord afterward. I don't think one of them was sober. The deceased passion did not cool at all, when he got up stairs, and Hussey's passion seemed to continue. I saw an iron curtain rod in the room; I saw it in the deceased hand; he was doing nothing with it. I was sober when I first went down - Hussey was bleeding in the mouth. 
               
                  Tom 
                  Delany
               



             was down before me; the watchman came up with Hussey; I heard the door burst open; I could see the door from my bed, but my face was to the wall.
Q. What time passed between your hearing the door burst open and seeing Hussey in the room - A. Not three minutes; and I saw the watchman directly I turned round in bed; my bed was near to where he fell.
COURT. Q. Had the deceased the iron rod in his hand when the prisoner came into the room. - A. I cannot say my Lord.
ALEXANDER M'CROMBIE. I am a watchman. I was on duty on Saturday night in June, in New-street; my attention was called to the prisoner's house by a woman who lives there. I went, and saw three or four men, one on the top of the other on the passage floor. I endeavoured to separate them as well as I could; the landlord Hussey gave charge of one man, whom I took to the watch-house; Hussey accompanied me there; we returned to the house, the constable of the night and one or two watchmen came to my assistance. Hussey then came out of a little room with a hammer in his hand and went up stairs - we followed him up, and the first room he came to he burst open with the hammer; he looked in and said nothing, but wentup to a room on the second floor, and burst that open, looked in, came out, and went up to the third floor, burst the door open with the hammer, and went in, but did not stop any time, and I did not go in (I said
"Do not break the doors open, you should not do that;" he said the house is mine, and I can do as I please with it; this was while he was breaking the second door) he came out, and the deceased's brother and him were struggling, and fell down on the landing-place; we separated them, and took both down.
Q. At this time did you know anything of what had happened in the room - A. No; we took them to the watch-house, and were going to take them to the compter, they wanted some clothes; I returned to the house, went up to the same room, and found a quantity of blood.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You and the other watchmen followed him up - A. Yes, close behind, he knew we were following him. I did not observe his mouth and face.

            . I was an officer on duty on this night, and took the hammer from 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Delaney
               



            , between the house and the watch-house.
MR. R. A. STAFFORD. I was house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on Sunday the 15th of June, 1823, about five o'clock in the morning, when he was brought in. I found his scull fractured on the left side - it was about an inch long and one deep - he was sensible; he died on Tuesday morning. His death was occasioned by inflammation of the brain caused by the fracture; that could be produced by this hammer. I think from the external appearance of the wound that the sharp edge of the hammer had done it.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Might not the wound be occasioned by falling against the foot of a bedstead - A. I think not. I do not think that the force of falling would do it; the inflammation would certainly be increased by intoxication.
Prisoner's Defence. The deceased and I were on good terms. I did not intend to do him any harm. I bore him no malice at all.

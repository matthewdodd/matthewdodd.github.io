            . The things mentioned in the indictment were taken from out of a two pair of stairs room on the 26th of March. The prisoner was taken and carried before the justice; he acknowledged the taking them, fell on his knees, and begged I would forgive him.
Q. Did he live in your house?
Watts No; he is a stranger to me.

            . I lodge at Mr. Watts's; I met the prisoner with the things in a bundle coming down stairs; I asked him what he had there, knowing he did not belong to the house? he answered, they did not belong to me. I laid hold of him, but he gave me a shove and ran away with the things; I called out stop him, and ran after him, and he was stopped near Russel-Court. I heard him own he took them.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

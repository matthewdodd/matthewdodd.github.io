                  , privately from the person of the said Reynold

                   Davis
               



            . I bought a watch of Mr. Vulliamy, in November 1773, and in January last was 12 month, the day that the parliament met; I am positive that I had my watch about me when I got into a crowd by the door of the House of Lords


; I had been in this crowd about a quarter of an hour, when I got out of the crowd I missed my watch; I went to Mr. Vulliamy's in Pall-Mall, of whom I bought it, to enquire how to proceed. I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and then an advertisement was put in the news papers; but I heard nothing of it till about a month or five weeks ago, when I had a note from Sir John Fielding's clerk, to call at the office, which I did; there I saw the prisoner, and my watch was produced; Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             asked the prisoner how he came by the watch; he declared he bought it six years ago in New England.
Wm Halliburton. About the 18th of last January, the prisoner was taken up for another offence, I searched him and found this watch upon him; he said I had no occasion to take it for he had bought it in New England some years ago. I took him before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , the books were examined, and it seemed to answer the description of Mr. Davis's watch: Mr. Davis attended; the watch was produced, he said it was very much like his watch, but he could not swear to it as the name and number was altered. The prisoner was present at this time and said, he bought this watch six years before at Boston in New England. I went to Mr. Vulliamy's, he examined his books and before he took the watch to pieces, he said, if it was made by him he should find an inside mark, he took it to pieces and the inside number of the watch answered to the number in his book.
Justin Vulliamy. About a month ago, Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, man shewed me the watch to see whether it was what I sold to Mr. Davis in November 1773. A day or two after Halliburton came, I said the watch had all the appearance of that I sold to Mr. Davis, but the name was filled out on the cock; at first the plate was very thin where the name and number were; it appears to have been filled; if so it is still thinner, and there is another name and number engraved upon the same plate; the new number 710, but the original was J. Gray, 813; I put the name of Gray because it was a second sort of watch; I don't put my name but upon the better sort; in order to be sure whether this was the same watch or not; I said, I would look upon the inside, upon which we usually scratch the number before we send it the workman. I took the watch to pieces and found the mark I made myself upon the inside the same as the number in my book; it was entered in my book by this number as sold to Mr. Davis. I am as certain as I can be of any thing that it was the watch I sold to Mr. Davis. I don't rely merely on these figures, the watch is my own making, and I know it from the work itself, watchmakers know their own work.
Prisoner's Defence.
As to the evidence Halliburton has given, it is entirely false, I never said I had the watch in my possession six years, I have had it 22 months, or there about; what was said at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's was this, that I brought this watch after I came from Boston in New England. I bought it at Portsmouth of the mate of a ship.




               Guilty of stealing the watch, but not guilty of stealing it privately from the person

            . I am in the service of 
               
                  Sanderson 
                  Turner Sturtevant
               



            . I lost a livery coat, a hat, and a silver band, of my master's, and two coats, two pairs of small clothes, and other things of my own; part of them were in a box, and part on the balustrade - they were safe at twelve o'clock, and were gone at two. On the Wednesday or Thursday, about half-past one o'clock, I took the prisoner in the coach-house - he had a pair of small clothes, a shirt, and a neck-cloth of mine on; I said, "They are my property;" he made no answer - the rest of the property I have not seen.

            . I was sent for, and found the prisoner in custody - the witness identified these things, which the prisoner then had on.

            . I am Dixon's servant. On the 6th of December, about half-past three o'clock, I was going to milk the cows, and saw the prisoner get over a gate into a field where this gander and a goose were; I went on, and got the milk; I heard the goose and gander make a noise - I ran to the gate, the prisoner got over, and I saw him driving them - I got over, and when I got to the corner of the hedge the goose was there, and the gander was gone; I saw the prisoner on the other side the hedge, with the gander under his arm; I said, "You good for nothing villian, I will follow you to the devil, while you have got my goose" - he then dropped it; it was alive, but it died soon after.

            . On the Sunday afternoon I heard the witness calling, and went up; the prisoner was running out of the field, where he had dropped the gander - he went down Ealing, and was taken the same evening; I am sure he is the person.

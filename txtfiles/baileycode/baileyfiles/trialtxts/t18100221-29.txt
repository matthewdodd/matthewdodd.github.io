            , and John Fassett Burnett; these gentlemen are distiller



s at Vauxhall.
Q. When did this happen - A. On the 1st of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going to the Swan inn, Holborn-hill.
Q. What had you in the cart - A. I had twenty-four casks of different sizes in the waggon, all containing spirits and vinegar. I missed the cask in Fleet-market


; it must be taken out going along. I only stopped just coming down the bridge, which we must do when we are heavy loaded to unchain the wheel; the cask I missed contained five gallons of brandy. It was afterwards found.

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of February, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, I was standing, in company with Eldridge. under a gateway going into Union-court, Holborn-hill; the prisoner passed us with a cask on his shoulder; we followed him a little way up the court and asked him what he had got; he said he had a cask of vinegar, he brought it from the Borough, he was going to take it to Tottenham-court-road to his master; we told him he was going the wrong direction to Tottenham-court-road, we must look at it; I took the cask off his shoulder and Eldridge took hold of him; I looked upon the head of the cask and found there was a permit on it; I then said he must go along with us, I was sure he had not come by it honestly; I took it into a public house in Fleet market, and found it contained brandy; we took him to the Poultry compter, I found out by the permit that it belonged to Messrs. Burnett and Co; I went to them the next morning. The cask is here.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Westminsterbridge, and when I came to the foot of Blackfriars bridge there was a person said he would give me two shillings to carry it to Charles-street, Hatton Garden; I never said I was going to Tottenham-court-road.

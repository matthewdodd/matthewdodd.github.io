ELIZABETH COVENTRY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of June, 1 shawl, value 3s.; and 1 cap, 6d.; the goods of 



Louisa Day: 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Thomas Day: 1 gown, value 4s.; 1 bonnet, 2s.; and 1 cap, 6d.; the goods of 



Hannah Day; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






LOUISA DAY
. I live at Harefield. On the 23rd of June the prisoner came to my father's, and said she was out of employ, and had just come out of the Union to get work—my mother told her to mind the child—I gave her some victuals, and she said she would look after my child—we were all at work—

she brought my child to me next day, between eleven and twelve, and went away with the things stated—I missed a shawl and cap of my own—these now produced are them.





THOMAS DAY
. The prisoner came to my father's house last Thursday week—when the things were missed I went after her, and overtook her—she had on this bonnet, shawl, and gown.





HANNAH DAY
. This bonnet and gown is mine. I never gave them to the prisoner, or authorised her to take them—they were in my bedroom.





JOHN TURNER
 (police-constable D 39.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

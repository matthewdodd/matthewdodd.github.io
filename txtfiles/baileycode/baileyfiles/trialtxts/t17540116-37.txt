            . On the 12th of December I met with the prisoner at the bar, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Welch 
               



            , between twelve and one, at the corner of Prince's-street. I went with them to a house in Hedge-lane


, and in a room up stairs 
               
                  Grace 
                  Riley 
               



             and I were upon the bed. She got off the bed, and I immediately clapping my hand down to my breeches, missed my watch. I ran down stairs, but she was got off; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Welch 
               



             was in the room all the time. I desired the watchman to see if he could find out the prisoner, and on Christmas-day he came and told me he had got one of them in the Round-house. I went and found Welch, whom I took before Justice Cox, and he committed her.
Q. When had you your watch last?
Collins. I remember it being in my pocket after I was in the room with them.


                  Mary 
                  Welch 
               



            . I and 
               
                  Grace 
                  Riley 
               



             were standing together. The prosecutor came, and speaking to us, we went with him to a house in Hedge-lane, where he paid sixpence for the use of a room. We were together, and upon his asking if we would have a pint of wine, the prisoner went down for it. After this he clapped down his hand, and said he had lost his watch; he went down and told the woman that he had lost his watch. A watchman then came in, and they went to see for the prisoner to take her up.


                  William 
                  Gee 
               



            . I am constable, and apprehended the prisoner. He produces a gold watch with the chains and seals, which the prosecutor deposed to as his property, which he lost that night.


                  John 
                  Rabit 
               



            . On Wednesday the 12th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, my wife brought this watch, as it is, to me while in bed; but I thought it not honestly come by, and so delivered it to the constable.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Rabit 
               



            . I am wife to the last evidence. The prisoner brought that watch to me that night, and I delivered it to my husband. She had it in her bosom.
Prisoner's Defence.
This girl and I live at Rabit's house. We went out just by the Haymarket one night, and as I was sitting with two or three more girls, she went up to the prosecutor. After they had had some talk, we went all three together to a house. When we came there he asked if we had such a thing as rods? I went down and asked the gentlewoman if she had any, and she had a whisk. After that he desired me to lie down on the bed with him, and the other girl and he asking me to go down for a pint of wine, when I came up again, there lay the watch on the bed, and his breeches were down.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately from his person
            .

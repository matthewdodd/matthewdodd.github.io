JOHN BALLAM
. I am journeyman to Mr. William Birnie. On the 19th of Jan. I was in the bakehouse, and heard my mistress call—I ran up, ran out, and saw the prisoner running with the till under his arm—a witness stopped him—I came up and found the till on him—it was my master's, and there were pence, halfpence, and farthings in it.





WILLIAM DENNIS
. I stopped the prisoner with the till under his arm—he was running as fast as he could—I asked where he got it—he said some boy brought it out of the shop and put it on bis head—I did not see any one but him.





JANET BIRNIE
. This is my son's till—his name is William Birnie—I saw it safe that morning, and it contained pence, halfpence, and farthings.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, a young man stopped me, and said, "Here is a box, you may have what is in it;" I was going along, and a gentleman stopped me; this lady said she saw me in the shop; I was never in it in my life.





WILLIAM HIGH
 (police-constable K 242.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

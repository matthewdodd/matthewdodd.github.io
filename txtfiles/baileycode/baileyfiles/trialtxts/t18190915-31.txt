            . On the 30th, of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Lower Thames-street


. I saw a handkerchief lying on the pavement, which I picked up, not knowing it was mine; I gave it to a person just by, and afterwards found it was my own. I was not aware that my pocket had been picked.

            . On the 30th of July, I was going down Lower Thames-street, and saw the prisoner standing in company with another man. I suspected him, and saw both following the prosecutor; in less than a minute his companion took a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner. I immediately seized him, and he dropped it. The prosecutor thought it was mine in the bustle, but immediately claimed it himself.

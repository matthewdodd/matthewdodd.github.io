            . I am coachman to Mr. 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Forrester 
               



            : on the 30th of March I had been out, and upon coming home I miss'd the bridles out of the stable; this was at the Bull and Gate-yard


: upon enquiring of the ostlers and coachmen in the yard, I observed the prisoner stood peeping out of another stable; the under-ostler and I examined him, and in that stable we found the bridles hid under some hay under the manger; we charged him with taking them; he owned he had taken them: he was a stranger, he did not belong to the yard.

            . I am a saddle-maker, and live in Gray's-lnn-lane: the day before the prisoner was taken he brought an old saddle to me, and said his master had given it him; I gave him 5 s. for it, the value of it, (produced and deposed to, as the prosecutor's property.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

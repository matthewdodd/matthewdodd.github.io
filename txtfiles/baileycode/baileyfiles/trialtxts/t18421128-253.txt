253. 




MARY TOOMEY
 and 




MARY MAHONEY
 were again indicted

for stealing, on the 
5th of Nov., 2 sheets, value 2s., the goods of 



William Hoile.






ELEANOR HOILE
. I am the wife of William Hoile. The prisoners took furnished lodgings of me—they left two weeks rent in debt—this sheet is mine—here is my work—it is made into a chemise now.





SARAH HARE
. I am searcher at the station—I found this shift on Mahoney—she told me she made it in Ireland.

Toomey's Defence. On Friday morning we went out, and in our absence she took our bed-things out of the press, and took what we bad bought for ourselves; we stopped there till the next morning; I declare the sheets were left in the press when we went out; this is done out of spite.

Mahoney's Defence. It is through spite because I gave some water to a woman in the house; she took our things in our absence; we went in and lay on the boards till the morning, and she said nothing about the sheet.

TOOMEY*—


GUILTY
. Aged 27.—MAHONEY*—


GUILTY
. Aged 25—





Transported for Seven Years.

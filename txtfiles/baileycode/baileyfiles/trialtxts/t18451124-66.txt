 for stealing 561bs. weight of plums value 1l.; and 1 box, 4d., the goods of

ALEXANDER WEST
. I keep an eating-house in Church-lane, Whitechapel. On the 25th of Oct. the prisoner came in and asked for some pudding—as he was going out I observed a box of plums under his arm—I called to him to drop it, which he did on the threshold of the door—the plums were mine—they were worth 1l.

Prisoner. Q. Was I drunk or sober? A. cannot say—you did not make me any answer.





ELIZABETH WEST
. I served the prisoner with the pudding—I heard my husband say, "Drop it," and he dropped it—I saw the plums under his arm—it was half-past twelve o'clock at night.





EDWARD BURGESS
 (police-constable H 198.) I took the prisoner at a public-house in Wentworth-street—I suppose there were fifty thieves round him.

Prisoner. He fetched the prosecutor in the morning; I said, "Where are the plums?" he said they were used; I said, "Was 1 drunk or sober?" and they did not say.




GUILTY
.† Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

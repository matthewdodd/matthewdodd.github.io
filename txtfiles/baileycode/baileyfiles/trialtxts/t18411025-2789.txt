2789. 




DAVID LUDLOW
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of October, 2 spades, value 2s., the goods of 



Joseph Christian Hurst; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL HENRY HURST
. I live with my father, Joseph Christian Hurst, at Camberwell. On the 1st of October I had two spades, which I put into the shed—I missed them on Monday, the 3rd—these produced are them.






JAMES GAZE
. On Sunday, the 2nd of October, I slept in a cart with the prisoner, and between one and two o'clock in the morning he wanted me to go over into a garden with him—I would not, and he struck me in the mouth—he then went, and in a few minutes he brought back these spades, and put them under some dung by the side of the cart—the next morning I pawned them for 1s. each—I gave him the money—he bought some bread, and gave me part of it.





THOMAS PRITCHARD
 (police-constable P 167.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the Clerk of the Peace of Surrey—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . On the 5th of September, as I was crossing over by St. Clement's church, in the Strand


, about seven o'clock, I heard a noise, turned round, and the officer came and told me my handkerchief was gone; I had it in my pocket about five minutes before - I did not feel it taken; the officer and the prisoner were on the ground - my handkerchief was taken from the prisoner's pocket.

            . I saw the prosecutor in the Strand, and the prisoner following him - I followed them into Pickett-street, and saw the prisoner take up the tail of the prosecutor's coat; I caught hold of him, and called to the prosecutor to come back - the prisoner and I had a tussle together; the prisoner threw me down - a man standing by assisted me, and took this handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket.
Prisoner. This man came and said, "You must come, you are the principal person to come against him"- and then he said he would come. Witness. I took hold of him as soon as he lifted up the tail of the gentleman's coat.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a scuffle, and went to see what was the matter - they did not know who it was that picked the pocket; a man struck me on the head, and then they said it was me.

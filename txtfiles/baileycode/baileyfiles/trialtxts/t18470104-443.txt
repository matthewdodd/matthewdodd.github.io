JOHN WITTY



was indicated for stealing 12 cigars, value 6d. the goods of 



Henry Baker: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARIA BAKER.
 I am the wife of Henry Baker. On the 3rd of Jan. I was in the parlour, in the act of putting the tea-pot on the stove, and I saw the prisoner through the window taking the cigars from the glass-case in the shop—I am sure he is the person—I don't know whether I had seen him before—I think I have, but I will not be positive.

Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate "I knew the prisoner well by sight"? A. I could not be positive—I saw him take the cigars out of the case—I called "Stop thief." And he ran away—I did not run after him, as I was afraid to leave my shop—he got away and was taken in half an hour, but he got away again and was not taken till after eleven o'clock at night.





JOHN SQUIRES
 (police-constable M 134.) I took the prisoner in charge—he said he would not go—his companions urged him to get away, and he got away.

Prisoner. I knew myself innocent; I did not like to be locked up all

night; I have witness to prove that I was not the person; Mr. Squires knows the bar-man where I was; I was not near the house.





WILLIAM MARKNICK
 (City police-constable, No. 370.) produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court, by the name of John Williams—(read—Convicted the 30th of March, 1846, and confined nine months)—the prisoner is the person—I am quite sure.




GUILTY. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             the 15th of November
 last. It appear'd by the Evidence that the Prisoner was Servant
 in the House of the Prosecutors Landlord, and that the Perfume-pot,&c. was taken from off an Escrutore in the Prosecutors Chamber, and being broken to pieces was offered to sale to a Goldsmith, who stopped it, gave notice to the Prosecutor. The Prisoner in her defence pleaded, that she going into the Cellar to fetch Coals, the Silver catch'd hold of her Coat, and she looking found it half covered with Earth, and thinking it had been a thing buried there that belong'd to no body in the House, she thought she had as much right to it as any body else: But this plea did not avail, but that the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10d.

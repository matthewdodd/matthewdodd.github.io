SAMUEL WILLIAMS



, stealing 1 coat, value 1l. 10s.; the goods of 



George Watson, his master; having been before convicted.






CHARLES FARRON
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker, in North-place, Gray's-inn-road. I produce a coat, pawned by the prisoner on 21st Jan., between two and four o'clock—I took it in.





GEORGE WATSON
. I am a cab-proprietor. The prisoner had been a stable-man in my service—about one o'clock in the afternoon of 18th Jan., I left my stable in John's Mews, Bedford-row, leaving this coat in the middle room, by the side of the stable—it is mine—the prisoner was present when I hung it up—he kept a key of that room—I went to my stable about seven that evening, and again about twelve, and again next morning—the prisoner was not there—he ought to have been—I burst the door open, and the coat was gone—I afterwards saw the prisoner—I told him he had acted very wrong to me—I kept him talking about half an hour, till I met a policeman, and gave him in charge—he said he had acted very wrong, and if I would take him back he would pay me for it.





WILLIAM PEACOCK
 (policeman, E 85.) I took the prisoner—he said he took the coat, and told me where it was pawned—this is it.





JOHN RANDALL
 (policeman, E 26.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's

former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Oct., 1845, having been before convicted, confined one year)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

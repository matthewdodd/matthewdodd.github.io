SAMUEL IND
. I live in Devonshire-terrace, Devonshire-street, St. Dunstan's. On the 28th of April I was crossing Greenwich-park towards Blackheath—the prisoner came up to me and asked the time—I said, "Twenty-five minutes to one"—I had a watch with a ribbon and key—I took it out to look, and I put it into my fob—he turned round twice—I suspected he meant no good, and I turned to the road—he turned and said again, "What time is it?"—I told him again, and he snatched at my guard—it broke, and then he snatched at my ribbon, and took it with the key, and two rings—he went towards the gate of the park—I followed him and had him taken, and they were found on him.





AARON OUTRED
 (police-constable R 128.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I went up and took the prisoner—I found a ribbon, a key, and two rings in his pocket, which the prosecutor claimed.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Ten Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

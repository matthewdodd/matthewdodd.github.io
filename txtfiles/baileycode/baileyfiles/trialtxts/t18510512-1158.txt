HBNRT WEBB
 (City-policeman, 258). On 30th April, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners in company in Aldersgate-street—Smith was close behind Batty, and I saw Batty put his hand into a man's pocket and partly draw this handkerchief out—I stepped forwards and spoke to Baun—Batty crossed the road, putting the handkerchief into his pocket—I ran and took him, and Bonn took Smith.

Smith. Q. Where was the gentleman? A. In front of Batty—there were not many people about—I was at the corner of a court.





JOSEPH BAUN
. I was with Webb, and saw Batty take the handkerchief; Smith was behind him—I took Webb, and afterwards went to the gentleman and asked him, in Smith's presence, whether he had lost anything—he said, "Yes"—I took Smith—the gentleman came part of the way to the station—Batty resisted very much, and the gentleman escaped.

Smith. Q. Was not I looking into a window? A. Yes; there were not many people about—I should expect you stood behind Batty, to cover him.

Smith's Defence. I am innocent; it is not likely if I had robbed the gentleman I should have stopped there.

SMITH—


GUILTY
. † Aged 19.—



Confined Twelve Months.

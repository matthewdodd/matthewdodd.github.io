SARAH BARNETT
 and 




SARAH BARTON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
8th of July, 7 handkerchiefs, value 7s.; the goods of 



Edwin Foxwell; and that Barton had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD FOXWELL
. I live in Judd-street. At seven o'clock in the evening, on the 8th of July, I had seven handkerchiefs outside the door—I missed them at a quarter after seven—the two prisoners were taken—I have examined these handkerchiefs—they are mine, and have my private marks on them.





THOMAS TOWNSHEND
. I was in Judd-street on this evening, and saw the two prisoners twenty or thirty yards before I got up to 'them—I saw the ends of the handkerchiefs hanging from underneath Barton's shawl, and when I got up she dropped them—a young man who was following them from the shop, said, "You see that?"—I said "Yes"—we went as far as New St. Poncras church before we saw a policeman—Barnett said, "You can't prove any thing against us, because you don't know who dropped them."





JOHN COWTON
 (police-constable E 96.) I heard Barton say to Barnett, "We shall get over this," and Barnett said, "They cannot transport us for this."

Barton's Defence. I was walking down Judd-street; the man came and asked me to go back to the shop; I said I would not; then he turned round and said, "Here they are; the tall one dropped them; you are not the first one we have transported; we will transport you if we can."





WILLIAM ARCHER
 (police-sergeant L 7.) I produce a certificate of Barton's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

BARNETT—

.

BARTON*—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Mr. Austin. I am a gangsman: on the 18th of November, between the hours of 2 and 3, I called who would work. The prisoner was standing on the quays; he ran towards me with other people; most of them wore tickets. I said, the tickets would work before the others. About 15 minutes after I saw him in our half story; he stooped and picked up something; he had his trowsers under his arm. I said, what have you got here? I felt and found sugar in them. I took him to the Cock and Anchor to the rest of our people, and examined his trowsers, and found about twenty pounds of sugar in them (produced in court). Then he said he took it from a hogshead: I found the head of it was broke in.
Prisoner's defence.
The sugar that was taken from me, was given to me by a ship-mate.

                  HENRY 
                  HEBBERT
               



            . I am a linen-draper, and live in the Strand. I received an order from India for these articles, and gave it to Griffin to execute; I saw the goods about the 14th or 15th of February, 1826, when they were finished; I paid for them, and had nothing to do with them afterwards - they were to be sent to India; I saw some goods at Alcock's, in Little Britain, about a month ago, but cannot recognize them - the order came to about 90l.; there were more goods than these: these came to between 30l. and 40l. - the whole have been returned from India.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What is the amount of the whole order? A. Between 400l. and 500l.; but I shipped 400l. worth by another vessel.

                  FREDERICK ALCOCK
               



            . I am a refiner, and live in Cox's-court, Little Britain. About the latter end of February 1826, the prisoner Scott came to my counting-house, with a brown paper parcel, containing broken silver plate; it appeared to be new plate broken in pieces - I afterwards put them together, and they formed two dishes with handles; he offered them for sale - I asked where he got it; he said it belonged to a friend, who requested him to bring it for sale - I said, from its appearance, I thought it was not properly came by, and requested to know who his friend was, and where he lived; he said he did not know his name, or where he lived, but he occasionally called at his house - I said it was extraordinary he should undertake to sell plate of that description, for a man he had no little knowledge of; he said he had known him many years, though he could not tell his name, and he expected to see him again in the evening of the day, and was then to give him the proceeds of the plate - I said, I had no doubt it was stolen, and should detain it, and he must send his friend to give a proper account of it; he said he was sure it was all right, and I had better give it him back - I refused; he went away, for the purpose of sending his friend, but before that, I took his name and address, which he said was, "James Scott, a weigher
 at the Custom-house, No. 10, Harwich-place, Wellclose-squars;" that was about ten or eleven o'clock; he returned between three and four in the afternoon, said he had seen his friend, and told him what I had stated - that he found it not convenient to call then, but would call next morning - I let him go away, as he produced his deputation from the Custom-house, to show me what he had said was correct - I did not see him again till he was apprehended - Saltonstall came next morning alone, and said he called respecting the plate which Scott had brought - I asked if he was the owner; he said, Yes - I asked how he came by it; he said he bought it of a foreigner, and gave 15l. for it - I asked how it came in that state; he said it had been taken out of a fire abroad; it was discoloured, by having been put into a fire, which had not heat enough to melt it; it appears to have been cut up; the solder about it had run; if it had been injured in a fire, there was no necessity to cut it up: it would still be a complete dish, fit for use; the solder might have separated the handle and border; it was cut into about fifty pieces; it would certainly sell better without being cut - I said his account could not be correct, as the plate was English manufacture, and one piece bore the Goldsmiths'-hall mark, for that year; I asked if he was in the habit of buying plate; he said not particularly, but he bought any thing he could get a shilling by - I said, under all circumstances, I did not think proper to return the plate, but should take it to the Lord Mayor, and state the case, and if he ordered it, I should not object to give it him; he said it was giving me a good deal of trouble, I had better give it him back, and have done with it - I refused, and he appointed to meet me at the Mansion-house the next day - I went, but neither he nor Scott appeared - I saw nothing more of them, till they were taken; the plate is worth about 18l. in its present state; they have never been for it - I saw them in custody early in this month - I cannot be mistaken in their persons - the plate appeared to have been recently manufactured; it had the maker's initials, and the hall mark for that year.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did Scott come to you three times? A. No, twice; he was to receive the money, if I had bought it.
Q. Did he not say his landlady would enable him to find the person? A. No - I stated my suspicion to him the first time he came - I was satisfied when he showed me his deputation.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Saltonstall came but once? A. No; he was about a quarter of an hour with me; his features were familiar to me, though I could not recollect who he was - I am certain I had seen him before; it was eighteen months before I saw him again - I am quite certain of him - I have not inquired whetherScott's address is correct. I succeeded Messrs. Cox and Co. in business.
Q. Is it likely a man would bring plate to you, if he had come dishonestly by it? A. Not if he knew what he was about; there are a variety of places where he could dispose of it more easily; it is not impossible for a foreigner to sell English plate - I understood him, that the foreigner had said it came from a fire; if I had come by plate honestly, I should not object to go to the Mansion-house; it has been in my custody ever since - weighers at the Custom-house do not come in contact with foreigners particularly.
MR. BARRY. Q. Was it understood that Scott should send the man to you, whom he had it from? A. Yes - I had then done with Scott; he did not call about it afterwards - I advertised the plate; it was not claimed for some time - Mr. Griffin saw it at the office.


                  WILLIAM 
                  GRIFFIN
               



            . I am a silversmith, and live in Cornhill. In 1826, I had an order from Mr. Hebbert, to make some plate, to go abroad - I was living with my brother, who is a manufacturer - I took it down to the Custom-house myself, and entered it for Calcutta - I believe it was to go by the Duke of Bedford; we receive a drawback of 1s. 6d. an oz. at the Custom-house; after it is weighed by the inspector, it is left in the Searcher's office, for the lightermen; an inspector from the Hall attends at the Custom-house; it was manufactured at Sheffield; there were two silver dishes and covers, two warmers, and four egg-cups, in the box which I took to the Custom-house - I saw them before I packed them - I saw this plate at the Mansion-house, when the prisoners were there; this appears to be the bottoms of the dishes; the edges were shells and gadroons, and these correspond - I left it to go by Aldridge's lighter - Barker, his clerk, was at the Custom-house when it was examined.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see it delivered to him? A. No; it was left in the Searcher's office; it receives the Hall mark at Sheffield; all manufactured plate is marked; shells and gadroons are common - I do not swear to the plate.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever take plate to the Custom-house before? A. Yes; we always leave it in the Searcher's office - I think it was in February that I took it; it was in a deal box, with a tin lining fastened at the four corners: but it was opened at the Custom-house, then soldered down, and would not be opened again.


                  SAMUEL 
                  WALKER
               



            . I am a silversmith, and live in Beaufort-buildings. The dishes and covers were made at my manufactory, at Sheffield - I saw the plate at Lambeth-street; the letter "I," which was the Sheffield-hall mark for that year, was on some of the pieces, and there are the initials S. and C. Y. for "Samuel and Charles Young and Co.," who made it for me at Sheffield, in 1826, for Griffin's order - I have no doubt of its being the same - I delivered it about the middle of February.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you afterwards see it advertised? A. No - I manufactured about 120 ozs. - I know these articles by the pattern - I can swear there was not another pair of dishes made by us that year of that pattern; we call it the Waterloo border, which is common; but we are the only persons who manufacture that handle; it was a new pattern made about that time - I cannot say how many we have made.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Is the hall mark different in Sheffield and London? A. I believe so; it is sent down from the Stamp-office every year - I will swear these handles have been made by us; I think no one else has this pattern, but will not swear that; I can swear to our mark; every body would know that was the maker's initials - it still remains on the plate.
Q. Between January, 1826, and the middle of February, was there time for plate marked with the letter of that year, to go abroad and come back? A. It might have gone to France or Holland; I had no more handles made of this pattern; I have no doubt it is the plate.


                  THOMAS 
                  BARKER
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Aldridge, a lighterman
. I attended Mr. Griffin at the Custom-house; when this plate was brought it was deposited in the Searcher's-office, and was afterwards put into our lighter - we got a receipt from the commanding-office of the Duke of Bedford for it, as delivered in good order; I gave the receipt up to the broker, who gave me a bill of lading. It was to go to India.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. It was put into your lighter? A. Yes; I was not on board when it was put in, but I made out a receipt for it, and must have seen it in the regular course of things. I know a box with that direction was put on board.
Q. Can you swear that it was put on board, or do you swear from having the receipt? A. Yes; I got the receipt - no other parcel was shipped by the same party: we generally take plate on board as late as we can, not wishing to have it on board longer than we can help. We never open the packages.


                  JOHN 
                  SHORT BRINDLEY
               



            . I am a ship-broker. Thomas Stevens is owner and captain of the Duke of Bedford.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. When did she sail? A. She left Portsmouth in March; she was in the river in February, and was at Gravesend three or four days. I was on board at Portsmouth, and heard no complaint of a robbery.


                  SAMUEL 
                  MILLER
               



            . I am an officer. I apprehended Saltonstall on the 8th of this month, going up with a barge, off St. Katherine's Dock - he was acting as lighterman
. I charged him at the office on suspicion of stealing some plate from a barge going to an Indiaman - he said he knew nothing of it. Next day I took Scott, on board a foreign ship, acting as a Custom-house officer; I told him it was for taking some silver to Alcock's - he said he took a brown paper parcel - that he did not know exactly what was in it, but he believed it was old silver; he said he got it from a person, but did not know his name.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you know that he was a Custom-house officer? A. No doubt of it; I have known him for seven years, by sight.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had you been looking for Saltonstall before you found him? A. About three days. I saw no advertisement about the plate.
ROBERT DAVIS. I am an officer, and was with Miller when he apprehended the prisoners. I heard Scott say he took a brown paper parcel, containing silver, to Alcock's - that is all.

Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. That is all then? A. I heard nothing more; I did not hear every thing that was said.
SCOTT'S Defence. The brown paper parcel that I took belonged to my landlady; she asked me to take a small parcel of old silver, and directed me where to sell it; Mr. Alcock asked if I could produce the person it belonged to; I said I thought I could, and in an hour I went back to the landlady, and told her; she went out, returned, and said the person was gone to Deptford, but on his return no doubt he would call - I went and told Alcock so.
SCOTT - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 45.
SALTONSTALL - 

               GUILTY

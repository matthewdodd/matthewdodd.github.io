            . This cow was taken from a farm yard at Feltham


 - I saw it safe on the 4th of January, and it was missed on the following morning; I found it at William Farmer's - I knew it to be my father's; I do not know the prisoner.

            . I live about three miles from Feltham; I buy cows and other things. The prisoner brought this cow to me on the Saturday morning, about half-past seven o'clock; I was not at home, but he asked my wife if I did not buy cows - she said Yes, and sent him to me; he asked me 6l. for the cow - I bought it of him for 3l. 10s.; I told him to bring it into my yard, and asked him where he got it - he said he brought it from Hanworth, and his name was Willis; I went there, but no such person was known - I had the cow cried, and I saw the prisoner again, when he was taken into custody, about the pigs.

, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening - a person told me my pocket was picked; I missed my handkerchief, which I had felt safe about a minute before; I saw the prisoner run down Coventry-street and Oxendon-street - he was taken at the King's-mews; the handkerchief has not been found.

            . I was in Coventry-street, and my attention was drawn to the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner and another close behind him - I kept close behind them; the prisoner took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's right-hand pocket and ran - I pursued; he dropped it - I took it up and still pursued; the personwho was with the prisoner came behind me and took the handkerchief from my hand; he then knocked my hat off, but I still pursued the prisoner, and he was taken near the King's-mews.

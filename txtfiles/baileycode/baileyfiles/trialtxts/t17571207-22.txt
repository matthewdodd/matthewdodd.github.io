            . I am a linen-draper
, and live near Ratcliff-Cross


. The prisoner came into my shop on the 21st of November, about eleven o'clock in the day we were then very busy. She look'd at some linen, but never ask'd the price of any; she staid about ten minutes, and then went out of the shop I having a suspicion of her, followed her about fifty yard and od upon her a piece of Irish linen, she had it in her hand, which she put behind her, under her long red cloak. ( Produced in court, and deposed to.) I took her before justice Berry, and he committed her.
John Powel. I am servant to the prosecutor; I did not see the prisoner in the shop, but I saw her as she was going out, and saw my master bring her back with the piece of cloth.
The headborough deposed the cloth was deliver'd into his custody, where it had been ever since.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not bring any of my friends here, because I did not know when my trial would come on.

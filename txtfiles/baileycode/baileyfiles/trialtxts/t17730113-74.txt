            . I am coachman to Mr. Letton: I went with my master and his lady and set them down at the play; I came home about half after six; I locked up the box coat in the stable; I put the key in at a little hole in at the side of the window in the stable; I went there again about two hours after, in order to fetch my master; then I missed the coat: the key had dropped down from the place where I put it. I suspected the prisoner, as he had been about there; I had employed him to assist me as he was out of place; I did not tell my master of it that night; I told him the next morning of it. I went down to Westminster to look for the prisoner, I left word there that I wanted him; a soldier brought him to me at five o'clock on Tuesday night; the coat was stole on the Monday night; he acknowledged he took the coat, and said he would shew me where it was; he went with me to Plaid the pawnbroker's, where the coat was found pawned by 
               
                  William
                   Hoppington

            , on Monday the fourth of January for 5 s. 3 d. (The coat produced and deposed to.)

            . I pawned it on Monday night for the prisoner.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

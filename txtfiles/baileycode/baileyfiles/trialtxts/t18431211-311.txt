RICHARD FRANCIS
. I am in the service of Elizabeth Parmenter, a widow. On the 1st of Dec. we had 134lbs. of bones safe at her place—I missed them—to the best of my knowledge these now produced are them—they are worth 3s. 6d.





JAMES PERCY
 (police-sergeant S 144.) I saw the prisoners come from the prosecutor's premises with two bags of bones—I stopped them in Maiden-lane—they said they bought them at Highgate—they dropped them, and Carrington made his escape—I took him on the following Monday—he said at first that he picked them up, then that he bought them, and then that they came from the Veterinary College.

Powell's Defence. We bought them of two countrymen, at Highgate, for 1s.





HASTINGS MOORE
 (police-constable N 29.) I produce a certifiacate of carrington's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

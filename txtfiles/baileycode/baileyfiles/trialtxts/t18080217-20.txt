Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. No.
Q. Where is your house. - A. No. 24, Shoemaker-row, Blackfriers


; I rent the whole of the house. About one o'clock I was below stairs, I heard a noise at the door; I went to the door, I saw the prisoner, I asked her who she wanted and whether she wanted a lodger; she said, yes; I had one lady in the house; the prisoner had been up stairs.
Q. Had you seen her in the house before. - A. No, I never saw her before; she said she wanted a lodger; I had some suspicion she did not; I called the lady down and asked her if she knew the person; she said, no, in the prisoner's hearing. I saw something tied up in her apron; she said, they were her own things.
Q. Did you look at them to see if that account was true. - A. At last I got a view of them.
Q. What things were there. - A. Three shirts, a table cloth, two handkerchiefs, a pillow case, an apron, a pair of breeches, and a morning gown.
Q. When you saw these things did you know whose they were. - A. Yes, they belonged to my husband, I had seen the things about five minutes before, they were in the garret: I went for a constable; she begged of me to let her go.
Q. You did not see her in the house yourself did you. - A. I saw her in the passage, she must have come in when the door was left open; she thought it might be so again.

Q. Were you acquainted with her. - A. Not at all.

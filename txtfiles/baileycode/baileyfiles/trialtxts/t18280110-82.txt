CHRISTOPHER CHARLES FOSTER. I rent a house, No. 29, Watney-street, St. George's in the East


, but did not live there on the 13th of December: it was my house, but unoccupied; I had left a copper there the beginning of May - I had seen it safe about two months ago, in the back kitchen.

            . I am a clerk at the West India Docks. On the morning of the 13th of December I was standing at my door, which is the next house to this, at a quarter to seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner come out with a copper - a woman was with him - I ran after him, and said, "Halloo, you thief!" he threw the copper at me, and ran off - I struck him with a boot which I had in my hand, and pursued - I overtook him, and knocked him down - the woman came up - he got up - I still pursued, and took him again: I saw the copper compared with the place - it fitted exactly.

            . I am an officer, and received the prisoner in charge. This bunch of skeleton-keys was picked up on the spot where the prisoner was knocked down - one of them has a little blood on it; the prisoner was bleeding at the mouth.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I did not come out of the house.

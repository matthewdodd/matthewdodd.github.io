Prisoner's Defence. I had gone to Hammersmith to seek for work the day before - I called on one Mr. Slater, who gave me 6 d., but would not employ me; I went to a Mr. Watkins, and I then had some beer; a young man then came in and said to me "There is a joint of mutton for you" - it was wrapped up in an apron; I was going down the lane and was stopped: I had not been in Mr. Lamb's shop.

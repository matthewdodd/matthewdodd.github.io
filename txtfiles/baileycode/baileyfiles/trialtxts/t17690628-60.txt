            . I live in East-Smithfield


: the prisoner is my apprentice
. He called me up the 15th of June in the morning, and asked me if I had left my compting-house window open; saying it was open. I went and missed fourteen guineas. I had left it in a bason, covered with a paper, on the table. I had a susspicion of him, and charged him with it: he denied it for three hours, but afterwards he acknowledged the fact, and produced nine guineas of it. He is but seventeen years old. I only charge him in the indictment with one guinea.
Prisoner. I own I am guilty. I happened to see the money lie there, and I took it.

            . I am an ironmonger and brazier
, and live on Holbourn-hill


. On the 24th of January, between two and three o'clock, I was at dinner; and a man calling out that a woman was gone away with a stove, I and my apprentice went out after her, and my apprentice stopped her as she was turning into Shoe-lane: I was by: it was the prisoner, who begged my pardon, and said she hoped I would let her go: she strove to get from me, but I held her till a constable came.
Q. Where did she take it from?
Walker. She took it from under the window in the street. It was a Bath stove; I believe above half a hundred weight.

            . I was in the street, and saw the woman stealing Mr. Walker's stove; I called to them, and they ran after and took her.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Walker. I ran after the prisoner and took the stove from her: it is my master's property.
Prisoner's defence.
I never saw the stove till I saw it in Shoe-lane.

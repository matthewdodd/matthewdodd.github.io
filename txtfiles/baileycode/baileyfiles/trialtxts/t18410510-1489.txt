1489. 




JAMES JERROME,



 REUBEN WILSON
, and 




HENRY RUBIDGE
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
1st of May, 25 cheroots, value 1s. 6d.; and 2 cigars, value 2d., the goods of 



Mary Ann Bonner.






FREDERICK OWEN PITTOCK
. I am nephew to Mary Ann Bonner, a tobacconist, in New Church-street. The prisoners came there on the 1st of May, all three together, Wilson asked for a 1d. worth of Maryland to-bacco—I told him I would not make a 1d. worth—Jerrome then told him to have a cigar—I hesitated, as I did not like to show it them—Jerrome lifted up the lid of the case, and took two cigars—Wilson took a handful of cheroots, and they all ran off—they were not taken till the next day—I am sure they are the same boys—they had often been in the shop before.





GEORGE KING
. I bought the cheroots last Saturday week, of Rubidge and Wilson—I had seen them before—I asked them how they came by them—they said they were got honestly, and I bought them.





PATRICK JENNINGS
. I took Jerrome—I told him it was for taking some cigars—he denied it, but when he got to the station he said he only took two.

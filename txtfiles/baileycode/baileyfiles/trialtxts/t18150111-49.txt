            . On the 10th of December between six and seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of No. 2, Swan yard Bishopgate street, I saw he had this carpet on his shoulder, that is about three or four minutes walk from Brokers-row; he crossed the street and went up New street. I followed him through suspicion; and when I came into New street, he crossed to a house to look for a name as I supposed; he then went to the next house and looked as if to discover the name; I then asked him what name he wanted he said Mr. Mason; I asked him what he had got, the carpet was covered with a mat, he said a brussels carpet, I told him I believed there was no such name as Mr. Mason there; I said we will go into the Magpie public-house and there enquire; I took him into the Magpie, I asked him whose porter he was, he said Mr. Olivers in Brokers-row; he then begged hard for mercy, he said you know my wife very well, I have four children; he has a wife and four children I took him to the watchhouse. I then went to Mr. Olivers and informed him what I had done this is the carpet.
Q. Now Mr. Oliver. is that your carpet - A. It is the property of one of my partners, I had not given the prisoner any direction to take the carpet to a Mr. Mason. I saw the carpet at the watchhouse; it was matted; it would not have been matted unless intended to be sent out, I value the carpet at ten pounds.
The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.

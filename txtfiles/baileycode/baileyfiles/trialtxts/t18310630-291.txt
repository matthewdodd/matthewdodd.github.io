                  CHANNON
               



            . I was secretary to the Potosi La Paz, and Peruvian Mining Association, which was established in London. I have not belonged to it this four years - the object of the Association was to work mines in Peru; the capital was divided into shares, which were bought and sold in the money-market - this paper (looking at it) is a genuine share; there were printed receipts for the scrip, but this is the instrument on which divedends would be payable.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q.You have neither Charter nor Act of Parliament to authorize your proceedings? A. No; the Association may consist of one thousand persons or two thousand for what I know; the office is in Great Winchester-street - the Association is governed by twelve directors, self-elected, and the money was paid to the bankers on account of the directors; the amount collected was 60,000l., as near as I can recollect - I do not think it was 100,000l.; I should say between 70,000l. and 80,000l. - the sums were subscribed in 1825; no dividend has been paid - there is no money remaining at the bankers', that I am aware of; there are deeds - I do not know where they are, as I am not now connected with the Association; I believe the shares are still circulating on the Stock Exchange - the mines are at Potosi, I understand; there was no deed of Association.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it ever given out that there was a Charter or Act of Parliament establishing the Company? A. Never; great expence was incurred in sending out vessels - the money was entirely spent in the necessary expences of the Company; share-holders would certainly not be benefitted by fictitious shares in the market.

            . I am a member of the Stock Exchange- I believe the defendant is also a member; I have known him transacting business there for five or six years - I knew him transact business in the shares of public companies; I have bought and sold shares in the Potosi La Paz and Peruvian Mining Association - they were the subject of bargain and sale in the market in May last. On the 7th of May I received from the defendant fourteen parchment instruments, constituting fifty shares in that Association - four represented ten shares, and ten one each; I gave 10s. per share for them, and paid him a cheque drawn on Sir

                  Lubbock
               



             and Co. by

                  Flynn
               



            , for 1l. 10s., and four sovereigns and another cheque of Jones, Loyd, and Co., my own bankers, for 19l. 10s.; here is is one of the parchment instruments I received - it is No. 3126; here is a figure of 10 on it, which I think is my own writing - it forms no part of the instrument; I have also written on it, "Hayley, for Costello."
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? A. It is not carried on at my expence - I do not know at whose expence it is done; I have heard that it is at the expence of Mr. Measam: time bargains have been done with these shares, but not on the Stock Exchange now - they were some time back; that is buying and selling a given number of shares to be taken at a stipulated future day - I am not aware of more being agreed for than can be delivered, because many bargains are almost immediately closed again, and the differences are paid; this may be called partly gambling.
Q. On the day you agreed with Mr. Hayley for these shares, were you not obliged to wait some time till he could get them from other persons? A. I waited some time for him to produce them, but not long enough to constitute a time bargain - I should think any thing beyond a day would be a time bargain, but if they are delivered the day the bargain is made, I think it is a ready money transaction - time bargains are sales made foran account day; I agreed with a Mr. Costello for the shares - he referred me to Hayley, who was to produce a portion of them; they were delivered about four o'clock on the day I agreed for them - I swear that positively; it was a regular money transaction; I stated this at the Mansion-house - what I said was taken down; my deposition was read over to me, but all I said was not taken down.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has Mr. Measam any fabricated shares in his possession? A. I have not seen any - this transaction was not a time bargain; the money was paid the same day; when I received the shares I received them as bona fide shares - I produced the cheque on Messrs. Jones and Loyd, which I paid him.
MR. EMANUEL LOUSADA. I am a merchant, and one of the directors of the Potosi La Paz and Peruvian Mining Association. (Looking at the document) my name, which is signed here, is not my handwriting; it has been put there without my knowledge or permission - the shares are signed by three directors, and countersigned by the secretary; no other can be genuine - J. B. Lousada is my first cousin and brother-in-law; I know his hand-writing perfectly well - this is not his signature; he was a director at the time


                  JOHN 
                  CHANNON
               



            . Mr. 
               C. A. 
            Thesselton was a director - I know his hand-writing, and do not believe this to be his signature; the name, "John Channon," is not my signature.

            . I am a letter-press and copperplate printer, and live in the New-cut, Lambeth. I have known the defendant about two years; when I first knew him he gave the name of Smith. In March last, when I came home one day, I found him at my house - my young man had taken an order from him, and entered it in the name of Spicer and Co. - the prisoner then ordered me to engrave a plate like a copy which he had got - (looking at a share) it was as near like this as the engraver could do it; he said the former plate was lost, that Mr. Ellis, the engraver, had offended the gentlemen, and there would be a great many other things to be done - I was to engrave this as quick as I could; it had the name of Ellis, as the engraver, and was dated 1827 - I said it was copper-plate; he said Yes, but the plate was lost, and I was to do another; I got one engraved - a proof was thrown off, which I showed to him on paper at my house; he ordered one hundred to be engraved on parchment - I gave the plate, the whole hundred engravings, and the original they were copied from, all over to the defendant - I was paid 7l. for my trouble; I gave a receipt for the money, in the name of Spicer and Co., and delivered it to the defendant, as my young man entered the work to be done in that name - he made not the least objection to the receipt being in that name - (looking at nineteen impressions) I have no doubt these are all impressed from the same plate.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you been a speculator in these shares at all? A. No; I never saw Mr. Measam till about May, nor did my wife, to my knowledge - I was taken into custody about these plates; it was then I saw Mr. Measam - I was in custody four or five days till I could find the defendant; I was not in prison, but in a lock-up house at night, and went out with the officer in the day-time to find him - I was never in prison in my life; I was at the office about disposing of indecent prints, and paid the 20l. penalty for it - one of my apprentices was a witness against me; I have not been in trouble about any thing else - I go to Ascot races; you may have seen me there - I kept a "une deux cinq table;" I never said Mr. Measam employed me to engrave these shares -Barker, who superintends my business when I am out, was present when the defendant came; I did not say, at Unionhall, that nobody was present - he had spoken to Barber, but when I came in and took the business Barber left, and was at a little distance in the office when I took the order.
Q. In the same room? No, the office is divided - there are two rooms, the press and composing-rooms; he left me with Mr. Hayley - he might have heard our conversation if he had paid attention to it; I do not know whether he did; he might have heard part of it - my wife was at home - she works in the business, and saw the defendant; I believe she was in the kitchen - she was about the premises; I cannot say whether she was in the office or not, but she saw him - she was backwards and forwards; he was dressed in a very dark olive or black surtout coat, and wore glasses - I do not know any thing about Mr. Measam.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think I prosecuted you about the papers? A. Yes; I never saw Measam till he took me into custody in May; I never did any work for him - all the while I was in custody I was about with the officer, by direction of the Magistrate, looking for the defendant, and my wife went about at different periods; the defendant pointed out Ellis' name to me on the engraving.
JURY. Q. Are you certain the defendant is the man? A. Certainly - he did not tell me where he lived.
COURT. Q. When did you first know the defendant by the name of Hayley? A. The day he was taken he gave that name - Mr. Measam called him Hayley when he took him; I never knew him by that name before.
CHARLES FREDERICK BARBER. I am journeyman to Mr. Peel. I first saw the defendant in March last - he came to the office to have a plate engraved for the Potosi Association; Mr. Peel was not at home when he came in- he showed me a copy on parchment, similar to this(looking at one); I declined giving him an estimate of the price till Mr. Peel came in, as I did not know the price of engraving - I asked if he would leave his name; he gave me Spicer and Co.; our office is in the back premises below, and as I was shewing him up stairs, I met master - the conversation between them was not exactly in my hearing, for the office where we work has a deal of bustle in it; I did not bear what passed - I saw him leave in about ten minutes; as far as I can recollect, he wore a frock coat, and wore glasses - I saw him again four or five days after, when he came to our house to see a proof of the plate; I was not present when it was shown to him, nor did he say any thing to me about it - I know the engraving had been done then; I saw him again on the Saturday in the same week, when he came to fetch them away - I think it was the same day as he saw the proof; he took away the impressions, which were on parchment, the plate, and the copy it was engraved from - I did not see him pay any thing, and did not see him again till he was apprehended; I am quite sure he is the person.

Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Can you give us the day of the week that he first came? A. No - I know it was Saturday that he saw the proof, as there was a chimney on fire opposite; I cannot say which house - I have no other reason - it was about four or five o'clock; I have lived with Peel about nine months - I did not notice the colour of the defendant's glasses; he had a dark coat, inclining to brown - I know his features, but did not examine him all over; I cannot say what cravat he wore - there were two more men at work in the office, about four yards from master, but you cannot hear while the press is going what persons in the counting-house are talking of, unless you chose to be inquisitive and listen; I cannot say how long these men had been in master's employ, nor recollect their names - they merely came to work a job off; there is a small partition to the counting-house, but still they might see the defendant - he did not pass them to go out; I did not ask the defendant where he lived, but it was asked, because I was desired to put down Stangate - I have the book here: I asked Mr. Peel if he had left his address - he said Stangate; master said he had told him where he lived - if he has said he did not ask him, he must have said an untruth to me, or to the gentleman who asked him, if he did: Mrs. Peel was going backwards and forwards in the office - I cannot say how near she was to him; she passed him, I believe - as far as I can recollect this was in the morning; it might be ten o'clock, or it might be three - the order was given and executed in March, but I cannot tell the day of the month.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the two men in the office at press or composing? A.They were at press that day; it makes a great noise, and engages their attention - the counting-house is separated by a partition: the men were not in our constant employ - I saw the defendant at Unionhall, and had a doubt of him till I heard him speak, on account of his not having spectacles, but had not the least doubt then, and have none now.


                  SOPHIA 
                  PEEL
               



            . I am the wife of Mr. Peel. I saw the defendant at our house in March last, several times in in that month, and I had seen him about two years ago - he then left us the name of Smith; we then lived further up, in the same street - he came to have some printing done; I did not see him again till last March, and recognized him as the person I had seen - he came to know if my husband could engrave a plate for him, and brought a proof with him; Mr. Peel not being at home, he asked Barber if Mr. Peel could engrave a plate like that copy; he told him Yes - I saw the copy he produced; it was like this and printed on parchment - Mr. Peel met him as he was going out, in the passage; I afterwards saw him when he came to see a proof of the plate - I told him it was not ready then, and he was to come on Saturday; I know that he came on Saturday, and waited a quarter of an hour till Mr. Peel came in - I sent our lad for the proof; I took the proof from the lad who brought it, and Mr. Peel came in - I gave it to him, and he showed it to the defendant; I saw him when he came the same night and took them away - I put them up in the kitchen, and just as Mr. Peel came to the door the defendant came in and had them; my husband was taken to Union-hall on this charge, and detained six days - while he was detained I went out, by direction of the Magistrate, with Pople, the officer, to find the defendant; I went to the 'Change, and several places - I at last stationed myself on Londonbridge, and while there the defendant passed; I pointed him out to Pople, and said I was confident in my mind he was the man, but I would not swear to him till I saw him full in the face - I went up, and spoke to him; directly he saw me he put his handkerchief up to his face - I asked if his name was Thompson, or Thomas - I hardly know which, I was in such a state of agitation; it was the first name that came to my mind - he told me that was not his name; I said my name was Peel, and asked if he did not know me - he said No, he did not, he had no knowledge of me whatever; I said I was confident he did know me, for Mr. Peel had done some work for him - he said No, he did not know me, but when he first saw me he thought me very much like a servant that lived with him; I left him, and went to speak to Pople - I told him I had not had a sufficient view of his countenance, but we would watch him, see where he went to, and Mr. Peel should come and see him; we followed him up Gracechurch-street - he went up and down several courts, and when he got to the corner of Bishopsgate-street he looked round to see if I was following him; he had looked round several times before, and not wishing him to see me I went into a shop; when I came out both him and Pople were gone- I saw him before the Magistrate the same afternoon; I am confident he is the person, for I answered the door every time to him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You answered the door the first time, and all? A. Yes - I think it was three times; it was not to me he spoke about the engraving - he asked me if Mr. Peel was at home; I asked him down to Barber - I cannot tell the date on which he first came; I rather think it was the beginning of March, and I think between three and four o'clock - we had dined; Barber dines with us - I think we had dined, but I do not recollect such a trifling circumstance; as near as I can recollect we had dined - I am confident he did not come so early as one o'clock; the apprentice was in the office, and so was I part of the time - I cannot say how long I staid; there was nobody else in the lower office -Barber was at work; I do not remember whether the presses were going - I paid no attention to the conversation between my husband and the defendant; I was in the office in which the presses were - my husband and Hayley were in a small place, a sort of counting-house; it is not a regular counting-house, but only some boards placed across - it is one room; I do not think any body else was at work in the office.
Q. How came you to call the defendant Thomas? A. I had asked the officer what I should do to see his face, but he kept his handkerchief up over his nose and mouth all the time - I do not think any body was at work at the presses when he was there, but I am in and out so many times I do not take notice; sometimes we are busy. and take extra men - my husband was once taken to Unionhall through a person informing against him; his apprentice's indentures were cancelled - I was never taken up; - yes, I was, at Union-hall.
MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that an officer took you into custody, or were you desired by any writing to go to Union-hall? A. I never was taken up by an officerany where; a man had come into the house after this trouble of Mr. Peel's, and insulted me - he struck me, and I slapped his face, because he used improper language to me; that was the subject I went there about - I was never in custody; one of our presses makes a great noise when it is at work.
COURT. Q. You speak of the office and counting-house - they are parted off by a board? A. Yes, as high as my shoulder - a piece is cut out, so that you can see who comes into the office; the defendant and Peel were in the counting-house, and I even with them, but not in the counting-house - it is too small to hold three; I cannot say whether Barber was in the counting-house any part of the time.


                  RICHARD 
                  POPLE
               



            . I am an officer of Union-hall. In May last Peel was in my custody, with liberty to go out with me to look for a person supposed to have uttered a forged instrument - Mrs. Peel also accompanied me at times; Peel had described the person to me - I was on London-bridge with Mrs. Peel, when the defendant came in sight; Mrs. Peel was standing some distance from me; she ran to me, and said, "There, I think, is the man; there he goes;" I accompanied her, and followed him to about the centre of the bridge, about a hundred yards, and then she spoke to him - I did not hear what she said; he had a handkerchief holding up to his mouth, and when she spoke to him he kept it a little way off, but still kept it before his face; after she had done talking to him I followed him with her - she requested me not to lose sight of him; he went up Fish-street-hill, through White Hart-court, and several other little courts, in and out, till he came to the Cross Keys coach-yard, and into Gracechurch-street; I had him in sight the whole time - he did not call at any place, but kept looking back; he went quite out of the way - it was a bye way to get round; he looked back several times, and I suspected he saw Mrs. Peel - after he got across Cornhill into Bishopsgate-street he got a little way down, then crossed over the way - Mrs. Peel passed me, and got into a gateway; I saw the defendant go into a hosier's or draper's shop, and come out again at the same door in an instant - I saw no more of Mrs. Peel; I followed the prisoner into the Stock Exchange - the turnings he took were quite out of his way; having nobody to assist me, I went for Peel, brought him over with me, went into a court at the back of the Stock Exchange, and there Peel identified the defendant as the man - he was in the court among other persons, not alone; he said he was the man the moment that he saw him, without any doubt whatever- I took him into custody, and told him I wanted him for forgery - he said he did not understand or know any thing about it; I got into a coach with Peel, him, and two gentlemen.
Cross-examined. Q. How long had Peel been in your custody? A. Four or five days.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had he been employed in that time looking for the defendant? A.Day and night.


                  THOMAS 
                  CHARLES MEESAM
               



            . I am an agent, and deal occasionally in Mine shares; I have done a great deal in the Potosi shares. I know the defendant; he has dealt very extensively in such shares - I have got into my possession seventeen forged shares, which are here, and more than that; friends whom I have bought for have a great many more - I never saw Peel till he was in Pople's custody; I never ordered him to engrave a plate for me.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are the prosecutor of this indictment? A.Certainly; I have never been a member of the Stock Exchange, but have a clerkship in the house, and am privileged to be a member if I like; nothing has been produced from the mines - the money received by the directors has not been accounted for; I consider the shares worth something till that is done- I am not a proprietor; I am not connected with the Puno Mining Association.
Q. Is not your name on this? (handing him a paper.) A. Yes, I can account for that; Puno is in South America- my name is put here by desire of the jobbers; the dealers wished me to sign them, that they might know a good from a bad one.
MR. ALLET addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant, and called


                  JOHN 
                  BERNARD JACOBS
               



            . I am a jobber, and dealer in foreign shares; I live in Bevis-marks. I have known the defendant two or three years - he sold me forty Potosi shares, shortly before the 7th of May; they were to be delivered to me on the 7th of May, and on the 7th of May he bought seventy of me; I have the memorandum, which I took out of the jobbing book; I had to deliver him thirty to balance - I did not deliver them, but told him to take twenty of Mr. Knight, and ten of Mr. Old; he paid Mr. Old for them, I believe; and I had to pay the difference, which was very considerable.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the prisoner always been a dealer in mining and speculating shares? A. Yes, very largely - I dare say he has dealt to the amount of thousands of pounds; I have dealt with him for some hundreds - mine was a time bargain; I did not deliver shares to him, but referred him to gentlemen in the market - I believe he had them; I paid him the difference in money - I do not consider it gambling.
COURT. Q. Can you tell the number of any one share that passed from you to Hayley? A. No; many hundred shares pass through our hands in a day - I cannot take the numbers.


                  GEORGE 
                  KNIGHT
               



            . I am a watch-maker, and live at No. 64, Goswell-street. On the 7th of May, by direction of Jacobs, I delivered to the defendant two Potosi shares, each being for ten shares; I cannot say in what year they were dated.
Q. Look at this share? A. We never endorse them - my name is on this; it is not my writing - persons sometimes write on the back the name of the person they buy of; I cannot say whether I sold him this share - I sold him several tens; on the 7th of May some notice was taken about some shares being understood to be had, and I think Hayley applied to me about it; but I know nothing of any bad shares - I gave them as I took them; I said I passed them on in the way I took them, and would not take any back - I never suspected him.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is "Knight for Jacobs" on this his hand-writing? A. I do not know his writing - we keep books, but never let each other see them.


                  WILLIAM 
                  OLD
               



            . I am a stock-jobber, and live in New North-road. I have known Hayley about three years- (referring to a book) on the 7th of May, I believe, I delivered him ten Potosi shares, for a person named Jacobs; I cannot say how many tickets they were in.
MR. BODKIN. Q.Will you show me the entry? A.You must look at Friday, the 29th of April - the entry is,"
               D. P. 
            Jacobs, 10-15 for next week," which was the 7th of May; they were sold for the following Saturday -
               D. P. 
            means double Potosi - 10-15s., ten shares at 15s.; there is no other entry to show it was for the 7th of May- next week means the last day of the next week.
COURT. Q. Can you tell us the number of any shares sold to Jacobs? A. No; sometimes ten or fifteen hundred pass through our hands in a week.
RICHARD GRAYDEN. I am a brick-maker, and live at Lambeth. The witness Peel is my brother-in-law; I would not believe him on his oath.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he marry your sister, or you his? A. I married his - I do not live with her; I allow her a maintenance; I married her in 1818 - I live with no woman now; a woman lives with me.
COURT. Q.How long have you been on bad terms? A. I have not spoken to him for nearly two years; I do not know where my wife lives - I pay the parish 3s. 6d. a week for her, and I have my six children at home to maintain; I think I heard Peel examined in a Court of Justice on the 30th of June, 1830 - I did not contradict what he swore.


                  ISAAC 
                  LATIMER
               



            . I was apprenticed to Peel - I would not believe him on his oath.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you heard him examined in Courts of Justice? A. I have once, at Union-ball, about obscene prints; and once at the Court of Requests, where he recovered a debt.
HENRY SEWELL. I was apprenticed to Peel - I would not believe him on his oath.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you serve out your time with him? A. I left him by the Magistrate's order; my indentures were not cancelled - I heard him examined on his oath about an assault, which he charged me with committing on his wife; I was fined 10s.
JURY to J. W. PEEL. Q.Did you engrave the plate? A. No, Mr. Club; the name of Ellis was put on it according to the copy; I took the order, and gave it to Club to engrave.

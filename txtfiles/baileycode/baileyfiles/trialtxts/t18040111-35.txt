            , Jun. sworn. - I live at Portsmouth; my father, 
               
                  William 
                  Burrage
               



            , is a timber-merchant

, we are in partnership: On the 26th of October last, I transmitted by the Portsmouth mail-coach some notes to my father in London at the Angel Inn; there were forty-nine ten-pound notes of the Portsmouth and Hampshire Bank, and one ten-pound which I received in the morning by post from a clerk of our's at Lime, a Bridport note; I sent them in a parcel by the mail, that was the only parcel that went that evening in a brown paper, stringed and sealed, directed to Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Burrage
               



            , Angel Inn, St. Clement's, London


; Walford, our clerk, was present; the amount of the whole sent was five hundred pounds; I delivered it to Walford to take it to the mail-coach office; I have seen the Bridport note since in the possession of Smith, the officer; to the best of my knowledge it is the same note I sent; there was only one Bridport Bank-note.


                  RICHARD 
                  WALFORD
               



             sworn. - I am a clerk of Messrs. Burrages, and was present at the time Mr. Burrage put up the notes on the 26th of October; there was a Bridport note; I took them to the coach-office at Portsmouth, and saw it booked, and paid two-pence; it was No. 20; I delivered it into the hands of one of the proprietors, named Bonamy.

                  DRAYTON
               



             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Burrages: On the 24th of October I was at Lime on their business, and transmitted to them a Bridport note for ten pounds, dated 7th September, 1802, No. 1163, with the letter E before the number; I have seen it since I put it into the letter at Clerkenwell Sessions-house, and am sure it is the same note, but I observed the date has been altered, for I copied the date at the time I sent it.


                  WILLIAM 
                  HOARE
               



             sworn. - I am book-keeper at the Angel Inn; 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Heaven
               



             is the proprietor of the coach business
; the business of the prisoner was coach-washer and lamp-lighter
 in the yard, he was discharged on the 12th of November; he had been with us about three years; he was in our service on the 26th of October; I have a copy of the way-bill; no paper parcel came on that day to the name of Burrage, though it was entered in the way-bill; after that time the prisoner neglected his business, and after his discharge I saw him, but saw no difference in his appearance.
Mr. Alley. Q. Was it not the prisoner's duty to assist about the Portsmouth mail-coach? - A. It was his place to push the coach out after it was unloaded; he had no concern in unloading the coach.
- BROWN sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Mastermans, bankers, in White-Hart-court, Lombard-street; I believe the prisoner is the person I changed ten Portsmouth notes for on the 24th of November, they were payable at our house; nobody was with him; I paid him ten ten-pound Bank of England notes, No. 2706, dated 4th of October; No. 7923, 11th of July; No. 3882, 17th of September; No. 8285, 12th of October; No. 5657, 5th of October; No. 3149, 9th of November; No. 6907, 15th of November; No. 9131, 20th of July; No. 5089, 11th of July; and No. 8485, 11th of November; for ten Portsmouth notes; I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and believe him to be the man; I took notice of him, because on the same day a woman came with ten Portsmouth notes, and was asked what others she would have in exchange; she said, it was a matter of indifference; the clerk gave her one hundred notes, of one pound each, and desired her to count them, which she declined, although he pressed her to do it; she said, she dared to say they were all right; she went out, and no other person came in till the prisoner, about five minutes after, and tendered me ten of the Portsmouth Banknotes of ten pounds each; I thought it extraordinary that two persons should come to close together, having the same quantity of Portsmouth Banknotes; I asked him what notes he would have; he said, it was immaterial; I gave him ten ten-pounds.From the vast number of notes we pay, we do not take person's names; it frequently occurs that sailors have a quantity of those notes, and I thought it possible the prisoner might be one, and I did not ask him his name. About half an hour afterwards, a gentleman came in, and asked me if I knew that a parcel containing Portsmouth Bank-notes had been lost; I said, no. In the course of the morning, Mr. Burrage came to stop them, and I told him I had paid ten of them.
Court. Q. The man coming with ten notes so immediately after the woman excited your attention? - A. Yes, it did very particularly.

                  SMITH
               



             sworn. - I am a Bow-street officer, and produce some notes which I took in the house of the father of the prisoner at Great Ellenborough, in Norfolk, on the 9th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I apprehended the prisoner in his father's bake-house; I searched him, and told him I had come about a robbery of the Portsmouth mail-coach; he said, he knew nothing of it; I searched his wife and him, but found nothing; I then went up stairs with them, and searched a box which she opened, and attempted to take this book, but I prevented her; it contained ninety-eight one-pound notes, fourteen Portsmouth Banknotes of ten pounds, a ten-pound Bridport Banknote, and twelve ten-pound Bank of England notes; I put them into the book again, and brought them and the prisoner to town. Coming to town, he said he found the notes in the Angel yard among some straw, and that the pigs had been routing them about.
(Seven of the ten-pound Bank of England notes and the Bridport note produced, and identified.)

            , Sen. sworn. - I never received the parcel sent by the coach.
Prisoner's defence. I found the parcel in the coach-house amongst the straw that comes out of the different mail-coaches, on the 24th of October.

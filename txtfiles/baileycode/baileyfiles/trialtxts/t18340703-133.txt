EMMA TRUMP. I am servant
 to 
               Mr. Seward
            , who keeps an eating-house. On the 12th of June, about three o'clock, the prisoners came in with a man to dine there, and went away about five o'clock - I had two frocks in the back parlour - when they were gone, I missed them - I ran out, and asked Mr. Farris to assist me in bringing them back - they had got nearly to Hatton-wall, about two hundred yards from our house, - each of them had one of my frocks - these are them.

            . This girl spoke to me in the street, and I took the prisoners with the two frocks under their shawls.
Bolton's Defence. A gentleman went in there with us - we went into the yard, and when we came back, these frocks were by his side - he gave us one a-piece - we did not know they were stolen.

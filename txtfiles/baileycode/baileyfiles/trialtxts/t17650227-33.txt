            . I live in Bishop's Court, in the Old Bailey


: the woman was at breakfast at my room on the 7th of February: she staid in my room with my young child, while I went out. I did not know that Williams was in the house; she lodged in the house, and he lived with her: when I came home I miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment, and she was gone: she was found with the camblet gown on her back, and, upon being charged with taking the rest of the things, she owned where they were pawned, and desired me to be favourable: I only found one shift and one apron; they were found in the lodgings where she went to live.

            , the Constable, deposed, that he searched the lodging where the two prisoners lived together, and found a little box and a shift body. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) Williams had one of the shirts on his back, which the prosecutrix swore to.
William's Defence.
I asked 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Hines 
               



             for a clean shirt; she gave me that; I did not know but it was my own.

ANN CRAWLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of January, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



James Haxell, from his, person.






JAMES HAXELL
. I am book-keeper at the Bull inn, Aldgate. Between nine and ten o'clock, on the 13th of January, I was in Aldgate with a friend—I felt a jerk at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner running off—I caught hold of her, and told her she had my handkerchief—she said she had not, and said I was ill-treating her—she then threw it on the ground, and I gave her in charge—I am certain I saw it in her hand—she was very abusive, or I should have let her go.





HENRY MARTYN
. I was walking with the prosecutor—he left my arm, and followed the prisoner, who crossed the road—he touched her on the shoulder, and I saw her drop the handkerchief—he took it up, and she was taken.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I never saw it till he picked it off the road.




GUILTY
 Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . The prisoner and I both lodged in one room, in two separate beds. I went out in the morning the 19th of August to work, and left her and my things in the room; and when I returned at night, she and all the things mentioned in the indictment were gone. When I found her she had my gown on her back, and has now.

            . The prisoner came and told me she had some things in pawn, and desired I'd fetch them out, and she'd sell them to me (I keep a cloaths shop.) I went with her to five pawnbrokers, and fetch'd them out for twenty-two shillings; a dimity petticoat, a linen shift, one muslin apron, and one holland apron ( produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) I have since sold the pair of stays.
Prisoner's defence.
The white holland apron is my own.
Prosecutrix. I am positive it is my own. I know it by two seams that are on it.

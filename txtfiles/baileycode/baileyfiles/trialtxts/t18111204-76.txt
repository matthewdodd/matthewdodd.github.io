                  JOHN 
                  WHITTAKER
               



            . My partner

's name is 
               
                  Samuel 
                  James Button
               



            . The prisoner was our servant
. We lost musical instruments in September and in November.


                  JOSEPH 
                  TEMPHE
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce a clarinet pawned on the 17th of October by the prisoner for fifteen shillings.
Mr. Whittaker. That is my property.


                  HERMAN 
                  WREDE
               



            . I am the manufacturer of this clarinet. I never stamp the name of Button and Whittaker on any clarinet except such as are actually delivered to them.
Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Wrede can put that mark upon any instrument that he makes, and his men can put that mark on. The prosecutor never missed an article until a person came and told him there was an article at the pawnbroker's. I am as innocent as any of you are.
JURY, Q. to Mr. Wrede. I wish to ask you where you keep this mark - A. In the shop.

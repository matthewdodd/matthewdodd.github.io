            . On the 12th of August I was in Church-street, St. Giles'


, about three o'clock in the morning; I felt my handkerchief taken, turned and saw the prisoner behind me; he ran off; I chased him, and caught him - he threw down the handkerchief, and I took it up; this is it.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me throw it down? A. Yes - there was no young woman with me.

            . I am a wine-cooper
. I live in Chapel-court, White chapel. I met the prisoner at the bottom of Osborn-street


. She took hold of my arm, and asked me to walk home with her; and when we went in the room together, I had my watch in my pocket, and my bundle of dirty clothes under my arm. I was then clean, and when the prisoner went out of the room, I missed my bundle and my watch. The corkscrew the officer found in her pocket.

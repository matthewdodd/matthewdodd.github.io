            . I am a lighterman
, and live at Rotherhithe. On the 20th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming out of the Minories, down by St. Katharine's-dock wall


 - I was sober; the prisoner and three more were coming towards me; they separated, two on each side of me; the prisoner was close to me - he caught hold of my ribbon, and snatched my watch with great violence - he dragged the ribbon right through the loop-hole; the two on the left went into the road - the other, who was with him, went on the right side; I ran after the prisoner, calling Stop him! he was taken in my sight, with my watch in his hand.
Prisoner. It was done in a very dark place. Witness. Quite the reverse, it is lighted with gas all the way.

            . I am a Policeman. I was opposite the Mint, and heard a cry - I stopped the prisoner, and found the watch in his hand; Scott came up and charged him with the robbery.
Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw a man throw something down; I took up the watch, and gave it to the Policeman.

            . I remarked his face, and am certain he is the man who took it.

               receiving five pair of stockings, part of the said goods, well knowing them to have been stolen
            , December 21



. *
John Eldred. I am a hatter
 and hosier
; on the 21st of December my shop was robb'd of 18 pair of stockings, we made no talk of it in the neighbourhood; about a fortnight after, there were three boys taken in robbing a cutler's shop in the Strand, and carried before Justice Welch; one of them, named Turnis, told of many robberies they had committed, amongst them was this of robbing my shop; I at that time was at Bury in Suffolk; my servant went to the Justice, he is here, and will give an account of what he knows about the affair.


                  John 
                  Turnis 
               



            . I am eighteen years of age, Haynes and Heath at the bar, and I, were going by, the prosecutor's shop-door stood open, and we saw the stockings lying in the window.
Q. When was this?
Turnis. It was, I think, on a Saturday, about five weeks ago, about six o'clock at night. I went in and took out a p arcel, and deliverd them to 
               
                  William 
                  Haynes 
               



            , and he gave them to Heath. Then I went in a second time, and brought out another parcel, there were eighteen pair of stockings in all, we carried them to my mother's room, she was out at work.
Q. What is her name?
Turnis. Her name is 
               
                  Mary 
                  Potter 
               



            , there we divided them, and they each gave me a pair, because I went in for them. After that I sold five pair of them to Mrs Goff, the other prisoner, for five shillings, the same night, and I have one pair on my legs now.


                  Joseph 
                  Collins 
               



            . I am servant to the prosecutor; I bought the stockings, that were taken away, for my master; they were missing on the evening of the 21st of December last.
Q. Have you seen any of them since?
Collins. I have, five pair.
Q. What are they worth?
Collins. There are different prices: the lowest cost 2 s 3 d.


                  John 
                  Blyth 
               



            . I was at Mr Welch's; the evidence said he sold these stockings in Fee-lane; the Justice desired me to go there; I went and asked the woman at the bar to see a pair of stockings, she said she had none that would fit me: then I said she must go along with me to Mr Welch. She keeps a shop. I asked her for the stockings she bought of the evidence, he was with me; she said she did not remember she ever saw him before; but presently went up stairs and brought me down five pair, the same that have been produced here.
Q. What did she say when she delivered them?
Blyth. She said they were the stockings she had.
The two boys said nothing in their defence.
Goff's defence. To the best of my knowledge I never saw that boy (meaning Turnis) before in my life.
For Heath.

             were a second time indicted, for 


               stealing one silk cloak, value 10 s. one dimity vest, value 3 s. and one bed-gown, value 2 s.
             the goods of

             , 


               for receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen
            , Dec. 16



. *
Jer. Wardley. I buy and sell these sort of things
, (producing the goods mentioned in the indictment) and I lost the same quantity of goods, on the 20th of December; I found these in the house of the prisoner Wills last Monday was seven-night, but I don't swear to them; they have no particular marks on them, but to the best of my judgment they are mine. The evidence Turnis was with me when I found them; he said he sold the cloak to her, and she produced them all.


                  John 
                  Turnis 
               



            . Haynes, Heath, and I were going through the Alley where the prosecutor lives; we lifted up his sash, and I took out the cardinal or cloak, and gave it to Heath; after that, I took out a white robe, and gave that to Heath; then I took out a child's linnen gown and a shirt; then we went to the prisoner Wills's house, and I asked her a crown for the cardinal; she bid me half a crown: then came in a man; so we went out, because he should not know what we came upon. When went in again, she would give me but 2 s. so I let her have it. After that, I sent in the other things by 
               
                  William 
                  Haynes 
               



            , and told him, if she would not give any thing for them, to give them to her. He carried them, and came back and said she would not give any thing for them, so he had given them to her.
Cross Examination.
Q. Should you know the cardinal again?
Turnis. No, I should know the children's things; a child had worn the little gown, and it was dirty.
Q. Did you ever sell the woman any thing before?
Turnis. Yes, once I sold her a little colour'd handkerchief for a groat, that we got in Newgate-street.
Q. to prosecutor. Look at the cardinal or cloak, what is the value of it?
Prosecutor. It is well worth half a guinea.
Will's defence. This cardinal is not what I bought; I never saw that evidence Turnis in my life. Haynes us'd to come to my shop for bread and cheese, and small-beer; he once came and brought an old cardinal and these child's things, and said his father and mother were sick, and begg'd for 3 s. on them, which I let him have. I gave that cardinal to a poor woman that was going to Portsmouth to wrap a child in; it was piec'd and patch'd.
Turnis. She own'd to the constable that she bought the cardinal of me, and she produced them all together; I was by at the time.
Prosecutor. I was there at the time; as soon as the constable went in and told her what he wanted, she produced them directly.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Pownell 
               



            . I have known her about a year and a half; I always took her to be an exceeding industrious woman. She keeps a chandler's shop, and sells greens, I never heard any body speak amiss of her.
Q. Where did she live?
Pownell. She liv'd in Great Earl-street by the Seven-dials.


                  James 
                  Gordon 
               



            . I have known her about eight years; I knew her when she was servant to Captain 
               
                  William 
                  Gordon 
               



            , who is now at Hallifax; she bears the character of an honest woman. I really think she would not be guilty of buying goods knowing them to have been stolen.
All three 

               guilty
            .

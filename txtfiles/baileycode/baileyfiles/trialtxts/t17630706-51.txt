            . I was reading the paper stuck up in this Court-yard, which gave an account of the prisoners to be tried; having an occasion for my handkerchief, I put my hand in my pocket, and found it was gone. The prisoner was standing directly at my pocket. Two young men came and said they believed he had got my handkerchief, for they had observed him attempting to pick another person's pocket. The prisoner had his hand in his trowzers, endeavouring to conceal something; I saw my handkerchief hanging between his legs; I took it, and had him secured, and brought into a room here to an Alderman, and he was committed.

MARY ADAMS
, dressmaker, Butler's-buildings, East Smithfield. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 2nd of May I was in Aldgate—I saw the prisoner's hand drawing a purse from my pocket—it contained one sovereign, two half-crowns, thirteen shillings, and two groats—he ran off, and I lost sight of him—I was kicked by a person—I saw the prisoner go as far as the cabs near Aldgate church.

MICHAEL CONDEY
 (police-constable H 138.) I was coming up the Minories, and saw a mob round the prosecutrix—I went to her, and from her description I went to the prisoner's house, in Gower's-walk, Whitechapel about half an hour afterwards, I found him with two others—he was in the act of shifting his clothes—he was taking his coat off—he sometimes goes out in a jacket—I would not let him put on another coat.





ROBERT THORP
. I saw the prisoner at half-past six o'clock that night opposite Whitechapel church with two others.

Prisoner's Defence. I had no other clothes to put on; I had not been out all day.

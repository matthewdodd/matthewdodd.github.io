. On the 20th of July this money was in the till in the shop; I was in the room behind the shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and thought I heard a noise. I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner reaching across the counter - I said,
"You have robbed me;" he ran out, and I called Stop thief! he was taken immediately - he was alone. I had given change for a sovereign a few minutes before, and left two half-crowns, and 6 s. 6 d. When he came back there was but 3 s. 6 d. left - he gave up the money immediately, and there was 7 ozs. of tobacco loose in his cap.

, were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
12th of June, 1 pig'g head, value 2s.; and 1 1/2 lb. weight of pork, value 1s.; the goods of 



John Gray; and that Pritchard had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS GRAY
. I am salesman to my father, John Gray, a pork-butcher in Drury-lane. On the 12th of June he had a pig's head, which I saw safe just before twelve o'clock—I did not miss it till I received information—that now produced is it—I saw nothing of the prisoners.





GEORGE BRENCHLEY
. I am a policeman. On Saturday, the 12th of June, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock, I was coming up Fleet-street, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoners in company together—I suspected them, having a green bag with them—I saw Sampson touch a piece of calico hanging out of a linen-draper's shop—they were all three together—from there they walked to Drury-lane—Pritchard and James went into a confectioner's shop, and came out in half a minute to Sampson, who was out-side—they joined and went on to Gray's shop—I saw Pritchard and James go into the shop, James having a bag in his hand—I stood in a court, and saw Sampson waiting outside, watching, and when Pritchard and James came out with the bag it contained this property—they all joined together—I called out to the butcher, and stopped them.

Sampson's Defence. I and James were coming from my sister's, and met Pritchard by Temple-bar—I asked him what he had got; he said, a pig's head, and would I go with him—we went with him.

James's Defence. I was with Sampson, and met Pritchard; we all three went together; we were going home, and the policeman collared me.





JOHN HUNT
. I am a policeman—I produce a certificate of the prisoner Pritcbard's former conviction—(read)—he is the person.

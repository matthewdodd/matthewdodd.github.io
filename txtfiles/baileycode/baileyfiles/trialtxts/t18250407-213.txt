            . I am carman to Daniel Lowe, who is a crape dyer
. Last Thursday, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was loading gauzes at Mr. Herron's door, in Mitre-court, Milk-street


. I left my cart to fetch some more gauzes from up stairs, and when I returned, in consequence of what Savage said, I missed a packet of crape from the cart - I had brought it from Mr. Lowe's; the prisoner was brought to Mr. Herron's in about ten minutes with it in his hand.

            . I saw this cart unloading, and while the carman was away, I saw the prisoner put his foot on the step of the cart, and take the crape out - Mr. Herron came up, pursued and took him with it in his hand.

            . I was going out and saw the prisoner's foot on the step of the cart; I spoke to Savage, then followed him to Honey-lane-market, and across Cheapside - he then ceased running, and I collared him with the crape in his hand; he said he had found it - I am sure he is the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing Queen-street, and saw a person run across with this parcel, and being pursued, he dropped it; I picked it up and hallooed after him.

             sworn.
On the 27th of January last, I being clerk to a benefit society of poor, went to fetch a young man from Bethnal-green madhouse, to send him into the country by the waggon; I brought him into the Castle inn, in Wood-street, where his clothes were delivered to one of the porters of the inn, to go by

                   Shelley
               



            's waggon, and there was a bag put into his waggon, containing the things mentioned in the indictment; I delivered the bag to one of the porters, who put it into the waggon when it was ready to go away, they desired us not to put the young man into the waggon there, but to put him in at the Stones-end; I went with the young man into Goswell-street, and I helped him into the waggon; the prisoner was an assistant to the waggon; on the 28th being Saturday, I was informed of the waggon being robbed, and the young man who was out of his mind, was lost; on the Monday following I went to the sitting Alderman at Guildhall, and there I saw the things, they were produced by Taylor, I can swear to one of the shirts, it is a particular colour, and particularly folded up at the mad-house, I found it pinned up in the same way it was at the mad-house, it was remarkably brown; when I saw the things on Monday, a pair of stockings were missing.

            's waggon, nobody has any interest in it but himself, I was going to Harrow on the hill, on Saturday with a load, and I met the prisoner, he had been with the waggons some time, and I asked him the reason why he was not along with the waggons, whether they had had any misfortune, he said, no, but the waggoner found fault with him, and he would not go any further with him; I was then going to Holborn Bridge with a load, and when I returned my master had had a letter from Colney, that the waggon had been robbed, my master sent me for the prisoner, and I went and found him, and brought him back to the Castle in Wood-street, he had the linen bag under his arm at the same time, I found him in Newgate-street.

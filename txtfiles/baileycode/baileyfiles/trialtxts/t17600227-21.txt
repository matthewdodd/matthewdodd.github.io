            . I live in Hog-Lane


. On Friday last my wife was within side my shop, and seeing the prisoner take a preserving pan from my shop window, she called to me; I was backwards. My wife pursued, and before I could get up to them the prisoner delivered the pan to my wife. She said she was going to shew it to a person.
Q. Did you see the pan in the prisoner's hand?
Mullings. I did, and saw her deliver it to my wife.
Q. How far had she carried it?
Mullings. She had carried it about thirty yards.
Q. What are you?
Mullings. I am a smith. The pan was my property: I had seen it not ten minutes before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take it; he saw nothing at all of it: I never stole a pin's point in my life. I leave it to the jury, and to your honour: I am a poor Irish-woman.

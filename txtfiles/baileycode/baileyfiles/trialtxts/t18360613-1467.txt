JOHN JACKSON
. I live in Kingsland-road, and am a chins and earthenware dealer, I was passing the London Tavern-last Sunday evening between ten and eleven o'clock, and felt a snatch at my pocket—I turned and saw two lads, and the prisoner with my handkerchief in his possession—I seized him by the collar, and took the handkerchief form his left hand—this is it—there is an ink mark on it, by which I know it.





EDWARD REEVES
. I am a watch-maker. I was walking with the prosecutor, and saw him turn round and collar the prisoner with the handkerchief in his left hand—the prisoner said another lad in his company took it, and threw it at him.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

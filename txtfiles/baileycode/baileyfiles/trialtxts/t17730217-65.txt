: the prisoner came into my shop between seven and eight, and asked for some black plain woman's stockings; I took down seven parcels for him to take his choice of them; he said he came from a Mrs. Williams in Fleet-street; at this time my handkerchief lay on the counter; soon after I missed it; I did not find the stockings missing; I had an occasion an hour after to go to Hatton Garden; I saw the prisoner, and what attracted my notice I saw him with a bundle wrapped up in a handkerchief; I suspected that handkerchief to be mine; I charged a constable with him; upon searching him the handkerchief was taken from him.
The constable deposed that he searched the prisoner on the prosecutor's charge, and found a handkerchief and four pair of stockings; they were produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.

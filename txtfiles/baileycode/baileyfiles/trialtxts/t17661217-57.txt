            . My husband is named Richard, we live in the parish of Hesson


; I set the pottage-pot by the side of the door on the 16th of November, and it was taken away; I missed it the same day about two or three in the afternoon; I found it again at Mr. Durling's on the 17th, and on the 29th the prisoner was taken; I saw him at the Justice's; there he said he did not steal it, but owned he was the man that carried it to Mr. Durling's.

             brought the pottage-pot to me on the 15th of November about four in the afternoon; I bought it, and on the Monday Mrs. Dolley came, and asked me if I had bought such a thing; I said I had; he desired to see it, but I had cut it up, and put it among the old metal: she asked me, whether there was not a button put through a hole, with a name on the outside; we looked, and found there was such a thing; she desired me to stop the persons if I saw them again, and on the 29th I believe the prisoner and another man came to me; they went past my door; then Williams turned back, and came into my shop, and asked if I would buy another kettle; I not being in the shop, my lad said, are not you the man that my master bought a little pot of some time ago; he answered yes; I was in the hearing of it; he called out, master, here is the man that you bought the pot of; I came into the shop, and said, what have you got here, my friend; he said, an old kettle, if you please to buy it; I said, take it out of the bag, and let me see it; in the mean time, I stepped out, and desired an officer to be called; I was got but a little way before I saw him out of the door on a full run; I shewed him to the officer, and told him what he had done, and in he went for his staff, and in the mean time he got off; but we met with the prisoner at last, coming up a lane from Isleworth; I clapped my hand upon his shoulder, and said, friend, what is become of your companion; I asked how he came by the brass pot he sold me before; he said nothing for himself some time, but at last he said he met

 on Saturday last, about 4 o'clock, and felt something at my pocket; I put my hand down, and my handkerchief was gone; I looked round, and saw the prisoner passing - he dropped it on the ground; I seized him, and a street-keeper took him; I took up the handkerchief, and knew it to be mine.
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor was walking before me; two young men walked in between, picked the pocket, and threw the handkerchief to me; I took it up, and the prosecutor laid hold of me; they were on the left side of the prosecutor, and he did not see them.

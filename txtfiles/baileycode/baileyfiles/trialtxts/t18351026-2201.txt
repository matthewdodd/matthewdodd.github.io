 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
21st of August, 1 painting, value 5l., the goods of 



William Thane, his master.






WILLIAM THANE
. I am an artist, and live in Russel-place, Fritzroy-square. The prisoner was in my service—I discharged him on the 6th of October, in consequence of suspicion—I lost this painting from my house, and I found it at Mr. Goodge's a cheesemonger, in Tottenham-court-road.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it your own painting? A. No—it was done one hundred years ago—it is on copper—the prisoner was not a pupil of mine—he draws in water colours, but does not paint—I never lent him a painting—his business was to keep my rooms clean, to dust the pictures, and go on errands—I never gave him any instruction in painting—he was with Mr. Lodge seven years, and practised heraldry—he never asked my leave to take things home—the picture is worth five guineas—I gave him twenty shillings a week, and gave him clothes, as I pitied his circumstances—he was in bad circumastances when he came.





WILLIAM GOODGE
. I am cheesemonger, in Tottenham-court-road In August last, the prisoner lodged with me—I bought this painting and frame of him—I bought the picture first for 8s., and afterwards gave him 5s. for the frame, at the latter end of August.

Cross-examined. Q. You gave 13s. for it? A. Yes—I did not know the value of it—he told me he gave 4s. 6d. for it at a broker's.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner,)

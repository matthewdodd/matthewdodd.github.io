MARY SANGER
. I am the wife of Thomas Francis Sanger, a Greenwich out-pensioner. On the 3rd of April I was in Pell-street, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I took my child to see some puppets, which were playing—I had my puree in my pocket, containing 29s. 6d. in silver—there were four half-crowns in it, and, I believe, more—there were some shillings and some sixpences—I did not feel any body touch my pocket—I had the child in my arms—he did not wish to see the puppets, and I took him home—I then missed my purse—I am positive I must have lost it at the bottom of the street—I know it was safe when I went out—I saw the purse again at the office—this is it.





WILLIAM CHILDS
. I am beadle of the parish. On the 3rd of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Well-street, leading

to Pell-street—he had another with him—they passed me—I saw they had got something they had no business to have—I walked after them, and the prisoner put his band into his pocket and drew something out—he said, "This is a b——y good skin," when they got to the end of the street, I then took them—I asked the prisoner what he had got—he said, "Nothing but one penny"—I took him to the office, and took this parse from him, containing six half-crowns and 14s. 6d.

Prisoner. I was coming along, and picked up the purse.

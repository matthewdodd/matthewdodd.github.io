JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant, F 11). On the night of 20th Aug, in consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner in Lambeth-walk—I told him I took him on a charge of felony, and mentioned a portion of the charge, but did not recollect it all—I asked him if that was sufficient—he said, "Yes," and asked if I had a warrant against him—I said, No; it was felony, and there was no necessity for a warrant—he said his name was William Dowling—I said, "You live at No. 5, Nassau-street"—he said, "oh, that is of no consequence you know, as I am going to leave there I give! the Pratt-street address, that will do, it is quite sufficient"—I took a pocket book from him, and this letter (marked No. 1,) which was folded up, but not sealed—he said, "you will not take that letter, I suppose; it is only a private letter to a friend"—I had been to 5, Nassau-street the day before, and ties found some papers in the back-room, second-floor, which Mrs. Dorothy Jarvis pointed out to me, and I there found all these books—among other things there were two receipts for making gun-cotton—(producing the letter marked book marked 2; paper, 3; list of members of the Davis Confederation Club, 4; a number of cards of admission to that club, 5; appointment of collectors to that club, 6; a book, entitled" National Defence Fund," 7; a list of subscriptions to the club, and a fund for Mrs. Mitchell, 8; a paper headed "Defence Fund Account," 9; and a letter from a person named M'Manns to the prisoners taining an account of expenses attendant on the defence of Frank Looney and others.


Cross-examined by
MR. KITSEALEY. Q. Did you attend any of the meetings of that club? A. No, I was very anxious to get the prisoner into custody—I shall not tell you when I received information that he was at Lambeth—it was from some conversation that I had with some of the police—Sergert West and Constable 144 were with me when I apprehended him—I do not. know Sergeant Kennell, a sergeant of the F division—I know Sergeant Co" of the F division—it was not him that told me where the prisoner was to be found—I did not offer twenty guineas or twenty shillings to any person who would inform me where he was to be found—he did not resist in any way—I do not know positively what the word "Defence Fund" refers to.





DOROTHY JARVIS
. I am the wife of the landlord of No. 5, Nassau-street, Middlesex Hospital—the prisoner ocenpied an apartment in our house for about twelve months before 18th Aug.—I know Thompson, who came there to search on the 19th—the room I pointed out to him, the second-floor back room, was the one the prisoner occupied—I saw Thompson find and take away these books and papers.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you opportunities of knowing the prisoners character? A. Yes—he was a particularly quiet, inoffensive man—I never herars him express any sentiments disloyal or in any way against the Queen, or way sentiments relative to war or fighting.






CHARLES FREDERICK CHUBB
. I am an attorney, residing in Gray's Inn. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—I have occasionally corresponded with him—I have never seen him write, to my knowledge—I believe this to be his writing (looking at letter No. 1)—there is a difference in the writing in this book (No. 2)—I can point out what I think to be his writing—this entry of 12th June, I believe to be his—this of 14th June appears to be a very different writing from that—the first three and a half lints of June 12th I have no doubt are his—I do not think the first four linos on 14th June arc his—I have seen this book before, but very cursorily—I think the whole of the entry of the 16th is his writing, except the last four lines—there is a peculiarity of style about his writing, he generally wrote in a large hand, but the very small hand I cannot detect—I have no doubt that this Monday, 3rd July, is his writing, and the whole under that head—the whole under 10th and 12th of July, and I believe 14th, 17th, and 19th—that is the whole of the page—I have not read any part of it—I have only looked at different words—I believe this under the head of meetings 15th, 17th, 19th of May is his writing, and that of 3rd of May also—the whole of book No. 6, I believe to be in his writing.

Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. About a year and a half—he is the son of a respectable solicitor—he is a portrait painter of very considerable talent—I have known him intimately for the year and a half—during the time I knew him he appeared a perfectly loyal subject of the Queen—I always believed him a very inoffensive man, and I did not believe he had any particular view on any political subject—he was a person of very mild demeanour—he has always expressed and conducted himself as a peaceable subject.
(The following entries were read from book No. 2: "May 12th. Committee meeting. Mr. Dowling in the chair. The minutes of the last meeting were read and passed. The Secretary called the attention of the members to the necessity of procuring new members to the club.

The Secretary gave notice 'that on Friday next he would move the dissolution of the Davis club and the formation of a league club, or such other body as may he deemed advisable.' "—Several other extracts were also read. (Letter marked "No. 1"read—"London, Sunday. My dear Ann,—This has been an eventful week in my history. It was only last Monday that I had made up my mind to abandon politics for a while, and retire into the quiet neighbourhood

of Gloucester and Wiltshire, and recruit my health and purse—it has so happened that almost all my connection in London has come from these parts, and these have fathers, and mothers, and brothers there, who as all anxiously awaiting for a visit from me, which I have been for the last twelve months promising, to paint their portraits a nice connection ready cut and dried, to my hand. My friend William Chubb went down last week to spend a month with his father, who is a Magistrate, and solicitor to the Corporation of Malmsbury, and he wrote to me on Thursday, inviting me down, and requesting me to fix the day. Previous to my receiving his letter the events which I wrote of to John, occurred. On Friday evening 1 was informed that the secretary of the Felon-club was arrested, and I knew immediately that my turn was next; I accordingly resolved not to return home till late, and to start for Malmsbury next night. I spent the night in bidding farewell to some quiet English friends, who abominate Chartism, and where I was obliged to act the hypocrite, which I am pretty well used to now; and after midnight I made for home, reconnoitering cautiously as! went along. As I drew near to my own street, I perceived a figure watching me sideways, I strove to avoid him, but he walked up to me, it was a friend; he gave me a sign to keep quiet, and we proceeded quickly in another direction, when he told me he had discovered, through a friend is the police, that there was a warrant out for me, and that there were two policemen, in plain clothes, waiting opposite my own door, he and another friend had posted themselves at either end of the street, outside the police, so as to prevent my falling into their hands at either side; it was, however a very narrow escape; for the, police had noticed their movements. I went with my friends to the private residence of one of the foreign ambassadors, where I supped, slept, and breakfasted next morning; not with his excelled, however, for he was not in town; but with his landlord, a jolly old brick who seemed quite pleased with the mystery. I was introduced to his wife and daughter, as a Mr. Robinson, and I was near getting into a little hobble by forgetting my new name" (an erasure was here made) "I scratch this out for fear of this letter being opened. When I went out I learnt that two of my friends went to my lodging, and burned or carried away every paper that had any allusion to political matters before four o'clock on Saturday; they were scarce gone when the police arrived, and carried away everything they could find, and among the rest Wm. Chubb's letter, which gave them a club to my intended route, and of course compels me to forego all my connections and wander somewhere where I have no friends; I am now an outlaw, and there's no use in bilking the question, my neck is in danger if I am canght—however, I am in excellent spirits, and the only thing in the world that frees me is the bad opinion that will be formed of me by Wm. Chubb and a few other English friends, whose good opinion I valued. However, my consciences is quite at rest: I calculated the risk before I entered upon this business, and I am content to abide the consequences. I must write very little to and-you for a while, and that little will come to you with the London post-mark As long as I am silent you may be sure I am safe, as I will write the moment I am arrested, if I am so unfortunate. My friends are all astonished that am so little uneasy, but I only laugh at them; it is, however, most strange for it has always happened with me that even trifling misfortunes have preyes upon my spirits; but this utter wreck of my prospects has produced a kind to reckless levity, that seems almost unnatural. I have met with the greates. kindness from parties from whom I could not have expected it, but it is only in adversity that you can know who arc your friends. Whenever an of you)."

want to write to me, seal up the letter, without any direction except the word "forward" on the upper left-hand corner, and inclose it, under cover, to Mr. J. Lawler, 17, Pratt-street, Lambeth; and in writing be cautious to say nothing that will give any clue to them if they should open it. I will adopt my mother's name, but do not endorse it on your letters, Mr. Lawler will do that. Write very soon. God bless you all. I was delighted that you wrote to me. Ask Margaret to write to me, but you must not expect answers for some time. Give my love to Mrs. Johanna Kennedy and Mary O. B.—O'Bother, I mean. Mrs.----; faith, I forget her name. Yours ever, Roderic Vich Alpine Dhu. Mind always to both wafer and seal your letters. seal both inclosure and cover, so that Mr. Lawler may know if they have been opened. I should have mentioned that it was one of the Chartists, a fellow named Johnson, his real name being Powell, who betrayed us. W. D. To Miss Dowling, M'Connel-buildings, 36, Jervis-street, Dublin."

of fighting men—Mullins stated that there were nearly 5000 fighting men of the Chartists alone—a return was also given in from the Confederates—I can not remember the number of them for a certainty, but I think it was something bordering upon the same number—it was a considerable number—✗ said the time was near at hand—he said, "Gentlemen, the next business is that I want every delegate to select four or six men, or more, as many as the can select iron; his locality"—there was a question asked what they were for-J do not know by whom—Cuffy answered, "To fire houses, railway premises trains, or anything"—I did not put anything down at the meeting—I was obliged to be cautious not to put any thing down—Mullias looked up at the gas which goes along the ceiling, and said "If I look up at the gas, you will at know what I mean"—I was asked how many men 1 thought I could select and I said two, and the other delegates right round gave in a return also—it was said they were to be men who could be depended on, who would do any-thing and everything—in the course of the evening there was a propositives made and carried, to send a deputation of two persons to have an interview with some of the North-Western Railway engineers, and ascertain what then feelings were, and whether they were willing to come over and assist the Chartists—Ritchie and Scurry were proposed and unanimously carried the purpose—I was not aware till that evening that there had been a def-erence between the engineers and the company—it was mentioned then because it was requested to know what they were going for—is. 6d. was voted to defray their expenses for refreshment—they left forthwith on lie: mission—they were not present when the other resolutions were passed-! did not see any more of them that evening—there was a resolution passed that we should meet at half-past seven at the Lord Denman on the following Tues-day evening—I went—Payne, Brewster, Mullins, Cuffey, Dowling, Allnutt, Fey Gurney, Lacey, Ritchie, Ferdinando, and others, in all about forty, were there-Lacey was there when I got there—he entered into conversation with several of us, and told us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, but am not certain, were up and were doing, or would be doing that night, and he had been watched all day by the police, and as he was coming out of his street-door, a boy came up and told him that he was watched by the police—I had never seen Lacey before, I had only heard of him—he said he had been to Birmingham and Manchester, and other places, but I do not re-member for a certainty what those places were, and he had also been watched for two hours, and he gave the police the double, and had reached the place safety—about three quarters of an hour after that, there was a distributee colours by Brewster—they were twisted plaited ribbons, and were gives a the delegates so that they might be recognised as the leaders of the people—Brewster stated so—they were to be put on the left arm—they were three colours, red, white, and some other—I received one—Mullins was prcsent as their distribution, and after that some of the committee came in—they were not-all present, at least I did not see them, but one or two of them spoke, are told Lacey they had better retire and consult—the room up-stairs was ✗ pied by a sing-song, and we had the lower room—Lacey said, "If yes will wait a while I will go and see at a neighbour's coffee-house, whether we cannot have a room"—he went out, returned, and said "All right, or some such word-, and the committee went out with him—I did not go—they were gone about three quarters of an hour, or it might have been an hour—the delegates remained till they returned—they went away, to consult to gather-when they retured, Cuffey said, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you has better give the; instructions as quick as possible"—Mullins was acting-as

chairman—Laccy went with them when they went out—I did not see him return with them, and was surprised at it—Cuffey was secretary; I was informed he was chosen secretary by the committee—Mullins said, "Gentle-men, as you are aware, the committee have retired, and come to certain reso-lutions and decisions; they have directed me to give you the following instructions; and as our friend, Mr. Lacey, has informed us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up, and will be doing to-night, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, therefore, gentlemen, to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow; and it is necessary, gentlemen, that you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey stood by the fireplace, and said, "You had better put it round, Mr. Chairman, to every one present; let them answer, 'Yes' or 'No'"—Mullins on that appealed to a delegate sitting by me, and said, "Will you come out to fight?"—he said, "Yes"—he said to me," Will you?" and I said, "Yes"—then he said, "Will you?" addressing each in turn, one by one, round the room, till he came to Mr. Ferdenando, who made a bit of a speech, and explained his reasons that he could not conscien-tiously say "Yes" to coming out—he objected, he was not agreeable; in fact, he said, "No"—he gave his reason, and then said, "No," and sat down—there was one more of the same opinion—I do not know his name—he was companion delegate, I understood, to Allnutt, who sat by his side—with the exception of those two, the answer from the rest was, "Yes"—after that Mullins said, "Gentlemen, you must understand we shall take up four positions: Clerkenwell-green will be taken by Mr. Brewster; the Tower Hamlets will be taken by Mr. Payne;" and the Seven Dials, and the Broadway, Westminster, were the other two positions—Basset and Mullins were to take those two—I do not know which was to take each—Mullins said, after giving the instructions in that manner, "Gentlemen," every delegate must assemble the members of his locality, for them to communicate to their locality at eight o'clock precisely"—it was to be the next night—there was a question asked by a delegate, I do not know who, how they were to get there with their pikes and poles?—Mullins said, "I can only say they must get them there the best way they can," (some of the poles were ten feet long), "and at twenty minates past nine, to a second, every delegate must be with his men at their respective positions"—the delegates were to come armed—Mullins proposed, and it was carried unanimously, that Ritchie was to superintend and direct those men that were to be selected for the purpose of firing houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Ritchie undertook it—the Orange Tree was to be the place of meeting—a question was asked, how Ritchie was to know these men, and some person said, "I propose the password to be, 'Frost and Mitchell'"—Allnutt proposed the word "Justice"—it was put, and carried unanimously; so that when these men entered the room Ritchie might ask them, "What do you want? who do you want?" and they would make reply, "Justice;" and then he would know them—Mullins said to Payne, "Just take a list of the number of men;" and he put them down; but he made a mistake, and there was some little confusion with the delegates—he went round the room again, and the number was reckoned forty-six—he applied to the person who sat next to me first, and then to me, and I said, "Two," but I could only depend on one—he went round to every delegate, and in that way forty-six was made up—Gurney was there at the time, and when—I said I could select two, he said, "Oh, nonsense, you can select more than that, half a dozen, I know" I Was rather put out at his taking on himself to judge upon it; in fact, there Was but one man that I could depend on for the purpose—Gurney

was one of the wardens before I was elected on the council—each warden has 100 men under him, according to the rules of the Society—after the number of men was taken, the last words Mullins uttered were, "May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of that man that shall betray any one of us"—it was such a colour as this (produced) that was to be tied round the arm—nothing more took place that I remember—I came away—the prisoner was there that night, and sat nearly opposite me—I attended a meeting on the following day, 15th—it had been arranged on the Tuesday evening at the Lord Denman, that our locality, the Finsbury, City, and Clerkenwell localities, were to meet Brewster at twelve o'clock, at the Crispin, in Milton-street, Cripplegate, to receive the delegates from each locality—I went, but did not arrive till a quarter to one—I found Brewster, Gill, Gurney, and I believe Fay, and others, eight or nine altogether—I have not made a note—Brewster said it was his intention to attack the Artillery-ground, and, if possible, to take it, and he should have to fight b——y hard, and that we should know by four o'clock in the afternoon whether the Government had received any intimation of what was going on—there was another person with him at the time; in fact, it was the man who told me at Perry's coffee-shop that there was no meeting there, and that it was all up with Rose—Brewster pointed to this person, and said, "Wait on me at Clerkenwcil-green when you are all there"—Brewster said, "Don't be afraid because you do not see the signals for a little while; you might not see the signals for half an hour, but wait a bit"—it had been arranged at the Orange Tree that there were to be bonfires—the men who were selected, were spoken to on that same evening, for I spoke to my men—Brewster also said, "Ritchie swears, so help his God, he will shost the first person dead that flinches from his duty."

Cross-examined by
MR. KENEALEY. Q. Have you attended many of the Chartist meetings at Kennington-common and other places? A. I believe only one on Kennington-common; that was on a Sunday—I went with son of mine out of curiosity—I should think that was not above five months ago—per-haps more, but I think it was under that—I do not know whether it was before or after I became a delegate, but I rather think it was before it—that was the only one I attended—I did attend at Bishop Bonner's-fields twice or three times when the meetings were on Sundays—I attended a public meeting at Milton street for a short time—I think five or six is all I have attended—I cannot say how many I attended before became a delegate—I entered the Chartist Society after 10th April—I cannot say how many public meetings of the Chartists attended before I became a member—I cannot say whether I attended any—I cannot recollect it—it was not by attending these meetings that I gat acquainted with their principles or with them—I went to Kenmngton common on 10th April—I believe that was the first meeting I attended—it was some time after that that I became a member—I never saw the prisones at any of the Chartist meetings—I never considered him a Chartist only a Confederate—I do not know that I have heard him say he was not a Chartist—I do not recollect his saying that the Charter was not worth fighting for, and that it would be obtained peaceably in two years he might—I will not swear he did not say so in my presence—I should not have been surprised if he had said so—he was a very quiet speaking man, and never took an active part—I always took him to be inoffensive and quiet—I consider it would 'nave been in accordance with his principles if he had said—I do not recollect his saying that he was perfectly loyal to the Queen, and he considered her as one of the best sovereigns that ever was in England—I have met him another places besides at the committee meetings—I never heard his

say a word about the Queen—there were about forty delegates present at the meeting at the Lord Denman, when Mullins was in the chair, and when he asked them all if they would come out and fight—the prisoner sat nearly opposite me, on the other side of the table, at that meeting—I had a full view of him—I will positively swear he was not one of the two who refused to fight or to say, "Yes"—I positively swear that I heard him say, "yes"I have not got the credentials which I got from Bezer—it was the leaf of a book which was handed by me to Payne, who compared it with his book—it corresponded, and he said, "That will do"—there was no writing on it, it was a plain leaf out of a book—at the latter part of the time persons were allowed to sit among the delegates without producing cre-dentials—there was a great deal of imprudence in doing so—it was not allowed when I first went among them, no person then could possibly have been allowed there unless he was a delegate, and produced credentials—I do not remember that the chairman at the Lord Denman said, "Oh, that is all right "—the first meeting that I recollect seeing the prisoner at was on 20th July, at the Black Hart—that meeting consisted entirely of delegates and persons who delivered credentials—one person was admitted without credentials; but I objected to it, and he was not allowed to stop—I do not recollect that there was some conversation at that meeting about Dowling having no credentials—Dowling was there before I got there—five persons were proposed and carried, to draw out five plans of operation, and the five plans were to be produced on the next morning at Dennis's Coffee-house—they were to be inspected by all the delegates present, and the best was to be decided on—it was usual to produce credentials as the persons came in—the chairman was in the chair at the time—I did not see Dowling produce any credentials.

Q. What induced you first to join the Chartist body? A. Two things, curiosity and for the purpose of obtaining information and giving information to the authorities—I joined them of my own will—I found as soon as I bad been to—the place once or twice that they were a rum lot; I did not know before I joined them that they were rather a rum lot—I found it as soon as I entered—I went to the place before I joined them—I thought perhaps they would do something to me—nothing about money, but something worse than money—I should say a bit of steel was worse than money—I judged that these parties would be inclined to put a bit of steel into me—I did not give them any provocation—I judged so from the conversations I heard—it was not conversations relative to myself—I considered they were of that class of persons that would not be scrupulous of doing anything—that was before I joined them—there were many men that I thought would do anything or commit any kind of deed, and my impressions have been confirmed—the. phrase "anything and everything" is not a favourite one of mine—I should say these men would have had very little hesitation in putting steel into me, and particularly now—they would not have minded doing it before if they found it was necessary—I am a carpenter by trade—I live partly on property which I nave, and partly upon my hand labour—that was sufficient—I am like every-body else, anxious to get more if they can—my object in joining the Chartists was not to make money by betraying them, it was for the good of my country swear that I had no pecuniary object in giving information against these persons—I did it merely to do my country service—I put myself in commun-ication with the police almost directly I had become associated with these men—I introduced myself to these men—I visited Cartwright's, and ultimately become a member—I did not tell them anything particular when I first visited them—I mixed with them of course—I do not think I ever shouted for the

Charter—I did not do so at Kennington-common—I cannot tell you five amount of money the General Delegation had in their coffers from begining to end—the money was appropriated in various ways, the secretaries managed that—they could tell from their books—I should say they had a good deal more than 5l. or 6l.—I cannot tell how much they had, not 1000l.—I should say what they collected from beginning to end would amount to a good deal more than 20l.—I cannot tell you the amount, I was not secretary, I had very little to do with the books—when I put myself in communication with the police they did not tell me to take notes of all the meetings I attended, that was my own suggestion—I have never shown my notes to any person—some of these notes were made when I got home after the meeting, and some were made next day, but I swear none were made later than a day after, and the latter part of it I can positively state when I did it—I was at work at this time—I did not make any gunpowder—I made ball-cartridges, at least I have filled ball-cartridges for Gurney, our warden, and I occasionally cast bullets and delivered them to him—I suppose I have cast fourteen or fifteen doses for Gurney—I filled no cartridges except sixty-eight, which I had from him out of his cupboard, and I still have them in my possession—I did not make any fire-balls, or any other combustibles—I confined myself to bullets and cartridges, according to Gurney's directions—I did not make any pike-handle or any other implements for fighting.

Q. I believe you thought these men were not going quick enough to work, and you suggested that they ought to procure larger quantities of powder A. I suggested what I declared according to the resolution come to at the delegate meetings—I did not suggest to them to make quantities of carbides and bullets—I am speaking of Gurney—I did not suggest anything to Gus-ney—that was merely a word that fell out—I did not say at Bow-street that I stimulated these men to cast these bullets—I never gave any powder of bullets to any mortal being save Gurney—he is now in custody—I know man named Dennis Dwaine—I do not remember having any converstion with him about the absurdity of his moral force doctrines—I do not know him personally, I do not think I ever spoke to him.

Q. Where have you been living since this? A. That is a question I do not know that I ought to answer—I have been partly living at Her Majesty's expense, I suppose—I do not know that it has come from Her Majesty—there is not a great contrast between the style of my dinner since I betrayed these men to what it was before; in fact, I lived better before—I am paid badly—I am receiveing money for my support—my life has been threatened—I am not receivings much as when I was a journeyman—I am receiving only a pound a week—I am, not to get a farthing if I convict these men, I positively swear that—no one has told me so—I only judge so—such a thing has not been broached—I do not entertain any hope of getting any money for it, I look for protection from person danger, and that is all—I do not look for any promotion or pecuniary reward of any kind—I never told these men to set fire to any places—I have bait spoken of—I never told them that I did not approve of the slowness a tediousness of their proceedings—I have said I was sick of their talking, they evinced so much talk, and that was all that would be done with them—I might have said such words as those—I do not remember saying that I was sick of their talking and doing nothing; I might—I cannot tell you what I meant by saying I was sick of their talking—words may have been spoken by me at times which I really had no meaning to—I do not remember whether it was at any of the delegate meetings that I told them I was sick of their talking—I believe 1 have stated all that I repeated myself—I do not remember saying

was sick of their talking, and wanted them to go to work—I did not say that I told them I was sick of their talking—I may have said so, but I am not—sure—I will not say I did not say so—I did not tell them they were going too slow to work, and the best way to get their rights would be to set fire to London—I do not believe any such words were ever uttered by me, or any-thing to that effect—I did not in any way stimulate them to get bullets and gunpowder; once I was told to speak at a meeting about making preparations, or something of that sort—what I stimulated them in was in giving Gurney the gunpowder—I did not cast bullets for anybody but him—I considered that was stimulating them—(The witness's deposition being read, stated, "I stimulated them on in some respects—I gave some of them bullets and powder—I gave Gurney some bullets and powder only, and not anybody else")—I meant Gurney only—I swear positively I never gave powder, bullets, or paper to any other mortal being save Gurney—I do not think I said at Bow-street, in answer to Mr. Macnamara, that I stimulated the people on—I meant that I stimulated Gurney—I meant to confine it to him—I used no stimulation to him, except that he asked me to get some lead and powder, and such like for him to make the cartridges, and I did so—he said the cartridges were for use—I expected what they were for—he knew what was going on—I believe of course he intended to use them on a future occasion, I suppose in fighting.

Q. Against the Queen? A. I do not know about against the Queen, but if a collision took place between the Chartists and the police of course he would have used them, I suppose so—I made them at his desire, it was his suggestion, not mine—he had been a long time making these things—I am aware that Gurney is to be tried—there was a suspicion of spies—they suspected me as a spy—I can hardly tell you what I was suspected for at first—am I bound to say how they came to suspect me?

COCRT. Of course you are. A. Then I will tell you how it was—a person, named Rowland, who is a carman to a brother-in-law of mine, is a Chartist, and had been for years, and I was in communication with a certain party; that party called at my brother-in-law's premises, he saw this party and knew him, and he came to our locality and charged me openly with it: I vindicated myself as much as possible, that was how I was charged, but I cleared the matter up then, and the party that charged me was bundled neck and heels out of the place.

MR. KENEALEY. Q. Why not tell me that first? A. It was a matter that re-quired concealment, and I of course kept it concealed, and I did not answer the Question till I was bound to—in fact I have not given you the whole yet—I have told you how I was suspected, and that is all—Rowland charged me with being a spy—I was not charged as a spy by any delegate—Rowland was not a delegate—none of the delegates were present when I was charged with being a spy—the delegates did not suspect me—they knew nothing at all about my naving been alleged to be a spy—I had some conversation about it now I remember, with Mr. Mullins, at the Milton-street meeting—he was on the platform, and I told him that some time ago I was charged with being a spy, and he himself was charged—there were such foolish suspicions in the minds of the members of the locality, I was surprised to find they were suspecting most of the members as spies.

Q. Were you surprised to find that they were such fools as to suspect you as a spy? A. well certainly, if I am to use such a vulgar epithet, they were fools not to know the difference—they did not suspect me.

Q. How did it happen that they admitted you among these delegates, and to all their secrets, when you had not become a member of the Chartist

Society before? A. Because I was elected by the Council, and went there—I cannot say why I was elected by the Council—the fact was the others were afraid to go—the Council consisted of Fowler, Owen Jones, Car-myself, and Battice—Mr. Battice accompanied me that night, and was afraid to go to any other meeting—some stranger in the room asked me whether I had any objection to stand as one of the Council—I said no; and I was proposed—I never asked him to propose me—I did not suggest it to him—I do not knew who the stranger was—I cannot tell what made him suggest it—he gave me no reason for asking me to join the Council—he did not say, "Powell, yen are a great Chartist, a determined fellow, and ought to be on the Council"—no one knew me by that name—he did not say, "Johnson "—I do not think I had ever seen that stranger before—I do not think I ever saw him before that night—I cannot say whether I have ever seen him since—he was sitting by my side, and proposed that I should be on the Council—he may have seen me before—I was not very much inclined to go on the Council—I never put myself forward, for they were very inattentive to these matters; they was not careful—they did not know where I lived, nor what I was, and scared: knew my name—I did not say I did not wish to be on the Council—I not put myself forward—I had no particular wish not to be on the Council if I was elected I should have gone in; and I was elected, and did go in I knew I should have a better opportunity of getting information if I was on the Council—I was not pressing for it—I wished it to a certain extent, but not to force myself in.

Q. You wanted to dive gradually into their councils? A. Of course I did and to be unsuspected, for the purpose of betraying them with the greaters ability—I cannot remember how long I was on the Council before I was made a delegate—I think it was a short time after Mr. Williams was secretary—I cannot say to a certainty how long it was, it may have been above ft: months—I could tell if I had the books the time I entered, but I really cannot now—I kept no note of it when I entered—I did not keep a diary of my transactions, only this produced—I kept this on purpose that it should improve my memory in giving an account of every transaction that occurned—my memory is pretty good in some things, and bad in others—it is goo: so far as to know what did take place, and no more—it was the men who went to the Orange Tree that were to use the word "Justice"—every delegate knew the word, and was to communicate the pass-word to every man that he selected for that particular purpose, so that no man could enter the room or know what was going on at the Orange Tree, unless he made use of the word "Justice "—only one delegate was to be there, and that was Ritchie the firemen were to come there and use the word "Justice," and he would know them—it was understood that no other person was to go there no others person had any right to go there except those men for that particular put pose—these were books kept by the delegates on two occasions—I saw them on the table—the leaves were torn out the first night of the meeting, 20th July—I cannot tell whether any of those books have been used by the Crown—I have seen a person named Luke King—I was present at a meeting on 20th—July when King came—he said, "if I have been rightly informed, you, the Secret Commitee, have been sitting day and night for some time past; is that true or not?"—Mr. Payne said, "There is some truth in it"—they were very cautious what they did in King's presence—he was very much out of temper and left in a very hasty manner, and went down stairs—I do not believe said a word—it was the first night I was there—I did not deny that there were any secret meetings held—how could I, I did not know it—that was the only

meeting that King was at, that I know of—I did not get up meetings for the-purpose of getting money together—Mr. Owen Jones was one that got them up—I never got a farthing of the money at the meeting on 30th July, at Cartwright's coffee-shop—I do not recollect any money at all being paid that evening—Payne was in the chair; I believe it was Payne—it was very seldom that Mullins took the chair.

Q. Did you hear Dowling say that evening that the plans of the committee had been concocted in his absence and he did not understand them, and as far as he did understand them he disapproved of them altogether? A. He might have said such words; I do not know whether he did—on my oath I did not hear him utter such words—if he had I should have heard it—I do not suppose he did use them at all—he resigned that night, but he was re-elected—I do not know that he gave that as a reason for resigning—if he did I should have heard it—it is very likely he might have said it—I do not know that he gave any reason for resigning; I do not recollect that be said anything about it—there was a charge brought against Mullins and Rose about their being spies—that occasioned a great deal of confusion, and the committee resigned—no other reason was given—there was another resignation, on 7th Aug., in consequence of Smith O'Brien's arrest; that was not on 30th July—I was present at the discussion relative to the accusation—I told them I had heard so much in our locality that I myself had been accused of being a spy, and that it was so much trash, to put it aside altogether—I believe those were the very words I used—they did not suspect me of being a spy—I mentioned to Mullins, at the Milton-street Theatre, that I had been suspected as a spy, and that was the only night I mentioned it to him—I also men-boned it at the time of the discussion—I indignantly repudiated the notion of my being a spy; I did not positively assure them that I was not a spy—I did not do either one thing or the other—I never gave them to think I was or was not, I let the matter pass—I spoke to my men, to be ready on the Tuesday night—I spoke to two men to be ready for firing; one was Abel, who was taken at the Orange Tree; I do not know the name of the other man—I knew the man; I have known him perhaps four or five years—I told him that I was delegated by the resolution come to at the meeting, to find four men for the purpose of firing houses and premises, and I called him on one side, and spoke to him on the subject, and he appeared to be disposed for the purpose—I was in conversation with one of the men about a quarter of an hour, and with the other about the same time, and told them for what purpose it was.

Q. What object had you in persuading those two men to join you in this. firing expedition? A. It was a resolution come to at the meeting to select, four men each, and I did not know any more, except those two men—one man was disposed, and Abel, when I left him, did not seem disposed, and I never took any further notice of him—I felt bound to carry out the resolution of the delegates, or I could not have led them to feel I was discharging my duty—the other man I spoke to was not a delegate—I did not want to entrap him into this—I spoke to him on the subject, and left it to his own option—was doubtful whether he would do it, and although he told me he would go to the Orange Tree I did not believe him, and he did not go—I did not use any effort to persuade him to join in firing the houses—I told him what it was for, and said, "Consider it"—I did not endeavour to entrap the men; it was just to carry out the resolution—if he had fulfilled the resolution, it would certainly have entrapped him; but unless I had spoken to him I should not have fulfilled that which was expected of me—I did not feel bound

to carry out the resolution to the extent required, but merely just to speak to the men—it was never my intention to get them to do such a thing—if they had consented to fire houses I should not have dissuaded them; but it was not my intention they should do it, for all that.

Q. When did you first begin to communicate this affair to the Government? A. Soon after 10th April—the Secret Committee sat the very next day after I attended the first meeting—that was on 20th July—I was not in communication with the Government before that—I first put myself in communication with these parties very soon after 10th April, very soon after I joined the Chartists—I communicated every movement that I knew of, from time to time; they knew everything—I saw something illegal in the council when I first joined them—I knew that there was a rising; that was before I put myself in communication with the Government—the parties with whom I communicated did not persuade me to continue among the delegates—they did not tell me not to do so; I did it of my own accord—I saw them, often, I did not see them regularly once a week—I do not know what has become of the man I wanted to fire the houses—I went to none but the two, I never spoke to a soul besides—I did not tell him anything about firing railways—I said it was for firing houses and premises—there was not a word said about killing the police on that occasion—if I bad received orders from the delegates to get any one to kill the police, I should not have considered myself bound to carry them out; I merely did what I was desired, with reference to firing houses; I merely spoke to him—I never said they were not to consider whether there were people in the houses—this is the only occasion on which I have got people to fire houses; the only occasion on which I was asked to go—if I had been asked on other occasions I should have done so—I should not have fired any houses—I only heard the men talk about a Republic once—Dowling was present then—when Payne spoke of destroying the power of the Queen I said nothing, I was not on the Committee, and was surprised that they allowed me to be present—Rose spoke about assassinating the police—I was in communication with the police then—I offered no remarks on the subject, as I had no right to be there while they were sitting—it was business which ought to have been transacted by the committee alone—as delegate ought to have been present—I was present on one or two other occasions—they generally met before the general body of delegates, and before the delegates left they consulted together—that was the meeting where they produced plans, and talked about barricades—it did not occur to me that it was a curious thing that such important things should be communicated at a meeting at which I had no right to be present—nothing was said about my presence—there is no doubt there were many propositions made that were not made known to the general body of the delegates—I saw a plan; to the best of my knowledge this is it (produced)—on my solemn oath the word "fighting men" was used—the very first night Mullins asked us to give in out returns of the number of fighting men, those were his words—it was proposed, I think, by Donovan, to send a delegate over to Limerick or Cork to know how things were, in consequence of the difficulty of getting information at the time the excitement was going on—I do not remember Dublin being mentioned—I never heard of any communication between the delegates and the people of Cork or Limerick—when Mullins said, "May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of the first man who betrays any one of us," I did not think he meant me, because he did not know I was in communication—I have been a carpenter for the last ten years—I was a bed-pillar carver before that—I have made more by carpententry

than by spying—the "Ulterior Committee" is the only name that I am in possession of as the name of the Committee—I do not remember saying there was a plotting committee—I may have called it so—I have heard it called so—I do not know by whom, but the name was the "Ulterior Committee."





JOSEPH THOMPSON

re-examined. On 11th Aug. I searched Rose's premises—he was with us, and showed us the place—I found this plan, marked "A;" this map of the City-road, "B;" a map or sketch of Seven Dials, "C;" blank forms for plans to be filled up; one of Seven Dials; and the other, beaded "Clerkenwell;" three recipes for gun-cotton, and these two lists of numbers—I found this cipher (produced; No. 11).





WILLIAM CHUBB

re-examined. I believe this (No. 11) to be the prisoner's writing—(This being read, contained various marks and figures, with names and words attached to them, among which were "Pikes," "Rifles," "Killed," "Shot," "Barricades," "Victory," "O'Brien," "Doheny," "Tipperary." "Poison," "Fire," "English," &c. The papers found at Rose's being read, contained a variety of names contracted, with numbers placed against them, signifying the various localities, their number, and names of the leaders, among which were the following: "Wall. 80; Bass, and Nas.—Lamb, lo 150 Ped.—Ber. 50; Dean. 250; Cuff. Thom.—Star. 50; Pear.-War—Irish, 50; Ritch.—St. Gils. 100;—Carts. 50; Fel. 100; Mitch 30; W. Ty. 20;—Fuzz. Fa., &c."






CHARLES TILDEN
. I am a brass-chaser, of 26, Little Earl-street, Sevendials, and work for Martin and Gracy, of Rathbone-place. On 27th May I became a member of the Chartist club in Dean-street—Cuffey was the class-leader—each class-leader has nine men under him, and gives orders to them—he gave me orders to get gunpowder to make ball-cartridges to fire on the police—he said the time was close at band"; that was about the middle of June—I said I had not got a gun or a musket—he said, "Never mind that, make the cartridges up, and when the time arrives break into the gun-shops and get them"—some time afterwards I met him in Wardour-street, and asked him how to make the cartridges—he gave me directions—about a week afterwards I went to his lodgings—he showed me a pike, which he said was Mitchell's pattern, and asked me to sharpen it for him, but I did not—I saw this pike-handle as well (produced)—I went again, and found him casting talks from letter-type—I saw about a dozen—he said they were to make up into cartridges—he said So-and-so had got some ginger-beer bottles with pieces of ragged iron in them, and that the wives of the Chartists were to chuck them out of the windows on the police, while the husbands were fighting with the police in the streets—he said the soldiers would soon be drained away to Ireland, and London would be in our hands—I have seen Dowling at the Davis club—he was the Secretary.

Cross-examined. Q. When did you enter into communication with the Government? A. About a month after 29th May, when I became a member—joined as a moral-force Chartist, not for the purpose of giving information to Government—I gave information for the good of the public and myself—I believed it to be my day I did not broach the subject of the ginger-beer bottles I said So-and-so had got ginger-beer bottles, with pieces of ragged iron in then, and bits of tow round them, and he said they were very good things to chuck out of windows—I said nothing about gunpowder, in reference to ginger-beer bottles, till Cuffey mentioned it to me—I did not ask him to eatrap him-but to see if I could escape any plot being laid, as I suspected Plot then—he thought I was one of the right sort—I allowed him to continue in that belief till he was taken up, I played the traitor all the time—I

did not tell him would join in the attack on the police—I may have broached the subject of attacking the police, three times—it was not four—I did not commence the conversation, only about the finger-beer bottles—I did—not say a word about the police—I commenced the conversation with reference to destroying the police, three times—Dowling was not a member of the club I was in—I have not been in the pay of the police—I have received no Government pay, and do not think I shall—I have received nothing for the evidence I am giving, and do not expect to.

MR. ATTORNLY-GENERAL. Q. What was said in the conversation with Cuffey on Sunday morning, '? A. He asked if I had heard of any orders, and gave me orders to get 2lbs. of gunpowder.





THOMAS BARRETT
. I am a shoemaker, of 17, Charles-street, Lisson-grove. On Whit-Sunday I became a member of the Emmett Brigade, which held its meetings at Morgan's beer-shop, in Praed-street,. and one branch in Shouldham-street, kept by Broaden—I know a man named Mullins—I have heard him address meetings of Chartists and Confederates, at Breaden's, on several Sundays, and on Sunday, 13th Aug. I heard him say it was necessary for each man to prepare himself for the crests that was coming, and it was necessary for each man to make a small sacrifice to aid the Committee of Progress in their undertakings, and they would judge by the exertions they made whether they were prepared or not—at a meeting there on Tuesday, 15th Aug., between thirty and forty Chartists and Confederates were present—at one time there were forty—it was staled that they were waiting for delegates from the Committee of Progress—on Wednesday, 16th Aug., about eight o'clock, I went to the Chartist meeting-house in Praed-street—about twenty of the Emmenet Brigade were assembled—it was said that they were waiting for orders; they did not say for what, but it was generally understood for an outbreak—I went from thence to Breaden's, I got there about half-past eight or a quarters to nine, and found thirty or forty persons of the same class—Mullins came in and a man named Smith clapped him on the shoulder, and said, "My boy, I was afraid you were taken"—he said, "No, they only take me with my life'—he retired, and a man named Cruickshank came in and placed a musket on the table—I had seen him there once or twice before—I do not know what branch he was a member of—there were two pistols, and several pikes and pike—heads, in the room—I heard the question put whether they were prepared, and whether they had got their toothpicks, which was the name they gave them—Mullins and others retired into another room—when they came back I was sitting in the angle of the room, and saw Mullins look into the room, and withdraw out of my sight—Smith said to me, but I cannot swear whether it was in Mullin's presence, that they were to be in readiness to meet their leader at Crown-street Soho-square, and the Seven Dials, at ten o'clock—the leader's name was not mentioned—a cab, which I was informed—had brought Mullins, drove up to the door, and he went away in it—I believe there was a question asked how they were to take their arms—the answers in the best way they could—I went to Crown-street, Soho, walked down to the bottom, and recognied about thirty persons whom I had seen in the room.

Cross-examined. Q. What is Mullins? A. I believe he is a surgess—he seems to be a man of education—I think he said crisis, and not cress—was, not in communication with the police when I heard Mullins speak—I am a moral-force Chartist—I think it is not physical means that will carry out moral force.





CHARLES BALDWINSON
. I am a tailor, of Webber-street, Blackfrairs. I became a Chartist last May, and was elected a class-leader about three weeks

afterwards, in June—I had nine men under me—the usual place of meeting was Chartist-hall, Webber-street—Morgan was a class-leader in the same district—I attended at the South Lambeth Chartist-hall—I know Pedley well—he was a class-leader at one time, but gave it up—he used to attend the same meetings—on Tuesday evening, 15th Aug., I went with Morgan to a Chartist meeting at the Peacock, Francis-street, Westminster-road—as we went he told me that during my absence something was going on which I was little aware of, but when I got to the Peacock I should hear something by Mr. Pedley, that something was close at hand—I had not been there for nearly a fortnight—about half an hour after we had been at the Peacock, Pedley came—he said there was a general rising in the North, that a delegate had come from Manchester, and that we were to meet at the Peacock next evening, and bring our men with us armed, and those who were not armed were to be put in a position to get arms—my party was to go to the Broadway, Westminster—Clerkenwell-green, the East end of town, and Seven-dials were also mentioned—Pedley produced some different-coloured ribbons, which the leaders were to wear that they should be known by the men—this is one of them (produced)—next morning I went, and told some of the men what was going to take place—at nearly nine o'clock in the evening I went to the Angel, in Webber-street—Prowton, Con way, Johnson, and Pedley were there—I believe we got there before Pedley—when he came I saw him load a pistol—I saw some cartridges, which he made up at the Peacock on Wednesday night—he gave me one—he left, and the police arrived in about three minutes.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you any arms that night? A. A pike—head and a small pocket-pistol—I knew the men were to be arrested—I took the pistol and pike—head, to take off the appearance of a traitor you may call it—I did-not offer the pistol to any man in the meeting that night—Con way had the pistol in his hand, and was cutting a ball to go into it—he went out for some percussion-caps, but I do not think he had it when be went out—I told my class to meet at the Peacock at eight o'clock, that something was to lake place—I had given information then; I gave them instructions before I gare the information, but I believe not afterwards—they did not suspect me "hen I ceased to do so, as I had none to give, Pedley had to give them that night—I understand they did not think me a spy or a traitor till they were arrested—I told them to come armed if they had them, and if they had not they would be put in the way to get them—I did not know they were to be arrested then—I did not give information till the same evening.

MR. CLERK. Q. You gave information between two and three o'clock? A. Yes—I had not given the least information before that.





NICHOLAS PEARCE
. I am superintendent of the F Division of Police. On 16th Aug;. I went to the Orange Tree public-house with about twenty men—we arrived a little after five o'clock, went into a room in the upper part of the house, and found eleven persons sitting round a table apparently in conversation—I requested them all to keep their seats—I do not think anything was said. but a great many of the constables rushed into the room—more than one attempted to get away—I had a pistol with me—we secured them all—I found a handkerchief under the bench they were sitting on, a little to the left of Ritchie, containing three balls, with tow on the outside tied round, one with a string, some rag and tow saturated with turpentine—I cut one 'ball open, and found some printer's type in the middle—the things all smell of turpentine—found two knives in Ritchie's pocket—I examined him more minutely at me station—his dress and hat smelt of turpentine—he declined giving his address—he told me afterwards he had lately returned from France—the eleven

men were Ritchie Gurney, Sheppard, Abel, Richardson, Burn, Greesskes Scading, Snowball, Martin, and Small

SAMUEL BOHLIN
. I am an undertaker, of Beech-street, Barbican. On Tuesday, 10th Aug., I was put in possession of the Orange Tree—I got then about a quarter to eleven o'clock in the morning—next day, about a quarter to three, a man came and asked if there was a room empty up stairs, as some of his shopmates were going to meet there—the landlady let him the room—two men came about a quarter to four; eleven came altogether—before five they asked me to put the bagatelle-board up—I asked one of them to lend me a hand—we put it up—they asked me for the balls—I said I did not know anything about them; the landlady said they were stolen—one of them took a round bit of chalk from the mantel-piece, and it went into No. 5 hole, which was red—he said, "Red ball, fire, by God, to-night!"—I left the room—they were together about twenty minutes before the police came—they had been talking together, but would not let me hear them; they talked low—on the following morning I found this card in the room—no one had been in the room between the police taking the men and my finding it (this was a card, certifying that Henry Small was entered as a member of the National Chartist Association on July 7th, 1848.

EDWARD KENDALL
. I am a sergeant of the Detective Police. I searched Jones, and found these things—I went to his lodging, and saw Inspector Walker find a cup, containing about seventy bullets, and a stick two feet long, with part of a bayonet on it—I found three pounds of lead and a quantity of metal, apparently pewter-pots melted down; that would make bullets—here is the handle of a pewter-pot in the lump.

JOHN JENKINSON
 (policeman).—On the evening of 16th Aug., about half-past eight o'clock, I was in plain clothes in front of Cartwright's coftee-shop?—I had been at Chartist meetings there, and knew it was the place of meeting of the Cripplegate locality of Chartists—I found about forty people in front of the house, mostly Irish labourers and the poorer class of people—about midnight I saw Payne coming in a dirceion from Cartwright's, with one of the people like lish labourers—I followed and watched him talking to a number of them for about ten minutes—he went away with two others.





JOSEPH HONY
 (policemen). I am on the Seven Dials beat. On wednesday evening. 16th Aug., I was on my beat, and saw a number of persons about in small parties in unusual numbers—must of them were strangers—

there were about twenty at first—they increased to about fifty or sixty—it was then a quarter past nine o'clock—I reported to superintendent Pearce, and an inspector was sent.

Cross-examined. Was that an unusual thing in that neighbourhood. A. Yes, to see so many strangers.





HENRY JONES

THOMAS MOLLISON
. I am a labourer at Shouldham-street, Bryanstone-square, next door to Breadon's coffee-shop. I can see into Breadon's from my room—on 16th Aug., about half-past seven o'clock, I was at my window, and saw ten or twelve people about Breadon's door—they came in fours and fives, and increased to eighty or a hundred, walking backwards and forwards—I saw the room crowded with people—there were about forty—I saw a bright instrument forced up above their heads—I could only see about four or five inches of metal, as a man's shoulder prevented me—it was a steel blade—I went to the Police-office, and gave information.

Cross-examined. Q. Was there anything unusual in seeing that room full of people? A. I had never seen it so full before.





JOHN BAMBRIDGE

SAMUEL EVANS
 (police-inspector). I searched Mrs. Heath's, the Temperance coffee-house, on 16th Aug.—it is in the same street as the Lord Denman.





WILLIAM RANDALL
. I am in the employ of Mr. Darby, an artist in fireworks. I have examined these balls—I opened one, and found it to contain about two or two and a half ounces of gunpowder, and some old nails this attached to it seems to be a slow-match—if a light were applied to that match it would be some time before it exploded—if it exploded in a crowd, probably the old nails would wound people's legs, and if thrown into a room there would be a great smoke, and it would probably set fire to the room—but if thrown in an open place it would be quite harmless—the slow-match enables a person to hold it in their hand to light it, and then it any where—I should say this match would probably burn half a minute—the outside is made of paper, with a sort of wax—if it was more confined it would be more destructive.





NICHOLAS PEARCE

re-examined. I was present when the prisoner made a statement before the Magistrate—this is Mr. Henry's signature to it—(read—The prisoncr says, "I do not wish to stand here as an English factionist, but as an Irish nationalist; my object was, not to disturb English sowty, but to free my own country; I feel very well my position, and I

mean to abide by the consequences; I carried on the business of 3 portriat-painter at Nassau-street, Middlesex-hospital.")

MR. KENEALEY
called






JOHN ENGLISH
. I know the prisoner—this paper of hieroglyphics (No. 11) is not my writing, but it is an exact copy of the original, which I wrote—I wrote it without any reference to the Charter—I and the prisoner agreed to hold a correspondence in hieroglyphics, and I gave this cipher to the prisoner for that purpose, as a short-hand means of correspondence—there was no use made of it at all with respect to the Charter—I gave it him without any solicitation on his part—my letters had been opened by the Post-office, and this was a plan I thought of, to write—it was more as a pastime, or a little amusement—I am not a Chartist, and I do not believe the prisoner is—I gave him the paper for no other purpose than my own private correspondence.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. What are you? A. lithographic printer, and live at 18, High-street, Marylebone—I have lived there a week or two—before that, I lived at 27, East-street, Manchester-square, for a week or so—before that I was in Ireland for about five weeks—I gave this paper to the prisoner the day before I went to Ireland—I went to Tipperary, Dublin, Kildare, and other parts of the country—I was not at Slievenamon—I know the name of it—I have the honour of being an Irish-man, but was born in London—I am a Confederate—I believe the prisoners was one, but I cannot say—I know the Davis Club, and was a member of it: the prisoner was secretary—persons must be Confederates to be members of the Davis Club—I did not go to Ireland to take views for the Illustrated London News; I went to see my friends—they live in Tipperary; some in Ceshel some in the town of Tipperary, and so on—I believed my letters have been opened at the Post-office—I am not a suspected person—I saw a letter, when I went to Ireland, that had evidently been opened; there was a receipt in it of a subscription to St. Ann's Society, directed to a gentleman in the "York-road, Westminster, which could not have got into my letter unless it had been opened—I had not been to Ireland for some years, and went to see my friends.

Q. I want an explanation of a few of these words—"Pikes," "Rife," "Killed," "Barricades," "O'Brien," "Mahoney," "Doheney," "Tippenry," "Poison," "Fire," "English:" what did you want these words for to correspond with your friend in London? A. I believed, from reading the papers here, that Ireland was in a state of insurrection, and it was necessary to use all these horrible words if I wished to give my friend a correct account of the state of things in Ireland—I intended making a list afterwards; in a dictionary perhaps—I wanted to make a short-hand of my own—it was shorter to write in cipher instead of putting the words in full—I bad a dislike to having my letters read at the Post-office, and 1 did it that they might not be read, and also that it might be shorter—it was purely for the purpose of giving the prisoner an account of the state of affairs in Ireland, and it is a sort of satisfaction to baffle persons who read your letters—this is the prisoner's handwriting—it is an exact copy of the one I wrote—I cannot read the short-hand which is at the bottom: it is a little scribbling—I did not see Doheney when I was in Ireland—I was living-at 88, Long Acre, before 1 went, for a few months before that in Milton-credent, Euston-square—I was in the employement of Mr. Moody, a lithographic printer, at 257, Holborn, and am so—I was an articled pupil to him, and have been with him nearly four years—I do not know Mullns—I never lodged with him; I have seen him—I did not go away with him—I did not see him when he was away, avoiding his arrest.


MR. KEVEALEY. Q. On your oath, bad you any disloyal purpose in giving that paper to the prisoner? A. No; it was merely for the purposes of correspondence—I perhaps should not have done it bad my letters not been opened.





JOHN ATKINSON
. I am a law-stationer, of Chancery-lane. I have known the prisoner twelve or thirteen months—during that time I have had reason to believe him to be a perfectly loyal subject of Her Majesty—I never beard him express any seditious or disloyal sentiments.





JAMES GILBERT
. I am a sculptor. I have known Dowling nearly ten years—I have had opportunities of knowing his sentiments on political subjects—I know no person who could have a better opportunity—we lived in the same room together—I never believed him to be a Chartist—I have heard him say be never agreed with the Charter—if he had I should have known it—I never heard him use disloyal language in private—I cannot say in public—I have very seldom heard him speak in public—he was a very quiet, retiring, reserved young man.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Do you know that he was the secretary of the Davis Club? A. Yes—I know him to be an Irish Repealer—I used to pay a subscription to the Irish Repeal Association—I have heard him speak in public—I never heard him use disloyal language—three times is the very most I have heard him, and that was in one place, and daring those three times I never heard him utter anything disloyal or seditious—I meant by private when I was sitting in his company—I never beard him in public or private say anything disloyal.





JAMES BARRY
. I have known Dowling about fifteen months—I am a member of the Repeal club of which he was the secretary—that club never appointed a delegate to the Chartists—I was a member of the Davis Club—the rules of that club were settled by two eminent lawyers, Sir Colman O'Loughlin and Sir Robert Holmes, and revised by Mr. Anstey, M. P. for Youghal, who was a member of the club—that club was dissolved for the purpose of being incorporated with the Irish League on the motion of Dowling—I can swear that body was for moral force—Dowling introduced a resolution approving of the principles of the Irish League—that club was bound to legal agitation.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. How long were you a member of the club? A. About fifteen months—I remember Mr. Doheney being there, and addressing the meeting—it was the Confederation at that time—that is the same Doheney we now hear of in Ireland—I do not think he was a member of the Irish League—he was not of the Davis Club—he was there as a visitor—he came from Ireland—I cannot say whether he came as a deputation—he was received with great approbation—I do not know whether Dowling was there—he was not secretary then—he became so about 2nd—May—a person named Crowe was a member—I was present last Session when he was convicted—I was present at the meeting when he delivered the speech on which he was convicted—I do not recollect whether Dowling was there—it was alleged that Crowe was present when somebody read a paper with the expression, "to hell with the Queen "—it was I that read that.

MR. KENEALEY. Q. Now explain it. A. I was reading the last accounts from Ireland in the Evening Express, and there was a report of a man who was taken up in Limerick on a charge of being drunk and using seditious language, and with saying, "To hell with the Queen "—some persons laughed when it was read, but there was no cheering or any manifestation of applause I was in Court when those words were proved—Mr. Parry called

no witnesses—I was prepared to swear Crowe never uttered those words—my reading them was brought in evidence against Crowe.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. What are you? A. I am a tailor, and have lived at 18, High-street,—Marylebone, about a fortnight—before that I lived in East-street, Manchester-square, I lived there four or five months—before—that I lived at 83, Wells-street, Oxford-street, with a man named Dempsey—I have not been in Ireland for eight years—I am not a Chartist—I went to the Repeal meetings—the Repealers held their meetings at the same home as the Chartists, but on different nights—there was no connection between the two bodies—they never communicated with each other to my knowledge—I was not present in Dean-street when Looney was sent as a deputation; to the Chartists—he was a member—he was convicted last Session—I was present at his speech which they called seditious—I did not go to the police and tell them seditious speeches were being made—I did not consider myself a judge of a seditious speech—I never heard of Looney going from the Davis Club to the Chartist's hall, Lambeth—he did not belong to Dean-street—I never bought arms in my life—I raffled a musket a month or it weeks ago—Mahoney won it—my brother gave it me—he said it was unless to him, and I could raffle it if I thought proper—he is a tailor, and lives at 37, Lark-street, Manchester-square—I raffled it to get rid of it—it was quite useless to me—twenty-eight people put their names down—that would be 28s.—they were not Confederates—I do not believe Mahoney is a members of the Davis Club—he was not a member of any club that I am aware of—I know nothing of the Felon Club or where it held its meetings—I think Mahoney is a tailor, and that his name is Timothy—I do not not know when he lives—I know several of the persons who raffled—there was a gentleman named Sturgeon, and John Callahan, and my brother—they used to go to the Three Tuns, in Moor-street, Seven Dials—the Confederates never met there that I am aware of—it is kept by Naigle—I believe Callahan is a printer—he was a member of the club—I do not know that Sturgeon was; I do not know his Christian name or where he lives, I have seen him in the club—there was a man named Fox, I do not know where he lived, and a man named use-Carey, who lived, I think, in Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square—he is a printer, and was a member of our club.





MR. LE PLAISTERER
. I am a watch-maker, of Chancery-lane. I have known Dowling about eleven months—I have never heard him espress any seditious or disloyal language—I have seen him six or eight times.

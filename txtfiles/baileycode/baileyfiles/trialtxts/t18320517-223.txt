            . I go out charing; my husband's name is Joseph; I have known the prisoner for two years - I have employed her the last two months to take care of my children
 while I was out; I missed some odd stockings out of a box to which she had access - I spoke to her about them; she said she had taken them; I never allowed her to take them - I think she took the best of them; I told her if she would give me them back I would not hurt her - she told the officer where they were.
RICHARD COLLINS (Police-constable G 124). I went to a house in Playhouse-yard, by the prisoner's direction, and found these stockings and this box-iron.(Property produced and sworn to.)

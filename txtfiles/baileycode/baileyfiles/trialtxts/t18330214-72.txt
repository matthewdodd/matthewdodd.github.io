 - I have one partner. On the 16th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I was behind my counter, and saw the prisoner come to the door, and take a roll of flannel from the lobby - there were thirty-four yards of it - I pursued, and never lost sight of him; I saw him drop it.

            . I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner pass with the flannel under his arm - I turned, and saw the prosecutor come out of his shop - I saw the prisoner drop the flannel.

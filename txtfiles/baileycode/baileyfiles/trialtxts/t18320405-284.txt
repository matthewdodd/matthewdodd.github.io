             (Policeman K 7.) On the 28th of March, about two o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise at the back of Providence-place, Bethnal-green - I got over a wall at the back of Chamberlain's house, and found a cap with eight eggs in it - I looked into the privy, and found the two prisoners there with a live tame rabbit and two fowls in a bag; I took them to the station - Chamberlain saw the property next morning, and claimed it.

            . I live at No. 8, Providence-place


 - I know nothing of the prisoners. I lost this property from my premises on the 28th of March, and found them at the station-house, with this rabbit and fowls, which are mine - the cap belongs to the premises; the hen was setting on nine eggs.
Lovell's Defence. I was at the play, and got over into these premises to sleep - I went into the privy; two men jumped over, we saw the eggs laying down, and put them into the cap.
LOVELL -

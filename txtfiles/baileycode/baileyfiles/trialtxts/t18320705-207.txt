            . I am shopman to Mr. Samuel Morgan, a glover and hosier
, in the Strand


. On the 26th of June the prisoner came to purchase a pair of brown cotten stockings; I showed him two parcels - he selected a pair at 1s. 6d. - he gave me 2s., and while I was getting a sixpence from the till, he snatched a parcel of handkerchiefs from the counter, and concealed them under a parcel in his arms; I came round the counter - he saw that I noticed him, and he ran out; I pursued: the officer saw and pursued him - he threw the handkerchiefs down and the stockings which he had bought.

 was indicted

19th of August, 1 table-cloth, value 2s.; 3 towels, value 2s.; 2 bed-curtains, value 4s.; and 1 handkerchief, value 1s.; the goods of 



Joshua Frederick Clements, her master.






JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS
. I am a victualler, and live in Dean-street, Soho. The prisoner was about three months in my service—she left me, and I missed these articles from my bed-room, which nobody but her had access to.





JOHN ALLEN
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Clare-street. I produce a tablecloth, pawned, I believe, by the prisoner, but I am not positive, on the 2nd of September, in the name of Ann Welch—the duplicate I gave was found on her.





ISAAC TURVEY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody—the towels and curtains have not been found—she took the duplicate of the table-cloth from her pocket-book, as I took her to the station-house, and tried to make away with it.

(Property produced and sword to.)

Prisoner's Defence. He had several lodgers who might take the things—I was not aware the table-cloth was in my bundle.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

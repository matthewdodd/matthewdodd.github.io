 ; our house was broke open on the eleventh of August last, all was fast over night; and in the morning , we found our area door broke open. Then they had the cellar door to get through, and then it was but lifting up the latch to get into the kitchen. I got up about six, but my family was all up before me. I miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment, mentioning each, and what value. The prisoners were taken up, and Jos. Stanley told me he had given my apron to

            . I took up Stanley, on suspicion of robbing my master the prosecutor, on the Thursday after the robbery; he had work'd with my master, I left him in custody of the beadle, and went and search'd his lodgings. The first thing I found was the belows; he lodg'd at the house of William Green; by looking about, I found every thing mentioned in the indictment, exclusive of the spoon and money.

             told me, they all lay together. By searching farther, we found a box concealed, and in it things belonging to other prosecutors; then we went to Stanley, and told him what we had found; he said, he could not help it now it was done, and denied any body's being concern'd with him. Then we took him before justice Fielding, and there he own'd the fact; and he had my master's hat on his head, at the same time. I never saw Groom, before I saw him before justice Fielding.
Q. Did he confess any thing?
East. I never heard him confess any thing belonging to this indictment.

WILLIAM SHARP
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of June, 1 watch, value 5l. 10s.; 1 collar, 10s.; and 1 handkerchief, 5s.; the goods of 



James Comfort; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES COMFORT
. I live in Milner-street, Islington. I had a watch and a collar safe—the watch hung over the bed-room mantel-piece—this is my watch—we missed these things on Monday, the 26th of June.





JAMES STRACHAN
 (police-constable N 187.) I produce this watch—I found it about three o'clock in the morning lying on the ground, where the prisoner was apprehended, in a passage leading to some gardens, at the back of Milner-street—I have a key to that passage, it being on my beat—I found this collar and handkerchief in the same place—I had seen the prisoner come sliding down a ladder in front of Mr. Comfort's house, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night—I asked what he wanted there—he said he had been to see that the tops were all secure, and that he lived at the corner house—I said, "I will go with you and see"—he then jumped over the railings—I chased him round, and he got up the ladder again—I went up after him, and he threatened to throw me down—I was obliged to come down—he was taken about eleven o'clock.





EDMUND CHICHELEY
 (police-constable N 199.) I saw the prisoner on the top of some houses in Gibson-square—we surrounded him, and he went to an empty house, No. 17—he came out of there, and we took him—I found this screw-driver and this brooch near where he was taken.

Prisoner. I heard a cry, and went round like other people.





THOMAS TRINGHAM
 (police-sergeant B 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

I am foreman of this shop, on the 25th of September last, the starch an d blue mentioned in the indictment, was lost out of the gateway adjoining the shop, which we use as a warehouse; I was at work in the shop, and two young men informed me of the loss; I followed them, and I saw the prisoners Jones and Taylor; Jones had the goods upon him; I took him by the collar, and asked him how he came by them, and he said, he picked them up in the street; the starch was with a tun more, and the blue I saw not a quarter of an hour before, the starch is rather particular, having been dried in a stove that smoaked it more than common, and the papers are blacker than common.
Court. Is it dried after it is in papers? - Yes: The other young man denied any knowledge of his companion.

I know the prisoner very well, I had seen Taylor two mornings before on the very same spot, on the 25th of September, I saw the prisoners very nigh to Mr. Sutton's, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was going about my master's business, and I saw Jones and Taylor skulking about as if about no good, I saw Jones go in first into the gateway, he was in for about half a minute, and Taylor followed him, I saw Jones come out, and he had the property in his apron: I am sure I saw something in his apron: Taylor was in about a quarter of a minute; they both came out together, Taylor had nothing in his lap, nor any thing about him that I saw.
How long had they been together before they went into this gateway? - About five or ten minutes, they walked up and down Garlick Hill three or four times, me and my fellow prentice (

PRISONER JONES's DEFENCE.
I saw these things lay, I picked them up, I was walking along the street, and a man came and asked me what I had there; he asked me if I knew one Mr. Sutton, I said, no; I never saw Taylor before I was in gaol, he was near an hundred or two hundred yards before me, I have my master here that I served my time with.
PRISONER TAYLOR's DEFENCE.
I went to seek my cousin that morning, and just as I turned round the corner, I saw this young fellow laid hold on, and they said, I was with him: We had not been together.
Court to Martin and Petrie. Are you sure these two young men were walking up and down Garlick Hill together? - It is true that they were together walking up and down.
The Prisoner Taylor called three witnesses who gave him a good character.

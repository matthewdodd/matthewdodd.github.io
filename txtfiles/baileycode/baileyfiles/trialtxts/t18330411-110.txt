                  , from his person
            .
CHARLES GREVILLE PRIDEAUX. I am a student at law
, and live at No. 15, Calthorpe-street. On the 30th of March I was in Fleet-street


; I did not feel my handkerchief taken - I received information, felt my pocket, and immediately missed it - I knew I had it on my person an hour before; it was produced to me, and I am certain it is mine - I know it by its appearance and wear; I am not aware that I saw the prisoners.

            . I am a City Policeman. On the 30th of March, between two and three o'clock, I was near St. Dunstan's church, and saw the prisoners, in company with another, following Mr. Prideaux and a gentleman who was with him; I saw Smith draw the handkerchief from Mr. Prideaux's pocket, and hand it to Waddilove - I immediately crossed over, and seized both of them; Waddilove immediately dropped the handkerchief by his side - I stooped and picked it up; I told a person to call Mr. Prideaux, which he did, and he claimed the handkerchief.
Smith's Defence. I was looking for a situation, and in Fleet-street this young man was before me. The Policeman took us, but I was not in his company.
Waddilove's Defence. I had nothing about me.

            . Aged 18.
WADDILOVE - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 19.

HENRY BAKER
 was indicted

for breaking and entering the dewelling-house of 



Sophia Baker, on the 
19th of September, at 
St. Paul, Deptford, and stealing therein 2 sovereigns, and 1 5l. Bank-note; the monies and property of 



John Shirt.






JOHN SHIRT
. I had a 5l. note two sovereigns in a deal box—I placed it in the care of Mrs. Baker—It was locked, and I kept the key.





SOPHIA BAKER
. I received a deal box from the last witness, which I kept in my bed room—the prisoner is my son—I live at Detford.





SOPHIA BAKER, JUN
. Last Saturday my mother was out. I went out and met my brother in the Broadway, alone—he asked me for the key to open the room door—he said he was going to put on a new shirt—I gave him the key—I came home soon afterwards, and found the key in the door—I went into the house—I had seen Mr. Shirt's deal box thers before—when I came home I saw it was broken open, and the money was gone—I went down to my mother.





WILLIAM DYKE
. I am a policeman. In consequence of information, I went to Astley's Theatre on Saturday, the 19th of September, and apprehended the prisoner—I found on him a £5 note, four half-crown, and three shilling—I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Deptford, and asked if he had got a £5 note—he said, "You fool! what do you think I do with a £5 note?"—I searched him, and found it on him.


MR. SHIRT. This is my £5 note. I know it by the number, and the name on it.




GUILTY of stealing in the dwelling-house, but not of breaking and entering, Aged 17.—


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Recorder.

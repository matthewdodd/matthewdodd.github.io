            . I live at Dalston


. On the 19th of December in the morning, I discovered the rain-water pipe and trunk were stolen from a building at the back of my house, and found the prisoner in custody next day with it - it was fixed to a green-house attatched to my house.

            . I am a plumber. I was at work for Mr. Leigh, and found the pipe gone, it was safe the day before. In the evening as I went to town I followed the prisoner with a bag upon his back, gave him in charge, and asked him what was in his bag? he said it was tin; I found it was the lead - it fitted the place.

BENNETT BARRELL. I am a milkman
, and live in Mountzion, Clerkenwell


 - I have a stable, which is walled round. On the 9th of April I found the door open - I waited a minute, and saw Thomas Osborn getting over the wall; I ran, and asked what he was doing - he said he was only sitting on the wall; I did not see him do any thing. I lost a saddle, bridle, and a pair of reins; I found where they were sold; I cannot be sure whether it was Thomas or Charles who I saw on the wall.

            . I am a watchman. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house; Thomas confessed to me that he had carried the harness to his brother and Stephenson - that it was Mr. Barrell's, and had been sold in St. John-street-road - that he took it out of the yard, and when he saw Mr. Barrell he said, "It was your harness - I carried it to my brother and Stephenson, and they sold it;" I did not understand him to say he took it from the premises, but from their own house.

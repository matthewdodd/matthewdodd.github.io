            . I am a turner
, and live in Long-lane


. On the 30th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, a woman was passing my shop-door, and told me something was taken out of my shop-window. I went in pursuit with my two sons, turned towards Aldersgate-street, ran back again, and heard my son say,
"I have got him!" When I came up, I found he had the prisoner in custody with the skittle-ball, which was missing out of the window.

            . I met our apprentice, and ran after the man to the top of Long-lane, saw the prisoner down Hare-court. Just as he turned, I saw him stoop down; my brother picked the skittle-ball up from between his legs. A man stopped him - I am sure he is the man.

            . I went in pursuit, and saw the prisoner with the ball under his coat. I followed him down Aldersgate-street, up Hare-court, where he stopped, put the ball down, and ran away; I picked it up. My brother collared him at the end of the lane. I am sure he is the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . In consequence of some suspicions I entertained, I took the prisoner up stairs to his box, and told him to open it; he hesitated, and said, he had lost the key. I told him to break it open with a hammer, which he did, and I found all the articles mentioned in the indictment, in the box. I knew the flannel to be mine, for it exactly fitted a piece to which it apparently belonged, by the jaggs, and it not being cut straight. (The two pieces of flannel were here produced, compared, and appeared to correspond.) I can swear to all the articles except two remnants of corderoy. to which I cannot positively swear. (The property, except the corderoy, was here produced, and sworn to.) The bits of calico were cut out of breeches pockets, and I had a great many such. The other calico corresponds in the folds with some calico which I have by me; and to the best of my belief, all the property is mine.

            . I took the prisoner into custody.
The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.

EDWARD THOMAS. I keep livery stables

. On the evening of the 1st of March I saw the prisoner come out of the coach-house, with two cushions under each arm - he was a stranger. I was in the harness room - I came down as quick as I could, and overtook him in Piccadilly, with them; I stopped him, brought him back to my stable, and gave him in charge. My brother William is in partnership with me.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, about six o'clock in the evening - he made great resistance, but did not deny the charge.

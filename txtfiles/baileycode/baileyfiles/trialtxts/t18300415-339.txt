WILLIAM HALL. On the 20th of March, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Cheapside


, and heard the officer call, Stop sir! - I turned round and he was scuffling with the prisoner, who I saw throwing my handkerchief down; I had not felt it taken.

            . I am an officer. I was in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner in company with another, following close behind a gentleman - I followed him a few yards, then saw him put his left hand into the gentleman's pocket,' take his handkerchief and secrete it under his coat; I collared him, he struggled to get away, and at the same time threw the handkerchief behind him - the other ran off; I called the gentleman, who took the handkerchief up and gave it to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a person run across the road - I had not gone two steps before this man took me, and he laid down the handkerchief himself.

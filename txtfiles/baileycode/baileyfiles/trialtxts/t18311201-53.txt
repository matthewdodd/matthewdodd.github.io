TAVERNER JOHN MILLER. I live in Old Compton-street, Soho. On the afternoon of the 25th of November, I was passing through Lincoln's Inn Old-square


; I felt a little knock against me - I put my hand to my pocket, and missed a silk handkerchief: I turned round, and saw the prisoner walking at a short distance from me; I saw no other person near me - I followed him, accused him of having taken my handkerchief, and requested permission to search his pockets, which he allowed, denying that he had any thing; I could not find any thing on him, but having some suspicion I requested him to walk with me- he made some resistance, and I collared him: he broke from me, and ran away - I pursued, and saw him throw down my handkerchief; he was then taken.

            . I am servant to James Butler, who lives in High-street, Shadwell, and is a cheesemonger
. I was at Mr. Hopkes' door, in Ratcliff-highway


, about ten o'clock at night on the 15th of December, with my master's horse and chaise - this coat was in it; the prisoner, (whom I had known for some time), with three other persons, came from the public-house next door, and began a sham fight, before the horse's head; I went to the horse to quiet him, and the prisoner went to the back of the chaise, and drew the coat out - I pursued him to Old Gravel-lane, where I took the coat from him, and made a strike at him - he left the coat, and got away; I called to the officer to stop him.

            . I am an officer. I was in Ratcliff-highway on this night, with Furlong. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he dropped the coat - King took it up. I pursued, and took him - there was no person near him.

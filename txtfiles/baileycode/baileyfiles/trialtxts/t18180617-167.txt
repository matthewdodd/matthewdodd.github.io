            . I keep a green-shop
, in Cable-street, Wells-street


. On the 18th of May, at ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner take the tub of oysters out of my shop-window. I went up the court after him; the women would not let Herod shew me the house where he was. When I went up the court, the prisoner came out, and beat me cruelly to get Wilkins from me.

            . I saw the prisoner take the tub of oysters from the prosecutor's window, and run down Bailey's-court with them. I am sure he is the man. I followed him, but the women at the top of the court would not let me go down.

ROBERT SWAINE JOHNSON
. On the 7th of January, a little before ten o'clock at night, I was a little below Shoe-lane, in Holborn—I had a handkerchief in my pocket—James Holland came from behind me, and asked if I had lost my handkerchief—I felt, and said I had—he said if I would go with him, he had got a person in custody—we had not got many yards when we met the watchman with the prisoner—my handkerchief was Pro-duced in the watchhouse.





JOHN HOLLAND
. I am a grocer. I was going to my brother's, in the Haymarket, and saw the prisoner turn sharp round the corner of Farringdon-street, and follow the prosecutor—I saw him lift his coat flap, and take his handkerchief—I secured him before he got six yards, and gave him to the watchman, and went after the prosecutor.






EDWARD EXTON
. I am the watchman. Holland gave me this handkerchief and the prisoner in charge.
(Properly produced and sworn to)

Prisoner. I picked it up.

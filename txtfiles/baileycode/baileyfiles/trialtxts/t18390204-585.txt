WILLIAM HORSFORD
. I live in Adam-street East, Manchester-square. On the 24th of January I was in the Strand—I saw the prisoners in company with another person—Mr. Underdown was looking in at a window in the Strand, near to Somerset-house—I saw the prisoner Carney take a pocket-handkerchief out of his great coat pocket—the other two were standing behind him—I had watched them in company together, coming down the Strand—when Carney had taken the handkerchief they

walked away together, and Carney gave the handkerchief to Davis—they then crossed the road—I went and caught the two prisoners—Carney resisted, and the inspector came up, he took one of them, and I kept the other—Davis threw down the handkerchief when I took hold of him.

Davis. I never had any handkerchief in my possession.





JOHN BOYS UNDERDOWN
. I live at Marden, in Kent. I was stopping at the Spread Eagle—this is my handkerchief—I was looking in a printshop, and felt a tug at my pocket—I missed my handkerchief, and was going on, about to put up with the loss of it, when I heard of this.

Davis. I was not near the gentleman—the witness is mistaken—I do not know this young man—I was coming the other way.

CARNEY—


GUILTY
. Aged 17.

DAVIS—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.

JOHN MARTIN
. I keep the Noah's Ark public-house, Harrow-street, Limehouse. I missed my till on the 1st of August—I saw it safe five minutes before—there were two shillings, two sixpences, and the other money in it—I ran up Noah's Ark Alley and saw the prisoner with it on his shoulder—I said, "I have caught you, have I? this is an old game"—he said, "No, this is the first time"—the policeman found on him 9s. 3 3/4 d. in all.

Prisoner. I was very much distressed—I had been out of the House of Correction a month—I was there for stealing a quilt.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

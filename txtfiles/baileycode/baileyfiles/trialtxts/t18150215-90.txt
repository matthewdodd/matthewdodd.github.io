                  JOHN 
                  COOK
               



            , JUNIOR. I am a warehouseman and silk manufacturer
; we carry on our business in Crown-court, Cheapside


; the partners


 in the firm are 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



            , senior, 
               
                  John 
                  Townshend
               



            , and 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



            , junior, myself; we have no other partner. The prisoner was our porter
. On the 7th of January, I returned home at twelve at night, on Sunday night, I was informed the porters had been passing the day disorderly; I was determined to get rid of them all; Smith and Clinch were both in bed, in separate rooms; I desired them to deliver up their keys; Clinch gave up his keys regularly; the prisoner did not. I desired them to give up their keys as they were dressing themselves; my uncle, 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



            , was not at home at that time. I was up with Clinch to look for a pocket-book; Clinch opened his box in my presence, all was fair as far as I had an opportunity to see with him; when I returned the prisoner had left his keys in his chest, he had been at his chest during my absence, he was still in his room with his chest; when I returned, his key was left in his chest; he was still in the warehouse, where his chest was. I saw him take several papers from his chest, he went away with them in his hand, I did not stop him; I had been absent from the prisoner with Clinch ten minutes; my brother was with the prisoner, and saw what he was doing in the warehouse. Immediately upon the prisoner leaving the house, I saw a short length of white quilting, such as we dealt in, it was under the prisoner's packing counter; this piece of quilting could not have got there by accident.
Q. In consequence of something told you by your brother, did you go any where - A. To Mrs. Taylor, in Maiden-lane; I found a letter in his box
"addressed to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Wakefield
               



            , London"
"thanking him for his kind present, and they saying they had sent him a turkey." Upon a ring that he left in his box was three keys and a seal.
Q. What salary did you give him - A. Twenty-six pounds a year board and lodging.
Q. In consequence of this you made some enquires of Mrs. Taylor, I believe - A. Yes, on Sunday at eight o'clock in the morning, concerning Miss Birfield, a friend of the prisoner's; she directed me to her daughter, Mrs. Hawkins, in Wellington-street, City-road, and to 
               
                  William 
                  Page
               



            , as persons likely to give me information. I met the prisoner in Aldersgate-street after I had been at Mrs. Taylor's; I asked him where 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Birfield
               



             lived, the lady he kept company with; he replied, 8, or 9, Castle-street, Rotherithe. I went to Rotherithe; I could not find any such place as Castle-street, Rotherithe. The next day I found Castle-street, in the Borough, where Birfield did live. The prisoner came to our house on Sunday after I had been to Rotherhithe, he asked me to let him take some things out of his chest; I consented, and went into the warehouse with him; he put on his great coat, and took out a neckcloth, and other things. I told himto call on the next day, when my uncle would be at home. I told him that Mrs. Taylor told me that he had given several presents to Sarah Birfield. On Monday, the 9th, my uncle was in town. The prisoner came in about eleven o'clock, my uncle and I were present. I told him that Mrs. Taylor told me that he had given several presents to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Birfield
               



            ; he denied it.
Q. In consequence of what 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Birfield
               



             said, did you get a piece of sattin of her from her mother and father's house - A. Yes, and it tallied with the sattin in our possession. She told me that she gave the prisoner four shillings and sixpence or five shillings to purchase the sattin for her, and this was the sattin that he had brought for her. The prisoner denied ever having stolen the sattin from our premises at first; afterwards he confessed it; we neither promissed or threatened him; he afterwards confessed that he had stolen it from our warehouse, and by some means we found some of our property in the house of Mrs. Bellis; I saw her deliver it up to the officer.
Q. Did you show that property to the prisoner - A. I believe we did; it was black silk velvet and bandana handkerchiefs, to the amount of ten pounds, the different articles I have named, they are here. He acknowledged he had given them to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Birfield
               



            , part was our property, and part the property of Mr. Sower and Hall, with whom he had lived before he came to us; he said that was all he knew of, nothing else. We found some trunks on a further discovery.
Q. How many trunks - A. Three boxes, and some paper parcels; these paper parcels had our private mark on the outside of them, and just done up as they came from the manufacturer, and more paper parcels were found in the boxes; the parcels were such as we had missed from our warehouse.
Q. Had you opened accounts with the prisoner - A. No, nothing of the kind.
Q. What was the value of the property you so found - A. Five hundred and eighty pounds of our own property, and about one hundred and forty pounds of Mr. Sower's; Mr. Sower has the pocket-book, and there is a letter addressed to Mr. Sawer.

                  SOWER
               



            . Q. The prisoner, I understand was in your service, before he went into the prosecutor's service - A. He was, I recommended him and I believed him to be an honest man, when some boxes were produced from a house in Stampford street, at the Mansion house, I saw in one of them a pocket book, the hand writing of the prisoner, it is an invoice, a sort of a memorandum of goods, in it there is a statement of five different sums; in is hand writing. Box No. 1. delivered to Barnfield 300 l. Mr. Nalder produces the boxes at the Mansion house on Tuesday, in one of the boxes I found this book, box No. 2. 86 l. 16 s. 1 d. with the letter P. opposite to that P. I apprehend for page, P. box. 128 l. 13 s. 7 d. P. parcel, No. 4. I believe this to be the hand writing of the prisoner.
Q, After this the prisoner was committed into custody - A. Yes.
Q. Did you at any time receive a letter from the prisoner - A. I did.

                  NALDER
               



            . I have had the boxes and parcels in my custody, there is no number outside of this box, it was opened by Mr. Cook, with a key he had of the prisoner; the whole of these parcels were inclosed in this new flannel.
Mr. Cook. The greatest part of the property in this box, I can swear to. Forty-four yards of white sattin, that is our property, twelve yards of yard wide crape, one of the packages contains four pieces of yard wide crape, this is black silk mode, and black silk sarsnet, twenty-six yards of shot sarsnet, another piece of the same, nineteen silk tippets, five silk shawls; this parcel was sealed up, sealed with W. P. on the outside, 
               W. 
            & P. in large characters; all these except the crapes were inclosed in the flannel wrapper.
Q. to Mr. Cook. Do you mean to say all the articles you have spoke of, to be the property of you and your partner's - A. Yes, they are worth about fifty pounds, there are two other boxes, I believe the whole of the contents of them to be our property. they were produced before the Alderman at the prisoner's examination.
Q. What was the value of the whole - A. About five hundred and ninety seven pounds.
Q. to Mr. Sower. Did you receive a letter from the prisoner - A. I did while he was in the Poultry Compter.
(The letter read.)
"William Page has the service of the goods, he was my accomplice, he has removed the goods, he is the person who took them to the house; the Barfield's are innocent, they did not know they were stolen goods, they were told they were smuggled goods, there is no person concerned but him with me."
MR. NALDER. I found this box in Guildford street, over Black-friars-bridge.
MR. SOWER. I received this letter, after he was examined before the Alderman, I believe it to be his hand writing,
(The letter read.)
"Box, 2. has been removed by P. into some street, near Guildford street; he never told me the number The goods he had in his possession made one or two parcels, the remainder he fetched away from me, and meaned to destroy them. I never sold any thing to receive any thing for them, what I did give were for presents; if I can call to mind any thing else, I will write if Mr. Sower were to call to ask me any questions, perhaps I can recollect, better than to write."

On Sunday the 8th of January, Page came to me in Bennett-street, he did not bring the boxes, I recommended him to Mrs. Battley the same Sunday evening. Mr. Battley, lives at 39, Guildford street.

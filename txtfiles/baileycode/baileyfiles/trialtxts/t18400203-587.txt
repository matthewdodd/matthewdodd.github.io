JOHN LOVEGROVE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of January, 1 handkerchief, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



James Palmer, from his person.






JAMES PALMER
. I am a hatter, and live in Earl-street, Lisson-grove. About a quarter after eight o'clock in the evening, on the 9th of January, I was walking near St. Giles's church—I felt a tug at my pocket, and turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I had seen it safe a quarter of an hour before—he threw it down at my feet—I picked it up, followed him, and he was taken—it was not an instant from my feeling the handkerchief go, and seeing it in his hand—in going along; he implored me to forgive him—I said I should not, having lost four or five handkerchiefs about the same spot.





SAMUEL RUTHERFORD
 (police-constable F 118.) I was called, and took the prisoner—he resisted very violently, and tried to throw me down—he said if he could get his hands loose, and get his knife out, he would rip my b—y guts up—I found another handkerchief on him—I asked what mark was on it—he said, "C H"—I found a different mark on it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in one of the courts out of the street—the gentleman came, and said I took the handkerchief.
(James Dumond, a perfumer, of Burlington-gardens, the prisoner's master; and Matilda Beattie, Star-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

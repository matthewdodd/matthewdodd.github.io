EDWARD MARLOW. I live in Whitecross-street


, opposite Mr. Clark's shop - I saw the prisoner and another boy near his shop, on the 1st of May; the other boy took the bacon, and gave it to the prisoner, who walked away with it in his apron, and the other boy with him - I went up to him, he dropped the bacon and ran off; the officer pursued and took him.

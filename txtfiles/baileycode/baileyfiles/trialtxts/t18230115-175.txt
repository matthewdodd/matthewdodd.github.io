            . The prisoner was in my service; I sent him to Hampstead, and told him to call and borrow my brother's great coat for me; he never came near me all day, so I went to my brother's, and at night met him in Holborn, with half a dozen girls, and asked what he had done with it; he said he had not had, nor seen it. I said, he had had it at half-past eleven o'clock; he said,
"Well, a boy came running after me in Oxford-street, (who I believe to be your brother's boy) and asked me for it." I said my brother had not got a boy.

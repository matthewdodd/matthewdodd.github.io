JOHN LONEY. I am carpenter
 of a ship. On the 2d of November my vessel was lying in the river - I was in the Borough-road


 at seven o'clock that evening, and stopped to see a man taken to the watch-house; I got shoved down twice - it was done designedly - I got up, and walked away - I looked to see what time it was, and my watch was gone; there were a great many people about - I cannot say whether the prisoner was there.

            . I am an officer. On the 2dof November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was turning into Goulston-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner - I asked what he wanted there - he said nothing - I knew he had come from the Borough, and said, "I think you have something to fence," meaning to sell - he said, No - I searched him, and found this watch in his hand, which he had behind him - he said he had found it at first, and afterwards said, "You know very well where I got it: you had better take it, and let me go- it will pay you better;" I took him to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I found it in the Kent-road.

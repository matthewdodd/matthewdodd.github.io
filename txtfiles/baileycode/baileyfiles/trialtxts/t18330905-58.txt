                  PARSONS
               



            . I am a tailor
, and live in the Strand


. On the morning of the 31st of August, I had on my shop counter, a great coat, a frock coat, and a shooting jacket; I had occasion to go into my parlour, which is separated from the shop by a passage; my daughter alarmed me, and I ran into the shop, and turned into Heath-cock-court, by her direction, and saw the two prisoners as close as they could stand together, having my property between them; the skirts of my coats hung down from them; I called, "stop thief," and they threw them down; I told them to stop, and Randall struck me, and I laid hold of him; Wilks ran away; Randall struggled to get away; Mellish the policeman came to my assistance, and I gave him in charge; my daughter picked up the property and took it into the shop; I delivered the great coat to Rice; I have not got the other things; I was to return them that week as they belonged to a customer; the great coat, and frock coat were worth 5l., and more. The shooting jacket was worth 1l., and more.
Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. Are you positive you saw the property in possession of the two prisoners? A. I am; it was between them; I saw the skirts of the great coat hanging down so that it touched both; I cannot say which of them threw it down; they were so close together; I saw it hang down between them; they stood as close together as could be; I never saw Wilks before; I am positive he is the man; I saw Wilks run away when I caught hold of Randall; I went to Bow-street with Randall, and while he was under examination, the magistrate sent for my daughter; and as I returned to Bow-street with my daughter I saw Wilks in Bow-street; he was not in custody then; the first time I saw Wilks after he left the court was in Bow-street; it was a few minutes more than an hour after I saw him in the court; I knew him by his face; they did not separate till Randall struck me; I ran between them in the court, and looked them in the face; when I saw Wilks in the street, I told two officers that he was Randall's companion, and then two men turned him back, and I said, "He is the man;" I did not know then that he was in custody.


                  MARY 
                  ANN PARSONS
               



            . I am daughter of 
               
                  Michael 
                  Parsons
               



            , I am fourteen years old. There is a passage between the back parlour and the shop; I was standing there on the 31st of August, and I saw Wilks come in and take the clothes off the counter; two of them had passed the door before that; that was him and Randall; Randall did not come into the shop; he was passing the door when Wilks took the clothes; after taking the clothes they joined company, and went up Heath-cock-court together, Wilks was carrying the property; Randall would have an opportunity of seeing what Wilks was doing in the shop, when he took the clothes; they joined company between the door and the court, three or four yards from the shop; I gave an alarm and my father came out.
Cross-examined. Q. Are you positive Wilks took the property? A. Yes; I never said Randall took it; Wilks had the property after leaving the shop; I saw him pass the door before, and observed him, because they looked into the shop; they stopped and looked in; I am positive Wilks is the man who entered the shop; I said so, at the office; I swear to Wilks.


                  JOSHUA 
                  MELLISH
               



            , (police-constable N 5). I live in the Kingsland-road. On the morning of the 31st of August, I was in the Strand; I heard an alarm of police; I came up, and Parsons had the prisoner Randall in his custody; I took him from him; I saw Wilks at Bow-street, and asked him what he came for, he said, he came to see a young man who was taken in custody from the Strand; this was about an hour afterwards.
Cross-examined. Q. Was he in custody when you first saw him? A. No, an officer was running after him when I first saw him; he was at Bow-street when I entered; he was taken in custody within a minute after.


                  WILLIAM 
                  RICE
               



            . I am a servant out of place, and live at No. 12, Swallow-street, Piccadilly; I received a great coat from Parsons at Bow-street; I produce it.



                  MICHAEL 
                  PARSONS
               



            . This is the great coat which was taken from my shop.
Wilks's Defence. The fact is the young man who was with the prisoner, came and asked me to go to Bow-street, I said, my coat was wet, he said, "You can put on my great coat if you like," which I did, and when I got to the office to ask about him, they said, I was the same person; I know nothing about it.


                  JOSHUA 
                  MELLISH
               



            . He had a great coat on; when I stopped him - it was a wet morning.


                  MICHAEL 
                  PARSONS
               



            . I lost my coat between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning; within a few minutes of eleven o'clock.
Randall's Defence. I went to Hungerford-market and bought two red herrings for my breakfast, I was passing from Heath-cock-court when Parsons came and took me into custody - I am innocent - I did not get up before half-past ten o'clock that morning.


                  MARY 
                  HEATLEY
               



            . Q. Do you go by the name of Bassett? A. Yes; I live at No. 43, New Peter-street - I left home on the Saturday morning, and went up to a young woman named 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ryan
               



            ; it was a little after nine o'clock when I passed the Abbey; I went to No. 42, Charles-street, Drury-lane - I saw Frederick Wilks standing by the window - during the time I was in the room, Wilks never left the room - a young man came up and told him Randall was taken into custody for a robbery, and asked him to be kind enough to go and see what became of him; he told him to go to Bow-street - Wilks asked him to lend him his great coat, because it rained so - I know the man who brought the message.
COURT. Q. What time will you swear you were at No. 42, Charles-street? A. From ten till about half-past eleven o'clock; I know the time, because I stood talking to a friend of mine in the Strand - the young woman in the room went to see what time it was, to let 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ryan
               



             know the time - I never knew the prisoners before - I only went to see the young woman - Wilks had a brown frock coat on - I did not hear he was in custody till the evening - it was a short, stout man came with the message.
Q. He took off his great coat and sent Wilks to make the inquiry, which he could make by turning round the corner himself? A. Yes.


                  MICHAEL 
                  PARSONS
               



            . At the time Wilks was in the court he had a brown great coat, bound with galloon - I ran between the two prisoners and saw their faces; I am positive of Wilks; I have not a doubt of him, from my knowledge of his face.
Cross-examined. Q. Was it a large Petersham he wore, did it cover his chin? A. No, the coat was loose round him, loose enough to wrap the property under it.
Wilks. The prosecutor says he had a curtain in the shop, if so it was impossible for the girl to see.


                  MICHAEL 
                  PARSONS
               



            . There was no curtain in the shop - as soon as I got to Bow-street I saw this young woman there weeping; she was there at the very moment Wilks was shoved into the office, and she wrung her hands; I can swear to her, I wondered why she cried.
Cross-examined. Q. Was not the office very crowded when you went there? A. This was outside the office - she cried all on a sudden, and burst into tears - I noticed only her and Wilks; they were outside the office.


                  MARY 
                  HEATLEY
               



            . When I was at the young woman's, and Wilks went out, I was wringing wet, and never went out of the place - I was not at Bow-street crying - I was never out of the place till I went home.


                  MICHAEL 
                  PARSONS
               



            . I will swear she is the very person - my daughter saw her too.
Witness. I was never out of the place, till I went out to my own place.


                  JOSHUA 
                  MELLISH
               



            . Wilks had only one coat on; a great coat, and a waistcoat.


                  MARY 
                  ANN
               



             PARSONS. I saw the witness Heatley at Bow-street crying, I am quite certain she is the person.

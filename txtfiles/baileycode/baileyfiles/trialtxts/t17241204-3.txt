William Baker
                  
               



            , of S. Mary Colechurch


, was indicted for 


               privately stealing a Hat, value 10 s. the Goods of 
                     
                        Robert 
                        Pead 
                     



                   ; and a Hat, value 5s. the Goods of 
                     
                        
                           Edward 
                           Vergow 
                        



                      
                  , out of the Shop of the said Robert Pead
            . It appear'd that the Prisoner came into the Shop of the Prosecutor, (an Apothecary
) and ask'd for a Halfpennyworth of Spanish Liquorish. Vergow, the Prosecutor's Servant, who was in the Back-Shop, came out and told him, they did not use to sell such small Quantities; with which Answer the Prisoner went away, and Vergow immediately missing his Master's Hat, and his own, (both which before hung on the Pegs in the Shop) he pursued the Prisoner. His Master's Hat, with four more, he found in a Basket which the Prisoner had on his Shoulder, and his own Hat under the Prisoner's great Coat. The Prisoner, to excuse himself, said, that he had bought the Hats but just before, and call'd 
               
                  John 
                  Baker 
               



             to his Reputation, who deposed, that he was a Gardener
 at the Old Rose in Marybone, had known the Prisoner 20 Years, and had often employ'd him in his Business, but never knew him guilty of any Dishonesty. But the Fact being plainly proved upon the Prisoner, and his Defence being frivolous, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4s. 10d.

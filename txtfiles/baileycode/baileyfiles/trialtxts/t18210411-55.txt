            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, on the 23d of February, I went to Mr. Capel's in Russell-square


, and saw the prisoner. I called him aside into the pantry with me - I said I had come on very unpleasant business, and asked him if he had any of his master's property - He said he had nothing. I searched, and found in a cupboard over where he slept, a box containing twelve bottles of wine, each had a napkin round it. I afterwards found ten more, in all twenty-two bottles - and two of brandy, and some tea. Mr. Capel asked how he could do such a thing - he said he was very sorry for it. I searched here and found two bunches of keys.

            , ESQ. I heard the prisoner say he was sorry for what he had done, and it was his first offence - he was my butler
, and entrusted with all my plate, and to pay all my bills - he did it faithfully - he lived two years and a quarter with me. The napkins were what he had the care of.

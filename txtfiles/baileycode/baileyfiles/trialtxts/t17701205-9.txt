            . I live with Mr. Sampson. I had packed up these pieces of stained paper mentioned in the indictment, to go to Portsmouth; 
               
                  John
                   Orton
               



             brought the prisoner and this paper into Mr. Sampson's house: [producing it] I can sware it is Messrs. William and 
               
                  Richard
                   Sampson
               



            's property.

            . On the 23d of November, I was going up Lombard-Street, I saw the prisoner come out of Messrs. Sampson's with the paper; I suspected him, and stopt him; he struggled and cried, and wanted to get away. He said he was going to carry it to Duke's-place. I rung Messrs. Sampson's bell, the last witness came to the door, I shewed him the paper; he said it was Messrs. Sampson's property. The prisoner, in his defence, said he was employed by a man to carry it to Duke's-place.

MR. CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution.
EDWIN HILLS. I am one of the wardens of St. Philip's Chapel
, which is a chapel of ease, within the district of St. Mark, in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell. St. Mark is a district marked out for ecclesiastical purposes - it is a chapel in which divine service is performed according to the rites of the Church of England - in consequence of information which I received, I, in company with Mr. Milne, examined some property which was found by the officers - I examined the chapel on the morning on which the robbery had been committed overnight - I examined the window over the vestry-room; part of it was out; sufficient had been removed to admit the person of a man - I went into the chapel, which had been furnished with gas fittings - I missed some gas burners, and a great quantity of the gas fittings, brass fittings, and burners; and some gas lamps were removed, and the oil lamps of the reading desk and pulpit - the gas burners, lamps, and fittings had been fixed to the chapel - the altar cloth was gone - I did not examine respecting the wine - there was a box in the vestry-room secured by a lock, and I subsequently missed that lock - some Bibles and Prayer Books were taken belonging to the parishioners - the gas fittings, burners, alter cloth, and looking-glass, have since been shown to me by the officers - they are articles some of which were affixed to the chapel, and others which were there; in my opinion they are the same as I had seen in the chapel - I had seen them I think on the Sunday previous to the robbery; there was nothing missing then, that I am aware of; the furniture was complete to my knowledge then.
COURT. Q. Do you recollect what day you missed the things? A. I cannot charge my memory with it.


                  JOHN 
                  WILLIAM HIGGINS
               



            . I lived at No. 3, St. John's-street, on the 6th of March, but do not now. On the morning of the 5th of March, about half-past six o'clock, I was coming along by the corner of Jerusalem-passage to go to where I worked, at the Northumberland Arms, Clerkenwell-green - Jerusalem-passage is in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, about a quarter of a mile from St. Philip's Chapel - I saw eight or nine men conversing together at the corner of Aylesbury-street, and Jerusalem-passage, standing at the public-house at the corner - four of them had bundles, and one had a large copper - I saw the prisoner Richardson among them - I noticed him more distinctly than the rest, because he turned round - he had a bag on his shoulder, closed up at the neck - I could not observe what was in it, but as he jerked it on his shoulder it jumbled together, and I thought it was candlesticks, brass work - I did not see any of it - they went in a direction from St. Philip's Chapel towards Golden-lane - as Richardson passed by me, he said to me, "Halloo, cad, we have got a swag now, and if you like, you can come it on us, but what - you must expect afterwards."
Q. Did you notice the person of any of the others? A. From the size and dress of James Coster - I could not properly swear to him, but a person of his size and dress was among them - when they went along, one of them hallooed out, "We are going to Fatty's, in Golden-lane" - Elmer went by the name of Fatty - I knew him before, and knew who they meant - some of them went on one side of the way, and some on the other - I watched them across St. John-square, and saw them proceeding from Albemarle-street, which is in a direction towards Golden-lane - I immediately ran up to the station-house, in Spa-fields, and informed them of what I had seen - Pryor and three other policemen accompanied me - I went with them to Golden-lane, and after stopping a few minutes at the corner of Play-house-yard, where Elmer lived, Richardson came along, and was about turning up the yard, but seeing the policeman standing there, he immediately walked along straight - he had then the same bag with him as he had before - I pointed him out to the police, and then proceeded to my work.
Prisoner Richardson. I want to know how he knew I had the same things in Golden-lane, as I had in Aylesbury-street? Witness. It was a bag like the other, and the bundle was the same size, and he carried it in the same position.
COURT. Q. Had he both a bag and a bundle? A. No; I consider the bag was the bundle - it was a bag - I cannot swear to anybody but Richardson - it was half-past six o'clock in the morning when I met them - it was light at the time - it is a public street, and a great throughfare - but there was nobody passing much at the time - it is a very great thoroughfare in the daytime.


                  THOMAS 
                  SHADDICK
               



             (police-constable G 97). On the morning of the 5th of March, I was at the Rosoman-street station-house, Spa-fields, about a quarter to seven o'clock- Higgins came there and gave information - in consequence of which I and other policemen accompanied him to Golden-lane - Playhouse-yard leads into Golden-lane - Elmer's shop is No. 16, Playhouse-yard, the second house from Golden-lane - when I got into Golden-lane, I saw Richardson - Higgins pointed him out to me - he had a bundle on his left shoulder, and was going towards Barbican - Higgins observed him first and pointed him out - I overtook him - he was by himself at that time - I asked him what he had there in the bag - he said he had some old brass - I asked where he brought it from - he said from No. 16, Islington-green- I asked him who from there - he said from his father - I asked him if his father was anything in the brass line - he said he was, and that he was carrying it to Whitechapel, to sell it - I asked if he was in the line himself - he said he was either a brass finisher or polisher - I cannot recollect which - 
               
                  William 
                  Cuthbert
               



            , who was with me, took the bag from his shoulder, examined it, and found it was gas fittings almost new - he had before said it was old brass work - I produce what was found in the bag - Cuthbert said they were almost new, and were gas work - the prisoner made no reply - I took him to the station-house in Bunhill-row - there were fifty-three pieces of tubes and fittings all together, and there was one box lock in the bag, party made of brass and partly of iron - I searched Richardson's person, and found a book in his coat pocket, with the name of Charles Thacker printed on it, and one piece of gas fitting, and one knife with "Hatton, carver," on it - the piece of gas fitting is a brass rim.
WILLIAM CUTHBERT. I am a policeman - I was at the station-house, in Rosoman-street, on the morning of the 6th of March, when Higgins came - I accompanied Shaddick and other officer to Golden-lane - I produce a box lock, which was taken from the bag Richardson had.


                  SAMUEL 
                  HATTON
               



            . I was taken into custody on this charge, on the 6th of March, the day after the robbery, in consequence of a knife being found - I was discharged the same night, and next morning I saw the prisoner Thacker by Bounds', in Ray-street, near Clerkenwell-green - I think it was between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - he said he had had a rare blow out of wine - I asked him where he got it from - he said that was his business - I asked him again, and he said he got it down the road - I asked him where about there - he said, "At the church, in the field, to be sure" - he said down the road, by which I understood Bagnigge-wells-road - I asked him how he got into the church; he said that was his business - I asked him again, and he said he got in at the window, where the piece had been cut out - I asked him what he cut it out with; he said, with a knife which he bought of me - he had bought this knife of me (looking at it) - it has the name of"Hatton, carver," on it - I am a carver by business - he then began telling me about the wine, that he got some wine, and got into the pulpit, and had a rare game.
Q. Did he say he was alone, or in company? A. He said, "We had a load of wine, and had a rare game in the pulpit" - I know where Elmer lives now - he goes by the name of Old Fatty, and lives the second door out of Golden-lane, on the right hand side as you go up - he keeps a marine-store shop - I asked Thacker what he got at the church - he said they got some brass and books, and things at the chapel, and that they had taken them down to Old Fatty's.
Prisoner Thacker. I wish to ask whether he has ever been in custody on any other charge? Witness. Yes, I have been taken up, but never but what I have been innocent - I have been taken up twice, but not more - the third time was about the knife - one charge was about some boxes whichhad been stolen, and the other about a ham - I do not know that that had been stolen, but I was taken up for it - I have left my father twice - I have always had sufficient money when I went away from home - I had saved it up from what my father allows me - the last time I left my father was about three months ago - I think it was on the 8th or 9th of last months, when I sold him the knife.
Richardson. He said at Hatton-garden, three weeks ago, that it was five weeks before. Witness. I sold it to him in Holborn - it was down a turning in Holborn - I forget the name of the street - it is where they sell boots and shoes, and things.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have been in custody twice, were you an acquaintance of Thacker? A. No - I have often spoken to him - I have not known him a great while - I knew him before I was in custody.


                  BENJAMIN 
                  PRYOR
               



             (policeman, G 226). On the 6th of March I took the witness, Samuel Hatton, into custody - he was taken to the office and afterwards discharged - on the 11th of March I was passing by where he lives, which is on my beat - I went into his house in Ray-street, at eleven o'clock at night - I was then in possession of the knife produced, and offered the knife to Hatton - he said it was not his - he gave me an account of what he had done with it - I had some conversation with him, and in consequence of that conversation I apprehended Thacker the following day, the 12th, at No. 1, Coppice-row, close by, at 10 o'clock in the morning - he was in bed - I told him I took him concerning robbing the church; and before he said anything to me, I told him the property had been found in Playhouse-yard - he said, "D-n that Old Fatty, if it had not been for him I should not have got into this" - I then took him to the station-house, and as we went along, in Bowling-green-lane, I said to him, "There was a note found in the church, do you know anything of it?" - he said,"I did not write it" - I said, "You cannot write, can you?" - he said, "I can write enough for that" - he said,"The old rascal has not paid us for it yet" - I said, "What, have you been down, since you carried the things down?" - he said, "Me and Dick have been down once." - On the morning of the robbery of the 5th of March, I was on Clerkenwell-green myself, about eight o'clock - I saw Thacker there drunk, and when I was in the yard, at Hatton-garden office, I told him I had seen him on Clerkenwell-green on the morning of the robbery, and said, "I did not know at that time that you had been doing what you have done," and told him he was drunk at the time - he said, "I know I was rather fresh by drinking too much wine at the church" - I accompanied the officers on the 12th of March to search the premises of Elmer - he was at home in his shop - he said he had been searched before, and he thought we were giving him a good deal of trouble - I had searched the house on the Wednesday previous, and found nothing - Findlay, Busain, and others, were with me on the 12th- Findlay said something to him - I cannot be positive what it was - Elmer expressed himself quite willing to be searched, and only complained of the number of men that came - we searched about the house for a long time without effect - at last we went into the cellar, which is enclosed from the street by a wall, which passes between the grating outside, and the shop window - the inside of the wall forms part of the enclosure of the cellar itself - I sounded the cellar walls with an iron rod, and when I came to the part between the grating and the shop window, it sounded hollow - I commenced opening the wall in front, it had been recently compoed over inside - I began to break the compo away - Findlay told me not to do so, but to look at the top - we looked at the top and found a quantity of dirt, which struck my attention - I pulled the dirt off the top, and found a lid, and there was a box or bin made with boards in the wall - we opened the lid, and there found the property which I produce, a looking-glass, altar-cloth, four Prayer Books, thermometer, Bibles, four oil lamps, two candlesticks, some ornamental brass work, and two bottles full of what appears to be wine - Elmer was in the cellar when we searched there, and went away directly we found these things - as soon as we found out this secret-place he went away directly.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I think you said he made no objection to your searching the place? A. None at all - he offered every facility - he desired his wife to bring down some instrument for the purpose of examining various places - he did not make any objection to my searching - he helped us going about the various places.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the instrument he sent for? A. The iron rod, which I sounded the wall with- he did not point out the secret place in the wall - on our finding it out he went away.
Thacker. He says it was ten o'clock when he took me in bed - I wish to know whether it was sooner or later. -
Witness. It was as near ten as possible - it did not strike a quarter after nine as we went up Bowling-green-lane - I was at breakfast at nine o'clock at home.


                  JOHN 
                  BUSAIN
               



             (policeman). I went with the other officers to the house in Golden-lane, on Wednesday, the 12th of March - it is a marine-store shop - I saw Elmer in the shop when I went there - I went in, in company with Findlay - Elmer asked what we came there for - Findlay replied that he had come again about the church property, that he (Findlay) had been thereabout before last week - I told him I had every reason to believe it was then in his possesion - he most strenuously denied all knowledge of it- he said he knew nothing whatever of it - he had not got it - it was not in his house - I asked him, not having a search warrant, if he would allow me the privilege of going over his premises to see if I could find it - he granted me permission - we searched the house and premises - I and Pryor and Findlay - we went into the cellar - we examined the floor of the cellar first, and while we were examining the floor Elmer stood very quiet, but his wife appeared very uneasy - after examining the floor, Pryor and Findlay were knocking against the wall - Elmer remained in the cellar until a part in the wall sounded hollow, and I directed the dirt to be removed, saying I was confident the property was there - when I opened the bin, and the property produced was found, I turned round to secure Elmer, and found he was gone - I ran up stairs and directed Hull to go after him - he took him in the street, and brought him back into the shop - these articles produced are what we found in the bin, which was part of the wall covered over with a lid, and then covered with dirt - it is like a locker on board a vessel - it opened at the top like alocker - I have a list of the things found - there was an altar-cloth, thermometer, looking-glass, five Prayer Books, two Bibles, four oil lamps, two brass candlesticks, twelve other pieces of brass, an inkstand, towel, and two bottles, which I believe contained Tent wine - after Elmer was brought back, I proceeded with him to the station-house and when I got to the station-house, he said, the things were brought to him by two men - I neither threatened nor made him any promise - on my opening the things, he said voluntarily at the station-house, that the things had been brought to his house by two men, that he had not bought them, and that he had never seen so much of them before as he saw then at the station-house - among other things, found at his house, I found an account-book - I have it here - I asked him if it was his account-book - he said it was - it contains accounts of things purchased by him - I have had it ever since - I have examined it, and it contains no account of these lamps, and the articles I found in the wall.
Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. He told you he had not bought them, and had not seen so much of them as he did then? A. Yes; there are divers entries of things bought - he furnished every facility for searching the house, and remained with us till we discovered the bin - I have had the property in my custody ever since.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the place in the wall a very easy place to discover? A. It was a very difficult place to discover - it was the last place I should have thought of examining - the iron instrument was fetched to try the floor - it was a common pricker used to try the ground.


                  GEORGE 
                  FINDLAY
               



            . I was present at the station-house in Rosoman-street, on the 5th of March, when Higgins gave information, and was present at the search at Elmer's on the 12th of March - on the morning of the 5th of March, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to St. Philip's Chapel, and found it had been broken into by removing a window at the communion above the vestry - I went in at that window myself - I went into the vestry-room, and found a small deal box, in which the sacramental wine is kept - the lock was gone from it; this brass and iron lock,(produced by Cuthbert,) belongs to that box - it fits it - the upper part, where the hasp would be, was wrenched off, and the hasp is now in the lock - the box had been wrenched open, and the hasp given away - a paper was produced at the office, which was found on the communion-table, and which has been sealed up at the office.


                  THOMAS 
                  STILWELL
               



            . I have examined the gas fittings produced - I am beadle of St. Philip's Chapel - the minister of the chapel is the Rev. Thomas Watson - these gas fittings are part of the fittings belonging to the chapel; and the four oil lamps are part of the porperty taken from the chapel - the altar-cloth also, and the looking-glass, thermometer, and two candlesticks - the thermometer and candlesticks are the property of Mr. John Lee, who attends St. Philip's and St. Mark's - he is a servant to both churches - a Bible and three Prayer Books belong to Mr. James Lane - two Bibles and three Prayer Books belong to Mr. Thomas Jarman - there were eight half-pint bottles of Sherry wine missing from the box, and six bottles of Tent were taken from the vestry cupboard - this wine is the same as we have for the sacrament: it is Tent wine - on the evening before the robbery, at twenty minutes before eight o'clock, (Tuesday evening, the 4th of March,) I had myself secured the chapel - the gas fittings, oil lamps, and things were safely fixed there then - on the following morning I accompanied Findlay and the officers, and found them gone - this lock belongs to the box, and has been wrenched off.
COURT. Q. Put your hand on any one article, and tell us if you can swear to it positively? A. This candlestick I know by having no screw at the bottom - I know this to be either the reading desk or pulpit lamp - I can swear to it by the worm inside - I have examined all the fittings: they correspond with the works in the chapel - I believe them all to be what were taken away - they appear to fit the place from which they have been taken.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take them there to try them? A. We took part of them to try.
JOHN HULL. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 12th of March, I accompanied the other officers to examine Elmer's house - in consequence of directions from Pryor, I went in pursuit of Elmer - I found him in Golden-lane - he had got two or three hundred yards; and at the station-house he stated that if it had not been for hiding these things away, it would have been all right - I had said nothing to him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not say who hid them? A. No; nor that he knew of their being hid.
Thacker's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand before you in a very awful situation; not having the power to procure legal assistance, which if I had, no doubt the evidence might have been rendered of no avail. Hatton has been several times in custody, and was taken for this charge, by reason of a knife being found with his name on it, which he says he sold to me. Now it must appear to you, how easy it will be for him to say he sold the knife to me, to exculpate himself. With regard to the evidence of Pryor - he took me in custody in bed; he showed me the knife; and I said I knew nothing of it, which I did not. In going to the station-house, he said,"Charles, I have known you and your father some time: this is a capital charge; it will be either life or death for you: if you will tell all you know, I give you my word as a man, all shall be right." And I said, "I know nothing of the robbery." As to the book found on Richardson, I own the book is mine; I lent it him two or three months ago, and that was the last time I saw him, till I saw him in custody. I hope you will take my case into your consideration. I wish to submit to the Jury how unlikely it is, if I was concerned in the robbery, I should have trusted myself in the hands of Hatton, by stating to him what he states.
Elmer's Defence. I am totally innocent of purchasing the articles, they were brought to my shop by two men - I never bought them nor agreed to buy them. When I heard there was a noise about the things, I certainly concealed them away.

8th of Aug, 27 handkerchiefs, value 4l. the goods of

SAMUEL SUCKLET BENSON
. I live with Richard Wilcox Fairlaw, a pawn-broker, in Lisson-grove. On the 8th of August, at nine o'clock, the prisoner came and unfastened the window, took the twenty-seven hankerchiefs from it, and went out with them—I was at the back of the shop—he looked round, saw me, and ran away with them—I pursued—just before I overtook him, two policemen stopped him, and took the handkerchiefs from him.





JOSEPH MOUNT
 (police-sergeant C 6.) I produce a certificate of the pri-soner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM DOAL
 was indicted

for stealing 2 pairs of drawers, value 4d.; 2 shirts, 4d.; 2 pairs of stockings, 2d.; 1 towel, 1d.; 1 apron, 1d.; and 1 bag, 1d.; the goods of 



James Wimble; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HANNAH WIMBLE
. I am the wife of William Wimble; we live at Beimondsey. I left these drawers, shirts, and other things in my yard to dry, on the 11th of June—I missed them the next morning—I have examined these—they are my son James's—he is twenty-two years old.





HANNAH STEELE
. I am the wife of William Steele; we live in Elephant-lane, Rotherhithe. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning, on the 12th of June, the prisoner knocked at my door—he asked me to buy somethings—I did not like to buy them, and he asked me to allow

him to leave them till the other shops were open, which he did—I am sure it was the prisoner—I informed the policeman, and gave him the things.





WILLIAM HUMPHREYS
 (policeman.) Mrs. Steele came to the station—I went with her, and waited—the prisoner came about nine o'clock—Steele said to him, "You have got me into a deal of trouble"—I went out, and said to him, "Where did you get these things?"—he said, "I picked them up."





WILLIAM NOAKES
 (police-constable M 104.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court, by the name of 


William Walkinshaw—(read—Convicted 4th March, 1844, and confined one year)—I know the prisoner to be the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

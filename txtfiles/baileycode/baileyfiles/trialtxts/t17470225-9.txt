Q. What did you do with the Tea?

Prisoner. I had not been from Sea above a Fortnight. I was left sick on Shore, I could not get any Ship at Plymouth; I went down to this Rag fair, I went to buy a Pair of Breeches, and as I was going by this House, I saw two or three Lads a drinking, and I called for a Dram; I saw that Lad,

            , come in with a Bundle upon his Head; I had not been there above three or four Minutes, before the Gentlemen came in; I did not attempt to run away.
Q. to Holloway. What did you do with the other Stockings and Tea?
Holloway. We left all the Stockings in the House, but the Constable took but Six.
Hollingsworth, Constable. They were tumbled among the Bed-clothes, the Headborough did say they were loosely tied up, and he felt some of them about his Legs; the Linen was so numerous in Bits, that we weighed them in Scales, and I think there were nine Pounds, and the Stockings were six Pair; what became of the other I don't know.
Q. to Holloway. What had the other twelve People to do with you?
Holloway. Please ye, my Lord, there were two Buyers there, and another that use to carry off the Goods when they were bought; they were cleared here on Wednesdays, on Account of the Buckles, the Stockings, as soon as we had looked them over, one of the Prisoners gave them to a Woman, and she put them somewhere, but I can't tell where.

            . I am a watchman, I was going my rounds at one o'clock, I saw the prisoner Williams coming with the sail under his arm, and another man along with him, he went into Mrs. Conner's house, a lodging house in Wells street, they both went in and up two pair of stairs; my partner was at one end of the street, and I at the other; I call'd to him, before he could get up they had thrown the sail out at the window. Williams jumped out of a two pair of stairs window, and made his escape ; the other made no resistance.
Jos. Ray. The sail belongs to the boat that I row in. I am in his Majesty's service.
Jos. Owen. The person who made the sail deposed it was a sail belonging to his Majesty, and that Mr. Searle is to maintain them as he before deposed.

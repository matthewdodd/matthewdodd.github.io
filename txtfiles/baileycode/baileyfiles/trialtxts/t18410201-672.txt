JOHN SADLER
. I am a carpenter. I was at work for Mr. Bonnin in an empty house at Pelham-crescent, Brompton—on the 24th of December I locked up the house, and left this cramp there—I went there again on Monday morning, the 28th—the house was then broken open, and the cramp gone, which was Mr. Bonnin's—I am sure it was locked up safe when I closed the house.





ABRAHAM HUNT

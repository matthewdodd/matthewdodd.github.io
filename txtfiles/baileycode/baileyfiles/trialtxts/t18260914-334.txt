            . I was in Holborn


 on the 11th of September, near Mr. Davies' shop; I saw the prisoner go and take the cotton off the rail, and put it into her lap - she went a little way into the shop, then came out and went down Chancery-lane; I went and told the shopman, who pursued, and stopped her - I saw the cotton fall from her in Holborn.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Davies. I pursued the prisoner and found this cotton in her apron - she said "Be off, you don't want me;" she let it fall out of her apron - it has our shop mark on it.

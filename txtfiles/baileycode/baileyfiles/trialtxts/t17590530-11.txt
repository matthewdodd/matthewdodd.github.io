             a second time, 
               
                  Mary, wife

            , and

                     John

            , April 27
.* 
John Imeson. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             came to wash for me, and she brought 
               
                  Martha 
                  Jones 
               



             with her to help her forwards, in the morning before the family was up. And when 
               
                  Ann 
                  Saunders 
               



             made her confession, she said, she gave them the things. I went with others, and search'd on the 27th of April last, and found five pair of shoes in 
               
                  Martha 
                  Jones 
               



            's apartment, and a pewter plate, an old brass candlestick, and a pair of ruffles. She was a lodger to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



            . And we found two pair of shoes in 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



            's apartment.

Q. What account did Jones give of herself?
Imeson. She said 
               
                  Ann 
                  Saunders 
               



             perswaded her to take the things. The goods produc'd in court and depos'd to.


                  John 
                  Twycross 
               



            . I was at the taking up of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             and 
               
                  Martha 
                  Jones 
               



            . We search'd, and found five pair of shoes, a pewter plate, a brass candlestick, and a pair of ruffles, in the apartment of Jones. She said 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             and the maid gave them to her, to bring home. And Paul said, the maid gave them to her to give to Jones, for Jones to carry home.


                  John 
                  Furnish 
               



            . After the maid was taken up, she confessed, in my hearing, that she had given these things to the two other prisoners, but could not tell how many pair of shoes she had given them.


                  Joshua 
                  Perkins 
               



            . After Saunders the servant-maid was taken up, she own'd the whole affair. We went and took up the other two prisoners; and in Jones's apartment we found five pair of shoes, a brass candlestick, a pewter plate, and a pair of ruffles; and in Paul's apartment we found two pair of shoes; and she own'd, she had had a third pair, which she had given away. I ask'd them how they could serve their master so, they said, the D - l was in them. I ask'd the maid, how she could give her master's goods away so? her answer was, Easy got, easy gone.
Mr Cheltenham. I saw the shoes after they were found.
Saunders's Defence.
They perswaded me to take the things away.
Jones's Defence.
I never ask'd her for any thing in my life; nor had I any conversation with her. She was a stranger to me.
Paul's Defence.


                  Ann 
                  Saunders 
               



             over perswaded me to take the things; and told me, I should come into no danger.
For Jones.


                  Thomas 
                  Hunt 
               



            . The prisoner Jones work'd for me about a year and half.
Q. What is your business?
Hunt. I am a thread-throwster; she doubled for me; I was very much surpriz'd, when I heard she was taken up for such a fact as this. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             work'd for me likewise; she said to me, she was very sorry she had brought Jones into this scrape. Jones behaved herself very honestly to me, and was she out of trouble I would employ her again, having some confidence in her honesty.


                  Julian 
                  James 
               



            . I have always look'd upon Jones to be very honest; she has dealt with me ever since she work'd for Mr. Hunt; I believe she was drawn into it by Paul.


                  Sarah 
                  Flavel 
               



            . Paul and Jones are two honest creatures.


                  Mary 
                  Eginton 
               



            . Jones lodg'd with me some time; I trusted her in my house; I never knew her to wrong any body of the point of a pin.


                  Samuel 
                  Gosling 
               



            . I did keep a publick house some time ago; Jones us'd to come to my house; she behaved herself very sober, and very honest; I never saw any harm by her.
All three 

               Guilty
            .

John Smith. I keep a Publick-house
: On the 7th of September, about one or two in the Morning, my Cellar was broke open, and I lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment: The Prisoner was taken with them upon him, and before the Justice he said, he found them among the Trees at Covent-Garden.

            . I took the Prisoner that Night, on Suspicion of stealing these Things: I asked him how he came by them, and he said, he found them, and was going about his Master's Business; but he would not tell who his Master was, and at my Peril I might touch him.

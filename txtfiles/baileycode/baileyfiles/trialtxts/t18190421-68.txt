                  MAYO
               



            . I am guard to the old Prince of Wales Birmingham coach, which goes from the George and Blue Boar, Holborn. On the 4th of April, the prisoner, 
               
                  William 
                  Taverner
               



            , went inside - he has lost a leg, which made me notice him - he took his place for Stratford upon Avon. When he got into the coach, he said he was going to Beerley-cross, which is a public-house four miles and a half from Stratford - I put him down there on the 5th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; 
               
                  William 
                  Kitchener
               



            , a blind man, and his wife keep the house.I went on to Birmingham, which is seventeen miles and a half further. I returned the same evening, and reached Beerley-cross between eight and nine o'clock. Mrs. Kitchener called out, and said she had a passenger and parcel for me. 
               
                  William 
                  Taverner
               



             got in, and wished the people good night. The landlady gave me a frail-basket, which I put into the coach. The boy gave me 2 d., and told me to be sure and get it booked at the first place I came to, which I did at Stratford upon Avon - I saw the name of Ward on it. We arrived at the White Horse cellar about half-past seven o'clock on Tuesday, the 6th of April, and put Taverner down there - the coach and parcel went on to the Blue Boar; I then saw the parcels were all right according to the weigh-bill. I delivered the parcel with the rest to the book-keeper. I took particular notice of it, as I had a suspicion about it. I afterwards pointed it out to Iles, the porter. It was directed to Mrs. Ward, in Clerkenwell - I do not recollect the street.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The woman of the house gave me the parcel. My suspicions arose from the place it came from, and I told Iles to take notice where he went to.

                  ILES
               



            . I am a porter at the George and Blue Boar - I deliver the parcels. On the 6th of April I assisted in unloading the coach. The guard directed my attention to a basket, directed to Mrs. Ward, No. 41, Compton-street, St. John-street, Clerkenwell - it was fastened with strings. In consequence of what Mayo said to me, I was induced to undo one corner of it. I got one hand in, and felt something like a fowl with feathers on - on putting my hand a little further, I felt a paper parcel; I then undid it a little more, pulled the parcel out, and opened it - it was folded up. It contained bank notes. One bundle contained five notes not tied up; what the other contained I do not know - this was at the 
               
                  Robin 
                  Hood
               



            , public-house, in Holborn. I immediately told the landlord, and showed it to him - I then took it to Mr. C. Ibbertson, who was my master, gave him the basket we had undone there, and found six rolls of notes tied up in one parcel. Mr. Ibberson, another gentleman, and myself, then went to the Bank, and left the basket locked up in Mr. Ibbertson's private office. Sometime after, Mr. Ibbertson called me, and told me to pack the basket up as before, which I did in his presence, and put the notes in again. I went with my cart as usual - Foy and Mr. Milton followed me to Compton-street. I stopped short of the door, and was pulling the basket out of the cart - I had not time to knock at the door, before the female prisoner came out, putting a smile on her countenance. I went up to her with the basket under my arm, and said,
"Mrs. Ward, is this right?" and looking at the direction -
"Yes," she said,
"my name is Ward." I said,
"I have a basket for you, which comes to 2 s. 2 d." She gave me 2 s. 6 d., and said,
"Give me 4 d." I had given her the basket. I said I had no halfpence - she said,
"Never mind the halfpence, keep them." I said,
"Good woman, I don't want them," and gave her the 6 d. back, upon which she turned her head towards the door, and said,
"William, have you any halfpence?" a man's voice said,
"No, I have not." She put her hand into her own pocket, and gave me 2 1/2 d. I took it, and went away. Before I left the door, Foy came up and went in. It is a private house.
Cross-examined. by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you authorized to open parcels - A. No. I did not tell my master or the book-keeper that I meant to open it. I told the landlord of the 
               
                  Robin 
                  Hood
               



            . I have been four years in my place.
Q. I suppose you did not put the paper parcel there yourself - A. No. The 
               
                  Robin 
                  Hood
               



             is about ten doors from our inn.
MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Had the guard told you of any suspicious he had - A. Yes, and I told the landlord of the public-house before I opened it. I had delivered a parcel at that house on the 27th of March, addressed to William Taverner, in his own name - I delivered it to him. When I found this parcel directed to the same place it created my suspicion.
WILLIAM SELL. I keep the 
               
                  Robin 
                  Hood
               



            , public-house, in Holborn. On the 6th of April Iles came to my house with a basket - I knew he was porter at the George and Blue Boar. He communicated his suspicions about the basket, and said he should like to satisfy his curiosity, for the guard had told him there was something wrong in it. He went into the back-room - I was busy at the time. In five or six minutes he called me. There were five or six parcels of bank notes, and one loose parcel, which contained 5 l. notes - the others were tied up. I said,
"Put them into the basket, and go and tell your master," which he immediately did.
Cross-examined by MR. LOVETT. He said he should like to go in with me and open it.
CHRISTAIN IBBERTSON, JUN. I am book-keeper at the George and Blue Boar. On the 6th of April Mayo called my attention to a basket directed to Mrs. Ward, Compton-street, Clerkenwell - it came by the Birmingham coach, and was put ready for Iles to deliver.
CHRISTAIN IBBERTSON. I keep the George and Blue Boar Inn. On the 6th of April Iles brought me a basket, it contained a couple of fowls, and some rolls of bank notes. I locked part of them up, and took the rest to the Bank. They were replaced, and the basket sewed up - Iles was to deliver it. He has been five or six years in our service.


                  JOHN 
                  FOY
               



            . I am an officer. On the 6th of April I had direction, went to the George and Blue Boar, and saw the basket, it was sewed up. Iles took it, I followed, and saw him stop rather short of the house, and deliver it to a person. As he was leaving the door I went up, and saw the female prisoner in the passage with the basket under her arm - Milton followed me into the passage. I said,
"What have you got there, Mrs. Taverner?" she made no answer, but went into the parlour, and threw the basket on the floor - the male prisoner was there. I asked her what it contained? she said she did not know. I asked her where it came from, and who it belonged to? she said she did not know. I asked her what she paid for it? she said 2 s. 3 d. she believed. I said,
"You would not have paid for it unless you knew who it belonged to, I should think." She said an acquaintance of her's called on her about a fortnight before, to request she might have a parcel directed there for her, and her name was Ward. I asked her where she was to be found, and where she lived? she said she did not know. I asked her when the person was to call for it? she said she did not know - perhaps tomorrow. I cut it open, and showed them the contents -they denied all knowledge of it; the male prisoner was sitting at the table. The basket contained 496 1 l. and 19 5 l. notes - (examines them) - these are them; I marked them all before I parted with them. When I was up stairs, I asked the woman if she had any lodgers? she said she had a young woman and her father, of the name of Card. I asked her if she had any lodger of the name of Ward? she said she had not, nor never had. I said it was very strange she could give no account of Mrs. Ward - she said she never saw her in her life. Mr. Milton said,
"How is that? why you said she was an acquaintance, and called on you a fortnight ago." She said,
"I never saw her in my life." He said,
"How did she procure leave to have the parcel directed here?" she said she received a letter from her about a week ago, asking permission, but she had destroyed the letter.
Cross-examined by MR. LOVETT. Q. Where did you first give your evidence - A. At the Office. I made a deposition, which was read over at the time in the presence of the prisoners and their Counsel - I said it was true.
MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were you examined in the usual manner before the magistrate - A. Yes.

            . I am an inspector at the Bank. I went to Mr. Ibbertson, and saw the basket and its contents. I followed the cart with Foy, who has given a correct account of the transaction.

                  Taverner
               



             said,
"That the person desired her to let the parcel be left; that she did not know who he was, or where he lived." (I had asked her where he lived, supposing it to be a man, and she adopted my conclusion of its being a man.)

            . I live in Bow-lane, and am the proprietor of the house, No. 41, Compton-street. The prisoners came to live there between Midsummer and Michaelmas last. I received the rent from 
               
                  William

            . I am an inspector of bank notes. The whole of the notes are forged in every respect. The 5 l. notes are signed Draper, but they are not his signature. All the 1 l. notes are off the same plate.

             rented the house, and had a friend named Ward, who, about the latter end of March, leaving town, and having been in habits of the closest friendship with her, applied to her to have the parcel left with her. The prisoner, 
               
                  William 
                  Taverner

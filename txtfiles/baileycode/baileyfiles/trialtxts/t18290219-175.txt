            . I live in Bishopsgate-street


, and am a draper
. This print was in my shop, just within the door, on the 19th of February, just at dark - I did not see it taken.

            . I was in Bishopsgate-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned, and saw the prisoner running, with this print on his arm; a lad was running after him - I pursued, and he dropped the print in the road; I never lost sight of him till I stopped him, in Norton-falgate.

            . I was standing in the prosecutor's shop, and saw somebody pull the print from the door; I ran out, and saw a man running with it - he dropped it; I took it up, and took it back to the shop: I did not observe his person - he ran towards Norton-falgate.

            . I am an officer. I was standing by my own door - the prisoner came by, and I saw him taken by Youlden; I asked how he came to take the print - he said he had done no such thing, and begged of me to let him go.(Property produced and sworn to.)

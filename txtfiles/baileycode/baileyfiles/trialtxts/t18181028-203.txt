 with a basket of clothes on my shoulder-the prisoner came behind me, and I felt something at my pocket. A lady said the prisoner had picked my pocket - I pursued, and seized him - He tried to throw the handkerchief down the area, but it lodged on the rails-two others were with him. (Property produced and sworn to.)

                  EDWARD 
                  NEWMAN
               



            . I am a rope-maker
, and live at Deptford. On the morning of the 16th of December I went to my warehouse fronting Deptford-creek



; and found the premises were broken open in two parts - I missed rope and twine to the value of nearly 60l.; I remember, on the 11th of December, three men came to my warehouse, and I have not the least doubt that Hook was one of them - they came to sell some old rope, and two of them went to the window, where it is unusual for such men to go; it struck me that they took more than usual notice of the premises - they were looking about a particular window, which was one that was broken open.
COURT. Q.Was the cord and twine in a state in which it could be sold? A.Part of it was.


                  JAMES 
                  VALLOR
               



            . I am foreman to Mr. Newman. On the 16th of December I went to his premises, and saw the window broken; a ticket in my own hand-writing, which had been in the warehouse on the night of the 15th, was afterwards shown to me at the Thames Police-office - that ticket had been with the twine, and was missed from the warehouse; if it had been sold, the ticket would have been taken off - when I take twine out for sale, I take off the ticket before I enter it in the book; I afterwards saw some twine and a bundle of cord at the Thames Police-office.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  FITCH
               



            . I am the wife of James Fitch. The prisoner Hook came to our house on the 17th of December; my husband was not at home - Hook asked me for the horse and cart, which I lent him; the cart was empty when he took it away, between five and six o'clock in the evening - he brought it back in about an hour, nearly full of rope and twine; it remained there till the evening of the 21st, and was then taken away.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Had you seen Hook before that? A. Yes; I do not know the prosecutor's premises.


                  JAMES 
                  FITCH
               



            . I live at No. 1, Sydney-street, Poplar. On the 18th of December I saw Hook, whom I have known some years: he engaged me to drive this rope and twine over to the Borough, and promised to meet me there, but he did not come - I brought it back to my own yard, and it remained there till the 21st, when it was taken away; on Sunday, the 20th, I saw Hook, Wakeley, and another man - they were looking about my yard, and at the cart, and the goods in it; I was in the stable - they afterwards came into the stable to me, and asked if I or Amsdell were going to stand any thing to drink; I fetched some gin, and it was drank between us.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Then you had these in your possession four or five days? A. It was there from the 17th to the 21st; any one might have seen it - Wakeley had hired my cart before; he is a marine-store dealer, I believe; Amsdell is a baker, and his cart stands on my premises - I did not stand the drink.
COURT. Q. How long have you known Hook? A. Four or five years; he is a fisherman - the twine was a great deal like fishermens' twine - I had no suspicion but that it was his property.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Was it small twine? A. Yes.


                  AMELIA 
                  FITCH
               



            . I am daughter of James Fitch: I know Hook; I saw him in the yard, and Wakeley came while he was there - they were looking into the cart.
Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.Did you not show Wakeley the way into the yard? A. Yes; I saw him conversing with Hook, and go away.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Were you at home on the Friday or Saturday? A. No, I was at my aunt's; I have known Hooks a long while.


                  JOHN 
                  AMSDELL
               



            . I am a baker, and live at No. 44, Well-street, Poplar; I keep a horse and cart at Mr. Fitch's yard. On the 20th of December I went to have my horse cleaned; I saw Hook and Fitch there, and I afterwards saw Wakeley - Fitch was in the stable, doing up his horse - I was doing the same; I saw Hook and Wakeley looking into the cart, which was there, and had some rope and line in it - there was some gin fetched.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Fitch a friend of yours? A. No, not particularly so, only I have kept my horse and cart there about sixteen months, and pay him.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Who paid for the gin? A.Wakeley - I did not notice that Fitch looked into the cart; he did not exercise any authority over it.

                  TURNER
               



            . On the 20th of December I went by the side of the water at Limehouse-cut; I saw Goddard and two other men raking little bundles of rope out of the cut with a rake and a boat-hook; I knew Goddard before- he said to me, "Don't take notice;" I am sure he said that - he was laying the bundles of rope on the side of the bank; I had seen him a day or two before, near the same place, with a sack, which appeared full of something - I asked him how heavy it was; he said very heavy, and I said he might put it into my cart - he did so, and a good way further on he took it out and put it on his shoulder; he asked me to drive on, because he wanted to make haste - the roads were very slippery, and it would not have been safe for me to have gone fast; it appeared to me there was some rope-yarn in it.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.What day was it? A. I cannot tell: I believe it was on a Tuesday - it was in December; I had a butt and some wash in it; I was in Bromley-lane; it was about two days before I saw Goddard with the other men; I do not know whether they were White and Judge, the officers - I did not say at the office that they were; I said I could not tell whether they were there or not - I did at first say White was one and Judge the other, and swore so; I believe the day was before Christmas - I will not swear that; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning -

                  King
               



             was with me; I did not observe any person going by.


                  THOMAS 
                  GRAY
               



            . I am a Thames Police-officer. On the 23rd of December I apprehended Hook at his house; I told him it was on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Newman's, at Deptford-creek - I did not threaten or promise him any thing, but the next day he told me that two men in a ship's boat, came and brought a quantity of line and twine to him - that he had hired a cart of Fitch's, and Fitch was not at home; he said he did not know the man who brought it to him, but he was to dispose of it, if hecould; that he could not dispose of it, and took it to Limehouse-cut, and hove it overboard; I asked if he knew the two men; he said he would tell me no more, as he had told me enough; I went to Wakeley's on the 22nd (I believe) with Judge and White - I found a quantity of lines, twines, and a bundle of box cord; some of them were in a water-butt; the officer who executed the warrant asked him about them, and he said Goddard brought them to his house - Wakeley is a dealer in marine-stores, and keeps a melting place: he had a crucible on the fire, and ran down 2 cwt. of metal while we were there: he is in an extensive line.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been an officer? A.Thirteen years; I never saw any silver melted at Wakeley's, but I have copper - it might be in his way of trade; he was in his back premises - the place is open in the day time; there was some new copper concealed under some sacks - White took that, but we have found no charge against him for that, but he could not give a satisfactory account of it before the Magistrate; he has been employed at that for years; I saw the twine found in the butt - I was at the cut on the 24th or 25th, I believe - I did not see Turner there; it was in the afternoon - I found some rope, which was rather dirty; that was not the reason which Wakeley assigned for putting it into the water-butt.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.You did not persuade Hook to say any thing? A. No; I did not upon my oath - he boys some sort of twine for use in his business; I asked if he knew the two men, and he said he did not - I did not caution him against telling any thing.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What time did you go to the cut? A.About twelve o'clock.
WILLIAM JUDGE. I went with this witness and White to Wakeley's premises, and in a stable, at the back of the premises; I saw a water-butt - I found something in it, got the tongs, and found a bundle of twelve skeins of box cord - Goddard and Wakeley were both present; I went the next day to the cut, with White, Gray, and Hughes, and found twenty-two skeins of what is called ground twine and thirty-eight skeins of twine and line - this is it.
Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.What did either Wakeley or Goddard say? A.Goddard said, "We washed it all there;" we went to the cut, because Goddard said, if any body would go with him to the place, he would show where he took it up; he said, there was some more, no doubt - on the first day I had only a boat-hook and a rake to get it out, and on the second day, I got a pair of drags.


                  JAMES 
                  WHITE
               



            . I am a Thames Police-officer; I went to Wakeley's. and found him in the melting place, and Goddard with him; I said I came to look for some rope and twine, Wakeley said, "Very well, look round" - I looked round and found it - Wakeley said Goddard brought it in about an hour before: Goddard said he had been to drown a cat in the cut, and had found it swimming there; I am sure he said that - Judge found twelve skeins of cord, but I was not there.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Then what Wakeley said, turned out to be true? A. Yes.
MR. NEWMAN. None of these articles would swim, they would sink like stones.


                  ALEXANDER 
                  HUGHES
               



            . I am an officer of the Thames Police; I found this ticket on part of the twine pulled out of the cut.


                  JAMES 
                  VALLOR
               



            . This is the ticket which was on the ground twine at Mr. Newman's; I have looked at all the property, and believe it is all, that which was stolen from his premises.
Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Can you swear to this ticket as your hand-writing? A. Yes; it is never sent out with the goods - it is my place to take it off, and enter the goods in the book; I have sent out the goods ever since I have been there.
MR. HEATON to MR. NEWMAN. Q. Is the cord in the state, in which it is sold? A. It is a little altered with the wet - it has all little pieces of string to which tickets have been attached, and they have been torn off, which they are not when it is sold; the persons who came to me on the 11th of December, came to sell rope - we frequently buy old rope.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have customers any thing to do with the window, you saw Hook examining? A. No.
Wakeley's Defence. I am, it is true, numbered with marine store dealers, but my trade is a brass and copper manufacturer.
Goddard's Defence. I found the articles.

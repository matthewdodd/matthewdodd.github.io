HENRY WOODMAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of December, 1 shawl, value 5s., the goods of 




Thomas Smith; and that he had been before convicted of felony.





ROBERT CAPON
. I live with Mr. Thomas Smith, a pawnbroker in Edgeware-road. We had a shawl hanging at the door for sale, on the 1st of December—it was safe at nine o'clock—I missed it—this now produced is it—it is my master's.





SAMUEL BARKER
. I am shopman to Mr. Mills, of the Edgeware-road. On the 1st of December I saw the prisoner take the shawl down, and pass it to another boy, who ran down Star-street—I took the prisoner, and hallooed out—the other boy threw the shawl down and got off—a man picked up the shawl, and gave it to me—I am quite sure the prisoner took it down.





JAMES M'REATH
 (police-constable D 176.) I took the prisoner and have the shawl, which I received from Barker.

Prisoner's Defence. I went out to go to my brother-in-law; I never touched the shawl; I was walking along; I never ran.





WILLIAM JACOCKS
 (police-sergeant D 81.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

HENRY SCOTT
. I am a confectioner, and live in Narrow-street, Lime-house. On the 16th of November, I was going along Shad well, and saw the prisoner take a pair of trowsers from the prosecutor's shop—they were hanging on a nail inside—he took them about three yards from the door, and hid them under his jacket—I collared him, and shoved him into the shop—Mr. Fryett sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—he said, "Here are your trowsers, let me go"—some duplicates were found on him at the station-house.

Prisoner. I say you are a false-swearer.





JOHN WILLIAM FRYETT
. I am a pawnbroker, and keep a shop in High-street, Shadwell. I received information on the 16th of November, which induced me to examine my shop, and I missed a pair of trowsers—these are them—I saw the prisoner when he was brought into the shop—he had them under his arm—he threw them down, and said, "Let me go"—they had been inside the door.

Prisoner. They were outside.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

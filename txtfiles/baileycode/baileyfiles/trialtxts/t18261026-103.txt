JOHN CLUTTERBUCK. I am a blind-maker. On the 10th of October, I saw the two prisoners by the Three-compasses public-house, in the Mile-end-road


, about a hundred yards from Mr. Richardson's, about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening - I knew Bright before; they were in company, and had these wheels on their shoulders - I heard Bright say, "Let us put them down, we can run them the quicker" - they did so - I seized Bright, and called Stop thief! and Robinson was taken.
JOHN RICHARDSON. I lay the gas-pipes - these wheels are mine: they were on the premises of a friend of the name of Buck, two or three hundred yards from me - I leave them there almost every day.

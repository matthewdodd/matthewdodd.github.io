            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Southampton-row. On the 28th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Skinner-street


; a person called to me, and produced my handkerchief; I then missed it - the prisoner was in custody.

            . I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Peter-street, St. John-street. I was in Skinner-street, and observed the prisoner with a boy about ten years old, following the prosecutor very close. I saw the boy draw the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the prisoner; he turned back, and I seized him with it in his hand; I told the prosecutor who took it. The prisoner said it flew into his hands. I am certain they were in concert together.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I lodge at the George-inn in Long-acre


. Last Sunday morning, when I got up, I missed my watch; the prisoner at the bar had been drawer in that house a little better than a week.
Q. How long have you lodg'd there?
Brooks. I lodg'd there two months.
Q. What sort of a watch was it?
Brooks. It was a silver watch, with the inside case gilt.
Q. Where did you miss it from?
Brooks. From out of my breeches pocket. I went to bed about twelve in the night, and my bedfellow, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Clifford 
               



            , got up before me, and he could not find his breeches for some time; he telling me he had lost his breeches, I laugh'd at him; after some time he found, his on the other side of the room; he felt, and found there was no money in them; he threw them down, and said they were none of his; then I thought proper to see for mine. I look'd where I had laid them at going to bed. I found them, but missed my watch from out of my pocket. The boy at the bar absented himself before I was got up.
Q. Who keeps the inn?
Brooks. His name is 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Barber 
               



            . The boy had told us, when he came first, he worked up his passage from Yorkshire; we thought he was gone down again. We went to Billingsgate to see for him, but did not find him there; then I went and searched the night-cellars; then I wrote an advertisement, and when I was in Fleet-street, going to put it in the Daily Advertiser, a man came and told me the boy was taken and put into the Compter. I went there to see him, and they told me the constable had taken the watch from him; and the next day I saw it produced before Sir Crisp Gascoyne.
Q. Did you lose any thing else besides your watch?
Brooks. I miss'd 2 s. 6 d. at the same time out of my pocket.
Q. What time of the morning did you miss your watch and money?
Brooks. About 7 in the morning. The boy confessed every thing before the justice in my hearing.


                  Thomas 
                  Clifford 
               



            . I was bedfellow to the other witness. When I was getting up, I missed my breeches from under my head.

Q. When was this ?
Clifford. This was on Sunday morning last, a little before seven o'clock. I took my breeches up two or three times, and did not know them again, because the money was gone out, there was no money in them, and I found them on the other side the room.
Q. What money had you in them at going to bed?
Clifford. I had five guineas, two half-guineas, 7 s. and 4 d. We suspected the boy, because when we got up he was gone.
Q. Where did you see him afterwards?
Burton. I was with him the same day at night, in the Compter, and he confessed to me he had my money.
Q. How much did he confess he had?
Clifford. Five guineas, two half-guineas, 7 s. and 4 d. and that he took it out of my breeches.
Q. Have you got any of it again?
Clifford. I have some of it; the constable delivered it to me.


                  John 
                  Carr 
               



            . I lay in the house of 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Barber 
               



             the same night, in the morning when I got up, I heard of this robbery; in the day there came a letter to the house from Wood-street Compter, giving an account that they had got the boy there, and that he had robbed somebody of a watch, five guineas, two half-guineas, and some silver. I went with the prosecutors to the Compter, the constable had taken the watch from the boy, and the keeper of the goal had some of the money, which they produced. The boy confessed in my hearing he had taken the watch, the property of 
               
                  Ephraim 
                  Brooks 
               



            , and the money, the property of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Clifford 
               



            , and that he had given a guinea and two shillings to a prisoner to get an escape for him, who said he would not give it him back again.
Q. Where did you hear him confess this?
Carr. I heard him confess the whole fact before Sir Crisp Gascoyne, and also in the Compter.


                  Joseph 
                  Barber 
               



            . I keep the George-inn, in Long-acre. The boy at the bar came and begged of me to take him in to ride horses, and run on errands, and the like. He cry'd much, and begged I'd try him, I took compassion on him, and took him; he had been with me about a week before the fact was committed. I went to the Compter, and heard him confess he took away the watch, and money mentioned. And I also heard him confess the same before Sir Crisp Gascoyne.
Q. Where is the constable?
Barber. He is not here.
Q. Is he bound over to prosecute?
Barber. He is.
Q. What is his name?
(He was called but did not appear.)
Prisoner's defence.
I am hardly 12 years of age.




               Guilty of stealing, but not in the dwelling house
            . The constable's recognizance ordered to be estreated.

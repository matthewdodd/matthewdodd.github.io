JOHN DAVIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 



Frederick Alexander Curling.






FREDERICK ALEXANDER CURLING
. I live in Fenchurch-buildings. On the night of the 14th of September I was in Newgate-street, about ten o'clock, and felt a pull at my pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner immediately behind me—I laid hold of him, and on turning him round saw my handkerchief under his feet on the pavement—I called for a policeman—one came up, and I gave him into custody—nobody was near enough to touch my pocket but the prisoner—he pointed to a person who was passing, and said, "That is the man," but the person was inside, near the houses, and the handkerchief was under the prisoner's feet.

Prisoner, I was passing along—another man pushed by me, and in about a minute the gentleman turned round; he laid hold of me, and asked if I had his handkerchief—I said I had not, and he looked round and found it on the ground—I did not offer to pick his pocket at all.





WILLIAM WHITING
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and received the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Serjeant Arabin.

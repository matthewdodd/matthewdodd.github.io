RICHARD TAYLOR
 and 




JOHN GREENHAM
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
31st of July, 152lbs. weight of lead, value 7l.; and 1 copper, value 10s. the goods of 



Ann Bartram, and fixed to a certain building.






JOHN LOGAN GROVER
. I am agent to Ann Bartram—she has a house at No. 9, York-place, Pentonville. On the 1st of August I saw several holes, and I found the lead was taken off the gutters, and the copper was taken out of its place in the back kitchen, and brought into the back parlour—I have seen the lead produced fitted, and it exactly matches—I had seen the lead safe two or three days before.





JOHN HARNWORTH
. I live in York-street, Pentonville. On the 31st of July I was at work at York-place—the copper was firmly fixed—I had not been on the roof—I saw two persons lurking about that evening—I should not know them again.





WILLIAM HARRIS
 (police-constable N 112.) On the 31st of July, at a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoners going down Battle-bridge—Taylor was carrying this lead in a sack on his back—I crossed and asked what they had got—they said nothing—Taylor dropped it and attempted to run off—I laid hold of him, and asked where he got it from—he said, "From nowhere"—I have compared the lead with the premises, and it fits exactly.

Taylor's Defence. Two men gave it to me to carry, and I said I did not know what it was. Could that roof be stripped at a quarter after eight? and who swears we stole the copper?





WILLIAM HARRIS

re-examined. He said first he had got nothing, and then he said he did not know where he got it—at the station-house they said they saw two other sweeps, who got them to carry it.

TAYLOR*—


GUILTY

GREENHAM*—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.

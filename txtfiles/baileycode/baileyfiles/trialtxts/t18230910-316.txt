            . I am a journeyman silversmith
, and live in Monkwell-street. On the 3d of August, about ten o'clock at night, I was passing along Bloomsbury


, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw somebody running along the other side of the way; Riley brought the prisoner up to me, and said, he had picked my pocket; I then felt, and missed my handkerchief. Riley produced it.

            . I am a patrol of Bloomsbury. About ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and two others at the corner of George-street, I watched them; the prosecutor and a female went by - they both followed behind; the prisoner stopped down, and took the handkerchief out of his pocket, turned round and ran against me; I seized him, and said,
"Ned, this won't do;" he immediately dropped it, and I picked it up, and called to the people to stop the prosecutor.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He laid hold of me, and said I stole the handkerchief - he found it on the ground.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 15.

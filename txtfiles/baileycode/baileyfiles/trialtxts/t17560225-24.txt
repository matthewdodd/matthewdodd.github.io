                  Gawson 
               



            . I am wife to John; I live in Shoreditch


. The prisoner was my servant
; these things were taken away at divers times. I suspected her, and went to enquire at the pawnbroker's, and found all the goods mentioned in the indictment, with her name upon them. Then I took her up, and she acknowledged them to be my property.
Q. Where were these goods before you missed them ?
G. Gawson. She took the sheets off her own bed, and the handkerchiefs out of my drawer; and she own'd the same. The two-pawnbrokers that had the goods, and the constable that now has them, are not here; I have sent a person after the constable, and he can't be found.
Prisoner. I beg the court will be favourable.

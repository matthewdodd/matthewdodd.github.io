CHARLES CONSTABLE. I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's - I saw her pushing this gown under the bed; I called her into the front room, and asked what she had done with her mistress' gown; she said she knew nothing about it - I said, "I think it is under the bed," and pulled it out.(Property produced and sworn to.)

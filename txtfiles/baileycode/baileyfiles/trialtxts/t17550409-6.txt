                  Clifford 
               



            . I live in King-street, near Golden-square


; I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment, but can't tell exactly the day.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
Clifford. She was my servant
. On a Saturday-night in March, to the best of my knowledge, it was three weeks ago last Saturday; she went to fetch my little girl from school, and did not return back again, and in that evening we missed the goods, then I suspected her. I went to seek for her and found her; I asked her if she had taken these things? she denied every thing, but desired she might go to her mother; I let her; there she owned to the taking of one shirt, and said she lent it to a soldier in Peter-street, Westminster, to put on to go to be reviewed, and it would be returned. She was sent to the watch-house, and the next morning before the justice she confessed to the taking another shirt and handkerchief.
Q. Did she say what she had done with them?
Clifford. She said she had pawned them; on the Monday morning she was had before the justice again, then she owned she had taken an apron and pawned that also, and since she has been in confinement her mother brought them all to me.
Prisoner's defence.
I intended to bring them home again, and not to keep them.

EDWARD ROWLAND
 and 




JOHN ASHTON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
7th of December, 28lbs. weight of sugar, value 20s. the goods of 



James Donmett Jackson; and that Rowland had been previously convicted of felony.






FREDERICK JACKSON
. I am servant to James Donmett Jackson, a grocer, in Watling-street. On the 7th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner Rowland take some sugar off a box by the shop-door, and go down the street with it—he dropped it at the next house but one—I rapped at the partition for my brother to come oat, and we followed him—Ashton was running down the street before Rowland—I had not seen him about the shop.





RICHARD GEORGE TATHAM
. I am an officer of Cordwainers' Ward. I saw the prisoners leaving Mr. Jackson's shop-door—Rowland had a bundle in his arm, and, about six yards from the door, (whether they were changing it from one to the other or not I do not know, but) the sugar fell between the two—I took Rowland, and the watchman collared Ashton, round the corner, in Bow-lane—I am certain I saw them both come from the door with it, together, and go into the road together.





JOHN HARVEY
. I am a watchman. About eight o'clock at night I heard a call of "Stop thief," and I saw Street and Tatham running after the prisoners—Rowland fell down, and Street took hold of him—followed Ashton, and took him in Bow-lane, without losing sight of him.





JAMES DONMETT JACKSON
. This loaf of sugar is mine.





CHARLES BURGESS
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of Rowland's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I was present last May, when he was convicted of breaking a window, and taking out four books—(read)—I was present when he was tried, and am certain of him.

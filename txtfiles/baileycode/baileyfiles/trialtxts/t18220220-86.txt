            . I keep a chop-house in Coleman-street


, opposite Mr. Rich's. I was standing at my door between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner and a man loitering about Rich's window. I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and come out - I crossed over and took him, with a hat in his hand, and a pair of gloves in it; he said some men persuaded him to do it.

            . I live opposite End, and am a stationer
, I was in the parlour - my hat was on the counter - a boy came in twice on a paltry excuse; the prisoner was soon after brought in with it; he fell on his knees and begged for mercy.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

THOMAS FLEMING
. I am a commercial traveller. On the evening of the 15th of December, I was walking in Crown-street, St. Giles', with a gentleman—I felt, something at my pocket—I turned, and caught the prisoner close to me with my handkerchief in his hand—he dropped it—this is it.

Prisoner. The handkerchief was at my feet, and I picket it up—four or five persons behind me saw me do it. Witness. It is quiet impossible that he could—I felt the twitch, and turned immediately—he begged my pardon.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

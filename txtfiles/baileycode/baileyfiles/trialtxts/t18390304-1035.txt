JAMES HEFFERMAN
. I am a servant out of place—I sleep in Orange-court, Drury-lane. On Sunday night, the 5th of March, the prisoner slept in the same room—he got up at six o'clock in the morning, and went away—before he got out of the house I missed my hat—I got out of bed, followed him down stairs, and took it from him on the stairs—I returned to, my room, and missed my waistcoat—the landlord went after him, and I found him at the station-house with the waistcoat.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
. I am a policeman. I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner ran up George-street—I took him as he was running away, and found the waistcoat on him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

WILLIAM SMITH
 and 




JAMES FERRYMAN
 was indicted for

13th of April, 1 pair of trowsers, value 5s., 6d., the goods of 



Mary Ann Couchman.






WILLIAM MOYES
. I live in Boziers'-court, Oxford-street, with Mary Ann Couchman, who keeps a clothes-shop. I was in the shop in the afternoon of the 13th of April—I heard something, and ran out—I saw the two prisoners run out of the court—I ran after them—I caught Ferryman, and brought him back—I found these trowsers in the hand of M'Donald—they are Mrs. Couchman's.





JAMES M'DONALD
. I was sweeping a shop in the court for a boy, and I saw Smith take the trowsers off the hook, and put them under the tail of Ferryman's coat—they then began to walk off, and then they ran away—I told the butcher-boy, and he called his father—I ran after them, and saw Ferryman throw the trowsers away.

Smith. He said it was not me that took them when I was brought back. Witness. No, I did not.





WILLIAM THOMAS MERRIT
. The witness M'Donald told me of this as I was coming down the court—I called to my father—I ran, and saw Smith run down Hanway-street, and he was in the act of tying his boot when my father took him—I saw Ferryman had the trowsers under his coat Smith. He said I was not the lad. Witness, I said to my father, "I don't think that is the lad"—I thought he was too respectable, but afterwards I noticed his jacket, and he is the boy.

Smith. I was playing with some boys, and they took me; I had not seen Ferryman for three or four days.

            . I live at No. 1, Upper Thames street


. I missed the things in the indictment on Easter-eve. The prisoner was my servant
; she went away that afternoon about three or four o'clock; neither I nor my wife were at home when she absconded. We never found her till last Saturday; then she owned to the taking the things, and went on her knees, and begged for mercy. She told us where she had pawned them; we went accordingly, and found them.
Elizabeth his wife, confirmed the account he had given.
Prisoner. I beg for mercy.

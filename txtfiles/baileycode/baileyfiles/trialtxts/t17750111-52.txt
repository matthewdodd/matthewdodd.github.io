            . I lodged in the same house with the prisoner. I put my box with my money in it in the room, where the prisoner and another young man lay: in one box there was a good deal of gold, and in a tin box there were three crown pieces; I missed the whole money; the prisoner was afterwards taken (two crown pieces produced in court.) I can swear to one of them, it is a queen Ann's.
- Robinson. I went to search the room where the two lads were; I required them both to produce their breeches, the prisoner delivered his breeches, and in his pocket I found the two crown pieces that are produced.
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought these crown pieces; some men were tossing up for money in the fields, and I gave them ten shillings and a pint of beer for them.
- Robinson. The prisoner before the justice said, he earned the two crowns.

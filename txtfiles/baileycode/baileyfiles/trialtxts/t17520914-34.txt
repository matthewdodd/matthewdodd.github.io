            . Coming over London-bridge


 the 26th of July about a quarter after 10 at night, the prisoner came to my right side and put his hand in my coat pocket, looked me in the face at the time, and look out my handkerchief.
Q. Did he meet or follow you?
Rose. He followed me. He gave my handkerchief over his shoulder to another boy, there were three of them, then the other two made off. I laid hold of the prisoner. I had a friend about a dozen yards from me, I called out and told him I had been robbed of my handkerchief; he could not take the others. I both felt the prisoner and saw him deliver my handkerchief very plain.

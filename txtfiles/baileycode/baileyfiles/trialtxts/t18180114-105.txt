JAMES THOMPSON. I am a corn-dealer, and live in High-street, Poplar. I saw the prisoners run up to the corner of Queen-street into Mr. Holles's lobby; I there saw them tying up some things - I told Renfold to watch them while I went to see who had lost any thing; when I returned they were gone up Poplar - I ran after them, and left Renfold watching there, and went for Smith, the officer, and gave them in charge of Thompson, the officer. When we took Wright he said he would cut my throat.
JOSEPH RENFOLD. I am a corn-dealer. I saw the prisoners standing at the pawnbroker's lobby door, wrapping something up; I ran up Hale-street, came down again, and stopped the prisoner, Smith, with a bundle, and asked him what he had got? he said, what was it to me - I told him I thought he had not come honestly by it; he said he brought it from Shadwell to pledge at Poplar, and would show me where he got it.
JAMES THOMPSON. I took the prisoners in charge.

GEORGE WATERMAN
. I am a policeman. I met the prisoner in Wentworth-street, about a quarter part one o'clock in the morning of the 6th of April, carrying a bundle—I stopped him—he had these things in a

blue pocket-handkerchief—I asked what he had got—he said, Harness, to he sure"—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, "To take it home, to be sure"—I asked whose it was—"My own," he said, to be sure"—an officer came up—I told him to take him to the station—he then threw down this harness, and ran away—I stopped behind—the officer pursued, and took him.

Prisoner. Q. Was there any one with me? Witness. Not at that time—there was somebody fifteen or twenty yards ahead of him, but he had nothing.





RICHARD COOPER
. I am a policeman. I was with Waterman—what he has stated is correct—I saw the prisoner throw down this bundle, and run away—I ran and took him.

Prisoner. I did not run away—I stood my ground. Witness. He ran about thirty yards.





JAMES WALTON
. This is my farther Edward Walton's harness—it Was taken from my horse's head, at the corner of Goulston-street—I had left it from three to five minutes, at a door.

Prisoner, He said at the office, that he had left it five or ten minutes—the young man with me asked me to recommend him A lodging, and he gave me this bridle to hold, and walked on.

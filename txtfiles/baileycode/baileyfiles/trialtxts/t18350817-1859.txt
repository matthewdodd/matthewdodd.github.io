HENRY WALKDEN
 was again indicted

 for embezzlement.






JEFFFERY JOHN EDWARDS
. On the 3d of July, Mr. Hemming's clerk called to pay 10l. on the warrant of attorney; he asked me for a receipt, which I said I would not give, but I would acknowledge it by letter; and I told him to tell Mr. Hemming to come and settle the accounts on the warrant of attorney; he said he had paid some—I said "No; "I looked at the prisoner and said, "Has he?" the prisoner said "No, Sir," I then went into my room, and heard no more conversation—on the 11th of August I saw Mr. Fry and Mr. Hemming—I asked why he had not paid the warrant of attorney—he said he had paid three payments—the prisoner then admitted that he had received the last 10l. and spent it.

Cross-examined by
MR. DUNBAR. Q. What salary did you give the prisoner? A. 12s. 6d. a week—it was formerly 10s.—he had authority to get the warrant of attorney executed, but not to receive this money—he had a general authoriity to receive money—I did not know that this warrant was executed—he came to me in 1833—I joined partnership with Mr. Froude in November last, but the prisoner had a general authority to receive money—Mr. Wright was not the only person entrusted to receive money—he is not here.





AUGUSTUS FREDERICK HEMMING
. I paid the prisoner, on the 30th of April, 10l., and on the 30th of May, 10l—the first was a Somersetshire-note, and the second a Bank of England-note—these are the receipts the prisoner gave me.





JOHN SPEDDING FROUDE
. The prisoner never accounted to me for these sums.
(Mr. Frazer, a barrister; Mr. Spring, of Great Portland-street; and Robert Jackman, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 21.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.

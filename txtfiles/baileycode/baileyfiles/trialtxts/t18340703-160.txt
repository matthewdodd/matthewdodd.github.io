ANN MOORE. I am a widow
, and live in Shuter's-buildings, Somers-town


. On the morning of the 10th of June I was in bed, with my children, in the room down stairs, (about half-past six or a quarter to seven,) and I saw the prisoner at my drawers - she had opened the door, and come in, and gone to the drawers - I must have been asleep when she entered - I immediately got out of bed, and tried to catch her, but she ran out - I made an alarm, and cried,"Stop thief" - I then missed the watch from the mantel-piece - I had seen it safe at ten o'clock the night before - a man in the court ran after her, and caught her.

            . I heard the alarm, and ran and took the prisoner - I then went to my work, and in three quarters of an hour two policemen came and asked where I took her - I showed them the spot, and they found the watch there behind some shutters in a passage, which is not a thoroughfare.

             (police-constable S 30). I went and found the watch - I took it to the prisoner, and said,"What do you say about the watch now?" - she said it was the first time that ever she took any thing.
Prisoner. I used to go every morning to light the fire for her, and she gave me a half-penny.

            . Upon my oath I never saw her - I live with my mother, but she has no girl of any description.

, July 9
.
Ynur Lloyd thus depos'd. About one o'clock last Saturday Morning, the Prisoner pick'd me up in Fleet street, and carried me to a House in Shoe Lane


. - We went up Stairs about a little private Business, and while we were upon the Bed together, I felt her Hand in my Pocket, I ask'd her what Business it had there, She made me no answer, but got off the Bed, and run down Stairs, and so out of Doors. - I mist my Money and follow'd her as soon as I had put up my Breeches, but she was got out of sight. I was confoundedly next, and knew not what Course to take. At last I told the Watch of it, and desired them to stop such a Woman if they met her. They said there were a great many Baudy Houses thereabouts, and they'd go with me and Search them. So they got the Constable, and we went together; - We presently came to one of them, and knockt at the Door; it was a long time before we got them to open it, but when we came in, the second Person that I saw was the Prisoner.
The Prisoner in her Defence, said that she never saw the Prosecutor in her Life, till he came and took her out of that House, where she went to receive a little Money that was due to her. That he was so drunk that he could not stand, and sometimes said that he had lost more Money, and sometimes less. 


               Guilty 10 d.

JOHN SHEDDEN SCRimgEOUR. On the 25th of August I felt something at my pocket, I turned round and collared a man, but I cannot say it was the prisoner - the officer came and took him - the officer took up my handkerchief, which was safe an hour before.

            . I am the watchman; I saw the prisoner and two others following the prosecutor about fifteen yards; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the pocket, and then the other two went away - I crossed over, and saw the handkerchief on the ground - I seized the prisoner, and took up the handkerchief.
Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there not a great many people about? A. Yes; there was a dreadful storm at the time - the lightning did not frighten me.(Property produced and sworn to.)

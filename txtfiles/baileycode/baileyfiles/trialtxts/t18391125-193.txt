JAMES CASEY
 and 




GEORGE WELCH
 were again indicted for

burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



John Henry Robson, about the hour of nine in the night of the 
22nd of November, at the
 liberty of the Tower, with intent to steal, and stealing therein, 32 boxes of matches, value 2s., and 3 snuff-boxes, value 4s., his goods.






JOHN HENRY ROBSON
. I am a tobacconist, and live in Postern-row, Tower-hill. On Friday night, the 22nd of November, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I noticed a piece of glass broken in a pane in my shop-window, which was safe at half-past nine o'clock—it had been puttied about six months—the glass was taken out, and three snuff-boxes and thirty boxes of lucifer-matches taken—my house is in the liberty of the Tower—I have the shop, parlour, and two bed-rooms—the house is divided into two shops—the landlord does not live there.





JAMES RUDDIPATH
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoners at two o'clock in the morning—I found two snuff-boxes on Casey, and a snuff-box and oyster-knife on Welch—they said they had found them opposite St. Katherine Dock-gates—I found a few lucifer-matches on Casey, I think.





JOHN HENRY ROBSON

re-examined. These are part of the articles I lost—one portion of the square of glass was cut out, sufficiently to admit two hands.

JAMES GLOSTER
 and 



THOMAS JACKSON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
13th of June, 2 baskets, value 2s.; and 60 dead fish, called mackerel, value 13s.; the goods of 



William Young.






WILLIAM YOUNG
. On the 13th of June I was at Billingsgate—I bought sixty mackerel, and placed them in two baskets, on my dog-cart—I went down into the market again to buy some eels, and when I returned, I heard the basket, and mackerel, and all were gone; the man that minds the carts had run after the thieves, but did not take them.





ALFRED KNIGHT
. I clean my master, Mr. Neeve's, boots and shoes, and go to Billingsgate school. On the 13th of June I was standing at the corner of a lane near Billingsgate, and saw the two baskets of mackerel standing—I saw the two prisoners come down St. Mary Hill, and go up Cross-lane, and then they came and stood by the baskets—Jackson looked to see if any one was coming, and then went and put the basket of mackerel on Gloster's head—he went up Idol-lane, and the other went up St. Mary Hill—I am quite sure they are the same two—I had seen them about the market—I found them the next morning, and pointed them out to the officer.





WILLIAM BROWNUTT
. I am a constable of the market—I took the two prisoners the next morning—I know they are often in the market.

Gloster. I was at Billingsgate, and then at Spitalfields, and then I went home—I never saw any mackerel.


Jackson. I went and bought some fish, and went home—the next morning I was there again, and was taken.

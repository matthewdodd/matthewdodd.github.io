MARY MEHON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of July, 2 stockings, value 3s., the goods of 



John Higgs, her master.






ELIZABETH HARRIET HIGGS
. I am the wife of John Higgs, he lives in Hanover-street, Peckham. The prisoner lived with me before she went to the last place—after she was gone I missed a great number of things-among the rest, two stockings, but being odd ones, I had no idea of their being stolen—these are mine-(looking at them.)

Prisoner. Q. Why should you think that I took them, when you gave them to me because you burnt mine? A. I burnt an old pair of hers, which I would not suffer to be washed—I gave her three pairs, but not these.

Prisoner. You rolled up a bundle of things the night before I went, and there was this pair of stockings in them, and you said if I did not like to keep them I might throw them away. Witness. I did, but not these things, and she went away and left the bundle there, and did not take them.

COURT. Q. Did you ever give her these stockings? A. No, she was

not authorised by me to take them—I am sure they were not in the bundle.





WILLIAM SPONG
 (police-constable P 96.) On the 29th of July I went to Mr. Burton's, No. 6, St. George's-place, and found these two odd stockings in the prisoner's box.




GUILTY

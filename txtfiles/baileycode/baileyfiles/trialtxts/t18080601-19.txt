Q. Did you find the watches upon him. - A. No, I did not; there were two more in company with him.
Q. You are sure you saw this. - A. I am sure I saw this.
Q. Had you seen the watches there soon before this. - A. I had put them there a few hours before that; I have never seen them since.
Q. You had not seen him lurking about before this happened had you. - A. No; when I took him he said he had not been near the window; he attempted to get away from me, but I held him so close I prevented him.
Q.What was the value of your toy watches. - A. Seven shillings each.

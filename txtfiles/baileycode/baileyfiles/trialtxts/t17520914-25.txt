            . I am the owner of several packhorses
 that go betwixt Preston in Lancashire and London, 16 of them went out from the Swan and two necks in Lad-lane, London, the 24th of July, all loaded but one, which a woman passenger rode upon. I went as far as Islington and parted with them between 6 and 7 in the evening, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Fenton 
               



             was the driver. I went back to the inn. I was called up about four the next morning, and was told I had been robbed. I went to Finchley common


 by my self. I met a hay cart, and the man that drove it told me there was a box taken up found on Finchley common I stopped at the Wrestlers at Highgate, the landlord there sent people out into the woods to see if they could find any of the goods ; there was a wrapper found, marked R. Addison, Preston, with no goods in it lying a little way out of the road, on the back of a garden on Finchley common. Mr. Swain joined me on the Common, we staid there till about 9 o'clock, and then returned to the Wrestlers at Highgate again. Some people had picked up some goods and brought them there; they were handkerchiefs and cambricks, one box that had been broke open, and the goods taken out to the value of 4 l. odd money; there was a box and a parcel, the box was directed for 
               
                  Agnes 
                  Branthwaite 
               



             at Cartmel, the parcel was directed to 
               
                  William 
                  Bare 
               



            , at Cartmel.
Q. Do you know who brought them there?
Glover. No, my lord, I do not. In one of the boxes there were womens black everlasting shoes, ribbons and other things, I can't tell the particulars. In the parcel there were blue and white handkerchiefs, and several goods besides, which came to 12 l. I staid there about half an hour, then brought the goods to London to where they were bought, in order to prepare a proper advertisement. I went then to Finchley, and had a search warrant, and searched two or three houses there, but found nothing at either. There was a box picked up on the Common by a man with a hay cart, which was carried to my inn, the cord was cut, but the box had not been opened, it was directed to esquire Bradeel at Preston. The robbery was on the Friday, I set out again for Lancashire on the Sunday morning, after leaving money in my landlord's hands for him to spare no cost in inquiring and advertising to find the goods. I overtook my man with the horses at Fenny Stratford, there was then one of the fifteen horses without a pack.
Q. Were these goods, you mention to have been found, put up in any of the packs which were on these fifteen horses?
Glover. They were. There were 14 packs arrived safe at Lancaster, one pack was taken away. I saw them all safe at Islington, when I returned to London at their going out.


                  Richard 
                  Fenton 
               



            . I am servant to 
               
                  George 
                  Glover 
               



            , I was the driver of these packhorses, my master and I set out on the 24th of July from Lad-lane, he left me at Islington and went back. When I came to Highgate, I had all my horses and packs, one horse carried a woman, and 15 with packs; I stopped and drank at the Wrestlers, and there told the horses over; it was then dark and a rainy night. I turned them before me, and did not stay above five minutes after them, and kept with them all the way till I came about a quarter of a mile beyond Brown's Wells, sometimes on the side and sometimes behind them on foot. Near the six mile stone, but it was so dark I could not see it, in telling them over I found the bald mare with her halter about her feet, and no pack on.
Q. Did you miss her out of the number before you found her unloaded?
Fenton. I told them and I thought I had made a mistake in telling them, so I ran forward and found she was about the third or fourth without a pack. Then I got upon her and looked about backwards and forwards for almost an hour, but could not find any thing; then I rode on and over-took the rest of the horses on this side Barnet; I believe it was then betwixt 10 and 11.
Q. Did you meet with any body that you drank with on the road?
Fenton. No, I did not. I was quite sober. I went on to my inn the White Lion at Coney, and got there betwixt 12 and one. Then I dispatched a messenger to let my master know what had happened, and proceeded for Lancashire.
Q. Did you search to see if your saddle things were cut?
Fenton. The saddle and girt were safe; but the wantey that fastened the pack on was taken away.
Glover. The wantey was found on Finchley common. I saw it on the Saturday morning, it appeared plain to be cut.
Q. to Fenton. Did you observe any body on the road that night molest you?
Fenton. No, I did not.

                  Booth 
               



            . I am a porter at the Swan and two recks in Lad-lane. On the 25th of July I was informed that the prosecutor had been robbed, and where, the night before. I was going towards Highgate to meet him, being told he was gone that way. I met Mr. Swain in Goswell street, he told me Mr. Glover had heard of two boxes and a paper parcel. I met him, he desired me to take them to the inn. There was one box directed to Eliz. Dickerson, Lancaster, the other to 
               
                  William 
                  Bare 
               



             of Cartmel ; the parcel to 
               
                  Alice 
                  Galter 
               



            , Lancaster. I know the particular things in one of the boxes, they were bought in Newgate-street of messieurs Tolfrey and Co. haberdashers and drapers. When Mr. Glover went out of town on the Sunday, he desired I'd do all I could to find the things and people. On Monday it was advertised by Mr. Swain, and at night there was a parcel brought by Thomas Hall. He told Mr. Swain there were very disorderly persons frequented a house in Wood's close, it was the house of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Morris 
               



            ; we got a search warrant and searched it; there we found some calico wrappers made into sheets, on two beds. I found one particular piece in the possession of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Lovyer 
               



            , there was some money and fruit lying on it, which she said were her property, it was marked with a particular mark. There were 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lovyer 
               



             and 
               
                  Peter 
                  Pearvoy 
               



             in the house, but they made their escape. I found some Hessian wrappers, there was one directed to J. Wearing, Preston, wrote with ink, they were cut and the goods taken out. There was another wrapper with A. Branthwaite, Cartmel. I found them in a shed in a back part of the house in a tub of water; there were some calico wrappers which had no directions on them. I found likewise Mr. Glover's packsheet, which I can safely swear to, that was put down into the vault. A few days after a person told me that 
               
                  Ruth 
                  Morris 
               



            's mother lived at Deptford; I went and found her, she had got a new callimanco drab coloured gown on, a pair of black everlasting shoes on her feet, and a green satin ribbon on her head. I asked her if she knew any thing of the goods? she knew me again by seeing me at the searching of the house. She carried me to an adjacent place in her mother's house, and there I found two pieces of brown callimanco, another piece of dark callimanco, some red, some yellow, of the remnant of which her gown was made. And likewise another gown cut out, which she said was for her sister. Some muslin wrappers, and calico wrappers, black gloves, white gloves, womens green shoes, a handkerchief with pins in it, a piece of new lawn, an apron. (These all produced in court at they were named over.) I brought her to town and had her committed.
Q. Was there ever a parcel in that pack marked R. Addison, Preston?
Booth. I know there was such a parcel, and things in it of the same quality, in one of the packs. There were callimancos, camblets, and other things. He produced part of a wrapper, which he said was found on Finchley common, marked R. Addison, Preston. I took Pearvoy on Ludgate-hill the Friday following, he looked very pale and said, before I had said a word to him, I know nothing of the matter. He knew me by seeing me at the search.
Thomas Hall. I live within two doors of the house of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Morris 
               



             in Wood's Close, I frequently used to see 
               
                  John 
                  Cornhill 
               



            , 
               
                  Peter 
                  Pearvoy 
               



            , and 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lovyer 
               



             together at his house, idling about in the skittle grounds. On the 27th of July, about half an hour after two o'clock, I met 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lovyer 
               



             with a bundle tied up in a blanket, I mistrusted all was not right, so I gave information, and the next day we went and searched the house of Morris and found, &c. The rest as the former witness.


                  Mary 
                  Ward 
               



            . I live in St. Bride's parish, I have been acquainted with 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Holmes 
               



             some time, I was at her house the 28th of July, she desired me to let a box of hers be at my house. After I got home 
               
                  Peter 
                  Pearvoy 
               



             followed me into my room and brought it, and went very hastily out again. (A box produced in court.) This is the very box. I went the next day again to her house ; she desired me to take a piece of callimanco and keep till her sister came out of trouble, which I did. After I heard of the things being lost, I went to Mr. Trotter, the constable, and told him I had got some goods at my house that I was not easy about, and desired he'd come and seize them. He came with an excise officer and took them away. I once lived fellow-servant with 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lovyer 
               



            .

Q. Can he speak English?
(Note, he had given the court much trouble to interpret to him, pretending he could not speak English.)
M. Ward. He can very well; he always talk'd good English to me.
Court. Ask him some questions.
M. Ward. How long did I live where you did?
Lovyer. About seventeen months.
M. Ward. How long have you been in England?
Lovyer. Above three years.
The piece of callimanco produced in court.
M. Ward. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Holmes 
               



             told me she had a gown of it cut out, and after her brother and sister were taken up, she would have it made up, and pawn it.
(Note the box was full of tea, and there was tea lost; but the box was not in the pack.)


                  Samuel 
                  Philipson 
               



            . I went with Booth and Hall to search the house of Morris. He confirmed the account of finding the things, &c. with this addition: I took Cornhill, and had him in my house; a little time after which he desired to go backwards to the necessary house. I went with him; but he shut himself in. After we had taken him before the justice, my little girl found a tobacco box in the necessary house, with two silk handkerchiefs cram'd into it, and when I came back she told me. I went there and found a powder horn and a little brass plate, and another silk handkerchief. He was searched before the justice, and three more handkerchiefs were found in his pocket.


                  Robert 
                  Smith 
               



            . I live in Newgate-street with Mr. Tolfrey and Co. haberdashers. The 24th of July we sent boxes and trusses, in number, I believe, about twenty, by 
               
                  George 
                  Glover 
               



            . I can't tell all the marks; but here is a mark of mine, which I wrote with a black pencil when I looked the goods out, on one of the callico wrappers. It is wrote: Thirty yards of this put up for 
               
                  John 
                  Wearing 
               



             of Preston. (He looks on it, and says, It is plain to be read now.) It was sent directed for 
               
                  John 
                  Wearing 
               



            , of Preston. The other goods here are the same sort of goods we sent; but there being no particular mark, I don't swear to them, but believe them to be what we sent within the wrapper. Here is my private mark on a paper in which six pair of womens black gloves are; here is a sort of cloth we always pack our goods up in, and the writing on it was by 
               
                  John 
                  Fourder 
               



            , who is here in court. (These goods he has looked on were found at Morris's house. He now looks on the goods found at Deptford, womens black leather gloves, pins, mens black gloves, womens shoes, and some silk gymps.) Of these I can swear I put the mark on six pair of womens gloves; and I made the mark on the board to the gymps. The gloves were for Addison, and the gymp for Branthwaite.


                  John 
                  Founder 
               



            . (Looks at the wrapper.) The mark on it is my hand writing. I carried about twenty-six boxes and things to the Swan and Two Necks in Lad-lane, the 24th of July.
Booth. That wrapper he speaks of was found in a tub of water at Morris's house.


                  Francis 
                  Fryer 
               



            . I am servant to 
               
                  Philip 
                  Brown 
               



             and comp. near the Monument. On the 24th of July we sent a truss, directed R. Addison, Preston, in which were two pieces of dark grey Irish camblets. (He looks at two pieces, and says they are like them.) One had a mark on the paper, by which he was positive it was one of them.
Mr. Trotter. I am constable of St. Bride's. This piece he swears to was with the box where the tea was. I measured it 45 yards.


                  Joseph 
                  Knight 
               



            . I live servant with Mr. Harris in Cannon-street, who deals in tea, and I carried some tea directed to Eliz. Hall at Poulton, to go by G. Glover, the 24th of July; there was 25 pound weight of it.
Trotter. On the 31st of July Mrs. Ward, and others that lodged where she lives, came to me and gave me information that there were goods in her apartment which were not lawfully come by, brought by 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lovyer 
               



            . She wanted me to come and take them away; I thinking them to be goods prohibited by the government, took an officer of the excise along with me. We took this box of tea out of her cellar, and carried it to the king's warehouse; she gave me also that piece of callimanco I have before mentioned. The tea weighted 30 pounds, box and all.
Booth. Looks at the gown found upon 
               
                  Ruth 
                  Morris 
               



            , and says, that and the piece of callimanco agree as to colour, &c.
Lovyer's defence.
I was at Mr. Morris's house backwards and forwards with my wife, that day. I went to carry some linen washed by my wife, who is sister to him, and he desired me to take that box to my house ; but not having room, he desired me to carry it to Mrs. Ward's; I knew nothing of what was in it. Pearvoy accidentally met with me just by the door, and accompanied me there.

Pearvoy's defence.
I know nothing of the things, but was at the house the day it was searched.
Mary Lovyer's defence.
I came out of my service the 20th of March, and was at my sister's house in White Friers. I asked 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Morris 
               



             to let me sit at his door to sell fruit, and went there, and happen'd to be there when the gentlemen came to search the house, but knew not what it was for.


                  Ruth 
                  Morris 
               



            's defence.
My husband brought these things into the house between nine and ten o'clock. He told me he had a license to sell things about the country, and gave me that gown, which I carried to the mantua-makers, but did not know that they were stolen.


                  Sarah 
                  Holmes 
               



            's defence.
They took me out of my house, and I don't know for what, nor ever saw any of the things.

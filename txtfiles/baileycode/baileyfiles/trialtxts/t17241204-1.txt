                     Rider , alias 
Regar




               
            , of S. Dunstan's in the East


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing fifty six Pound of Butter, value 25 s.
             the Goods of 
               
                  Rich.
                   Spearing
               




            , on the 23d of November
 last. It appear'd, that sixty Firkins of Butter were landed near the Custom-House Key


, for the Prosecutor; one of them was between Three and Four in the Morning taken from thence by the Prisoner, who was stopt with it under the Custom-House Gate by 
               
                  Philip 
                  Harrison 
               



            , (a Tide-waiter.) Harison had but just eased the Prisoner of his Burden, when Peacock (a Watchman on the Keys) came up and claim'd a Share of the Seizure; for both he and Harrison at first imagined the Prisoner to be a Smugler; but finding their Mistake, they carry'd him to the Watch-house, and the next Day he was committed to Newgate by Sir 
               
                  Francis 
                  Forbes 
               



            . The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he found the Butter upon the Keys, about Four in the Morning and added, (to make his Innocence more visible) that a Carman's Boy saw him take it away. The Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

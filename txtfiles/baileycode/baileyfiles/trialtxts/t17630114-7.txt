Jos. Sutton. On the 6th of this instant I had been serving a lady in my shop, I went out for change, it was in the dusk of the evening; coming back, the prisoner had got my shew-glass with the buckles, mentioned in the indictment, on it under his arm; seeing me, he let it fall; it did not fall into the street, but upon the iron which is on the out-side of the place where it stands to secure it, and the heaviest part of it fell within side; that the prisoner ran down Bedfordbury; I called, stop thief, he was taken and brought back, and had before Justice Fielding, who committed him.

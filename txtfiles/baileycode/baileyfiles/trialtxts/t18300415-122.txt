            . I live at Bishop's Stortford, and am a perfumer
. On Tuesday morning last, about a quarter to one o'clock, I was on Fish-street-hill


, and felt a pressure behind me, and somebody treading on my heels - I looked round, and the prisoner rushed from behind me; he crossed the road, and under his coat I saw a small part of a handkerchief, which was the colour of mine; I followed and caught him; I think he had a companion, but he must have run a contrary way - I laid hold of him immediately, and found my handkerchief on him; I know it was safe not two minutes before - he said he did not take it; he had passed it from his coat into his trousers while he was running - I found it there, and took him to the watch-house.

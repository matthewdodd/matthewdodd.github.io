HANNAH SIMPKIN. I am single, and live at No. 37, Cromer-street


. This pelisse hung in my room, which is on the first floor. On the 10th of February the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to the room, and asked for a lodging for her sister; I agreed to take her sister at 2s. a week; I saw the pelisse when she came in; she had told me to go to a house in Euston-square, to clean it; when I got there, I found it was all a trick; when I returned she was gone, and I missed the pelisse - I went out, and saw her crossing Skinner-street, and took it from her.

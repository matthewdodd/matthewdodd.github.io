            . I am a salesman
, and live in Oxford-street


. On the 15th of December, about half-past five o'clock, as I sat in the parlour, opposite the shop-door, I heard a noise at the door, as if something snapped. I went into the shop, missed the tray, and saw the prisoner running across the road with it - I followed him up Holles-street. He turned round, saw me, and threw it down - I took it to the office. He cut it down. He could not see how it was fastened without kneeling down, and going inside the shop. Another boy was with him, who got away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

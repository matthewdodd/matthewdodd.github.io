JOHN PARROTT
 was indicted

 for the wilful murder of 



Sarah Parrott.


MESSRS. BODKIN
and
CLERK
conducted the Prosecution.






JAMES EDE
. I am a labourer. In Dec. last, I lived at No. 6, Spicerstreet—the prisoner lived at No. 15, George-street—that is the same house as I lived in—there are two entrances; it is a double house; one entrance is in George-street, and the other in Spicer-street—I knew the prisoner and his wife for about five months—on 7th Dec, between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock, while I was in bed, I heard the deceased coming down stairs, going into the street—I was sufficiently well acquainted with their voices to know who was speaking—I heard the deceased make use of an awful expression, calling after the prisoner "a b—y image," and "Oh, you wretch," and so forth—between 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock, the same evening, I heard groans at the street door—my wife went from our room to the door—the prisoner was not there—my wife said something to the deceased—the prisoner was there then—I heard him ask his wife what was the matter with her—she replied, "You know best about that"—he said, "Get up stairs with you; I will do something to you for this to-morrow"—they then went up stairs to their room—they occupied a garret at the top of the house, not over my room, but at another part of the house—I did not see the deceased again alive.

Cross-examined by
MR. SLEIGH. Q. You had known the prisoner and his wife about five months? A. Yes; they lived on very unfriendly terms—I have heard their language when they were coming down stairs—I have not heard anything occur in their room, because I lived in a different part—I have not frequently heard the deceased abuse, and make use of foul language to her husband—I was not in the habit of associating with them—they might quarrel continually, without my knowing anything about it—I was not in the habit of going into their room—I do not know that the deceased was run over by a cart, in Fleet-street, some time ago, and brought home.





ANN MERRITT
. I am the wife of Joseph Merritt. I lived in the same house with the prisoner and deceased, in the room immediately under theirs—I have known them living in that room about six months—the prisoner is a jobbing butcher by trade; he used to carry meat about the streets—they lived together on very bad terms—I very often heard screams, and cries of "Murder!" from the deceased—I remember the day on which she was found dead—between 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock, that morning, I was in my own room in bed, and heard violent screams from the deceased, in their room—she was

screaming "Murder!"—the prisoner was in the room at that time—I heard his voice—he was abusing her, and swearing—calling her "a b—mare," and "a—blind b—"—I think she was partially blind—I got out of bed and went to the foot of the stairs, and called out to him, "You Parrott, what are you about with that poor creature"—in the confusion I could not catch his answer—he was abusing her—he muttered something which I did not hear distinctly—I then went into my room again, and while I was dressing he passed down the stairs, and went out—something was said about the police, but that was on his return—the screaming ceased while he was out—he returned between 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock—I was still in my own room—on his going into his room I heard the deceased screaming, "Murder!" violently again—I beard his voice swearing as before, and I heard a sort of scrambling and lumping noise, as though she had fallen—they were scuffling together first, and then there was a kind of lumping noise as though she fell—I did not go and call out to him then—I did between 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock—it was then that I spoke about the police—it was before he went out, when she said she was being murdered—I was then standing at the foot of the stairs, half undressed—I heard her say that—that was while he was there, and I said, "Oh, very well, as soon as I get my clothes on I will fetch the police to see what you are about"'—he replied "b—the police"—he went out after that, and before I was dressed—after the scuffle and fall I flew out of my room to go down stairs, but before I could get down, he passed down the stairs—that was about ten minutes after I heard the fall—during that ten minutes he was abusing her as before—I went out of my room door, and saw him pass down the stairs—I heard no noise or screaming after be had gone out—I did not see the deceased again; I was very near my confinement, and was not allowed to go into the room.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you know these people at all before they came to lodge in that house? A. No; I have heard the deceased name something about being run over in the streets of London, and taken home—I do not know it—I do not know that they were in the habit of drinking, I never saw them the worse for liquor—they were in very great poverty.





ELIZABETH BEER
. I am the wife of Frederick Beer, who is landlord of the house. No. 6, Spicer-street. The prisoner and deceased lived at our house for five or six months prior to the deceased's death—they occupied an attic—I remember 8th Dec, the day on which the woman was found dead in her room—in the early part of that day I heard great cries of "Murder!" in that room—they proceeded from the prisoner's wife—her name was Sarah Parrott—there was no one but her and her husband in the room at the time—I know he was there, because I saw him come down the stairs—I should say the cries continued about half an hoar, by what I could hear down stairs—I was in the down stair room—after the cries had gone on for some time I heard the prisoner come down, that was about 8 o'clock—I did not see him—the lodger in the one pair was abusing him for ill-using his wife—I did not hear him make any answer—I do not know what time he returned, I did not see him come in, but I saw him go out again about 10 o'clock, or it might be a little before 10 o'clock—he then had a hamper basket with him—before he went out at 10 o'clock, I had heard screams of "Murder!" a second time—I should say they continued about half an hour again—I did not see or hear anything of the deceased after he went out—the screams did not continue after he went out, I never heard a sound of her at all after that—no person went up to the prisoner's room after he went out.

COURT. Q. Can you say that nobody did go, or only that you do not

know of anybody going? A. I cannot say for certain that they did not, but I do not think they did.

MR. CLERK. Q. Were you at home daring the day? A. Yes; all the day—I saw the prisoner again a little after 5 o'clock in the evening, when be knocked at my room door, and asked me to come up stairs and see what was the matter with his old woman—I went with him to his room, and saw the deceased there—she was lying on an old straw mattress in one comer of the garret—I went up to her and felt her; she was quite dead—I said, "My God! Mr. Parrott, she is dead, she is stiff and cold, you must have done this this morning before you went out"—he said, "Why, God bless you, woman, she spoke to me two minutes ago"—I said, "I am sure it is false, for I am sure she has been dead for hours"—he said that he had said to her, "Sally get up and let's have some tea"—and that she said, "I do not know where I am"—he said he had only been in about two minutes, and had just set light to the fire—I should say from the appearance of the fire, that it had been lighted a long while—the coals were bright, and quite at the bottom of the stove—I said to him," This is the end of your fighting and quarrelling this morning, Mr. Parrott"—he said, "Why, woman, you are going mad"—the deceased was lying not quite upon her back, but very nearly; the right leg was quite straight—J remained in the room until the doctor came—the prisoner went for the doctor—he was told several times by different lodgers that came up into the room, to go for a doctor; but I should say it was about ten minutes before be went off—when I spoke to him about his wife's being dead, he made no other observation except that she had spoken to him about two minutes before.

Cross-examined. Q. These people were very poor? A. Very poor—I think the woman was kept very short—they had no furniture in their room, nothing at all except the old mattress; that old mattress was the only bed they had—I have several lodgers in the house—the deceased was very nearly blind—I do not know anything about her having been run over about a month before her death—while the prisoner was gone for Mr. Leech, I and one of the lodgers in the first floor remained in the room—neither of us moved the body or attempted to lift it up—I touched her when I first went up, but not after that—her eyes were half open, and the mouth likewise; she was not lying quite on her back, but very nearly, rather more on the left side: her head was leaning towards her chest, on the left side—the mattress was about six inches or a foot from the room; she was lying crossways upon the mattress; no part of her body was lying over the edge of it—there was a piece of patchwork quilt over her—I never heard the deceased say that she was subject to fits, and I do not believe she was; she was in a good state of health—I think she was a very healthy person, except in her sight; she was nearly blind, she could just discern the light—I never heard her say that she had been either run over, or bad fallen down in the street—I never saw them drunk.





ANN MERRITT

re-examined. I remained at home in my room from the time the prisoner went out till about 10 o'clock, when the body was found; I was not out at all—I heard no person go up to the deceased's room, or any noise whatever in the room, after he went out—there is only that one attic.





REBECCA MARY BEER
. I am the daughter of Mrs. Beer, who keeps the house. I remember the day on which Mrs. Parrott was found dead—about 10 o'clock that morning I heard the prisoner go down stairs; he went out into the street; just before that, I had heard Mrs. Parrott screaming dreadfully; she was hallooing, "Murder!" for some time—I heard no noise or

screaming after the prisoner went out—I did not see anybody go up stairs to the room after he went out, not until the body was found.





JAMES CHAPMAN
 (policeman, H 38), I apprehended the prisoner on 15th Dec, in Commercial-street, Spitalfields, a week after this occurrence took place—I said to him, "I shall take you into custody, fur being the cause of the death of your wife"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it;" I said, "I believe your name is John Parrott?"—he said, "You will find out quite different to that"—I said, "Well, I shall take you into custody, and chance it"—on our way to the station, I said, "It is no use for you to deny your name; you are well known in the neighbourhood, in the habit of hawking with oxtails"—he then looked at roe very hard, and said his name was Parrott, it was no use denying it—he said nothing more—this was after the inquest—I said to him, "It is a had job for you;" and he answered, "I have got over all that at the Inquest"

Cross-examined. Q. Did you attend the Inquest? A. I did not.





SAMUEL FOREST LEECH
. I am in practice as a surgeon, at No. 2, Hunt-street, Mile-end New-town. The prisoner came to my house on 8th Dec, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I was at home—he wished me to go and see his wife, as she was very ill; I asked him what was the matter with her—he said he did not know, he thought she was in a fit—I asked him if she was subject to fits—he said, yes, she had been subject to fits—I asked him if she had spoken to him lately—he said she had, about ten minutes before he came for me; I asked him what she bad said—he said, "I asked her to have a cup of tea, and her reply was that she did nut know where she was"—I then accompanied him to the room, and saw the body of his wife—in my judgment, she had been dead about three or four hours; the body was quite cold—I made no examination of the body then: she was partly upon her back, with her left leg drawn up, and the head bent down on the chest; the mouth was partly open the post mortem examination was afterwards made by Dr. Godfrey.

Cross-examined. Q. You say her mouth was open? A. Yes, and the eyelid was partly lifted—I did not examine the state of the pupil—I saw that she was dead, and I wished somebody else to be called in; Dr. Godfrey saw it; the mouth was drawn open about half an inch—I had a candle—I did not observe any lividity about the lips—I made a very superficial examination indeed at that time, finding that she was dead—Dr. Godfrey examined the body when he came, to see whether there were any marks of violence—I was present at the time; I never left the room at all—I observed no external marks of violence upon any part of the body; I did not myself examine the state of the pupil of the eye; I was with Dr. Godfrey when he did, and held the candle for him while he made the examination; as far as that goes, I participated in the examination—I did not take any notice of the state of the pupil of the eye, nor of the conjunctiva.





JOHN BLENNERHAST GODFREY, ESQ
. I am a physician, and also practise as a surgeon—I reside at No. 3, Mount-place, near the London Hospital. The prisoner came to my house on 8th Dec., about 6 o'clock—he Said, "Mr. Leech, the surgeon, has sent me to you, wishing you to come; my wife is very bad, she is dying, in fact, I believe she is dead"—I drove there directly—I got there about a few minutes past 6 o'clock—I found Mr. Leech in the room—I found the body of the deceased partly lying on a piece of mattress which came to about her hips, and her legs were on the floor—the body was almost naked: there was a small piece of rug, or something like hearthrug, or drugget over it, that was all the covering

she had; and it was a very small piece—she was lying with her head bent on the left tide, and her body slightly bent to the left side; her left leg was drawn up—the chest was bent towards the left side—her arms were lying by her side, I am not very distinct about their position it is only to the best of my belief—I stated at the time that in my judgment she had been dead about four or five hours; that was only conjecture; that is still my opinion; the body was cold except over the region of the heart—that was where the covering was—there was warmth there, amounting to the natural warmth—the body was rigid—the prisoner was there whilst I was examining the position of the body—I asked him, "Has this woman had any blows?"—he said, "No, she has not"—I made an examination of the body externally at that time—there was not one mark of external violence about it—there was no suffusion of the conjunctiva; the eyes did not protrude, they were slightly open; there was no red rim or mark round the eyes; nor any lividity of the lips—I made a post mortem examination on the Saturday following, the 11th—(I gave notice to the beadle at once, and the Coroner authorised me to open the body;) it was emaciated to an extraordinary degree; there were no scratches, or any marks of violence upon any part of the body externally—the stomach was small and contracted; the intestines were pale, empty, and attenuated, thinner than usual; all the fat which is generally, even in cases of disease, around the intestines, had been absorbed—the longs were out of their natural order; the left lung was compressed; it was congested and engorged with blood; it was full of black venous blood, unarterialised blood, and there were small congested patches in it as well—when I say congested, I mean red patches—the right lung was also engorged, and blacker than natural—on the front part of the liver, there was a bruised dark patch, about the size of the palm of the hand; over this patch, the peritoneal covering, which is a thin caul that covers the liver, was disattached from the liver—it was red, and there was some appearance of congestion about that portion—on removing the scalp, on the left side of the head there was a patch of coagulated blood, between the cellular tissue and the bone—it was blood coagulated in the vessels, forming a dark patch—I directed Mr. Leech's attention to that—and on examining the hair corresponding with that place, we found several of the hairs pulled out; the roots of the hairs were apparent; the hairs were not broken off, but pulled out by the roots; the hair was there, and the roots also—that was to some little extent immediately over the place where the coagulated blood was, and other parts near it—I looked at the external skin to see if there was any bruise, and also directed Mr. Leech's attention to that—there was no bruise—I then examined the interior of the head, the brain—the vessels were slightly engorged, although in a great number of bodies which I have opened at the hospitals, I have not seen the vessels so engorged in the majority of cases, yet I have seen cases of natural death where the vessels were as much engorged—the brain itself was healthy in its structure, and natural throughout—I examined the heart particularly—the right cavity contained dark blood, the left cavity was empty—I rather incline to think that the structure of the heart was more flaccid than usual, more weak and attenuated; whether that was from the absence of fat or not I cannot say—there was no structural disease in any part of the body.

Q. From all these appearances, what in your opinion was the cause of the woman's death? A. My opinion must be only taken as an opinion, and goes for no more than what you yourself would deduce from the facts, it only amounts to a probability, taking all the circumstances together, each of

which circumstances may depend upon some other cause, totally different from what I say—I merely give my opinion from rational ideas and notions; I am anxious that you should not attach to my judgment more value than it deserves—I am of opinion that from the emaciated state of the body, the woman was in an extremely weak condition; from the roots of the hair being pulled out, and the coagulated blood underneath that part, I am of opinion that she had received some violence by pulling her hair, and from the nature of that coagulated patch, and the appearances around it, I am of opinion that that took place during life—the congestion and compression of the lungs, and the compression of the chest, lead me to conjecture that her head had been pulled forward on her chest, and that from her weakened state, that caused her death, by stopping her breathing; if her head came in contact with the rug or mattress, in her weak and powerless state, life would become extinct—there is a disease called idiopathic asphyxia, which I have seen persons die of—that is a disease attacking persons from causes from within, without any external agent being perceptible to us—it is possible that she might from the state of her heart have had a tendency to idiopathic asphyxia and the pulling her head forward, in the manner I have described, might have caused an attack of this idiopathic asphyxia, and have caused her death; it would be different in her case—in the case of a strong person, youwould necessarily infer from the congested and compressed state of the lungs, that suffocation had taken place; that would have been my opinion, but looking at the weakened state of this woman, her spire and all her muscles being attenuated, that which in a strong person would require continued pressure to cause that strangulation, and those appearances, would in her case be effected in a very short time, by a single pull, perhaps—it is possible that a slight interruption of the breathing by pulling her forward, and her face coming in contact with the cloth or the bed, from the weakened state of her system, and the heart being flaccid, would have caused death in her, when it would not in a stronger person with out more continued pressure.

Q. You have stated two facts as to which probably the Jury may require some explanation; you say there was no redness round the pupil of the eye, and no lividity of the lips, what inference do you draw from that? A. In the majority of cases, it is the opinion of the profession, that suffocation is generally accompanied by lividity of the lips, suffusion of the conjunctiva, and general protrusion of the eye.

Q. How does the attenuated state of this woman's body, and the feeble condition of her system, in your opinion, bear upon the absence of those symptoms? A. That if pulled forward by her hair, and her head coming in contact with anything, that would be sufficient, in the state of her heart, to produce this strangulation, which it would not, in my opinion, in a stronger person.

COURT. Q. Do you mean to say, that you think a woman in her weak condition might be suffocated without causing lividity of the lips, or the ordi nary affection of the eye? A. Yes

MR. BODKIN. Q. Looking at the whole circumstances that you have described, in your judgment could the death of this woman have occurred from purely natural causes? A. I do not think it did occur from natural causes.

COURT. Q. From the appearances of the body, do you think she could have died a natural death? A. I do not think she could; the appearances were not consistent with a natural death, but it is possible—if I am confined to the post mortem appearances, I say it is possible she could have died a natural death.


MR. BODKIN. Q. Without any external violence at all? A. I do not think it is possible that those appearances I have described could have occurred without external violence—the appearances I saw could not have occurred from natural causes; finding those appearances I do not think she died a natural death.

Cross-examined. Q. I think the period which elapsed between the death of the deceased and the time of your making the post mortem examination, was about seventy-two hours, was it not? A. From the 8th to the 11th, it was sixty-nine hours after—the morbid appearances which would be exhibited upon a post mortem examination made immediately after death, sometimes differ from those presented after an interval of sixty-nine hours.

Q. If you had been called in to make this post mortem examination, without having heard anything whatever touching the antecedents of the case, would you, from that examination, have come to the conclusion that the woman had died a violent death? A. I do not know, it is difficult to answer that question, because it is mere conjecture—it is possible that I or any man might examine a body, and not having our attention particularly directed to any special circumstances, we might pass them over—I think the condition of the lungs would not have escaped any medical man accustomed to open bodies—asphxyia was the proximate cause of death, that is, engorgement and congestion with compression; it is possible that congestion of the lungs might be produced either by internal or external causes.

COURT. Q. Do you mean the congestion that you observed in this woman, or do you mean that congestion of the lungs might take place? A. The congestion as it was here; it is possible to have occurred without external violence, I mean from internal causes, from natural cause.

MR. SLEIGH. Q. From the idiopathic asphxyia? A. Yes; I do not think that it could have been produced by any internal disease, the result of which was pressure on the trachea, I cannot reconcile the possibility of pressure on the trachea—it is possible, but I cannot reconcile the probability in my own mind.

COURT. Q. Was there any symptom from which you could judge it possible to have arisen from that? A. No, nothing that I observed.

MR. SLEIGH. Q. At what portion of the body did you commence your incision for the purpose of opening the thorax? A. On the anterior superior portion of the chest, the upper and fourth portion—I examined the organs of respiration and deglutition, which are comprised in the larynx and pharynx—after making the external incision to remove the integuments, I raised the walls of the chest, and then from that I proceeded to examine the bronchia, the internal portion of the cells of the lungs; from that to the larynx, and then the musical box in the throat—I took out both the larynx and pharynx attached to the end of the lungs; I took it out attached to the end part of the trachea, I could not take it out attached to the fauces—I took it out downwards—I removed the trachea with the bronchial tubes, and passed my finger down to see that there was no foreign body in the dura mater—I made an examination of the larynx and pharynx, and I looked at the epiglottis particularly—I found no remnants of food in the mouth—I found the epiglottis lying on the rima glottidis, in its natural position—I examined the gall bladders; there was more bile in them than usual, but not any disease—I have met with cases of spasmodic action of the trachea—if death ensued from spasmodic action of the trachea, I should not be able, on a post mortem examination, to detect that any spasm had existed—the appearance of the lungs would be precisely analogous to the symptoms I have been describing.


Q. In point of fact, if this woman had died in consequence of a sudden spasm of that description, the appearances would have been precisely the same as those which you discovered? A. It is possible; but I do not apprehend that they would—I want to explain—in my opinion, if it had been from closure of the rima glottidis or any obstruction of that sort, and no pressure had been used, the left lung and the right lung would probably have been in the same condition; it is an opening common to both lungs.

Q. Then your theory of that pressure on the chest I apprehend is this, that the head was pressed down on the chest? A. The head was found so pressed down, and the chest might have been compressed, either from the body being pulled over, or from some pressure on the left side of the chest—the muscles of the neck and common integuments would not hare exhibited any marks of discolouration if, during life, the head had been forcibly drawn over on the chest—I saw a case where a man was pressed between a railway carriage and a wall on the Eastern Counties Railway, and there were no external marks, although the pressure was violent, and injured some of the internal organs, and this would be the case particularly with a thin woman, whose body was very much attenuated—the man I speak of did not die—I give that as a strong case—it is usual, if such violence has been exercised, to find some indications, such as ecchymosis or extravasation, on dissecting the common integuments and muscles of the neck—I dissected the common integuments and muscles of the neck of this woman on both sides—I laid back the flaps of the skin on both sides; not at the back, I examined the skin externally at the back—the muscles of the posterior and lateral portions of the neck arise, and are inserted from the base of the cranium to the clavicle and superior spinus processes—the trapezius is the strongest muscle in the neck—I examined those muscles externally, but a muscle presents no appearance unless it is ruptured—it is not at all probable that those muscles would have been ruptured if this violence had been exercised; I cannot even imagine it possible that the trapezius, or any muscle at the back of the neck, would have been ruptured.

Q. Are such morbid appearances as were presented upon post mortem examination here, frequently manifested in cases of death from natural causes? A. Such appearances have been manifested, at least some of them—you do Dot allude to the pulling out of the roots of the hair, of course.

Q. I am confining myself entirely to the internal appearances; I am afraid this unfortunate hair has created a prejudice in your mind? A. Perhaps it has; it is impossible to divest one's self of it to a certain extent—the appearance of the lungs was strongly analogous to that which is occasionally presented in cases of natural death, but rarely so, not frequently; it would be an exception—I do not pledge myself as to the actual cause of the death of this woman—the appearance of the lungs in cases of death from starvation, is not generally very similar to the appearances presented in this case.

MR. BODKIN. Q. My friend has asked you whether an interval of sixty or seventy hours might change the appearances upon which the examination proceeds; would that be the case here, with an attenuated person like this? A. No, it would not—I understood his question to be, "Do bodies generally change?" not with reference to this special case—in this particular case I do not think it did, because decomposition had not set in.

Q. You have been asked something about spasmodic action of the trachea; was there anything at all that indicated an attack of spasm? A. It is a

disease that leaves no post mortem appearances—there was nothing to lead me to the opinion that there had been any attack of spasm in the trachea—idiopathic asphyxia is a disease where a person will suddenly faint off, and for some want of power in the action of the heart the blood becomes coagulated or thickened—it is possible that having first met the left lung, and impeded respiration, the right lung may become gorged afterwards, from the exudation of hydrogen or some other cause, leaving the left lung compressed—I did not observe externally any appearance of pressure on the left lung—I observed that the chest was bent on the left side, and the bones of the sternum depressed on that side, as if flattened—I pointed it out to Mr. Leech, and he also pointed it out to me—I am of opinion that that depression was from some external cause—if a person in a struggle knelt on that part, that would account for it.

Q. With respect to idiopathic asphyxia, would your opinion of that disease arise in a case where you found the chest depressed, the lungs gorged, and the head leaning over in the way you have described this woman's head to have been? A. It would not.

COURT. Q. You speak of some coagulated blood under the place where the hair had been apparently pulled out; had that anything to do with causing the death? A. No—I think an attenuated body of this description would get cold sooner than a more robust one—the time in which a body loses heat differs exceedingly—it depends so much upon the surrounding temperature, that it is impossible to say; I have seen rigidity and coldness of the body arise in two hours; I have seen bodies remain warm eight or nine days, and I have seen rigidity without coldness come on almost immediately after death—it is uncertain—it may depend upon internal causes, the circulation, the vital warmth of the body itself, the state of heat retained in the flesh and fat, and it may depend upon the external temperature—a body exposed to a draught will cool sooner than one not so exposed—there was nothing either in the nature of this body or in the place where it was, to make me suppose that warmth would last longer than usual—indeed, I should think a very attenuated body, in a garret without a fire, in the month of Dec, and with no clothes on, would get cold sooner than in an ordinary case. Q. If the depression of the bone had taken place from any very recent violence, such as kneeling upon it, would it have been likely to leave any mark, the body being naked, or nearly so? A. It would be likely, in the generality of cases, I should say, but many cases to the contrary have occurred in my own experience, and it is laid down as a rule by medical men that great violence may be applied externally without leaving any mark at all; and on the other hand the least violence to some bodies will leave a very great mark—the thinness of the body would have something to do with it—cases have occurred of great pressure, such as pieces of rock falling upon a body and causing death, and upon examination there has not been a single sign of a mark externally, while the lung itself has been engorged and compressed—that would be more probable where a large surface was pressing upon it—the knee of a man would not be so likely to leave a mark as a blow, nor would a pressure—the general mark is from the vessels being ruptured from a blow; in that case it is an ecchymose mark—the least blow will cause a mark sometimes, when very great or violent pressure will not do so.

Before Mr. Baron Martin,

WILLIAM HAMBRIDGE
. I am a pork-butcher, and live in Liquorpond-street On the 30th of January, about ten minutes past six o'clock, I missed this pork—I made inquiries, and looked about as well as I could, but could not see it—the next morning the officer brought it, and I knew it was mine—I do not know the prisoner.





HENRY LING
 (police-constable E 83.) On the evening of the 30th of

January I saw the prisoner with something under his arm—I asked what he had got—he said a leg of pork, which he got from his master's at Ludgate-hill, and was going to Mrs. Downes in the Rookery—I took him, and the next morning found the prosecutor.




GUILTY

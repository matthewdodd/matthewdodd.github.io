 and 




ANN CONNOLLY



for feloniously receiving the said goods, well knowing them to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.






WILLIAM JOSEPH DIXON
. I am shopman to George Alexander Wood-row, hosier, Cheapside. On a Saturday evening in February, between six and seven o'clock, the two male prisoners came and asked me to show them some black silk handkerchiefs, which I did—there was a gentleman and lady in the shop at the time—I showed them some at 4s.—they said they wanted some better—I showed them one at 6s., and turned round to look for some at 5s., which they asked for—this is the 6s. one—I can swear to it—there was a dozen pairs of hose on the counter when they were there, which I missed when they left—these are them—I was asked for them shortly after the prisoners left, and missed them, and while I was looking for them the officer came in.






JAMES CUTHBERT
. I am inspector of the watch. About twenty minutes before seven o'clock, on the evening of the 25th of February, I was coming up Cheapside and saw the four prisoners and a girl, not in custody, come down Friday-street, all five together—one of the female prisoners, but I am notable to say which, lifted up an apron, and I saw a parcel pass from the one girl and two boys to the two female prisoners, who then went towards Watling-street—the two boys and the other girl walked up into Cheapside—I followed the two female prisoners, and in a minute or two I lost them—I found the two boys and the other girl in Cheapside—I traced them to Holborn-hill, where the two female prisoners were, and met Shaw—I took Connolly, and found the six pairs of stockings under her shawl—Shaw took Gullen, and I saw some stockings taken from her—I saw Shaw pick this handkerchief off the ground—I took the male prisoners next morning lurking about the Compter.





JOSEPH SHAW
. I am a policeman. I met Cuthbert last Saturday week, about a quarter to seven o'clock—I took Gullen into custody, and saw half a dozen pairs of stockings drop from under her shawl; and while Connolly was in custody of Cuthbert I saw this handkerchief drop from under her shawl, and I took it up.





GEORGE ALEXANDER WOODROW
. I am a hosier, in Cheapside. This handkerchief and stockings are my property.

Gullen's Defence. I was going up Friday-street, and met a young woman, who asked me to go with her—she gave me them to carry, and said she would pay me for my trouble—I know nothing of the boys.

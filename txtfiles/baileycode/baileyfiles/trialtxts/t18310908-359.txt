            . I am a journeyman carpenter
. I lost my saw from a house near the Royal Oak, at Bromley


, Middlesex, while I was at breakfast - the door had been secured by a prop against it inside; there could be no admittance but at the sash - I had been about five minutes in at breakfast, when a young man said he saw a man going out of the house, who came and inquired where we were -I went out, and took the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from there with my saw; I told him to give up the saw quietly, but he struck me, and was very violent - this is it.

            . I took the prisoner about eight years back, for stealing two saws and a rule - I had a certificate of his conviction, but have not brought it.

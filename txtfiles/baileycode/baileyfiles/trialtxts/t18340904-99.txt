            . I am the wife of John Sealey, of 69, West-street, Smithfield


 - the prisoner lodged in my house eleven or twelve times - we keep a lodging-house
 - on the 22nd of August the prisoner came to sleep there - he paid fourpence for the bed - he went to bed, and the next morning he came down just before eleven o'clock - I went to take my two children to school, leaving the prisoner in the yard washing himself - my shawl was on a box in the back room - I returned and missed it - I went after the prisoner, who had got to the bottom of Golden-lane, and overtook him - I charged him with stealing the shawl - he said he had not got it, and shuffled to get away - I called a witness, and then found the shawl at my feet - I have no doubt he dropped it, but I did not see him do so - this is my shawl.

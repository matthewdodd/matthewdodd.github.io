THOMAS ROBINSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Richard Crossley, from his person.






HENRY GILL
. I live in Churchill-street, St. Paneras. In the afternoon of the 9th of September, I saw the prisoner in Staples-inn, in company with another, following Mr. Crossley—I saw the other pick Mr. Crossley's

pocket of a handkerchief, and give it to the prisoner, who was walking by his side—he ran towards me—I called "Stop thief," and he was caught in Southampton-buildings, about five minutes' walk from the Inn—I saw him throw the handkerchief down in the road—I do not know who secured him, but he was secured—he ran through the Inn—I never lost sight of him—he was walking.





RICHARD CROSSLEY
. I live ib Holborn-bridge. Gill spoke to me, and I found my handkerchief was gone—this is it—It was given to me by a man who was holding the prisoner—I had not seen him secured—I was walking a contrary way into Holborn.





FREDERICK PRINCE
 (City-Policeman No. 79.) I took charge of the prisoner, and produce the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw the handkerchief on the ground and picked it up—the gentleman called "Stop thief" as I was walking along, and I chucked it down again—I had not seen any body take it from a pocket.
(Phœ be Millbert, Pleasant-place, King's cross, gave the prisoner a good character.)

LUCY BARNARD
. My husband's name is James, he is a printer. On the 11th May, between three and four in the afternoon, I was on Holborn-hill, felt something at my pocket, I put my hand down, and caught hold of the prisoner's arm—his hand was in my pocket—I missed my handkerchief and a small parcel—the handkerchief was found on him, and the parcel was lying on the pavement, close to him—it contained a handkerchief, collar, and reel of cotton—these are them, they are my property.






DAVID HEWETT
, (policeman.) I took the prisoner into custody, and found the handkerchief under his coat.

Prisoner's Defence. It was not me that put my hand into her pocket; I picked the things up on the pavement.





SAMUEL FORSAY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted January 1847, and confined one day)—I was present at the trial—he is the boy.

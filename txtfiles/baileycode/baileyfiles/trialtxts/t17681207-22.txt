            . I am a taylor and salesman
. The prisoner came to live with me a servant
, the latter end of August; he was with me about 13 weeks; in that time, he took several of my goods. Missing some on the 26th of November, I charged the prisoner with taking them; he denied it. I enquired at the pawnbrokers, and at Mr. Humphry's, in West-Street, Seven-Dials, where I found a waistcoat, a coat, a pair of black stocking-breeches: some I found at Mr. Bibby's, and some at M r. Fryer's, pawnbrokers.
The several things produced by the pawnbrokers, pawned by the prisoner, and deposed to by prosecutor.
The prisoner, in his defence, said, he was in necessity; he did make use of them, but intended to get them again as soon as possible.



               Guilty

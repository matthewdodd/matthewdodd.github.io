            . I live at the duchess of Bolton's, I am a single woman.
Q. Did you lose a coat and umbrella in January last - A. Yes; on the 14th, about the middle of the day, they were taken out of the servant's hall; I had seen them about an hour before.

                  RICHARDSON
               



            . I am porter to her grace the duchess of Bolton; I saw the prisoner on the 14th of January last coming up the outer steps with this letter in his hand.
Q. He was coming out of the house was he - A. Yes; I called to him twice to know his business; what he had been about; he had got the things concealed upon him at the time; I then went and stopped him and asked him what was his business; he told me he wanted a Mr. 
               
                  Charles 
                  Moore
               



            ; he had a letter in his hand directed to 
               
                  Charles 
                  Moore
               



            ; I told him he went a very improper way to find Mr. 
               
                  Charles 
                  Moore
               



            ; I advised him to knock at the front door and the porter would be the proper person to ask; he went away, I did not see the things at the time till he went away, then I saw through the hind skirt of his coat the end of the umbrella; I went down stairs and asked my fellow servant if she had seen a man in the house; she said she had not. I pursued the prisoner and took him in Charles street, Grosvenor square, turning into a mews with a great coat and an umbrella on him; I took him him to the watchhouse; I delivered up the property to the beadle.
The property produced and identified.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work six weeks; I was seeking for work. On Saturday morning I found this letter, it was directed to 
               
                  Charles 
                  Moore
               



            ; I thought if I found the owner of this letter I should get something; the letter was directed to Portman squre; I was directed to Grosvenor square, and there they told me they thought it was four or five houses off; I went down the area steps; being out of work I was guilty of this; I saw the door open; I saw nobody there, which was the occasion of my taking them.

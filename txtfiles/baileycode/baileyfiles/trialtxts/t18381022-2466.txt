SAMUEL SLOANE
. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery. On the 19th of October I hung my watch at the head of my bed, at Woolwich—in the morning it was gone—the prisoner and others slept in the same room—this is my watch—(looking at it.)

Primer. Q. Was I in the room when you went to bed? A. I did not see you—I got up at five o'clock.

Prisoner. I was out on leave on Friday night, and I was in bed when he got up the next morning, and when he came back.

Primer. It was given to me by a person in the street—I was in liquor.

Witness. No, he was not.




GUILTY of Stealing, but not from the person. Aged 32.

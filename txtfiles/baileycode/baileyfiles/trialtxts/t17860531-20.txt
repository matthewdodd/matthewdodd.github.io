                   DAVIS
               



             sworn.
I am a shoemaker
; I lodge at one Mr. Walker's; I have part of a shop with Mr. 
               
                  Joseph
                   Walker
               



            ; the shop is under the same roof of the house, my shop goes into Mr. Walker's shop, and from thence into the bed room, the door is towards the street; I left my shop on the 19th of May, about half past eight in the evening; I fastened the door very secure, when I left it, I locked it on the outside, and put the key in my pocket; I bolted the inside, and went through Mr. Walker's shop which has a door to the street; I took this shop by the week; I have only one window fronting the road, that I fastened by a bar across the window on the outside, and a pin and key to it; I was there the next morning, a little before five; when I went in the shop, I found the wall in the back part of the shop towards the yard was broke down; there was a hole, about two feet long; the wall was brick, and some wood; I missed a quantity of shoes, and all my tools, except two hammers; I called Mr. Walker, and we went to Kingsland-road, to people in the same branch of business; and one 
               
                  Margaret
                   Jones
               



             sent me word, and we went and saw a house where they told us the person went into, in Three-cup-alley, Shoreditch; I walked by the door, and saw two of the prisoners talking in the entry together; that was the woman and the prisoner Goff; we got two of Mr. Wilmot's runners, and shewed them the house; we went into the house, and there were two little girls below stairs; and they asked the little girl where the shoes were the man had got to sell; and I saw two pair of my shoes there; the girl said to Armstrong, the shoes that my mammy has to sell are up stairs; we went up stairs, and found part of the property in the room, and the three men prisoners there; one of the officers handcuffed two of the prisoners; we searched them, and on the prisoner Wood we found the watch-chains; the woman was not with them at this time; there were found twenty-eight pair of shoes, besides leather, and other articles.


                  JOHN
                   ARMSTRONG
               



             sworn.
I am an officer in Shoreditch parish, where the prosecutor lives; I met him about seven in the morning; he told me his misfortune, and that Mrs. Jones had described the prisoner 
               
                  Susannah
                   Humphrys
               



             to him; I told him to watch the woman, as we were known; I stood at the corner of Three-cup-alley; then I went into the house, I did not see the woman there; I saw some shoes in a box, and the prisoner Wood was looking over them, the other two prisoners were sitting in a chair by the fire-side; I immediately desired them all to come up; they all came up, and we secured the three men prisoners; here are the shoes that we found there, there are twenty-eight shoes.
Prosecutor. Here are fourteen pair of old shoes.
What are these fourteen pair of old shoes worth? - They are not worth twenty shillings; I buy them, and mend them up for sale.


                  MARGARET
                   JONES
               



             sworn.
I keep a broker's shop, I sell old clothes and old shoes; on Saturday morning, which I believe was the 20th of May, a woman, the prisoner, came to me, between seven and eight, with some old shoes to sell; I told her they did not suit me; she carried them away.


                  SARAH
                   BELLA
               



             sworn.
I am landlady of this house in Three-cup-alley; I let the apartment to the woman prisoner; she lodged there a fortnight and two or three days; I was not at home when the officers came in.


                  JOSEPH
                   WALKER
               



             sworn.
Mr. Davis lives in my house; I occupied Davis's house before I let it, it is a part of my shop, I frequently go out at Davis's door; I and my family went to the house; I lost four watch-chains, they were hanging upon a string which Mr. Davis put up to hang his old shoes on; they hung in Davis's shop, they were steel chains, value about sixpence; they were rusty; I heard no noise in the house till Mr. Davis came; I went up stairs, and I found Wood and Peter the black man, and Goff; they were sitting by the fire; I cannot say they were doing any thing; I think Goff was trying a pair of shoes.
What was Wood about? - Sitting still, I think.
Who took up the woman?
Armstrong. I took her in Shoreditch, in company with the landlady, on the information of the man; I found nothing on the woman prisoner.
Prisoner Goff. I was not trying on any shoes.

Armstrong. The prisoner Goff was in the chair by the fire-side, and so was Peter; it was Wood that was by the chaff-box, looking over the shoes.


                  JOHN
                   HARPER
               



             sworn.
I went up after them; I took the chains out of a cupboard in Goff's room, that was over the door; and there was this basket, with these tools and a pair of shoes in it; that was the room where he and the woman lived.
Prisoner Goff. I do not rent the room, I know nothing of the room.
(The things deposed to.)

            . Did you ever see any of the other prisoners come backwards and forwards? - Yes, many times, all three; I have seen the prisoner Goff lay on the bed early in the morning.
PRISONER GOFF'S DEFENCE.
This young woman has washed for me some time; I went there backwards and forwards for my linen; I met her over night, and told her I wanted a clean shirt; she bid me come in the morning, and when I was going, I met her; she said she was going of an errand, and bid me go up stairs, and wait for her; I went up; here is a young man here that knows I had not been there five minutes.
PRISONER WOOD'S DEFENCE.
I took these things up into the room; I got up in the morning, and I went to take a drink at the pump, and I found these things laying at the pump.
 PETER the black man's DEFENCE.
I have nothing to say; I was going to look for a man for my master; I am a labourer
.
PRISONER HUMPHRYS'S DEFENCE.
I was not the person that carried them; and Mrs. Jones would not have sworn against me, if the Justice had not made her.
Court to Jones. Did not you swear positively against this woman? - I did swear; but I was not willing to be in trouble, because I could not leave my house and family.

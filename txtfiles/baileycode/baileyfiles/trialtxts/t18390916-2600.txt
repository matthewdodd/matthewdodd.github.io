MARY KING
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
25th of August, 1 pewter-pot, value 10d., the goods of 



Thomas Weal; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD DEDDERIDGE
. I am barman to Thomas Weal, who keeps the Duke of Bedford public-house, Golden-lane. On Friday night, the 25th of August, the prisoner came, and had a pint of beer about half-past seven o'clock—she sat there till near ten o'clock, and a little boy who is here, came and gave me information—I went out, but could not find the prisoner—she came to the house again next morning, and had some rum, and went out, there being no policeman handy to take her—we shortly after heard she was in custody—we missed a pot the evening she was there, which we have not found.





CAROLINE GROGAN
. I went to the public-house on Sunday evening, the 25th of August, for one of my children—the prisoner came from the bar, and sat by me with her beer—she drank it, got up, concealed the pot under her shawl, and went out—I went and told the barman, and a man ran after her, but did not see her—next day I saw her at the station-house—I am certain I saw her conceal it—the prisoner said at the office that I should have a guard after me, I should suffer for it—on Saturday night I was carrying a few articles, and received a blow—I am in danger of my life.





JOHN HAYWARD
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person who was then tried and convicted.

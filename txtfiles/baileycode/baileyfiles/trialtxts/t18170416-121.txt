            . We keep the George, in Baron-row, Chelsea




. On the 22d of February, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner and another man came with a bag, which appeared to have hay in it. They went into the parlour, and had some ale and gin. They left about half-past four. The bag then appeared to be full. I went to my cupboard, in the parlour, which was kept locked, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. The prisoner carried the bag. I went out, and saw them walking together about thirty yards off. I sent Brown after them, and he brought the prisoner back with the bag, which contained my things. He had two wine glasses in his hat, and two in his pocket.

WILLIAM LEE
. I am a Colchester carrier, and drive for Messrs, Joseph parch and Richard Stanbridge—on the 27th of February, I had a carboy slung on to the hind part of the waggon, with a rope to each handle, at the India Arms, Lime-street—it was safe when I started at half-past nine o'clock to go to Brentwood—it was tightly secured—it must have been cut off when we got as far as Mr. Charington's brewhouse, Mile-end-road—it was then gone—I looked at the cords, and they had been cut—it was safe when I got to Mlle-end-turnpike—I missed it at the brew-house—I stopped, but did not know what to do, and went on.





WILLIAM COOPER
. I am employed by Mr. Henry Beaufoy, a maker of vinegar and sweats. I am the acetic acid warehouseman—I made this, and gave it to our carman to go to the India Arms—it was to go to Colchester for John Smith—this is the carboy.





JAMES DUNGATE
. I am porter to Mr. Beaufoy—I took the carboy to the India Arms, and delivered it to the book-keeper, to go to Mr. Smith, of Colchester.

JAMES MULLINS
 (police-constable K 66.) On the 27th I saw the prisoner in Whitechapel, about 100 yards on this side the Mils-end turnpike—he was going into another street, with the carboy on the shoulder—the street was narrow—there was a whistle at the place where he turned from—he threw this, and ran away—I pursued and took him—he fell down, and them he said he had picked it up—I had not my uniform on, but I was well known, as I have been on officer there upwards of six years.

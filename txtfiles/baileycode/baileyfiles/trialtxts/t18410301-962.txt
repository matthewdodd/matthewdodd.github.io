JOHN KNIGHT
. I am shopman to Griffith Humphreys, of Oxford-street. On the 26th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, Dell came to the shop for a pair of socks—I showed him some—he wanted me to look for some more—Collard then came in, and stood by the side of him—they did not appear to know each other—they did not speak—Collard did not ask for any thing—while I was turning to get the other socks, Collard took the handkerchief off the counter—I caught hold of both of them, and kept them in the shop till the policeman came—I saw this handkerchief drop from under Collard's coat.

THOMAS TKINGJIAM (police-constable E 18.) I have frequently seen the prisoners together—I know that they know each other—I think I saw them together the day before this.

WILLIAM CUMMINOS (police-sergeant D 13.) I took the prisoners and received this handkerchief—Dell said, "I know nothing of the other person; I was in the shop before he came in."

Collards Defence. I went in for a stock to put inside my handkerchief.

Delll's Defence. I was at home all day on the 25th; I was taken on the 26th.






WILLIAM CUMMINGS
 (police-sergeant D 13.) I produce a certificate of Collard's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person who was convicted.

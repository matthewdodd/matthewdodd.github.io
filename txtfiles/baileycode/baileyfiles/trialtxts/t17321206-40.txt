                  Stephen 
                  Freeman 
               



            . I had a Judge's Warrant against 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             for assaulting me, and threatning to fire my House. My Wife and I had been hunting up and down for her, and at last, between 8 and 9 at Night, we met her at the End of Sheer Lane by Temple Bar. Says I to my Wife, there's 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             ; Gale turned short, and said, what do you want with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



            ? and so went into a 
               
                  Gin 
                  Shop 
               



             kept by one Jones. I sent my Wife with the Warrant to get a Constable. Then the Gang that uses that House set upon me, and tore me and hal'd me about like mad; I warrant you there was twenty or thirty of them seiz'd me. You Rogue, says one, and you Dog, says the other, I'll do this, and I'll do that. Then I saw 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             take 15 s. four Pence halfpenny out of my Pocket, and give it to 
               
                  Nel 
                  Walker 
               



            , and went away. Then I seized Gale, and said, you shan't go now, till I get a Constable for you. And upon that all the Gang fell abroad on me again, and got her away directly, but my Wife took her in about a quarter of an Hour after, by the Judge's Warrant. I got a Warrant next Day from Justice Newton, and took Walker.
Gale. Did you mention the Robbery that Night? Freeman. Yes.



                  Ann 
                  Freeman 
               



            . We met Gale as she was turning up Sheer Lane. Says I to my Husband, Stephen! there's 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



            ! She turned back and said, what do you want with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



            ? so she went into a Brandy Shop, and my Husband sent me with the Warrant, and when I came back, there was a great Uproar, and she run away; and a Boy told me, that the Woman that had beat and robb'd my Husband was run up Stairs into 
               
                  Peter 
                  Wattle 
               



            's Coffee-house.
Gale. Freeman met me, and said, Mrs. Gale, I have a Judge's Warrant. Where is your Tip-staff, says I, to serve it? I have none, says he. Where's your Constable then? says I. Why, says he, I am one; and with that he pull'd out a Constable's Staff. You a Constable! says I, how came they to make a Foot Soldier a Constable? so went in to drink at Mrs. Jones's, and had a Quartern of Liquor; and he was so far from losing 15 s. that he had not enough to pay the Reckoning; for when Mrs. Jones asked him for the Money, he said he could not pay till his Wife came, and she afterwards paid for it. He took me into a Tipstaff's House, and he and his Wife-tore my Gown off my Back, and tumbled me in the Dirt ; and he did not charge me with the Robbery till 5 Days after I was committed.
Then the Copy of the Warrant for her Commitment was read. It was for an Assault, without any mention of a Felony, and dated November 6.
Freeman. I was robb'd on the second of November, and changed her on the third.
Court. It's a little strange, that you who was robb'd on the second, and got a Warrant on the sixth, should say nothing then of this Robbery, but only charge her with an Assault.


                  Kate 
                  Buck 
               



            . He charged me and my Sister with the same Fact.
Court. What Business do you follow?
Kate. I keep a public House in Fleet Lane ; 'tis a Brandy Shop.
Freeman. She keeps no House, she's a common Night-walker.
Constable. I executed Alderman Billers's Warrant on 
               
                  Kate 
                  Buck 
               



             for the same Robbery.
Then the Warrant was read. It was for apprehending 
               
                  Ann 
                  Buck 
               



             alias Pearse, alias Lewin, and 
               
                  Katherine 
                  Buck 
               



             alias Pember, o't Suspicion of being concern'd with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             and 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Walker 
               



             in stealing 15 s. from 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Freeman 
               



            .
Court. It was not for your Credit to produce this Warrant [to 
               
                  Kate 
                  Buck

            . I was at the Castle Alehouse in Sheer Lane, when Freeman brought in Gale, and several more of these Women came with them. There was a great Disturbance and Confusion. I understood he had first carried her to Mr. Davis's, who would not take Charge of her, because she was not brought by a proper Officer. Freeman said he had a Judge's Warrant against her for an Assault, but I heard him make no mention of a Robbery. And he having no Authority to detain her, she made her Escape by the help of the Woman who came with her. 
               
                  Kate 
                  Buck 
               



            , she in the red short Cloak there, and her Sister, and the Prisoners too, are pretty well known in this Court.


                  Nan 
                  Pearse 
               



            . Without I am to tell the whole Story from Beginning to Ending, I won't say a word.
Court. Have not you another Name?
Pearse. Yes, I have had two Husbands, the first is dead, and his Name was Pearse, and I am Buck's Sister. Nay, you shan't catch me in a Lie; I ow'd Mrs. Jones, the Woman that keeps the Chandler's Shop, 7 s. 6 d. and so -
Court. What do you know of the Prisoners?
Pearse. Freeman brought 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             into the Shop; he would have had her to a Tavern; but says she to him, there has been a great Demur betwixt us, because my Husband keeps that Whore 
               
                  Nan 
                  Parrot 
               



             in your House, and therefore I won't go with you: And so he called for a Quartern.
Court. Do you know any thing of the Robbery?
Pearse. No, but only he charged me with it, and I was discharged by Alderman Billers.
- Thorp. Freeman and his Wife came to my House (the Ship Alehouse in the Old Bailey) and desired me to go with them to look for Gale. We went to Wind-mill-hill, and from thence to Gale's Sister's in Shoe Lane, where we drank to the Tune of half a Crown, and then we and two others went to the Hay-market, and mist of her there to. But coming back by the End of Sheer-Lane, his Wife called to him, and said, Freeman, here the Bitch is. He came up, and damn you, you Bitch, says he, I have catch'd you now. He had but 15 d. when he went out, and he spent 4 d. at the White-Lion in the Old-Bailey; and when we came to Gale's Sister's, his Wife paid 2s. of the Reckoning, because he had not enough to pay the Whole. And as he was going home, I ask'd his Wife if he had lost 15 s. Damn him, a Son of a Bitch, says she, who would trust him with 15 s. to get drunk with?
Mrs. Wattle. I keep a Coffee-house in Ship-yard by Temple Bar. I was above Stairs when Gale came running up, and shut me in, and cry'd, for God-sake hide me. I was frighted. The Constable, and Freeman and his Wife followed. I ask'd 'em what was the Matter, and if she had robb'd 'em? and Mrs. Freeman said no.
Several other Witnesses swore that Freeman kept a vile House in White-Fryars ; that he said he knew nothing of the Robbery till next Day; and that he offered to make it up for 10 Guineas.
Freeman swore it was all false, and that they offered him 10 Guineas to make it up. The Jury found the Prisoners 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d. each
            .

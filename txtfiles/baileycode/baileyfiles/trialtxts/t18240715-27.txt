            . I am a hat manufacturer
, and live in Great Surrey-street, Blackfriars


. The prisoner was my porter
. On Monday the 14th of June a parcel was shewn to me on the desk of my counting-house, it contained a piece of broad cloth, which was mine, tied up in a handkerchief; it had been in a room above stairs, to which the prisoner had access. I told my shop-man to take it back again to where he found it, and I saw him do so. On the 22d of June I was at Mr. Perring's, in the Strand; the prisoner came there with something he was to bring - he was ushered in by my orders, and I asked him who were the boys he had been with on the road coming along; he had his hat in his hand, and I saw something in it - I asked what it was; he said his handkerchief. I found it to be the cloth which had been shewn me - he said it was a waistcoat which he had bought of a Jew in Union-street. I opened the cloth, and said,
"Is this a waistcoat?" He then said he intended it to be one. I had given him no orders to take it.

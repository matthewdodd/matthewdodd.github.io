            . On the 7th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was crossing Red-lion-street


 - a person pointed the prisoner out to me as having picked my pocket - I ran, and secured him. He said, "pray, sir, let me go - I will give it you." I pulled my pocket-book out of his breeches-it contained the property stated in the indictment.

            . I am a grocer, and live in Red-lion-street. I was looking through my window, and saw the prisoner and another man walking behind Mr. Lane. The prisoner held Mr. Lane's coat-pocket with one hand, and took the pocket-book with the other. I pointed him out to Mr. Lane, and he secured him. The prisoner gave him the book again.

            . On the 14th of July, about nine in the evening, I was going along Cornhill


, coming from White-chapel to the west end of the town, I felt something touch against my thigh; I looked round and saw the prisoner at the bar with his hand in my right hand pocket; he pulled it out as soon as I looked at him; he threw it from his left hand to his right; there was a woman on his right hand, that I believe received it. I catched hold of his Collar, and never let him go till I got him to the compter. I am sure it is the boy.
Q. from the Prisoner. Why did not you stop the woman?
Hollaway. I spoke to a woman in a crowd and said I believe you have my handkerchief; she pulled out a blue and white handkerchief, and said, you rascal, is this your handkerchief; and being a croud the woman got away.
Prisoner's Defence.
I go about with hardware, and sometimes with lemons. I am eleven years old. The gentleman laid hold of my collar, he was very much in liquor, and said I had got his handkerchief, and he dragged me to Wood street compter. I know nothing of it.
Prosecutor. I was as sober as I am now.

Thomas Hashfield thus depos'd. The Prisoner was a Chair-Woman
 in my House, and used to come once in two or three Weeks. And one Day she was sent up Stairs for a pair of Stockings, and (as she afterwards confest ) she open'd the Drawer, and took out the Goods. - Now, it so fell out that in a Day or two after, we had a Loin of Veal for Dinner, and my Wife sent the Maid up for a Silver Spoon, but down she came again, and said there was none there, and then my Wife ran up, and mist the Ring; upon which we got a Warrant to search the Prisoner's Lodging, and we found the Thousand of Pins in her Bed, and the 2 Spoons, and some of the Linnen, and a Key, that upon Tryal would open all our Drawers. - She confest that she had sold two of the Rings to Mrs. Ridley, a Goldsmith, near King Edward's Stairs, in Wapping; we went thither, but Mrs. Ridley said, we should not search her House, no, not if we had my Lord Chancellor's Warrant. Several Witnesses depos'd, That the Prisoner had hitherto born the Character of an honest, industrious Woman, but the Fact being plainly proved against her, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

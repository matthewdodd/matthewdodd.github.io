MARY ANN DENENLAIN
. I am the wife of John Joseph Dominique Denenlain; he keeps a boarding-house in Leicester-square. These shirts are the property of a gentleman who lodged in the house, and this great-coat is my husband's—I saw them safe on the evening of the 22nd. of April—the shirts, with various other articles, were in a bundle ready for the washer-woman about nine o'clock in the evening, and the great-coat was hanging by their side—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to the house to work as a tailor, and had an opportunity of taking the things—I missed them about two minutes after I had seen them safe.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHAMBERS. Q. How do you know these

sirts? A. By the marks, and having taken notice of them, and having the gentleman's name in our books—I saw them in the bundle, and took notice of them, and the manner in which they were marked—there were three shirts, one pair of trowsers, and some handkerchiefs in the bundle—these shirts have the name of Edward Morton written at length on them.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the prisoner at the house that night? A. I do not know—he was not there on any business.





ABRAHAM FLETCHER
. I am an officer. On the 17th of August I went to No. 73, Compton-street, with the other officers—while I was in the second floor front room the prisoner came in—in searching the room I found these shirts, this great-coat, and this other coat, which the prosecutor identifies as the one which the prisoner wore when he came to their house.





WILLIAM GREVILLE OLIVIER

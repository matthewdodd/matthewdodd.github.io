            ; I live with my father, Hugh Parsons - I have the care of some ready-furnished lodgings of his in Blue-anchor yard, Whitechapel


. The prisoner and a person named Harris hired a lodging; the sheets and quilt were let with the room - they remained there from December till the 15th of May; I then locked them out of the room, in consequence of the bad behaviour of the man; they got in at the window and the man threw all the things out of the window; I went there - he was so violent I gave charge of him: he was imprisoned for a month. The prisoner gave up the duplicates of these things, and was committed for trial; they owed me 16s. or 17s.

SARAH EVANS
. I am the wife of David Evans. The prisoner lodged at my house—he went away, and I found his door locked—we went in at the window, and missed the sheets and table-cloth—these are them.





ROBERT BOYCE
. I am assistant to Mr. Hardy, a pawnbroker—these things were pawned by the prisoner—the sheet on the 29th of June, and the other things at different times.

Prisoner's Defence. I was taken ill; I expected a remittance from my wife, who has deserted me and left me destitute of everything.




GUILTY
.* Aged 41.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

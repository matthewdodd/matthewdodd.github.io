BENJAMIN BRANSGROVE. On the 1st of this month I left two waistcoats and a pair of trousers in my room, at No. 2, Market-street, Bloomsbury-square


 - I went out about six o'clock in the evening, and stopped till nine - I did not discover that they were gone till the morning following; I shut up the shop myself at ten; the prisoner worked for me that day - he was there when I left at six o'clock. On the Tuesday in the next week I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, and part, if not all the property, was found under the bed - a bundle of duplicates dropped out, part of which related to my property; one of the waistcoats had been made for sale - the other was bespoken; the prisoner worked by the piece - these garments are the same that were taken away - he had worked for me two months.

            . I am an officer, and went to the prisoner's house; he told me where he lodged - I turned the bed down, and found a waistcoat under it - I saw the duplicates relating to the waistcoats and trousers, pledged for 15s.; I told him I had found out where the things were - he said, "I cannot help it."

            . These trousers were pledged with me on the evening of the 1st of February, and I gave this duplicate to the person. I am in the employ of Hedges and Co., of Drury-lane.

WILLIAM WIGGINS. I was at the corner of Fleet-street


, about nine o'clock in the evening, on the 26th of July; I felt something at my pocket, and turned round; the officer called out, "You are robbed;" I turned, and detected the two prisoners close to my coat - Bresney had my handkerchief under his jacket.
THOMAS PROTHERO (City Policeman No. 61.) I was coming into Fleet-street, and saw Howling take hold of the prosecutor's coat, and in an instant the handkerchief was handed to the other prisoner - I took them; they both had hold of it.
RICHARD BARRETT. I was present, and saw what Prothero has stated.
Howling's Defence. The gentleman says that Bresney took it, and the officer says I took it - they do not know who took it, for neither of us took it.

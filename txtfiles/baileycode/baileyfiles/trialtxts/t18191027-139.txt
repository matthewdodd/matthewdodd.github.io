. My decanters stood on the counter in the shop. On the 27th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, while I was at breakfast, a neighbour came in and alarmed me - I missed the decanters; he directed me down Compton-street; I went out, and found the prisoner in White Lion-court with them.

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I saw two boys standing at the door, peeping; soon after I saw them pass my shop with the decanters; I alarmed Hughes, and told him which way the boys went - they secured the prisoner with the decanters. He stood at the door, waiting for the little boy to come out.

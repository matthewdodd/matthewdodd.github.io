On the 1st of April, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in the London road, coming from towards Mr. Cook's; Hollis had an empty sack on his back, and Johnson had a bag with the rabbits. I detained them, and took them to the cage. They said they were given to them in town to carry to Johnson's master, at Chertsey.

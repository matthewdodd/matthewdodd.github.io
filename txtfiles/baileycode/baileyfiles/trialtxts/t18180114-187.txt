            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Jermyn-street, St. James's. I was going through Hemmings-row


, on the 15th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner, and another man, run by me, I put my hand to my pocket,and missed my pocket-book; I immediately pursed, they turned round, saw me, and ran much faster-as the prisoner ran I saw him put the pocket-book down his bosom - He was stopped before he got out of my sight. He immediately pulled the pocket-book from his side-pocket, and tried to throw it down an area, but the railing stopped it; I picked it up, and gave him in charge.

            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 7th of March I met the prisoner at Limehouse, near the Regent's-basin, about a mile from the prosecutor's - he was carrying a basket; I asked what he had got in it - he said he was going to market; I found in it this brass cap, weighing 23lbs. - I asked where he brought it from; he said from Hope-lane, Limehouse, and it was his own.

            . I am an engineer
. This is my cap, and was taken from my back yard; it is worth about 5l. to me - the prisoner has worked for me: I once had occasion to give him a caution.
Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What is the worth in the market? A. It is worth 1s. 4d. per lb. as old brass; the prisoner had been in my service for some months: here is no mark on this cap, but I have the model from which it was cast; other persons never cast from the same model.

            . I was going through Covent-garden market. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner walking very close behind him - I heard the prosecutor cry Stop thief! I turned round, and the prisoner passed me - I made an attempt to catch him, but missed him; I saw the pocket-book then in his hand - he stooped down, and threw it into a cellar; I saw it handed up very shortly afterwards, and the prosecutor claimed it.
Prisoner. I leave it to the Jury.

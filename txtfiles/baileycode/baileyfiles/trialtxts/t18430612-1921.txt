SAMUEL THOMAS SUTTON
. On Sunday, the 4th of June, I was passing down Shadwell—the prisoner followed me—I felt my pocket move—I turned, and collared the prisoner—he had my handkerchief in his right hand, and was putting it into his pocket—directly I took him, his friends got up, and get him from me—he went round the corner—the policeman seized him, and he was taken—I had laid hold of him—my handkerchief was hardly out of my pocket—he begged of me to let him go—he put it up to his left-breast pocket—I pulled it from his hand.

Prisoner. I had no pocket, I could not put it in.





JOHN COOPER
. I am a fisherman, and live at Barking. I was with Sutton—I saw him collar the prisoner, and take the handkerchief out of his hand.





GEORGE PAVITT
 (police-constable K 260.) I heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running, and caught him.

Prisoner. I saw it on the ground, and took it up—the prosecutor turned—I said, "Here is your handkerchief"—I said, "There he goes"—I pointed to a man running.

The prosecutor keeps the Half-moon tavern, Cheapside




; he saw the prisoner rolling a mountain butt out of his yard; he sent a servant after him. The prisoner told that servant, that he was going with it to Mr. Andrews's wine-vaults in Crutched-friars. The prisoner rolled it down Cheapside to Bow-lane, where he enquired for one Jones, who was removed. Then the prosecutor's men charged him with having stole the butt, and desired him to go back to his master's, which the prisoner refused.
The prisoner, in his defence, said, that a man gave him the butt, and bid him roll it to Mr. Jones's in Crutched-friars. He called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

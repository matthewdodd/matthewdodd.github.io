            . I live in Baldwin-street


, St. Luke's, and am a shoemaker
. On the 5th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise - it was then quite dark - I was on the first floor at the time. I came down stairs, the street-door was fast, and I heard a noise in the room, which induced me to go in. The prisoner was in the room. I said,
"Who are you?" he then jumped out of the window into the street.
Q. Had you left the window close - A. Yes. I then ran after the other; he had not the property when I took him. I said,
"You young rascal, what have you got?" he said he had given it to a man. On my return I found my stock two pair of shoes deficient. They were there about half an hour before. He was given in charge to Taylor, the headborough.

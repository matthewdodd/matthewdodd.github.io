            . The prisoner went into the parlour on the day in the indictment, and called for a pint of beer; this glass was all in the parlour. In consequence of some information which my servant gave me, I determined to give an eye to the prisoner and the other person who was with him, when they went out. I immediately went into the parlour, and missed he glass in question. I then went out, and overtook the prisoner and brought him back; and he pulled the cruets out of his small clothes, and I took a coffee cup from his coat pocket. I never recovered more of my property. He offered to pay for the glass, but I told him I was determined to check depredations of this kind, and I should pursue the law accordingly.

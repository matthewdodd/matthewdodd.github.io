GEORGE HUTCHINSON
. I live with Joseph Jackson, in Shoreditch. On the 15th of April, about ten o'clock at night, there was an alarm at the door—the shop was not shut then—I went to the door and a person told me the prisoner had just run down the court with a roll of flannel—I pursued him—he dropped the flannel in Blossom-place—I called"Stop theif"—a gentleman came out, and took him as he was climbing the wall—I took him back to the shop, and met a policeman, and gave him in charge—I had seen him watching about the shop for three weeks before.





ALFRED PRATT

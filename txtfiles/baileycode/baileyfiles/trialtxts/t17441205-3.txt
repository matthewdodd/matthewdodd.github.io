            . The Prisoner was my servant
. My man said to me, the Sunday before Lord Mayor's day, Master, I believe James has got one of your spoons. I said to the Prisoner, James, I believe you have got one of my silver spoons in your pocket, and bid him pull it out, which he did; and I found by the mark that it was not mine. Said I, I believe you have stole this from one of my customers. I went to Mr. Sadler's, and saw two spoons with the same letters. He said he found this spoon, and a green purse with 18 s. in it, and that the purse was in the hayloft, upon such a beam, and I found it there - he has lived with me but a little while; he is a Yorkshire boy. I went down to buy some horses, and he desired to ride one up for me.

WILLIAM SWEENEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of June, 1 cloak, value 10s., the goods of 



George Scott; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE SCOTT
. I am eleven years old, and live with my uncle in Vincent-square. I had a cloak on the 20th of June—my mama bought it for me—I saw it safe that afternoon hanging out in the garden—it was missing afterwards—this is it.





JAMES HOLT
 (police-constable B 124.) I saw the prisoner about twenty minutes past three o'clock that afternoon with this cloak under his left arm—be saw me and threw it away—I took it up and pursued him.

Prisoner. I never saw the cloak till he charged me with it—I was in a public-house, and he came and called me out. Witness. I am quite confident he threw it away—he was not more than thirty yards from where the prosecutor lives when I first saw him.





WILLIAM WARDLAW
 (police-constable B 87.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace office at Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

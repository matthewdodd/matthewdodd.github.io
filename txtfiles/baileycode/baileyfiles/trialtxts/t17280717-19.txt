             depos'd, That his Mother keeping a Sale Shop
, the Jacket mentioned in the Indictment, lay with other Goods upon the Counter, and that he heard him snatch it away; upon which he followed him, and saw him running along with the Jacket upon his Arm, but finding himself pursued, he dropp'd it, yet this Deponent never lost Sight of him till he was taken.
Mr. Stubbs depos'd, That he heard the Cry of Stop Thief, and saw the Prisoner with the Jacket on his Shoulder, and likewise saw him drop it.
The Prisoner said in his Defence, That he had it of a Boy, and he being in Liquor, could not exactly tell the Particulars, but this idle Excuse, without Witness availed nothing, for the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d.

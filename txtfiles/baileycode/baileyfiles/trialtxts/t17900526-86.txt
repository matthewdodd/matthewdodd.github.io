I am a working man. On the 30th of April, I saw the prisoner in the afternoon, between four and five, come out of Mr. Taylor's warehouse with a bundle under his arm; I pursued him; he dropped the bundle on the wharf; I picked it up, and called Mr. Taylor, who was on the wharf, and he took the prisoner; we went into the warehouse, and found a hogshead of sugar broke open.

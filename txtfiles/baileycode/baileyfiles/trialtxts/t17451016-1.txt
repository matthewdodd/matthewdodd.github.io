            . My wife took the Prisoner in out of the London work-house naked, and clothed her, and kept her about a fortnight, and then she robbed me of these things, (she is a relation of mine) which she confessed she took out of my drawer, and told me she had pawned one ring, and the snuff-box to one Greg in Barnaby street, Southwark; and one to another person, and the other two rings she had given to two of the keepers of the London work-house. One of them told me she owed him 7 s. and three half-pence; and I could not get either of them. I was informed that one was sold for 19 shillings. The Prisoner told me she had lost the guinea, and the sleeve buttons out of a handkerchief she had tied the things up in, and that she took a coach, and the coachman went away with the hat.
Mr. Reilly said he saw the snuff-box taken out of pawn, and knows it to be the Prosecutor's. 


               Guilty 39 s.

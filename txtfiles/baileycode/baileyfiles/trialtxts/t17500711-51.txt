I stepped out and saw the prisoner go down the steps at the Bagnio, I pursued him, he let two pint pots fall in Barkin alley, and a quart pot in Seothing lane; I took him in Water lane, he was going down into a wine cellar; these pots we had had from the prosecutor with beer, they have Mr. Bushell's name on them, they were produced in court. Mr. Bushell deposed to them as his property.
Prisoner's Defence. I never was near the place, or wronged any one of a pin's pint in my life. I was coming down Tower-hill, a man came against me and pushed me down, they cried out stop thief, so they laid hold on me.

                     William

            . I took the Prisoner at the Bar from the Parish Workhouse in Beech-lane, about five Weeks ago, there were two Guineas found in a Bird-cage, which gave me some Suspicion; then I tax'd her how she came by the Things she had bought? At first she told me, that her Uncle had sent them out of Oxfordshire. I found the Place where she bought a Gold Necklace, and a silver Spoon, and a golden Locket mark'd in her own Name J. F. I ask'd her how she came by the new Pair of Pumps. Stuff for Shifts, and for a Gown.
Q. How much Money did you miss?
Allen. I miss'd twenty-nine Guineas and a half; two Guineas were found in the Bird-cage, so that but twenty-seven and a half were lost. She bought the Necklace at a Silversmith's opposite to Porter's-Block; her Name is Lilly. I have seen one Guinea which I am very positive of by the Mark under the China Queen Anne's Guinea, which she changed with Mr Dawes.

            . I keep a Publick-house. On the 15th Day of August the Prisoner called for half a Pint of Beer; she told me she was going to fetch a Pint of Wine for her Mistress, for she was very ill, and desired me to change a Guinea.
Q. How came you to take any Notice of it ?
Dawes. It was so late I did not know whether she came honestly by it or not.
Q. Had you any other Guinea at that Time ?
Dawes. No, Sir.

            . I know the Prisoner before she lived at the Prosecutor's. My Sister lives at the Workhouse, and I was there; the Prisoner brought the Clothes, which she said her Uncle had sent out of Oxfordshire.

            , Esq: On Wednesday the 19th of August, this 
               
                  William 
                  Allen 
               



             brings the Prisoner. He said his Wife must charge her. I said to him, must I stay till your Wife comes ? if you can make nothing more appear, I must discharge her. By and by the Wife comes, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Allen 
               



            . I said, what have you to charge the Prisoner with ? Sir, said she, I have not any thing to charge her with (or Words to that effect ) nor would I say any thing against her. Here is Witness that 
               
                  William 
                  Allen 
               



             beat his Wife because she would not give Evidence.

            . I took the Minutes on the 19th of August. I am Clerk to Squire Withers, and the Prisoner was brought before him, and 
               
                  William 
                  Allen 
               



             he declared, they brought her down without Constable or any Warrant. After that the Constable came down, one Mr Nelson; but the Prisoner was discharg'd, as there was nothing William Allen could charge her with. They spoke of four Guineas and a half, and no more, before Justice Withers. Mrs Allen was often times ask'd the Question by me, and by his Worship once or twice, and she refused to give any Account of the Matter; she said she had lost nothing, nor would she charge the Prisoner. The Prosecutor d - d his Wife in the Passage; D - n you, must I be robb'd and you not swear.



               Guilty

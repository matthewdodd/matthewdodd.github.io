                  JOHN 
                  BROWNING
               



            . Q. Are you the brother of the lady to whom the prisoner was married in 99 - A, I am.
Q. Your father I believe is dead - A. He is.
Q. Look at that register, and say whether you believe the signature of that marriage to be your father's hand writing - A. It is his to the best of my knowledge.
Q. Is your sister now living - A. She now is.
Q. Where did your father live - A. At Eston, ten miles from Canterbury, near Ashbourne, it lies between Ashbourne and Canterbury.
Q. How long did your sister live with him after her marriage - A. He was with her two years nearly, at times with my father.
Q. Therefore he knew your father's residence well - A. He made my father's house his home.
Q. Do you know how long after the marriage it was that he left your sister - A. That I cannot rightly say; he left her several times, I think it was about three years that he left her, I believe at Margate or Ramsgate he left her.
Court. How long had he lived with her, before he finally deserted her - A. About three years, to the best of my knowledge: from the time of his deserting her, she lived with my father during his life, and with my mother since his death. They have removed since to Ashbourne.
Q. If any body was to enquire for your sister, there would be no difficulty in finding her - A. No. She had one child by him, dead born.
Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask him one question. As he says that I have deserted this lady, his sister, is he aware of the cause of my leaving her at Ramsgate, in the year 1801 - A. I am not certain of it, he left her in great distress.
Q. I wish to ask you in what kind of distress I left this lady - A. He went away and left her without any money in her pocket, and also took her clothes from her, and pawned her clothes.
Q. I do not wish to take the witness by surprise; will he swear that I pawned his sister's cloathes - A. From what I heard my sister say.
Q. Had I any marriage portion with your sister - A. That I cannot say; my father frequently supplied you with money, to my certain knowledge.
Q. Speaking within the mark, do you know what was the amount - A. I cannot speak to that exactly; he advanced money several different times; to what extent I do not know.
Q. Upon your oath to what extent he may suppose, does he imagine to the amount of one hundred pounds, or any such sum - A. Considerably more.
Q. More than five hundred pounds do you imagine - A. I cannot say that it was more than an hundred.
Court. What way of life was your father in - A. A farmer.
Prisoner. I wish to ask the witness whether he means to maintain, upon his oath, that I lived with his sister three years: as I was an officer in the South Loyal Gloucester militia, whether I did not leave this lady in my military character - A. I never saw him until after they were married. I never saw him in uniform; he was a military man at that time.
Q. As seduction seems to be laid to my charge more than bigamy, is he aware that I met his sister about six o'clock; and went away with her the same night - A. He did, but not the same afternoon.
Q. Does he mean to swear that she did not come away at twelve o'clock at night, from her father's house; does he mean to contend that it was not the same afternoon
Mr. Alley. I object to that question.
Court. Have you any reason to know that your sister came away with him the first day that she was acquainted with him - A. To the best of my knowledge she was acquainted first with him at Canterbury, and at this time the regiment laid at Ashbourne.
Mr. Gurney. How long were they acquainted before they were married - A. About a month before they went away together.
Q. Your sister eloped from your father's house with the prisoner, upon which your father came to London, and sanctioned the marriage with his presence - A. He did.
Q. After leaving your sister two or three times, distressed, he finally left her - A. Them were not the only times he left her.

Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, being a batchelor, and an officer in the South Glocester regiment, I was married in 1779 under twenty years of age, without the knowledge of my father, and 
               
                  Jane 
                  Browning
               



            , under age, a spinster. I entertained some doubt of her fidelity, with my companion, one Thompson, I was going to London, to obtain legal redress, and I applied to Mr. John Ingram Lockhart, a barrister, and stated to him the facts, he gave me perfect assurance that I could not sustain any damages, that all marriages under age, by the act of 
               George
             the Second were invalid by law, which opinion of Mr. Lockhart I found confirmed by Burn's Justice, and Blackstone's reports; and after 99, having no interview with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Browning

            ; I applied again to Mr. Lockhart, who did not swerve from this opinion. Upon this, the marriage took place in October, 1808.

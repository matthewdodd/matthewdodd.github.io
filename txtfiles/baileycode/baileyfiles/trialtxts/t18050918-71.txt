             sworn. - I left my tools in a lower room in Mr. Gervaise's building; they were found afterwards in Mr. Richardson's field.
Q. Do you know who took them? - A. I know no more than he confessed to me himself.
Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess, or worse if he did not? - A. No.
Q. Had you ever seen him before the things were stole? - A. He came in on the 9th of September; he said he was ashamed to be seen lurking about, and he sat on the stool; at four o'clock I left work, and the prisoner went out and sat upon some bricks, and he drank part of half a gallon of beer with me; on Tuesday morning, when I went to work, the tools were gone.
Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime.

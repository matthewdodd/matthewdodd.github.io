            . I was late out at night on the 9th of March; I called at the watch-house and desired to rest myself; I was a little in liquor, but could discern very well what happened; I took my watch out at one o'clock to see the time, there were nobody in the room but the two prisoners, who are watchmen, and myself; I went to sleep, when I awaked again I missed my watch; I charged the prisoners with taking it; they denied it; Beven said he had no watch. I had them taken before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and there Beven owned taking it; and took us to the pawnbroker's where it was pawned.
John Hill. Beven pawned this watch ( producing it) with me; he described the marks of it so that I had no scruple in taking it.

             a constable deposed, that he took the prisoner into custody, and that Jones confessed he was concerned in taking the watch, and that they shared the money.
The prisoners called two or three witnesses, who gave them a good character.
Both 


               guilty of stealing, but not privately from the person
            .

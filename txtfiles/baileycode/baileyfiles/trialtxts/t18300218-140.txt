            . I am a music-copyer. About five o'clock in the evening of the 13th of February, I saw the two prisoners in Piccadilly - they attempted several shops; I watched them to the prosecutor's, at the corner of Francis-street


 - I saw Ward take the trousers, and run towards Golden-square; I pursued, but lost sight of him - I returned, and saw Clayton endeavouring to take another pair; I told the person in the shop of it, and we went to the watch-house, and gave notice - I afterwards saw the prisoners together, I told the officer, and they were taken.
Clayton. Q. How did you know us again? A. I had noticed you in Piccadilly.

            . I am in partnership with Benjamin Bankley. I had hung up a pair of trousers, which were lost - I have never seen them since.
Clayton's Defence. I was not near the shop.

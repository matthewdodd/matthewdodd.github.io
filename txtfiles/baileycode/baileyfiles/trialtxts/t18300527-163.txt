. The prisoner came to my shop repeatedly; he came about two o'clock last Tuesday - I was in the parlour and watched him; I saw him take this waistcoat, open his coat, and put it under his arm; I took him with it.
Prisoner. I cannot deny the charge - starvation and hunger were the cause of it. GUILTY.
The indictment further stated that the prisoner had been previously convicted of felony.

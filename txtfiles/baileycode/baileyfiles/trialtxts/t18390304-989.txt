 Matthews,

 and 




JOHN ORANGE
,
were indicted 

for stealing, on the 
15th of February, 1 hearth-rug, value 8s., the goods of 



George Bartholomew and others, their masters.






GEORGE BARTHOLOMEW
. I am a hearth-rug manufacturer in Little Moorfields, and have partners—the two prisoners and the witness Dean, were employed in my manufactory—I did not miss the rug till my attention was drawn to it.





REUBEN DEAN
. I worked for Messrs. Bartholomew, with the prisoners. One Monday night, about six weeks ago, about half-past five o'clock, they both spoke to me, and asked me whether I would take a rug out and pawn it—I told them no—I was outside with Taylor, and Orange gave it us through the iron bars—Orange afterwards came out, and we all went into Finsbury-square to the pawnbroker's—Taylor went in with the rug—I and Orange remained outside—Taylor came out and said the pawnbroker desired him to send for his father—we were all going down the street, and were taken into custody—I told this story before the Magistrate.





WILLIAM HORGOOD
. I am a pawnbroker. Taylor brought this rug to me, and asked me to lend him 6s. on it—I asked him who it belonged to—he said, to his father, who was a cabinet-maker, and that be himself was a cabinet-maker, and his name was Matthews—I told him to send his father to me—I sent my lad to watch him—he saw him join the other two, and they were brought back to my shop.





GEORGE CHAPMAN
. I took the prisoners into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

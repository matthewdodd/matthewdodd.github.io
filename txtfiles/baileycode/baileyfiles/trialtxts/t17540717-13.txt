Lomax Ryder. I employed the prisoner's daughter in making hoop petticoats. On the 14th of May she came into the shop for work to carry to her daughter, and some little time after she had left the shop my servant, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Smith 
               



            , told me she had robbed me.


                  Thomas 
                  Smith 
               



            . About 8 or 9 at night the 14th of May, the prisoner brought in her daughter's work, I bid her stay a little while and I would give her more. She stayed about an hour, and I gave her a piece of cloth to carry to her daughter as usual. She went and reached something from the compter, I then was suspicious she had taken something. I observed as she went out of the shop she endeavoured to conceal something in her apron: this encreased my suspicion, I called to her and she stopped; then I went and asked her if she had not more about her than belonged to her. I looked into her apron and there I found this piece of sattin.
Prosecutor. It is my property.
Smith. I carried her back, and all she could say for herself was, that she took it in the room of the cloth I gave her to carry to her daughter's.
Q. Was it possible she could make such a mistake?
Smith. No, she could not.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence, but called six people to her character, who gave her a good one.

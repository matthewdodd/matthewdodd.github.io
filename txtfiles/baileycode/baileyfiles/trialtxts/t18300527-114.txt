            . I am single
, and live at the public-house in which the prisoner lodged. I lost my gown on the 29th of April, from a box in the room adjoining where he slept; on that morning he came down and went into the yard - he came in again and went up stairs; he then came and asked me for his bundle, and I gave it him - he went up again for his gaiters, as he said; he came down again, had half a pint of beer, and went out; I went up stairs, and found my box had been disturbed - I looked, and missed my gown; I told my master.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in Hounslow; the witness' master was with me, and gave me charge of him - I found the gown in his bundle; he did not give any account of it.

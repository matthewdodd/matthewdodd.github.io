WILLIAM WITHERS, JUN
. I live with my parents in Nutford-place, Edgware-road. On the 6th of May my mother gave me a bundle of shirts, and other things, to take to the prisoner's mother, who is a washerwoman—as I was going along, I saw the prisoner lying down on the grass in the fields—he asked me if I was going to his mother—I put the bundle down while I pulled my handkerchief out of my pocket—the prisoner laid his head on the bundle, and then he took it to carry for me—he went into a public-house with it, and told me to stay a minute—I staid, but he did not come out—it was then between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I went to Mrs. Williams directly—this is the handkerchief the linen was tied in—the pawnbroker has one of the shirts.





SARAH WITHERS
. I am the wife of William Withers. I packed up the bundle containing the shirts and property stated—this is one of the shirts which was in the bundle; and this is the handkerchief in which they were tied.





LOUISA CLARKE
. I am the daughter of Mrs. Williams, and sister-in-law of the Prisoner. This little boy came to me—I went to the pawn-broker's, where I found the prisoner pawning this shirt, about four o'clock—when he heard my voice he ran out—I ran after him—he was takes in to my sight.





HENRY SWAIN
. I am a pawnbroker. On the 6th of May, about a quarter to four o'clock, the prisoner brought this shirt into our shop—the last witness came in to know if we had any linen pawned there—he heard her voice, and ran off—I pursued, and brought him back—he said he did not care, for he wished to be transported; and he had been obliged sleep two nights in the open air.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

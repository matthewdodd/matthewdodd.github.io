            . I live at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, but did live in Old-square, Lincoln's Inn. On the 21st of February I was at Whitehall


; I felt a slight pressure behind me - I looked round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, which had been safe in my pocket shortly before; he threw it down, and ran away - I pursued, and took him; a lady I had been walking with took up the handkerchief, and gave it me.

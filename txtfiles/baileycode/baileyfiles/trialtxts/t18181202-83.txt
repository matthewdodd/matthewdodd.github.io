            . I am agent to George and Henry Harrison, and live in Bryanston-square, Marylebone


, next door to them. I was sitting in my house, about eight o'clock in the evening, and heard a knocking. I got the key, and called the watchman. We went down the area where we found the prisoner, he had just cut the lead off some pipe which comes from the street, he was sitting on a brick in the area, and the pipe was laying by him - he said he did it through distress.

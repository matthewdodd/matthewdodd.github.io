JAMES BENNETT
. I keep a ham and beef shop in the Lower-road, Islington. About five minutes before eleven o'clock on the evening of the 12th of May I was in the back of my premises, and coming into the shop again I caught sight of a boy with a ham—I gave information, and the ham was brought back soon after.





WILLIAM SCOTT
. I live in Lower-street, Islington. I was at the corner of Queen's Head-lane, and saw the prisoner and another together—they made a stop—they had got the ham in their possession, and the prisoner said,' "Here he comes, let us go"—they went down a lane—the policeman was coming after them.





FREDERICK ROBERT HERBERT
 (police-constable N 93.) I stopped the prisoner—he threw the ham down.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming across the fields, and the policeman took me—I had not had the ham.

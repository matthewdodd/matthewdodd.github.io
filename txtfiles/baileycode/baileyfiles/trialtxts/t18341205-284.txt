FREDERICK SWINDELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of December, 1 sheet, value 10s., the goods of 



Henry Port.






JOHN ELLIOTT
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 11th of December, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered this sheet to pledge—I saw it was a very fine one, and asked whose it was—he said his mother's, who took in washing, and had sent him with it—I then examined it, and saw a mark partly picked out—I asked him again whose it was—he said it belonged to a man in a baragen frock, at the Cherry-tree—I left him in care of a person, and went to look for the man he described, but could not find any one.





HENRY PORT
. I live in Brook-terrace, Clapton. My wife takes in

washing—she had this sheet to wash, and it was hung out to dry—I saw it safe at five o'clock on that evening, and it was gone in twenty minutes.

Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and said he would give me 6d. to pawn the sheet—I said, "What name shall I say?'—he said, "Tell them it is your mother's"—I told the pawnbroker so, and then I told him who gave it me.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

. Hayter came and took my lodging on the 25th of March - she asked if I would let her husband look at it; Rawlins stood opposite: she beckoned him up - he said, "My dear, do you like the room?" she said, "Yes - it is 4s. 6d. if I find sheets and 5s. if I don't;" they came in the same night, and were there all the week; they went in and out several times -Hayter came on the Saturday evening, about six o'clock, and said, "Is my husband here?" I said No; she said,"What a lucky house your's is - my husband has met with a person who paid him half a sovereign, and I am to have another presently, and will pay you;" the articles stated were my property, and are all lost.
Prisoner RAWLINS. Q. Do you say I was present looking at the lodging? A. Yes; I have heard you there as late as half-past ten o'clock - I never saw you go out with a bundle.

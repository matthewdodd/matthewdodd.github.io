JAMES VALENTINE
. I am foreman to John Howard, who lives at No, 130, Tottenham-court-road—he is a shoemaker. On the 26th of January the prisoner came into the shop—I was engaged at the window, and heard a noise in the corner—I looked, and missed a pair of boots—I saw the prisoner going away—she had got out about three or four yards—I went, and said, "What have you got?"—she said, "Nothing; I was looking at a pair of shoes"—I carried her back, and she dropped these boots—I had seen her on the Tuesday before, and then I missed a pair.

Prisoner. I put them down before you, when you abused me, and said you knew I had been at the shop before, which I had not. Witness. A person came in and offered to pay for these; and I should have let her go, but the shopwoman came down, and said she recollected her being there before—these are my master's boots.




GUILTY
. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            ; he is a gardener
.
Q. When did you lose this coat. - A. Yesterday morning I lost it out of a cart; the cart was standing at Mr. Kemp's door, No. 7, Aldgate


. I had been to Newgate market, and returning home, I called at this house, and left the coat in the cart; I got into the shop, and delivered a few flowers and a few radishes; I was talking to the shopman; I saw the prisoner take the coat out of the cart, and run away with it. I told the young man in the shop; he run after him, and took him; the coat was brought back, and the man was secured in Mr. Kemp's shop till an officer came.

            . About eight o'clock I was in my master's shop; this good woman came in; I saw the prisoner come by; he took the coat out of the cart. I went after him, and overtook him, about ten or twelve yards off; he said, is it your coat? I said, no, nor is it yours. With the assistance of another man, we took him back to my master's shop; we kept him till the constable came.
FRANCIS KINNERSLEY. I am an officer; I took charge of the prisoner, and this coat was in his possession.
Prisoner's Defence. I must leave every thing to the gentlemen of the court.

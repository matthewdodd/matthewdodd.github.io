, and had my handkerchief in my possession - I did not see the prisoner near me, nor feel the handkerchief taken - a gentleman gave me information; he is not here; I applied to my pocket and it was gone - I turned round and several persons were near me, waiting to cross the road; after the gentleman gave me information I saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hands; I laid hold of him, and he directly threw it down at my feet; it was delivered to Wiltshire - he said another boy gave it to him; the gentleman said he would not come here.
JURY. Q. Did he say he saw him take it? A. Yes.
WILLIAM WILTSHIRE. I am a City policeman; the prisoner was brought to me charged with this offence; the handkerchief was given to me also.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. Some boy chucked it on me, and it fell down into the street; I don't know who it was.
MR. JONES. No other boy was near him.

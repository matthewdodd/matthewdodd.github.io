            . I met the prisoner in Islingtonfields on the 11th of October, with this rug tucked in his blue apron - I followed him across one field, then stoppedand asked where he was going - he would give no answer; I asked where he got it - he said he found it; I asked where? he took me back and shewed me a place which he had passed while I was following him - I then seized him.

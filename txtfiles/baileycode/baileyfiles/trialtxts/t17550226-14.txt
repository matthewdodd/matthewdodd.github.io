            . I am a tallow chandler
, and live in Bear-lane, Tower-street


; on the 11th of February, between six and seven in the evening, I was backwards, I heard a rusling in the shop, I went into the shop, and found my till was gone and I saw a boy jump off the threshold of the door I called out, Stop thief! stop thief! I ran to the door, saw a boy run up the lane; I saw the till fall, I took it up, with two shillings in silver, and some halfpence in the till; the prisoner was brought back by 
               
                  John 
                  Haystings 
               



            , and the next day he was taken before my Lord-Mayor, there he confessed he took the till out of my shop.

            . I was in Tower-street, and the prisoner came up out of Bear-lane, and dropt the till close by me, and he was never out of my sight till he was stopt, and I took him, and brought him back.
Prisoner's defence.
This was not the man that stopt me; I don't know who it was.

             (Police-constable D 147.) On the 2nd of June, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner turn into Cumberland-place, with a shawl in his hand - he ran down Bryanstone-street; I pursued, and asked him where he had got the shawl from - he said he had picked it up.

            . On the 2nd of June I went to a house in Connaught-square, Edgware-road


 - I hung my shawl in the passage leadingto the kitchen; this looks like it, and I believe it is it - that may be half a mile from where the prisoner was stopped; I hung it up about ten minutes after seven o'clock, and it was found about half-past seven.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Connaught-square, and saw the handkerchief by a lamp-post in Seymour-street - I took it.

            , Jan. 31
. +
I live in Essex. On the 31st of January I lost eight hogs from a barn in my fields; I pursued them to Smithfield, there I heard they were sold; I afterwards saw them in Wood's-Close, in the possession of Mr. Ambridge, they were then all alive: I asked Mr. Ambridge how he came by them; he said he bought them of Mr. Cockrill.

                  Cockrill 
               



            . I am a dealer in hogs in Smithfield; I bought 8 hogs on the 31st of Jan. of 
               
                  James 
                  Butcher 
               



            , Nathaniel was by when I paid him for them. I sold them again to Mr. Ambridge.
Q. What did you give for them?
Cockrill. I gave 9 l. 5 s. for them, which at that time was the real value of them.

            . I am a dealer in hogs I saw my brother buy these hogs of 
               
                  James 
                  Butcher 
               



            .


                  Nathaniel 
                  Hayward 
               



            . I am constable, I live at Waldon, about 5 miles from Rumford; the 2 prisoners were taken up for stealing these hogs; James admitted he was guilty of stealing them.
James's Defence.
Mr. Bush and the constable came to me and said, if I would return the money I should be acquitted.
James 

               Guilty
            . 


               T
            .
Nathaniel 

               Acquitted
            .

As the prisoners could not bring the hogs out of Essex to Smithfield without bringing them through part of Middlesex, the prosecutor had a right to have them tried by the Middlesex Jury.

CHARLES WIGGINS
 and 




JAMES CARTER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
2nd of December, 6 pigs, price 5l. 2s., the property of 



Thomas Andrews.






THOMAS ANDREWS
. I live in Salisbury-street I had six pigs alive and safe in my stable in Portman-market about half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of December—Miller came to me the next morning, and I went to William-street, Portland-town—I there saw the pigs—I am sure they were mine—they were spotted pigs, two barrow pigs and four sows.





RICHARD MILLER
. I live in William-street, Portland-town, and am a green-grocer. On the 2nd of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I bought these six pigs in the street, round by the Crown public-house, for 3l. 12s., of the prisoners—I was going by with my cart, and Wiggins said, "Is your name Miller?"—I said, "Yes"—I saw the pigs, and asked "Whose are they?"—he said, "Mine and my mate's"—there was no one there but the two prisoners—they asked me 14s. a-piece—I offered 12s. a-piece—I they agreed to sell them at that, and they turned them down the street—I went into the public-house and paid Carter the money, but Wiggins was close to him—they called for half-a-pint of gin, but did not give me any—Wiggins said he wished me luck with my pigs—I heard the same day that they were stolen—I went the next morning and gave information to the prosecutor.





THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant E 4.) On Friday the 4th of December, I went and took Miller in charge—he said he bought the pigs of Wiggins and Carter for 3l. 12s. Mr. Andrews identified them.





JOHN GRAINGER
 (police-sergeant D 21.) I took Wiggins—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing six pigs—when we got into the street he

said, "Is any one in custody?"—I said, "Yes, Carter"—he said, "Then I suppose he has split"


Wiggins. I humbly beg for mercy.

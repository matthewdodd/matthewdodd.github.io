            . I am a carpenter at Drury-lane Theatre, and live in Hampstead-road. On the morning of the 6th of February I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Foulkes' shop, about five minutes before nine o'clock, with a piece of carpet on his shoulder - he ran up Drury-lane - I followed, and stopped him; I asked him where he was going with it - he said, to No. 13, Lower Grosvenor-street, and that a shopman of the name of Smith gave him 6d. to carry it there; I said, "I know Mr. Foulkes very well, and if you will come back with me I will see about it" - he said, "You don't think I stole it?" I said, No, I had no right to think so. I went back, and asked the shopman if that was their carpet - they said Yes, that they had heard the door go, but had not seen the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was called into the shop to take it to No. 13, Lower Grosvenor-street.

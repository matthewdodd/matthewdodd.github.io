JOSEPH MESSENGER. I am an undertaker
. On the 26th of September, a little before eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the top of Great Queen-street


. I had a handkerchief in my pocket - I felt a jerk, and on looking round, in less than a minute, I saw my handkerchief in the possession of the prisoner. Phillips had him custody - he was stepping off the curb when he was taken.

                  PHILLIPS
               



            . I was in the street, and saw the prisoner attempting the prosecutor's pocket - he took the handkerchief out - but he saw me watching him, and dropped it. I seized him, and he struck me on the head and face, and attempted to get away, but I held him until the Bow-street patrol happened to come by.

            . I saw the prisoner fighting in the road, and heard Phillips call the watchman - I secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. A lady picked it up, and gave it to me.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.

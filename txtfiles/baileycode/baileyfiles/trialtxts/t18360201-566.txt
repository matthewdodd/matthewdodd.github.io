MARIA NEWTON
. I am servant to Miss Ann Nash, of Camden-tow, Kentish Town. She had a copper at her house, fixed to a building—it was lost on the 6th of January—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How do you know it? A. By the burn; there was water in it when it when it was stolen—I can swear to it by the burn at the side, and grease inside—I saw it between eleven and twelve o'clock in the wash-house—I did not miss it till the policeman came in the evening—the wash-house is at the bottom of the garden.





ALEXANDER LYON
 (police-constable S 43.) I was son duty in Camden-town, and saw the prisoner with a copper on the evening of the 6th of January—he went to Mr. Bignell's—I heard him ask Mr. Bignell to buy the copper—I came in, and asked were be got it from—he said, "From Mr. Sherriff of Kentish-town"—I said I was not satisfied, and he must go with me there; and when we got outside the door, he said he had stolen it.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you said he had better tell you all about it? A. No—I left the copper at the shop—I got back again about seven o'clock—I know it was the same I had left, by my initials, which I had put on it—the prisoner said he had stolen it when he came out of the shop—he did not tell me where from.





GEORGE WILLIAM MURRAY
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from the office of the clerk of the Court (read) the prisoner is the man who was tried.


Prisoner. The Policeman has been telling falsehoods.
(William Carroll, a painter and glazier, of Kentish-town Benjamin Swain, a tinman, of Kentish-town; and Edward Gibley, a slater, of Somers'-town; gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—

             . I live at the dyer's shop in Lothbury . I saw from thence the prisoner go into Mr. Wright's shop, a carpenter, opposite the way, and bring out this hat and wig. I follow'd and brought him back to my master's shop, with the hat and wig, till the prosecutor came home. We sent for him, and he owned the hat and wig.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going by, and found the hat and wig lying at the carpenter's door. Seeing nobody nigh it, I went and took it; and asked a person if it belonged to him? He said it was not his; so he went about his business, and I about mine; then they came and took hold on me.
Q. to Bentley. Did you see the prisoner within the door?
Bentley . I did. He went into the shop, and brought the hat out under one arm, and the wig in his right-hand.

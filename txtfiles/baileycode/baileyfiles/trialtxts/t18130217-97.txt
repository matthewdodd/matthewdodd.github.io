            . On the evening of the 17th of this month, I was in Clement's inn, coming out of the gate, towards the Strand. I saw the prisoner making towards Clement's-lane. As soon as I got out of the gate, I stepped across, and stopped him. A second person came up and laid hold of him by the other side. He said, what do you stop me for; I have done nothing. I said, my friend, if you have done nothing, you can have no objection to go back. Thornton came up, and said, that is the man that robbed me.
Prisoner's Defence. I was making through Clement's inn to go to Westminster. The prosecutor said, I was the person that took the paper. He never saw me before.

            . I am servant to Mr. William Cording, a pawnbroker
, who lives in Aldgate High-street


. I have known the prisoner before - she came, about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of June, to the shop, and inquired the price of several articles of wearing-apparel - after she had looked some time I missed a linen shirt, which had been hanging in the shop, half a yard from her; I saw her concealing something under her shawl - I went round, and she turned, with her back towards me, and I saw the shirt sleeve hanging down; I took hold of her arm, and said she had taken a shirt - at that instant I saw it full. I gave her in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went to pawn a shawl, and found this shirt at the door - I picked it up, and said, "This is not mine." I was going in when he stopped me.

            . On the King's coronation between eight and nine at night I went to the church, the bells were then ringing, and I had a mind to divert myself, and I believe then I lost these things. The Prisoner was my fellow servant
, and no body else was in the house; I got my master's horse the next day and followed him, and between three and four in the afternoon I took him in London with the things upon his back; he got out of my arms, and run away, I cried stop thief, and he cried so too.
Prisoner. There was a fellow who lay two or three nights in the barn sold them to me. - I went from my master because I could not do his work.
His master declared he did not know of his going away before he was gone, and lent Hunt his nag to go after him.

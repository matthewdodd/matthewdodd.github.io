Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I lament much the miserable situation that I am put in, and much more so that my embarrasment will not afford me council; I shall wait for that justice from your Lordship which is the characteristic of this court; I humbly beg to state that I was married to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Partman
               



             and was not more than two days in the house, I left her in possession of the house and property in the same situation I found her and I have not since heard of her for fourteen years, I was informed she was dead and I considered her so or I should not have married a second wife to offend the laws of my country and blast my happiness; I protest to your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury that I was allured into the marriage of 
               
                  Jane 
                  Covell
               



             by the prosecutrix herself, from the 17th of March she was a constant visitor at my lodgings; I made her acquainted that I was only a journeyman and was in debt five pounds, her answer was that she could better my situation provided that I could carry on my business for her support and my own; I made no false representation to her in any one instance; she purchased the ring herself, paid the expence of the marriage and also the expences of the day, I was not in possession of a penny at the time; I am now forty-five or fifty pounds in debt, I was that sum in debt on the last day in September, which debt she contracted herself, nor was I ever brought in court before. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Covell
               



            's son, I see him here, he is a bedstead maker and under twenty years of age, his father at his decease left him two hundred and fifty pounds in the four per cents, in consequence of his being under age he could not become possesed of the money, and his mother wanting him to go into business I became bondsman to one Mr. Page and his mother another, for should he be dead before the money became due it devolved to his sister. I am informed that my first wife 
               
                  Mary 
                  Partman
               



             should be in court and had she been living I am confident she would, I entertain an anxious hope that your Lordship and the Jury will believe me on my solemn protest to God that if I have erred against the laws of my country I committed it innocently, I was informed in 1808 that my wife was dead when I returned from Egypt.

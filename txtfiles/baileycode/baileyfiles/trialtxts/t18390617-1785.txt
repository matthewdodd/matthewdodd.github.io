SARAH STACEY
. I am a widow, and live at Chelsea. On the 22nd of May the prisoners came to my shop—M'Nally wanted a pair of boot-laces for 1/2 d.—I said I could not find a pair for that, I would give them a pair—I tamed to get them, and then Collins must have taken the hoots—I did not miss them till the policeman brought both the prisoners back.





JOHN SMITHERS
 (police-constable B 67.) I saw the prisoners walking together—M'Nally had something in one of his pockets—I stopped him, and asked him what he had got—he said a pair of boots, which he was going to take for his master to a customer—I went to where he said, and there was no such person—I took them to the station-house, and then be said a boy gave them to him—he afterwards said, he and Collins went into a shop and took them, and he put them into his pocket.

M'NALLY—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.— 



Both Transported for Seven Years.

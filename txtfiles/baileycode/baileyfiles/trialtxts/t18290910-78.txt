            . On the 21st of August, as I was coming down Bruton-street


, about one o'clock in the day, I felt something at my pocket, I turned, and saw the prisoner close at my elbow; he had a new blue coat on and white trousers - I did not think he was the person, but on looking at him I saw my handkerchief in his coat; I took it from him, and collared him - I said, "You rascal, you have got my handkerchief?" he aimed a blow at me, but missed me and got away - I raised an alarm, and he was taken shortly after.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner, with two others, and followed them up the Strand, as I knew them before; they crossed over into Holywell-street


, up to the shop called the Indian Queen - They walked backwards and forwards-the prisoner went to the door, reached the coat, and threw it at his companion, who ran away - I followed, but he escaped with it. I returned and saw the prisoner loitering about the shop, I secured him, the other man ran away. I am sure the prisoner is the man.

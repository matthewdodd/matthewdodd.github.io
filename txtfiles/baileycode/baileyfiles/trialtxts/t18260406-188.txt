            . I am shopman to Mr. William Wakefield, a pawnbroker
, of Mile End-road


. On the 23d of February I was behind the counter, and heard a noise - I jumped over the counter, and went out at the door, where I saw the prisoner making off as fast as he could, with these trousers, which had been hanging on a hook, about two feet within the door - he threw them down. I asked a gentleman to pick them up, and I followed the prisoner down Stepney-green. I never lost sight of him, except for about a second, while he turned the corner; this knife and stick were thrown upon a shutter, as he ran by, but I did not see him throw them; the trousers appear to have been cut down.(Property produced and sworn to).

Prisoner's Defence. I was near the end of Stepneygreen, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran - the gentleman came, and said I was his prisoner. I had been out of work three weeks. I saw a man rush past me, and into an empty house.

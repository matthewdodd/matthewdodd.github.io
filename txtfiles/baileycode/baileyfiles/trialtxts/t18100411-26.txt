JOHN CALLAGHAN. I work for Mr. Richards, a stone-mason. On the 21st of March I was coming into his shop about two o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner with the baize on his arm. I asked him where he was going with it; he told me, that he was going to get it scoured. I told him he should not go till he told me who authorized him to get it scoured; he turned round in the shop, and wanted to go away; I would not let him; a scuffle ensued, he hit me two blows on the face, he got out in the street, I called for assistance, a gentleman came up, and he was secured.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody, the property was delivered to me.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking in Union-street, I saw three men, I asked them where I could get a job, they said at Mr. Richards's. I went there, walked down the yard, not seeing any body I returned, and coming back I picked up this cloth. This man met me and said, where are you going. I said, to take it in; he struck me and I knocked him down.

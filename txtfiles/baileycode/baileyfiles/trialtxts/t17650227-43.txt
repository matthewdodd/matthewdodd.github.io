            : I can only say his house was broke open last Tuesday was se'nnight; there was a great coat, that used to hang in the entry, and a pair of shoes, my property, taken away: I never found them again.

            . I live servant

            : I was awaked by one of our clerks, who told me the counting-house desk was broke open and robbed: I came down, and looked at it, and by the circumstances I found it must have been done by a person that knew the counting-house well: I miss'd a pair of boots and a pair of shoes, my property, from out of the lower part of the house.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Faulkner. No; at that time I did not my boots were brought to Sir John Fielding's, by a chairman: I saw them there on Monday or Tuesday last: upon inspecting my box, I miss'd a bill of exchange for 100 l. not my property; I had it in trust for a person: I never heard of that since. The prisoner was taken up on the 22d of last month in the evening: Smith, the footman, that is not apprehended, had left a portmanteau at an alehouse in Billiter-lane, the day he was discharged: we desired the landlord if any body came for it, to let us know: the prisoner coming for it, we secured him; there was nothing in the portmanteau but what was Smith's own property: he was put into the Poultry Counter that night; the next day he was committed, by my Lord Mayor, to Newgate; he sent me a message he would be much obliged to me if I would go to see him: I went that evening, that was Saturday was sevennight; he was brought into the tap-house: I asked him what he had to say? he said he wanted much to see me, but did not expect he should; he burst into tears, and exclaimed against Smith and said he had brought him into all this misery: he said he had been with him at a night-house, somewhere near Temple-bar, and he led him to Sir 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Grant 
               



            's house; he was intoxicated so much, he thinks they went in at the gate, and got in at a window, that was not fast on the inside; that Smith left him below, and went up stairs, and brought down the key of the counting-house: and he declared, at this time, he did not know what Smith's intention was; that such a crime never entered his head; and when he saw Smith open the counting house, he said it was a very bad thing, and Smith said never mind it, I shall soon turn out 50 or 60 guineas; he did not tell me what happened in the counting-house: I asked him if he had seen any papers taken out of my desk? he said, he saw none; he was then in great agitation and lamentation; he declared he had none of the effects, that Smith had taken the whole possession of them: I asked him what was taken away besides what was mentioned before my Lord Mayor.
Q. What was he charged with before my Lord Mayor?
Faulkner. He was charged with a roquelo, a furtout coat, and two guineas and a half; the money was the property of Sir 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Grant 
               



            : a surtout coat and a pair of shoes, the property of Mr.

                  Grant 
               



            ; and a pair of boots and pair of shoes of mine, and this bill of exchange which I have mentioned.
Q. What was his answer to your question?

Faulkner. He said he knew of nothing else; as I stood up to go away, he pressed me very hard to come again: I told him a candid confession would induce his prosecutors to lenity; but seeing him in so much sorrow I did not go again.
Q. Was you up first in the morning?
Faulkner. No, I was not.

            . The prisoner at the bar and Smith came to my house, between five and six in the morning of the 20th of last month: Mr. Tupnail brought them in.
Q. Where do you live?
Williamson. I keep the Bee-hive, in Leadenhall-market; they beg'd the favour of me to let them sit down, for they were much in liquor; Tupnail brought in some shoes and boots, I can't tell how many pair; they had two bottles with some rum in them, almost full; there was, I believe, a roquelo and coat; but I bid my boy take care of the things, which he did, and Tupnail went away. The prisoner and Smith sat about half an hour; then they said they would have something to drink; they had a shilling in rum and water; they drank it and sent the shilling and bowl up to me; after that they sat the best part of an hour, and ordered sixpennyworth of rum and water more: I made it and carried it to them; about ten minutes after that Smith had a pennyworth of purl; about eight o'clock Mr. Tupnail came from Mr. Stevens's, the packer, the next door to me, and ordered a pot of purl there: then they insisted upon his drinking with them, so he had a pint of purl; then they all went away together, with the boots and shoes, and every thing they brought with them.

            . Mr. Watton, my fellow-servant, and I, were going to work one morning, at about five o'clock; we rang the bell, for the lad to let us in; this was at Mr. Taylor's, in Leadenhall-street; it was a very cold morning; we went down to the Bee-hive, while the lad got up; coming back, out of Lime-street into Leadenhall-street, there was Smith; he beg'd the favour of our light, saying he had lost something: we looked about, but he gave it over, and at his going away we saw something glance from the candle; there was one boot stood by the side of a post; my partner said, where is your other boot? Smith said I have got the other; he came back again; he had got a bottle of wine in his hand, with the cork drawn; he asked us to drink: we drank cut of the bottle; and at that time the prisoner came up: he seeing the door open, he went down Mr. Taylor's passage six or eight yards: my partner asked him where he was going? he said he wanted to go to bed; he took him by the arm, and led him out again: then they both said they wanted a lodging: I told them it was too early in the morning, being almost day-light, it was not worth their while to go to bed: I said I could take them to a house where was good fare, and they might stay there, which would be better than tumbling about the street. I took a candle and lanthorn, and light them by the India warehouse; the prisoner refused to go: Smith said, do not mind him, for he is my man: I went with them to the Bee-hive, and told Mr. 
               
                  Williamson
               


             I had two men, very much in liquor, and desired he would put by their things: so he ordered the boy to take them.
Q. What things had they?
Tupnail. They had a blue roquelo, a surtout great coat, a pair of boots, and some shoes, in a little hand basket; by their losing a boot I took and tied them with a string, under the handle of the basket?
Q. Which had the things?
Tupnail. The prisoner had them all upon his arm: when we were in the house Smith would treat me, and he pulled out a bottle of rum, and poured some out into a gill glass; I drank a little of it and gave the rest away; then I went to my work again: I was to go to Mr. Stevens's, in Lime-street; but as soon as my master came down he gave me a groat to fetch a pot of purl: I went to the Bee-hive again; then one of them was siting at the out-side of the door, and the other within: then they wanted to go to the other end of the town; they would have a coach: I went as far as the end of Cornhill for one; but after that they would not go into it: the prisoner went down Bishopsgate-street, and the other turned up White-Lion-court.
Q. Which of them had the bottles?
Tupnail. Smith had them in his pocket.

            . On Wednesday morning, the 20th of February, Mr. Tupnail called me up to go to work: we got into Leadenhall-street just about five o'clock: I rang the bell at Mr. Taylor's door; during the time the boy was getting up we went to the Bee-hive, in Leadenhall-market, where we had a pint of hot together; we came back, and at the corner of Lime-street (I had a candle and lanthorn in my hand) a man met me, and said, Halloo, watchman! I said halloo again, I am no watchman: if you want one, there is one yonder: he said he had lost something; he seemed to have things in his pocket. I looked about, and saw a boot in his hand: I said, Where is the other boot? he had a bottle of wine in his hand; he gave it me to drink some: I drank, and so did Tupnail, out of the bottle; he said somebody has picked it up, and was going away: turning round, I saw a boot standing by the side of a post: I called to him, and said, here it is; he came and took it, and said that was his; then we drank more of the wine; he came back to the door: as we were standing there, the prisoner came; as soon as the other man saw him, he said, this is my man: they wanted a lodging; I said they could get none at that time of the morning. The first man, which was Smith, said he came from on board a ship. Tupnail took the candle and lanthorn, and we took them to Mr. Williamson's, at the Bee-hive: the prisoner had some cloaths upon his arm; we came back and left them there.

            's family, when this happened: the housemaid was up first in the morning.
Q. Where is that maid?
Bourn. She is at home; I had been out to market for some butter for my Lady's breakfast, and when I returned, I was told the counting-house had been robbed.

                  Noaks 
               



            . I am a constable for Westminster; I had these boots of 'Squire Rouley's Cook, in St. James's Squire. (Producing a pair of Boots.)
Faulkner. These are my property, which were taken away that night the counting-house was broke open.
Noaks. The cook says he bought the boots of one Knight, a chair-man.
Q. Is that cook here?
Noaks. No, he is not.
Q. Is Knight here?
Noaks. No; he is bound over to prosecute Smith; he knows nothing against the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence.
Last Tuesday se'ennight, about nine o'clock, coming from the city, in order to go to Greenwich, because Smith had an uncle there, lie carried me to Lime-street; he went from me for about three hours: when he came back again, he said, if I would go with him to Greenwich, he would pay my expences. I said, I did not care. Then he ordered me to stay at Lime-street, because he had left a portmanteau there, and he wanted to get clean things to put on: I asked him where they were; he said, at the Thistle and Crown in Billiter-lane: this was about three o'clock: I said, the people would not be up: he desired me to wait there, and said he would be back again in three minutes. I was walking backwards and forwards between Billiter-lane and Lime-street; I found no appearance of his coming; I went down Lime-street, and knocked at the Thistle and Crown door; I came past that gate, and saw a light in the house; I looked to see for Smith: I hollowed out; Smith came out; but I never was within the house: Sir Alexander's gate stood open, but I never was within it. When he came to the end of Billiter-lane, I said, what have you here? he said, I have got my things: he said, Lay hold of that, for I have lost a boot; I took hold of the things, while he looked about for the other boot, and found it; when I saw the other things, I said, Smith, this is not right; you have done something or other: I said, how did you get in? he said he saw the gate open, and he went in and took the things out: I told him I would stay no longer in his company, for he had got them feloniously: I went down Bishopsgate-street, with nothing in my hand, and he went away. Was it the last thing I was to say, I never saw the coat, boots, or shoes, from that time. On the Thursday after, I went to the other end of the town and met with Smith; I asked him what he had done with the things? he said he had sold them to a chairman, or a chairman had sold them for him; I cannot tell which; and that he got 12 s. for them: I never did say to Mr. Faulkner that I was in the house.
For the Prisoner.
Mr. Alvarons. It is out of humanity I have had the honour to attend upon this honourable court; the prisoner lived servant with me about six months; he had all the care of my plate, and several valuable things in my house: I have a desk in my parlour, in which I keep things of value; the prisoner has more than once brought me the key to that desk when I have left it in, or the like. The reason of my parting with him was, he was given to drink, or I should never have parted with him. I gave him a character to another gentleman; the prisoner lived with him two months, and behaved well.
Q. When did he leave your service?
Alvarons. He left my service three months ago; the other gentleman parted with him for the same reason as I did.

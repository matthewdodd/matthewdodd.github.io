GEORGE LEMON
. I live in White Hart-yard, King's-cross, and am a coachmaker. On the 23d of December, between six and seven in the evening, I was in Lancaster-street, Burton-crescent, in my gig, with a friend—I stopped at No. 15, and asked Ormond to hold the horse—I had my cloak in the chaise, and I put it over the horse when I went into the house—I remained about ten minutes—Ormond then knocked at the door, and told me something—I ran down the street in the direction he told me,

but could not see any thing of the cloak—I came back, and spoke to a policeman—the cloak has not been found.





EDWARD ORMOND
. I am ten years old—if I do not speak the truth, I shall go to a bad place—the gentleman put the cloak on the horse, and gave him to me to mind—the prisoner and two other boys came down the street—the prisoner, who was the biggest of them, then came by himself, and asked me what I would take for my chance—I said 2d.—he then went and patted the horse on the neck—there was a whistle, and he whipped the cloak off the horse, and ran away with it—I told the gentleman—we went and could not find him—we told the policeman, and we went to some court in Compton-street, but could not find him—the policeman went home with me, and, in two or three days, the policeman brought the prisoner to the door—I said, "That is him."

Prisoner. It was not me—I know nothing, about it Witness. I am sure he is the boy.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

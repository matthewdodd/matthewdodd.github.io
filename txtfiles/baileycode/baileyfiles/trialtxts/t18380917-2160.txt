GEORGE JACKSON
. I live at Barton Lodge, near Preston, in Lincoln-shire. On Monday night last I was in Fleet-street, about ten o'clock, returning home, accompanied by my son, and between St. Bride's church and Temple-bar, near to Chancery-lane, I was met by a person who gave me a violent push in the stomach—I thought I felt my watch gone—immediaately put my left-hand to my side and found it was so, and at the moment the man who gave me the violent thump took to his heels as quick as possible—I immediately pursued him for about thirty yards before my son came up to me—he passed me, and I called "Stop thief," and continued to purse about fifty yards—he then turned to the left, and went up a small street, through which my son pursued him, and when he was within a few yards of him, I saw a gentleman stop him, and my son seized him—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I gave him in charge, and saw him give my watch up to the officer—this is it—(looking at it.)





SIMON FITZHERBERT JACKSON
. I was walking with my father—he called "Stop thief," and I pursued the prisoner—I gained ground on him and he was secured—I saw him give the watch up to the policeman.





JAMES STEVENS
. I am a watchman of St. Bride's. I heard the alarm of "Stop thief"—pursued and took the prisoner in Shoe-lane—he delivered the watch up to me at the watch-house.





WILLIAM HOWELL
. I was constable of the night—I searched the prisoner—I found nothing but a street-door key on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked the watch up by the side of a gentleman walking along the street—I was going to make my way home to get a lodging for the night.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Ten Years.

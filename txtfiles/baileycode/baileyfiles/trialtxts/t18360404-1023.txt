WILLIAM PRESWICK
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of March, 1 looking glass and stand, value 6s., the goods of 



James Crisp; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES M'INTOSH
 (police-sergeant E 53.) I was in Queen's-row, Pimlico, on the 19th of March, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening—and saw the prisoner with something under his apron—I stopped him, and asked him what he had got—he said, a looking-glass, and a gentleman gave him a shilling to take it to the middle arch of Westminster-bridge—I asked him where the gentleman was—he said, "A little way back"—I asked him to go back—he went a little way, and then said he was gone—I took him to the station-house, and found Mr. Crisp, who lives about a mile and a-half from where I took the prisoner.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Did you go with the prisoner to Westminster-bridge? A. No, Mr. Crisp lives in Lower Sloane-street—the prisoner said he had been paid for his trouble, and showed me the shilling.





JAMES CRISP
. I am a broker, and live in Lower Sloane-street. This glass is mine—it was taken off a bedstead in my shop—it was there at four o'clock in the afternoon, when I went out—I returned late in the evening—it was then gone.

Cross-examined. Q. What time did you get home? A. About nine o'clock—I had not seen the glass for some hours.





WILLIAM DYKE
 (police-constable R 193.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former indictment, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace

of Westminster—I was a witness on the trial—I know he is the man—(read.)




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

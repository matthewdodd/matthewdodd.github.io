JAMES BALDWIN
. I am a paper-stainer, and live in St. John-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner was in my service about nine months—I discharged him on the 10th of July—next day I missed these spoons and sugar-tongs—I suspected the prisoner, and went to look for him—I found him in Old-street, and asked whether he had been past my house—he said he had not—I said, "Well, you will come home with me, my man"—he came home—I said, "Have you not any halfpence in your pocket?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Let me see"—he said, "No; I have not, only some silver spoons,"Which are my property, and which I missed—I must have lost them in the course of the night—I saw them safe at eleven o'clock, after the prisoner had left—I asked how he came into the house—he said he came in at the front-door, which was left open, but that was not true, for I had bolted and locked it, and it was safe when I got up—there is a work-shop down stairs, the window of which I found open—I believe he got in through the back-room first-floor window, which is very low—he knew the way to get in.

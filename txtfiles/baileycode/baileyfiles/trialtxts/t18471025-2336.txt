RICHARD SCOTT.
 I am a native of St. Helena—I am steward of the Prometheus—I arrived in London, and was paid 48l. 7s. 5d., on the 2nd of Sept.—on Saturday, the 4th of Sept., about two o' clock, I was near to Trafalgar-square—I

had seven 5l. notes, a doubloon, and four sovereigns—I was standing looking at the monument—the prisoner Saunders asked me if I knew whose monument it was—I said I did not know, but I rather thought it was Nelson's—he said he thought so too, from what he could see—he said he was a stranger in London—I said I was too—he asked me if I would go and look at Buckingham Palace—we went to Pimlico first, and saw the stables—he was admiring the stables for some time—he proposed going to a public-house—we went—I did not like the look of it—we came out, and we went to the Duke of York, kept by Mr. Harrison—we went up stairs—there was no one in the room—we had some bread and cheese, and a glass of rum and water—Saunders drank out of the same glass with me—while we were drinking, Cholm came in—he did not appear to know Saunders—he went and sat down at the farther end of the room—he drank by himself—he saw marked on the wall "Frome Ale," and he had some—he said he had beers over to New York, and had come back again to see about a fortune, that he had been to his lawyer and made it all right with him, and said he had received 40l.—he produced a green purse, which appeared to have, I should think, thirty or forty sovereigns in it—Saunders then said that there was some horseriding at Astley's Theatre, and asked me to go—I said I had been once to the theatre since I had been here, and did not care about going again—he said I had better go, it was a very fine sight—Cholm asked if we would accept of a sovereign each to buy a new hat—I said I never wore a hat in my life, and declined it—Saunders took the sovereign, or something in the shape of one, and recommended me to take one—he said I had better take it, a sovereign would not be amiss in one's pocket, but I declined it—Cholm showed his purse—he had it knocking about the table—Saunders then said I had better show my money, to appear respectable—I took out seven 5l. notes, and some gold—Saunders said, "As we are in a strange place, it would be better to secure our money"—there were three pieces of brown paper produced by one of the prisoners, and Cholm wrapped up his purse and money first, in brown paper, and put it into his pocket—he buttoned his pocket up—Saunders then wrapped up his money, which was loose—it looked like two or three sovereigns—he wrapped it in brown paper, and put it into his pocket, and buttoned it up—Saunders then wrapped up my money, as I supposed, in paper—I took from him what he wrapped up—I had no tobacco about me—there was some on the table—when I took the brown paper from Saunders, I was in the act of putting it into my fob—my trowsers were rather tight—I could not well get it in—Saunders said he would put it in for me—I gave it him, and as I thought, he put it into my fob—we left the house, and went on towards Astley's—when we had got eighteen or twenty yards, Saunders turned round and said he had left his handkerchief in the room where we had been sitting, and he asked me if I would go back and fetch it for him—I returned back, and was gone four or five minutes—when I got to the public-house, it struck me about my money—I did not go up stairs—I looked in my fob, and found, instead of the money, I had some tobacco rolled up in a piece of brown paper—I went immediately back, but could not find either of the prisoners—the road was straight along there—there were two or three lanes—if the prisoners had gone straight on at the pace we were going when I left them, I must have seen them, it was about half-past three o'clock—I went in a cab to the Bank to stop the notes—I have not had any of them back—I gave information to the police the same evening—I was taken by an officer to the station, where these men were, about ten days afterwards—they had not been pointed out to me when I went in—there were five or six persons there—I picked the prisoners out.


Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-five—I was born at St. Helena, and was at school there five or six years, till I was thirteen—I was then cellarman, at a wine and spirit merchant's, for six or seven years—I went to sea when I was nineteen or twenty, as steward—I have been at sea nearly six years—I was at St. Helena part of the time—I was on shore sometimes between three and four weeks—I afterwards got on board the Prometheus—I have never seen my notes, doubloons, or sovereigns since—I was quite sober—there were only the prisoners and myself in the room all the time—I have said that one of the men was a dark man with more whiskers than Saunders, more than he has at present—he looked different by having more whiskers when I saw him in the room than he had when I saw him at the station, and than he has now—he was not a darker man—I saw the prisoners first, after they were apprehended, at Rochester-row station—I was standing in a corner when they were let out—the policeman did not say, "Are these the two men?" to my recollection—I will not swear he did not—I knew the prisoners in a moment—I do not know what became of my notes, and doubloons, and sovereigns—I saw them put in paper—one of the prisoners must have taken them—there was no one else there—the doubloons and sovereigns were wrapped up in the notes—I smoke—I never use tobacco in any other way—I did not see any tobacco wrapped up—I had not been to any place before I met Saunders—I went to the Adelphi Theatre the first night I arrived—I did not lose any money there—I was paid at Woolwich, and then came to London—I had not been to Astley's Theatre—I went to the Adelphi with a shipmate of mine, not with any woman—on the 3rd of Sept. I went with my shipmate to two or three places, getting some little things—I did not ride about in a cab with two females—I was with one female belonging to the ship, and her husband.

COURT.
Q. Was it your own money? A. Yes—it was safe till I had it wrapped up.

Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTONE.
Q. You did not go into the first public-house that was proposed? A. We went in, but did not stay—it took us fifteen or twenty minutes to get to the second—I observed the first public-house was rather a filthy place—I went into the second public-house being struck by the appearance of it outside—it was a better looking house than the first—Cholm ordered his ale, and he moved from the further end of the room to the table where we were sitting, and brought his ale with him—Saunders and I were talking aloud—I was telling him where I had been, and Cholm struck in by telling me he had been to New York—I heard that the prisoners were taken, before I went to identify them—two policemen came to me, and said they had got two men—I went there next morning—the prisoners were both let out together—there were five or six other men there—they were not all policemen—I was not told to stand out of the way—I did not know the prisoners were going to be let out—they were the only two that were let out.

MR. PARNELL.
Q. If Saunders had more whiskers than he has now, has he the same amount of whiskers now that he had when you saw him at the station? A. Yes—he had made the change between the 4th of Sept. and my seeing him at the station—I have not the slightest doubt he is the same man—I had the seven 5l. notes in my hand the moment before the brown paper was produced.

COURT.
Q. How was Saunders dressed? A. In a beaver hat, a sort of plaid shooting-coat, and drab boots—he had not those clothes on when I saw him at the station, and he had lost some of his whiskers, but still I recognized

his person—I took particular notice of his voice before the Magistrate—it appeared the same as when he was in the room.





JOHN HARRISON.
 I am landlord of the Duke of York, in Vauxhall-road, Pimlico, about a quarter of a mile from Buckingham Palace. On the 4th, of Sept., about two o'clock, Scott came to my house with a person who I fancy was Saunders—he was a dark man with full whiskers, fuller than Saunders has got now—after they had been in a little while, Cholm came in, and went into the same room—I am positive of him—he ordered a glass of old ale—he was not sitting with Scott, but at the other end of the room—they were not talking together while I was in the room—I was in the bar when they came down, and went away together—Scott was quite sober—I had seen Cholm at my house before, and knew him by sight—I went to the station after the prisoners were taken—they came out alone, and I identified them—I cannot say how many persons were there.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. When the constable brought them out, he said, "Are these the men?" A. Yes—I was not sure of Saunders—I was sure Cholm—I saw them again three or four days afterwards, and he said, "Are these the men"—I said, "Yes."

MR. PARNELL.
Q. Were they shown to you twice? A. Yes—I had gives a description of them to the police, two or three days before they were taken.





CHARLES RIDGWAY.
 I am a tailor, in Webber-street, Blackfriars-road. Saunders lodged at my house about four months, with his wife—on Saturday afternoon, the 4th of Sept., about three o'clock Mrs. Saunders gave me warning that they were going away on the Monday—on Monday morning, at six o'clock, Mr. Saunders went into the country—Mrs. Saunders left on Monday evening.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. They had given you notice to leave before, over and over again? A. Yes—I was not surprised at their going—their place was taken by the week—they were at liberty to go by a week's warning.

COURT.
Q. Was Saunders an early man? A. He went out in general about nine in the morning, but that morning he went at six—he had gone out at six once or twice—I thought he was something of a coach-driver—on the 4th of Sept. he wore a green and blue plaid shooting-jacket—I forget what trowsers he had, but he had drab cloth boots and galoshes.





FREDERICK SHAW
 (police-sergeant, A 29.) I received information, and two persons were described to me by Scott and Mr. Harrison. On the 14th of Sept. I found the prisoners at Doncaster—when I first saw them Cholm was about twenty yards in front of Saunders—they then joined together—I apprehended them and brought them to town—I found on Cholm a pack of cards what are termed, "Longs and Shorts"—some are longer than the others—I found on him these two purses, a green one, and a brown one—there was 4s. 8d. in the green one; and in the brown one, forty-five pieces of brass having the appearance of sovereigns—I was at the station when the prisoners were shown to Mr. Harrison—he identified them—I had not said anything to him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. Did he speak positively to both of them? A. He did to Cholm, he was not quite sure about Saunders.

MR. PARNELL.
Q. Had you ever seen the prisoners together before? A. Yes, frequently—I saw them together on the 4th of Sept., between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on the parade in St. James's-park—I watched them for a quarter of an hour—I had seen them before that.


Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTON.
Q. When they were identified you took care they should have a fair chance? A. They were ordered by the gaoler to go across the yard—there were several persons about who appeared to have business with the Court—I told Scott we had two men in custody, and he was to come and see if he could identify them—he first gave me information on the Wednesday after the robbery.

COURT.
Q. You saw Saunders on the parade on the 4th Sept., and afterwards took him into custody, did you observe any difference in his appearance then? A. He appeared to have some of his whiskers taken off—he generally had full whiskers under the chin, and was differently dressed—on the 4th Sept. he was dressed in a dark plaid coat—a sort of shooting-jacket.

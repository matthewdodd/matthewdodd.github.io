            . I live in the house of 
               
                  George
                   Benson
               



            , in King-street, Golden-square


. On Monday the 20th of March, I went to bed about twenty minutes after nine, by my watch, and hung it up by my bed-side; my brother lay along with me. He got up before me, and said, William, where did you hang your watch last night? I looked and missed it. I never fasten my door. I found the prisoner, who lodged in the room under mine, did not lie in the house that night: he had a key to let himself in and out of the house. I took him up on suspicion.

             brought my watch to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's the next morning, who said he had it of the prisoner. When I first took him up, he offered me five guineas not to take him before the Justice. He owned he had had it, but would not tell where it was for five guineas.
Q. What is the prisoner?
Osmer. I think he is a writer for an attorney

            . I lodge in the same house, on the ground-floor; just before one o'clock that morning, I heard somebody go down stairs, and go to the door and unlock it and go out, and shut it after him, and lock it again; I cannot say who it was. I did not see the prisoner in the house that night.

            . On the 20th of March the prisoner came to me at my master's, Mr. 
               
                  Robert
                   Gordon
               



            's, in Charles-street, and told me he wanted to speak with me (he was in liquor); he told me, he was in some company last night; they were playing at cards, and he had bought a watch, and desired me to keep it and regulate it by mine. I asked, what he had paid for it: He would not tell me; but said, he had but six guineas the night before; and he pulled out five, and shewed them to me. I advised him, as he was in liquor, not to go to work, but go home and lie down. He left the five guineas and watch with me. About four in the afternoon he called on me again; he did not appear to be sober then. He desired me to keep the watch a little time, saying, he was afraid the fellow he bought it of had stole it; for he gave but a guinea for it. The next morning, between eleven and twelve, I heard he was taken up for stealing a watch. Then I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and delivered it up. (Produced in court.)
Prosecutor. This is my watch, my name is on the dial-plate ; I had it made so.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never had the watch; I know nothing about it.
He called Mr. Dalrymple, Mr. Gordon, and Mr. Urquhart, who said, they had a good opinion of him for honestly before this offence.

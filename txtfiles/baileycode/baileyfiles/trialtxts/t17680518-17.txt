                  Russel 
               



            , Esq; I live in Crutched friars


. On the 25th of March I and all my family went out of town to my country-house at Putney, leaving only Rebecca Brown at home; on the Sunday following word was brought me that my house in London was broke and robbed; I came to town that afternoon; I observed a horse with which we use to carry tobacco into carts, (it may be used as a ladder,) this was removed out of the cellar, and set up to a window up one pair of stairs; I thereupon went up stairs and found the door of a china closet broke open, which was locked when I went out of town; I missed out of my counting-house a gold laced hat which I used to ride in, and out of my dwelling-house several kinds of goods which I do not enumerate; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and gave him an account of what things I could recollect were taken away: he sent out bills; the prisoner was apprehended early in April; we found the hat, the silver nutmeg-grater, and silver spoon, (produced and deposed to;) the prisoner had lived two years some time before with me as a porter, and knew about the house, and I had great reason to suspect him.


                  Rebecca 
                  Brown 
               



            . I was the servant that was left in the house when the family went out of town; on the Saturday night I locked up the house, and left it about nine o'clock, and went to be with a friend's child that had the small-pox. About seven on the Sunday morning I came home, I found the street door double locked as I left it; I went into the kitchen, I found my gown and apron were gone which I had left there the night before, and the tea-chest was broke open; there was linen taken from my drawer, and a gown out of my chest; the window up one pair of stairs which the horse stood against was shoved open, which I left shut down at nine o'clock on the Saturday night. In 
               
                  William 
                  White 
               



            's room, the footman, there I found his chest broke open; then I sent word to my master and mistress at Putney, (two aprons produced,) these were taken out of the kitchen.


                  William 
                  White 
               



            . I am footman to Mr. Russel; (a pair of boots, plated spurs, a gold ring, several shirts, and surtout coat produced,) these I left in the kitchen; my coat was found at Stratford, these are my property.


                  Nicholas 
                  Simonds 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Black-friars. On the 13th of April, 
               
                  Anne 
                  Hemings 
               



             brought this gold ring to my house to pawn; it occurred to me there had been handbills from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , in which was a ring mentioned; I looked over the bills, but not finding that bill, I took it in of the woman; still it ran in my mind; I afterwards found that bill which described it; I went with the ring to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he advised me to wait till the woman came again; she came again and brought a sattin gown; I stopped her, and took her to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; there she gave information of 
               
                  James 
                  Manning 
               



             the prisoner.


                  Anne 
                  Hemings 
               



            . I carried and pledged the gold ring at Mr. Simonds's, and after that I went there with a sattin gown, and was stopped, (the gown produced and deposed to by Mrs. Russel,) I received the ring and the gown of the prisoner at the bar; the prisoner and I lived together at Chelmsford in Essex; he got up one Sunday morning about five o'clock and went out, having money owing him by one 
               
                  Michael 
                  Buck 
               



            ; he said he met with him, but he paid him no money, but he had given him a bundle to carry to the Red Cross at Stratford, and he was to come there in the evening; we went there and waited, but Buck never came; in that bundle was this gold ring and sattin gown.


                  Peter 
                  Peal 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. About the beginning of April a woman brought me a black petticoat, she said it was her own; on the 13th, the same woman brought a nutmeg-grater, the same that Mr. Russel swore to, (the petticoat produced and deposed to by Mrs. Russel.)


                  Richard 
                  Bond 
               



            . On the 16th of April the evidence was stopped at Simonds's, and brought to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's; she said she had all these things of the prisoner at the bar; I went by her directions to Chelmsford, and at the Crooked Billet there I met with the prisoner; I told him the woman had been to town with some goods and was stopped, and had given an account of him, and we were come in search of him, as there was a suspicion that he had broke Mr. Russel's house; when we came out at the door, the prisoner immediately ran away; we overtook him and secured him, and carried him back to the Crooked Billet; there we found some shirts and the gold-laced hat, the same as has been produced here; when we got him into the coach to bring him to town, he said he was not the first, and hoped he should be the last that was brought into a snare, but as to the woman no person could hurt her. The second time he was examined was on the 27th of April; there was farther discovery made; then I was sent down again to the Crooked Billet, there I found the boots and spurs belonging to White.


                  Joseph 
                  Stevens 
               



            . (Produced the silver tea-spoon.) This was delivered to me by Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             to bring here; it was found upon the prisoner at the bar, (deposed to by Mrs. Russel.)
Prisoner's defence.
On Sunday morning was seven weeks, I got up about half an hour after five, I was going to London, and to see my father at Stratford; I met 
               
                  Michael 
                  Buck 
               



             in Poorjury-lane, he asked me where I was going; I asked him if he had any money that he could spare me; he said he had none, but he would get me some; he asked me to carry these things to the Red Cross betwixt Stratford and Bow, and he would give me 18 d. I carried them and left them there, and had half a quartern of brandy, and left it to him to pay when he came for the things; I went home, and was asked if Buck had given me any money; I said, no; I said, I had got some things which he should not have till he gave me my money; this woman and I went there, Buck never came; I asked the landlord to let the things be there; he said it would be more convenient for him that we take them away, so I gave her one bundle and I carried the other; we took them home and kept them several days; he not coming, we opened them and took some of the things out; I believe Mr. Russel can give me no bad character for all the time I lived with him, please to ask him my character.
Mr. Russel. When the prisoner was my porter at first he behaved very well, but the last six or seven months he was with me, he behaved ill; I dismissed him, and ordered him never to come within my gates.




               Guilty of stealing the goods only
            . 


               T
            .
There was another indictment against him.

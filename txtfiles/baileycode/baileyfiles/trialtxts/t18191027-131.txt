            . I am a sugar-baker
, and live in Bedford-square. On the 6th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Featherstone-street, City-road


, and thought I heard footsteps behind me. I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw the prisoner retreating a few paces from me; he was stopped by a man, with the handkerchief in his hand - I took it out of his hand myself; he made some resistance. I took him into custody, called for an officer, and gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the street, saw it laying on the ground, and picked it up. The gentleman tore my shirt and waistcoat.

I live in Aldersgate-street, at the Aldersgate coffee-house


. On Saturday, the 3d of April, the prisoner was assisting my people in the business in the kitchen; he was an occasional assistant to my servants; on Sunday, I missed one spoon, in the morning, when I looked over them; my servants made enquiry, and applied to the constable; and the beadle came and informed me my spoon was at the pawn-broker's.

Did you ask him any thing about it? - He acknowledged taking it.

JAMES LAWSON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of January, 1 bridle, value 30s.; and one saddle, value 3l.; the goods of 



Samuel Harton.






SAMUEL HARTON
. I am an ironmonger, and live in Newgate-street. About the 5th of January the prisoner came and asked me to lend him a bridle and saddle, as he wanted it to try a horse for Captain Johnson in the Edgeware-road, and he would return it next morning—it was worth 5l.—he never returned it.





CHARLES GRACIE
. I am a saddler, and live in Cow-cross-street. The prisoner brought me this bridle and saddle, and asked me to boy them—I asked what he wanted for them—he said two guineas—I asked how he came by it—he said it was given to him by Captain Johnson—I asked where he lived—he said close by—I asked if he could take me to a reference—he took me to the Crown, in West-street—the landlord said he should not be afraid of buying things of him—he then took me to his lodging—I found it was a bad house—I then suspected him—he went back to my house—I shut him in, but could not find a policeman—at last he came out and said he would go with me to Johnson's, instead of which he ran away—I advertised the saddle, and the prosecutor owned it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





GEORGE LOCH
. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd, and searched him—I found no money on him; but several tailors' bills.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

JOSEPH GLENNY. I live in Wynatt-street, Goswell-road, and am a watch-case maker
. On the 11th of January, I went out, and about twelve o'clock I was in Fleet-market


 - I felt a pull at my coat-pocket, turned round and saw the prisoner with a taller boy - my handkerchief was in his hand - he was handing it to his companion who was behind him; the other seeing me, let it drop. I seized the prisoner and took it up - he begged me not to take him, as he would be sure to be transported.(Property produced and sworn to.)

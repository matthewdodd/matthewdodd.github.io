THOMAS BARTHOLOMEW
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of Sept., 2 gowns, value 15s., the goods of 



John Merryman; and the he had been before convicted of felony.






HARRIET MERRYMAN
. I am the wife of John Merryman, a baker, in King-street, Deptford. On the 11th of Sept., soon after six o'clock in the morning, I missed two gowns—one had been on a table, and the other is a box—I had seen them safe at half-past eleven the night before, in the room in which the prisoner slept—ours is not a lodging-house, but the prisoner came for something to eat, and asked if we could lodge him for a few weeks, till he got a ship—he left without paying his lodging, and did not come back—the gowns have never been found.





SARAH ELIZABETH SHINE
. I live in High-street, Poplar. On the morning of the 11th of Sept. the prisoner came to me, a little before eight o'clock—he threw a bundle on the counter, and asked if I would buy two frocks—I said, "Are they smock-frocks?"—he said, "No; women's"—I said, "Bring the women, and I will buy them"—he went away, came again about six in the evening, and said, "Mistress, come, buy this one; I have sold the other"—I opened it, looked, and saw it was a gown of the same kind as the policeman had left a pattern of.





ROBERT HILL
 (police-constable R 184.) I took the prisoner—I asked him if he knew a person named Merryman—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you know Deptford?"—he said, "No."

Prisoner. I never saw either one or the other of them.





MICHAEL GARVEY
 (police-constable R 87.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

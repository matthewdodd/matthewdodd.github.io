John Chaplin. I am servant to Mr.

            , who provides me with hats, cloaths, &c. On the 29th of August the prisoner came into the pew at church where I sat. I saw him take my hat off a pin, and push out. I followed him out of church. He perceived me, and drop'd the hat. I called out, Stop thief, and he was taken about a hundred yards from the place. He said he thought it to be his own, but he had got his own with him, and endeavour'd to hide it, by putting one into the other. He beg'd I would let him go, and said he'd make it up the next day, if I would let him know where I lived.
Prisoner's defence.
He'll say any thing and't please your lordship. I was at church, and at the end of the service I saw a young man whom I had not seen for a long time before. He was going out, so I followed him, and instead of my own I took another hat.

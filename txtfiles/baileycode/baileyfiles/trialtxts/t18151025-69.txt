            . I did not see the prisoner come into my shop; but while we were sitting at tea, I saw the jar move from the counter; I fancy he came on his hands and knees. I ran out of the parlour directly, and pursued him down Stewart's rents; he then threw the jar away, and dashed it to pieces. I ran as far as the court after him; then the watchman took up the pursuit, and stopped him. There was nobody running but the prisoner and the watchman.

            . I pursued the prisoner, and took him, and there was a mob wanted to rescue him.

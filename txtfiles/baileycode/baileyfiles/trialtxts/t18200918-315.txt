            . I am a sailor
. On the 17th of September, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I was in King David's-lane


, going to a fire there; as I passed over the shafts of the engines, the prisoner and three others stood against the wall - they came behind, pushed me along, and as I turned round, whipped my watch from my fob. The prisoner was nearest to me - he got behind two others. I seized him, and the others ran off.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You did not see him take it - A. No, but he was one of them, and he was the nearest to me; the others were not near enough to take it.

            . I am a headborough. The prosecutor siezed the prisoner, and gave him to me; he said
"I have not got your watch, search me." I saw two others with him.

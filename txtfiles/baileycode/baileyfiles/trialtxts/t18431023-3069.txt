HENRY JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of Oct., 2 pewter pots, 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



William Coomber; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM COOMBER
. I am a licensed victualler, and live in Dorset-street I swear these two pewter pots are mine—the prisoner had no right to take them.





JOHN HADDOCK
. I was going down Harley-street last Wednesday evening—I saw the prisoner stoop down an area and take a quart pot—he put it into his pocket—he went into the Park, took it out, took a knife out, stooped, and appeared to be cutting it—he then returned, and took two pint pots from an area—I gave information to an officer.

Prisoner. Q. What are you? A. A labourer—I have worked for Mr. Grant, a coachmaker in Hatton-garden—I have been convicted of potstealing myself.





WILLIAM JONES
 (police-constable D 59.) I received information, and took the prisoner—I found on him these three quart pots and these two pints.

Prisoner. Haddock was the person who induced me to do anything of the kind; and he was on this very occasion after the same property; if I had not taken it he would.





JOHN SPIERS
 (police-constable D 142.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 48.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

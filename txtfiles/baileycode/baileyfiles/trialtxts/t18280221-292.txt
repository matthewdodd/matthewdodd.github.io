            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 23d of February, at ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came to pawn this shawl for 4s.; 1 suspected it was stolen, and asked where she had got it; she said she had just bought it at Messrs. Nichols for 6s.; but as there was a ticket marked 16s. 6d. on it, I detained her.

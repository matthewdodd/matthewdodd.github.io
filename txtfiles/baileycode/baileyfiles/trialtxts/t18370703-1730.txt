JOSEPH THORP
. I keep a cheesemonger's-shop at East Sheen, in the parish of Mortlake. I keep a Wednesday, at a quarter before ten o'clock, my shop door was opened, and the prisoner came in—I heard a bustle, and saw the cheese fall—I pursued him to the door, and he ran off—the patrol came up—I told him—he pursed him, and brought him back with this cheese in his possession—he is the same person I saw go out of the shop—this is my cheese—it is worth about 9s. I had seen the prisoner about before.

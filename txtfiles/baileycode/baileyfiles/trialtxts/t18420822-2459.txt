JOHN POWER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of August, 3 3/4 lbs. weight of bacon, value 2s., the goods of




John Cousins; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM HOMAN
. I am shopman to John Cousins, a cheese monger, in Mary-le-bone-lane. On the 19th of August I received information, and ran out—I saw the prisoner with this bacon in his hand—I brought him back—this is my master's bacon—I had seen it safe five minutes before.

Prisoner. You never found it on me. Witness. As soon as I took you threw it down—there were two men in your company.





JOSEPH NIFTON
 (police-constable D 118.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read) the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

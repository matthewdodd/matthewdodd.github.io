            . I missed some loose iron on the 10th of May, that I had picked up at different times, and laid in a manger; upon enquiry after it, I was informed where there were some pieces of iron; I went and saw it, and was sure it was mine. (The iron produced, and deposed to by the prisoner.)

            . I have known the prisoner twenty years. I saw him on the 10th of May in the fields, between Bromley and Limehouse; he came to a turn-style, where there were three ways; he did not go directly through, but went and hid a bundle which he had under his arm, then he went away, and I saw him endeavouring to hide himself; I went and took up the bundle which contained the iron that has been produced.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found this iron when I was digging; I suppose it had been hid by somebody. I have not been in the prosecutor's stable these two years.

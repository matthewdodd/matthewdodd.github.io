ISSAC POWELL. I keep a glass coach
. On Sunday, the 29th of January, my coat hung in the harness-room in the stable, at the Ship tavern, at Tottenham


 - I put it there about one o'clock, and locked the room up; the prisoner was in the stable at the time. About six o'clock I found the door broken open and the coat gone.

            . I was standing by the stable, and saw the prisoner leaning over the pales, and looking roundthe yard; he stood there a few minutes, then left, and went towards the stable, and came through the gateway with a large coat rumpled up loosely. I went round to meet him, but could see nothing of him - I am certain I saw him with the coat; I knew him before.

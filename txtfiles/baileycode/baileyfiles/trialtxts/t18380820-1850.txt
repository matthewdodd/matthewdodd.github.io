WILLIAM MADDOCK
. I am a captain in the army, on half-pay. On the 9th of July, I was walking in Church-street, Soho, at half-past eleven o'clock at night—the prisoner came and took my watch-immediately he snatched it, I called out, "Stop thief"-a policeman pursued and took him—I lost sight of him immediately—he was taken in a few minutes—the watch is mine—I can swear to it—the policeman called to me and said, "I have him," and I went up to him—I will swear he is the person.

Prisoner. I did not do it—I was waiting for my brother.





THOMAS WELLS
 (police-constable C 99.) I was on duty, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—I pursued him, and

saw him throw a watch down an area—I took him and got the watch—I showed him and the watch to the prosecutor.

Prisoner. I did not do it. Prosecutor. I am quite sure he did.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

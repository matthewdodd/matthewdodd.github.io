CORNELIUS DONOVAN
. I live in Holy well-street, Strand, and am a winemerchant. I put an advertisement in the paper for a servant—the prisoner came as such, on the 11th of November, and gave a reference to the matron of the Westminster Hospital—I went down in the kitchen about six o'clock, and asked her if the matron could be seen then—she said, "Yes "—I went up stairs, and was preparing to go to the hospital, when I heard the balldoor close—I went down, and found the prisoner was gone—I missed my cloak, which I had seen safe that morning—this is it—(looking at it.)





FELIX HILLER
 (police-constable E 122.) I was on duty on the 12th of November, in Regent-street, and took the prisoner in charge for another felony—she had a bundle—I asked what was in ft—she said, a cloak that she had bought in Petticoat-lane—I found this cloak in it.

Prisoner. I bought it six months ago in Petticoat-lane.





CORNELIUS DONOVAN
. It had been in my possession several years, and there is a particular mark on it—I have not the slightest doubt of it.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—

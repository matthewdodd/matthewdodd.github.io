EMILY ELLWOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, at 

St. James. Clerkenwell, 1 watch, value 5l 15s; 1 seal, 2s; 1 watch-guards, 2s 6d; and 1 key, 6d; the goods of 



William Ashley, in his dwelling-house; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM ASHLEY.
 I live at No. 37, Clerkenwell-close, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell; it is my dwelling-house. On or about the 12th of Feb. the prisoner came to my house—I left her in the kitchen—I was—away for about two minutes, then came back, and missed a silver watch, a guard-chain, key, and black ribbon—the prisoner was gone—she had given me her address, "Mr. Smith, Elder-walk, Back-road, Islington, opposite Cross-street"—I went there with a policeman, and found she did not live there—I gave information at Bagnige-well station—not two minutes elapsed between my seeing my watch safe and missing it—I am positive no one but the prisoner could have taken it; no one else had been in the room.





RICHARD MAJOR.
 I produce a watch which was pawned on the 13th of Feb. by a woman—I have a slight belief it was the prisoner, but cannot swear to her.

Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I beg for mercy.





GEORGE BOARDMAN
 (police-sergeant E 16.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 23rd Feb, 1846, of larcency and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . I was in Guildhall


, on Monday the 30th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock. Mr. Payne came up and bid me feel in my pocket if I had not lost something; I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; he said if I would follow him he would shew me the man; I turned about and saw Payne had seized the prisoner by the collar; he took him up into the hall, and threw him down on his back; the handkerchief was concealed between his waistcoat and his breeches, (produced and deposed to.)

            . I was at Guildhall. I observed the prisoner some time; I suspected him and watched him narrowly. I saw the prisoner put his hand into somebody's pocket; he turned away and seemed to be tucking something into his breeches. I went up and asked the gentleman if either of them had lost a handkerchief; the prosecutor felt in his pocket, and said he had; I went and throwed up the prisoner's heels, and I took the handkerchief from under his waistcoat, tucked into the waistband of his breeches.

I picked the handkerchief off the ground.

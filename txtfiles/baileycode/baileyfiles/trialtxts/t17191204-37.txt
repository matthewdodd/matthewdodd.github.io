             on the 4th of September
 last. It appeared that Humphrey came to the Prosecutor's handsomly drest to take a Lodging, that Mrs. Yates told him they had one to let, but it would not be ready till Tuesday. He said it would be a great Detriment to him if he had not one that Night, for he had been engaged for a Friend for 10 l. who was run away, and could not go home for fear of the Officers; at last it was agreed that he should come that Night, and be brought the Prisoner with him as his Wife, who appeared in such a mean and draggled Condition, that she had a suspicion of them; that she lockt her Doors and took what care she could of her House that Night; but so soon as her Husband was up and gone to work in the Morning, they went away with the Goods: that when the Prisoner was taken about three Weeks ago, she offer'd to make it up. The Jury found her 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

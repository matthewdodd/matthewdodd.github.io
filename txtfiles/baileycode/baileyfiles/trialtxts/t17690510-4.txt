            . I live in Nightingale-lane, East-Smithfield



. I lost a silver pint mug on the 12th of April. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             to get it advertised, with a guinea reward. Sir John told me I need not offer that, he thought they might find it without. I went with one of Sir John's men; we found the mug in Angel-alley, Long-Acre, up two pair of stairs, in Carryl's lodging-room, between the sheets of her bed, with the bottom taken out. ( Produced and deposed to.) Medley was apprehended and committed to Clerkenwell Bridewell. I went there to him; he confessed he took it, and said he was drunk when he took it. The mug cost me four pounds, three shillings and six-pence.

            . The prisoner came to our house and called for a pint of beer; I drawed it; he insisted on having it in a silver pint that he had engraved for us. I put his liquor in one. After he had drank the beer he never paid for it; but put the pint under his jacket. I saw him do it as I was serving a customer with a pennyworth of gin; but I did not think he intended to go away with it. He got off with it.

            . The prosecutor came to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             and said he had lost a silver pint mug the night he had lost it. We went to some houses in St. Giles's where he supposed Medley frequented, but could not find it. After this, I was told by 
               
                  Esther 
                  Peters 
               



            , that 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Carryl 
               



             had bought it for twenty-two shillings. The prosecutor was sent for. He and I went to her lodgings in Angel-court, Long-Acre. Carryl went by the name of Whinny Madding. We met a girl in the court: when I spoke to her, she ran back and said, O Whinny, what have you done! Here is this silver pint mug come to light! I said, I imagine the mug is in the room. The man that belonged to the room took his hat and walked out. I turned up the coverlid of the bed, there lay the mug. I saw the prosecutor's name upon it. He took it in his hand and said it was his proper.


                  Esther 
                  Peters 
               



            . 
               
                  Peter 
                  Medley 
               



             came to an alehouse where I use, and asked me if I could shew him where he could sell this mug. I shewed him where Carryl lived. They had a dispute about the price; she would give him but a guinea; he asked twenty-two shillings for it; at last she gave him twenty-two shillings out of her own hand.
Medley's Defence.
She never bought any mug of me at all. The last evidence is a common prostitute.
Carryl's Defence.
I have witnesses here to my character.

            . I have known Carryl about two years. I know nothing of her but what is good.

            . As I was coming along Leather-Lane


, the 28th of June, I saw that honest Man at the Bar there, taking a Firkin of Beer off 'Squire Green's Dray.'Twas Small Beer,- I don't justly know the Value of it, for I did not belong to the Dray. I thought the Prisoner had no Business with the Beer, so I said to him,''Friend you don't '' belong to the Dray, you had better let the Beer alone.'''' I am only going to carry it a little Way, says he, and so he took it away. Upon this I called in at Mr Green's Yard , and told his Men; they went after the Prisoner, and took him.
Thomas Lovelage. Hill called to me in the Yard, and told me, a Man was taking a Barrel of Beer off the Dray: I went after the Prisoner, and just as I came to Hatton Wall , I saw he had pitch'd the Firkin of Mr Green's Beer , upon a Bench. When I took him, he said a Man was to give him a Pint of Beer , to carry it to the Place where he had pitch'd it.
Prisoner. There was a Man at the Dray, who promised me a Pint of Beer to carry it to the Farrier's Shop. and there leave it. 

               Guilty

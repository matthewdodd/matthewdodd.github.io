NEAL M'INTIRE. I went home with the prisoner, to her lodging, in West-street, Smithfield


. I slept with another girl; the prisoner was in the same room. I awoke in the course of the night, and missed my silver watch from under the pillow; the girl was still there, but the prisoner was gone; she appeared the worse for liquor. I was sober.

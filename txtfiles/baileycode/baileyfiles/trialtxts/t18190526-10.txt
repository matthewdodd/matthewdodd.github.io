            , who is a hosier, and lives in the Poultry


. On Saturday evening, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner lurking about the door for sometime; while I was busy serving a customer, I saw him make a snatch, and take away two parcels of stockings - he ran across the road, and up Grocers'-hall-court; I pursued, calling Stop thief! he turned round, saw me, and dropped them. I picked them up, and followed him up Dove-court - the officer stopped him without my losing sight of him - I am positive he is the man.

            . I was at the end of Dove-court, and saw the prisoner running very fast; he was stopped. I took hold of him; Baldwin came up, and said he was the thief. He wanted me to let him go, and begged for mercy. I told him it was useless to beg pardon if he had done nothing - he still begged for mercy.

            . I live with my father, in the City-road- he is a bird-stuffer. On the afternoon of the 16th of January I was by the turnpike, in the City-road, and saw the three prisoners - Willshire took out of a broken pane of glass, in the prosecutor's shop window, a handful of cigars, and put them into Cosson's hat; then Cosson took some, and put them into his hat; some fell on the ground, and Mealey took them up.

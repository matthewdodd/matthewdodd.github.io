WILLIAM DAVIS
 and 




WILLIAM HOLMES
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
20th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



William Howarth from his person.






WILLIAM HOWARTH
. I attend to the coal business for my mother. On the 29th September, between three and four o'clock, I was in St. James's-street—the officer came and said, "This man has robbed you"—I missed a silk pocket-handkerchief—the prisoner Davis, was taken, and Holmes was on the other side of the way.





STEPHEN OWENS
. I saw Davis pick this gentleman's pocket—the other was on the side of him at the time—I sent my shopmate out to tell the gentleman.

Holmes. Q. which side was you on? A. On the left when the robbery was committed, close to you, and on the right you were taken.





WILLIAM MASON
 (police-constable G 15.) I received information from a lad that Davis had picked the pocket, and gave the handkerchief to the other—I took Davis, and Donovan took the other.





TIMOTHY DONOVAN
 (police-constable G 107.) I was present. The prisoner Holmes passed by us, the lad said, "That man has the handkerchief in his hat, there is a corner hanging out"—I followed, and took his with it—he took the hat off himself, and said he had nothing in his hat but his own handkerchief, and tried to conceal this handkerchief, which is the prosecutor's, under his own—I found this other handkerchief is his pocket, and this one on his neck, and this pencil I took from him, which he said he bought.

Davis's Defence. I was proceeding down St. John-street—the policeman came and took me—I walked to the station-house, and saw this prisoner, whom I had not seen before.

Holmes. I never saw that young man before.

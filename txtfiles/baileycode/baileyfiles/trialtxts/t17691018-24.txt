            . I live in Fox-court, Brook-street, and am a shoemaker
. On Monday evening I was coming down Fleet-street


, when a woman was in fits at the door of Mr. Parker's. I stopped to look among other people, and in the mean time I felt something at my pocket. I turned round, and saw the prisoner with a pair of shoes in his hand, which I had in my pocket just before. I seized him; he made an attempt to get away; I took him down to a fishmonger's shop, and a constable came and took him down to Bridewell.

            . I was coming down Fleet-street, and saw the prosecutor have the prisoner by the collar. I took him in charge. (The shoes produced, and deposed to.)

I was going along, and saw a pair of shoes on the ground. I took them up. I live at the back of St. Clement's, at Mr. Watson's.

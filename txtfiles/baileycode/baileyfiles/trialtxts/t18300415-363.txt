WILLIAM HOLLAND. On the 19th of March I went to Smithfield


 to select a horse, and while trying him in a cart I was pushed about, and felt a pull at my pocket - I put my hand, and missed my handkerchief, which I had safe five minutes before; it was then half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner was going towards the pens- I followed, and took him; he was doubling up this handkerchief, which is mine.

            . I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor on the 19th of March - he rolled it under his apron, walked away, and the prosecutor took him with it.
Prisoner. It was ten minutes before they took me.
MR. HOLLAND. I took him directly they came to rescue him - one man said he was an officer, but I would not let him go.

            . I am a taylor
, and live in St. Luke's Place. I lived in the Minories


 when I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; which is now almost two years ago: the prisoner lay with me. I left him one morning in bed, and went to work; when I came home at night the things were gone out of my box, which was broke open; the lid was split and the hinges burst open. I never saw the prisoner again till last Sunday night but one; he then owned that he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment, and had sold them in Rag Fair, and said he hoped I would be favourable.

            . The prisoner and the prosecutor lodged together at my house. He gave me the key one morning, and went out with a bundle. He came back again about three o'clock and went up stairs; he came down again and gave me the key and went out. I saw him no more till he was taken up; when Lewis came home from work and went up stairs, he said he was robbed.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had nothing in the bundle but two shirts of my own; and one pair of stockings. I owed a little money which I could not pay; that was the reason of my going into the country to work.

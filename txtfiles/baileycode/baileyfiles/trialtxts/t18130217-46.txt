            . I live at Hackney


. My mother keeps a cheesemonger's shop in Church-street. I keep a poulterers shop
, as a perquisite to myself.
Q. When did you lose this fowl - A. On the 27th of January, the prisoner came into the shop between five and six in the evening. She asked for some butter, and during the time I was serving her she went to a shelf where the fowls laid. There was three on one shelf, and four on the other. She took one from the shelf.
Q. You did not see her, did you - A. I did not. I missed it, and I accused her of taking of it. She denied it. I looked under her cloak. I heard it fall behind her. I immediately went round. There I saw it lay by the side of her. We then sent for the constable. She offered to pay four shillings and sixpence for it if we would let her go.

Q. Do you know anything of her - A. Yes, she has been here before. She lived at Temple Mills.
Prisoner's Defence. I never touched the fowl, nor saw it until it was shewn me.

Charles Wittingham. I am a poulterer
, and the prisoner was my servant
. I live in Thieving-lane, Westminster


. On the 14th of May, my wife and I went to Clare-market to see my brother and sister; before I went out I had taken four guineas and put them along with some more in a bag, in my drawer in the kitchen, I told the whole, which was twelve moidores, three 36 s. pieces, and seven guineas. We came home at about eleven o'clock at night. I was taken ill coming home, so went to bed directly. I got up next morning to go to market, I went to the drawer and it was open, the money and bag were gone.
Q. Was the drawer lock'd when you left it before?
Wittingham. I cannot say whether it was or not: The prisoner being missing I went to his wife that morning and ask'd where he was, but she did not know. I found him in St. James's-market on a horse he had bought that morning; I took him off the horse, he fell down and lay some time, but would not speak; I search'd him there and found ten moidores, one 36 s. piece, five guineas, seven shillings, and a penny; I took him home, then before Justice Lediard, he confess'd there he took the money out of a drawer of mine.
Prisoner's defence.
I am a young man that has had a great deal of trouble with a young woman which I lately married, she was brought to bed about six months ago; I had no money to support her and my brains were turned, and between whiles I am not in my senses.

Joanna Lewis. I keep a Shop in the Great Ambry [Almonry] Westminster


 ; I desir'd a Woman to watch my Door while I went Upstairs, I had not been gone up long, when it seems the Prisoner came to this Woman, and ask'd her if she had any Check; upon which the Woman call'd me down, but before I came the Prisoner was gone, and had taken this Piece of Check with her. She was pursued, and brought back in less than a Quarter of an Hour, with the Goods upon her.

            . As I was standing at my own Shop Door, I saw the Prisoner go up to a Woman at the Prosecutor's Door, and ask her if she had any Checks? The Woman said she did not know, but would call the Mistress of the Shop, and so she went in, and the Prisoner after her, and in a Moment the Prisoner came out again, and run away with the Check I sent 2 Boys after her, and follow'd my self, and kept my Eye on her till she was taken.
The Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

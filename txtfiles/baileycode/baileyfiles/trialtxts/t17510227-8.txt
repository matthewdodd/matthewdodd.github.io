            . On the 30th of January, about 7 o'clock at night, as I was going along Newgate-street


, I catch'd hold of the prisoner's arm, just as he had taken my handkerchief out of my pocket: one corner of it was in my pocket. He drop'd it down directly. I kept hold of him till I had him secured. The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to. My relation,

I never touched his handkerchief. There was a great crowd of people, and they laid hold on me by mistake.

            . On Saturday last, betwixt eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I was going along Fleet-street


; a gentleman told me my pocket was picked of a handkerchief, and the fellow that did it is got off, but the prisoner then had it; upon which, I laid hold of him, and found it concealed under his coat. I took it from him, and got a constable, and took him to the Mansion-house.

            . I saw the prisoner receive a handkerchief from a man that took it out of the prosecutor's pocket, and when we got him to the constable, he confessed he received it from a person that had picked a gentleman's pocket. He was asked his name? he said he did not know him, any farther than that he was a Jew.
Prisoner's Defence.
Going up Fleetstreet, a young fellow went before me, and happened to pick the gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief, and dropped it on the ground; I took it up, and had it under my coat.

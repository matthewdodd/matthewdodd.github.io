            . I was opposite the north door of St. Paul's cathedral


, about two o'clock, on the 19th of July - I felt a pressure on my pocket, looked round, and saw the prisoner transferring my handkerchief to a companion, but he dropped it on the pavement, and I took it up; this is it - it is mine; I am quite sure the prisoner dropped it - I had used it a minute or two before.

            . The prisoner was detained, and the property given to me.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, denying that the handkerchief was ever in his possession, or that he was behind the prosecutor, but stood before him.

            . I have the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, on Thursday, the 9th of April, in the 10th year of the late King's reign; he was twice whipped and confined twelve months in the House of Correction; I know he is the person.

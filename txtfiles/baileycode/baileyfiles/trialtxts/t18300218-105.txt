            . On the 23rd of January the prisoner came into my shop, (which is a pastry-cook's,) for some cakes - I was serving him; he came round the counter, and took a bowl of copper - he was pursued and taken- the bowl was thrown into the road; I am sure he is the boy.
WILLIAM PITMAN. I took the prisoner with the bowl in his hand; I fell down, it being frosty, and the bowl was thrown into the road - I got up, and the prisoner was taken without my losing sight of him.

JOSEPH CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, on Thursday, the 14th of January, in the 10th year of His present Majesty's reign; I took him, and know he is the lad.

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of February, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Thomas John Cooper.






THOMAS JOHN COOPER
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Clark, a dentist. On the 22nd of February, at a little after nine o'clock at night, I was going along Oxford-street—I received information, and missed my pocket-handkerchief—one of the officers produced it to me—this is it.





JAMES KENNERLEY
 (police-constable C 30.) I was on duty in High-street, St. Giles. I saw the prisoner, and watched him into Oxford-street—I saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, but he took nothing from there—I still followed him—he went after Mr. Cooper, who was walking with two gentlemen—he took his handkerchief from his pocket—I told Mr. Cooper, and my brother officer took the prisoner.





JAMES FOWLER
 (police-constable C115.) I was with Kennerley—I did not see the prisoner take the handkerchief, but I saw him run away—he threw down the handkerchief, and I took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. I am a hard-working boy, as you may see by my hands.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Park.

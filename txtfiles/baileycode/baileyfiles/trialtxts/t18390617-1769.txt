1769. 




HENRY TUCKER
 was again indicted

 for forging and uttering a request for the delivery of 3 bib cocks and 1 spindle valve, with intent to defraud 



Joseph Wheeler.






EDWARD BASTIN PAGE
. On the 5th of April the prisoner brought this order, signed, "J Simpson, for Mr. Smith, No. 38, Great Castle-street"—I delivered him the goods in consequence of the order.





ROBERT JOHN SIMPSON
. This order is not signed by me—I do not know whose it is—the prisoner had no authority from me, or any of the firm, to get these goods.





GEORGE THORNTON
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and on the way to the station-house I asked him How he came to do such a thing—he said, "I own I have acted wrong, but if I am allowed time my friends will settle it."




GUILTY of Uttering. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were 8 other similar charges against the prisoner.)

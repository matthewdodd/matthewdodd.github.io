            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Kerby, who lives in High-street, Poplar


. I remember the prisoner coming to the shop on the 30th of April. I went out, and he was running away with another man - he had a blue apron on, and was holding it up, as if something was in it. I saw him throw the prints out of his apron. I was close to him, and saw him drop them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

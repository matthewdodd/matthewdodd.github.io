JOHN KEBBLE
 and 




JAMES PEBBLE
 were indicted for

 stealing 9 scarfs, value 4l., the goods of 



William Higgins and another; and that they had been previously convicted of felony.






WILLIAM OWEN
. I am shopman to William and Thomas Higgins, of Bond-street—we sell scarfs, &c. Both prisoners have been in the habit of coming to the shop—I saw them early in Feb., and after they bad been there I missed some scarfs—I believe all these produced to be my master's—this one I know by a cut—I believe alt the others to be theirs.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did not one of the prisoners buy the one that you know by sight? A. No, he did buy one—I know this most particularly by the cut—I had seen the men on the premises before Feb.—these scarfs were taken at different times—they might have been taken at one time without my knowing it, but I should think not.





ARTHUR NORTH
. I produce a scarf pawned by James Keppel on the 10th of Feb.





WILLIAM BOWN
, assistant to Mr. Rochford, pawnbroker, Brewer-street, Golden-square. I produce nine scarfs, one pledged by James, on the 22nd of March—the others were taken by our young man—I am certain he is the person.





JAMES HARMAN
, pawnbroker. I produce three scarfs. The prisoner James pledged one by himself on the 12th of Feb.—the second time, the 15th of Feb., they were both in company, and pledged two scarfs, but which took the money I cannot say.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect the two coming together? A. Yes I do, on more occasions than this.





JOHN FREDERICK SIMMONDS
. I produce two scarfs pledged by the prisoner James on the 22nd of Feb.
(property produced and sworn to.) GEORGE GATIER (police-constable F 23.) I produce a certificate of both the prisoners former conviction—(read)—they are the persons.

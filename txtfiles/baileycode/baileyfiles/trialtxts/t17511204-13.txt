I ran up the back stair case, I took hold of the door that leads to the stair case, I believe a minute or two, there came the prisoner at the bar down from the two pair of stairs, she said she had been up to a gentleman for some linen to wash : I drew her apron aside, there I saw three of my own, and two of my fellow servant

            's shirts. I took her before Mr. Fielding, and she was committed.

I am a market woman in Covent-Garden, I met a gentleman, he desired me to go up to his room, I did, he gave me these shirts, the prosecutor met me, I told him such a man had given them to me and was gone down stairs, so they took me and brought me before the justice.

            . I am servant to Mr. William Patterson, who is a shoemaker
, and lives at No. 1 and 2, Broadway, Westminster


. On the 30th of August, between seven and eight o'clock, as I was opening the shop, the prisoner came and asked for a pair of leather boot-laces, I said I could not cut them; he went away, saying it would do when I had opened the shop. He returned in half an hour, had one, and a pair of silk shoe-strings, which came to threepence; he then left the shop; and in about a quarter of an hour I was tying up some shoes, and was going into the shop No. 2., I saw him come out of the door with six pair of boots; on seeing me he threw them down, and ran out; I overtook him in York-street, he said
"I have got nothing, what do you want with me?" I did not see him take them - they are worth 30 s.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I took these boots off a nail, intending to buy them for my wife. He said I intended to steal them, and I went away.

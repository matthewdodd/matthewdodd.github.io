            , a pawnbroker
. On the 28th of May a pair of shoes were taken from about half a foot within the door; a person might get them by getting on the step - there are two steps; I heard the noise, went round, and saw the prisoner with them; I took him directly.
Prisoner. The shoes were given to me by a boy. Witness. There was no other boy.

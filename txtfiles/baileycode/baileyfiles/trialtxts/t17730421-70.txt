            . I am a Baker
 in Wood-street; my wife keeps a shop in the New-road, above Moorfields



; on the 23d of March between twelve and one o'clock my daughter came and informed me that there were two persons in the shop that had stole some lace; I went there directly and found 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbot
               



            , and Phenie Francis in the shop; my daughter sent to one Mr. Coast and he brought an officer with him; we insiste on their being searched, and they were by Mrs. Edwards, Mrs. Jones, and my daughter; I was not in the room at the search.


                  Elizabeth
                   Elliot
               



            . I am daughter to the prosecutor: I live with my mother; Phenie Francis and 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbot
               



             came into my mother's shop, on the 23d of March, between twelve and one o'clock, and asked to look at some lace; I shewed them a good deal, but they said there was none to suit them; I thought I missed a piece, and desired them to stay while I looked; looked and missed a piece containing 8 yards, worth 9 s. 6 d. a yard; they were for going, I desired them to stay while I sent for an officer; they did very quietly; I sent to Mrs. Edwards next door, and she sent her boy for one; the officer came and told us we might search them; we went into another room, and Mrs. Edwards, Mrs. Jones and I searched them; we did not find any thing upon either of them; I saw Phenie Francis have that piece in her hand to look at; I did not see it afterwards; before they went out of the shop, when we could not find it upon them, they threatened to consult a lawyer to have satisfaction, as we had had satisfaction upon them; then Mr. Coast advised me to carry them before a Justice. I gave charge to the officer, and he took them directly; we went to Justice Wallford's, in Bunhill-row; he was at dinner, so we went to the York Minster a public-house; while we were there 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbott
               



             looked out at the window, and said her sister was going by; she threw up the sash and called to her, that was 
               
                  Kitty
                   Brian
               



            ; she came to the window and a young man with her; 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbott
               



             desired the young man to go to her mother to let her know she was there; soon after he and her mother, 
               
                  Mary
                   Abbott
               



            , came into the room where we were; then we went to the Justice's, and 
               
                  William
                   Chandler
               



             saw 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbott
               



            , as she going along hand something to Brian, and he was going to take it from her, and handed it to M ary Abbott. Mr. Coasts took it from 
               
                  Mary
                   Abbot
               



            ; I did not see this myself; the parcel that was taken from 
               
                  Mary
                   Abbott
               



             was produced before the Justice.


                  William
                   Chandler
               



            . I was at the York Minster with the prisoners: I went with them from there to the Justice's: at the public house as we were drinking, 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbott
               



             looked out of the window, and said there goes my brother and sister; she threw up the sash and called the Irish girl over, and told her she had been at a person's house to buy a piece of lace, and they missed a piece, and she desired the young man to go to her mother; with that 
               
                  Mary
                   Abbott
               



             came and was very much frightened, and seemed to faint away; as we were going to the Justice's 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbot
               



             pulled out a blue and white handkerchief, and the lace hung down; I said to Mr. Coast there is your lace, such a person has it; with that she went to put it in her pocket; Coast laid hold of her hand; she made a sham to wipe her nose with the handkerchief; says Coast what have you got here? she said nothing at all; he said I am sure you have something, and held fast hold of her hand going into the Justice's; the passage was very narrow going in; some how or other she got her hand from him, turned round and delivered it to the old woman the mother; the old woman followed so close she did not perceive it; I believe she dropped it; I do not know whether it was in her hand; the lace and handkerchief were both dropped; Mr. Coast picked it up.


                  John
                   Coast
               



            . 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Elliot
               



             sent for me the 23d of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon; 
               
                  Ann
                   Abbot
               



             and Francis were there; she charged them with stealing a piece of lace; I went to the York Minster; when we came out to go to the Justice's, Chandler, said Coast, Abbott has given a bundle into Bryan's hand; I said then it shall not go any further; but however going into the Justice's, the young man that was with Bryan rushed between us; I pushed him back; but however she got her hand from me, and put it to the old woman; I looked and found the bundle under the old woman's cloak; I do not know whether she had it in her hand or no; as soon as I took it I held it up, and the lace hung from it (produces the handkerchief and the lace); the lace was sealed up before the Justice: it has been in William Hewit's custody ever since.


                  William
                   Hewit
               



            . That parcel was delivered to me at the Justice's; he gave me orders to keep it.
Coast. I am sure that is the parcel I took from 
               
                  Mary

            . I am an officer: I was sent for to Mrs. Elliot's, when I came I insisted on their being searched; they were, but nothing was found on them then; I went to the York Minster, and from thence to the Justice's; I never saw the lace till it was shewn at the Justice's.
Q. to Coast. When you took the handkerchief from 
               
                  Mary
                   Abbot
               



            , was the lace done up in it?
Coast. Yes.

            's Defence.
I was going along Wool-pack-alley on a Tuesday, I cannot say what day of the month; going down the alley, I met Phenie Francis; she asked me to take a walk with her; I went home and put on my hat and cloak, and we went over Moorfields, and came to this shop; she asked me to go in with her to buy some lace; I did; the gentlewoman shewed her some; she said it would not do; she shewed some more, and by and by the gentlewoman said there was a piece missing, and came round and asked if it was by us; I said if she had a mind I was willing to be searched; Phenie Francis would not without a constable; one was sent for; and I was searched three times; they could not find any thing then; they took us before the Justice; going to the Justice, Phenie Francis came up and said Bryan desired her to give the handkerchief to Mrs. Abbott.
Phenie Francis's Defence.
I never gave her any thing; I know nothing of it.

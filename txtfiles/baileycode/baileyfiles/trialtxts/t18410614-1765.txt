1765. 




CHARLES BOLTON
, and 




JOSEPH SAUNDERS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
2nd of June, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Henry Peter Fowinkel, from his person.






HENRY PETER FOWINKEL
. I am in the employ of a merchant, and live at Pimlico. I was walking in Church-street, Greenwich, on the night of the 2nd of June—my attention was called to my handkerchief by the constable—I felt in my pocket, and it was gone—it was a white cambric one—I had it safe a very short time before—the one now produced is it.





JOHN EATON
 (police-sergeant S 193.) I was on duty in Greenwich fair on the 2nd of June—I saw the two prisoners and another one, not in custody, together—I saw Saunders try a great many pockets, and the other one too—they were walking and talking together, and each trying several pockets—they followed the prosecutor out of the fair into Church-street—I saw Saunders go behind him, put his hand into his pocket, and take the handkerchief partly out—he moved a few paces away, and then Bolton went and pulled it out completely—I laid hold of him—he immediately threw the handkerchief on the pavement, and I picked it up—Saunders ran away—I am satisfied that Bolton has been led away by others—he bore a good character before.





WILLIAM RUSSELL
 (police-constable C 113.) I was on duty in Greenwich

fair, and saw the prisoners—I saw Saunders go up to the prosecutor, put his hand into his pocket, and take his handkerchief partly out—he then stepped back, and Bolton took it out—I attempted to take Saunders, but he ran away—I followed him some distance and took him.
(Bolton received a good character.)

JEFFERY SHORES. I was at the corner of St. Paul's



church-yard last Friday, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I felt a tug at my pocket; I found my handkerchief was gone - I turned to the left, and saw the prisoner- I said, "You have my handkerchief;" he said, "I have not;" I turned him round, and saw it in his breast pocket.
Prisoner. I said I had picked it up. Witness. You did not say so to me.

            . I was at the corner of Paternoster-row on Friday evening; I saw the prosecutor take the prisoner by the collar, and take the handkerchief from his breast-pocket, or his breast, and I went up and took him.

            . I was on duty, and the prisoner was delivered to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along St. Paul's church-yard, and kicked against the handkerchief; I took it up, and put it into my pocket - the gentleman asked me if I had picked his pocket; I said No, I had picked up a handkerchief - he opened my coat, and took it from my inside, not my breast-pocket.

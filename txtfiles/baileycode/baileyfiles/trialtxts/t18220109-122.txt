            . I am an officer. On the 31st of December, I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoners in company with another, in Holborn - they made several attempts at different doors - we watched them for three quarters of an hour, as far as Mr. Dowlman, in Clare-market


. The one who has escaped, took a piece of bacon from the window, and gave it to Conner. Simmonds was standing round the corner, watching. They all ran away - we pursued, and took Conner. He threw it down. I met Simmonds, who said,
"Have you got him, Sir?" I took him.


                  THOMAS 
                  THOMPSON
               



            . I was with Keys; his statement is correct - they were all three in company.

                  DOWLMAN
               



            . I am a cheesemonger. The bacon is mine - I was reading the newspaper in the shop when it was taken.

CONNER'S Defence. I was distressed - and when it was given to me, I was taking it home.
SIMMONDS'S Defence. I saw them running away, and waited to see if they were taken.

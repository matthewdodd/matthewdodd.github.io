            : we live at Queen's-buildings; the prisoner was our servant
, and boarded and lodged in the house; we make up our accounts every quarter, and then we settle with our servants; but if they want money in the mean time, they ask, and are never refused: the prisoner came into the service in March last, as a weekly servant, and was accustomed to receive money, and to account for it immediately he came home, or not to let the day pass over; Clark was a customer, and I considered he owed me a great sum of money.
SAMUEL CLARK. I am a butcher, and deal with Messre. Slater and Main. I paid the prisoner for his masters, between the 16th of August and the 8th of December, at sixteen payments, 24l. 11s. 2d. - he received the money weekly, and these are the receipts which he gave me for it; on the 8th of December, I paid him 1l. 6s. 3d., and this is the receipt.

JAMES SLATER. The prisoner never accounted to me for one penny of this money; I had not spoken to him on the subject, but it was his duty to come and pay it, which he never has done; we make up the accounts at the end of the year; when I accused him of receiving this money, he said he had not received it.

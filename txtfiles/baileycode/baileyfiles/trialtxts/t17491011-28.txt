             was indicted for

            . I live over the way from the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner squeeze by a hogshead, and put his hand into the prosecutor's shop, and take out a bundle, but could not alarm the people time enough to take him: I described him so near, that they brought two persons to me in such like clothes, neither of which was him; afterwards the prisoner was brought, and I am certain he is the man.

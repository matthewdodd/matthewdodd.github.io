 was indicted

for stealing 8 farthings, the monies of 




Priscilla Lupton; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






PRISCILLA LUPTON
. I am a widow, and keep a shop in Cross-street, West-moreland-place, City-road. About a quarter before four o'clock on the lst of Dec., I was sitting in my parlour, at the back of my shop—I saw the prisoner in the shop—I got up to serve him, and saw him leaning over the counter, with his hand in the till—I screamed—he took his hand out, dropped eight farthings on the counter, and ran out—he never spoke a word—(there was more money in the till)—I ran out, and cried, "Stop thief"—he was taken by my neighbour—I went back to my shop, and picked up the eight farthings—I went to my till, and missed about eight farthings from it—I had seen my money safe not five minutes before—the prisoner was brought back to my shop—I am certain be is the person.





WILLIAM SILVAY
. I was in Britannia-street, where I live—I heard the cry of, "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run past me—I ran and caught him—he asked what I wanted him for, and said he had done nothing—a mob collected, and the people said, "We had better take him back to the shop"—he was taken back, and Mrs. Lupton identified him.

Prisoner. I was standing at the corner of the City-road. Witness. No, you was running as fast as you could—it was as much as I could do to catch you.





JOHN BROCKLEBANK
 (police-constable N 334.) I took the prisoner from Mr. Silvay—I got these eight farthings from the prosecutrix.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to meet a young man; I was walking with my hands in my pocket, and the witness stopped me.





GEORGE HORNER
 (police-constable N 229.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

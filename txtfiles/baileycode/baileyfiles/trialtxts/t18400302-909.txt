MESSRS. CLARKSON, BODKIN, and DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM CARNE
. I am in partnership with my brother Edward Clifton Carne, as merchants at Falmouth; we are agents to the Brazilian Company. On the 18th of March last year, the Sea Gull packet arrived at Falmouth from the Brazils—two boxes of gold dust were consigned to us by that packet—I never saw the contents—I saw the boxes, they were marked B. C. 18, B. C. 19—they were seventeen or eighteen inches square, and made of wood, fastened together with nails—there was no cord round them—they were sealed with red wax—I observed that they were nailed, which is not a usual thing with the Brazil boxes—they were always screwed previous to that—those two boxes were shipped on board the City of Limerick steamer, for London, by my directions—(looking at the paper marked No. 1)—this is the bill of lading, referring to them—they were consigned to the Brazilian Company, at the Bank of England—Messrs. Hartley and Co. are the agents for the steam packet company that the City of Limerick belongs to—we transmitted in the usual course of business a copy of the ship's manifest of the City of Limerick to Messrs. Hartley and Co.—this is it (looking at No. 2)—I forwarded it by post on the 23rd of March—it would arrive in London on Monday morning, the 25th—the postage from Falmouth was 1s. at that time—it is addressed to James Hartley and Co., John-street, Crutchedfrairs, and bears the London post-mark of 25th March—(The following extract was read from the manifest.—"Consignees, Brazilian Company—where for—Bank of England, B. C. 18, 19—Goods; two boxes of gold dust, value 4640l.; freight 6l. 3s. 9d.")—the effect of that would be, to transmit these boxes to the Bank of England on account of the Brazilian Company—this letter (No. 3) is not my handwriting, nor the hand-writing of any person in our firm—it was not written by our authority—it is altogether a forgery—this letter (No. 4) is also a forgery in all its parts—this (No. 6)—is a genuine letter, written by a clerk in our office, and transmitted to London on the day it hears date.

Cross-examined by
MR. JONES. Q. Is your clerk here? A. No; his name is Hugoe—I think he invariably writes these letters—I received the boxes from the commander of the Sea Gull—on his bringing them to our counting-house I put them in a place of security at my own private house—I did not leave it to Hugoe to transmit them to London—Jordan was the person who took them on board the steamer—I did not go with him—I had not had any communication with the prisoner previous to this transaction—I had seen him occasionally at the office in London—I had not sufficient communication with him to enable me to judge whether he was a person well skilled in mercantile affairs—I had seen very little of him.

Q. Who usually signs the letters you write to Messrs. Hartley? A.


When the manifest has been sent, the signature has been, "for W. and E. C. Came and Co.—GEORGE HUGOE." Sometimes one partner writes letters and sometimes another; but the manifests are often made up at a very late hour at night, and and we very rarely sign them—I never put my name to them myself.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are the letters you pronounce forgeries, of the band-writing of Hugoe or any clerk, or any partner.? A. Nothing like it—not any one of them.





ROBERT JORDAN
. I am clerk to Messrs. Came of Falmouth—on the 22nd of March I shipped on board the Limerick two boxes, which came by the Sea Gull—marked, "B C" 18; "BC" 19.

Cross-examined. Q. To whom did you deliver them? A. To Capt. Moffett.





JOHN MOFFETT
. I am captain of the City of Limerick—I was on board when she came from Falmouth on the 22nd of March—I remember receiving on board from Messrs. Carne, two boxes, brought by Jordan—they were kept in the money room, under the cabin—the Limerick arrived in London on Sunday, the 24th, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—the boxes were landed on Monday morning, about ten o'clock—they were the boxes referred to in the bill of lading which I brought up with me in the ship's box—this is it—(looking at No. 1)—I took the boxes on shore myself at the Iron Gate wharf, and put them into Messrs. Hartley and Co.'s office, on the wharf, as near as I can calculate about ten o'clock—the wharf is close to the Tower—between the Tower and St. Katherine's dock—I then went to the counting-house of Hartley and Co, in John-street, and saw the prisoner attending there as Mr. Hartley's clerk—I told him I had landed the boxes of specie at the wharf—he said he would go down and attend to it himself—the boxes were in the same state when I took them there as when I received them—they were marked "B C 18 and 19."

Cross-examined. Q. What time did you arrive in the river? A. Between three and four o'clock, as near as I can calculate, on the Sunday—I knew Francis Allen, a clerk in Messrs. Hartley's office—he came on board our vessel on the Sunday, about ten or twenty minutes after we arrived—no other person came on board from Messrs. Hartley's office—he did not come to me with a message from Mr. Hartley—he had no business on board as clerk to Messrs. Hartley—he could have none on Sunday—he merely came on board to see me, I suppose—he frequently came on board ship on our arrival—I knew him very well—I did not know him better than any of Messrs. Hartley's clerks—I was on a friendly footing with most of them—the other clerks were in the habit of frequently coming on board when the ship arrived—he did not make any inquiry as to what I had on board—to the best of my knowledge I did not tell him—I might have said I had specie on board, but I think not—he came into the cabin to me—the boxes were in the room under the cabin—I never mentioned any thing to him about the specie, to the best of my knowledge—I might have said I had specie on board, but I cannot charge my memory—he might have remained down in the cabin twenty minutes—I was taking refreshment—he came down, and might have stopped twenty minutes, bid me good day, and went away—I did not see him alter he went on deck—he was the only person connected with Messrs. Hartley's establishment who came on board on

Sunday—I did not tell him I was going on shore with the specie in the morning—I had no conversation with him respecting the cargo, of any description—I might have said I should he coming on shore in the morning, and might perhaps have said I should be at the wharf in the morning, but I cannot charge my memory.

Q. Do you believe you told him you were going to take the specie on shore in the morning? A. No—I really believe, to the best of my knowledge, I never mentioned to him, in any way, about specie being on board—I believe I did not mention any thing about the boxes—I cannot swear it—the first time I saw the prisoner on the subject, was on Monday morning at the office in Crutched-friars—I have not seen Allen lately—I believe the last time I saw him was the latter part of April—it was the second voyage after the robbery—I saw him in the office at John-street, and have never seen him since—I have heard that he left Mr. Hartley's employment very suddenly.

Q. Do not you know that he left the employment immediately on Moss being in custody? A. I was not in London then—I went to Dublin—I believe Moss had not been taken before I went to Dublin—I do not know that Allen went to America immediately after leaving Mr. Hartley's service—I know nothing about him.

MR. BODKIN. Q. What time did he go on shore after coming to see you? A. He left me between four and five o'clock—about four o'clock—I did not see him on board any more that day—I found the boxes perfectly safe next morning—he had no opportunity of getting to the ship's papers to know what the cargo was—the boxes were kept in a strong room under the cabin-floor, which was locked, and I found it locked.





JOHN MARTIN
. I am a lighterman. I remember The City of Limerick steamer coming in on the 24th of March, and on the next day I took the ship's box containing the papers, to the Dublin Steam-wharf, Iron-gate—I took it there about seven o'clock in the morning, or a little after, and left it there.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect who you saw there? A. The foreman.





JOHN VINCE
. I was a labourer at Iron-gate-wharf, in March last. On the 25th of March I remember seeing the ship's box of The City of Limerick steamer, and took it to Mr. Hartley's office in John-street, about eight o'clock in the morning, and put it on a wash-hand-stand there.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive it from Martin? A. No—Mr. Kingston had the care of it.





HENRY MOSS
. I am of the Jewish persuasion. I know the prisoner very well indeed—I worked for his father—I have known the prisoner I think about seventeen or eighteen years—I was foreman to his father, and left him on being married—I was a watch-maker by trade, and after I was married, the prisoner for a short time came to me to learn the watchmaking business of me—for about six months before the 25th of March last, I was in the habit of seeing him often—I did not exactly know what service he was in—I knew he had a certain engagement connected with the Steam-company—I remember going to Ellis Caspar's house in Finsbury-pavement, about the October previous to the 25th of March last—I was invited by Mr. Caspar to call there—we went to the synagogue together—while there the prisoner came in, and we all three left the synagogue together—Ellis Caspar asked me in the prisoner's presence, to come and see

him, saying that he wanted me—I said I should call at some opportunity—at that time I was living at No. 12, New-street, Mile-end—Ellis Caspar knew where I lived, and on the Sunday following I found him at my house when I got there—the prisoner was not with him—he made a communication to me, in consequence of which I afterwards met him at Williams's coffee-house, in St. Martin's-le-Grand—we ultimately went to Charing-cross together to a coffee-room there—the prisoner came there—there were two or three strangers in the room—the prisoner said he wanted to speak to me, but not in the presence of strangers—we walked out together into St. James's Park—it was then dark—Ellis Caspar was with us, and he said to the prisoner "Lewin, I have brought Moss; I have not told him any thing what you wanted with him, now tell him the business"—the prisoner said he wanted me to do him a favour, that was to call at his office, and bring a letter which his father would give me, and he would give me a box, which I was to take away and give it to his father—I asked him what the box was to contain—he said he did not know, it was to oblige a friend of his in the country—he said probably stones, but it would make no difference, I should be satisfied for the trouble and loss of time I might sustain—I made some objection, and he said it was such business a ticket porter might do, only he did not want his father to be seen in the business—he told me there could be no blame, if any, all the blame he would take on himself—the prisoner told me I was to meet his father at a coffee-house opposite the Monument the following morning—he said it in his father's presence, so that he could hear it—I was to go there about ten o'clock—I went, and met Ellis Caspar—he said when I met him that he would go and see Lewin—he left me to go and see for him—he returned in a very few minutes, and brought the prisoner with him—Ellis Caspar had a paper in his hand—the prisoner said the ship he expected the box to come by to him had not yet arrived, and he desired me, as I had lost so much time, to go home and call again in the afternoon—I went again in the afternoon to the same place opposite the Monument—I saw Ellis Caspar first, and he went and fetched the prisoner, who said the ship had arrived, but two of their ships had come in collision, and there was a great deal of damage done to them, and the ship could not be unloaded, the box which was for him was at the bottom of the ship, and could not be unloaded till next morning—we met next morning at the same place—the prisoner said he thought his friend had made a fool of him, for the box his friend had sent was too heavy for any person to carry—I asked him if it could not be fetched in a coach—he said, "No," he did not wish it to be fetched in that way, as he was afraid the coachman might know his father, and he did not wish his father to be known in the business—he gave me half-a-sovereign on that occasion, and before we separated he asked me where I could be found when he wanted me—he and his father walked a little way, then turned to me, and said they should not want me then, and asked me where I was to be found—I said I was always to be found at my employer's—I was then in the service of Mr. Joshua Hyams, a watchmaker, whose service I have been in ten years—I am not now in his house, but I work for him—the prisoner objected to send there for me, and asked, if I was not at home, whether I should be found if he directed a note for me, and he told me he should direct a note, not in his own name—we then parted—we afterwards met in Finsbury-square, very shortly after, a few days, perhaps a day or two after—the prisoner came to that meeting, and Ellis Caspar too—we met in the

square—I do not precisely recollect what passed, but I recollect it was not on the business of taking away the box—it was some other business—we had several meetings of no importance—at one time of meeting the prisoner asked me what kind of hand I wrote—that was at least four months before the 25th of March—I wrote my name and address on a piece of paper that the prisoner had in his pocket, and handed it to him—he said that would do admirably, and asked me if I would write for him two forms of letters that he would give me—I was to copy two forms, and give them to him—he lent me a letter, and said that hand-writing I was to imitate as nearly as possible—he lent me the letter for that purpose—I recollect the contents of that letter perfectly—I did not return the letter to him immediately I had done what he requested—I kept it by me till the day before the 25th of March, when the prisoner came to my house, I then gave it to him—this is the letter—(looking at No 6)—I mentioned my recollection of the contents of it before the Magistrate, before the. letter was shown to me—I had a recollection of the contents of the letter, before it was shown to me before the Magistrate—after that letter was given to me, two forms were given to me by the prisoner—I cannot exactly recollect when, but it was a considerable time before the transaction took place, some months—I copied them, and returned them to the prisoner, with the forms—I made two copies, because the first he said the ink was too pale, and the paper would not do—he destroyed them in my presence—there were spaces left to be filled up—I wrote a second copy for him—these two letters (Nos. 3 and 4) are two of them—I wrote those two forms, but the date was not there when I wrote them, and several other words have been inserted, where I left blanks—they now read as perfect letters—they were mere skeletons at first—the date was not in, nor the words "William Marsh, Esq., agent to the Brazilian Mining Co., or order, freight and charges paid, two boxes, B.C. 18 and 19"—the initials and subscription—the date was not in the second letter, (No. 4) nor "William Marsh, Esq., or order, Secretary to the Brazilian Mining Company"—that is not my writing, nor the word "Limerick"—I wrote "City of"—I rather think that is my writing—no it is not—"City of Limerick" is not my writing—"on board" is my writing—"W. and E. C. Carne" is not mine, nor "boxes shipped by us marked B. C. 18 and 19"—"Mr. Bristow, please deliver above, Messrs. Carne have advised me about them.—L. CASPAR," is not my writing—there is no address to this letter—when I gave it to him it was directed to L. Caspar—here is part of the "er" on it now, where it has been torn—I directed it to Lewin Caspar—I should think it was more than a month before Christmas that I did this—(looking at No. 3)—this is a letter directed "Hartley and Co., 16, John-street, Crutched Friars, London"—hat is my writing—I wrote that according to the form—I directed the other (No. 4) to Lewin Caspar himself, by his own desire.

Q. After this did you see any thing of Lewin or Ellis Caspar again, before the 24th of March? A. Yes—I only saw Lewin—I did not see him more than twice I should think between that period and the 24th of March—on the 24th of March I met Ellis and Lewin Caspar in Turner-street, Commercial-road—they were coming to my house—Lewin desired me to knock at the door, as he did not wish my servant to see him, and he stood on one side while the servant opened it—that was where I lived in New-street—he went there with me—I knocked at the door, and let them both in—Lewin then said he should want me to-morrow—(this was

Sunday, the 24th of March)—I told him I had business I Was obliged to transact that morning, and did not think it would be convenient for me to come—Ellis Caspar said it would be a very good excuse to me to be out, at I told him I had out-door business to do, and he said the business would not occupy many minutes—I agreed to meet them I think in Mark-lane—I was to meet both I supposed—I went to Mark-lane, about ten o'clock next morning, and met Ellis and Lewin Caspar together, I think in Fenchurch-street—as I was going along, Lewin Caspar left his father, and Ellis Caspar came up to me, and said something to me, and we went together into a house in Mark-lane I think—he gave me a letter there, and a blue bag at the same time—the letter was folded at that time, and the address was torn off as it is now—I went the same day with that letter in a cab, to Mr. Hartley's office, in John-street, and delivered it to the prisoner there—this receipt, which is written across the letter, is my hand-writing—I wrote that on it at the wharf, when I went there for the boxes, after I had been in the City about my own business—I was asked to write a receipt on the letter—I had to deliver an order for my employer for twelve lever watches, and I received 50l. on account—this is the cheque I received that morning—(looking at No. 9.)—I signed my name across it as an acknowledgment of it—when I received the letter from Ellis Caspar be told me what to do with it—I took it to Mr. Hartley's office in John-street, in consequence of what he told me, and inquired for Mr. Hartley—Lewin Caspar was sent out to me—I was in the cab then—I handed him the letter—he went into the office, leaving me in the cab—he came out again with the letter I had given him, and another one which he compared together—he put his hand inside the cab with the two letters, one in each band, and examined them.

JURY. Q. How long was he before he came out? A. Not above a minute or two.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he say any thing on comparing the two letters? A. He said there was a mistake, and asked me to step out into his office, and he would correct it—I got out and went through the front office into the back office on the left hand side—there was nobody there besides me and him—I observed clerks in the outer office which I passed through—when we got into the inner-room, the prisoner made some alteration, in one of the letters—I cannot say which, nor what the alteration was—the words at the bottom of this letter, "Mr. Bristow, please deliver above. Messrs. Carne have advised me about them.—L. CASPAR," was written by the prisoner while I was in the room—this is the letter, part of which I had previously written at his request—he then gave me the letter to go to the wharf—he wrote the direction of the wharf I think on another part of the letter—here it is on the back, "Inquire for Mr. Bristow, Dublin Steam Wharf, Irongate"—he told me to go to the wharf, and get these things, and he should be there as soon as me—he told me I should have to give an acknowledgment on the letter, and told me not to write my own name, and told me some name that I was to write, but which I forgot in the interval while I had been about my own business—it was in Bread-street that I was to deliver my master's goods—I went there, and from there to the wharf—I got into another cab to go there—I discharged the first cab somewhere by the Globe Insurance Office—I cannot precisely recollect where I took the other, but it was close on the same spot—I went to the wharf, and inquired for Mr. Hartley—I think one of the porters came to me, or somebody about the office—I afterwards saw Mr. Bristow.


Q. Why did you inquire for Mr. Hartley? A. I thought probably he might be at that place, though not at the other, as the clerk who first came out at John-street, said, "Mr. Hartley is not here, but the agent is"—I was in the cab when Mr. Bristow came out to me—I gave him the order the prisoner had given me—MR. Bristow desired me to come into the office—I went in and saw two boxes there—MR. Bristow said, "These are the boxes, will you take them with you?"—the porter placed them in the cab I came by, by Mr. Bristow's desire, and I gave him 1s.—I then wrote this receipt on the letter, and left the letter with Mr. Bristow—I put one of the boxes into the blue bag, which Ellis Caspar had given me—it was not large enough to hold both—I was desired to meet Ellis Caspar in Wood-street—I went there in the cab, but he was not there when I got there—I went to the Cross Keys public-house, Wood-street—the boxes were taken out of the cab by one of the porters there, without being directed to do so, and put on the counter, supposing I was going by one of the coaches—not finding Ellis Caspar there, I wanted to get a cord to tie the boxes together to carry them, but could not get one—I got another cab, put them in, and drove to my own home near the London Hospital with them—I drove to the London Hospital, Mile End-road, near the corner of Turner-street—the man by mistake drove me past the turning at which I intended to get out, which was the corner of Turner-street, and took me to the next street, which is at the corner of the hospital—I then took out one of the boxes, and went home with it to No. 12, New-street, and left the other one in the cab—I put it in my bed-room—I came out with intent to fetch the other, and met Ellis Caspar in the street—I told what I had done with one box, and where the other was—in consequence of what he said to me, I got into the cab again, and was driven to the Commercial-road, merely to delay the time—that was in a direction from my house—it was to avoid my own house—the box was still in the cab then—I ultimately took the second box to my house—I had at that time a servant named Jane Bradley—I got out of the cab at the end of Commercial-road, discharged the man, and returned by the omnibus—I got home about eight or half-past eight o'clock—I had tea, and went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house, which is in the neighbourhood—Jane Bradley fetched me from there—on going home I found Ellis Caspar waiting in the front parlour for me—I had a conversation with Ellis Caspar about the boxes, and he then told me what they contained—the servant did not sleep at the house—she went home after some time—it was very late before Ellis Caspar went—I sent the girl home some hours before he went away, rather before the usual time, by Ellis Caspar's desire—I desired my wife to send her away—there was a fire in my back parlour—I went up into my bed-room with Ellis Caspar, and showed him the boxes—they were taken down stairs to the back parlour—there were seals on all four sides of each of the boxes—Ellis Caspar put the lid of one box on the fire—I lent him a chisel to get the cover off, that was the wooden cover, they were secured by nails merely as a packingcase—after that box was opened there was a tin box enclosed—there was a quantity of hay between the wood and the tin.

Q. What was the box broken for at first? A. It was by desire of Ellis Caspar to divide the contents into smaller portions—the tin box was considerably smaller than the wooden one—upon finding that, the contents were not divided—there seemed then to be no necessity for it—the other box was opened in the same way—the outside cases of both were burnt, every morsel,

and the hay Ellis Caspar took away in his handkerchief—he went away before the boxes were quite burnt, and after he was gone 1 took the tin boxes up into my bed-room again—as near as I can recollect, they were about as large as three of those octavo books, (pointing to them) and about six' or eight inches long—I opened one of the tin boxes—it contained lumps of apparently ore of various colours—they had no appearance of gold—I had never seen gold in that state before—the sizes varied very much, some were larger than others—the largest was not larger than a child's fist, or a moderate sized orange—I placed the boxes in my bed-room that night, put them in brown paper, and tied them round with packthread, to make them appear as parcels—next morning I put them into separate trunks, one into a black leather trunk of my own, and the other into a wooden trunk of my daughter's which had no lock on it—I corded it—the following morning I seat my wife to hire apartments—that was in consequence of what passed between me and Ellis Caspar.

Q. Well, where were the tin boxes with the ere in them afterwards taken to? A. To Mansel-street, by my directions, and from thence by my sister—they were afterwards taken, I believe, to Petticoat-lane, and from thence the ore was brought to me at Oxendon-street, where I was then concealed—I had not the boxes at Oxendon-street—the ore was taken out of the boxes before it was brought to me—the last time I saw the tin boxes was at my place in Mansel-street—it was to Davis's house in Oxendon-street that I went.

Q. What became of you after this? A. I went to Brentford for two days, and afterwards to Peckham, to Fishwick's—I never saw the prisoner after that—I remained at Fishwick's a fortnight, and then surrendered to the officer—I supplied myself with the lodging at Fishwick's—I saw nothing of the prisoner at Davis's house—I did not take the ore to Davis's—it was brought to me out of the boxes—I desired Davis to go for it to my sister's, in Petticoat-lane—I told him they were there, and he said he should fetch them—I delivered up some money to the officers when I surrendered—I received that money from Davis—it was notes—I. think it was 140l.

COURT.—Q. Do you know of your own knowledge what became of the ore? A. Only what I was informed of—I never saw it after it was taken from Oxendon-street—I did not receive the 140l. till nearly a fortnight after—it was given to me by Davis in the coach as I was coming here to surrender myself—I do not know what has become of Davis—I saw him once at the office.

JURY.—Q. Did Davis know you were coming to surrender? A. Yes, when he gave me the 140l. he came with me—I came here for that purpose—I have been in that dock" and was afterwards discharged—I do not exactly know what may be termed a discharges—it was last Monday—I was discharged on the same day.
Mr. CLARKSON.—Q. Do you know Fiestel's coffee-house, in Tower-street? A. Yes—I was there with the prisoner, it night be a month before this transaction—I cannot state exactly—I left a handkerchief there—(looking at a handkerchief produced by Roe)—this is the one.
Mr. JONES
to Mr. CLARKSON.—Q. Have you known it happen that there have been mistakes in the manifests, the bills of lading, and letters written at your house? A. I never knew such an instance—I have no recollection of letters having been written to correct errors which have been made.

Q. Was your receipt of these boxes from the captain of the sea Gull


the first intimation you had of it? A. We received letters the day before with the bill of lading.





HENRY MOSS

Cross-examined. Q. Had you worked for the prisoner's father in his house? A. Yes—I did not board there—I had ceased to work for him for some time before this subject was mentioned to me—I had done nothing for him for many years—when I used to meet any of the family we recognised each other—we were very seldom in the habit of visiting each other.

Q. For how long before the subject was mentioned had you visited at Caspar's house? A. I cannot say—I sometimes called in at his shop, perhaps it might be a year before, I cannot exactly remember—I know at one time Mr. Caspar asked me to do a job for him, when I met him by accident.

Q. While you were in his service did you ever have to write? A. No, I had no occasion to write—I never had to make out invoices, or enter in any books, nothing of the kind.

Q. Do you mean to swear up to the time you mention, Lewin Caspar did not know what sort of hand you wrote? A. I do not think he possibly could have known—he might have seen me writing at his father's—I might have made some little marks—I cannot tell what he knew, I only know he asked me to show him what sort of hand I wrote—I am perfectly persuaded he could not know what sort of hand I wrote—he was very young when I was in his father's house, and might forget what hand I wrote, if I did write there—I will swear that I do not know he knew what hand I wrote—I might occasionally have sent in accounts to Ellis Caspar in my own hand-writing—I have no recollection of having written a letter to him since I left him, but I will not swear it.

Q. How many different statements have you made as to the part you took in this transaction? A. I never made but one myself—the statement made before was made for me, and not by me—the first statement, which was false, was suggested to me by Davis and Mrs. Abrahams, when they visited me at Peckham—that statement was taken down in writing—I wrote part of it myself, and gave it to Davis—I had some conversation with Davis while I was writing it—Davis dictated to me what I should write—Lewin Caspar's name must have been mentioned in the course of that conversation.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you write what Davis dictated? A. Yes.

COURT. Q. Had you any conversation which was not reduced to writing? A. I do not know what the conversation was precisely—I only know that by his dictation I wrote down what I did—I have no hesitation in saying Lewin Caspar's name must have been mentioned.

MR. JONES. Q. You had conversations with Davis on the whole subject? A. Yes—I have no doubt the prisoner's name was mentioned in those conversations—I have no hesitation in swearing it—it is impossible to swear exactly, but I believe it was—I will swear, in conversation with Davis, I did mention the prisoner, at that conversation when I was writing my statement—I was never asked that question before to-day—I gave that statement to Davis, or Mrs. Abrahams—they were both together—Davis is my wife's father-in-law—he married her mother—I do not like to own him myself, he is not quite so respectable as I could wish—he keeps a good many b——y houses—I never lived in any of them—I have been in one of them—that was in Coventry-court—I had never been there before—I have no doubt

that was a house of that sort—I went from Coventry-court to Oxendon-street, a house I had never been in before—I went to Coventry-court on Thursday morning, and left there the following Tuesday morning—I have not seen Davis since I saw him at the police-office—he has left the country—I believe he was afraid of being taken in custody for this—I was in custody myself for several months—I made a statement to Mr. De Mole when I surrendered myself, at the inn over the way—that Was the first statement I made myself—that was besides the one 1 wrote at Davis's dictation—I made a third statement while I was in prison—the second statement I made, as near as I can recollect, corresponded with the first, and was equally false—the third was truth, and nothing but the truth, that I know of—I believe it contained what I have sworn to-day—it was in Writing—I do not believe I read it over after I Wrote it—my sister, Mrs. Levy, and my wife, were also taken into custody on this charge—nobody else connected with me, I am quite certain.

Q. Now, when the prisoner told you he wanted you to do him a favour, did you ask him what it was about, to know if it was right or wrong? A. I did.

Q. You would not Have done what was wrong? A. If I was to assert that I should not be believed, in my present situation—I thought I was not doing wrong, but I scarcely expect that to be believed—when I went to the office I did not think I was going to steal 5000l. worth of gold-dust, or I certainly would not have done it.

Q. I suppose you have been very much surprised to find you committed a felony by it? A. It was a surprise at first—I have not got over it now, I shall never get over it, my feelings are too much hurt by it—I wore the same coat I Have on now when I went to the office—I was dressed very similar to what I am now—my whiskers were in just the same state—I never saw the prisoner after that day that I saw him at the office, except in custody.

Q. What have you been doing with yourself since the last trial? A. Employed at my business—I live now at No. 126, Cornwall-road, Lambeth—my business is carried on there—I work in the front room—it is a private house, with railings in front—I am a housekeeper there—I set up housekeeping the quarter before last—I had no communication with Mr. Hartley's solicitor, till after I heard the result of the investigation which took place after the last trial—I then read it in the newspaper—I have had a communication with Mr. Hartley's solicitor, since the last trial—I was desired to go to know if I should be wanted, and told them where to find me—(looking at No. 3)—I do not know in whose hand-writing this "W. Marsh, Esq." is—it is not mine—all my family have been liberated as well as myself—my object in giving my last statement was certainly to effect that purpose.

Q. Did you know Allen, a clerk at! Messrs. Hartley's? A. No, I never saw him to my knowledge—I never had any acquaintance with any body of that name—I have no recollection of any such person living in my neighbourhood—I will swear I have no acquaintance of that name—I do not know a person named Mitchell—I have heard the name—I never had any acquaintance of that name—the hay that was found in the boxes was taken away by Ellis Caspar in his pocket-handkerchief, and the wooden boxes were burnt—he did not appear to take great care of the hay.

Q. Why not suggest to him it would be better to burn it? A. The

blaze might have set the chimney on fire—I do not know that that reason was assigned, but it would have that effect—there was a good large pocket-handkerchief full—no means were attempted to burn it—it might have been burnt certainly.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have been asked whether you wrote the direction of No. 3, "William Marsh, Esq."—did you know there was such a person in existence? A. I never heard of such a name—I never heard of a person named Allen living near me—I had not the most distant idea that Mr. Hartley had a servant or clerk of that name—I did not know any of the clerks or servants except the prisoner—I read in the newspaper the decision of the judges on the last trial—I went to Mr. Hartley in consequence of his sending his porter—MR. Hartley told me to call on Mr. De Mole, to see if he wanted me—he sent me to Mr. Humphreys, who said he would send me a subpoena when I was wanted—I have always been willing since the last trial to state what I knew of the transaction—I do not know whether Ellis Caspar took away all the hay which was in the boxes, some might have been left—I was never charged with any offence in my life until this circumstance—I conducted Mr. Hyam's whole business for more than ten years, and am in his service now—Davis is one of the persons indicted as Isaac Isaacs—he has run away.

Q. You have made a statement respecting the ore at his house in Oxenden-street, was that part of the statement you were prepared to make before Davis ran away? A. Certainly not—I was to have screened him—it was at his dictation I made the statement, to screen him, and when he found I made the statement before the magistrate which I did, he ran away.

Q. What time on Sunday, the 24th of March, was it that the two Caspars came to your house? A. I have no doubt it was between one and two o'clock—that was the usual time I used to go home to dinner, and I met them in the street—none of my family were ever brought to trial—I remember Ellis Caspar being in difficulties—I proved under his bankruptcy as a creditor—I have the bill now in my pocket—I dare say I had a dozen meetings with the Caspars before the proposition to copy these forma was made to me—there were several meetings at different times—the original proposition was about another parcel called stones.

COURT. Q. You say you thought you were not doing wrong when you went to the office, when did you first have reason to know you were doing wrong? A. The same evening Ellis Caspar came to my house, and told me the nature of the business I had been engaged in—he then told me there was gold in it—I knew it was something intended to be kept secret, but I had no knowledge of it being a robbery—I knew false papers were made out, and that I obtained the articles' in a false name—it was given to me by the prisoner's direction—I knew I was lending myself to something not entirely correct, but supposing the prisoner to be a respectable young man, and knowing his father, I did not suppose a robbery was committed.

Q. When you were shifting cabs, and taking things in an omnibus, and by false letters getting goods by false names, did not you know you were lending yourself to a false transaction? A. I did not get the letters Milled up—I carried a letter which was originally written by myself, but I had not read it—it was folded, and I never opened it.

Q. He came to the cab with you, and compared the letters, said there

was something wrong, showed the paper to you, told you to assume a false name, and to go and get the goods? A. I was not aware of it being a theft, however strange the circumstance may appear—I mean to assert that—the prisoner told me I might depend on him, he would take all the blame if any body could blame him, as he was the principal in the concern, and I had nothing to fear—I thought it was samething of smuggling, I admit, but further than that I did not think—I knew it was gold the same night, Ellis Caspar told me so.

JURY. Q. You knew it was valuable property before? A. I never was given to understand so.

Q. Why put it in your bed-room? A. Because I had no mote convenient place—it was a very snail place I lived in, and the back parlour used by my wife was very small—I had no motive in carrying it up stairs but putting it out of the way—I have not said it was for security.

COURT. Q. When you burnt the lid what did you think? A. Then I knew all about it, I had been told—I have sot charged any person who had no share with me in the transaction—my false statement were only to screen the guilty—that was Mrs. Abrahams and Davis—I have not falsely charged any one with the crime—I never made any but the present statement on oath.





HENRY MITCHELL
. I am a messenger at Mr. Hartley's office is John-street. On the 25th of March I saw the witness John Vince with the city of Limerick's ship's box, containing the papers—I saw him lay it on the wash-band-stand—I saw the prisoner that morning about eight o'clock—he just walked through the warehouse into his own office as I supposed, and went out again, saying he would be in in a short time—I received the ship's box while he was out—he came back and opened the box as it stood there, and took papers out—he generally came to the office about nine o'clock, but this morning he came about eight—it might be a few minutes sooner or later—I went for the letters that morning to a receiving house in the Minorie s, and got the letters, which I brought to the office and delivered to the clerk, William Blundell, who took an account of them, about twenty minutes or a quarter to ten o'clock—he remained in the office, and took an account of the letters—the prisoner was standing at his desk at the same time, and took part of the letters out of Blundell's hands—I then went to breakfast—both the prisoner and Blundell stretched out their hands at the same time to receive the letters, but I gave then to Blundell, and he opened them—they were tied in a string—he was commencing to take the account, and while he was doing so, the prisoner took part of them—I went to breakfast, leaving Blundell taking the account—I returned at near ten o'clock, and met the prisoner coming down stairs—he sent me down to the wharf with a letter to give to Mr. Bristow, the wharfinger, and told me to tell Mr. Bristow, or any of the clerks there, not to let any of the specie off the wharf till he himself came down—I went to the wharf but did not see Mr. Bristow—I saw Feltham and the foreman of the wharf, and delivered the message—I then returned to the prisoner—I was sent down to the wharf again—I then saw Mr. Bristow at the wharf, and delivered the former message to him—I then returned to the prisoner, and found Moss—(looking at him)—with him in the prisoner's office, which was the back room—they did not remain many minutes after I came in—they both walked out of the back office through the warehouse, and went out—Moss got into a cab—the prisoner remained behind, shut the door, and went to his room.

Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a common thing to send you down to the

wharf with a message? A. Yes, every day—I am there for the purpose—I am not aware that he ever sent me with such a message before, not to let things go till he came—his orders were generally in writing, sometimes verbal—he has not sent me with such messages before to my knowledge—I will not swear he has not—he was there about eight o'clock that morning, a few minutes before or after—it was before I had any thing but the office open and the floor sprinkled to be swept—seven o'clock is the hour it opens—I will swear he was there before nine o'clock that morning—there is a time-piece in the office.

Q. What is the earliest hour you have known him at the office? A. I have seen him between seven and eight o'clock when a vessel has been sailing at six o'clock, but that was very seldom—I believe he has sometimes slept on board a vessel on such occasions, as I have taken notes to his mother's house on those occasions—I cannot say he slept on board—I have heard so—he had his breakfast at the office those mornings—he might have had his breakfast at the office on other mornings besides those on which vessels sailed; but put it altogether I do not suppose I have brought him half a dozen breakfasts since I have been there—I cannot say whether they were all shipping mornings—I have been nearly eight years in the employ—I should say the prisoner has been in the office between two and three years, but at the time he joined the concern I belonged to the west-end office—I should say we have both been in the same office about two years—I am not aware that—he has breakfasted there with Mr. Hartley—he might—MR. Hartley did sleep there sometimes—I have not teen the prisoner breakfast with him.

Q. Who else was at the office that morning at eight o'clock? A. The next clerk that came was Allen—he came about half-past eight, as near as I can say—and another came, I should say, at nine o'clock—I believe that was Mr. Blundell, but I had gone for the letters about a quarter before nine, as there was a clerk in the place—it was a grocer's shop where I went to for the letters—the people generally meet there to get their letters—Moss is the person who came to the office that morning—I persist in swearing that—I gave a description of the person on the last trial—I dare say I stated-then that the man had sandy whiskers—I did—I said large bushy whiskers.

Q. Do you call Moss a person with large bushy sandy whiskers? A. Undoubtedly not at present—his whiskers are not in the same state as they were when he came to the office—I believe I described his whiskers as meeting close to the chin—to the best of my opinion they were false—they were never the natural growth of his face—they were sandy at that time, to the best of my opinion—I am not aware that I gave that description to Roe and Lea—when brought to Lambeth-street I described them as I have now—I do not call them sandy now—I am not aware that I gave a description of the man to Roe and Lea—I will not swear that I did—I did not, to my knowledge, swear on the last trial that I had given a description to one of the officers—to the best of my opinion, I did not—I am not aware that I gave that description to one of the officers, but I will not swear to any thing I am not conscious of—I did not, to my knowledge, give any such description either to Roe or Lea—I cannot answer in any other way—I cannot say what age the man who came to the office appeared to be—he seemed to me to be a middle-aged man, a man that had a halt in his walk—as he walked out of the warehouse he

appeared lame—he walked in that way—I might have said, he appeared to be a man about sixty years of age—I do not think I said sixty on the last trial—it is so long ago I might be wrong if I swore I did not—to the best of my opinion, I did not—I never, to my knowledge, described the man as appearing about sixty years of age—I only swear to the best of my opinion.

Q. Did he appear about sixty? A. He walked with his bead down—it is hard to describe what age he might be—I took him to be in the middle age of life—I should say fifty was nearer the mark—when a man is sixty he is going down hill—I did not take notice whether Allen was in the office or not at the time the man came.

Q. How soon after the robbery did Allen leave Mr. Hartley's office? A. To the best of my opinion, he left on Whit-Monday, seven weeks after the robbery—I might have said on the last trial that he left a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery, but I have found out since if I did say so I have said wrong—I remember seeing Moss in custody at Lambeth-street—I do not know when Moss was first taken, but I know Allen was in Mr. Hartley's employ, and left about Whit-Monday—I should say Moss had been examined before that—Allen did live in Commercial-road, but I rather think, about the time of the robbery he lived in a street opposite the wharf, Burr-street or something—I cannot say when he moved there—I do not know what has become of him—I have not heard whether he is living or dead—I should say he left the office very suddenly—he was at business the Saturday before, and did not make his appearance on Monday—I have stated that he eloped—those were the words I made use of—I did not notice whether the man who came to the office had a velvet collar to his coat or not, at the time I saw Moss first he was leaning both his arms on the desk—I had only a side-glance at him—I have not described him as having a velvet collar, to my knowledge—the prisoner superintended the business when Mr. Hartley was out of town—as far as I have seen, he appeared very zealous and industrious—I described the man as between five feet eight and nine—I never described him as six feet high.

MR. DOANE. Q. On the mornings when the prisoner occasionally came before nine o'clock, it was when vessels were to sail early? A. Those mornings in particular—no vessel sailed early on the morning in question—there was no reason, that I know of, for his coming before nine o'clock.

Q. You are not sure whether Allen was in the office when Most came; can you say whether you are sure that Most was with Allen or with the prisoner? A. I swear the prisoner and Moss were both together, and Moss took the cab, and the prisoner waved, his hand to him—I am positive Moss is the man.





WILLIAM BLUNDELL
. On the 25th of March I was a clerk in Mr. Hartley's office—I was in the counting-house that morning, when the General Post letters were delivered—the prisoner was there—I received the letters a little before ten o'clock from Mitchell—I keep a book, in which I enter the account of postage—I have it with me now—I made an entry that morning in the book, and altered it after I made it—the first entry was one Falmouth, two Plymouth, and four Dublin letters, which, according to my reckoning, came to 7s. 10d.—the prisoner took part of the letters from me, opened them, and returned them to me, and when he returned them to me there were two Falmouth letters—the postage of a

letter from Falmouth, at that time, was 1s.—it was the custom of the postman to put the amount of the letters on the back of one of them, and he had done so that morning—there was 1s. difference between his amount and mine—that would be the difference of one Falmouth letter—I put down the amount of the letters in my book, after I received them from Lewin Caspar, and my account was 1s. more than the postman's—the postman's entry on the letters was 1s. 10d.—it if our custom to settle with the General postman once a week—when I paid him that week I paid him for one Falmouth letter—the letters were taken into the office that morning by Lewin Caspar—about eleven o'clock that morning I was called out to see somebody—I went out, and saw a cab and a man in it—(looking at the witness Moss)—that is the man—he asked for Mr. Hartley—I told him that Mr. Hartley was not in town, but that Mr. Caspar, his agent, would see him—I went in and called the prisoner—he went out to the cab, and they both came through the outer office, and went into the inner office—they remained there a few minutes—they both came out together, Caspar opening the door for Moss—but before they came out the prisoner came from the inner office to me, and asked me Whether there were two boxes of gold dust marked "B. C. 18 and 19," consigned to the Brazilian a Company—I told him there was—I looked into the book to examine before I told him—Moss went away in the cab—the prisoner went out of the office into the street with him—I saw the prisoner again at two o'clock that day, and he told me that a robbery had been committed—he said nothing else that I am aware of, nothing about the letters that I am aware of—I cannot say that the word "forgery" was mentioned.

Cross-examined. Q. it would be Caspar's duty to open all letters that came there in the absence of Mr. Hartley? A. Yes—I received the letters from Mitchell—I entered part of them in the book immediately—I bad entered part of them when Caspar took some of them up—I entered them all before he took them away into the back office—it was not after his return from the back office that I discovered there was an extra letter, it was while he was standing at the desk—I was entering them when he took them—I had entered one Falmouth letter before he took them from me—I suppose he saw me do it—he was standing at the desk at the time, close to me—he knew it was my custom to enter letters in the book as soon as they came.

Q. When you received the letters back from Caspar, and saw two Falmouth letters instead of one, did you mention it to him? A. I told him there was 1s. difference in the postage—I did not make any observation about the difference in the letters—I did not tell him there was one Falmouth letter more than I had given to him—I did not think it was requisite—I immediately made the alteration—he did not say any thing particular when I told him there was 1s. difference in the letters—he had nothing to do with the payment of the pottage, any more than to see that it was correct—I went to the office at nine o'clock that morning—several of the clerks were there when I got there—I believe Francis Allen was there—Mitchell had gone for the letters—I paid the postman, at the end of the week, 25s. 6d., and 1s. 10d. for that morning.

Q. Now you say Moss is the person who came there; did he present the same appearance then that he does now? A. No, he had large black whiskers, not unusually large—they were large whiskers—they were so large that they attracted my particular attention—very different

from what he appears now—I did not observe what age he appeared to be exactly—I am not aware that I have ever said he was a man of fifty or sixty years of age—I do not remember that I said on the last trial, he was a man between fifty and sixty years of age—I might have said so, but I cannot say, it is so long since—I think I heard Mitchell say he was about sixty—I cannot say whether I swore that at the last trial or not—I believe I did—the person stooped as he walked, I should say, from infirmity or age—I think I said, last time, that he was from five to six feet high, leaving plenty of room for guessing—I did not say he was about five feet seven inches—Caspar was not at the office when I got there at nine o'clock—it was after nine o'clock when I first saw him that morning—I cannot say whether it was as late as half-past—I should say it was between nine and half-past nine o'clock—nine o'clock was my usual time for going to the office—I believe Caspar very often went earlier than that—it was necessary for business—I have seen nothing of Moss since' the last trial, only about here the last day or two—not at the office, or anywhere else—I am not aware of any mistakes in letters from correspondents at Falmouth with regard to goods consigned—mistakes have happened—goods have been entered on the manifest, and have not arrived, and letters hare occasionally been written to correct the errors—I have known letters from Messrs. Carne correcting errors made in previous communications—that has sometimes happened—I do not know that it has not frequently happened—I have not been in the habit of reading the letters—I have heard of such things in the office—I think Allen was in the office when I got there that morning—I cannot say positively—he remained in the office six or seven weeks I think afterwards—I do not exactly remember the time Moss was taken into custody—I do not know that Allen went off very suddenly—I know it was talked of that be ran away, that be went away—I think Moss was taken about four or five weeks afterwards—I do not remember whether it was about the same time that Allen left—I believe it was—I do not know that Allen has run away to America—I do not know whether he it living or dead—I have not heard.

Q. Were the papers in the office open as much to Allen and the other clerks as they were to Caspar? A. No, not private letters—letters of any importance were not open to any one who liked to read them.

Q. But could not any other clerk in the office, if so disposed, read any of them? A. No, because they were always looked up, I believe—I dare say I could have read them if they were lying about—I cannot say where the keys were kept, unless Caspar kept them—I am not aware that they hung up in the office—I never knew of their being kept in the office—Allen was collecting clerk—he was occasionally in the habit of going on board steam-vessels, and to the wharf—there are two cupboards in the office, in which boxes of letters were kept—letters received in the morning from correspondents would be put in the cupboard—it was not locked'—I believe any clerk in the office could have gone and looked at them—I have no doubt of it.

Q. Was it not matter of public talk and notoriety that Allen had run away? A. Not that I am aware of—it was talked of in the office that he had gone away, and had not been seen since, but not that he had run away—I am not aware that any inquiries have been made about him—I have never seen him since.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Whose business was it to take care of letters and

superintend the business of the office in the absence of Mr. Hartley? A. Caspar's—it was his duty to take charge of letters, to read, and answer them—no other person in the office had any right to read private communications made to Mr. Hartley but the prisoner—I believe I was asked nearly all these questions about Allen on the former trial—there have been letters from Messrs. Came correcting communications of the delivery of goods—Caspar would know that, and would know how the absence of goods might be accounted for—I did not get to the office till nine o'clock—whether Caspar was there before that, or what he had been doing between eight and nine o'clock, I do not know—at the time I spoke to Caspar about the postage, I had no idea that one of those letters was a forgery, nor that the post-mark had been forged, or that any fraud had been committed or contemplated—I supposed it was a mistake of my own, and altered it—Allen went away about six or seven weeks after this transaction—I do not know when Moss was taken.

JURY. Q. On the 25th, when the letters arrived, was it possible that any one besides the prisoner could have seen them previous to the arrival of Moss? A. If they were laid on the desk, and no one was in the office, any one could walk in and see them—they did not lay there that I know of.

Q. From the time you received the letters from Mitchell till you saw Moss there, was it possible for any one but the prisoner to see those letters? A. No.

COURT. Q. What time did you see Moss come? A. Nearly eleven o'clock, and the post arrived about a quarter before ten—the prisoner was present when Mitchell delivered the letters to me—I delivered over to the prisoner all the letters I received—several other clerks were in the office when Mitchell delivered the letters to me, but nobody handled them but I and the prisoner—he had taken some letters from me before I made the entry complete in the book.





THOMAS KINGSTON
. I am foreman at Iron-gate-wharf. On the 25th of March, I remember a person coming there in a cab, about twelve o'clock—(looking at Moss)—that is the man—he asked me if the agent was in—I told him he was not in town, but the wharfinger was at home—he mentioned Mr. Bristow by name, and desired me to call him out—I called him out, and he came out to him, went to the cab, and they spoke together—Moss then came out of the cab into the counting-house with Mr. Bristow—he was there about two minutes, and came out—I brought out one box and another man another, by Mr. Bristow's desire—MR. Bristow told me to put those boxes into the cab, which I did—they were marked "B. C. 18 and 19"—Moss gave me a shilling and drove away in the cab with the two boxes—I had seen the prisoner in the counting-house that morning, about an hour before Moss came.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure Moss is the man? A. I am I have no doubt of it whatever—I never said I had a doubt—he had larger whiskers then, and he looks fatter now than he did then, in my opinion—his whiskers were a size larger than now, as large as mine—I call mine larger than his, middling sized—they were black, I am certain, quite black—I saw him next at Lambeth-street, about three weeks or a month afterwards, and I knew him at once—I knew Allen very well—I did not see him in the course of that day, to my recollection—he ran away from Mr. Hartley's—every body knew that—he ran away,

I believe, about the beginning of May—the' first time I saw Moss at Lambeth-street was about April, I think—I cannot say whether it was about the same time as Allen ran away—it was not a great while.





EDWARD BRISTOW
. I am chief clerk at Iron-gate-wharf. On the 25th of March last I remember seeing the prisoner at the wharf, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—I was in the counting-house—he brought a letter with him—(looking at No. 3)—this is it—he threw it on the desk, and said he had received it that morning from Messrs. Carne, to deliver two boxes, marked "B C 18 & 19," to a gentleman who would produce a letter from them—he said he had given an order at the foot of the letter for me to give them to him.
(No. 3, read, addressed,) "Messrs. James Hartley, and Co., 16, Crutched Friars, London." Falmouth post-mark, 23rd of March. London post-mark, 25th of March. "Falmouth, 23rd of March, 1839. 'Gents. We write to beg you will correct our error in this day's list, by delivering under-mentioned to the firm at foot instead of Bank. We will write to Mr. Haggard on the subject, and trusting to your attention, We are, gentlemen, your obedient servants, W. and E.C. CARNE. Wm. Marsh, Esq., Agent to the Brazilian Mining Company, or order, freight, and charges paid, 2 boxes, marked 'B C No. 18 & 19." "To Messrs, James Hartley, and Co., 16, John-street, Crutched Friars, London."





EDWARD BRISTON
—(continued)—I was at that time copying the manifest of the City of Limerick—after he had shown me the letter, he told me to deliver them to the gentleman on the production of the order—I asked him bow long he thought the gentleman would be before he came—he said he expected he would have been there before him—I wished him to stay and see them delivered—I was aware they contained large property, by the statement on the manifest, which made me wish him to stop—he said he would stay—he remained about half an hour—he then went away with other packages, which he had, to the Bank of England—the expected gentleman came, I should think, rather more than half-an-hour after the prisoner left—Kingston, the foreman, informed me of his arrival—I went out, found a cab there, and a person in it—it was Moss—I saw the letter in his hand, with the order of the prisoner at the foot—he showed it to me—this is it—(looking at No. 4)—I believe the order at the bottom to be in the hand-writing of the prisoner, and also this memorandum endorsed upon it—I have often seen him write.

No. 4, read, (the back of which was torn off)—Falmouth post-mark, "23rd March"—London post-mark, "25th March." "Falmouth, 23rd March, 1839. Messrs. Wm. Marsh, Esq., or order, Secy. to Brazn. Mining Co. Gentlemen, Confirming your favour of the 16th inst., we have this day shipped on board City of Limerick to your address as under, which will be delivered to you on steamer's arrival, per Messrs. Hartley's, the agents, 16, John-street, Crutched-friars. Assuring ourselves of your future commands, we are, Gents., your obt. servants, W. & E.C. CARNE. Two boxes shipped by us, marked 'B. C. 18 and 19.'
"Mr. Bristow, please to deliver above,—Messrs. Carne have advised me about them, L. CASPAR."
Endorsement on back, "Enquire for Mr. Bristwo, Dublin steam-wharf, Irongate."

Q. Upon this being shown to you by Moss, did you do what the prisoner told you, deliver the boxes? A. Yes—I got a receipt for them

which Moss wrote across the letter—this is it, "Recd. the above, J, H. Dean, per Marsh, Esq."—he drove away with the boxes.

Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner, in the absence of Mr. Hartley, generally very much engaged in business? A. Yes—I do not consider that he had any time to throw away—I did not consider it extraordinary that he should go away after waiting half-an-hour—he had the whole business to attend to in Mr. Hartley's absence—I first heard there had been a robbery about two o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was not the first person to tell me—Kingston did—I saw the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon, he then told me of it—I was examined at Lambeth-street.

Q. From first to last did not the prisoner evince every anxiety to exert himself to the utmost to discover the perpetrators of the robbery? A. He certainly appeared very much excited about it—he expressed himself anxious that the perpetrators should be brought to justice—he never absented himself from the office to my knowledge—I have known him about four years—I never heard any thing but the highest character of him—he was always considered clever in business—I do not know that mistakes were occasionally made at the office—my duty is at the wharf—I have known some packages over, which were not in the manifest, and some packages in the manifest, not in the vessel.

Q. In different matters were there not mistakes occurring almost every day of some sort or other? A. There might be slight errors—I never heard of any serious ones—I was shown this letter (No. 4) by the prisoner, in Lea's presence, on the afternoon the robbery was committed—I believed the signature of Messrs. Came to it, to be genuine—I have seen Messrs. Carne's signature occasionally, and believed it to be genuine.

Q. Have you known the prisoner very often at the wharf early of a morning? A. No, not very early—I have seen him there at eight o'clock when he had occasion to go on board a vessel that was going to sail, but not on other occasions—I never recollect it—I will undertake to say I never did see him unless a vessel was sailing—I have seen him at the office as early as eight o'clock.

Q. Is that the sort of direction the prisoner would write as an order to deliver goods? A. Yes, when he had occasion to do so—I should have delivered a package without the order under it, but not such valuable property—if I saw the letter, believing it to be' signed by Messrs. Carne, I should have delivered it—believing it to be genuine, I should have delivered the goods—I knew Allen—I did not see him at the wharf that day, I am certain—he might be at the wharf once or twice a week—I remember his leaving suddenly—I do not know why he left, nor whether he is living or dead—I have never seen him since—I have never had any doubt about Moss being the person who came to the wharf—I did not hear Mitchell describe him—I remember bills being put up advertising the robbery—communications from Falmouth of consignments would be by post advising of them.

Q. Did such advice generally arrive the day before the goods? A. It depended on the passage the vessel had—this vessel left, I think, in time to be up on Sunday, but the letters could not be delivered until Monday—nobody in Mr. Hartley's establishment could know that the gold was coming—the writing of this letter, (No. 4,) is different to any writing I ever saw from Messrs. Carne's office, except the signature—it is very different to the prisoner's hand-writing—I should not consider any part of it like his, except the order and endorsement.


MR. BODKIN. Q. You remember the prisoner at the wharf at eight o'clock, when vessels have been starting—were any starting this morning? A. No—these boxes corresponded in every respect with the manifest.





WILLIAM DEBONNAIRE HAGGARD
. I am chief clerk in the Bullion-office at the Bank of England. On the 25th of March I did not receive two boxes of gold dust—I expected two, from a letter I received from Falmouth for the Brazilian Company.





JAMES PEAT
. I am accountant to the Brazilian Company. I went to the office of the Company on the 25th of March, about ten o'clock—no boxes of gold dust marked B C 18 and 19 arrived at the office—we expected such boxes—William March is our secretary—he came to the office about eleven o'clock—in consequence of a communication from him, I sent Carthew to the Dublin Steam-packet wharf—I was at the Bullion-office in the Bank about one o'clock, when the prisoner came there—I went to inquire if the boxes had arrived, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him what had become of oar two boxes of gold dust, marked B C 18 and 19—he said, "They have been delivered at your house"—I said, "How is that, when they are consigned by the bill of lading to the Bank of England?"—he said, "We have this morning received a letter from Messrs. Carne, stating, that in consequence of an error in the manifest, they were not to be delivered at the Bank of England, but to the agent of the Brazilian Company"—I asked him the name of the agent—he said he could not recollect, but if I would go with him to the office, in Crutched-friars, he would tell me the name—I asked him if the name was March—he said, "That, I think, is the name"—I then left the Bank, and left him—I went to our office, and ascertained that the boxes were not delivered there—I then went to the office in Crutched-friars, and saw the prisoner in the outer office—I said, "These boxes have not been delivered at our office, where are they?"—he said, "If you will walk into the inner office, I will tell you what has become of them"—he produced two letters to me—(looking at Nos. 3 and 4)—these are then—No. 4 was exactly in the same state then as it is now, with the address torn off—I asked him, "What has become of the outside of this letter, the address?"—he said, "I don't know whether it was torn off when it was first delivered into my hands, or whether it was torn off since"—he did not tell me whether he knew who it had been addressed to—he asked me if I thought the signatures of Messrs. Carne were genuine—I told him I thought not—he said, "Are they not like Messrs. Carnes' writing?"—I said, "Certainly, I think they are like it, but I think they are not genuine; I think they are forged"—I asked him if the body of the letter was written in a similar hand to any body in Messrs. Carnes' house that he was in the habit of seeing—if it was similar to any writing he had seen coming from Messrs. Carnes' house—he said, certainly it was, he had seen such writing often—he did not tell me whose writing it was.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him if the boxes had been delivered? A. He told roe they had been delivered that morning to a gentlemanly looking man, either representing himself as coming from William March, or William March himself, he could not tell which—he said he thought the letters genuine, and he had seen similar writing from Carnes' house—I am acquainted with Messrs. Carnes' writing—it is in some degree similar—I mean the signature, but, in my opinion, easily detected to be a forgery.

Q. Suppose a person received it in the hurry of business, do not you think he might be deceived by it? A. It is possible—(looking at No. 3)—

there is nothing particularly extraordinary in this letter—I should say, on looking at it, it is not what I consider exactly a mercantile letter—in the first place, it is addressed at foot "W. Marsh, Esq., agent to the Brazilian Mining Company, or order;" now Mr. March's name is spelt wrong, and he is not agent, but secretary to the company—(looking at No. 4)—this is decidedly much more unmercantile than the other, because it is addressed "Messrs. W. Marsh, Esqr."—the signature is somewhat similar to Messrs. Carnes'—it is a signature I would not act on.

Q. But a person reading it over once may very likely not be able to distinguish it from a genuine signature? A. It is possible, I cannot say it is probable I confess—I am not at all acquainted with the hand-writing of the prisoner—I should say the note at the bottom of No. 8, is a different hand-writing from the body, and the date also, "23rd of March, 1839" I should say was different—all the rest appears to be one hand-writing, except the note at the bottom, and the signature—I do not think the date is a similar hand-writing to the body, generally—I think it is a different hand-writing—I think the date of No. 4, and "Messrs. W. Marsh, Esq., Secretary to the Brazilian Mining Company, or order," is different to the body.

Q. In your judgment, could such an error as that be made by a person competent to conduct Mr. Hartley's business? A. Certainly not—nor any person in the habit of corresponding—"Messrs." is in the same line with the name, and appears in the same hand-writing as the rest of the address, and it appears to be squeezed into a place not large enough.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at the words, "City of Limerick" tell me whether that is the same hand-writing as the body? A. I think not—I think the "18 and 19" appear the same kind of figures as the date "1839."

Q. Can you perceive any difference in the writing and ink of the word "Messrs.," in the corner, and the name which follows? A. It appears to me it is all written with the same ink—the word "Messrs." is written rather larger than the rest of the name—it is the same as "W. Marsh, &c." in my opinion.





WILLIAM MARCH
. I am secretary to the Brazilian Company. Mr. George Haythorn is one of the proprietors of that company—there are other proprietors besides him—on the 20th of March we had advice of the arrival of some gold dust from the Brazils, by a letter from Messrs. Carne, of Falmouth—it was advice of two boxes of gold dust, "18 and 19," weighing 102 lbs. 10oz. 11 dwts., by the Sea Gull, they were forwarded by the City of Limerick steam-packet.

Q. When would it be known in London among persons conversant with shipping, that the Sea Gull had arrived? A. On the 20th, the day we received the advice—on the 25th of March I received further advice of their being shipped, by the City of Limerick steamer—a bill of lading was enclosed with the advice, which I thought I had here, but I find I have made a mistake, and brought the wrong one—I never authorised Moss, or any other person to go to Iron-gate-wharf, to receive those boxes—I had no idea of such a proceeding being taken.
"No. 1," being read, was the bill of lading of the City of Limerick, in which was "Two boxes of gold dust, marked B. C. 18 and 19," containing together 1021bs. 10oz. 11 dwts. troy, consigned to the Brazilian Company at the Bank of England.
No. 2. was the extract from the manifest of the City of Limerick, (as in page 686.)

No. 6, (read)—"Messrs. Jas. Hartley and Co., 16 John-street, Crutched-friars. Falmouth, Oct. 8, 1838, Gentlemen,—We are in receipt of your note of the 6th instant, and in reply, we beg to say the turtle it for Mr. Haggard, at the Bullion-office, Bank of England—The Duke of Cambridge arrived at noon—all well. We are, gentlemen, your obedient servants, W. and E.C. CARNE. Per Geo. Hugoe. P.S. We wrote you last night, per box, informing you we received the chest of tea, which shall be returned.
"Mr. Bristow, please attend to this.—L. CASPAR."






WILLIAM MARCH

continued. I never saw this letter (No. 4,) till after the robbery was effected—that is not written at all in a mercantile style, quite unbusiness-like.

Q. Would you, as a man of business, act on the receipt of that letter? A. Certainly not, not purporting to come from a respectable house like Carnes'—this letter (No. 3,) is not, in my judgment, a mercantile business-like letter—a person conversant with mercantile affairs would not act on such a letter, I should say—it is not quite so informal as the other, but my name is improperly spelt, and the firm it mentioned in the body of the letter, and at the bottom it says, "W. Marsh, Esq., agent"—Messrs. Carne are aware of the way to spell my name, and are constantly in the habit of writing to me, and they know I am not agent to the Company, but secretary.

Cross-examined. Q. You received the first intimation of the consignment of gold dust on the 20th of March? A. Yes—I did not make that communication public—it does not go beyond the directors of our own Company, and persons connected with the Company—I might mention It to them—I had no communication with the prisoner on the subject, nor with any body in Mr. Hartley's office.

Q. Although it would be known to shipping-people on the 20th, that the Sea Gull had arrived, would it be known to them what the cargo consisted of? A. It is very likely—it is often mentioned in the newspaper if there is specie on board.

Q. In your judgment, would any one conversant with mercantile matters, intending to commit a fraud, write such letters as these? A. It is difficult to say; a person well acquainted with business, I should say, hardly would—I did not know the prisoner before this.
(The record of the conviction of Moss was here produced and read.)
(Adjourned.)

Saturday, March 7th, 1840.





JAMES HARTLEY
. I carry on the business of a wharfinger and proprietor of steam vessels, with others, under the firm of James Hartley and Co.; I am the prosecutor of this indictment. On the 25th of March I was in Dublin—I came to London on the night of the 28th—the prisoner was in my service, and had at the rate of 150l. a-year—in February, last year, he applied to me for an increase of salary, which I declined—on the 21st of March, last year, I had occasion to write to the prisoner—this is the letter I wrote to him (No. 7)—this letter of the 26th of March (No. 5) is in the prisoner's hand-writing—that letter was never sent—Allen was in my employ—he quitted my employ on the 13th of May last—Moss was taken into custody about the middle of April—I have not the most remote reason to believe that Allen was concerned in this transaction.


Cross-examined. Q. He was a clerk in your employ, the same as the prisoner, but in a subordinate situation? A. Yes—he had a salary as the rest—I had no notice whatever of his going away—the last I saw of him was on Saturday evening, when I sent him to the Bank with lodgments—I have not seen him since—I have heard from his brother that he went to Montreal, and is dead—I did not learn when he went—I could have his brother here in a few minutes—I had the highest opinion of the prisoner's integrity, or I would not have left my business in his hands—a good deal of specie came to the Bank, which he had to superintend the delivery of.

Q. There was at one time 90,000, at another 10,000 guineas in one parcel? A. I do not recollect that, but very large sums passed through his hands—Moss surrendered himself in April—Allen lodged in Burr-street, Lower East Smithfield, the latter part of the time he was with me—I do not know whether he lived in Commercial-road before that—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the habit of sleeping on board vessels at times—I have seen him at my office early on shipping mornings, between seven and eight o'clock—I think he might be there on other mornings sometimes as early as eight o'clock.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Allen filled quite a subordinate situation to the prisoner? A. Yes—he had nothing to do with the letters or giving orders about bills of lading, or any thing, till they had gone through the prisoner's hands.





GEORGE CARTHEW
. I am in the service of the Brazilian Company. On the 25th of March, last year, I was sent to Mr. Hartley's office, in John-street, and saw a clerk there—I believe the prisoner to be the person, but I cannot swear to him—I inquired if two boxes of gold dust had arrived by their vessel, from Falmouth, on the Brazilian Company's account—he answered, "Yes"—this was about eleven o'clock in the morning—MR. Peat had sent me—I should think it was rather after eleven o'clock than before—I think I might be certain it was before twelve o'clock—I asked if two boxes bad arrived marked "B. C," and I think the numbers were "18 and 19"—I mentioned that to him—he said they had arrived—I then asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive as the Bank of England—he said, "They are about arriving there at this time"—I believe there was a second person there—the porter, who waited in the office when the clerks were not there—it was not Kingston—I have seen him here to-day—I think it was Mitchell.

Cross-examined. Q. You were examined on the last trial? A. Yes—to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner is the person I saw—I do not swear he is the person.

Q. Will you swear that you believe he is the man? A. No.

COURT. Q. Do you understand the question you have said you believed you saw the prisoner; do you mean you do not mean to represent your belief that he is the man? A. I believe he is the man, but I cannot swear it.

MR. JONES. Q. Do you mean to swear you believe he is the man? A. Yes. that is my belief—I cannot swear positively—I swear I believe he is the man—I remember being examined on the last trial upon this point.

Q. Did you not swear on that occasion that you did not see any one in Court that you saw on that occasion, looking at the prisoner? A. I had

not caught sight of him then—I did swear that, but it was before I had seen the prisoner—never having been in a Court before, I looked all round and did not see the prisoner—I said on the last trial that I would not undertake to swear to him by any means.

Q. Did you say a word on the last trial about asking the person you saw there when the boxes would be taken to the Bank of England? A. Yes, that I did—I swear that.

COURT. Q. You are not asked whether the fact passed, but whether you stated on the former trial that you put the question to the prisoner what time they would arrive at the Bank of England? A. I certainly gave that statement here, I am confident.

Cross-examined by
MR. JONES. Q. Do you mean to swear you said so on the last trial? A. I believe I repeated it as near as possible in the same words I have now—I certainly answered the question, and in the same words I think as I have stated now—I asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive at the Bank, and he said, "They are arriving about this time"—I stated that at the last trial—I will swear that—I believe I gave that in a confused way, and I was stopped—I was giving the two sentences together and I was stopped, and whether I gave it a second time or not I cannot swear—I should think it was as early at one o'clock in the afternoon that I went there—I will not be positive whether it was or not—I know it was about the middle of the day.

JURY. Q. Had you ever been to Mr. Hartley's office before the 25th of March? A. Many times—I do not recollect ever seeing the prisoner there on the different occasions.





HENRY MOSS

re-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. I forgot to ask you yesterday whether in the course of your conversations with the prisoner any thing passed on the subject of a letter received from Mr. Hartley? A. On Sunday, the 24th of March, the prisoner was at my house with his father, and the prisoner showed me a letter he had received from Dublin—I mentioned that at the police-office before the letter was shown to me—the subject of that letter was a complaint of his not having acknowledged the receipt of 300l.—I have no doubt this is the letter (No. 7.)
(This letter being read in part, was dated Dublin, 21st March, and was as follows:)—"Dear Sir, This day week I sent you an order for 300l., to be lodged on my credit at Williams and Co.'s, and you have not to this day acknowledged the receipt," &c.

JURY. Q. In the different statements you have made concerning this transaction, did you always make the same statement with respect to the share, the prisoner had in the transaction? A. Precisely to—I have always attributed to him the same share in the transaction.

Cross-examined. Q. I think you say you made three different statements? A. I think 1 did—I am confident I mentioned the prisoner's name in the first statement—I gave that statement to Davis, who took it from me and took it somewhere—I am quite confident I have always mentioned the prisoner to be in the situation I have placed him at the present time—I swear his name was mentioned in the statement Davis took away—it must have been after nine o'clock, or about nine o'clock, that I saw Ellis Caspar in my parlour on Monday night, the 25th of March—rather after than before—I was fetched from the public-house to him by my servant—I could not have sworn on the last trial that it was eight o'clock.


Q. Perhaps you have found out since that Lea swore he did not leave Ellis Caspar till nine o'clock? A. No.





JOHN ROE
. I am an officer of the City. My assistance was called in on the 26th of March last respecting this—after being at the office of Mr. Hartley, I went to St. Paul's coffee-house, and saw the prisoner there—he came while I was there—I asked him if he had the two letters with him, the one purporting to come from Falmouth, and the other from Marsh and Co. of Broad-street—his answer was, yes, he had, and be then produced them to me—these are them (Nos. 3 and 4)—No. 4 was just in the same state as it is now, with the back torn off, but the letters "er" left—I said "I suppose you know to whom this was addressed?"—he said "No, I do not"—I said, "Was it in that state when it was delivered to you by the gentleman?"—he said he could not say whether it was torn off before or since, all he had to look at was to see whether the signature was a genuine one, and which he believed it was—on the 1st of April following, in consequence of information I received, I went to New-street, Whitechapel-road—I found a house there without any body in it—I went from there to Mansel-street to the witness Moss—I had not communicated to either of the Caspars that I was going to Mansel-street—as far as I know they had no means of knowing what I was about—while I was in Mansel-street I saw the prisoner and his father both within thirty or forty yards of the house—they were merely coming down the street when I first saw them, and they immediately turned round again and went away—Mr. Hartley was with me—we overtook them, and Mr. Hartley asked the prisoner what he did there—(at that time we knew nothing against old Caspar)—his answer was he understood we had searched a house and found the gold, and he had come there to satisfy himself—he did not say who told him so, nor point out the house—he said he understood we had searched.

COURT. Q. He did not describe what street, or what place? A. No, but gave that as his reason for being in that street.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner and having conversation with him about his knowledge of Moss? A. Yes, that was the next day—I had not found any thing at that time—I had searched Moss's lodging on the morning I saw him in Mansel-street, but found nothing—on the following afternoon, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner in John-street, and asked him if he knew a person of the name of Moss—he said, "Yes, I do, two or three; one was my father's foreman once"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "When did you see him last?"—he said, "About seven months ago"—I said, "What was your business with him then?"—he said, "I merely met him by accident, and asked him how he did"—upon his giving that account, Mr. Hartley gave him into my custody—that was on the 2nd of April—Moss surrendered himself to me about the middle of April—I have possession of a handkerchief, which I produced yesterday—I got it from a man named Fiestell.





JONAS COUTER
. I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-office—Mr. Hartley's office, in John-street, is in my delivery, and was so in March last year—I have an account of letters delivered for Mr. Hartley on the 25th of March—the amount of the letters delivered that day was 7s. 10d.—I only keep an account of the unpaid letters.

Cross-examined. Q. Were there any paid letters, do you know? A. I cannot recollect, there might have been—I have been in the habit of delivering letters at Mr. Hartley's office nearly five years—there have some-times

been disputes and mistakes, but I always stuck to my book—I was right and they wrong.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever had complaints that you made a mistake against yourself, in not having charged enough? A. No, I think not—this would be against myself.





WILLIAM DAVIS
. I am an inland messenger of the General Post-office. There is a circular stamp kept at the General Post-office, with which all unpaid letters are stamped—the bags, on the 25th of March, were divided into eight divisions—each division was stamped with a particular letter—there were four stamps for each of the seven divisions, and one for the eighth, which is an auxiliary division—(looking at the post-mark on letter No. 3)—this stamp I do not consider the office-stamp—it is not the genuine stamp of the office—it is the London mark "E. M. R. 25,—39")—from the appearance of that stamp, that letter could not have come through the General Post-office—(looking at No. 4)—this is not the genuine London stamp—that could not have come through the General Post-office—it would not get such a stamp by coming through the post—(looking at No. 2)—this is the genuine London post-stamp—the form of the letters and the figures on the stamps on Nos. 3 and 4 have been imitated—I have the genuine stamp with me, but there has been an alteration as regards the date, from "39" to "40"—we change them yearly—the circle of the letter "E" is the same—the genuine stamp of the day and year was produced on the last trial, but since that the "39" has been altered to "40"—the letter "E" is a fixture, and the figures "18" in the circle—the same type is used for M. R. this year as in 39—here is an impression, taken in a book on that day before the duty commences—(producing it)—all, the genuine impressions would exactly correspond with this.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you stamp letters on the 25th of March? A. I did not—the book is signed by Atkinson—I should think these stamps would be calculated to deceive an ordinary eye, but would be detected by the experienced eye of a Post-office clerk.





JANE BRADLEY
. On the 25th of March, last year, I lived with the witness Moss as his servant, and had done to about two years—he lived in New-street, just by the London Hospital, all the time I was with him—he went out in a working-dress when he went to work in a morning—that was generally the case, except on Sundays—on Monday, the 25th of March, he went out about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, as near as I can recollect—he was dressed in his best clothes—he returned between one and two o'clock, as dear as I can recollect—I heard a knock at the door—it was one knock—he usually gave a double knock—mistress opened the door to him—I heard him say when he was let in, "Where is the girl?"—he usually dined between one and two o'clock—he did not stop to dinner that day—he did not remain long before he went out again, I think, about half-an-hour, as near as I can recollect, but I cannot recollect—he came back again directly, and asked for his handkerchief—mistress brought him down two handkerchiefs, and I gave them to him—one was a kind of red one, I forget the colour of the other—he came back in the evening, I think, about eight o'clock, as near as I can guess, and had his tea—he then washed himself, put on his common coat, the coat he went to work in, and went out—I cannot say at what time he went out—while he was out, Ellis Caspar called at my master's house, and I went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house to fetch my master—I knew I should find

him there—he came back with me—Ellis Caspar was still there—I did not sleep in the house—I think I left about eleven o'clock that night—Ellis Caspar was there still in the house with master—I returned next morning, I think, about half-past six o'clock—it was my duty to light the fire—the fire-place looked very dirty, and was all over white ashes—it seemed to be the ashes of wood—there were some nails mixed with them, and the hob had red sealing-wax on it—my master was in bed when I got there—my mistress went out directly after I got there—my master came down soon after, about half-an-hour after mistress went out, between seven and eight o'clock, I believe—he went out after dinner—he dined about one o'clock—I do not recollect that he went out from seven o'clock in the morning till one o'clock—he went out about half-an-hour or an hour after dinner—I found lodgings were taken in Mansel-street, which is about a mile from New-street—I packed up, to take the things away—there was a box, secured with a rope—it was Mr. Moss's daughter's box—it appeared very heavy—I saw it taken away in a truck—we went to the new lodging in Mansel-street on the Tuesday night.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you taken up on this matter? A. Yes—I was kept under Lea's care, at the Flying Horse public-house—I do not live with Moss now—I have learnt a business—I was at home on Sunday, the 24th of March, at Moss's house, all day—I had my meals there—they dined about one o'clock on Sundays—that was the usual hour, sometimes later—it might be a little after one o'clock, because he came home from work—he used to work on Sunday—he went out to work that Sunday, about nine o'clock, and came home about one o'clock, or a little after—he came home by himself—I did not see any body with him—nobody came to dinner that day—Ellis Caspar came while they were having dinner—he was in the front parlour—I did not see any more persons come that day—I did not see him come with my master—I think he came while he was at dinner, and went into the parlour—then Moss went and spoke to him, and then he went home, and Moss went to his work—I do not recollect whether I opened the door to him—I saw him there—I think he remained about half-an-hour—I was in the back parlour.

Q. And he in the front parlour, with your master and mistress? A. Mistress was not there—I opened the room door, I think, and let him in—I told master Mr. Caspar wanted him, and Ellis Caspar went into the front parlour—I do not recollect going into that parlour while he remained there.

Q. Can you tell whether any body except your master and Ellis Caspar was in the parlour? A. No, I cannot, but there was somebody else there at night—I do not recollect any body else being there between one and two o'clock—I did not see them, but I was about my work—I did not let any body else in—I did not see Ellis Caspar go away, but I heard the door shut—somebody was there on Sunday night, but I did not see them—I left the house that night, I dare say, between nine and ten o'clock—my master came home about eight o'clock on the Monday evening, washed, and went out—he had gone, it might be about half-an-hour, when Ellis Caspar came—the Earl St. Vincent public-house is not a great way from the house—it would take me five or ten minutes to walk there—my master came with me, and found Ellis Caspar at his house when we got there.

Q. Did you notice what time Ellis Caspar came to your master's house that night? A. I think it was about nine o'clock, or a little after—I think

it was as much as that, but I cannot exactly say—I think it was about nine o'clock—the Earl St. Vincent public-house is not within three or four doors of the house—it is not in the same street; you turn down a street, and then down another street—it is at the back of the hospital.

Q. Do you remember at any time, after this business, being in a hackney-coach? A. Yes, I got into it, I think, in Whitecbapel—Roe and Lea were with me—nobody else came into the coach while I was in it, that I know of—there was no person there who I did not know—I do not know where I went in the coach—I got out at a place I think was an office—it was not Lambeth-street—I do not know where it was—I was not in a hackney-coach with them at any other time.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. You do not recollect, positively, whether you opened the door or not yourself on Sunday? A. No, I remember seeing Ellis Caspar—whether there was any body else, I do not know.

COURT. Q. Where was Mrs. Moss at dinner on Sunday? A. She was there—we dined in the back parlour, but they were in the front parlour.





THOMAS HARLAND
. On the 25th of March last, I was the driver of a cab—I was on the stand at Cornhill—about twelve o'clock that day, Moss got into my cab, and desired me to drive him to Iron-gate-wharf, which I did—one of the porters came out—(looking at Kingston)—that is the man—he came to the cab door—Moss remained in the cab some time—the porter fetched a gentleman—(looking at Mr. Bristow)—that is the gentle-man—Moss showed him a bill or letter—he then went out of the cab into the wharf—he was followed out of the wharf by a man who put two boxes into the cab—there was some red wax on then—Moss had a blue bag—I gave one of the porters a four-penny piece, by his direction—I do not recollect whether he gave the porter any thing—I think he gave Kingston a shilling—I drove him to the Cross Keys public-house, Wood-street—he told me to drive fast—the boxes were taken out there, and put into the office, and I was dismissed.





JOHN MACBETH
. I am a cab-driver. On the 25th of March last, I was in Cheapside—Moss hired me, and told me to drive to the Cross Keys, Wood-street—one box, in a blue bag, and another not in a bag, were put into the cab—he told me to drive him to the London Hospital—I was going to drive into the Hospital, but he called out, and got out at the corner of the hospital, that is no great distance from New-street—he took one box out with him, which was in the bag, and told me to take care of the other—he came back, with a blue bag empty in about three-quarters of an hour, and told me to drive him to the Iron-bridge—the remaining box was still in the cab—I went down Commercial-road, but he pulled me up just beyond Limehouse church, on the left hand—he got out, put the box on the pavement, and put it into the bag—I assisted him, as the box was heavy—there were seals and pink tape round it—this was about one o'clock.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see-any one else with him at the London Hospital? A. No one at all—Moss had rather mare whiskers then than he has to-day—they were black whiskers—and he had a blue rough frock-coat, not the sort of coat he has on now—to the best of my knowledge, it was a blueish coat, and a frock-coat—I believe, I am positive of its being a frock-coat, and a blue one.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any recollection of his dress at all—can you undertake to swear what his dress, was? A. No.






GEORGE CARTHEW

re-examined. Q. Is Mitchell the man you saw? A. He is not—it was a much taller man, and older—I do not think he is the man.

MR. JONES. Q. Look at that young gentleman (Blundell) will you undertake to say he is not the person you saw at the office when you asked about the boxes of gold? A. I have no recollection of ever seeing Mr. Blundell at that office—I do not know that I could swear, he might not be the man, but my recollection carries me that the prisoner is the person I speak of.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have no recollection of ever having seen Blundell at the office at all? A. Not up to that time—I have since.





WILLIAM BLUNDELL

re-examined by
MR. JONES. Q. Do you know Carthew? A. No, I never saw him before, that I am aware of—I might have seen him standing about here—I do not remember having any conversation with him at the office about the specie.

COURT. Q. Did you ever tell any man, on the 25th of March, that the specie would be about that time at the Bank of England—did any body ask you if you could inform him what time they would arrive at the Bank of England? A. I believe there was a man called—I believe he asked me that question—I believe it was while the prisoner was absent—I cannot undertake to swear that person was not Carthew—I do not know who he was—I do not remember whether the man stated that he came from the Brazilian Company.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. You do not recollect seeing Carthew? A. No, I do not recollect the person of the man who called, or whether he was young or old.

COURT. Q. Was the question put to you at Mr. Hartley's office, whether two boxes of gold dust had arrived, marked "B. C. 18 and 19," by any vessel from Falmouth? A. I believe something to that effect—it was put to me—I believe I answered, "Yes"—the same person asked if I could inform him what time they would arrive at the Bank, and I think the answer I gave was, "They are there by this time."

Q. How did you know any thing about it? A. I knew they would be landed about ten o'clock, and by that time they would arrive at the Bank of England—I knew they were expected by the manifest-book—I had copied the manifest into the book.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there several inquiries made about the boxes? A. No, I believe not.





GEORGE SHEEN
. I helped to move Moss's goods from New-street to Mansel-street—a box was produced to me upon the last trial—that was very much like one of the boxes I moved upon that occasion—I know Mrs. Levy, Moss's sister—she was there assisting.





GEORGE READ
. I am a tailor, and live in Northumberland-place, Commercial-road. I had a house in New-street, No. 12. On the 26th March, Moss lived there—he went away on the 27th.





JOSEPH JEPSON
. I live in Mansel-street. In March last year Mrs. Moss engaged apartments at my house—the goods came in on the 26th and 27th.





EDWARD HENRY
. I live in Bread-street, Cheapside, and am a merchant. I knew Moss in the service of Mr. Hyams, who I had dealings

with. On the 25th of March, Moss came to my house—I gave him a cheque that morning before ten o'clock—I do not exactly recollect the hour—this is the cheque, (No. 9.)





LUCY MARSHALL
. I am a widow. I lived opposite Moss's house in New-street—I knew his person well. On Monday, the 25th of March last, I saw him go into his house, about three o'clock, or between three and four o'clock—I observed he had something very weighty with him—he used to have a plate with his name on the door, and next morning I observed that the plate was taken off—I saw the goods being moved away that day—a box; was shown to me at the last trial—I saw a box like that moved out.





ADOLPHUS FIELDSTELL
. In March last, and before that, I kept a coffee-shop in Great Tower-street. I have known the prisoner a long time—I was not acquainted with Moss at that time—I remember the prisoner coming to my coffee-shop—it must have been before March—I think in January, at the end of January—there was a gentleman with him, but I cannot recollect him—they had coffee there—after they were gone I found a pocket handkerchief—(looking at the one produced by Roe)—I believe this is the handkerchief—I had known the prisoner a very long time—he had never been to my coffee-shop before, to my knowledge—I am certain of his having been there on that occasion—I believe this to be the handkerchief, but I gave it directly to my wife, and did not examine it so accurately—I had it back from her afterwards, and delivered it up at the police-office, to Lea or Roe—(looking at Roe)—that is the gentleman—I gave him the same handkerchief as I picked up that day.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at your shop before? A. Not to my knowledge—I have known him from a child—I did not know Moss at all—I cannot swear to his person—he might have been at my coffee-shop—there may be a hundred people in my house at a time—I swear I do not recollect Moss—I have never seen him at my coffee-house since to my knowledge, and I do not swear it was him with the prisoner—I found the handkerchief, and gave it to my wile instantly—I do not believe any one was in the room when I found it, because it was about six o'clock, when they went away, and I went up stairs to see if any body had left any thing, and found the handkerchief—I took it down to my wife instantly—it was about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening when I found it, to the best of my recollection—I had a waiter at that time who was my wife's brother—I solemnly declare he was not present when I found it—I knew where the prisoner's father lived at that time—I found the handkerchief in the place where the prisoner and the other had sat.

Q. Did you take any pains to inform the prisoner you had found it? A. I did not see him afterwards, but I left it, saying, should Mr. Caspar call, for the handkerchief to be returned—I did not send to him, because I did not know who had lost it, the prisoner or his companion—I believed one of them had, but many other people came to the house.

Q. Why not send to the prisoner to say you had it? A. I did not know whether the prisoner would not come back to ask for it—I should not have kept it if it had not been inquired for—it is in possession of the officer—I kept it five, six, or seven weeks—I did not know where the prisoner lived, and if I had, I expected he might have called again, and that might have been another 1s. in my pocket—I have never had any communication with Moss since that time.


Q. Do you mean to swear you saw that handkerchief for the first time on the day the prisoner was at your shop? A. I can swear positively, I believe it is the handkerchief I found at the time the prisoner was at my house, but I will not positively swear it is the handkerchief until my wife identifies it.

COURT. Q. The question is, whether you found it on the day the prisoner was at your house? A. Yes, I did.

MR. JONES. Q. Do you know Davis? A. A little Jew has called at my house, I believe, once—I swear solemnly that I did not know he was Moss's stepfather—I heard afterwards that he was—I saw Davis—I do not know where he lived—he did not tell me—he came with another person—I have not received 15l. from Davis since this transaction—I received 2l. from him at the time he came to my house with a person named Mrs. Abrahams—I mean the Mrs. Abrahams who was tried—they came to my shop a few days after the prisoners were taken up—the handkerchief was produced to them—they did not ask for it—they came while I was out, and applied to my wife, and she showed it to them—I saw them when I came home.

Q. What did you receive the 2l. for? A. I did not know Davi's at all, but Mrs. Abrahams came to me, and said, "Do you know Caspar?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "How long is it since you have seen him?"—I said, "About two months ago."

Q. On what account did you receive the 2l.? A. I must tell you what for—he did not owe me any money—I did not know him—he gave me the money—he made me a present of it—I had seen Davis before, but not known him—I never had any previous transaction with him.

Q. Now, why did he give it you? A. Mrs. Abrahams called on me with him, and I knew Mrs. Abrahams very well—she said, "Mr. Fiestell, do you know the name of Caspar?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Do you know the gentleman who was with him? can you recollect him?"—I said, "No"—she said, "Don't you know Mr. Moss?"—I said I did not—she said, "Suppose I tell you how he looks, so and so"—I said, "Tell me what you like, I can't recollect him"—she said, "I shall describe him to you"—I said, "If I take descriptions of people who come to my house I must have a very good memory, but, perhaps, if you show him to me I may recollect him"—at that time there was 500l. reward against Moss, and it appeared to me they would not let me see him—David made me a present of 2l. to induce me to say I knew him, but I would not.

Q. But you took the 2l.? A. Certainly, why should not I? but when I came to the office he was pointed out to me, and I said, "No, I can't swear to him," and I would not swear to him.

Q. It was given to you to swear Moss had been at your coffee-house with Caspar? A. He made me a present of it—the handkerchief was shown by my wife, but not in my presence—I believe I did not see it—I might have seen it, or I might not—I believe I did not, because it was shown to them before—they had called twice.

Q. Was it not mentioned in that conversation that you should swear that handkerchief was left when the prisoner was at your house? A. I cannot recollect it.

Q. Do you mean to swear you cannot recollect? A. I cannot recollect that the handkerchief was shown.

Q. That is not the question—Will you swear you cannot recollect whether

the 2l. was given to you to swear you found it there on a day when the prisoner bad been at your shop? A. I do not recollect—I do not know what they gave me the 2l. for.

COURT. Q. Did they suggest to you that you should prove the handkerchief was left when the prisoner was there, at the time you had the 2l.? A. The 2l. was given to me to swear I knew Moss, to identify him—there was no talk about the handkerchief, to my recollection.

MR. JONES. Q. Now, were you not asked, in the course of conversation, to swear the handkerchief was left there on a day when the prisoner was there? A. It might be so—I will not swear to what I cannot recollect—you will not make me swear what I do not recollect—it might have been said so.

COURT. Q. Were you not asked, "Cannot you prove this handkerchief was left at the time Caspar was at your house?" A. Yes, that was the case—it was left—that was the point, that I should identify Moss, which I would not do.

MR. JONES. Q. Did not Davis bring a handkerchief with him on that occasion? A. He did not—nor did Mrs. Abrahams, neither of them—no handkerchief was produced but this one, which I believe to be the handkerchief I found.

COURT. Q. Did either of them state to you that they were in a condition to prove the handkerchief left with you belonged to Moss? A. Yes, Mrs. Abrahams said so.

MR. JONES. Q. Can you tell how either Davis or Mrs. Abrahams knew that the handkerchief was left there? A. I told Mrs. Abrahams and Mr. Davis there was a handkerchief left by those people, by Mr. Caspar, here it is; and I showed it to them—they had not said a word about a handkerchief before I did—I will swear that they never mentioned a single word till I showed it—they then asked whether I recollected Caspar calling, with another gentleman with him, Mr. Moss—I said, "I don't know him, I knew Caspar from a child"—they said, "Do you know what has happened?"—I said, "I have heard there is some robbery"—they said, "You, remember he came to have some coffee"—I said, "Yes, Caspar came with another person, but I don't know him"—MRS. Abrahams described him, and said that he had whiskers before, and that he took the whiskers off—I said, "I can say nothing about it till you show me the man"—Davis gave me 2l.—I said, "Very well, I will receive this as a gift, but I must see the man before I swear to him—I did not return the money when I could not swear to him.

COURT. Q. Did you show them the handkerchief and say, "I cannot swear to the man until I have seen him, but I have a handkerchief that one of them I believe left?" A. No—they had been several times, but the; first time they came I was out, and I understood my wife had shown it to them—she looked at it and at last found a mark—Mrs. Abrahams said, "Oh, I believe he has lost a handkerchief"—Davis then gave me the 2l. to swear positively to Moss that I knew him, but I said, "I will go to the police-office;" but when I got there I did not know him, and would not swear to him—they asked me to swear that I saw him.

MR. JONES. Q. Did they ask you to swear Caspar was there? A. Yes, they did of course—I do not know whether it was before or after they asked me to swear that, that they gave me the 2l.—I could not deny Caspar being there, as I knew him—they asked me to state Caspar was there—I cannot say whether it was after that that they gave me

the 2l.—that is the only sum I have received from any person—if they had offered me 100l. it would be the same as 2l.—I was quite satisfied, I would not swear to any thing I did not know—I did not ask them for any more—they did not promise me any more—they promised me if I wished to do so that they would give me a 20l. note if I would identify Caspar, I mean Moss, but I would not.

Q. I ask you if they did not offer you a 20l. note to swear Caspar was there? A. I told you they, in the plural, they both were there—they did not ask me particularly to swear that the prisoner was there, but that both he and Moss were there—that was after Moss was taken up—I have never seen Davis since—I did not see him at Lambeth-street office—the only time I saw him was at my house, twice he called—I knew him from seeing him, but had not any particular knowledge of him—I will not swear I had not spoken to him before, but I never had any business with him, nor did I know what he was—I did not know he lived in Coventry-court till afterwards—I never went there—I kept the coffee-shop ten or eleven months—I was also an agent for foreign wines—my counting-house is 84, Lower Tower-street—I am still an agent for foreign wines—I do commissions—I am a general agent—before I went to Tower-street I kept a fancy toy-shop in Lowther Arcade—I was there eighteen months—I was always the same trade, a foreign agent in the wine trade, and so I am now.

Q. What do you mean? A. Suppose a foreigner comes over, having wines to sell, I have customers, and sell them, and my commission is five per cent—I have been a bankrupt, to my misfortune, only once, and obtained my certificate in 1824—I have twice taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act—the last time is three years and a-half ago—I believe the first time was about seven years ago—I was discharged the first time—I was remanded once I believe six or seven months, but I did not stop all the time out, because I settled with the detaining creditor—I was detained for defending an action without grounds—I have never been in the habit of becoming bail for people.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Can you tell how the prisoner, or any body belonging to him, knew any thing about Davis and Mrs. Abrahams coming to your house? A. I do not know—I was examined on the former trial when Mrs. Abrahams was charged—I was not then asked a word about the 2l.—I have heard that Davis is indicted with the rest—I never had any doubt that the prisoner was one of the persons who came to my house—I never attempted to swear Moss was the other man—they offered me 20l. to swear it—I did not know, at the time Davis and Mrs. Abrahams came to my house, that Mrs. Abrahams had had the gold dust through her hands—I never knew that either she or Davis had had any thing to do with it.





JAMES LEA
. I was an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 25th of March I remember the prisoner coming to the office and seeing Mr. Hardwicke, the Magistrate, about half-past two o'clock—he produced these two letters—(Nos. 3 and 4)—he said a serious robbery had taken place that morning, at Irongate Wharf, and that a person had come in a cab from Mr. March—he gave me a description of the mode in which it had been effected, that he had given it to a person who came in the name of Mr. March—I afterwards went to Irongate Wharf—he staid some few minutes with me at the wharf—he then left me, and said he could be of no further use to me—I staid some time, and then went to the office in John-street, and saw the prisoner—he opened a drawer, and produced

three or four letters of Messrs. Carries', and asked my opinion as to the writing, whether it did not correspond with the two letters I had before seen—he said he considered himself they were one and the same writing—I said, "No, they appear to me quite a different writing"—he then particularly drew my attention to Messrs. Carne's signature—I said that appeared to correspond with the others very much—he said it was principally on the faith of the signature he had given the order to the person for the boxes—I asked him at that time the description of the person who had been to receive the order—he said he was a man shorter than himself, grey whiskers, it appeared as if he had been a traveller, that he had a weather-beaten countenance—if I recollect right, he said he appeared to be about sixty years of age, and had grey hair—he laid he did not know him—he said he supposed, from what he stated, that he had come from Mr. March, and he did not know whether it was Mr. March or not—about eight o'clock that night I was at the Swan-with-two-Necks, making inquiry about the Falmouth coach, and while there, the prisoner and his father came in—he inquired about the Falmouth mail, and said he was going by the Falmouth mail—I made inquiry, and found the mail had been gone about a quarter of an hour before they came in—I told the prisoner I thought if he had a wish to go, be might overtake the mail at the Southampton rail-road—I went with them in a coach, but the mail had been gone about ten minutes I think—the mail goes by the rail-road—I do not think he had stated to me before, any intention of going to Falmouth—I have no recollection of it—he called at two or three coach-offices coming back, and said he should go next morning—as we returned, Ellis Caspar left the coach—I am not quite positive where he left it—I thought it was at Charing-cross, but it was between Charing-cross and St. Paul's—the prisoner said there would be hand-bills out next day, and 500l. reward offered—he said Mr. Allen, and Mr. De Mole were to have them printed—I expressed a wish to see Mr. De Mole before they were printed, and the prisoner requested his father to go immediately to prevent their being printed—I had been to the St. Paul's Coffee-house in the morning, and found three persons were putting up there from the Falmouth mail that day, and I went to see them—I called there again in the evening with the prisoner, after his father left—I gave a description of the person as the prisoner had given me, grey hair, and whiskers, a person, shorter than him, and about sixty years of age—he never contradicted me, or said that was not the person—there was a description given then, that such a person had been there—one of the three who had come by the mail—I think the waiter gave me that description, and the prisoner said that appeared the sort of description of the person—that person was described as about sixty years of age, with grey hair and whiskers—the prisoner also said he thought I could not do better than to pursue the inquiry there, and stick to the person at that house—he also told me the same thing, two days afterwards.

Q. How long afterwards did you trace the cab to New-street? A. The first cab I traced, when the prisoner was with me, in the Minories—I afterwards traced a cab to the neighbourhood of New-street, and went to a house in New-street, which had no tenant, and where a plate had been taken off the door—I have since ascertained that to be Moss's house—I found a quantity of nails in the grate, and some under the grate, and some in the dust-hole.


Q. Could you judge what had been burning in the fire-place? A. It appeared to me to be white wood ashes—there were several pieces of wood, and about sixty nails, which I produced at the last trial—some of the wood was partly consumed—I left them here at the last trial—I went to New-street three or four days after the robbery—I did not notice any sealing-wax—I afterwards went with Mr. Hartley to Mansel-street, and saw the prisoner, about five o'clock in the evening, with his father, nearly opposite Moss's house, in Mansel-street—I had some conversation with the prisoner afterwards—I took Mrs. Moss and Mrs. Levy into custody—I afterwards produced a box, found in a small room adjoining the bed-room—I ultimately produced five gold bars.

Cross-examined. Q. From what you saw of the prisoner, did not he appear anxious to afford you every assistance to find out the thieves? A. He appeared very uneasy when he came to the office about It—I should say he expressed great anxiety to find out the thieves for the first half hour—I saw very little of him after the first day—he did on the first day—he went with me to the wharf, and to the coffee-house—he was the first person I received information from of the jobbery—he did not describe the man as rather taller than himself, I understood him shorter—as far as my recollection serves me, I think he said shorter—I will not be positive—I stated on the last trial, that that was the description he gave—I obtained from the cat-men a description of the man who went to the wharf—that description did not correspond with the one given me by the prisoner—neither of them—Harland described him as a tall man, in black, and dark whiskers—I do not recollect Macbeth's description—he said nothing to me about grey hair—he did not describe him as about sixty years of age—I received a description from Blundell—he said he was a tall person with dark hair, and whiskers—the first cab-man I saw was Harland—I saw three altogether, but the first I have not mentioned, as I could not find his address—the prisoner went with me, when I saw that cab-man, who said he had been with a person to the office, in John-street, and put a person down at the Bank—I asked that person for a description of him, and he described him as a tall man, in black, and dark hair, and he thought he had the appearance of a Jew—he did not describe him as a man with grey hair, and whiskers, and that cab-man identified the prisoner as having come to our office in his cab—I said, "It is strange you should come here in the same cab"—it was not through the information I received from the prisoner that I traced the cabs—he said the man came in a yellow cab with four wheels—that was the only description of it—I never could find that cab-man out afterwards—the other two cab-men were examined at the office—neither of them stated, on seeing Moss, that he was not the man—the first cab-man was not examined, for I took his number down, and I expect I made a mistake in one of the figures, for I could not trace him out—the first cab-man did not see Moss in my presence.

COURT. Q. What time did the prisoner come to you in that cab said to be the same? A. About half-past two or three o'clock.

Prisoner. The first cab-man was examined, and said he could not recognise Moss, and so his deposition was not taken. Witness. I do not recollect any thing of that kind.

Prisoner. He lived in Gray's-inn-road. Witness. Yes, he gave me his direction, but I could trace no such person out.


MR. JONES. Q. Are you quite positive he was never examined at Lambeth-street? A. I do not recollect seeing him—I cannot say that he did not state Moss was not the man—I know nothing of it—I received the gold bars from Dean, Solomon's shopman, on the 17th of April—I left the Swan-with-Two-Necks in a coach, in company with the two Caspars, I think from ten minutes to a quarter after eight o'clock, and went to the Southampton railway at Queen's Elms—we got there in about half-an-hour, staid there about five minutes and then came back—we called at two booking offices in the Circus, St. James's-street, and another in Piccadilly—I think it must have been somewhere about nine o'clock when Ellis Caspar left the coach—it might be a quarter-past—it might be half-past, I will not pretend to say—we drove fast back—we went up Waterloo-place—we made no stay there—the prisoner got out and inquired about the coach—Ellis Caspar was not with me in St. Paul's church-yard I know—I cannot recollect precisely where he got out—I rather think it was between Charing Cross and St. Paul's church-yard.

Q. Supposing he got out at Charing Cross, how far is that from Moss's house, in New-street? A. Two miles and a half, I think—I do not think it is three miles—about two and a half—I think it is under three miles—we made no stop at either place coming back—we left the station at about twenty minutes before nine o'clock—it would take the best part of a quarter of an hour to get to Charing Cross—it is about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes' drive from Charing Cross to Queen's Elms—I am sure it was not ten o'clock when Ellis Caspar left us.

Q. Will you swear it was not a quarter to ten? A. I cannot swear to a quarter of an hour.





JOHN HOWARD
. I was employed by Lea, in March last, to watch some people about this robbery—I remember Good Friday—I do not know the day of the month—on that day I saw the prisoner with his father—I first of all followed the prisoner from Mr. Hartley's office in John-street to his own house in Finsbury-pavement—he went into the house and waited some time—shortly after, his father came out with him, and I followed them down to the office in John-street together—on the Monday following the 1st of April, I saw the prisoner with his father in Mansel-street about five o'clock—I know Moss's house in Mansel-street—they were about as far from Moss's house as I am from the door of this Court—I observed Ellis Caspar put his hand up, pointing to what appeared to me the apartments where Moss was living, lolling his head towards the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. Have you been in the habit of being employed in that way? A. On one occasion—I am now employed in the London Dock—I watched the prisoner's house on one occasion, but saw nothing—I was directed to follow him—I followed him to Finsbury-pavement, and on the door was written "Caspar"—I waited a considerable time and saw nothing—I have never said I watched their house from morning till night—I stated on the last trial that I watched the prisoners all 1 could, but never said about watching their house.





JAMES LEA

re-examined by
MR. JONES. Q. Did you make inquiry at Mr. Hartley's office of the different clerks there, as to the description of the man who went in the cab? A. I did—they did not all agree in the description—one of them differed—none of them described the man as having grey whiskers—I believe Mitchell gave a different description of him.

Q. Did you not swear on the last trial that Blundell described the man

precisely in the same way as the prisoner had? A. No, I do not recollect—one of Mr. Hartley's servants gave a different description of him—some said he was taller than the other, and different to what the other described him—it is possible one of them might have said something about grey whiskers—one of them, I do not recollect which, said he thought he had grey hairs in his whiskers—I do not recollect stating on the last trial that Blundell's description corresponded with the prisoners as to the whiskers—as near as I can recollect, I think it was Mitchell stated something about it—I remember one of them said he had grey hairs in his whiskers—I might have said Blundell's description corresponded with the prisoner's as to having grey hairs in his whiskers.

No 5. (read.) "London, 23rd March, 1839.—Messrs. W. and E. C. Came,—Dear Sirs, A most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters. On the other side I send a copy of them, and I beg that you will use your utmost exertions towards discovering the perpetrator. The impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves. The letters were posted at Falmouth on the 23rd, and arrived with this morning's manifest. Shortly after a gentleman called, requesting the delivery of two boxes marked "B C 18 and 19;" he showed me a letter which purported to be Mr. March's, or from him, I had not the slightest suspicion, and referred him to the wharf, writing an order for their delivery; unfortunately they were handed to him, and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue. Let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter. Believe me, dear Sirs, I am almost heart-broken. Yours very truly, L. CASPER. The man who called at my office appeared about fifty or sixty years of age, grey whiskers, middling stature, very dark complexion, swarthy, or very sunburnt, as an old traveller would appear, has a country dialect, as if from your parts. I think he was lame, as he walked very slow, or perhaps limped."





JAMES HANDS
 (police-constable K 248.) I was at Lambeth-street office on the 14th of June I think—I do not exactly recollect the date—the prisoner, Ellis Caspar, Mrs. Abrahams, and Moses were all four in confinement in one cell in the office—I heard the prisoner conversing with Moses—they were talking loud—I was not in a situation to see as well as hear—I heard the prisoner say to Moses, "Do you intend to let me have any money, I want 40l. or 50l. to prepare for my defence"—Moses answered, "No, I want four or five fifties to pay or prepare for my own"—the prisoner said, "Had I have had the 1400l. or 1200l. as you promised me, things might have been different"—Moses said "You are a b——rogue, you did not give him even what you had"—he did not mention who he meant by him—there was something said then which I did not hear, and I heard Moses say, "Did you ever give him 5l.?"

Cross-examined. Q. Were there any other persons than those you have mentioned confined in the cell? A. No, none but the four—there was not a drunken woman confined as well—there was no drunken woman in custody then, nor any woman—there was a drunken woman in the yard, but that was some time afterwards—the cell-door was shut when I heard this conversation—there were only those two talking—I did not hear the others speak—I was in the yard—I cannot exactly say how long—it might be a quarter of an hour, or five minutes more or less—my attention was taken by hearing them talk, and I went to the door to listen—I did

not go backwards and forwards while they were talking—I kept by the door—I cannot exactly say how long I was listening.

Q. When was the first time you told of this conversation? A. I communicated it in part within a few minutes after, to Cook, the gaoler, at Lambeth-street—he heard part of it himself, I believe—I stated that at the last trial, and at Lambeth-street, it might be an hour or two hours after I heard it—I had seen the prisoner before that day—I had been in the habit of standing, while he was under examination before the Magistrate, close to him—I had heard him speak before—I believe, with the exception of one examination, I heard him every time, which was, I think, six times—I heard him speak while his case was being heard—he was in conversation with his solicitor and others—I have never said there was so much confusion in the yard that I could not hear exactly what was said—I said I lost part of the conversation in consequence of an old man coming to draw water from a tap in the yard—I did not hear the prisoner ask Moses to lend him 5l., or that he had promised to lend him 5l.—that did not pass in my hearing.

Q. Did not you state on the last occasion that he said, "If I had got the 1200l. or 1400l., as you have, I would not have denied you?" A. The prisoner said that before the Magistrate—when I made the statement before the Magistrate, he admitted the conversation, but said he had said, had he got the 1200l. or 1400l., as he, Moses was said to have had, he should not have objected to let him have 5l.—that was the substance of the explanation he gave.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the prisoner's explanation a correct account of what passed, or was the account you have given on oath? A. The account I have given on oath.





ADOLPHUS FIESTELL

re-examined by
MR. JONES. My brother-in-law, Callaway, who was my waiter, appeared as a witness on the last trial—I was not present when he was examined—he was waiting on the day the prisoner and the other persons were at my coffee-house—he waited on them—I do not know where he is—I cannot find him—he left me nine months ago—I have not seen him since the last trial—I have not seen him about the Court to-day, nor since the trial—I have not spoken to, or seen him.





JAMES LEA

re-examined. I have made every inquiry to discover Callaway, to bring him here—I have been to all his relations in London—none of them know where he is—they said he was at Brighton, but did not know where there.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to Brighton? A. No; I did not know what part to go to, nor have I sent after him—I inquired of Fiestell where he was—he said he did not know—I did not hear Callaway examined at the last trial—I am sure I was not in Court when he was examined—I do not think I was in Court at the time.





WILLIAM BLUNDELL

re-examined. Q. Did you ever, and if so, at what time, inform the prisoner you had heard some of the gold dust had been found in Mansel-street? A. No.

Q. Did not you tell him Mr. Hartley was waiting at house in Mansel-street, or some such street, where he expected to find the thief, or some of the property? and did not you tell him you were going to take some letters to Mr. Hartley at a house in Mansel-street, where be expected to find some gold? A. I was going to the Green Man public-house, Mansel-street,

and told the prisoner I was going there, and that I expected to see Moss there—I told him that, when I went for the letters to the office—I cannot say when it was.

COURT. Q. How long after the 25th of March was that? A. Some few days, I think—I cannot remember—it might be a fortnight—somewhere thereabouts—I was going with letters to the Green Man public-house—I expected to find Mr. Hartley there, but he was not—Moss was to have been brought there, I understood—I did not see any thing of the gold—I did not describe to the prisoner who Moss was—whether they said Moss or the man whom they suspected had stolen the dust, I do not know.

Q. Who are they? A. The person by whom I was sent—somebody in the office—I believe it was the conversation in the office that Mr. Hartley was gone to the Green Man public-house, and they expected to find the thief there—whether I mentioned Moss by name, I do not know—I cannot say when I first heard the name of Moss in the transaction—it was in the afternoon that I told this to the prisoner—I was going to take the general-post letters which came that morning by the second delivery.

Q. Cannot you tell nearer than that it might be a fortnight after the 25th? A. I cannot say—I cannot say whether it might be longer or shorter—I cannot say whether it was the next day—I cannot say whether it was a week, or how long it was after—I believe nobody was present when I said this to the prisoner—it was in the back office—I went for the letters in the back office, and received the letters from him—I believe one of the clerks in the office told me they expected to find the man, and to take him to the Green Man public-house—I was examined on the former trial—I was not asked these questions then that I am aware of—I left the Court at six o'clock yesterday, and went to the office—I left there at eight o'clock, and went home—I have not given information since yesterday that I could prove this conversation with the prisoner—I have never given information about this to any body since the robbery—this is the first time I have been asked it—It have not told any one that I could prove it—I arrived here at nine o'clock this morning—I came by myself—I never communicated to the prisoner that I could prove this conversation, before he was taken into custody—he was in the office when I told him this, doing the duty of a clerk—I am not aware that I had any conversation with the prisoner in the evening of that day—I believe he had been in the office the whole of the morning on which I told him this—I think it was nearly three o'clock in the afternoon when I told him—I told him the letters I had in my hand I was about to take to the Green Man public-house, to Mr. Hartley, expecting the thief would be brought there that afternoon—I have never spoken or written to the prisoner since he was committed, nor seen his attorney or any body—I have-not spoken to the attorney to-day or yesterday.

Q. Did you ever tell Lea that the person who called in John-street on the 25th of March had grey hairs in his whiskers? A. No—I gave him a description of the person who called, the same as I gave this morning or yesterday, large black whiskers, and stooped as he walked—about fifty, I think, was the age I gave—I did not say he was lame, or that he appeared infirm from age—I said he stooped as he walked.

MR. JONES. Q. Did you describe the man to Lea as having grey whiskers?


A. I did not, nor grey hairs in his whiskers—I did not pet the prisoner at Mansel-street when I went there.

MR. JONES
called the following witnesses for the Defence:—





EDWARD CASPAR
. I am the prisoner's brother. I remember Sunday, the 24th of March, last year—my brother was at home that day—we all lived together at my father's house—he was in the habit of lying in bed rather late on Sunday mornings—he got up that Sunday morning from half-past ten to twelve o'clock—I think about eleven o'clock—he break-fasted after he got up—he dined at home that day—I think we dined about three or four o'clock—we usually dined about that hour on Sunday—generally on Sunday we dined later—I remember Mr. Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling to see my brother, about half-past twelve o'clock, and he staid till about three o'clock, or it might be later—my brother went out about four o'clock or half-past, between four and five—I would undertake to say he was in my father's house between one and two o'clock that day—I am quite certain of it—I am quite certain he did not go out from the time he got up till between four and fire o'clock—I was standing by his side nearly the whole of that time, looking over Mr. Wilson, who was teaching him drawing—he is a designer and draughtsman—my brother was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Manley, a friend—I cannot tell exactly what time he returned that evening—I do not know—he did not return very late—I always slept with him—we did not go to bed together that night, I went before him—I cannot tell what time he came to bed—I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and found him there—I got up tome time between seven and eight o'clock that morning, and left him in bed—I had to go up several times to call him that morning before he got up—I remember Mr. Riddington's man coming that morning, about a pair of boots—he came about ten minutes to nine o'clock—I did not go up and call my brother at that time—he came down to speak to the man within a few minutes to nine o'clock—he came down entirely in deshabille, in his slippers, and his coat across his arm—I cannot tell whether he had his breakfast after seeing Riddington's man, for I went out shortly after nine, o'clock—I left my brother at home then.

COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At No, 29, Finsbury-place—that is about twenty minutes, or half-an-hour's walk from Mr. Hartley's.

MR. JONES. Q. Were you in the habit occasionally of taking a sandwich to your brother? A. Every day I took it, from eleven to one o'clock, about one o'clock—I remember taking a sandwich to him at the office that Monday morning, I think, about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock, perhaps later, I did not notice the time—I saw him there—I saw a cab at the door, and thinking it might be my brother, I went up to it, and found it was a stranger—the cab-man grazed my leg against the step of the cab on his jumping down from the cab.


Q. Did you look into the cab, to be able to see the person in it? A. I looked particularly close, to see if it was my brother—I know Moss perfectly well.

Q. Was he the person in that cab? A. No—I am quite certain he was not—it was a yellow-bodied cab, with a black top, I believe, but I would not say that positively.

COURT. Q. The cab-man, getting down, grazed your leg; did you complain of the injury? A. Yes, I went into the office crying—I saw my brother, and then Mr. Hickey—I told them what was the matter—Mr. Hickey

asked me, and I told him the cab-man kicked me—I do not know whether Mr. Hickey is here.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where were you when your brother was tried before? A. I was about here the first day—the rest of the time I was at home—I was not in the best of health on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of last June—I was not confined to my bed—there was nothing the matter with my leg then—I knew Moss before this transaction, from taking him jobs.

Q. Are you the little boy who was in here yesterday and the day before, communicating with the prisoner? A. I was in a short time, and Mr. Robinson told me to go out—I only spoke to my brother once or twice at the utmost—I do not think I talked to him four or five times—I should not like to swear it—I have known Moss a very long time—he was not in the habit of coming to my father's house—he has not been often at my father's house—I might have seen him there once or twice, but merely as a workman in the shop—I do not know that he was ever in my father's employ at all—my father gave him jobs, which, I believe, he did in his leisure hours—I do not recollect seeing him for a long time before this Sunday, not for about two years, at our house—I am fifteen years old next month.

Q. Where was your father on this Sunday? A. He was at home also—I knew my father was being tried in June last for sharing this offence—and I knew he was at home all day that Sunday.

Q. Although you knew he was charged with being at Moss's? A. Yes—I did not come forward as a witness—I may have seen Moss occasionally at his house in New-street, Whitechapel—I do not know the number—I know the house, by being sent there by my father—I cannot tell whether his name was on the door, I did not notice—yes, I think it was—I cannot tell whether it was on a brass plate, it might or might not—I do not know whether it was or not—I might not have noticed his name at all, or I might have noticed it—I did not notice it—I do not know whether it was on the door or not—I had been there several times—the last time was, I dare say, about eighteen months or two years ago, I think eighteen months—I cannot tell how long I had known Moss living in New-street—I remember him for a long time—I do not remember ever going to any other house to him—I have known him at that house three or four years, or it may be longer—I have two brothers and six sisters—the prisoner is my eldest brother—two of my sisters are here, but not any brother—my younger brother is nine years of age—my sisters are older than me—my mother is living—she is not here—she dined at home with my father and brother that Sunday—she is at home, and she is distracted, poor creature.

Q. Now describe the dress of the man in the cab? A. I cannot tell his dress—he was not at all like Moss—I did not notice his dress—I think he had a great-coat on—I do not think he had a Macintosh over it—he had a hat—I cannot tell whether it was a light great-coat he had—I noticed his countenance more—I should not like to swear he had any great-coat—I did not notice his dress, but his countenance—I did not see him get out—I think it was about half-past eleven or half-past twelve o'clock—I generally went to my brother from eleven to one o'clock, before we dined—I will swear it was before one o'clock—I will not swear it was before twelve o'clock—it might have been half-past twelve o'clock—I am certain it was not one o'clock, because we generally dined about one o'clock, and I got

home some time before we had dinner—my leg was not injured, but hurt, by being kicked against—the man in the cab was a far older man than Moss—he seemed about sixty, I should think—I cannot tell what hair he had—he had grey whiskers—I did not notice that he stooped particularly—I did not hear his voice—I did not hear any thing he said—I did not see any body come out to him—the cab drove off as I went into the office—I did not go before the Magistrate—I was at home with my mother when my brother and father were charged before the Magistrate—the cab drove to the Minories.

COURT. Q. How came the man to get off the box when he was driving off? A. The cab was at the office door, and as I walked into the office it drove away.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. But the man would step on, instead of off; to drive away? A. The man was on the step of the cab talking to the person in the cab—he jumped down from the step of the cab, not off the box—I could not look inside the cab from the street, but I had a good view of the man—there was only one man, I am certain—I could see all inside the cab—the step was at the door of the cab—it was a low four-wheeled cab—I did not notice any boxes in it—I am quite sure there were no boxes in it—I cannot say whether the gentleman had a letter—my brother did not come out with him—he was in the office when I went in—the man was sitting in the cab—I think I should know the cab-man if I saw him—I was not before the Magistrates at all—the cab-man was a great big fellow, with red in his face—(looking at the witness Moss)—that is the man I know as Moss—he is well known to our family, and has been for some years—I should not take him for sixty years of age—I should say he is about thirty—my father was out on Monday night—I do not know what time he came home—I go to bed about eight o'clock, or between eight and nine.

Q. Do you know a man named Davis? A. Davis? no—I know several gentlemen of the name of Davis—I do not know Davis who lived in Coventry-court, and Oxendon-street—I do not know Mrs. Abrahams—I saw her when I went into Newgate to see my poor father—I went into Newgate to see my father the day he was committed—I knew the day he was tried—I did not come forward as a witness—I do not know why.

Q. Who brought you here to-day? A. I came myself—I have not had a subpoena—MR. Robinson told me to come—MR. Robinson did not examine me before I came here—nobody examined me before I came here—I told Mr. Robinson as nearly as possible what I had to say, a few days since—I think Monday week—that was the first time Mr. Robinson knew it—I did not tell him—I had told my brother previously, and it was written down—I do not know who wrote it down—I believe it was enclosed in the brief—MR. Robinson read it to me, and asked me if I knew every part of that.

Q. When, for the first time, did you tell this to Mr. Robinson? A. I mentioned about the cab directly I got home—I believe it is in the brief—I think I first told Mr. Robinson on Monday week—that was the first time I saw Mr. Robinson about it—I cannot say it was Monday week—it was one day in the last week—that was the first time I saw Mr. Robinson—MR. Yates was my father's attorney at the last trial—he knew it—I did not tell him.

Q. How do you know he knew it? A. The circumstance of the cab I ed when I got home, every body knew it.

Q. How do you know Mr. Yates knew the circumstances you have come to tell today? A. I have told him—I have been to Mr. Yates's—I did

not tell him formally all I bad to say, but I told him about the cab—I told him it was not Moss who came in the cab—that was before my father was tried—I did not see him take it down in writing—I went to Mr. Yates with my mother and sisters—my mother went to consult him and take him money for counsel—I was not brought here when my father was tried.

Q. Now, consider. A. I was here—I was in the yard the first day—I think I was not here the second day—I am afraid of swearing it—swearing is an awful thing for a boy like me—I might have been here on the second day—I think I was, on an errand to Mr. Yates—I was here on messages to Mr. Yates often—I do not think I was here the third day—I was not here every day of the trial—I was away two or three days—the third, fourth, and fifth days, I think, but when I was here I only came on an errand to Mr. Yates.

Q. On your solemn oath, were you not here waiting to be called as a witness? A. No, I was not—I never gave my evidence ready to be examined as a witness—I was not desired to be here.

MR. JONES. Q. Had you stated to Mr. Yates what you had said to your brother about his being at home? A. I merely stated the circumstance, and have said how cruel it was to say so and so about my brother, when I knew the contrary.

Q. Were you willing to come forward as a witness on the last trial, to state this if asked to do it? A. A place like this I was almost afraid of coming to, but on it being represented it was useful to my brother, I could not refuse to come.

Q. On your solemn oath, is what you have said about your brother being at home, true or false? A. Most certainly it is true—I would not swear a falsity—my poor mother is not in a state to come forward—MR. Robinson has very recently been engaged as attorney for my brother, instead of Mr. Yates—we have a servant named Sarah Cox—she and my sisters were all at home on the Sunday and Monday, at the time I have mentioned.

Q. Do you happen to know whether it was left to counsel on the last trial, whether they thought right to call witnesses or not? A. It was left to counsel entirely—my brother wished me to be called on the last trial, and now he has insisted on it.





ELLEN CASPAR
. I am the prisoner's sister. I remember Sunday the 24th of March last—my brother was in the habit of getting up late on Sunday mornings, sometimes at ten, and sometimes ten or eleven o'clock—on Sunday, the 24th of March, he got up between eleven and twelve o'clock—I remember his coming down stairs that morning about that time—he breakfasted after he came down—I remember a man named Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling that day to see my brother—I think he called before twelve o'clock—it was after my brother came down—he had some conversation with my brother—I do not recollect upon what subject—he left about three o'clock—the dinner cloth was being laid while he staid there—dinner was brought up while he was there, I think—he did not dine with us—he went away before dinner—the servant I remember, in laying the cloth, had to ask him to move, in talking to my brother, to enable her to lay the cloth—my brother dined with the rest of the family that day—he went out in the evening, about five o'clock—I can undertake to say he did not leave the house earlier than between four and five o'clock, and that he was there from one to two or three o'clock—he was not out

till between four and five o'clock in the evening—my brother Edward and he slept together—the prisoner had supper at home that Sunday night—we usually supped between eleven and twelve o'clock, about eleven—he came home early—I remarked his coming home particularly early that evening, but I do not know the hour—we went to bed at the usual hour that night—next morning, Monday, the 25th, he came down stairs a few minutes before nine o'clock.

Q. Do you remember whether there was any thing particular to require his coining down stairs? A. Yes, his boot-maker called that morning, and was waiting for him to have an answer about his boots, which he had brought home on Saturday night—when he came down he spoke to the boot-maker—he said he had not time to wait a moment—he came down with his coat over his arm, and his slippers on—he breakfasted at home that morning—he went out just about nine o'clock.

COURT. Q. Then he only came down a few minutes before nine o'clock? A. He came down just before nine o'clock, but very often he used to take a cup of coffee and run away—he did so that morning—he went away in a great hurry—it might be a few minutes before nine o'clock when he left, but it was on the stroke of nine—my brother Edward was in the habit of taking him a lunch every morning—he generally took it about ten or eleven o'clock, but sometimes it was not so exact—I remember my father coming home on Monday evening perfectly well—he came home from eleven to half-past eleven o'clock, but not later—I am quite sure of that—he went to bed with the rest of the family—I was ready on the last trial to state what I have now—I had stated it to Mr. Yates, my brother's attorney.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you here in attendance during the trial? A. No, not on any of the days—I was at home—my father was at home with my brother on the Sunday, talking to the said Mr. Wilson—I did not know that my father was said to be in another place on that Sunday—I knew he was described to be at Moss's house on Sunday—I knew he was at home.

Q. Why was it you did not come here to state it in the last case? A. Because the counsellors did not think it necessary witnesses should be called, I understood—MR. Riddington is the master boot-maker's name—I do not know where my brother Edward was when the man called from Mr. Riddington—the man waited in the parlour—my sister showed him in—I was there—I called my brother for him—I went and told my brother that Riddington's man was waiting for him—he came down on that, and went into the parlour to the man—that is the room he used to take his breakfast in—he did not talk to the man while he was having his break-fast.

Q. Did he take any breakfast? A. He took a cup of coffee, as well as I can recollect, but he was very late that morning—he merely swallowed a cup of coffee and went out almost as soon as he got in the parlour—he told the man he could not wait to try them on that morning, and then left the house I think while the man was there—I did not see my brother Edward go out with the lunch that morning—I did not give him the lunch—we sometimes breakfasted before my brother—sometimes we breakfasted earlier than he rose—on that morning we were breakfasting when he came down—the family were sitting at breakfast when he came down—myself, my mother, and Edward—we were having breakfast together—being late that morning, breakfast

was nearly done when Riddington's man came—Edward and all the family were sitting at breakfast when I went up stairs to call my brother—I left them at the breakfast-table, but I must name to you, that we did not break-fast in the parlour where Riddington's man came in, but in another parlour.

MR. JONES. Q. Was Edward at breakfast with you and the family that morning? A. Yes—I did not take any notice of what passed between my brother and Riddington's man—at least I do not think he satisfied the man, he had not time to answer him—I was not at home in the middle of the day on Monday—I saw my father on Monday morning—the latest time I saw him on Monday morning was between ten and eleven o'clock, I think—he was in the habit of attending to the shop throughout the day, unless he had occasion to go out.

COURT. Q. What is his shop? A. A clock and watch manufactory—my brother sometimes has a sandwich for his lunch, or sometimes bread and cheese, any thing there was—he did not take it with him—Edward used to take it to him—he very seldom took it himself—he used to say he would do without any, but we nearly always used to send him lunch, and we used to send it as early as we could to him—John-street is about twenty minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour's walk—we sent every day—he never took it himself—it was sent wrapped up in paper.

MR. JONES. Q. Was the lunch generally sent by his direction, or through the anxiety of your mother? A. Through the anxiety of my mother, for fear he should be faint—he said there was no occasion for it, and that was the reason he did not take it himself.





GRACE CASPAR
. I am the sister of Ellen Caspar. I remember Sunday, the 24th of March—my brother got up about eleven o'clock, or a little after—he and Edward slept together—he breakfasted when he came down that morning—while he was there Mr. Wilson called to see him—he is a draughtsman, and a clock-case maker—it was between twelve and one o'clock, about half-past twelve o'clock I think, when Mr. Wilson called—he remained till the dinner cloth was laid, which was between three and four o'clock—he went away before we dined—from eleven till three o'clock, when Mr. Wilson left, my brother did not leave the house—he was not dressed to leave home till after—he dined with us that day, and waited till five o'clock—he agreed to wait for Mr. Wilson till five o'clock, and if he did not call about five o'clock, he was to go out without him—it must have have been after five o'clock when he went out—I cannot recollect his coming home that evening—I do not remember having supper that night—I went to bed before supper—my brother might have returned before I went to bed—he generally supped with us—my father got up the same time as usual on Sunday morning—he breakfasted with us—we breakfasted at eight o'clock that morning—my father did not go out before dinner that day—he was also engaged with Mr. Wilson—I will undertake to say positively my father was at home between one and two o'clock that day—I do not remember any body calling to see my brother on Monday morning, but the shoemaker, who lives opposite—the man's name is Allen—the master is Mr. Riddington—Allen called about nine o'clock, a few minutes before or after nine o'clock—my brother came down to see him—he had his slippers on when he came down, and his coat thrown over his arm—he spoke to the man, and tried the boots on—I cannot say whether they fitted him, because I went out of the room—I came into the room a few minutes after—I saw him with the boots, whether

he did try them on I cannot say—he spoke to the man about them—the man did not remain long—my brother breakfasted after he had done with the man—he went out as near as I can recollect, at a quarter after nine o'clock, a few minutes more or less—it was past nine o'clock I am positive—his usual time for breakfast was a quarter before nine o'clock—he used to tell the trades people not to call after nine o'clock—he was rather later than usual that morning.

Q. On the Sunday, do you remember whether your father was at home? A. Yes, he was at home—he did not go out at all on Sunday—he was at home on the Monday, except going to his work-shop, which is a few doors off—he was only absent a few minutes—he did not go out for any length of time in the day time—he was at home as late as twelve or one o'clock—he had not gone out before that on Monday—Sarah Cox was our servant at that time.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you the same servant now? A. Yes, she is here—I was ready to be called as a witness for my father when he was tried—I have known Moss by sight a long while—I cannot say how long—six or seven years, as long as I can recollect—I do not know where he used to live—I might have been at his house—I am not sure—I might have taken a job there for my father—I have not been often—I have not been six or seven times, nor four or five—I think I have been once or twice—it was in New-street, Whitechapel—it is somewhere about two years ago that I went there—my father was at home all Sunday—he did not go out at all on Sunday—not in the evening—I knew that when he was being tried, and I knew he was charged with being at Moss's house on Sunday.

Q. You never came forward? A. We expected we should have to come, but were not called—it was about nine o'clock when my brother got up on Monday—that was later than usual—we breakfasted at the usual time that morning, eight o'clock—we breakfasted down stairs in the kitchen that morning, not in the back or front-room—we breakfasted between eight and nine o'clock—Riddington's man came about nine o'clock, after we had breakfasted.

Q. After the breakfast things were all done? A. Yes, they might have been—it was after we had done breakfast—the things were gone—he was shown into the parlour even with the shop—he did not wait many minutes—I told my sister, and she called my brother—I told her as soon as Allen came, and she went and called him—he came with a very few minutes—our breakfast was over at the time I sent my sister to call him, but he did not breakfast with us—when he came down he went to Allen—I staid in the back-room a little time, while he was talking with the man about the boots—I cannot say where my brother had his breakfast—if he had it it must have been after Allen was gone—he breakfasted I know—he usually had toast and coffee—he might have had that that morning—I believe he did breakfast that morning—it was there for him, and he sat down to breakfast—I do not know how long he was at breakfast—I suppose about a quarter of an hour, he might have been—he was in his slippers when he came down stairs—he went out in boots—he put on his boots in the parlour—I cannot say whether that was before or after breakfast—I saw him try on his new boots—he was talking to the man about them about ten minutes—he went and had his breakfast after that in the kitchen—he was called down to Riddington's man—if he had been down at his usual

time we should not have had to call him—my father breakfasted with us that morning in the kitchen—MR. Wilson merely came in casually, and while there he drew some patterns of clock-cases—he agreed to come to my brother at five o'clock—I do not know what for.

MR. JONES. Q. Did you happen to see your brother take breakfast? A. His breakfast was there, I am not sure he took it—I believe he did—I opened the door, and told my sister to call him—I do not know that anybody went up stairs to call him—we called at the stairs to him, and he came down—Edward might be there—very likely he was, he was in the house.





SARAH COX
. I live with Mrs. Caspar, and have done so fifteen months—I was there in March last year—the prisoner was in the habit of getting up very late on Sunday mornings, between eleven and twelve o'clock in general—I remember Sunday, the 24th of March, he got up about eleven o'clock that morning—he had his breakfast at home—he breakfasted when he came down stairs by himself—Edward slept with him—I remember Mr. Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling to teach him drawing in the clock-cases—he called about half-past twelve o'clock—he remained till between three and four o'clock, the time I was going to lay the dinner-cloth—I am quite certain the prisoner had not left the house that morning up to that time—I cannot recollect whether his father had—he was there while Mr. Wilson was there—I do not know whether he went out Before Mr. Wilson left—I was in all parts of the house—the kitchen was my place—they were in the parlour—MR. Caspar was at home when Mr. Wilson called, and when he went away—he dined at home that day—the prisoner went out at five o'clock—I remember his coming home—I do not exactly know the time—he supped at home, and went to bed at the usual time—I do not remember any one calling to see him next morning—he came down at nine o'clock, or a few minutes to nine.

Q. Did he speak to any body when he came down? A. He spoke to the bootmaker—the bootmaker called to see him—I thought you meant a gentleman—the bootmaker's journeyman called about nine or ten minutes to nine o'clock,—the prisoner came down, with his coat hanging over his arm, and his slippers on—he spoke to the boot maker in the parlour for a few minutes, and the boot maker went away—the prisoner led the house after breakfast—after the bootmaker was gone he had breakfast, and left the house—I should say it was half-past nine o'clock when he left—I am sure it was after nine o'clock'—he generally used to go a little after nine o'clock—he went about the usual time that morning—on Tuesday and Friday mornings he used to go out early—when vessels were going off he went about seven o'clock—I remember seeing Mr. Caspar, my master, that morning—I do not remember whether he went out at all that morning—I saw him there at breakfast, between eight and nine o'clock, and I saw him there after breakfast—he dined at home—he was at home from breakfast to dinner-time—they dined about two o'clock—I am sure he did not go out from breakfast to dinner-time—he went out in the evening, I cannot say the exact time, it was getting candle-light—he came home between eleven and twelve o'clock in the evening—he had supper at home that night, and went to bed—it was some time between eleven and twelve o'clock when he came home—we were all up stairs and in bed at twelve o'clock—the clock struck twelve as I was going up stairs.


Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did the family usually breakfast? A. In the kitchen—the door is not one which people come to without knocking—I did not answer the door when the bootmaker's man came—one of the family did—I was in the passage sweeping—some of the family were in the parlour, and some in the kitchen—I do not know what those in the parlour were doing—they had breakfast in the kitchen—the bootmaker came while I was in the passage—he was asked into the parlour by the person who let him in—I do not recollect who let him in, I believe it was one of the daughters—I did not go up stairs to tell the prisoner the bootman was come—one of the daughters did—he came down directly—his coat was hanging over his arm—he had slippers on—I was in the passage when he came down—I undid the parlour door—I went into the parlour—he tried on the boots, and spoke to the man about them—I do not know what he said—the bootmaker's man went away—I do not remember who let him out—I recollect the prisoner then going to breakfast in the kitchen—he had coffee—he took his breakfast, I know—that occupied about a quarter of an hour, and then he went out.





ALFRED WILSON
. I am a clock-case maker, and live at No. 19, King, street, Clerkenwell—I am not a housekeeper, but a lodger—I have lived there two years and better. I knew the elder and younger Mr. Caspar—I remember calling at Mr. Caspar's house on the 24th of March last—I was there about ten minutes after twelve o'clock—I saw the elder Caspar and the younger one, and the young son and the daughters—I had some conversation with them—I was there till after three o'clock, till their table was laid for dinner, and then I left.

Q. What were you doing from twelve till three o'clock? A. I was drawing clock-cases, little patterns in a book, for the elder Mr. Caspar to use as a pattern-book, and for the instruction of young Edward Caspar—when I first went the elder Mr. Caspar was in the shop, doing something to a watch—I went into the back parlour behind the shop, told him my watch was bad, and I had called, agreeable to promise, to give his son a lesson in drawing—I staid there I dare say three quarters of an hour, and while I was waiting there the prisoner came down, and made some remarks on my drawings, and pointed out something I should correct in them——I had not seen the prisoner till then—he was not dressed, he had his coat off—it must have been past half-past twelve when I first saw him that morning—I left about three o'clock.

Q. Were you in company with him from the time you first saw him till you went away? A. I was in company with him when he came down first, then he went up stairs again, and came down and staid with us nearly an hour before I came away—I can swear he was in the house from one to two o'clock that day—I cannot say whether he had any breakfast after he came down—the elder Mr. Caspar was with me all the time I was there, and was repairing my watch—I can swear that he was in the house from one to two o'clock—the prisoner very much pressed me to come at five o'clock, and he would wait at home for me, and I was to finish a drawing, and take it with me—he has often purchased clock-cases of me, and paid me for them—I cannot say whether he learned the watch trade or not—I had called at the house on other Sundays—I have seen the prisoner very much about the same time on several Sundays when I have been there, and I have seen him up very early on Sunday also.

——RIDDINGTON. I am a bootmaker, and live at No. 15, Finsbury-place North, very nearly opposite Mr. Caspar. I made the prisoner two pairs of boots—I remember Saturday, the 23rd of March last, I have it down in my book—I sent him some boots that day—I sent Allen to the prisoner about them on Monday morning, from half-past eight to nine o'clock—he returned to me with a message between half-past eight and nine o'clock—I am positive as to the time.
---- ALLEN. In March last I was in the employ of Mr. Riddington. I remember taking a pair of boots home to the prisoner on Saturday, the 23rd of March—I went to him on Monday morning—it was within a few minutes of nine o'clock—I saw his two sisters, and afterwards saw the prisoner come down stairs—he had on a pair of dark trowsers, and was in his shirt sleeves, and a pair of morning slippers—I had a little conversation with him about the boots, for to the best of my recollection the boots did not fit him—to the best of my recollection I took them away, and returned to my master's shop—I suppose I remained in the house about five or six minutes—I was shown into the parlour at the back of the shop.

COURT. Q. What makes you recollect the 25th of March in particular? A. It was the morning the robbery was committed—I cannot exactly say how soon after I heard of it—I do not know that I heard of it the same day, but very soon after.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you here as a witness at the trial of Ellis Caspar? A. No, I was called on by the Caspar family—I did not refuse to come, but I was not subpoenaed, so I did not come—I know of no other reason why I did not come.

to
MR. RIDDINGTON. Q. Were you here on the last trial? A. No, I was not subpoenaed—I was not asked to come—I had not given my evidence to any body—I had not seen Mr. Yates, the attorney—I would have come if I had been called on to come.

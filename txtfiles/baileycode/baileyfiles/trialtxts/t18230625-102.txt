            , of Cranbourne-street


. On the 27th of May, the prisoner came and bought a lace cap, at 10 s. 6 d., paid 6 s. deposit, and at half-past six o'clock she called again, and paid the 4 s. 6 d., and asked to see some lace - I shewed her several lengths in a basket, and cut her off a yard at 3 s.; she paid 1 s. on it, and went away, and in a minute I missed two pieces of lace - she left a key behind her. She came again next evening at half-past six, and asked for the lace, paid for it, and bought a yard more. I turned my head occasionally to get things, and missed a piece of lace anda cap. I sent for a constable, who took her up stairs, and brought down three pieces of lace and a cap.

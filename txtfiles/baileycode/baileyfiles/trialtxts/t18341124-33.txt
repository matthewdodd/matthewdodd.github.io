JOHN CARTER, alias
 Thompson

 Was again Indicted

 for that he, on the 
11th of November, feloniously did forge a request for the delivery of 28 pounds weight of white lead, and 1 mop, with intent to defraud 



Thomas Barrow.—2nd COUNT. For feloniously uttering, disposing of and putting off a like forged request, well knowing it to be forged, with a like intent.






THOMAS BARROW
. On the 11th of November, the prisoner came and produced this order—I delivered him 38 lbs. of white lead and a mop, on account of William Peascod, the master of the ship Hunter (read)—I believed it to be the genuine order of Captain Pescod—he was a customer of Miss Inwood's many years—I was not in her employ before I married her—I let him have the goods—he made a verbal application at another time for more goods—I let him have the goods, believing he came from Captain Pescod.

Prisoner. I did not represent that I came from Captain Peascod. Witness. I am quite certain he did.





WILLIAM PESCOD
. I am captain of the Hunter. I did not write this order, nor authorise it to be used, nor did I receive the goods it was not written by my authority at all—it is forged in all respects—I never employed him to obtain goods from Inwood on my account.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not write the order.




GUILTY
. Aged 44.—


Transported for Seven Years.

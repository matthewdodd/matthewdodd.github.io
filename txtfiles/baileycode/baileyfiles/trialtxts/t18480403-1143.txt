CHARLOTTE M'BETH.
—I am wife of William M'Beth, of Pimlico. On 23rd March, about one o'clock, I was in Strutton-ground—I had this bag (produced) twice round my wrist and once round my finger—it contained two purses, and about 5s., in shillings and sixpences—the prisoner came up and took it violenly—he tore my glove and handkerchief, and made my finger very sore—he ran down Pear-street—I am sure he is the man.






MARGARET SMITH.
 I saw the prisoner snatch the bag—I am sure he is the man—I followed a little way, crying "Stop thief!" but went back to assist the prosecutrix, as she seemed fainting.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (policeman.) I pursued the prisoner in Pear-street—he threw this bag away—he ran half-a-mile and could run no farther—I could not mistake him, as he fell in the mud.




GUILTY.**† Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

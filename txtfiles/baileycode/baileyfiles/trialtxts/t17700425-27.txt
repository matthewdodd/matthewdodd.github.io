            . I live on the top of Hedge-lane








. My house was broke open on the 13th of Jan






. My servant maid told me of it in the morning, about eight o'clock, before I was up. I found the shutters of the parlour window wrenched open; I imagine with a chissel, and the sash was lifted up, and the blind taken away. I missed a silver watch from the mantle-piece, and two coats out of the same room. It was one o'clock before I left that room to go to bed; all was safe then. I went and informed Sir John of my watch, and on the 5th of this instant Sir John sent for me: there I saw it again. I was sent with a constable to Golden-lane, to see for my other things. (The prisoner was then in custody). There were two women in the prisoner's house; we looked about, and found other things, but nothing belonging to me. We went up into the old woman, the mother's room, and, in a box, I found the chain of my watch. I went to the prisoner in Newgate last Tuesday, and said to him, if he had pawned my clothes I would be glad if he would let me know, that I might have them again: he said he had sold them to an old clothes man, and I could not have them again.

            . On the 5th of this instant, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner had entered a house in the Strand, and got up stairs, and I took him, and before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             this watch was found upon him (produced in court). Sir John sent for the prosecutor, as he had been and described the watch to Sir John: he came and swore to it. Then we were ordered to go and search the prisoner's house in Golden-lane: the prisoner had lately lodged in Hedge-lane, but removed at Lady-day last. In searching the old woman's room, in a box, we found this watch chain. (Produced in court).
Prosecutor. This watch and this chain are my property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was taken before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . They took this watch from me. I told them I bought it. There were three of them; two of the three are now in custody that I bought it of. Sir John asked me where I lived; I told him directly. I told Sir John, if he would admit me an evidence, I could be of great service to the public. He has got a writing I drawed up: he told me if I could discover a robbery that had been done since I had been in prison, I should have great favour shewed me. The prosecutor asked me whether I had his clothes; I told him I bought them all together. I put the other chain to the watch. It is what I had had three years.

            . I have known the prisoner near ten years. He served his time to me, to the business of a silversmith
. He has been gone from me upwards of two years. I can give no account how he has lived since.
Q. How did he behave while with you?
E. Bateman. I dismissed him from my service two or three times.

            . I live in Newport-street, Leicester-fields






: my house was broke open on Tuesday the 15th of January. On the Wednesday morning I was awaked by a violent rapping; between five and six the watchman called me to come down. I went down, and found the window, next to where the side-board stood, was broke open; the shutter was flung back; the iron bolt was broke in two, and three or four panes of glass broke, in order to unscrew the screw within side; the window is above the area. They stood upon the iron pallisades, in order to break it open. The only things I missed, were the knives and forks and the case they were in. After it was day-light, I wrote a letter to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , acquainting him with the robbery, and description of the knives and forks. I heard nothing of it till about a fortnight or three weeks ago, when I received a letter, wherein Sir John tells me, he believed the knives and forks were in his custody, and he desired to see me. I went on the Monday morning; there I saw my knives and forks, and swore to them, and he bound me over to prosecute.

            , from New Prison, telling the mother to secure the things. The old woman ran up stairs, and brought down a handkerchief, with a silk gown and a linen one in it, and went to run away. We went and took her back into the house, after she was got some distance from the street-door. The gowns are not yet owned. Then in looking about I found this box; there was those sheets, pillow-biers, and napkins in the box. Sir John ordered us to lock them up in a closet, and he sent to the persons that had applied to him that had lost things. The pillow-biers were marked with a coroner. (The sheets, a quilt, two napkins, three pillow-cases, a draft-board, and some books produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)

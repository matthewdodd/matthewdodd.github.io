WILLIAM BUTLER
 (police-sergeant B 3.) About a quarter to three o'clock on Sunday morning, the 13th of Oct., I met the prisoner carrying a bundle on his head. I stopped him, and asked what he had got—I took him to the station, and found the articles stated on him—they were given up to the prosecutor.





MARY RUST
. I am in the service of George Hawkins, of Canterbury-street, Lambeth. The things produced by the officer were lost from our safe—we lost all that exactly, and I am able to swear it was my master's property—it was the same in quality and appearance—the basket is not ours.




GUILTY
.** Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

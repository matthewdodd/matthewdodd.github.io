                  Blair
               



            , who lives in Devonshire-place


, the prisoner was our butler
. On the 15th of December Plank brought the articles stated in the indictment to me, which had been missed-the prisoner was still in our service. We had him apprehended.
JAMES ALDOUS. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. On the 15th of December the prisoner came to pledge four table spoons; he asked 3l. for them, I told him it was too much, he said they were new. On examining them I saw a crest had been erased, I told him so. He asked to look at them, and tried to get them foreibly from me. I detained them, telling him that was not the act of an honest man. I sent for Plank, who secured him. He said he bought them of a pawnbroker, in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square.
SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer. I secured the prisoner. He refused to tell where he lived, he at last told me. I took him to Mrs. Blair's, and went to his lodgingsin South-street, Manchester-square, and found a candlestick and a pair of snuffers.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress. I intended to redeem them.

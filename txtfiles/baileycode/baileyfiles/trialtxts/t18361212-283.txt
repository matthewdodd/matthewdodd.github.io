MR. JOHN LLOYD
. I live in Woburn-place. My great coat hung in my hall on the evening of the 12th of December—I saw it about six o'clock—this is it—it was brought to me on Tuesday morning.





EDWARD SMITH
. I keep the private gate at Woburn-place. At twenty minutes past eight o'clock, on Tuesday morning, the 13th, I saw Warren come out of Mr. Lloyd's house with something like this on his arm—he joined Williams, who was about two doors off, and they walked on—I went and spoke to the servants, and then went after the prisoner, and met Steele—he and the policeman went after them.





HENRY STEELER
. I am a gentleman's servant. I went with the policeman and found the prisoners—I caught Warren, and Williams had got this coat under his arm—he was a little before him.





THOMAS COOP
 (police-constable E 27.) I went after the prisoners and found this coat under Williams's arm.
(William received a good character.)

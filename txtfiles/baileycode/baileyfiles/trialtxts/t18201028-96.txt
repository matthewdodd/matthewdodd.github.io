            . I am watchman of All Saints, Poplar


. On the 26th of September, about two o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner on Hoard's premises, and asked what he did there, he said he came to get some water. I saw the bucket in his hand and the vice on his shoulder. I went up to him, he threw them down. He said he was going to get water from the well. I knew there was no well there. He ran into a field and I secured him without losing sight of him.

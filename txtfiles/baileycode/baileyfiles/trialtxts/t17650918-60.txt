            : we keep a silversmith's shop
, in Sidney's-alley, Leicester-fields


, and deal in medals, and such things, in silver or gold. On the 25th of July, about five in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came and asked me to see some buttons, that were in a drawer where the medal lay, under a glass-case, in the window: I took in the drawer; the prisoner and one Arkle came in, and looked at the buttons: they bid me a price for a pair, which they might imagine I could not take: I refused it, and they went out of the shop. After that, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Holland 
               



            , that lives at the next door, came and asked me if they had bought any thing? I said, no: he said, he was afraid they were common pick-pockets. I looked in the drawer, and missed the gold medal; it was a King William and Queen Mary's coronation medal: I saw it in the drawer, when I went to show them the buttons.

                  Holland 
               



            . I was standing near the prosecutor's shew-glass, talking to a young man; the prisoner and another came to the glass, where I saw the medal lying: I saw them point at it; the other said, it would just do for him, and bid the prisoner look who was in the shop; he answered there was a Monisher in the shop; I suppose a cant word for a woman: Mrs. Storey was there: they went in; then I went into the house where I live; they came out in about three or four minutes: I went after them to the corner, and saw them running along Leicester-fields as fast as they could: I came back, and asked Mrs. Storey whether that medal was gold? she said it was she looked, and it was gone. This was on a Thursday, and on the Saturday, I saw the prisoner and two or three more go through the court: I told my father, who went and told Mr. Storey to go and take him.

                  Storey 
               



            . I was not at home when the medal was lost. The night the prisoner and others came through the court, Mr. Fossey, Holland's father-in-law, came and told me; we ran and took him in Coventry-street, and brought him into my shop. I asked Mrs. Storey if she knew him? she said yes; and when he spoke, she said she could swear to his voice. We took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and had him search'd; four handkerchiefs were found upon him, and he was committed. In a fortnight after, my son and apprentice went to the Gatehouse; there was a letter wrote to Mrs. Tree, by the prisoner's order, informing her, that the medal was gold, and worth 40 s. I got a warrant to search Mrs. Tree's house, and took her before Major 
               
                  Spinnage
               


            ; there she told me she would take me to the place where my medal was: she took me to a young woman that was servant to Mr. Richardson, printer, in Fleet-street, who told me the medal was sold to Mr. Sarjant, goldsmith, in Fleet street.


                  Mary 
                  Tree 
               



            . I live in Bennet's-court, Drury lane. 
               
                  Edward 
                  Arkle 
               



             shewed me the medal, and asked me if I knew what it was, or whether it was gold? I shewed it to a relation, who could not inform me. Arkle said he would go and shew it to a silversmith; he came back, and said he had, and the gentleman said it was gold. I never saw it afterwards.
Q. Have you seen the prisoner with Arkle?
Tree. He has come to my house two or three times with him.

                  Emmerson 
               



            . I did live with Mr. Richardson; I lost my place on this account. I was standing at the bottom of our entry, at the street, and Arkle came and asked me how I did; (he was brother to one that I know); he said he had been tossing up in the market, and had found this piece, and shewed me the medal; I did not know what it was; he desired me to ask somebody what it was; this was about six or seven at night, but cannot tell the day: I went to a silversmith, and asked him; he said it was gold: he weighed it, and said it came to 1 l. 19 s. 6 d. I was sent to change it for Arkle, if it was gold; then I desired a young man to go over the way to Mr. Sarjant with it, along with me: we sold it for 43 s. the money was paid to me, and I gave it to 
               
                  Edward 
                  Arkle 
               



            .


                  George 
                  Curry 
               



            . I live with Mr. Ryall; in Fleet-street; the last witness desired me to go with her to sell this medal: I went with her to Mr. Sarjant, and we sold it for 2 l. 3 s. Mr. Sarjant put the money on the counter, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Emmerson 
               



             took it up.


                  Benjamin 
                  Sarjant 
               



            . Curry came with the medal alone to me, and asked me the value of it; I told him; I believe he had not been gone ten minutes. before he came again with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Emmerson 
               



            , and said, you are to have the medal. I took out the money I had told him to be the value of it, 43 s. and laid it down on the counter, and the young woman took it up. (Produced in court, and deposed to by Prosecutor).
Q. to Emmerson. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
Emmerson. I never saw him before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was not along with Arkle when the medal was stolen; I came from Birmingham, and never was acquainted with Arkle but three times in my life.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the shop

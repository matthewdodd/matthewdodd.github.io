                  THOMAS 
                  BARTHOLOMEW
               



             sworn. - I am a lighterman
: On the 13th of April, I went from Shadwell to Blackfriars to see some friends, and I drank a little drop of liquor too much; about a quarter after eight o'clock I parted with them, and went towards Shadwell, and coming near Wellclose-square these two women picked me up; they took me into a house in North-east-passage, Wellclose-square


.
Q. Were both the women in the room? - A. At that time they were both in the room; afterwards I missed Dugan out of the room; then I had some suspicion that I had missed my watch; I then said to 
               
                  Louisa 
                  Burgoine
               



            , I have lost my watch; I told her I would not depart from the place, nor she should not, till I had my watch; while I was talking to her, another woman, and a black fellow about six feet high, came in, and demanded me out of the room, they turned me out. As soon as I got out of the house, I called for assistance; a man jumped out of his house, and asked me what was the matter; I told him I was robbed of my watch; he called the watchman, and we went in search of the prisoners; we found Dugan at the next door; I saw Burgoine on Monday morning, and Dugan, at the Office.
Q.Did you ever see your watch again? - A. Yes, on Monday morning, in the possession of Mr. Matthews, a pawnbroker.
Q. Were you sober enough to be sure of the persons of these two women? - A. Yes, I am very positive to these two women, and I am sure I had my watch when I went into this house.
Prisoner Dugan. This man met me, and I asked him for some money; he gave me the watch instead of money, and told me to make money of it.
Court. Q. The question is, whether you gave her the watch instead of money? - A. You may depend upon it I did not; I had a seven-shilling piece, some silver, and a dollar.

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Matthews, a pawnbroker, in the Minories: On the 13th of April, in the evening, 
               
                  Louisa 
                  Burgoine
               



             pledged this watch for thirty-five shillings, to the best of my knowledge, in the name of 
               
                  Anthony 
                  Polycock
               



            ; I produce the watch.

                  CUDWORTH
               



             sworn. - I am a headborough: On Sunday morning, the 14th of April, I saw both the prisoners at the watch-house; Burgoine and Dugan had some words; one accused the other of having the duplicate; I insisted upon having the duplicate, and Dugan gave it to me; I went on Monday to the pawnbroker's with the prosecutor, and there we found the watch. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.)
Dugan's defence. This man came up to me in Wellclose-square, and asked me where I lived, and I told him; he asked whether he could come home with me, and I told him he might if he liked; when he came in, 
               
                  Louisa 
                  Burgoine
               



             was in the room; he asked me who that was, and I told him it was an acquaintance; he said he had no money, but he would give us his watch to make money on till he returned; I took the watch, and by the time I came back he was gone; I pawned the watch for thirty-five shillings, and gave up the ticket.
Burgoine's defence. I was in the room when 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



             came in with this gentleman, and I walked out; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



             called me back, and I went in again; my dear, said he, I want you, I will make you a handsome compliment; after that we asked him for the money; he searched his pockets, and not finding any, he handed the watch to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



            , and said, go and make money on that till I release it; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



             went, and I staid in the room with him some time; he then said he had lost his watch; I asked him if he had not given the watch to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



             to pawn; I saw him give it into her hands; the gentleman saidI must go down stairs, and find 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



            ; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Dugan
               



             came back with the watch in her hands; she told me she could not get into the shop, it was so full; we went together to Mr. Matthews's, in the Minories, and pledged it for thirty-five shillings; we were going home to go to-bed, about three o'clock in the morning; the watchman said that we had stole the watch, and we were taken to the watch-house.

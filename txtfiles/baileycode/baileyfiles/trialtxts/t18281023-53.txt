THOMAS READ KNOTT. I have been a waiter
, but am out of place. On the 25th of September I lived at Richmond; I was in Fleet-street


 about seven o'clock in the evening, going towards Temple-bar; I felt something at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner, and another behind him; I laid hold of him, and my handkerchief was gone - I found it in his right-hand trousers pocket; his companion ran away: he began crying, andhoped I would let him go - I gave him to a constable - his companion was about eighteen years old - I think I should know him again.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to the watch-house, and met the prisoner being brought there; he cried very much, and said he was very sorry - that he had been deluded by a person named Williams, who lived at No. 6, Little Saffron-street, Saffron-hill - I have been there several times, but cannot find him - his father lives there.
GEORGE - . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found three more handkerchiefs in his pocket: they have not been claimed.
Prisoner's Defence. One handkerchief he took off my neck, and gave me one instead.
GEORGE - . I lent him another.

 for stealing, on the

GEORGE PEWTRESS
. I am journeyman to Mr. Cooper, a butcher, of Bridge-row, Lambeth. On the 12th of June I was in Beech-street, in the City, about half-past one o'clock, and saw two gentlemen walking along Beech-street very fast—one of them had his handkerchief hanging out of his pocket—I saw the prisoner walk up to him, take it out, and put it into his hat—I kept my eye on him, and told the officer of it—I told him the handkerchief was in his hat—he looked into it, and there it was—I never lost sight of the prisoner, and am not mistaken in him.





MATTHEW PEEK
 (police-constable G 198.) On the 12th of June,

in consequence of information from Pewtress, I apprehended the prisoner in Chiswell-street, which joins Beech-street, and is in a line with it—I was searching his pocket, when Pewtress told me he had got it in his hat—I took off his hat, and found the handkerchief there—I produce it—I do not know the name of the person who lost it.
(The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had exchanged the handkerchief found on him with a man for three ladies' work-boxes, which he was in the habit of making, and that the witness lost sight of him for some time, and he had opportunity to escape.)




GUILTY
. *Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a watchman. I met the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 4th of May, about ten o'clock, at the top of East-street, Hoxton, about two hundred yards from Mr. Salter's with a bundle - I asked what was in it, he said some washing; I took it from under his arm, and seeing some hair and the rest of these articles in it, I took him to the watch-house.
JOHN SALTER. I am a horse-hair manufacturer
, and live at Hoxton


. On Sunday, the 4th of May, I went out at four o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my door on the single lock; I came home about eleven o'clock at night - I had drunk rather more than had done me good; the door was locked - I went in and went up to bed - my wife perceived the things disturbed; we had left nobody at home; we looked and missed these articles from the first-floor front room.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been drinking before you left home? A. I had taken a little - I know I pulled the door too.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I searched him and found some picklock keys, a crow-bar, and phosphorus box on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking - I heard a cry, ran out to see what it was, and these things lay in the road - I took them up.

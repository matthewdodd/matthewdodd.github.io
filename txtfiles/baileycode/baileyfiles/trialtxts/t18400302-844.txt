JOHN HORTON
 (City police-constable, No. 103.) On the night of the 28th of February I was on duty in King William-street, near Scarlett's ham-and-beef-shop—I saw the prisoner following a cart in the street—he took a cask out of the cart, as it turned round towards the Bank—the prisoner turned towards Gracechurch-street, and a person told the carman he had lost a cask—he jumped out of the cart, and he and I followed the prisoner—he had got the cask on his shoulder, and I took him with it.


Prisoner. Q. Why did you not come and take me when I took it? A. I did not know you had stolen it then—I thought you might have had permission to put it into the cart to carry over the bridge, as is often the case.





NICHOLAS HENRY MEARS
. I am carman to Mr. George Perry and Francis Gill, they are wholesale cheesemongers, and live on Dowgate-hill. On the 28th of February, when I came to the rise of King William-street, I heard of a cask of butter being stolen—I jumped out and ran with the officer—I took the prisoner with it on his shoulder—it was my master's.

Prisoner. A man asked me to carry it to Bishopsgate-street, and said he would give me a shilling.





JAMES TUGWELL
 (City police-constable, No. 144.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—I was present at his trial twelve months ago—I know he is the person—(read.)

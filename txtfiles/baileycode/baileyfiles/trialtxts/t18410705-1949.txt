1949. 




CHARLES ALLEN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of June, 1 truck, value 2l., the goods of 



Isaac Mills; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






LOUISA MILLS
. I live with my father, Isaac Mills, in York-street,

Newington; he has trucks to let out. On the 12th of June the prisoner came to hire one for an hour—I let him have one—I have never seen it since—I am sure he is the man—I had not known him before.

Prisoner. You told me you did not let trucks to strangers, and refused to let me have it unless I left money on it, which I had not got. Witness. We always have 1s. left, but he had not got it, and I let him have it.

Prisoner's Defence. I had no money, and walked away without the truck; she said she did not lend them out to strangers without leaving 1s. on it; and I did not have it.





JAMES MASON
 (police-constable P 276.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

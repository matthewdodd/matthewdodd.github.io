REV. VERE ISHAM. I reside in Northamptonshire. On the 26th of June I was at the Review, in Hyde-park


, and had a watch and seals - I did not feel them taken, but a person gave me information; I felt, and it was gone - the prisoner was pointed out about a yard from me.

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty in the park, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner with his arm up at the prosecutor's breast; I went up, and saw him draw this watch out - I took hold of his collar with one hand, and took the watch from him with the other; my brother officer went and told the prosecutor - I asked the prisoner at the office if any body was in company with him; he said No, and that distress drove him to it; I think he was alone - he took the watch quite in style.(Property produced and sworn to.)

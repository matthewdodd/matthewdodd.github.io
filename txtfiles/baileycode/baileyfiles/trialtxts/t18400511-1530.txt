JOHN THOROGOOD
. I am policeman. On the 16th of April, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners going down Church-street, Deptford—Spicer was carrying something which appeared heavy—I asked him what he had—he said, "Some lead"—I asked where he got it from—he said he had it from a man at Lewisham-bridge, but he did not know the man, nor where he lived—I took him to the station-house—I saw Griggs following him down Church-street, from the direction of Mill-lane, but not walking with him.





WILLIAM THOMAS ARTHUR
. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 16th of April, at a quarter past eight o'clock, I was on duty in Church-street—I saw Thorogood stop Spicer—he took him to the station-house—Griggs was following him; and when he saw him taken, be ran away—I took him on Saturday morning—I found nothing on him.





WILLIAM CROWLEY
. I am a policeman. I compared the lead found on the prisoner with the inside of the door on the prosecutor's premises, and the nail-holes of the lead correspond exactly—it was in a shed detached from the dwelling-house.

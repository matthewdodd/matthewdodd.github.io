                  , from his person
            .
JOHN HURLEY. I am a boot and shoe maker
, and live at Broadwall, Lambeth; the prisoner was a stranger - I met her in Fleet-street


, at half-past eleven o'clock at night - she asked me to go home with her - I refused - she was rather in liquor - she took me by the arm and turned me round into an alley; I still said I would not go with her; she twisted me round and took 10 s. 6 d. out of my right hand waistcoat pocket - I had 11 s. 6 d. - there was a crown piece among it; I caught her hand in my pocket, and told her to give up the money - she would not; I called a watchman, and put her hand into his - he took her to the watch-house, opened her hand, and found a crown piece, five shillings and a sixpence.

            . I am a watchman. Hurley called me - I went up and found the prisoner there - he charged her with robbing him of 10 s. 6 d. - he was sober and she rather in liquor; I found a crown, five shillings and a sixpence in her hand - she had denied having any money.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - Grigg's account is correct.

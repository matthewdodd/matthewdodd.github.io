SARAH GILBERT
. I am the wife of Richard Gilbert, and live in the Lewisham-road, in the parish of Deptford. The prisoner was in my service—she left us on the morning of the 5th of April, and I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are here,—they are ours—the was tent by the parish to nurse me.

Prisoner. You lent me the things, or I never should have taken them—you wanted me to come—I was very ill, and I had not time to bring my own clothes—you said you would lend me the things. Witness. On my oath, it is not true.

Prisoner. It was a roguish business of mine, certainly; but I have been used to good service, and had not she been a rogue of a mistreat I never should have run away.





JOHN DYKE
. I am a policeman. I was on duty on this morning, and saw the prisoner, about ten or eleven o'clock, in Trafalgar-row, Greenwich, with this parcel in her hand—I took it from her—it was part of the property stolen.

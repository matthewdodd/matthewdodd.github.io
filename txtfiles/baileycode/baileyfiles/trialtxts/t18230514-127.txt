            . I am a linendraper. Last WednesdayI saw the prisoners in the Commercial-road, loitering about backward and forward for near an hour, and then saw Johnson remove the carpet and Jackson take it away. I pursued, and he dropped it in King-street; I secured him, and am certain of them both.

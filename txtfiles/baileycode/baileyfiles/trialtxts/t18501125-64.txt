JOHN NAYLOR



, stealing 1 tame rabbit, value 2s.; the property of 



John Balcomb: Barnes having been before convicted.






WILLIAM HAYCOCK
. I am a stone-sawyer, and live in the Commercial-road. On 30th Oct., at seven o'clock in the morning, as I was at work, I saw Naylor standing outside a hoarding in Desborough-place—I heard some kind of talk taking place—I could not tell whether it was Naylor or some one inside the hoarding—I looked over the hoarding, and saw Barnes with another man not in custody—one was in the enclosed ground belonging to a house—I saw one of them, I do not know which, hand a rabbit over to the other—Naylor went away, and I took Barnes as he was getting over the fence, a policeman came, and I gave him into custody.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was not Naylor thirty yards from the fence? A. No.





WILLIAM BLAIR
 (policeman, B 129). I took Barnes into custody from Haycock—he pointed out the premises—I looked over the hoarding and saw a rabbit, which I took—I took Naylor at seven o'clock at night—he said he was not the man at the stealing of the rabbit.





MART BALCOMB
. I am the wife of John Balcomb. I have seen the rabbit that was taken that morning; it is my husband's, and used to be kept in a hutch in the yard, at the back of our house, 23, Desborough-place—in consequence of information on this morning, I looked out of my bed-room window, and saw the rabbit in an enclosed space of ground adjoining the house—it was sitting very quiet, and I thought it was dead—it was in the hutch at nine o'clock the night before.





EDWARD WILLIAMS
 (policeman, B 45). I produce a certificate of Barnes' conviction at this Court—( read—Convicted May, 1849, having been before convicted—confined twelve months)—I was present—he is the person.

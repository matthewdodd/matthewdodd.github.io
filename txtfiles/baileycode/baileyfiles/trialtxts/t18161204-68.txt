            . I saw the prisoner take the shawl from Mr. Brook's door, and run off with it; he had another man with him; he ran towards me; I saw him with the shawl in his hand; he got from me; his companion knocked me down; I pursued him, and took him again; I am sure he is the man; I gave him in charge to the watchman; he had made away with the shawl before I took him the second time.

 for a misdemeanor.


MR. PAYNE
conducted the Prosecution






JOHN JAMES TYLER
. I am in the employment of Mr. Warraker, a law stationer. We supplied Mr. Warre with paper and stamps—in May and June the prisoner came to Mr. Warraker's for stamps and paper, which I served him with frequently—I remember his coming on Monday the 15th of August—I think his words were, "We want a ream of lined brief paper," or "I want"—while I was serving him he said that Mr. Warre complained of the paper they last had, as being full of hairs—I offered to send it to Mr. Warre's, he said, he would take it himself—it was worth about 1l. 5s—in a day or two he came and asked for a ream of draft paper—just as he was going out he said, "Put it down to Mr. Warre"—I should not have let him have it, but for knowing he was in Mr. Warre's service and from what he said—he came about a week afterwards, and asked for a ream of cut foolscap—while I was serving him one of Mr. Warre's clerks came into the office, and the prisoner slipped behind him, and went out without the paper.





GEORGE WARRE
. I am a solicitor, and live in Great James-street. The prisoner has been in my employ several years, with an interval of a few months—he finally quitted about the 20th of July—after that time, I gave him no authority to go to my stationer's for paper—I have not seen him since the 20th of July—I was not aware of it till after the last of the three occasions, when Tyler and my clerk came and told me of it—I ordered no paper on the 15th of August, nor after that.





GEORGE THORNTON
 (police-constable G 91.) I took the prisoner. and told him he had been obtaining paper in Mr. Warre's name—he told me he had pawned it for 13s.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            's house, No. 4, Green's-court, in St. James's parish


. I and Logan, occupied one room in 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Smith
               



            's house; it was a furnished room. Mr. Smith, did not live in the house. Upon a Saturday evening, in January, I believe the 7th, I missed the bed that I lay on, and the bedding, blankets, sheets, coverlid, rug, bolster, and a pillow, were all gone when I came home, about nine o'clock.
Q. Do you recollect when you last saw them safe in your room - A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can say. I left my room at seven o'clock, and did not return till-nine; I left nobody in the room; when I went out I locked the door. When I went out, Logan was not at home; each of us had a key of the room. I came home about nine o'clock; I found the room door wide open; there was no marks of violence on the door; it had been opened by a key, or a picklock. The first time that I saw the things was here, in this court, in April last.
Q. Did you know Brown, Amos, or Mackey - A. No further than seeing them here. I know nothing of the prisoner, or the business, than what I am told.

            . Q. Do you and the last witness, Royle, rent a room of Smith - A. Yes; I had been there about two months before that; Royle about a fortnight; it was a ready furnished room, we rented it of 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Smith
               



            .
Q. Do you recollect the time when the bed and bedding were missed, when you were not at home - A. Yes, I was at home a little before seven; I put on my things and came away; I am sure I locked the door when I left the room. I came home about nine, and then I found the bed and bedding gone. I know nothing of the prisoner, nor did I see the things until they were brought here last April.

            , Brown, and

            , alias Merritt, and I, went to Mr. Smith's house, No. 4, in Green's-court. Brown with two picklock-keys opened the parlour-door, me and Brown went in the room; Merritt stood in the passage. We went in, and brought out the bed; we brought out the bed on the left hand in the room, sheets, blankets, two quilts, a bolster, and a pillow. The street door was shut, and latched; we lifted up the latch. The parlour-door was locked; we opened that with a picklock-key; we brought out the bed and bedding, and took them to Mr. Saunders's, in Dudley-court, Crown-street; he declined buying them. He told us to go to Whitfield, he would buy them.
Q. What was he - A. A farrier. I and Brown went to Whitfield, the prisoner; I and Brown had the bed, sheets, blankets, quilts bolster, and pillow. We found Whitfield up stairs in the first floor, he lodged there. Brown and me knew him before Brown went up and told him what we had; I staid down stairs. Brown and Whitfield came down stairs to me; we asked him whether he would buy the bed and bedding; he said, bring it to the shop, and he would look at them in the work-shop; we took them in his work-shop up the yard. We shewed him the bed, sheets, blankets, and quilts; he looked at them all. He told us to go to the King's Head public-house, and he would come to us. He asked us to tell him what part of the town it came from; I told him it came from St. James's, about Peter-street. He said, if he knew what part of the town it came from he should know how to dispose of it; then he told us to go to the King's Head public-house; I and Brown went, and left the bed and bedding there. He came to us in five minutes; he asked us what we asked for it; we told him two pound. He said, he would give us twenty-three shillings, that was all he would give; we agreed to take it. He gave me and 
               Brown
             a one-pound note, and a three-shilling piece; then we parted, nothing more passed.
Q. Did you see Whitfield afterwards - A. No, not till now, except at Queen-square office. I am sure he is the man.

                  PACE
               



            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of November, at a public-house in Tottenham-court-road, and last February I found the property in his room.
Q. How did you know it was the prisoner's room - A. From Cotton's confession, after procuring a search warrant.
Q. What did you find there - A. I found a bed. I took him with me, and a woman of the name of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Clark
               



            ; she identified the property. I found a bed, one sheet, two blankets, and two patch-work quilts. This is one of them; I found them under the bed in Whitfield's room; Whitfield's wife was in the room when I was there.
Q. Was there any yard to that house - A. Yes, and a farrier's shop; we searched that at the time.
Q. Do you know the number of the house - A. No. I have got the landlord of the house here. This is one of the coverlids I found; I have had it in my possession ever since. The other things I produced in April sessions; they were returned to the owner. On the prisoner's person I found these picklock-keys.

            . I am the landlord of the house in Crown-street, Soho. The prisoner rented of me a one pair of stairs front room; the housebelongs to me, but not the shop; there was a shop behind it, it has no concern with my house. There was a smith's at the back of the house. The prisoner lodged in the house last January; his wife lived with him. I never saw him in the house after the bed was taken away; his wife continued there. I did not see the things taken away. The officer brought me a subpoena last Monday to attend here, at the house where the prisoner lodged.
Pace. I served the subpoena on the landlord personally in the samehouse;

            . I live in Green's-court, St. James's. When the property was found in Whitfield's room, I was with the officer. I am Mrs. Smith's sister, the wife of Mr. Smith, who owns the house.
Q. Do you know this house in Green's court - A. Yes, and I am acquainted with the furniture. I made the beds every day.
Q. Is that the coverlid of the bed now produced - A. Yes, I have no doubt of it. The value of the bed and bedding was about three pounds altogether.
Prisoner's Defence. At Queen-square Mr. Smith could not speak to the bed; he said he would send his sister.


                  Mary 
                  Clark
               



            . I know the bed and bedding to be the property of Mr. Smith's; all the furniture in that house was his property. I made the beds every day. I know the bed and bedding to be his property.

            . I live in the Haymarket. On the 30th of September between one and two o'clock in the day I was in King-street, Bloomsbury


, walking with a lady, and felt some person touch me - I turned round and felt that my handkerchief was gone. I saw the prisoner crossing the street close at my side; I followed him - he crossed the street again into Holborn - I then took hold of him - he denied having the handkerchief; but I found it in his breast.

            . I was standing at my shop in Holborn, and saw the prisoner. Mr. Gillet was running after him - I took the handkerchief from the prisoner's breast, and have kept it ever since.

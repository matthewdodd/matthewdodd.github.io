CATHERINE WICKHART
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of October, 2 yards of floor-cloth, value 2s., the goods of 



Thomas Holmes, and that she had been before convicted of felony.


James Minns (police-constable G 4.) I apprehended the prisoner near the prosecutor's door, in Gray's Inn-lane—the prosecutor's daughter had taken the property from her then.





CAROLINE HOLMES
. I am the daughter of Thomas Holmes—he keeps a broker's shop I was standing at the door while my father was gone with a bedstead—he came home, and told me this woman had got a piece of floor-cloth, and I went and took it from her—this is it.





THOMAS HOLMES
. On the 17th I was gone to Brook-street, Holborn, with a bedstead, and while I was looking round for the number, I saw the prisoner with my piece of floor-cloth folded up in her arms—I pitched the

bedstead down, and ran home to find the truth of it—I told my daughter the prisoner had taken it.

Prisoner. Q. Did I not deliver the floor-cloth into your hands to sell it? A. No, you did not.

Prisoner. It was intrusted to my care, and I went to the shop to offer it for sale—I was in a public-house, and a woman came in with it in her hand—it was lost two hours before I had it.





JOHN GRAY
 (police-constable C 164) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            : I live over-against the New Church in the Strand. On the 11th of August between three and four in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came to my Shop, and asked if the Gentlewoman was within; my Man said yes, and brought him to the Parlour where I keep the Lace. - He said he had an Order out of the Country, for seven Yards of Mecklin Lace; I asked him what Price he would go to, he said about 12 s. a Yard. I asked him, what Breadth he would have it, and he said about an Inch; then I took out a Box of Lace, and shewed him two Pieces, one of 14 s. per Yard, and the other Half a Guinea. He gave them to me again and said nothing, I took out another Box, and he put his Hand upon one of 13 s. and then he clapped his Hand upon another, and said, I suppose that is dearer. I told him it was 20 s. per Yard; he bid me Half a Guinea, for what I told him was 13 s. and took up his Hat and Cane, and said, you bad better take my Money, I will give you 11 s. which I could not take, and he went away. I missed the Piece of Lace directly, but I did not know at first but I might have put it into another Box; it happened to be stopped by Mr Paine the Pawnbroker, who was so kind as to bring it to me, and has kept it in his Custody ever since. He did not come as a Dealer in Lace, but as a Sort of a Gentleman. - This is the Piece of Lace that I missed at that Time.
Maltus Paine. On the 11th of August, about three or four in the Afternoon, the Prisoner brought me a Piece of Lace to pledge; I have had some little Dealings with him before, and he has told me he was a Lace Merchant; the Night before this, I happened to have some small Information from a Gentleman who has another Indictment against the Prisoner, that he had lost a Piece of Lace which I had taken in, and that gave me some Suspicion of the Prisoner; that was the Thing that brought this to light, or else I had taken this Piece in from him; for I took him to be a Man of Reputation and Character; he asked me five Guineas upon it; I asked him whose Property it was, he said, it was his own; I said, it is very possible it may be your own; but I am informed that I have a Piece in my Custody that you brought me that is not your own, and I will know whose this is; so I stopped him, and had him before a Justice - he did not make any Confession, he said, he received it from a Perriwig maker that was making Wiggs for him - I believe I should not have lent him five Guineas upon it - he said it was his own, and that he dealt in Lace - he did not seem surprized, he was not under any Confusion - I have made it my Business to enquire after him, and People give him but a very indifferent Character - this is the same Piece I had of the Prisoner.

            . Aug. 11. I went to Mr Paine's Shop the Prisoner was in the Shop, and Mr Paine had this Piece of Lace in his Hand; Mr Paine asked him what he would have upon it; he told him; Mr Paine asked him how he came by it; the Prisoner said, Why do you ask me that Question? I deal in it. Mr Paine said, he must know how he came by it; so Mr Paine charged me with him, and as we were going along, I stopped at my own Door about a Letter, and the Prisoner was gone in a Minute, he run away, and got into Great Russel Street, I cried out stop Thief, and took him again; Now, says Mr Paine, you have spoiled all your Innocency, for you would not have run away if you had been innocent; I asked him where he lived, he said, he had a Lodging in Maiden-Lane Covent-Garden; and he said before the Justice that his Name was

            . I have a first Floor in Mr Pearce's House, and deal in Lace; the Prisoner came on the 29th of June, about ten in the Morning, and said he wanted seven Yards of Mecklin Lace, of about 10 s. per Yard; I shewed him one, he said, he would give me Nine; I told him I would take no less than Ten; and that as he seemed not to understand the Value of it, if he paid me the Money, and did not like it afterwards, I would give him the Money again; I opened another Box, and he put his Hand in and took out a Piece; I took the Piece out of his Hand, and said they were above his Price; then he clapped his other Hand, with his Handkerchief in it, upon the Corner of the Box, and I imagine he took the Piece of Lace that way, (I had put the Piece up again that I shewed him) and as he went out he offered me 9 s. 6 d. About an Hour and an half afterwards I missed the Piece of Lace that he stole out of the Box that he put his Hand into; and about three or four Days afterwards I missed five Pieces more, two of six Yards three Quarters, two of six Yards, and two that were but Remnants; then was I dubious, whether some of my Servants had not stole them: I went to Mr Paine's, and told him, I had lost several Pieces of Lace, and he was very ingenuous in shewing me what Laces he had; this is the Piece I had of Mr Paine, the other Piece that I lost then I never had - I am very positive this is my Lace, and that I missed this Piece of Lace the 29th of June: I believe the Lace went all at the same Time, for I never saw the Prisoner since - This is not the Piece that I missed at first - I did not shew this particular Piece of Lace to him - I opened two Boxes of Lace, and this was in one of the Boxes - I missed one Piece out of one Box, and five out of the other - the Night before he came I told my Laces over - I did not tell them over again till three or four Days after he was there.
Maltus Paine. Mrs Mason was at my House, and was telling my Wife of her Misfortune, in losing several Pieces of Lace. I said, I have taken in two Pieces, may be one or both may be your's. I shewed the Lace to her, and she was very positive to this Piece; this Piece I had of the Prisoner. The next Day afterwards he came with another Piece of about thirteen Yards, and then I stopped him and the Lace too. When he brought this Piece of four Yards and an Half, I asked him several Questions, and he gave me such satisfactory Answers, that really I had no Suspicion of him. I lent him a Guinea upon it.

            , the Constable, gave much the same Evidence as in the former Trial, adding, that when Mr Paine charged him with the Prisoner, he said, Why do you stop me, I can bring a great many Persons to my Character, and said he would leave his Goods, and fetch somebody to his Character, but Mr Paine would not let him go, and as I was carrying the Prisoner along, he ran away from me.
Q Did he run bravely?
Hull. He ran most stoutly, and said there were Business running after him, but I took him and carried him before Justice Moore, and then he said his Name was

            's Shop in Catherine-street in the Strand, looked about him, and said, he believed he was right, that he came from two Ladies at Richmond, and asked, if some Time ago I had not sold some Lace to two Ladies that live there, I told him yes; he said, he came from those Ladies; and that they desired Mrs Gubbins to send them seven Yards of Lace, at 10 s. a Yard; my Mistress took out two Boxes of Lace, and shewed him some; he was a great while looking at them, found fault, and said, one was too dear, and made one Excuse or another, at last he hid her 12 s. a Yard for one, that she asked him 16 s. for; she agreed to let him have it at 12 s. He said he had an Acquaintance hard by, that he would go and fetch them to have their Opinion upon it, and would be back again in Half a Quarter of an Hour. He went out of the Shop, and I did not see him any more. Upon putting the Laces into the Box again, I missed two Yards of broad Mecklin Lace, four Yards and a half of another, and seven Yards of English Lace. Some Time after that hearing somebody was taken up for stealing Lace from Mrs. Mason, I went to Col.

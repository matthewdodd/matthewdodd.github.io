                  , from his person
            .
THOMAS ASHTON. I was in Holborn


 last Friday night, about eight o'clock; the prisoner caught hold of me, and asked where I was going - I said home; she put her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took out my money, which I had seen a quarter of an hour before - I caught hold of her and gave her to the watchman. I was quite sober.

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Watch! and I went out of my box - a gentleman, who was going away, said he saw the prisoner put her hand into the prosecutor's pocket - I took her to the watch-house, and found on her thirteen shillings, six sixpences, and half-a-crown - she said she had 1l. 11s. 6d., which her husband gave her.
Prisoner's Defence. I had the money in my pocket - it was my own - the watch-house-keeper's wife told the prosecutor not to come in in such an indecent condition.

            . No; there is not a word of truth in it - the prisoner was rather drunk but knew what she was about.
JURY to THOMAS ASHTON. Q. Do you always carry your money in your waistcoat pocket? A. I had a hole in my trousers pocket - I had a sixpence more in my pocket- she took it all at one time.

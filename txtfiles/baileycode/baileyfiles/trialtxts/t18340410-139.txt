 - I had just used my handkerchief, and put it in my outside coat pocket - I almost instantly felt a twitch - I turned round and saw the prisoner, and said, "You have my pocket handkerchief" - he instantly ran across the road - a gentleman caught him, and said, "What has he done?" - the gentleman put his hand to his side pocket, and drew it out - I gave him in charge - I had the handkerchief, but it is worn out now - I am certain it was mine.

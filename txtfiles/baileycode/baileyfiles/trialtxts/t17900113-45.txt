I am a constable, on the 29th of December last, I took the prisoner with the lead on his shoulders; he was in the street where the stables are, at the bottom of the street, coming from the stables between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I took him and the lead; I had no conversation with him then; I took him before the justice that evening: the justice desired me to secure him in some place till I could make enquiry of it: Thomlinson and Kiddle the plumber came and owned the lead.

On the 24th of December, or within a day or two of it, I put on some lead on the gutter of the prosecutor's stables, for Mr. Holmes the plumber; and I was sent for to the public office; I saw and knew the lead at first sight; I tried to fit it with the place; it fitted, and appeared to be the same, it was cut and torn in many places.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A man came out of the stables with the lead as I came past, and asked me to carry it for a pot of beer.

JOHN ELLWOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of December, 1 handkerchief, value 3s.; the goods of 



Edward Toplis, from his person.






EDWARD TOPLIS
. On Sunday afternoon, the 21st of December, about five minutes after three o'clock, I was going to church—just by Shoreditch church gate I missed my handkerchief out of my pocket—I did not feel it taken—I made a stand for a moment, and a witness called out, "I have got him," and in a minute the prisoner was brought up to me with it in his possession.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





GEORGE ROBERT MILLER
. I was standing at my master's door, and saw two boys, less than the prisoner, at the prosecutor's pocket—the smallest boy called to the prisoner, and said, "Come on"—I watched them for fifty yards—I saw the prisoner draw the prosecutor's handkerchief out, and put it into his breast-pocket—I collared him, and called to the prosecutor.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . As I was going home to Cow-cross I saw the prisoner run across the way; as he had something upon him, I suspected him, I watched him, and saw him rest it upon a pump; I asked him what he had got, he threatened to knock me down: I collared him, upon which he threw down his lead, and attempted to get away; but I hindered him; I called the constable, and gave him charge of the prisoner; then he said he bought it at Cow-cross for half a gallon of beer.

            . I work for Mr. Rutt. I happened to be going by at this time, and suspecting the lead to be Mr. Rutt's, I sent my brother to examine Mr. Rutt's buildings.

            . I am brother to the last witness; I took the lead by my brother's desire to the house of Mr. Rutt; it exactly fitted the place from whence some lead had been stolen.

             the constable confirmed the evidence of

            . I am sure from many circumstances this is my lead.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

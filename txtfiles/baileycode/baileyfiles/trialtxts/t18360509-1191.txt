HENRY PATTESON SMITH
. I am shopman to Thomas Hall of Bishopsgate-street. I was in the shop on the 5th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came in for a skein of silk, and while I turned my back to get it out of the drawer he took thirteen handkerchiefs with his own handkerchief under his arm—I saw them through the corner of his handkerchief—he drawn them close to the edge of the counter, but they were not off the counter—I took hold of his collar—his arm was on the handkerchief on the counter—they were off the pile, and his handkerchief was rolled round them, but the corners were not tied—they were ready to put under his arm—they might have fallen from the pile by accident, but could not have got rolled up.

JURY. Q. Hoe long were you gone to get the silk? A. Not more than a minute—the bundle of handkerchiefs stood close by his side—he had time to get his handkerchief over them—there was a boy waiting outside who ran off as soon as I got the door.





WILLIAM BOSTON
, I am a ward-constable—I took the prisoner and the handkerchiefs.

Prisoner. I laid my handkerchief over them—they were not rolled up.

Transported for Seven Years.

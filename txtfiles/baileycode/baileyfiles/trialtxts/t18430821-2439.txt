JOHN NABBS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of August, 100 cigars, value 14s., the goods of 



Charles Butler and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES BUTLER
. I am in partnership with Charles Lambert. On the 7th of August I was at breakfast in my parlour—I heard a noise, and came down—I found these cigars had been removed from the case, and put on the counter—the prisoner was then in custody.





JOSEPH BROMLEY
. I was sitting in my shop, next door to the prosecutor's,

about half-past eight o'clock, reading a book—I saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards—I then missed him—I went to the prosecutor's door—I saw him go in, push by a board, shove the lid off the chest of cigars, and take these out—I stepped up and asked what he was going to do—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "What do you want here?"—he said, "I don't want anything"—I said again, "What do you want?"—he said, "I don't know"—I shut the door, and called my man to get the police.

Prisoner. on took them out of the chest yourself, and laid them on the counter, then said that I did it.





EDWIN ROBINS
 (police-constable F 66.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . About the beginning of this month, I saw the prisoner take a pair of breeches from the prosecutor's door, as they were hanging up; I was at work and could not pursue him; about ten days after he came by again. I went out and took him, and asked him if he did not remember his taking a pair of breeches, and carried him to the house; he owned he took them, and pawn'd them for 3 s. and where.
Prisoner. I found them in the street.
Holding. I saw him take them down from the place where they hung.

            . These are my breeches, I described them before I saw them, and told her there was the letter E in the waistband, which is to be seen now.

HARRIET COLLINS
. I am the wife of John Beadle Collins, of Kingsland-road. On the 27th of April, about twelve o'clock, I sent my little girl, Harriet, out for some porter—she is six years old—she did not come back when I expected—I went out, and saw Lynch touch her necklace—Brown and another person were with him—as soon as Lynch saw me coming he snatched the necklace from the child's neck, and it fell to the ground—he picked it up, and they all three ran away together—I am sure the two prisoners were there, and Lynch took the necklace.

LYNCH—


GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Ten Years.


BROWN—


GUILTY
. Aged 16.—



Confined Three Months.

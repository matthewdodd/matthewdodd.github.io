ELIZABETH HINDLEY
. I am the wife of Joseph Hindley, of No. 7, Dorset-place, Market-square. I let lodgings—the prisoner inquired for a lodging on the 4th of August—I let him half a bed—there was another person in the bed with him—he went to bed about ten, and got up about half-past six o'clock, and went out with a bundle—he returned to break fast, and then left about half-past nine o'clock—I missed these things about twelve o'clock from the room where he had been—he was taken on Monday—part of the property was on him—this snuff-box is mine, and this pencil-case, and this shirt was in a drawer—the pencil-case and snuff box were in a box.





CHARLES HENRY CURRY
 (police-constable D 140.) On the 7th of August I took this prisoner, in consequence of another charge, and found these, things on him.

ROBERT GORDON CANE
. I am a policeman. On the 29th of November, I was in Gibson-square, Islington, and met the prisoner—there was a little boy about ten yards before him—the prisoner was carrying this bag—I asked what he had got—he said, what was that to me—I said, "I. wish to know"—he said, "Some grub"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "Where my mother works"—I took him and found 11lbs. of beef, and the other things stated—I found the owner living at No. 55, Gibson-square.

Prisoner. Q. Did I say anything more? A. You wanted me to put the bag down and look at it there, and I would not.





ISAAC CLEMENTSON SANDERSON
. I live at No. 55, Gibson-square, and am a clerk in a solicitor's office. I missed these articles from a safe in my front area, about seven o'clock in the morning, and about eleven o'clock I heard that the prisoner had been taken with it in his possession—I know it is mine—these plates are mine—mine is rather a deep area, and not covered—there are no steps to go down—he must have dropped down.


Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through Gibson-square, and saw two men leave an area—I walked over and saw a bag—I looked at the men—they went away, and then I took the bag—I went on and met the police, man, who wanted to see what I had got—I told him to come to the station-house and see.

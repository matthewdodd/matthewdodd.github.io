JANE EDWARDS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
30th of September, 1 pocket-book, value 1s., the goods of 



Michael Malin Biggs, from his person.






JAMES LONGFOOT
. I am a printer. On the night of the 30th of September, between one and two o'clock, I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner walking behind the prosecutor, with her hand in his pocket; I turned round, and she was in the act of pulling the pocket-book out of his pocket; when I got behind her, she finished pulling it out, and threw it on the ground—I picked it up, laid hold of her, and informed Mr. Biggs, and gave her into custody—there was one woman on each side of the prosecutor, and the prisoner was behind.





MICHAEL MALIN BIGGS
. I was walking in Holbora—Longfoot informed me about my pocket-book—this is it—my name is in it—it was in my pocket before I went to the station-house with the prisoner—there was a lot of women there—I was not quite sober—I had been out to supper.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Holborn, and saw the prosecutor very much intoxicated, walking arm-in-arm with two females; all of a sudden the women ran away, and dropped something. I stood still on hearing the alarm, and was given in charge. I know nothing of it; what the witness has sworn is quite false.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

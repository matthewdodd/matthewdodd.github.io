            . I am a student of Wadham college, Oxford
. On the 27th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on Holborn-hill


, by Field-lane - I felt something at my coat pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the hands of a gentleman, who hadstopped him, and charged with having my handkerchief; I drew his hand out of his pocket, with my handkerchief in it.
WILLIAM BATES. I am shopman on Holborn-bridge. I was standing at my employer's door, and saw the prisoner in company with another young man; the prosecutor was about two yards before them - I saw the prisoner's companion go up to the prosecutor, and saw both his hands upon his pocket; he drew the handkerchief out, and gave it to the prisoner, who concealed it under his coat; I immediately ran across the road, secured the prisoner, and told Mr. Heale; he asked the prisoner for his handkerchief, and he delivered it up to him; his companion ran down Field-lane.
WILLIAM BONUS. I received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A young man, who I did not know, dropped the handkerchief - I took it up, and put it into my pocket.

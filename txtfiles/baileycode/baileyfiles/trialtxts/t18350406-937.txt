JANE DOWNES
. I am the prisoner's mother. I live on BethnalGreen. On the 10th of February, I left the prisoner and my other, son to mind my child—I returned within an hour, and my other little boy said something—the prisoner was then gone—I missed the two coats, and the other articles—I did not see the prisoner again till the Saturday, when he was brought back for stealing a blanket—he said he had sold these things in Rosemary-lane, to a man who lived near St. Paul's.





PATRICK LARKING
 (police-constable H 125.) I took the prisoner—I heard him say, he had sold the things in Rosemary-lane, to a man who lived near St. Paul's—I tried to trace them, but could not.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—

            , his relation and apprentice, deposed  he saw the prisoner often walking backwards and forwards by the door, he concealed himself and watched and saw her go into the parlour and come out with the coat and waistcoat, and as she was going off with them, she finding she was discovered, throw them down in the entry and ran, he followed and stopt her in the street.

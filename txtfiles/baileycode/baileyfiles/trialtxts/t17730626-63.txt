            . I live in Margaret-street, Westminster. On the 6th of May I went into St. Dunstan's church


, between six and seven o'clock, and stood in the south isle by the prisoner; when I had been there some time, I felt a hand at my pocket; I had no suspicion at that time; in about a quarter of an hour I put my hand in my pocket and missed my handkerchief; I said to a gentleman that stood by, Sir, I have lost my handkerchief, take care of your pockets; he said he believed the man that stood by me had it; the prisoner went out; I followed him, and asked him if he had it; he said no, and pulled out two, but they were not mine, so I let him go; I was afterwards persuaded by some people that stood by to follow him; I did, and the people with me; they undid his breeches and found my handkerchief upon him. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I was coming out of St. Dunstan's church the 6th of May, and saw the prosecutor talking to the prisoner about his handkerchief; I followed the prisoner with him, after he had let him go. The handkerchief was found in the flap of his breeches.

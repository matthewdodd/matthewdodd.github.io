Court. Where did the first fire begin. - A. In a closet in the laundry, and the second fire was in a closet in the parlour.

Court. Now Mr. Maud, before you proceed I wish you would tell me what you mean by her confessing to you, what did she say. - A. She told me that she had been insuring in the lottery, that she had borrowed five pound of the cook; from that conversation I asked her where the person lived that she insured with and what was his name.
Q. Now go on to state what she said relative to that paper in your hand. - A. I asked her what be came of the plate that was missing; she fell on her knees and said that she was the most wicked wretch alive. I then asked her what she had done with the plate, she said where it was.

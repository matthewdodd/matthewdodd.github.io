JAMES WILLIAM BALL
. I also missed the articles stated in this indictment. I have not been able to trace them at present.

Prisoner. You had no such things when I went into the house.





CATHERINE BALL
. I have been to several pawnbrokers, and cannot find these things—I had such articles, and missed them when I came home—before I went my husband gave me 3l., and I took a bill of 30s.—I bought some things, and took out some things—it was all through the prisoner's persuasion I went to the hospital.

Prisoner. She sent round to my lodging to say she had met with an accident, and she was tipsy. Witness. No, I went down stairs to get a little gruel for my husband, at he was ill—I fell down and met with my accident—I had been to take a gown home at eight o'clock, and I was home by ten.





DANIEL COCOERILL
 (City police-constable, No. 314.) The prisoner was given into my charge—Mr. Ball was talking about the articles, and the prisoner said she had pledged the counterpane, and that was the only thing she had pledged on her own account—she did not mention whose property it was—I have not been able to find it—she said Mr. Ball authorised her to take the other things.

                  Campbell
               



            ; we lived at 17, Cumberland-street


, in January last, in the parish of St. Pancras, in the house of 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Jerome
               



            ; we were lodgers in the house; I lodged there on the 15th of January, and for some time previous. Ann Harding is my own sister; she came to me on the 10th of January, to stay until I could get her a situation; she came from the Refuge on the 10th, and staid with me till Monday, the 15th. I went out in the morning, at eight o'clock, and came home to dinner at one. When I went out in the morning. I sent my sister down to her cousin, and when I came home to dinner, she said, her cousin was not at home. After dinner, I took her out with me to a situation, which I was procuring for her, and had her engaged, and then sent her home to my house, and told her that I should not return before ten o'clock; I had to go to her mistress to settle about her wages. When I returned home at night, I rang at the bell three times, and could not get in until the landlady got up, and let me in: my sister used to sit up for me always; but I found she was gone from the house, and the property was gone too; my wearing apparel; one trunk was taken away, and the things were taken out of the other. When I went out, I left two trunks with wearing apparel in them; I had left them both locked. I found one gone, and the other opened, and empty. I never saw my sister from the Monday until the Saturday morning following, when between twelve and one she was brought to me. I never saw 
               
                  Ann 
                  Brewer
               



             until she was taken. When I sent my sister back, I gave her the key of the house to let herself in, and the key of my room also, and when I returned again, I found the key of my room door in the door.

            . I did live at No. 6. Tom's-court, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. I know Ann Brewer personally, and have seen her at my house; she has lodged there several times; I keep a lodging room, and on Friday night, an officer came to enquire for 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding
               



            , and I was desired by her to say she did not lodge there, and I did say so. She had came to lodge with me on the Monday previous; she was an entire stranger to me, and Mrs. Brewer brought her to my house as a servant out of place; they brought a trunk with them, and a hat-box, which I understood were Ann Harding's own: Brewer came to sleep with her, and did so, that same night. On the next night Brewer brought a young man, and slept with him. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding
               



             gave me a parcel, and said she wished it to go to Wood'smews, Park-lane; it might be a small parcel tied up; but I don't know what it was tied up in. I offered to take it myself; but she said, she did not exactly wish her sister to know where she was. This parcel was to go to her sister's. I accordingly took the parcel, and she desired me to give it to a porter; I asked for the money to pay him, and she said her sister would pay him, and be glad of it. I directed it; but I don't know the name; it was to Wood'smews, and as I was going to my work, I took it to the Green Man and Still, in Oxford-street, and there got a man to take it, whose name I have since learned to be Sweeting. It was the morning before thishappened that Harding and Brewer went out with a bundle. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding
               



             said she was going to her cousin's in Swallow-street, and I saw them make up the bundle on the Tuesday night. I went with 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding
               



             and my wife to the play; I paid for myself, and Ann Harding treated my wife. She went to the Regency Theatre with my wife on the Friday night following, and I went in after them, and found them sitting in the pitt, and I took Harding to her sister between twelve and one that night; I took her first to a sister of hers in Park-lane, who would not admit her, and then I took her to 
               
                  Sophia 
                  Campbell
               



            's, in Cumberland-street.
Harding. Q. Did you not break the box open - A. No, my lord; but if she had asked me I would, because she said she had lost the key.


                  ANN 
                  SAUNDERS
               



            . On Monday evening, the 15th of January, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding
               



             and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Brewer
               



             came to my house; she brought nothing with them the first time; but they did at about half past three o'clock; 
               
                  Ann 
                  Brewer
               



             asked me if the other could have a lodging for that night; I told her I could not give her an answer then; but I would when my husband came home; when they were going they asked me to get a kettle boiled, and they would come and get some tea; they brought a small trunk, and a handbox, and said there were Ann Harding's; it was then settled that 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding
               



             was to have a lodging at our house, my husband was come home. They asked me if I would go with them to Covent Garden Theatre; Harding paid for all three, and when we were in the Theatre, Harding took out a one-pound note from her pocket, and gave it to me to take care off; Mrs. Brewer told her I should keep it safer than she, and she had it the next morning. On the Tuesday morning, they had both gone out in a coach together, and had taken a very large bundle, and a pelisse; that pelisse was a cloth one, and Ann Harding took it across her arm; it was a light brown one; I did not see what the other things were that they took in the bundle; they returned together to the house; but I can't exactly say at what time; they did not bring any of the things back with them; I did not see that pelisse afterwards. When we were going to the Theatre, I asked Harding where she had taken her things, and she said to her cousin's in St. Paul's-church-yard, where she was going again; she said she was going to live there; she sold me two silver salt spoons, and half a silk handkerchief; that was on the Tuesday that she sold the salt spoons, and on the Wednesday the silk handkerchief. On the Thursday I had some black lace, and she said she should like it, and would exchange a gold ring for it, which she did. I returned her the things on the Friday night; I did not return her the ring, because it was in pledge; I have since redeemed it, and have it now; I understood that this ring which I have on my finger is Mrs. Campbell's. My husband took Harding up at the play; Brewer was not with her then. The trunk was at my longings; Plank took it away on the Saturday morning; that was the trunk that 
               
                  Ann 
                  Harding

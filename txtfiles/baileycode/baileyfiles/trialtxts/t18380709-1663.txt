ANN BRENNAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of June, 1 pair of shoes, value 4s., the goods of 



Charles Walter, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE SPELLER
. I am shopman to Charles Walter, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Mary-le-bone. On the 26th of June, I saw the prisoner in our shop—her conduct excited my attention—I searched her and found tains pair of shoes hid in her apron under her cloak—they were my master's, and I had seen them half-an-hour before—I asked her before I searched her what she had picked up, a handkerchief or what, and she said she had picked up nothing.

Prisoner. Did I not take these shoes out and go to pawn them at another place, and then you followed me and accused me of taking a handkerchief—these shoes are mine—they had been in my possession at twelve o'clock that day. Witness. I am certain they were ours, and we had not aid them.

Prisoner's Defence, I was going to pledge these shoes—I asked 2s.—they offered 1s.—I left the shop to try to get what I wanted at another shop—the prosecutor searched me, he took them from me, and told me to go about my business—but knowing they belonged to me, I followed him to the shop and demanded them—he marked them and gave me in charge.





THOMAS BAYNE
 (police-constable D 79.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 39.—


Transported for Seven Years.

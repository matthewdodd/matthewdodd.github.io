Wm Deal, junior. The oats and barley were lost out of my father's barn about the first week in January, and on the 26th of the same month they were found in the prisoner's house; we had a suspicion of him and got a warrant to search his house; it was in two sacks, one that is our's, that was taken with the corn out of the barn; (the sack produced) I can swear to that sack; I know that sack to be my father's property.

            . Last Monday was three weeks, going to my labour between three and four in the morning. I met the prisoner with a sack on his back:

                   Deal
               



             deposed to the sack the corn was in.

            . I searched the prisoner's house, and found the barley in a sack under the stairs, and the corn in another part of the house; I took him and the sacks before the justice; there the sacks were sealed up, they have never been opened since.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

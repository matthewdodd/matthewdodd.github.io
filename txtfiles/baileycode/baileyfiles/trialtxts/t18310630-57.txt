            . I live on Back-hill


, and am a brushmaker
. I was up stairs on the 4th of June, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I looked out of the window, and saw the brushes in the street, ten or fifteen yards from my house- I went down; my wife had picked them up - the prisoner had run away, and was brought back.

            . I am a smith. I saw the prisoner throw the brushes down - I had seen him take them off the wall at the prosecutor's; he walked off with them, and when there was an alarm he threw them down - I saw them picked up; he was a stranger.

            . I was watching the prisoner and two more, as I came up Back-hill; I watched them half an hour, then went into Mr. Winstanley's house, and watched them again; I saw the prisoner unhook the brushes from the prosecutor's door - I ran out, and took him.

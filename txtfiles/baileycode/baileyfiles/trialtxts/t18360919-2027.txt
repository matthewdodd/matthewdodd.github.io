JAMES GREEN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
25th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Aubone Altham Surtees, from his person.






AUBONE ALTHAM SURTEES
. I am a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, and live in Earl-street, Blackfriars. On the 25th of August I was passing through Fisher's-court towards the Temple, at a quarter before eleven o'clock—I heard some one pressing on me—I turned round, and two people passed me—I put my hand to my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone—I went in front of these two people, the prisoner was one—I saw my handkerchief in his left breast—I was going to take hold of him—he turned, and ran down the passage to the gas-works, where he was taken—he said to the people around him, "What does that gentleman want? I have got nothing of his"—I felt him, and the handkerchief was not about him—it was brought by another person to me—this is it.





THOMAS WEETCH
. I live at Three-crown-court, Bream's-buildings, Chancery-lane. On the 25th of August I was in a court leading from Dorset-street to Water-lane—I saw the prosecutor put his hand to his pocket—he turned and said, he was robbed, and tried to catch hold of the person who he thought robbed him—he missed his hold, and the prisoner ran away—I followed with others, I believe—I picked up a handkerchief in the court, in the direction in which the prisoner ran from the prosecutor—I cannot say who dropped it.





WALTER FORD
. I am a policeman. And I have the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence.—There was no one saw me take it or drop it—I never had it.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

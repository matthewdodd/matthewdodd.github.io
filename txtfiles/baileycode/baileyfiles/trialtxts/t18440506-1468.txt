1468. 




JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 pewter-pot, value 1s. 6d., the goods of Thomas Rouse; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MOSES CHURCH
. I am in the service of Thomas Rouse, of Nicholas-street, New North-road. We lost this pot out of the house—we never let any go out of the house.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I was tent to the prisoner's house—I know it was his house, because I found some property there which he said was his wife's—I found this pot and three others there, and a tin kettle to melt the pots in—it has some pewter in it now—I saw a girl in the house who he said was his daughter.





CHARLES ATKINS
 (police-constable S 91.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person—he had also been convicted before that.




GUILTY
. Aged 41.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

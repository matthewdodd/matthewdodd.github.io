            . I am clerk to mess. Chase and Cox, brewers; the prisoner was employed occasionally as a porter
 there. On the 17th of March, about seven in the evening, Mr. Cox was talking to him, I went to them, Mr. Cox said he has robbed the yard; see what he has got. I pulled by his great coat, and took from under it five iron butt hoops; (produced in court) they are the property of my masters; and I am certain he took them from 2 parcel that lay in the yard. I took him before the justice, there he acknowledged he took them.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

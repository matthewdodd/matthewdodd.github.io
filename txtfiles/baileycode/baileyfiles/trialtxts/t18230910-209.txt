            . The female prisoner took a lodging at my house for herself and husband. They both came and lived together for four months. The lodgings were furnished. On the 31st of August, the articles stated in the indictment were missed; they still remained in the lodging - we had them secured. The man said, he certainly knew they were gone, but did not say how they went.

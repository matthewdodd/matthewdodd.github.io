            . Last Monday I was in Bartholomew fair


 at about half an hour past eight at night, I was going along under a gateway, there was a mob of people; I felt something pull at my pocket; I immediately put my hand to my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone; a young man my acquaintance had hold of the prisoner, I stepped up to him and took my handkerchief out of his hand, (produced and deposed to.)

            . I was with the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of his pocket, I laid hold of him; Mr. Linley took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's hand; we dragged him along, and by accident met with a constable, and gave him charge of the prisoner.
Prisoner's defence.
I had just done work, and I went to Bartholomew-fair; there were two young lads before me; they picked this handkerchief from the ground, it was not worth any thing; they threw it away and I picked it up, and the gentleman came and collared me directly.

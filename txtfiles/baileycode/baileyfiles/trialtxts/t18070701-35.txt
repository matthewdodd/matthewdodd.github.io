. On Saturday the 30th of May, about half past six in the evening, I was in the the club room attending a benefit society; hearing a noise below at the foot of the stairs I came down, I found the prisoner scuffling with my wife, he was endeavouring to get out of the house; I laid hold of the prisoner, my wife informed me that he had stole a quart pot; in the scuffle the quart pot fell from under his coat; we scuffled and he got outside of the door; he had a bag, I insisted upon examining it; I found two pint pots which belonged to other publicans.

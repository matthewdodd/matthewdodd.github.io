            . I live at South Lambeth, and am clerk
 to my brother. On the 31st of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on the approach to London-bridge


, on the London side, and felt my pocket become very light; I immediately turned, and saw the prisoner behind me - he was alone, and the only person who was close to me: I saw his hands pass from his own clothes, which made me suspect him; he went towards the paling - I followed him - he crossed the path, and paid something to see a show; I asked for a Policeman - the beadle of the bridge was fetched: I stated the circumstance to him - he took him, and at the watch-house my handkerchief was found in his breeches.

            . I am beadle of London-bridge. -I took the prisoner, and told him the gentleman had lost his handkerchief: he said he had not got it - I searched at the watch-house, and found it in the flap of his breeches; I asked him where it was - he said, "I have not got it," and on searching I found six other handkerchiefs on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was on Fish-street-hill - I saw a boy throw the handkerchief down, and picked it up.

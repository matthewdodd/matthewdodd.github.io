. On the 16th of September, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the copper was safe in an out-house in the yard; next morning, about ten o'clock, I missed the carpet, and found the copper pulled down, and taken away, They must have got over three gardens to get at the out-house. On the 20th of September I saw them at Bow-street.
JOHN DAVIS. I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 17th of September the prisoner passed me in Great Russell-street with the copper on his head, the carpet was tied round it - I stopped him. He said he brought it from Hampstead; after that he said he bought them of a man in the road, and then that he found them in Harper's-fields. I afterwards fitted the copper to the prosecutrix's place, and it corresponded exactly.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

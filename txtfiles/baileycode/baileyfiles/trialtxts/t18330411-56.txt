JOHN SQUIRE. My dwelling-house is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch


; I keep the house, and am a lady's shoemaker
. On the 23rd of March, about ten o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes from my window; I was at work in the kitchen underneath - I got up, looked up, and saw the shoes in his hand; he went away - I went up, went out, and secured him in Finsbury-passage, and gave him into custody; a square of glass was out of the window before, and a piece of pasteboard was nailed in instead of the glass, all round, with about a dozen nails - I had noticed it quite secure that morning; it covered the whole space, and was nailed regularly round - he had pushed that down; these are the shoes.




               GUILTY * of stealing only
            . Aged 14.

JOHN BAKER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of November, 1 handkerchief, value 4d., the goods of 



William Haynes, from his person.






WILLIAM HAYNES
. I live in Noble-street. At half-past five o'clock, in the evening of the 13th of November, I was going down Princes-street, I saw two boys following me, I watched them half-way down the street, they separated—I followed the prisoner, he threw my handkerchief on the ground—I followed him, took him, and picked this handkerchief up—I did not see how it was taken out, it was done behind me—I could not

have dropped it—he begged I would let him go—he said he did not do it, it was not him—he persisted in it.





CHARLES HOLT
. I stopped the prisoner at the top of Tokenhouse-yard—the prosecutor was about forty yards behind him—he was running fast.

Prisoner. I was running, and was turning to hear what the cry of "Stop thief" was. Witness No, he was driving on as fast as he could, making through the narrow passage.

Prisoner's Defence. I never had the handkerchief in my hand; I never saw it till he came to the station.




GUILTY
.* Aged 13.—


Transported for Ten Years—Convict Ship.

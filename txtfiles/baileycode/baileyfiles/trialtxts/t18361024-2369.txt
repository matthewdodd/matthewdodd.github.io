JOHN MASON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of October, 2 blankets, value 1l.; and 1 counterpane, value 12s.; the goods of 



Thomas Blackwell.






THOMAS SAUNDERS
. I am a pawnbroker, in Farringdon-street, I have a counterpane and two blankets, which were pawned at our shop, on the 12th of October, by the prisoner.





THOMAS BLACKWELL
. This property is mine—I lodged at Mrs. Mason's—it was taken from her bed-room—the prisoner lived in the house with his father, who is a labourer.





THOMAS ROSE
. I am a policeman. The prisoner's mother gave him in charge, on the 13th of October, in the Liverpool-road, Islington, for robbing the lodgings—she saw him in the road, and charged him with it.





HANNAH MASON
. I am the prisoner's mother. I left him in the room with his brother—he says his brother put him up to do this—I could not charge him with it—I told the policeman to catch him for me, and bring him home—he said he could not do that; he must take him to the station-house—he

had no breakfast that morning, as his father had punished him so.




GUILTY. Aged 13.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.





Transported for Seven Years.

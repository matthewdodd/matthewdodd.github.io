            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Baldwin-street, City Road


. On the 2d of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was weighing ten firkins of butter, and lost one out of the shop.

            . I was in Baldwin-street, and saw the three prisoners standing near the prosecutor's door - I ran out, and stood by the hospital, opposite Brooks's, as I thought they were after no good, and saw one of them take the firkin and lift it up - all three went together. I followed them to No. 29, George's-row, John's-row. I am sure the prisoners are the three men. Two of them carried it - they changed with each other.

            . About nine o'clock I went, by direction of the last witness, to No. 29, George's-row, and found the three prisoners smoking their pipes in the back room. I found the firkin of butter in the yard in a shed, covered over with another tub.

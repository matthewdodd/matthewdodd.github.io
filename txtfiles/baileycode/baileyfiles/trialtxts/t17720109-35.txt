- Bannister. I live in the Back-road, Islington


. A great many houses have been plundered of their lead there. I was determined to watch who stole it. I watched several nights. In the night between the 2d and 3d of December I heard a noise on the tops of the house; at last I heard a piece of lead fall; then I heard another piece fall. After some time I heard the lead rattling below. Accordingly I went to the place; there I saw the prisoner with the lead upon his shoulder. On seeing me, he threw the lead down, and ran away. I pursued and took him. I examined the house where the lead fell, and it appeared that it had been cut from a house lately occupied by Mr. Peters; that was the only house of five or six that had not been plundered.
Q. How do you think he got up?
Bannister. By the wateredge of the next house.

Prisoner's Defence
I went to find a place to sleep in. I took this bag up, not knowing what it was. I had not been a-top of the house.

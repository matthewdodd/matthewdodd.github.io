JAMES SMITH
. I keep a beer-shop in Marylebone-lane. On Sunday evening, the 6th of February, about ten o'clock, I missed from my bar a dark blue great-coat, a pair of silver spectacles, a china mug, and scentbottle—I had seen them all safe at five—the scent-bottle now produced is mine—it has a ring of gold round it, by which I can swear to it





WILLIAM CUMMING

LOUISA HUMPHREYS
. I live in Bainbrjdge-street, St. Giles's. On Sunday evening, the 6th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner come home dressed in a dark blue coat, which I had never seen him in before—I lived in the same house then—he gave me this scent-bottle that same evening—he said he had bought the coat—he had his own coat on underneath it—he said next day he had sold it to a Jew in Monmouth-court—I afterwards went to Lascelles-court, and took the scent-bottle with me.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not give her the bottle. The coat I had on was a brown one, which I had borrowed of a young man, as it was a wet night.

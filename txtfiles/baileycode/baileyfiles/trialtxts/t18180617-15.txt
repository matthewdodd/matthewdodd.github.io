HENRY DALE. I am a coal-undertaker
. On the 23d of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, as I was crossing Lombard-street


 to the Post-office, I was told that I had lost my handkerchief - I turned round, found it on the pavement, and picked it up. The officer brought the prisoners forward.

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of May I saw the prisoners walking close behind the prosecutor, in Lombard-street. Knowing Bois, I watched them, and saw Greaves take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket and hand it to Bois. I caught hold of him, the handkerchief fell to the ground - I called to the prosecutor, who picked it up. I took the prisoners.

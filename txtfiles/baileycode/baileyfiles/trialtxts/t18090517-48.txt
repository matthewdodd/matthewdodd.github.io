            ; we are brick-makers




.
Q. Have you any houses - A. We have; in Globe-row, in the hamlet of Mile End Town


. They were all of them covered with lead.
Q. Was any part of the lead at any time taken away - A. There has been lead taken away from one part of the premises. I think about the 22nd of March a person of the name of Gardiner came and informed me that he had taken a man with lead on his person; I went to his house, he shewed me the lead that he had taken from this man; I desired the lead to be taken to the place from whence lead was missed; I went with him; I compared the lead with the place, and it appeared exactly to fit it; I was not present when Mr. Gardiner found the lead on the prisoner.

            . On the 20th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in my field, he was carrying this lead wrapped up in a sack; on seeing me he turned back; it was just about dusk; I knew him before. I had a young child in my arms; I gave it to my brother. I ran after him and laid hold of the end of the bag, behind him, I asked him what he had there; he replied, what is that to you. I held fast of the bag and looked him in the face, and said what is it you have got; he said he had nothing belonging to me; I told him it belonged to somebody else; I should stop him and the lead too. I took hold of his collar, he shoved me from him; I took hold of him again and called for my brother; I repeated a third name, to make it appear there was three of us, and when my brother drew near he said if I would let him go quietly, without holding of him, he would go with us; on them conditions I let him go; he walked about twenty paces and then he ran away; I pursued him half way across the fields; he escaped.
Q. How long afterwards was it before you saw him again - A. On Saturday morning last, between five and six o'clock.
Q. That is not quite two months ago - A. No; my brother came and told me that a man of that description had just past by; I told him to watch where he went to, I would be with him presently; he said he thought he went down Grove-row; he made an attempt at a gate, to perceive whether it was fast or not; at a house that was robbed a few nights before. I went the back way, and met him nearly opposite of Mr. Pagett's; I came upon him by surprise; he asked me what I wanted with him, I told him I wanted him for what he had done before, and I thought he was after no good then.
Q. What had been his trade, do you know - A.He told the justice he was a lumper. I only know him to be a bad character. I delivered him to the officer, who took him before the magistrate.
Q.When you took him first of all, did you take possessionof the lead - A. Yes, he left the lead, and I secured it. I marked the lead. The prisoner said as I was coming down the road, this would but detain him a few months; and he would he d - d if he did not serve me out when he came out of trouble; with the most bitter oaths and expressions.

            . I am a plumber.
Q. You saw the lead that Mr. Gardiner informed you had been found on the prisoner - A. Yes; the magistrate desired me to go and fit the lead to the place where it was supposed to be taken off; it did fit, there is no doubt it was the lead that covered Mr. Stanley's premises, it was a whole gutter; there is forty-one pounds weight of it; it is worth ten or eleven shillings.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.

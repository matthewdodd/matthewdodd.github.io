ELIZABETH SWEITZER
. I am the wife of William Sweitzer, of Upper Rosoman-street—he is a tailor. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 23rd of February—a man was with her, whom she represented as her husband—she said her name was Emery—on the 20th of March I missed a looking-glass—it had hung on the wall, and a teaboard had been hung in its place—I went to the pawnbroker's, and found she had pawned the glass and other things—she began to take them the day after she came to my lodging—the value of them altogether is 2l. 10s.—they had been let to her with the lodging.





JOHN DAVIS
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker, In Exmouth-street. I have two blankets, a sheet, a pillow, and several other articles—I took in eight of them, on different dates, from the prisoner—there are ten in all.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM MARTIN
 (police-constable G 213.) I took the prisoner, and round on her fifty duplicates; ten are for these articles.

(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that one Emery had persuaded her to pledge the articles to enable him to get his own tools out of pledge.)




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

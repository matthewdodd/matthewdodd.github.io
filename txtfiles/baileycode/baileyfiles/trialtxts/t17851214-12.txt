I am a grocer, I look after the prosecutor's cattle, I receive money and pay bills for him, these six glasses were taken, four out of one chariot and two out of another chariot, which is Doctor Anderson's, the prosecutor pays for them, the frames were left behind, I found them two days after at the constable's of the night, in Queen-street, I tried them with the frames and they fitted very well.

I am a harness maker, I went with the prosecutor and tried the glasses, and they fitted; these glasses were in the chariots on Saturday, I saw every carriage in the range of coach-houses, the glasses to the front were up, and I saw the string project out.

             sworn.
I stopped the prisoner, with six glasses, the 26th of last month, before twelve at night, in Holborn, they were not in frames, they were under his arm without the frames, he passed by me, and I looked at him and called him, he made me no answer, so I followed him and asked him what he had, he said glasses, he brought them from the grinders in Newtoner's-lane, he said he was going to his master's, I asked who was his master, and he refused to tell me, I asked him his own name, and he refused to tell me; somebody passed by and looked at the glasses and said they were old, and the prisoner said what has that gentleman to do with it, nothing says I; and he asked me if I would have a glass of gin, I saw no watchman, and I thought he would break them, so I said I do not care if I do, so I took him into Feather's-court, and there was a watchman, and when he saw the lanthorn he would go no further, he offered me six-pence, and bid me spend it as I chose, I called the watchman to my assistance, and I took care of the glasses.

             sworn.
I am watchman in Featherstone-buildings, the last witness and the prisoner came together, the witness called out Smith, and I took he prisoner into custody with the glasses. The prisoner gave the glasses very quietly, and I took care of the glasses, he fell down and I fell down, he got up and ran down Featherstone-buildings, I ran after him and he was taken, the prisoner said the thief was gone down Hand-court; the prisoner is the same man I had first in custody with the glasses.

Mr. Bray. You may look over ten pounds worth before you find six fit as these do.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I kicked against the glasses and broke off one of the corners, and was taken with them, I told the watchman that I found them in Newtoner's-lane; they threw me down and beat me very much because I ran away to save the blows.

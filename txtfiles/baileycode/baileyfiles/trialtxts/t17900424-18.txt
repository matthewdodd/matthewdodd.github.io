                   LOWE
               



             sworn.
I know both the prisoners. I am a pawnbroker
. On Sunday, the 21st of March, I lost one pair of ribbed stockings, value 3 s. one piece of printed linen, value about half a crown, and six muslin caps, value about ten shillings; I had lost the other things in the indictment previous to that, but cannot say the day. On the 21st of March I had a few friends to dine with me; and we went up to Islington after dinner: the prisoner Mason was our servant
; I left word with her, that we should come back to tea; when I returned back, I found the prisoner Mason very much confused; I found my dining room and bed room, which contains a great part of our property, was safe: when I came down stairs I found the prisoner Mason at the street door; I said, Betty, did somebody knock at the door? says she, I thought so, Sir: my wife came home with her friends, and the prisoner then asked her leave to go to see her sister, at Islington, who was not well; Mrs. Lowe seemed rather angry, that she should ask to go out that night, but she gave her leave to go out, and to return in good time: between eight and nine my apprentice and a warehouse boy came in, and went into the kitchen, and found a parcel, which he brought into the parlour to his mistress; and we consulted what to do, and in about an hour after that the prisoner Mason returned home; and soon after she came in we procured an officer; the things were brought forward, and she denied knowing any thing at all of them.
Where were those goods when you went out in the morning? - In the shop window; they were goods for sale; we had her boxes brought down into my parlour; and there were a variety of articles, the greatest part of them had my shop marks; they consist of linen handkerchiefs, aprons, cotton stockings, &c. the things are all in Court; I was present when her boxes were searched; and I can say with certainty that every article we have here is mine: the prisoner was taken to New Prison: I suspected the prisoner Perry, and I got a search warrant, and went to his master; the prisoner Perry was in the yard; he went up stairs before I did; we desired to see his box; he brought it immediately nearer to the door than it had been, and he opened the box; I do not believe the box was then locked, though the key was in it; in opening the box there were several articles that I laid my hands on; and he said these articles were given him by the prisoner Mason; these things had been lost prior to the 21st of March.
What was the value of each of those articles? - They were some pocket handkerchiefs, and half a neck handkerchief; the neck handkerchief was worth one shilling, and the pocket handkerchiefs worth one shilling a piece; the boy was examined, and very frankly told us, that all these articles were given him by the prisoner Mason: having further information against Mason, I went to Islington, to

            's, and desired to see the things that were brought there, tied up in a handkerchief; there I found, to my great surprize, a fine Holland sheet, a large damask table cloth,six pillow cases, and some other small napkins and towels; she said, that was all that they had; soon after she came to my house with some more things, but I only know from information where she got them: she was examined the next day at Mr. Blackborough's, and the examination was taken down in writing.
Mr. Knowlys, Prisoners Counsel. You are a pawnbroker? - Yes.
Have you any body interested in the business besides yourself? - No; I am the sole owner in the business: the prisoner had lived with me seven months.
Of course she had access to the things in the house? - Yes; particularly that day.

             sworn.
I know the prisoner Mason: I remember some goods being brought to my house by her, first a blanket, and sheet, and two or three towels; they were brought by 
               
                  Thomas
                   Perry
               



            ; and Mason brought a bundle, containing one fine sheet; I never opened it till Mr. Lowe come; I put it in the drawer; she brought also a table cloth and two pillow cases; she gave me a child's frock once, for some work I had done, which she said she bought of her mistress; there were only two sheets; she said, she bought them of her mistress.
(The things produced and deposed to.)

             sworn.
I am apprentice to Mr. Lowe. On the 21st of March, the same evening, I returned home, and turning down the table, I found a pair of stockings, and other things; I informed my master; and they appeared to be his property.

             sworn.
I took charge of Mason: I found the things in her box, and some in Perry's box, which he very readily owned.

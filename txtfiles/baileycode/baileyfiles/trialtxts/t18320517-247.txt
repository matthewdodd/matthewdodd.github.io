            . I saw the prisoner and a little boy standing at the top of Milton-street - they went behind the prosecutor, and I saw the little boy take his hand from the prosecutor's pocket; they walked away up Fore-street - the prisoner was standing behind the little one; I am sure of his person - the boy ran away when he saw the prisoner was taken.
THOMAS NORWOOD. I was in Fore-street, and saw a boy take a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket and give it to the prisoner, who stood just behind him; he was secured, and the handkerchief found.

            . I am a marshalsman. I heard a witness say the prisoner had gone up Milton-street - I followed, and took him and the boy, but in scuffling with the prisoner the other party let the boy go; I found the handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I beg for mercy.

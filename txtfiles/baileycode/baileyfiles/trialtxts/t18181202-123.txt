            . I am a widow, and live at Islington


, and take in washing
. On the 12th of November I wrapped these things up with others, and laid them on the mangle. The prisoner came and asked if I was at home; I went into the yard, and left my child in care of the room. I sent the things home, and was informed they were not all there. I suspected the prisoner, as nobody had been to the door but her. I went to her room, and asked if she knew where they were? She said I might be d - d. On the 6th of November I found them at Sowerby's the pawnbroker.

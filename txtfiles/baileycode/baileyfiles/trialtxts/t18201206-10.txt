            . I am a student at Cambridge
. On the 27th of November, about a quarter before two o'clock, I was going through Temple-bar


 into the city, and felt the skirt of my coat pulled. I missed my pocket-book. I immediately turned round, collared the prisoner, and saw it in his hand - he threw it down - I caught hold of him, and picked it up. It contained nothing valuable.

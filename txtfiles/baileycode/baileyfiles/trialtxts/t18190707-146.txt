            . I am a labourer at Mr. Spencer's
, Mill Hill, Hendon


, and had the care of a house where all this property was. I left the house locked up between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, returned about twelve, found it broken open, and all the property gone. I had seen the prisoners about the house the morning before. They were taken the same day.

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 12th of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I apprehended the prisoners in Oxford-street. Each had a bundle. I took them to the watch-house. They said they found them in a ditch. The bundles contained all the property.

JOHN MORGAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of March, 1 case of surgical instruments, value 3l.; the goods of 



John Hammersley.






WILLIAM HENRY SOUTHAN
. I am in partnership with John Hammersley, but the instruments were his private property. On the 2nd of March, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the house, and inquired for my partner—I said he was not at home, but I expected him soon—I asked him into one of our surgeries—another person came into the other surgery, and I fetched the instruments to perform an operation—after the other person was gone I asked the prisoner into that room where there was a fire—I was then called out to visit a case—I left the case of instruments on the table with the prisoner, at half-past twelve o'clock—I returned at four o'clock, and found the case of instruments was missing—it has never been found.





RICHARD MOUNT
. I reside in York-square. I was at Mr. Hammersley's on the 2nd of March—I saw the prisoner in the surgery, about half-past twelve o'clock—I saw the case of instruments there—there were two persons came into the dispensary, and then the prisoner passed through, and said he would call again—I then went into the room, and the case was gone—no other person had been in the room from the time that I saw the instruments there, till I returned again.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all about them.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner on a similar charge.)

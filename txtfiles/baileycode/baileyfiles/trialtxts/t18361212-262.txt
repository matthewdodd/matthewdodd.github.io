MARGARET REEVES
. I am the wife of John Reeves, a labourer, and live in York-court, Marylebone. I was confined—the prisoner attended me five or six days, and left without notice—I missed these things, they are mine—I was lying ill in bed at the time.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not send me to pawn them? Witness. A. No, not one of them.






JOHN REEVES
. I saw the prisoner after she left, and said, "Biddy, you ought not to have served us so"—she made no answer—I found my wife's cap on her head, and my wife's bonnet hanging up, and my wife's shawl was on her back, in the room in which she was living—I asked her to come to my house—she came, and then confessed she had pawned the other things.





JOSEPH WOLSTENHOLME
. I produce all these things—two of them I took it pledge myself of the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ELIZA RILEY
. I am the wife of James Riley, and live with my mother, Mary Ann Wilton, who keeps a stationer's shop in Jamaica-terrace. On the 15th of June I lost two hymn-books from the window.





JAMES BARELAY
. I produce these books. I caught the prisoner on the 15th of June, running from the shop with them.

Prisoner. I was looking into the shop—a boy came to the door, and asked me to hold them while he tied them up—he saw the gentleman running across the road, and ran away. Witness. There were other boys with him—they were not all running together.





JANE BARELAY
. I was looking out of window, and saw the prisons leave

the others, and get into the shop, put his hand into the window, and take
the books.

Prisoner. I did not take them, a little boy did.




GUILTY.* Aged 15.—



Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

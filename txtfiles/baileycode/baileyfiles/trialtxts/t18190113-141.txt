. The prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some pins, which he had been about in the morning. I turned round to reach them, and saw him make a snatch at some shawls, but did not succeed. I showed him some pins, and turned round for some others - he then took a shawl from the window, and put it under his apron - I secured him, and saw him drop it. He was searched, and 3 1/2 d. found in his pockets. The pins would have come to 5 s. 10 d.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it.

            , the 16th of April
.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Barrs) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?
Barrs. Yes, my Lord, she was my Servant
; she left my Service the 15th of April
: I miss'd the Ear-Rings about an Hour after she was gone.
Q. How long did she live with you?
Barrs. Only a Week, my Lord: She came again the next Morning after she went away; I did not immediately charge her 'till I had got somebody in the House.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner.) Would you ask your Mistress any Questions?
Prisoner. I did not take them willfully.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  James 
                  Burgess 
               



            .) What do you know of this Matter?
Burgess. I was sent for by Mrs. Barrs; I am Beadle; she said there was a Difference between a Maid Servant and her over Night, and that in the mean time she miss'd a Pair of Diamond Ear-Rings; but she would not charge her 'till she had made a diligent Search for them. I said to the Maid, if you know any thing of them tell your Mistress, to put her out of her Fears; but there was a Gentleman in the House, one Mr. Russel, who insisted to know were she lodg'd that Night; so she said she was to pay Three-pence and sit up all Night: Her Mistress ask'd her how she came by that Three-pence, as she had no Money when she went away; she then said she had pawn'd her checqu'd Apron for 18 d. at such a Pawmbroker's; then we went to enquire where she said she had been over Night; and by what I heard of her Character I thought it was sufficient to go back again and make an Enquiry: At first she stifly deny'd it, but afterwards came to a Confession; she confess'd she had them, and deliver'd them to me, and I deliver'd them to Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



            .
Court. Sir Thomas, give an Account of this Affair.
De Veil. My Lord, the Prisoner at the Bar was brought by this Witness before me, and deliver'd these Ear-Rings.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Mrs. Barrs.) Madam, are these the Ear-Rings you lost ?
Barrs. Yes, my Lord, they are my Daughter's, 
               
                  Frances 
                  Barrs

                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Thompson 
               



            .) Do you know any thing of this Woman, the Prisoner ?
Thompson. She was with me at work; but had I heard so much of her before as since, she should not have been employ'd by me.

            . I am the master of a ship
 in the coal-trade. On the 21st of August, I was, passing through Lower Chapman-street


, between nine and ten at night. A man came past me on the right side, and snatched at my watch ribbon. I immediately called out, stop thief. He had not ran more than twenty yards before he was stopped by the patrol, and taken to the watchhouse. The seal, key, and ribbon, were picked up close by where the prisoner was taken.

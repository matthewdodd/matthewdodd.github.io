            . I am a laundress; the prisoner at the bar iron'd for me; I believe I lost every week, for about 6 months, some trifle or another of linnen. I wash'd for 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Virthey

            ; on the 29th of May the prisoner came at 6 in the morning, and took an opportunity to go up stairs, in the room where 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Austin 
               



             my maid lay, and took 1 l. 9 s. 6 d. her property. The prisoner endeavoured to drive it into all our heads (after the money was missing) that a young man that lodg'd in our house had taken it; he was taken up, and before justice Wright she insisted upon it he had it; but upon her being ask'd about it, she owned she had taken it herself out of the maid's drawer; she own'd to that, and to the taking 3 caps, before the justice. I found one handkerchief, one upon her neck in bridewell, and the other with 3 caps in her lodgings.

                  Austin 
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Turner; I lost 1 l. 9 s. 6 d. the prisoner at the bar, upon being charged with taking it, own'd she had taken it; I also heard her own to the taking 3 caps; I saw 3 caps and an apron found in her lodgings. My money was taken from out of the fore parlour where I lie.

The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

            , of St. Martin's-court


. On the 24th of October a pair of boots were taken from his shop - I had seen them two minutes before my master said they were gone; I ran out and met the prisoner in custody of the officer with them; they had been just inside the shop, on a heap of others.

            . I noticed the prisoner lurking about some time, and watched him: I saw him go into the passage and draw the boots; some persons were passing at the time, and I could not take him at the moment - he went up the court - I ran and took him; he threw the boots down and fell on them - I took him and them.
Prisoner. You said you did not see me take them at the office. Witness. I saw you drawing them, but did not see you finish taking them; I did not say I saw you take a boot, look at it, and put it down.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He has sworn falsely; I saw the boots on the ground, and was going to take them up.

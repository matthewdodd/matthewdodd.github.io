            . I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of Mr. Penrice's pocket as he was bargaining with a hackney coachman; the prisoner turned round the coach, I called to the next witness, who secured him.
Q. Did the prisoner attempt to run away?
Gillham. No, he did not seem to think I observed him.

That young man came to me as I went round the coaches, and took hold of me, but I did not know what it was for.

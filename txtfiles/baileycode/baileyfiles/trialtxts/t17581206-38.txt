            . I have 18 d. per week allowed me by the parish; I went on the 13th of last month for it, and left the prisoner in care of my things at home; and while I was gone, she robb'd me of the things mention'd in the indictment; I took her in the street, ( she us'd to go a hunting ) I had her to a house upon Addle-hill, there she confessed the taking of the things.

            . I went along with the prosecutrix, and when we returned, the prisoner was gone, and stript her of her all: she is only indicted for stealing the things she now has upon her back. The prisoner had nothing to say for herself.  


               Guilty. 10 d

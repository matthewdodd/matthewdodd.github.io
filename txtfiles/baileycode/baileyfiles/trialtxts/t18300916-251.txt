MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.
CHRISTIAN ROWBERRY. My mother and the prisoner lived together as man and wife, at No. 13, Park-street, Poplar


; I cannot say whether they were married - he called her his wife, and treated her as such; I am her daughter by a former husband, and am twelve years old. On Saturday evening, the 11th of September
, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came home, and sat on a chair by the fire - he did not seem quite sober; my mother took a chair, and sat down facing him - he pulled 5s. out of his tobacco-box, and gave it to her; she said,"We are very rich - we owe 3s. for rent, and what am I to do with this small trifle?" she meant poor - he got up in a great rage seemingly, and said, "Give it to me, I know what to do with it;" my mother said, "Oh no I wont give it to you, it don't belong to you;" he then gave her a blow on the temple with his double fist, with great violence - she did not fall; she had got up when he did, before the blow was given; the place turned red directly - we were in the front parlour; she then went out of the room into the kitchen; she shut the door, leaving me in the parlour - there are two kitchens down stairs; he walked about the room, and seemed in a great passion - my mother offered him no violence at all; in the course of a little time he went down stairs; he heard my mother speaking, I believe - I did not go down; I heard my mother scream as soon as he went down stairs, and I screamed also; he came up stairs after staying down there about a quarter of an hour, and then went out, but my mother came up stairs first, went out, and then he went out - my mother had come up stairs first; she did not enter the room where he was, but opened the street door and went out; he was in the room with me; he took his son out with him - my mother came in in about an hour, about nine o'clock; I observed then that her temple was very black, and she complained very much of her breast - that was all she complained of; she began to get tea ready, and while she was getting it, the prisoner came in - he did not say a word to her that I heard, nor did she say any thing to him - she put a cup and sancer before him, and began to pour him out some tea; he said,"You need not pour any out for me, I don't want any;" my mother said, "Then there is more for them that do;" be kept nagging at her - she said she did not want any discourse with him, for he was a drunken man and a brutein heart; he got up and said, "If you don't go out, I will kick you out;" she said, "You need not do that, for I can go out," and she went - my father went out in two or three minutes; my mother came in in about half an hour, and asked me if he was gone out - I said Yes; he did not come in all night - I saw him between one and two o'clock on Sunday morning; that was the first time he came in - nothing passed for about five minutes; my mothere would have said nothing to him at all, but his little boy was looking very steadfastly at him; my mother said, "Come away, child, for he is no example for any child to look at, but to bring them to the gallows"- my father was very drunk then; he got up, and said,"What is that you say?" he made his way towards her, and she flew out of the room, down into Mrs. Ralph's kitchen, and he went after her - I heard her scream as soon as he went down, but do not know what passed, for I staid in the parlour; my feet and legs were as unwell as they are now (the witness was unable to walk) - I heard her scream two or three times; Mr. Ralph ran down stairs from his bed-room, and Mr. Lachmere, who lives in the house, ran down; after that my mother ran up to me, took me out of the room, and sat with me on the first floor stairs; I heard the prisoner while we were there, tell Mr. Ralph he should leave him to-morrow, and he was to give him a receipt - Ralph told him to go in and lay down, and he would give him a receipt to-morrow; he kept asking for the receipt, and at last went in, shut the room door, locked it, and laid down - we only had one room; he did not know we were on the stairs: my mother then took me down into the kitchen with her - this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; she got her dinner boiled on the kitchen fire, eat it, and then went up into her own room; a little boy picked the lock with a knife - she immediately brought some rags out of the room for her and me to lay on the kitchen floor - I laid on the rags, and she sat up in a chair which Mrs. Ralph lent her; she did not go into the room all night - my father and her were not together after he locked himself in the room; my mother laid down by me about eleven o'clock at night, and in a little time went to sleep, but I was awake all night - between twelve and one o'clock I heard my father out of his room, in the passage, saying, Oh! could he but find her he would kill her; when my mother awoke I told her what I had heard - she said something to me, and groans directly came into her throat, and she immediately died; she only said one word, which was asking me if my father said it loud - she had not been in liquor at all on Saturday, not before she died; she did not at any time lift her hand against the prisoner, to strike him - she died at three o'clock, exactly.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the name of your own father? A. Rowberry, in his own country language; he was a Sweed - I do not recollect him: my mother has lived with the prisoner since last summer twelve months - her name before that was 
               
                  Ellen 
                  Robinson
               



             - every body called us so, but her own name was Rowberry; the first house she lived at with the prisoner was in Catherine-street - she was known there by the name of 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Robinson
               



            .
Q. Has she gone by the name of Robinson ever since the death of your father, till she lived with the prisoner? A. Yes - she was married to Rowberry at Islington church, but I cannot find any thing for it; when she lived with the prisoner she went by the name of Ellen McCarthy.
MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that your mother's name was Ellen or Eleanor? A. Eleanor; when any body used to call her Ellen she would say her name was Eleanor.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. How came you to tell me her name was Ellen? A. I thought you asked me whether her name was Robinson - she used always to say her name was Eleanor; I have been ill since last March - the prisoner provided for us all; he worked at the West Indiadocks - he had only 12s. in his tobacco-box; there had been no liquor in the room that day - my mother was in her own room all day, cleaning up; it might be between seven and eight, or nine o'clock when she went out - I do not know where she went; she was gone about half an hour each time - it was on Sunday that she told his son not to look at him, &c.: he got up, and said, "What is that you say?" she made him no answer, but went down, and he after her - Ralph and Lachmere came down directly they heard her scream; we had only a few beef bones boiling for broth, for dinner on Sunday - she had nothing else, no beer of any kind, nor spirits; she had no supper - she walked out both times on Saturday, but when she came in she complained of her breast - she got up as usual on Sunday.

            . I keep the house in which the deceased lived; it is in the parish of All Saints, Poplar - the prisoner came home on the Saturday, between five and six o'clock; I was down in the kitchen, and heard words between them, but could not distinguish what passed; I looked up stairs and heard the deceased say,"Three shillings of this is owing for rent, and what am I to do with the remainder?" the prisoner said, "Give it me, I know what to do with it;" she said "No, it is owing elsewhere, it is not yours;" I looked up to the room, saw her coming out of their room door, and the prisoner struck her - I ran up stairs, and asked her to come down; he struck her on the left side of the head with his double fist; that was the first blow I saw - I was at the foot of the stairs, and could not see whether it was violent; I ran to her assistance, and saw it swell directly; she said to him, "Oh! you rogue; Oh! you villian, here is an eye you have given me;" she then gave me half a crown, went into her own room, and shut the door - I had some conversation with her about the half-crown, and am sure she knew perfectly well what she was doing - I went into my own apartment, and had not been long down stairs before words occurred between them again, and she came down to me - the prisoner came after her, and struck her two or three times; I screamed murder - I was so terrified - I cannot say where he struck her, but it appeared to me about her head, for I stood between them to part them, as well as I could - she and I both screamed Murder! they appeared to be violent blows - he appeared in great anger - I did not notice that he said any thing; Mrs. Lachmere, came down - she took hold of the prisoner, and asked if he knew what he was about - upon that he struck her over her shoulder - it struck his wife, and knocked her down; Mrs. Lachmere fell with her - she fell against the kitchen-table, and upset it; he then kicked his wife as she lay on the ground- he kicked her on the stomach, between the two breasts; that was done purposely, for I saw him look at her, lift his foot, and kick her with violence; Mr. Lachmere came down and persuaded him to go up to his own room - he went up with him - he said the quarrel had been about money - I heard him call Mr. Lachmere into his own room, and say, "Look her Lash., I have got half a sovereign, but that is owing elsewhere;" I heard no more that night - the deceased had not been into my room all Saturday, till this happened - I had seen her pass on the stairs - she had no appearance of being in liquor - she appeared in good health; I did not see or hear the prisoner again till between one and two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, when I was taking up my dinner; I heard words again, and the deceased ran down to my room, screaming violently; McCarthy followed her into the room - he struck her with his double fist; it appeared to me to be on the head or shoulder - I screamed for my husband, who came down directly - Mr. and Mrs. Lachmere came down after him - my husband took him by the collar, pulled him out of our room, and he challenged my husband to go to fight - he appeared in liquour; the poor woman afterwards got down some rags - I gave her two chairs to sit or in the empty kitchen, and there she died - I got up at half-past five o'clock; a medical gentleman was sent for, and examined her.
COURT. Q. Was it a kick or a stamp he gave her? A. A kick.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the deceased before she lived with the prisoner? A. yes; she had lived with me in her first husband's time - he died at St. Kitt's; her name was Eleanor; I have heard her called Ellen - she answered to both names; she passed as the prisoner's wife - she always kept to her own room; she did not sit with me - she dined on Sunday about three o'clock, in the empty kitchen which I had lent her; I do not know whether she had been out that morning - she seemed to me to get the most blows about the head and shoulder, except the kick; the prisoner had offered to pay his rent and go directly - my husband said he should have the receipt tomorrow; Mr. Natorff was the first doctor that saw her, and he said she was not dead.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Mr. Natorff do any thing to her? A. Yes, he bled her - not above two drops came from her; he then had hot water put to her feet, and then he said she was dead - he was not present at the opening of her body.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he not examine the whole of her person? A. he turned her round and examined her.

            . I lived at this house. I went down to the kitchen on Saturday - the prisoner knocked his wife and me down, and bruised my right shoulder and side; I saw him on Sunday strike at his wife again, but cannot say whether she received the blow.

            . On the Saturday evening, between five and six o'clock, I was in Ralph's kitchen, and saw the prisoner kick his wife, but cannot say in what part of her body, as I was busy picking up my wife at the time.


                  JULIUS 
                  NATORFF
               



            . I am a surgeon, and a native of France. I was called in at a quarter past six o'clock on Monday morning, and found the deceased's thorax and abdomen warm - I opened a vein, and got, I suppose, half an ounce of blood; I at first did not suppose life was extinct, but put her feet into warm water, and found she was dead - I examined her minutely outside, but was not present when the body was opened: I detected no appearance of bruises whatever - I could discern no cause of death.
Cross-examined. Q. Finding her still warm, life could not have been extinct long? A. No, but it is impossible to say how long; it might have been half an hour - I examined the chest between the breasts; there was no bruise of any kind to be seen.
Q. Supposing a violent kick to have been given between the breasts about noon, do not you think there must be some external mark? A. There would be a rupture of some small vessels, and an extravasation of blood, which would make its appearance at some time, but when, no medical man could tell - if the vessels are deep-seated the appearance would not be so quick; if she had been beat on the temple and swelling followed, there would have been some appearance of it - my examination did not lead me to form the least idea that she had died from personal violence: I have said, that to my judgment she died of apoplexy - I asked the beadle if I should open the body; he said he had a medical man of his own - it is usual when two medical men see a body, for both to be present at the opening.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you? A. A surgeon; I keep an apothecary's shop at Limehouse, about ten minutes walk from where the woman died - I never saw her before.


                  MARMADUKE 
                  TATHAM
               



            . I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am surgeon of Poplar parish for this year; the beadle requested I would go immediately and examine the deceased - he pointed the body out to me, laying on a bed-tick; several people were there - I observed a few slight contusions on the anterior part of the head, a little on one side, I think on the right, and about the fourth rib was another contusion; I cannot say on which said - I did not think it would be material, as I did not conceive any external appearance could be of any consequence; I examined the abdomen externally, and on the lower part of it was a discoloration on each side a little below the navel - perhaps a little more to the right than the left; I then opened the head, the dura mater was in a perfect uninflamed healthy state - the next two membraues were also uninflamed and healthy; the lobes of the cerebrum, both anterior and posterior, were perfectly healthy- it was the most healthy brain I ever saw; I found a slight degree of inflammation in the lungs commencing, but not sufficient, in my opinion, to cause death - I then examined the abdomen, and on laying bare the intestines, I found, a little below the smaller portion of the last intestine, which covers the ilium, in the highest degree of inflammatian, and a considerable quantity of serum and some portion of coagulum lymph in the cavity of the abdomen, which was the consequence of the inflammation - the uterus was also inflamed; these are the principal appearances I observed - I have every reason to conclude that the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the intestines; the other causes had nothing whatever to do with the death, neither the signs about the head nor the inflammation of the lungs - I had frequently seen the woman before, having attended her child on the parish account; she was Mrs. McCarthy, and lived in Sophia-street, when I attended her - I never saw the prisoner till to-day.
Q. Could the appearances of inflammation, to which you ascribe her death, have been occasioned by a blow or kick in the stomach within twenty-four hours? A. There is no doubt of it; violence occasions inflammation, and there was every mark of inflammation and the result of violence - if it had been internal inflammation the appearance would have been very different; it was external inflammation - the Coroner and Jury viewed the body as I examined.
Cross-examined. Q. Your opinion is, that the inflammation of the ilium was the cause of her death? A. Certainly, that and no other - that intestine passes backwards and forwards in the lower part of the abdomen; it is principally below the navel; the jejunum begins where the ilium ends, but there is no fixed point of division, it is arbitrary - they are separated by an imaginary line.
Q. Is not the upper part of the ilium called the jejunum? A. Decidedly not; the intestine is five times the length of the body - the next intestine to the jejunum is the duodenum, that is the upper one of all next the stomach; that was in a perfectly healthy state, and was full.
Q. Now, would not a kick given between the breasts rather have inflamed the duodenum and jejunum than the ilium? A. But I observed no kick between the breasts that could not have produced the inflammation; if I had found the ilium as I did, and had not heard of what had happened, I should say it arose from external injury received in some way or other - I could come to no other conclusion; I dissected with care to ascertain if there was any hernia.
Q. Might not the same appearances of inflammation have arisen from other causes than violence? A. You make me something beyond human to decide what may be, but from the appearance of the body, I judge it arose from external violence; I examined the body between eleven and twelve o'clock - I was told by a person, whom I had never seen before that, some one had attempted to bleed her some hours after death - but I proceeded to examine the body as surgeon of the parish; the marks on the abdomen were sufficiently plain to see there had been contusions - they were only slight, but the woman dying so early, the appearances would not be so plain as they might be a few days after - they would not be quite so visible at six o'clock; nobody was present but my pupil.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you informed of the name or address of any medical man who had been there? A. Not at all - if I had I should not have objected to his being present at the opening.
COURT. Q. You confine the cause of death to the inflammation of the ilium? A. Decidedly so; blows, where the contusion was, might have caused the injury on that part - it corresponded with the commencing part of it, but spread both lower and higher; it was certainly connected with the contusion below the navel.
Q. Would inflammation of that sort produce sudden death? A. That depends on the constitution; inflammation increases much quicker with some than others; the appearances I saw might have arisen in four or six hours; inflammatory action proceeds at times very rapidly; dissolution from inflammation is generally sudden; I should have thought she must have felt considerable pain in the abdomen for some hours - death from inflammation sometimes takes place previous to mortification.

            . I saw the deceased after her death, but did not examine her till after Mr. Natorff was gone - I then saw a bruise on her forehead, on her left temple, and a bruise on her left side, between the left breast and hip, and an impression on the hip - this was the moment Mr. Natorff left - when he came he did not know she was dead; there was no other dead body in the house - I was not there when Mr. Tatham saw it.

                  SMITH
               



            . I am beadle of Poplar. I went to Ralph's, and saw the deceased; I knew her before, and knew her as Mrs. McCarthy - I was present when Mr. Tatham saw the body.
Prisoner's Defence. She never wished me to pay my debts - that was the beginning of my falling out with her on Saturday.

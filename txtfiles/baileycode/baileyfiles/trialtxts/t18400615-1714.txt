1714. 




GEORGE RYAN
was indicted

for stealing, on the 
14th of March, 3 gowns, value 18s.; and 1 shift, value 2s.; the goods of 



John M'Kail; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH M'KAIL.
I am the wife of John M'Kail. I was servant at a public-house in Westminster—there was a fire there—I lost three gowns and a shift—these are them—(looking at them.)





CHARLES PINER.
I was hired to dig the things out of the ruins at the fire—I found two of these gowns—the master of the premises told me to tell the servant to come and look at them.





JAMES POWELL
(police-constable C286.) I stopped the prisoner in Piccadilly on the 14th of March—he was carrying a bundle of these things—I asked where he got them from—he said at the station-house that they were his sister's, who lived at No. 45, Piccadilly—I went, and no one there knew him—I afterwards ascertained that they were stolen from the fire in Jermyn-street, about a month before.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up, and as there was no one there, I thought they were rags.





WILLIAM TOOLE.
(police-sergeant D5.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Clerkenwell Sessions—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY.Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years

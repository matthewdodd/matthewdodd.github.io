EDWARD HEALEY. I keep a public-house in Rosemary-lane, and am a customer to Rand and Abbott. The prisoner was in their service, and has sold me goods for them. In October last I owed the house between 4l. and 5l.; he called upon me to collect; he said his employers told him to keep the account short. He told me to pay a man who was with him 30s., and he would call again in a few days for 50s., and give me a receipt for the whole. I paid the man 30s.; he afterwards called, and I paid him 50s.; he gave me a receipt for the whole.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He delivered the goods in the name of Rand and Abbott. I paid the man the money in his presence. I paid him some shillings - I believe it was all in silver.

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Rand and Abbott. The prisoner was their dray clerk-his business was to attend the dray, and collect money. He never accounted for 30s. received in October from Healey, which he ought to have done; he kept a book which I have - I turn to October, there is no entry of it. He used to account to me every night for what he received.
Cross-examined. I believe he used to push the trade, and was to have an advantage.

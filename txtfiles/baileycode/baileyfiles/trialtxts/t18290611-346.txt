            . I am a chair-maker
. On the 23d of May the prisoner came up to me in Little Moorfields


, between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock at night - I had a little talk with her, and then missed my money; she ran off to Short-street - two females there came up, and spoke to her; she threw down the two half-crowns - I am sure her hand had been in my pocket; I had three half-crowns, one shilling, and twopence.

            . I am a watchman. I saw something I thought was not proper - I hid my light, and saw some money fall from the prisoner; I crossed over, and took her - the prosecutor picked up the money; he appeared sober.
JOHN PEACOCK. The prisoner was given into my charge. I received the two half-crowns and the penny; I found on the prisoner 1s. 6d. - she claimed 6d. of it, and it was returned; the shilling the prosecutor claimed - the prisoner then sat down in a chair; it was said there was no doubt she had another half-crown - I went to search her, when we heard a half-crown drop close to her chair.
Prisoner's Defence. He gave me 6d., and wanted to force me down the alley - I said I would spend it in drink, - he followed me, and wanted his money back; I would not give it - he then threw down his money in the road, and I was taken to the watch-house.

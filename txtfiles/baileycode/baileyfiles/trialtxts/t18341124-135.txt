MARY BOND
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of October, 5 shillings; 1 shawl, value 6d.; and 1 tobacco-box, value 3d.; the property of 



John Boyce.






ELIZABETH NEALE
. I have lived with John Boyce for twelve months. On the 18th of October, he and I were at the Bull, in Kingsland Road—the prisoner came in—I had not known her before, but Boyce had—she said to him, "Jack, I wish you would give me half a pint of beer, for I am in distress, and I have just been to the pump to get some water"—he said, "Half a pint is not much," and gave her a pint—I then asked her to go home to our lodging in Spitalfields, and have some refreshment—she went with us, and I took in a pot of beer for supper—Boyce and I laid down on the bed about one o'clock, leaving her in the room—he gave her his tobacco-box to take some, as she smoked—I had 5s. or 6s. in my hand when I laid down—I awoke about three o'clock—the prisoner was then gone, and I missed the money and my shawl which had been on the back of a chair—it was on Saturday night she went home with us, and on Monday we gave information, and she was taken with my shawl on her.





JOHN BOYCE
. I live with this witness. I have known the prisoner upwards of three years—she lived with a young man whom I knew—she came to the public-house, and said she was in distress—I gave her some beer, and she went home with us—Neale had 5s. or 6s. of mine in her hand—I gave the prisoner my box to take some tobacco, but not to keep—when we awoke, the box, money, and shawl, and the prisoner were gone.





JOSEPH FRY
. I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner on Monday—the witness had taken the shawl from her—the money and box have not been found.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

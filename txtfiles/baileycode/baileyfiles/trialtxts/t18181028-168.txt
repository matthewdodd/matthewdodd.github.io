JOHN PHILLIPS. I am the prosecutor's servant. I took the prisoner driving our truck at the top of Burr-street, about three hundred yards from my master's house. I had not missed it two minutes; he had been watching me in the cellar for three hours. I am certain it is my master's. The prisoner had worked for my master eight years ago.
Prisoner's Defence. A sailor employed me to carry his chest, I went to borrow the prosecutor's truck; nobody being at home, I took the liberty of taking it.

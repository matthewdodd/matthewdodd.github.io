             ; I went down stairs, and left my watch, hanging in my room, and returned home in half an hour. As soon as I entered my room I missed it, and was told the prisoner had been there. I went out to look for him, and found him the same night, and taxed him with being in my room ; he swore he had not. I told him I had lost my watch, he said he was very sorry; I took him up, searched him, but found not the watch.

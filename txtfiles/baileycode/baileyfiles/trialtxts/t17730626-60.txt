            . I am nephew to Mr. Winning: on the 2d of May, going through the hospital square, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner running and stopped him; I saw him drop a blue and white hankerchief; it was delivered to the constable. (The constable produced the handkerchief, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming home from Mile End; these gentlemen were coming one way, I was running the other; they cried stop thief; the gentleman laid hold of me, and asked if I had a handkerchief; I said no; they said that I dropped it; it was twenty yards from me; there was a little boy running, but I did not take any notice of him.

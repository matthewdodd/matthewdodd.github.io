JAMES SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

Thomas Riley.






THOMAS RILEY
. I live in George-yard, Drury-lane, and am in the ser-vice of Mr. Abbott. I boarded the prisoner from the 26th till the 28th of May—he left me, and I found him on the 29th at a livery stable in the Strand—I gave him in charge for obtaining money under false pretences—He was searched, and a duplicate found on him, which led me to Mr. Flem-ing's where I found this handkerchief, which is mine, and corresponds with the duplicate.





THOMAS DRISKILL
. I am shopman to Mr. Fleming. I took in this handkerchief in pawn, and gave this duplicate for it—I cannot tell who I took it of.






JOSEPH PERKINS
 (police-constable F 97.) I took the prisoner, and found this duplicate on him.

Prisoner. I bought this handkerchief twelve months ago at Brighton.





THOMAS RILEY

re-examined. I have had it more than two years—I have no doubt about its being mine.





ELIZABETH RILEY
. I am the prosecutor's wife—I know this handkerchief is my husband's—the corner of it I fringed out myself, and swear it is his.




GUILTY
. Aged 41.—


Transported for Seven Years.

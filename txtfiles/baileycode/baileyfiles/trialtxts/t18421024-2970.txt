THOMAS ROBINSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of August, 2 sovereigns, the monies of 



Thomas Cherry.—2nd COUNT, stating them to be the monies of 



Ann Anderson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS CHERRY
. I live in Golden-lane. On the 20th of August I gave two sovereigns to Ann Anderson to get change—she went out, returned, and gave me some information.





ANN ANDERSON
. I am servant to Mr. Cherry. On the 20th of August he gave me two sovereigns to get change—I went out with them in my hand, and met the prisoner in Golden-lane—I have seen him before—he asked where I was going—I told him to get change for two soveregns for my master—I left him, and went up the lane—he met me again, and said, "Have you got change?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Give them to me, I will get change for them"—I gave them to him—he went into a public-house—I waited a little on one side of the door—he did not come out with the change—I then went inside the house, but I could not find him—he was gone—there was another door to the public-house, at the back—I went home, and told my master—I saw him again, and went in search of a policeman—when I returned the prisoner was gone—he was taken afterwards.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-sergeant G 20.) I took the prisoner at his lodging, in Gloucester-buildings, St. Luke's—I told him it was for stealing two sovereigns from a girl named Anderson—he said he knew no such girl—on the way to the station he said, "Why did you not take young Murray as well as me, he had part of the money?"—I said, "Who gave it him?"—he said, "I did."

Prisoner's Defence. I do not know the girl; I never saw her nor the sovereigns.





JAMES HAYWARD
 (police-constable G 212.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

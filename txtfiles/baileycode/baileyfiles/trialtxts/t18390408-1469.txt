GUILTY
. * Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.





ELIZABETH GOLDING
. I live nearly opposite Mr. Woollacot in Mint-street, Borough. I saw the two prisoners there on the 10th of April, about a quarter before ten o'clock at night—they went into the shop—I saw Bums give a snatch, and the boots fell down—they came out, and Burns returned, and took the boots—they went on towards St. George's church.





WILLIAM HOWLETT
. I am in the service of John Christopher Woollacot and another. I was told of this, and missed a pair of half-boots—I went out and pursued Burns, who had got the boots on him.





WILLIAM HUMPHREYS
. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner in company near the window, peeping and looking in several times—I saw Burns snatch the boots.

Tilley's Defence. I had got 100 yards from the place before the robbery was committed, and then Bums ran up to me, and said, "Here they are"—I know nothing about the robbery.

TILLEY—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.—



Confined Three Months.

Before Mr. Justice Coltman.

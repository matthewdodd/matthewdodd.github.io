            . I live in Finch-lane. On the 11th of June, I owed Mrs. Norberry, 5 l. 17 s. 4 d. The prisoner came on the 10th or 11th. I know he had lived with the prosecutrix; he asked for 15 s. on her account as she wanted to make up a bill, and was short of silver. I gave it him; he asked at first for 10 s. or 15 s. I gave him 10 s. He then said 15 s. if I pleased.

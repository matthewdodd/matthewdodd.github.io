            . I live in Wardour-street, Soho



, and am an upholsterer
; John Macdonald was in my service. I missed all these articles; I have only found ten yards of carpetting: on the 8th of December I missed the brass fender and a coal-scuttle; I saw John Macdonald had a new pair of trousers and a waistcoat - I accused him of taking the things which I missed, and he strongly denied it; I asked how he got the wasitcoat and trousers - he said his mother took them out of pawn for him: I then went to the other prisoner's house, who is his mother, and there saw my carpeting lying down in the place, but she was not at home - I knew the carpeting to be mine; there were about four yards and three-quarters in one piece, and two yards and a half in another - they were different patterns; one was cut from a piece and the other the breadth from a whole carpet: the breadth had been cut in two and joined, so as to make a square piece - I came home, and said to John, "How could you send me to your mother's, for I have found my property there?" he said if I would forgive him he would tell me the truth what he had robbed me of; I said I would not make any promise of the kind, as he had strongly denied things that I had accused him of before - I sent my servant for an officer, who came, and took him; he said, when the officer came, that the fire-irons were in pawn for 8s., at Mr. How's, in Broad-street, St. Giles' - I went there, and the pawnbroker took the trouble to look over his book, but they were not there; his shopman then said that his mother had been there - the irons were not found there, but the officer got them.

            . You said if I confessed you would forgive me, and when I confessed he sent for a constable. A. No; I said if he confessed where a pair of trousers and waistcoat were, which I had lost, I would forgive him, but he would not till the officer came, and then he confessed; he had been in my service about three months.

            . On the night of the 9th of January I was sent for to take the male prisoner; Mrs. Joseph said something to me, and then the prosecutor came in, and said he had been robbed - I said, "Bring him up," and as they were coming in at the door I heard Mr. Joseph say, "Mind I make no promise;" I took the prisoner, and searched him - I asked him were the articles were; he said he took the fire-irons, and gave them to a woman outside the door of Mr. How's - she pawned them, and he gave her a shilling; he said he had sold the waistcoat and trousers for 8s. - the carpet he took to his mother's; I went to his mother's the next morning, and found the carpet - I then went to where his mother was nursing and asked her where the fireirons were - she said she sold them to a young man named Glass, for 1l.; we went to Glass' - we then went to his sister's, in Liquorpond-street, and there we got them; the female prisoner was with me - she said she wanted the fire-irons that were sold by

            . I bought these fire-irons of 
               
                  Jane 
                  Macdonald
               



             - she had been nursing my mother seven weeks previous to her death; she came to me one evening, and said she had a set of fire-irons to dispose of for a person in great distress, and wanted 1l. 5s. for them; I said I could not afford it at that time, but if she would come again I would buy them - she came again, and I offered her 1l. for them; she said she thought that would not do, but she came again in a day or two, and I gave her a sovereign - I offered her a shilling for her trouble, which she refused: Gook came to me - I took him to my sister's, and there delivered them up to him on the 5th of December.

             re-examined. I missed the fireirons about six weeks before this date, and the carpeting about a fortnight before; I can swear to these fire-irons by handling them, and having so many sets of them - I know the pattern, and had missed them; I mentioned them to the prisoner, and he said, "You are always accusing me; "I said, "I have a right to accuse you, for I never lost any thing before you came, and am continually missing things now" - I said I had more fire-irons than I had then in my shop; he said, "You don't know what you have got, and you think you have got thieves about you;" I had given him warning to quit me a fortnight before the 8th of January, in consequence of the trousers and the waistcoat; I found out the carpeting a fortnight before - when the officer came, I said, "You rascal, you have robbed me of carpeting, and it is up at your mother's house;" he said, "I have robbed you of nothing but the carpeting, and I hope you will forgive me" - I am sure he said that.
Prisoner JOHN MACDONALD. Q. When you counted the carpet there were five breadths, and there are five breadths there now? A. No - if that were so, how could this breadth be here? this quntity is deficient.
JOHN MACDONALD'S Defence. My mother is innocent of the charge, not knowing but that the things were come honestly by.

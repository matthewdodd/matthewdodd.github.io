                  , from his person

MATTHEW BAINBRIDGE. I am supervisor of the Excise
, and live at Liverpool, On the 4th of November, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopgate-street


, near the end of Angel-alley - I had my watch in my fob; a person passed off the curb-stone close before me - I gave way for him; he stepped before me; another came, and walked past me into the alley. Five or six persons came behind me and on my left, surrounded me, and pressed me against the wall. The prisoner came directly in front of me-my watch was at that instant taken from my fob. I do not know who took it. At that moment I saw something glitter in the prisoner's left hand, which he stretched out to a person, which, I believe, was the same that had followed me - He was on the right-hand of me. I immediately seized the prisoner, sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. I am sure it was in his hand that I saw something glitter, and he handed it to his companion. As soon as I seized him the others dispersed very quietly. The person who received it from him ran away.
Cross-examined. He was not pushed in front of me.
SAMUEL SHEPPARD. I took the prisoner in charge. He said, he only came up to ask the prosecutor what was the matter.
Prisoner's Defence. Three men shoved me against the gentleman.

JOHN HORNE
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.






THOMAS HOLMAN
. I manage the business of Mr. Alaric Alexander Watts, of the "United Service Gazette"—the prisoner was there as errand-boy, and occasionally to receive money when I was absent—he should pay money over to me immediately on my arriving at the office, but on this occasion I was confined to my bed by illness, and then he should have brought it to me at the end of the week—he never brought me any from Mr. Clayton, or Mr. Cooper—he absconded during the night of the 1st of

November, taking with him the balance of money that he had received daring the week—these sums were entered in a memorandum-book by him, but were never paid.





JOSEPH CLAYTON
. I am a news-agent. I have a confused recollection of having paid the prisoner some money, but I cannot positively swear to him.





JOSEPH COOPER
. I paid the prisoner 5s. on Friday, the 1st of November, for advertising, for which he gave me this receipt, signed by himself—(read)—"United Service Gazette. Thames Tunnel, 1 insertion, 5s. Received, F. H. Nov. 1,—39."

Prisoner. I am very sorry for what has occurred.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

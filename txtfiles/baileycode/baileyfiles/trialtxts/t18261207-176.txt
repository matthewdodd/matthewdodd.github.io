            . I am a constable. On the 6th of November I saw the prisoners in Oxford-street, and watched them down Regent-street into Glasshouse-street


 - they stood at the prosecutor's window some time - they went away, returned, and I saw Dowsett take something, and give it to Barry, who put it into his apron; they both ran towards me, and I secured them, and pushed them into a shop - Barry dropped this cotton from his apron - I took it up, and put them into the watch-house - he took it from under the door.

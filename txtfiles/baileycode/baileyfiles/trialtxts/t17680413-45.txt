            . On Tuesday last I was coming along Thames-street, about two o'clock in the day, the two lads at the bar followed me some time; when I got near Billingsgate


, I found a hand at my pocket; I looked round and saw Field have my handkerchief in his hand, he gave it to the other prisoner, who put it behind his coat; I asked him what he had there; he said nothing; I took it from him, he said he h ad just picked it up; I had hold of him, the other ran down a gateway; I called to a person who secured him.
Field's defence.
I was standing by the water-side, looking at a ship, when a man came and took hold of me.
Evans's defence.
This gentleman asked me if I had his handkerchief; I saw it lie, and took it up and gave it him.
To Evans's character.
Sarah Allen. Evans's father and mother keeps a public-house, I never knew him dishonest.

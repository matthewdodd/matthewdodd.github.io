                        Humphrey 
                        Wych
                     




. Against whom
Wych gave Evidence that he lost such goods as are charged in the Indictment, and found them in the Custody of the Prisoner, and that the value was 7 s. And one Bayley deposed, that being a neighbour of Mr. Wych, and sitting in his Shop, he saw two Women and a Man, standing at Wych his door, first one woman went in, then both, and went away, and the man went in, and coming out with something under his Coat, he went and follow'd him, telling him what he had was not his own, and called to the man of the house, who coming out owned the things.
The Prisoner said he found them at the door; but the Constable upon his Oath testifi'd that he confessed at his taking, that he had them out of the Drawer. The Court left it to the Jury, who after a little recess being agreed of their Verdict concerning these Prisoners, brought it in thus.
That John Spittle, is 


               guilty to the value of 8 s.

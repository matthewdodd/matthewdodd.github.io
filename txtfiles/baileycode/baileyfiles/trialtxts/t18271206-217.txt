            . I am warehouseman to James Morrison and Co., silk-mercers
, of Fore-street, Cripplegate


; the prisoner, who is in the employ of Mr. Bateman, a gasworker, came to our premises on the 4th of December, he went into a cellar which we keep as a warehouse; knowing he had no business there at that time, I ran by another staircase into the same cellar; I stood about thirty feet from him, and saw him put something into a basket- he covered it over with paper, looked about him, and went up again, by the same stairs; he went across the warehouse and into the shop; when he got near the door I collared him, and asked what he had got; he threw down the basket and struggled, but I held him and gave him in charge; I then examined the basket, and found this piece of striped cotton, which is my employers'; it is marked, and I know the pattern.

            . I am a cooper. On the 17th of this instant, I saw the prisoner come down stairs out of the warehouses belonging to the Crown, in Thames-street


, joining to the Custom-house. I suspected him. I followed him. He seeing me follow him set a running. I ran after and stopped him. I took him to a house in Seething-lane, and delivered him into the hands of Mr. Goodson, one of the ward constables. He refused being searched, till the constable shewed his authority: then he said, he would take the sugar out of his pocket himself. Upon which he did, out of a large pair of trowsers; there was 25 pounds of it, I saw it weighed.
Q. What goods are there in the warehouses where he came down from?
Beldon. There are sugars. The next day he owned before the Alderman he took it out of a hogshead of sugar, and I observed a hogshead had the head beat in. The sugar was the property of his Majesty. There are no other goods there but what belong to him.

             confirmed the account Mr. Beldon had given.
Prisoner's defence.
I met a man; he carried me into a house, and gave me this sugar to put into my pocket.

THOMAS GEORGE PIGRAM. I keep the Red Lion public-house, at Hillingdon




. On the 12th of October, at half-past six o'clock, my great coat hung in the passage; my servant said it was gone - I had seen it safe the night before. I pursued the way she told me, and met my man with it and the prisoner in custody - he was a stranger.

            . I live with Pigram. About half-past six o'clock a boy came in and asked for a loaf - I said I had none; he then asked for water, and when I came in I saw the prisoner running out with the coat - I sent the ostler after him.

            . I am the ostler. Butler sent me in pursuit of the prisoner, who had the coat on his arm; I called to two men in a cart by the road; he then dropped the coat, and they took him, but he got from them. I gave it to a man to hold while I secured him.

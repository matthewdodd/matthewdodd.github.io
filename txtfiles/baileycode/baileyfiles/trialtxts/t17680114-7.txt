            . I am a watchmaker
, and live in Clerkenwell court. On the first of December I carried a dozen silver watches packed up in a small box, to the Swan and Two Necks in Lad-lane, and delivered them to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Parks 
               



             the bookkeeper, directed to 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Cooley 
               



            , at Leeds, according to an order I had received.
Q. Did you ever see any of them afterwards?
Storer. I saw ten of them on the 30th of December, at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's.
Q. Who did you look upon to be accountable for them?
Storer. I looked upon it that the carrier was answerable to Mr. Cooley for them.

            . I am the book-keeper; I received a parcel of watches of Mr. Storer and book'd them, and delivered them to the waggoner, and saw him pack them up in his hamper; Stamp was acquainted with one of my servants, he was there near the hamper at the time; I received a letter from the waggoner on the Wednesday, that the small box which I gave him such a charge about was gone, and the hamper cut open; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and had the parcel advertised; it cost me 3 or 4 l. in advertising; on the 27th or 28th of December I received a letter from one of Sir John's clerks, acquainting me that the two prisoners were stopt in offering some of the watches; I went and was at the examination of the prisoners; Gregory pulled this watch out of his pocket, and told Sir John that was one of the watches that Stamp had given him to dispose of, and told where seven more of them were; we went by his direction and found them; Stamp said he found the watches between the Swan and Two Necks and Islington.

            . The two prisoners came to my door in Rosemary-lane, I am a salesman; they wanted me to buy a pair of plated buckles; then Gregory said he had a watch to sell, and said he had no money; he asked two guineas and a half for it; we agreed for 25 s. and a pair of plated buckles; I said I would go and get change; I went over the way to Mr. Murray's, who came with me, and we secured them both, and took them before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and they were committed to New Prison; (the watch produced and deposed to by Mr. Storer.)

            . I am a porter at the inn; I went a little way from the stones end with the waggon; I took the whip, and drove on to Islington; going I think along Aldersgate-street, I saw Stamp come out of the waggon, he went out with me from the inn; he was out of work, and he was going with me to Islington.
Q. Did you see him get into the waggon?
Bunce. No, I did not; we went in at the Three Hats at Islington, and called for some beer, and sat there till the waggoner came, then we went back. The waggoner had a cadet that went forward with the waggon; Stamp and I came home to the Swan and Two Necks together.
Q. Are you still in your place?
Bunce. I am.

            . We took the two prisoners in a coach to Justice Fielding's; Mr. Marsden said he would have them searched; I took another watch out of the tail of Stamp's shirt, and another from Gregory; (the two produced and deposed to;) then Gregory said if we would go along with him, he would shew us where the other seven were buried; we went with him, and found them buried in an old hat, under ground, in Feather-bed-row, in Barnaby-street; (the seven watches produced and deposed to.)
Stamp's defence.
I picked these watches up in an old hat, as I was returning from Islington.
Gregory's defence.
The watch that I had of Stamp, he said he found them; when I found I was got into a hobble, I told the truth.

            . I live at the Wheat-Sheaf, on the back of the King's palace, near the King's road


. On the 4th of August we were very full of company, when one of Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's man brought this spoon (produced and deposed to) to me. On the 5th, I shewed him several more with the same arms on them; then he told me the women were in Covent-Garden round-house. I went with him there, and saw the two prisoners. They were taken before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , where the spoon was produced, and they owned they stole it. I am sure I saw both the prisoners at my house the day it was lost.
Thomas Hutchins. I am a pawnbroker. Martha Meader came and asked me six shillings upon this spoon, and said she brought it from a person that kept a cook's shop in Piccadilly. Upon my examining her, she said the other prisoner brought it her to pledge. She was waiting at the door. I went out and brought her in. I took them before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and delivered the spoon to one of the men to go to find out where they had it. When they came to the round-house, they told Sir John's men where they had it.
Meader's Defence.

             delivered the spoon to me, and desired me to go and pawn it.

GEORGE POTTS. I am a sailor
 on board the Earl of Talbot, of London. On the 28th of October she was in the river, off the Hermitage-stairs


; the prisoner was a stranger, but had been on board about ten days, assisting the men to discharge a cargo of bark and timber; he asked me that day if I would let him lay in the cabin - I had the care of the vessel, and gave him leave: I kept my clothes in master's state-room, which is near the cabin: next morning I saw the cabin lamp laying by the windlass - I then missed my clothes from my chest. The prisoner was then gone - I did not see him again for about sixteen days.

HENRY WILLIAMS,



 RICHARD HARRIS
, and 



JOHN MORRIS
, were indicted 

for stealing, on the 
29th of December, 2 sheets, value 10s., the goods of 



John Sanders.






JAMES SANDERS
. I live in Harwood-street, Hampstead-read. I lost these sheets on the 29th of December, from the middle of my garden, where they were hanging up to dry—it is fenced round—these are the sheets—they have my writing on them.





JAMES JOHNSTON
. I am a superintendent of police. On the afternoon of the 29th of December, I entered the Liverpool-road—I saw the three prisoners standing on the left hand side of the street—two of them looked down the street, and Williams had these sheets wrapped up in this cotton print—one of them, who I believe was Harris, gave the signal, "All is clear," or "all is right"—Morrison was then looking down the street—immediately Williams ran across the road to Mr. Drew's, the pawnbroker—

Harris and Morris went on towards the turnpike—I followed them—I saw a policeman near the gate—I beckoned him, and when he came towards me, Harris and Morris ran in different directions—I followed Harris, and took him in White Conduit-street—I then returned to Mr. Drew's—I seized Williams there, with the same bundle that he took in—this is it—Morris was taken yesterday morning—I am sure he is the man.





GEORGE CLARKSON
. I am in the service of Mr. Drew, a pawnbroker. Williams brought these things to pawn on Friday.

Williams's Defence. I was in a public-house, and a man said he would give me 6d. to take these things to pawn—I gave Morris 1d. to carry them.

EMMA MILLS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of December, 9 1/4 yds. of woollen cloth, value 8l., the goods of 




Thomas William Bigg.






THOMAS WILLIAM BIGG
. I am a tailor, and live in Duke-street, Smithfield. I had some cloth on the counter in my shop on the 7th of December—I was out myself at the time it was taken, but I missed it in the evening—this now produced is the cloth—it has my mark on it.





HENRY JORDAN
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 7th of December, about a quarter-past five o'clock, I was at work in the back of the shop, and heard something slide along the counter—I lifted up my head and saw the prisoner putting a roll of cloth under her cloak—I hallooed out—she ran out, I followed her and stopped her—she let this cloth fall on the ground—I am sure the prisoner dropped the cloth—I had not lost sight of her—a man picked it up and brought it into the shop—it is my master's, and the one I had seen safe in the shop about ten minutes before.

Prisoner. You never spoke to me till you asked what I had got under my cloak. Witness. Yes, I asked you what you were doing in the shop.





WILLIAM EDWARD MULLINS
. I saw the prisoner that day—I was close to her when she dropped the cloth from under her cloak at her feet—I carried it into the shop.

Prisoner. This gentleman came by and asked the prosecutor what I had taken—he said he did not know, and then this man picked up the cloth which laid down by me—he did not see me drop it.





GEORGE HAM
 (City police-constable, No 275.) I was coming out of Bartholomew-close—I saw the cloth drop from under the prisoner's cloak.

Prisoner. A man ran quickly past me, and I heard something drop at my feet—I looked, and there rested this piece of cloth—the officer came up and the other man, and as I moved away the cloth fell from my leg on the ground.

Transported for Seven Years.

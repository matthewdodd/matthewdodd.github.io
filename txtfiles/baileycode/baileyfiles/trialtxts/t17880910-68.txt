I went to sleep in the rank of coaches in Ratcliff-highway; I am a watering-man
 there; it was past eleven at night; when I awoke I missed my hat, my buckles, and 10 s. 6 d. out of my pocket; I went indoors to my master's house, and telling my story, in came the prisoner with a hat tied up in a bit of a handkerchief, which was mine, and the buckles were taken out of his waistcoat-pocket, and the hat-band and buckle of the hat, and 8 s. 2 d. in money.

Prisoner. I bought the things of a young man, who said he had not a copper of money; and I went into this house to have a glass of gin.

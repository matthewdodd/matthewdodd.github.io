               pleaded GUILTY
            .
MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.
SIR JOHN GIBBONS, BART. I live at Stanwell, in Middlesex. I have an enclosed piece of ground, called Stanwell-park


. On the night of the 5th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, my daughter gave an alarm that poachers were in my ground; I got up, and went down stairs - my son and a footman had gone out before me with Turner and Woolford; another man afterwards joined them; there were six of us in all - I met the poachers on the bank of an aqueduct in Stanwell-park; there were seven or eight of them who had guns and bludgeons; every man was armed, as far as I could see - I met them, and my men were following them; I went into the midst of them, and seized one with a gun in his hand - he struck me with his gun, and others came to his assistance; I received bruises on my arm and on my head, which have but just gone off - the man and myself fell down together; my hat had been previously knocked off - while I was on the ground I heard the words,"D-n it, it must be done;" it was not said in a very savage way, and at that moment a blow was struck at me with a bludgeon, which I think must have killed me, had it not just missed me; it grazed my head - after some struggling I and the man I had hold of (one of the poachers) were up together, and at that moment one of my men seized him, and he was down again; I think it was the same man - there was a considerable scuffle with my own men and the poachers; I thought the one, who was down, was secure, and said "Keep him in custody, make sure of him;" the other poachers ran away, but quickly returned and rescued that man - they were pursued, but got away; there were arms levelled in all ways, but I did not see any thing done with them; I heard no more till some of them were in custody - Pond was, I believe, the first who was taken, and confessed as he has now; Carrod said he had been of the party, and that it was the first time - White pleaded for mercy, and said he had a wife and children, but he did not deny the fact; there are game in that park.

            . I am a labourer, and live at Stanwell. I was in Stanwell-park on the night of the 5th of January; when I first saw the men they were hailed by the footman and gardener; as they were coming out of the wood they said, "Stand off, for our guns are loaded"- five of them had guns; I saw Sir John Gibbons down with one of the party, and a gun was levelled at him, a trigger was pulled, and fire struck; there was a flash not more than three yards from him, and it was levelled at him; I saw all the prisoners at the bar there - there were eight or nine persons there.
COURT. Q.Have you any doubt that they were there for the purpose of destroying game? A. No.
CHARLES COODREE. I am a patrol. I assisted in taking Pond into custody, and the next morning we took the other two; White asked whether we had gone after any of the people down at Datchet; we said No - he then asked whether we had Carrod; we said No - he said he would go and show us his house; I had not told him what I took him for - while he stood in the street with my partner he said five of the others were to be found at Datchet; Carrod said but very little - he put on his shoes and stockings, and said he hoped he should not go to Clerkenwell; they asked if we had seen any of those who were with them, and who lived at Datchet; we said No.
Carrod. No. one of the witnesses can say they saw me with a gun or a stick.

JOSEPH JEFFERSON
. I am servant to Mr. Fox. Last Wednesday afternoon I saw Catherine Brown put down two milk-cans, and leave them—I saw the prisoner go to them with some cans in her hand, and she poured some milk from Brown's cans into her own, and then she went down Belgrave-place—I did not see her take any cans—I saw her take the milk.





CATHERINE BROWN
. I am servant to Mr. Charles Wilkinson, of Chapel-street, a milkman. I left my cans at the corner of Eaton-place, on the 19th of June—I left them four or five minutes—I missed ten quarts of milk, and three cans, which had been hooked to the large cans—I saw the prisoner with the cans, and she dropped them out of her hand—she had about three pints then.

Prisoner. This woman has been two years living with my husband, it is all through spite. Witness. I am married, and living with my husband—I never knew the prisoner's husband.





SAMUEL BALL
. I am an officer. The prisoner was given in my charge—she denied that she had taken the witness's milk and cans, but said she would make her a recompence—the prisoner had three other cans with her—I know Brown's husband, he is a marble polisher, a respectable man.

Owen Plumstead. I was robb'd in Hare-Street in Brick-Lane


 ; but I don't know by whom, for I was got drunk.


                  David 
                  Wood 
               



            . I was lock'd out o'Saturday Night, I met the Prisoners in Hare-Street. They ask'd me to take a Walk, and when I had gone a little Way, 
               
                  Harry 
                  Defoe 
               



             pull'd out a pair of Shoes, and said, Will you buy these Davy? No, says I, and then he pull'd off his own old Shoes, and threw them away, and put the other Shoes on; soon after, we met 3 young Fellows, whom we knew, they talk'd with us a little, and bid us good Night, and the Prisoners and I turn'd up Hare-Street again; says 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Defoe 
               



            , Here's a Man asleep, let's see if he has got any Money. And then D'angre put his Hand in the Man's Pocket and took out 3 d. I saw no more, and this was between 1 and 2 in the Morning; I speak nothing but the Truth before God Almighty. Then we went to drink a Dram, and I left 'em in George-Street.


                  Philip 
                  Morean 
               



            , 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Mason 
               



            , and 
               
                  James 
                  Mae 
               



            . As we were going along Hare-Street between 1 and 2 in the Morning, 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Defoe 
               



             pass'd us, look'd us in the Face, and went forward; he knew us all, a little way farther, a Man was lying drunk in the Street. Daniel stopp'd when he came to this Man, and cry'd, Hey! God darm ye! what do you I where for? He had hardly spoke, when 2 Men on the other side of the Way, cry'd, Hip! and he went over to 'em. We went to the drunken Man to see if we knew him, but we did not. He then had on his Hat and Wig, and his Shoes too. to the best of our Remembrance, but we will not be positive. We went a-cross the Way to see who they were that hip'd to Daniel, we knew them all four; they were the 3 Prisoners, and 
               
                  David 
                  Wood 
               



            . They began to pick a Quarrel with us, upon which we left 'em, but suspecting that they had, some design upon the drunken Man, we stood at a little Distance and watch'd 'em, we saw 'em all go to him, and rifle him, and then go off. When they were gone, we went and raised him up, and waked him; his Hat, and Wig, and Shoes were taken away, and no Body had been near him but the Prisoners, and Wood, from the time we left him, till we came to him again. We ask'd him if he knew who had robb'd him? and he said, No. They are all Weaver


s in Spittle-Fields




, and the 3 Prisoners were taken about 5 o'Clock that Morning at a Brandy-Shop in Winsord-Street.
Several Witnesses, most of them Weavers, appear'd in behalf of the Prisoners, and swore they knew no harm of them before this time; and the Prosecutor being asleep, and consequently not put in fear, the Jury found them 


               Guilty of Felony only
            .

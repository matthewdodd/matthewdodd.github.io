2675. 




JANE BENNETT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of October, 4 black puddings, value 4d., the goods of 



Edward Hurcomb.






JAMES HAWKINS
. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner came to my shop on the 19th of October, at half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, and asked the price of a bit of bacon that laid in the window—I told her—she said the price did not suit her, she could not afford it—she went away, and came again in about a quarter of an hour, and asked the price of another piece of bacon—she made the same answer, that the price was too much—I observed her take a piece of pork, and put it into her lap—I took her into custody, and found on her my piece of pork and a breast of mutton, four black-puddings, some herrings, and three or four pounds of potatoes.





EDWARD HURCOMB
. On the prisoner's being taken I was sent for to Mr. Hawkins—I live about three doors from him—I saw my black-puddings, which I had noticed in the window five minutes before—I am certain they were mine.

Prisoner's Defence. I pawned my shawl for the money that I bought the bacon and potatoes with; I know nothing of the pork.




GUILTY
.* Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)


Fourth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

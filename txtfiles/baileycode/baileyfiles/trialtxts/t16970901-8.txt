                  Danzey
               



            , a little Boy
, of the Parish of Whitechappel


, was indicted for 


               taking two dozen and a half of Silver Buttons, a Pair of Shoe-Buckles, and 3 Pair of Shirt-Buckles, from 
                     
                        James 
                        Smith
                     




                  , Son of 
                     
                        William 
                        Smith
                     



                  , on the 17th of July
 last, near the Highway
            . It appeared that the Prisoner came into the Minories and tempted the little Boy into the Fields, where he cut the Buttons off his Cloaths; he was but young in Years, but a notorious Offender in such kinds, having been several times in Newgate: The Jury after all, considering the matter, found him 


               guilty of Felony, and not of the Robbery
            .

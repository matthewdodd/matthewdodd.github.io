MARY ANN KNIGHT
. I am the wife of Thomas Knight, a City policeman. We are the housekeepers at Mr. George Heiron's, 152, Leadenhall-street; he is a tailor, and rents the whole house—Mr. Heiron's shop is on the ground floor—there is a shop door, but when the shop is closed, there is a private door into the passage of the house—if a person came in at the private door of the house he would turn to the side to the shop—Mr. Heiron has also a bedroom on the third floor, where we have a kitchen and bedroom, and the rest of the house is let out in offices—on Easter Tuesday evening Mr. Heiron closed his shop from 8 o'clock to a quarter past; he was up stairs before half past—when he closes the shop he is in the habit of leaving the key under the mat at the foot of the stairs, by the shop door, for the apprentice who lives in the shop—the street door was fastened by a common lock, which could be opened from the outside by a key—my husband was coming home about ten minutes past 9, and I came down about five minutes to 9, and looked through the offices in the first floor, and about 9, as near as possible, I went to the ground floor; I had a light with me, and I was going to the street door, as I expected my husband home—the shop door and street door were both shut—I thought I heard a noise in the shop, looked for the key, found it in its usual place, and tried to open the shop door, but I could not—I put the key under the mat again, put the light on the stairs, and waited in the passage about five minutes, when the shop door was opened from inside, and a man came out loaded with what appeared to be rolls of cloth and readymade clothing—he seemed very much surprised at seeing me—I accused him of being a thief, and asked him who he was—he said, "Leave me alone;" I had got hold of his coat, and was between him and the street door—I said, "Let you alone, indeed; you are a thief!"—I still kept my hand upon him; he rested some time with the load on his head and shoulders—I hallooed

"Thief!"as loud as I could, and he threw down the bundle in the passage, and made for the street door—I tried to get at the bell, and while doing so he escaped out at the door—I ran after him on to the kerbstone, and called out "Thief!"again—all this may have occupied five or six minutes—I had no opportunity of observing the man's features, he was so loaded—I noticed his bulk, and his dress, and cap—the prisoner is the person—he was brought back by the policeman in about five minutes—I rang the bell, and Mr. Heiron came down and examined the shop, and the bundles that were left in the passage.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALFE. Q. Did you see his features at all? A. No; I know the prisoner is the person, from his height, bulk, and the cap he had on—he wore, to all appearance, the same coat that the prisoner now does—I had not been down stairs at all before I heard the noise—Mr. Heiron had left the shop about half an hour before—no one had been down in the meantime; there was no one but him and me in the house—I do not know whether the street door was shut or not—the man answered me in English, "Let me alone"—I do not know whether there are a great many foreigners in our neighbourhood; I am not out a great deal—my light, which was a dip candle, was standing four or five stairs up—a person coming from the shop, going outward, would pass the foot of the stairs—the prisoner was brought back by the policeman to oar door—I did not select him from other people.

MR. RYLAND. Q. Did you recognize him when he was brought back? A. Yes, from the appearances I have mentioned—I think the street door was shut when I came down—I think when the prisoner escaped he pulled the lock back.





HENRY KING
. I keep a coffee house in St. Mary Axe. I know Mr. Heiron's shop, it is seven doors from Gracechurch-street—on the evening of 18th April, about five minutes past 9 o'clock, I was coming past Mr. Heiron's shop, and when I got to the door a person rushed out of the premises, so close to me that I was obliged to stop back—directly after, a female came to the door, and called out "Stop thief!"—the person turned across the road, towards the East India House; I followed him, and kept a side view of him, and when he got towards the East India House he crossed the road back again, towards St. Mary Axe—he went a few steps on that side, and then crossed, and went down Lime-street—I crossed again, and went behind him, and never lost sight of him till I saw Chambers, the policeman, and gave him into custody—the prisoner is the man.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you close to the door when the man came out? A. Yes; he would have knocked against me if I had not made a sudden stop—when the woman came to the door I did not turn to look at her—I caught a side view of her—I just cast my eyes round and saw it was a female—she called out "Stop thief!"and I followed the man—there are generally a good many people about Leadenhall-street and St. Mary Axe—there was not more at that time of day than usual, it being Easter Tuesday; but there were a great many—I was not above six yards from the prisoner when he started—he crossed the road immediately, and went down the pavement on the other side—I crossed over, and kept in the road, and when he got to the extremity of the East India House he crossed again; he went about a dozen yards on that side, and then re-crossed into Lime-street; there was then no one between me and him—I did not see a person till I met the policeman—when he crossed the road to Lime-street he looked to see if any one saw him—there were no turnings from the time he started till he was taken, he crossed the road directly opposite Lime-street—when we brought him back I told the policeman he had come from one of those houses, and he rang at

the wrong one; but I did not order him—he only knew from what I told him; I told him it was either that house or the next one—there are a great many foreigners in the neighbourhood.





GEORGE TERRY
. I live at 74, Leadenhall-street, which is on the north side, the same as Mr. Heiron's, and about three minutes' walk off. On 13th April, I was going home, just about 9 o'clock, and when I got to Mr. Heiron's I heard a female's voice cry something which I did not distinguish, and I saw a man come out of Mr. Heiron's—I was about five yards off—the man came out rather quickly, not running very fast, and ran across the road towards the East India House—I should not have noticed him but for the cry—I lost sight of him; but before that I had caught a view of his side face, enough to form an opinion about him—I believe the prisoner is the man—I stayed at Mr. Heiron's door, and in five or ten minutes the prisoner was brought back—I believe he is the same man—I said at once, "That is the man"—he said, "Oh, not!"

Cross-examined. Q. Did he rush out in a great hurry? A. Not in a great hurry—I saw him for a very short time, not half a moment.





CHARLES CHAMBERS
 (City policeman 523). On Easter Tuesday evening, about 9 o'clock, I was on duty in Lime-street, about fifty yards from the entrance coming towards Leadenhall-street—I saw King, and in consequence of what he said, I took the prisoner into custody—between me and the end of Lime-street there was no one but King and the prisoner—I stopped the prisoner, and said, "You have just come out of a house in Leadenhall-street, where a female called out, 'Stop thief!'"—he said, "No, I have just come from Cannon-street"—I asked if he had any objection to go back to the house, he said, "No," and I took him back—Mr. Terry was at the door, and said, "That is him;" the prisoner did not say anything—I took him to the station, searched him, and found four skeleton keys, a door key, a latch key, a knife, some lucifers, and 7d. (produced)—I examined his coat next morning, and found there were two buttons off—I have another one here (produced) from his coat.

Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw him he was walking quietly? A. Walking fast—he went back readily—he lives in Cannon-street-road, some people call it Cannon-street—where I found him he was not coming in a direction from Cannon-street, Lime-street, is a cross-street—if a person was coming from Cannon-street-road to where I found the prisoner, be must come up the Commercial-road, Whitechapel, and up Leadenhall-street, and then turn into Lime-street.

MR. RYLAND. Q. Could he when you saw him have been coming from Cannon-street? A. He could—I was coming up Lime-street, towards Leadenhall-street—he was coming from Leadenhall-street.





JOHN ENWRIGHT
 (City-policeman, 647). I examined the prosecutor's premises, and found ten pieces of cloth rolled up in a wrapper in the passage, and several pairs of trowsers thrown about just at the doorway—I afterwards took these keys which I received from the inspector, and tried them on the street door, neither of them would open it, but one would lock it, and one of the smaller skeleton keys opened the shop door.





GEORGE HEIRON
. I am a tailor, at 152, Leadenhall-street. The ground floor is my shop, and I occasionally occupy part of the upper part—the first and second floors are let out in offices—on the night of 13th April, I shut up my shop at 20 minutes past 8 o'clock, and put the key under the mat at the bottom of the stairs—the property in the shop was all safe in its usual state then—I went up stairs, and stayed there till five minutes past nine,

when the bell rang—I came down, found Mrs. Knight in the passage, and a large bundle of cloths, and coats, and trowsers—they were my property, and were safe in the shop when I locked it up—I found the shop door open, and besides these things being in the passage, the shop had evidently been disturbed—the things that were in the passage are worth 88l. 10s.—on the following morning I found this button (the one produced) just under the shelves where the parcels had been removed from—it does not belong to me, I have not such a one in the shop—it appears similar to the one before produced—I rent the house, it is in the parish of St. Peter, Cornhill.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you lock the outside door as well as the shop? A. I shut it, but did not lock it—I was up stairs about forty minutes.
(Frederick Ruiks, 39, New-road, St. George's in the East; Frederick Leizing, 52, Church-lane, Whitechapel; and Mary Ann Enesby, 15, Cannon street-road, deposed to the prisoner's good character.)

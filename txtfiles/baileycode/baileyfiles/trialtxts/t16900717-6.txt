             The Evidence Swore, that the Prisoners came to the house in the Evening, to Enquire if the house was troubled with any Rats or Mice, but being Answered in the Negative, they went away, but on the Morrow the Coach-house was found broke open, and the Glasses taken away. The Prisoners denyed it stifly, and pretended to be in another place when the Robbery was done, and called some Evidence, but it prevailed nothing to their advantage, so William Wilson the Ratcatcher was found 

               guilty
             of Felony, but his Wife was 

               discharged

GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.






JOHN JONES
. I am assistant to Jesse Jones, a linendraper, at Uxbridge. On the 23rd Dec. we had some printed cotton on an iron rail outside the shop—this is the cotton—I saw it safe about four o'clock in the afternoon—we did not miss it till a person came in and said it was stolen.





ANDREW WAKE
. I live at Uxbridge, and am a brushmaker. On the 23rd Dec., about twenty minutes after four o'clock, I was looking out of my window—I saw Hay trying to pull down a piece of print which hung across the rail at Mr. Jones's—he could not get it off at the first pull—he came again and made another attempt—he came three or four different times, but could not get it—I then went out and met him in the market-place with some other boys—I could positively swear to him—I have known him for years—I then saw another chap go across the way and hide himself at the corner of a gateway—Harman then came up and got the print off the iron—Hay was at that time in the market-place, with other boys, which is twelve or fifteen yards from where the print was, but within sight of the place.





JOHN VAGG
 (police-constable T 141.) I took Hay—he said all he knew about it was, he lent young Harman his coat to cover it over—when Harman was taken, he had this jacket on, which Hay owned as his.

Hay. He asked me to lend him the jacket, and he was taken with the print, with my jacket on.
(Hay received a good character.)

HAY—


GUILTY
. Aged 17.—



Confined Six Months.

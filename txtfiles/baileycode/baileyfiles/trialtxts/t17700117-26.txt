            . I am wife to the prosecutor. We keep a tallow-chandler's shop
 in the Minories


. On the 16th of this instant, about seven in the evening, there was an iron half hundred weight stood within the shop to keep the wind from blowing the door to. I saw the prisoner take it up and go off with it. I called out and he was taken immediately. I knew him before, having employed him as a porter at times. The weight was lying about four yards from the door when he was taken.

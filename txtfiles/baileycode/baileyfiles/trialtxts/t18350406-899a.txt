JOHN HOWARD
 and 




GEORGE BOSWORTH
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
16th of March, 2 live tame fowls, value 2s. 6d., the property of 



Edmund Hurrill; and that Howard had been previously convicted of felony.






ALFRED BARRY
. The prosecutor's premises are at the back of the brick-fields at Dalston—on the 16th of March, at half-past two o'clock, I saw the prisoner Howard getting over the prosecutor's pales, and the other prisoner was in a hole by the side of the fence, Howard threw him some fowls—they then saw the policeman, ran away, and got into a hole, where they dropped the fowls—I got out of the garden where I was at work, and saw the cock and hen found in the hole—the prisoners were taken by the policeman—I afterwards told what I had seen—I am sure the prisoners are the boys, I knew them before.






WILLIAM MILLICHAP
 (police-sergeant N 6.) I saw the prisoners a few yards from the prosecutor's fence—they each had something bulky under their jackets—they got into a hole at a little distance; and when I took them, they had nothing—I asked them where they had put what they had had—they said they had had nothing—I went to the hole, and found this cock and hen.





EDMUND HURRILL
. I live in Graham's-place, Dalston—these are my fowls.





WILLIAM GILLETT
 (police-sergeant N 19.) I produce a certificate of Howard's previous conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness, and know he is the man who was tried.

JOHN HOWARD—


GUILTY

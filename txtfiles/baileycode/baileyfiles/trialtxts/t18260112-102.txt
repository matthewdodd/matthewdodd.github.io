, and live in Old Compton-street


. On the 15th of December the boy in the shop gave an alarm; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running; I overtook her, and desired her to come back - she felt quite alarmed, and exposed this new cloak; she said she would give it to me if I would allow her to go about her business - I brought her back; it had hung near the door, inside the shop.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see it taken? A. No. I had not seen it after nine o'clock in the morning; there were others there, but I had seen this.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . On the 19th of April, as I was going down Holborn


, I wanted my handkerchief and missed it; I had not felt any thing done to me - I had it but a few minutes before; I saw the prisoner close behind me, and the watchman had the handkerchief.
GEORGE FORDYCE. I am a watchman. At ten minutes past eleven o'clock the prosecutor walked by me with a lady, the prisoner was close behind him - I followed, and saw him draw this handkerchief out of his pocket - the prosecutor seemed to feel some one pulling at his pocket; the prisoner threw it behind him, and it fell on my foot; the prosecutor turned, and said,
"He has got my handkerchief;" I said, "No; I have it."
Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking, and was going home - I passed this watchman, and saw him pick up the handkerchief; he laid hold of me, and said he saw me take it; I am a stranger in London, and am a native of Liverpool.

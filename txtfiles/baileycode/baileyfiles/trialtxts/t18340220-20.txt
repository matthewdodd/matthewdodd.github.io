            . I am the son of 
               
                  Edward 
                  Colvill Edlin
               



             - I go to school at Mr. Freeman's, at Enfield


 - on the 18th of December I left school for the holidays, leaving behind in the box-passage this box, with a great many books in it - it was locked up safe - I have since seen the box before the Magistrate, broken open, and some of the books which I had left in it are here now.

                  PARKER
               



            . I am servant to the Rev. Mr. Freeman - Master Edlin was at school there - I saw his box in the box-passage - on the 24th of January I went to Cracknell's cow-shed, about a quarter of a mile from the school - I found this box there, some books were in it and some out - I do not know whether any of them were missing - I saw some footmarks leading from Mr. Freeman's play-ground, which appeared to be boys' feet.

                  CRACKNELL
               



            . I have a field which has a cow-shed in it - on the morning of the 24th of January, I went to my shed, and saw this box - it was open, and some books were in it and some strewed about - I put them into the box - I told Parker of it.


                  JAMES 
                  READY
               



            . I lodge with my brother, at Edmonton - I sell oranges and fruit - I was passing the Cock, near Hound's field, at Edmonton, on a Friday four or five days before I went before the Magistrate, I saw the four prisoners there - they each of them had a book in their hand- I gave three of them an orange a-piece for their books, but I cannot say which of the prisoners it was - I think I had one book of Nightingale - I told every one I met that I had the books, and gave them up to the officer.

            . He came and said he would give us an orange a-piece for them. Witness. No, they asked me to buy them.

            . I am a horse-patrol - on the 24th of January I heard of this robbery - I examined the footmarks which led into the shed from the pales of the playground - I found four books under some loose hay in the shed - I knew the prisoners, and took them on suspicion - I afterwards saw Ready in company with two other persons - I asked if they knew anybody in their line who had received some books of some body? - Ready said he had; and he went home and got these gooks - I took him to the cage, and he identified the prisoners.

            . I keep the academy - I know some of these books, which Master Edlin had had of me - the whole of them were fully worth Â£4 10s.

            . On the Sunday after the prisoners wereput into the cage - I was going to the church, and the prisoners were making a great noise - I told them, if they did not behave well, I would put the cane on them, and separate them from each other - one of them, who, I think, was Thomas James, said, he had sold a book for a tanner, and he wanted to collar the money; but that they afterwards went to the public-house and got sixpence worth of halfpence for it, and divided them - I asked them who they had sold it to - they said, to an Irishman - they were all together; and none of them denied it - I then asked what they had done with the other books - they said they had parted with them to an Irishman for an orange a-piece; and I think Nightingale said he had given one to a little boy in a black pinafore - I then asked where the other books were; and Thomas James, (I believe it was,) said, they had left them in Cracknell's cow-shed -

             said they carried the box across the field, and when they came to the fence, two of them got a stick and pushed it up to Farraway, who was on the top of the fence; but he let it fall on a stone, which broke it, and by that means they saw what was in it.

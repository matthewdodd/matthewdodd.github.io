2863. 




WILLIAM BRADLEY
 was indicted

 for forging and uttering an acquittance and receipt for 6l., with intent to defraud 



James Edward Butler.






JAMES MARTIN
. I am a silk warehouseman—the prisoner has been in my employ, but was not at the time in question—Mr. Butler owed me money—none has been handed over to me—I never gave Mr. Butler a receipt for any.





JANE BUTLER
. My husband's name is James Edward—I am a dealer in fancy trimmings—I had dealings with Mr. Martin—I owed him 6l., which I paid to the prisoner on the 18th of Aug.—he gave me this receipt—(produced.)

Prisoner. Q. How many times were you called on for the account? A. Only on Tuesday night by you—I am quite sure it was you—I saw you write that receipt.





SIMON ANRUCHY
. I am clerk to Mr. James Martin—I do not know the handwriting of this receipt—I know no person of the name of William Benson.

Prisoner's Defence. It is impossible the witness can speak to my identity, having no witness to prove it. I never was in the street since I lived with Mr. Dent, an upholsterer and draper there. I never called for the account.




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 30th of August I lost my watch out of my bedchamber. I saw it at 8 o'clock in the morning, and missed it at twelve . The Prisoner was my fellow servant

, she went away from her place that day, and did not return any more. I asked my mistress about it , and she said she knew nothing of her going . The 5th of this month she was brought to me , and said, if I would be kind, she would help me to my watch again if she could, and owned she stole it (but at first she denied it, and said, she knew nothing of it.) She carried me to one 
               
                  Ann 
                  Atkinson 
               



            , a quilter, and she confessed that she sold the watch, but did not know that it was stole.


                  Ann 
                  Atkinson 
               



            . I never saw the Prosecutor in my life.

            . When the Prisoner was before the Justice, she owned the taking the watch out of the Prosecutor's room. And 
               
                  Ann 
                  Atkinson 
               



             said that she did sell the watch for a guinea, but did not know it to be stole.

                  Rebecca 
                  Demain 
               



             said she would help the Prosecutor to his watch again; and Atkinson said to Demain, You vile woman, how can you charge me with a thing that I know nothing of? A woman came in, and said, There is the watch come to light that had the glass broke. Said she, how could you say you had not the watch when you sold it for a guinea, and had four shillings for selling it? then she fell a crying, and said, She had nailed it. Then I said, how can you deny it, when the woman says you sold it? Then Atkinson owned she sold the watch for a guinea, and that 
               
                  Rebecca 
                  Demain 
               



             said, when she gave it to her, that it was her father's.

                  Atkinson 
               



            . If I did say, that I sold the watch, I did not know what I said, for I never had a watch from her; and I hope the gentlemen will forgive me for that, and take it into consideration.


                  Rebecca 
                  Demain

            . I have known Atkinson about four months, she is a quilter, she was a very honest woman for the time I have known her.

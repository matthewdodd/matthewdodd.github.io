RALPH CHARLES PRICE
. I am a relation of Mr. Charles Price, who lives in William-street, Blackfriars. At half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th of November I was standing in the warehouse, and saw a man

whom I did not know, coming up the yard—I asked where he had been—he said, "To the stable with food for the horses"—I asked where his cart was—he said, "In the next yard"—I saw his pocket was bulky, and asked what he had got—he ran off—I chased him up and down the street—my warehouseman came out—as he was running he dropped these reins from his pocket—I picked them up, and the warehouseman caught him, took him into the yard, and sent for an officer.





THOMAS ANGLISS
. I am groom to Mr. Price. These are his reins—I had seen them safe not a quarter of an hour before they were taken—they were in the stable.





WILLIAM SAMUEL RUMSEY
. I am warehouseman to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner drop these reins—I took him.





ISAAC NOBLE
 (City police-constable No. 215.) 1 took the prisoner—he was not drunk.

Prisoner's Defence, I was drunk when I took them—I do not know whether I took them or not.

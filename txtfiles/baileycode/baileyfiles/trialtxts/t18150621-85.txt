            . In consequence of some information I received, that Mr. Wiggin was robbed, I followed the prisoner up Kingsgate-street, and overtook him; I said, my friend, a word with you; and he immediately threw down the cloth, and ran away. I continued my pursuit, and secured him, and brought him back.

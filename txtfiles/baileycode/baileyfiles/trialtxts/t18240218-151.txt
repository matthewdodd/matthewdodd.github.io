            . I am a cork cutter
, and live in Crown-street, Westminster. On the 3d of January, I secured a shed, (which I took for a warehouse,) with two padlocks, and kept the key; I heard of no robbery till about the 15th; then went and found it broken open, and three axletrees gone.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am wife of the prosecutor. We hired a stable in Holloway's yard, Horseferry-road


, and on the 3d of January, placed these goods in it. I went there on the 13th, and found the door broken, and a quantity of goods, besides these, gone.

            . I am an officer. On the 13th, at night, I stopped the prisoner in Tothill-street, with this property - he gave no account how he got it. I saw him go into an old iron shop with it; but they would not buy it.
Prisoner's Defence. I work for Mr. Holloway. A man came out of my master's yard carrying these things. I asked where he was going - he said to Mr. Turpin's, in Dartmouth-street; and when I got to the corner of Dartmouth-street, I met him again; he dropped them, and I picked them up; and asked Turpin if he knew anything of them.

1890. 




DANIEL BYRNE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of July, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Charles Thomas Up cott from his person.







CHARLES THOMAS UPCOTT
. I live in Wood-street. On the 5th of July, about ten o'clock, I was near the New Post-office in Cheapside—I was told something, and missed my handkerchief—I followed the prisoner and took him—this now produced is my handkerchief, and the one I lost.





JOHN DENNIS
. I live in Friday-street. I was near the Post-office, and saw the prisoner behind the prosecutor, with his coat in his hand—I saw him take his hand from under his coat—I told the prosecutor, and he followed him.





JAMES BRADFORD
 (City police-constable, No. 216.) I found the handkerchief in the door-way of Mr. Millard, in Newgate-street.

MR. UPCOTT
re-examined. The prisoner crossed from Cheapside to Paternoster-row, and then through Panyer-alley to Newgate-street—there is no doubt he dropped the handkerchief before the officer came up to him.




GUILTY
.** Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

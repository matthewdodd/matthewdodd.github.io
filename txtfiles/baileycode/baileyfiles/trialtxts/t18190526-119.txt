            . I am foreman to Messrs. Curling and Co., who are ship-builders



, at Poplar; the prisoner was in their employ as ship's store-keeper
. On the 27th of April, as he was leaving the yard to go to dinner, I observed something suspicious in his apron; I stopped him, and took a bolt from his pocket. I took him to Mr. Curling, who made him unload. He produced from his person about 12 lbs. of copper bolts and nails and mixed metals, I asked him what could induce him to do it? he said he wanted to obtain money to purchase a jacket. He had 24 s. a week.

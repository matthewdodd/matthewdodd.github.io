            . He is a house keeper. I only prove the property; it was very near nine in the evening when the things were lost; I lost a pair of sheets, value 4 s. a blanket, value 3 s. the property of my husband; I saw them that morning on thebed; a man's great coat, a jacket, a pair of velveteen breeches, and a shirt; they belonged to 
               
                  Joseph

             sworn.
I am a workman with the prosecutor. I came home about ten minutes before eight and fastened the door: there were two keys; one the prosecutor had, and Phillips had the other; I borrowed one to let myself in, and kept it till near nine o'clock; I got the key of Mr. Rice's son.

             sworn.
I am one of the patrols of St. James's, Clerkenwell. I met the prisoner between eight and nine, on the 9th of April, with a bundle; I asked him what he had; he said they were things of his own; I asked him where he was going with them; he said he was going to St. Giles's; he said he had a blanket, a pair of sheets, a pair of breeches, and a jacket; but there were more things which he did not mention; I bid him come into the publick-house; he said he would, but he ran away and left the bundle; he slipped down, and I took him; the bundle has been in my possession ever since; the great coat was never found; I did not search the prisoner.
(The things belonging to Mr. Rice produced, and deposed to by Mrs. Rice, and the shirt, the property of 
               
                  Joseph
                   Phillips
               



            , which she made.)

             sworn.
(Deposes to the jacket): I had it on at work all that day; I pulled it off at half past seven and hung it up on a turn-up-bedstead in the room where I sleep. (Deposes to the breeches.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I picked up this bundle at a door at Islington.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

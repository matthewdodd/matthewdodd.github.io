            . I live in Surry-square. On the 19th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was at Billingsgate


, talking to Mr. Colburn, a fish salesman, in the middle of a crowd, and thought I felt a hand in my right hand coat pocket, felt, and missed my handkerchief, which I had used just before. I turned round, and saw the prisoner drawing backward, seized him by the arm, and found it in his hat - he said nothing, and I took him to the watch-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

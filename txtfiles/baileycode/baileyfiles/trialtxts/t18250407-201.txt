JOHANNAH BRYAN. I am single. On the 30th of March, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my lodging, in Union-place, Compton-street


 - I gave her a lodging out of charity; the next day, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I missed a pair of stockings and a shirt, and then three shirts, out of a box - they were my own property. I went up stairs, and told her I had lost them - she denied having taken them. I sent for the watchman; I got some of them again that night.

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner to the watch-house on the 31st of March; I found nothing on her.

            . I was watch-house keeper. I searched her, but found nothing on her; I took her up stairs, and when I came down again I found these two stockings by the side of the chair where she had sat. On the Sunday following I saw a duplicate down the water-closet, of a shirt, pawned at Mr. Smelly's.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Smelly. These two shirts were pawned, one on the 30th of March, and one on the 31st, but I do not know by whom.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

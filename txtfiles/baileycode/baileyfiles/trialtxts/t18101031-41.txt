             - A. They are cousins. On Friday the 28th of September the parcel was taken in and booked about half past-seven in the evening. I was at the top of the warehouse, I saw a man at the bottom with a parcel under his arm; I believe it to be the prisoner at the bar; I called out to him, he made no answer, but walked away; I sent the porter after him, I saw the porter pursue him, the prisoner, dropped the parcel in the gateway I did not see him do that, and while the porter was pursuing him at the end of Maiden-lane, I also ran, crying stop thief; he ran as far as Haberdashers's-hall; there came a cart, and then be doubled and ran towards Wood-street, I crossed over and stopped him; the porter came up and assisted me in taking him to the Compter; I there changed him with taking the parcel. The porter's name is James Porter, he is a constable, he has been in possession of the parcel ever since.

            . I am a porter at the Castle Inn, and likewise a constable. On Friday evening, the 28th of September, I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse, he had this parcel under his arm, he passed me; Mr. Webster came out and desired me to follow him, the prisoner was then half way down the gateway; I got within two yards of him, and then he dropped the parcel, I pursued him, he ran up Maiden-lane, to Haberdashers-hall; a town cart coming along he turned back towards Wood-street. I never lost sight of him. Webster was in pursuit of him at the same time, he stopped him in Maiden-lane, I brought him back to the accompting house and found the parcel in possession of my fellow servant, Edward Bailey.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going that night to an acquaintance of mine in Bishopsgate-street; I heard the alarm of stop thief, unfortunately I ran as well as the rest; some man accused me of robbing in the Inn-yard. I had nothing at all about me, I went with them where they chused to take me. I am totally innocent of it.

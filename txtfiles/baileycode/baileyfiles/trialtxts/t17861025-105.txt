             sworn.
I live in Houghland-street, Tottenham-court-road; I lost a Barcelona handkerchief, on Monday, the 9th day of this month, between three and four o'clock, going up Holborn


, on the left side, near the church, I thought I felt some body at my pocket; I found nothing missing; I was not sure I had lost any thing; I buttoned up my pocket to prevent his taking it; I observed the prisoner following, but I am not sure it is the prisoner, I believe it is; I had not gone far, when I heard the cry of stop thief; and Scott held up the handkerchief, and told me my pocket was picked; it was a handkerchief of my wife's, and the only one I had of the kind; I believe it to be mine; I found I had lost one; I had the handkerchief about a week; I will not swear I had it that morning; I went into a stationer's shop, and gave my name.

             sworn.
I am engine keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn; at half past two, on Monday, the 9th, I saw the prisoner with his right-hand, take the handkerchief out of Mr. Moore's pocket; I am sure of the prisoner; I saw him throw the handkerchief away.

I was walking with my brother, and saw the prisoner pick Mr. Moore's pocket; I took him into custody; the last witness had the handkerchief.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going up Holborn, and two more young fellows just behind me, and immediately that gentleman halloo'd out, that man has picked the man's pocket; and he crossed the way immediately, and laid hold of me; says I, what do you want with me; says he, you have picked the gentleman's pocket; he picked up the handkerchief off the ground; and he said I threw it into the apple-basket, or apple-stall that was there.

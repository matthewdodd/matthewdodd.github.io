            . I am a journeyman shoe-maker
: I was out of my house about eight o'clock; I had been out about a quarter of an hour; when I returned I found both the children stripped.
- Bath. I saw the prisoner stripping the children in the porch of the church at London Wall


; she had stripped one; then I went into a house to speak to the schoolmaster; when I returned she had stripped the other; I called to a gentleman to stop her; she came back towards me and threw the bundle into the house; I took them up and have kept them ever since. (They were produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

            . I am a Policeman. I was at Ratcliffhighway, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening of the 7th of September - I saw the prisoner, and watched him to the end of my beat; I then saw him putting something into his pocket - I asked what he had there; he said a cap which he had bought at Poplar, and he had got the money by selling fish - I made inquiries, and found Mrs. Pain; the shopman saw this cap, and identified it.

            . I am in the employ of Mary Ann Pain. This cap is her property; I remember seeing it in he shop, but cannot exactly say when - we did not miss ittill I went with the officer, and recognized it; I am quite sure it had not been sold that day or the day before.

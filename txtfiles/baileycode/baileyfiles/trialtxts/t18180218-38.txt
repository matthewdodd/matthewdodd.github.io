            , ESQ. I live in Curson-street, Mayfair. On the 19th of February. between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Fleet-street, going to the Temple, nearly opposite Peel's coffee-house


 - I found somebody brushing my coat by my left pocket; I felt and found my handkerchief safe, but my pocket-book gone. The prisoner was brushing close to my pocket at the time - He pressed forward, there was a boy in his company. I seized the prisoner's left hand, and said, you have my property - He said "I have not." I kept hold of him; he opened his hand, and showed me my pocket-book, and said "Take it, don't prosecute me, I am a poor man with a large family."
GEORGE LAMBE. I am a merchant, and reside at Camberwell. I was returning from the Temple, the prosecuter charged the prisoner with having his property; I took the pocket-book from him, the prisoner said he was a poor man. He could not have picked it up.

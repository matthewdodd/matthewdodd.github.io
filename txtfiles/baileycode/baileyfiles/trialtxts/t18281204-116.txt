            . I am a watchman - I know Mr. Buckingham's house - he is a linendraper
, in Shoreditch


; about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon of the 18th of November, I saw the prisoner near his house, and he took a piece of calico from the railing at the window; he pulled at it several times, and got it away; I went and seized him with it, just as he got across the road; he was rescued from me by the assistance of two females, who held me by the waistcoat and the arm till he got away; he dropped the calico - I took it up and gave it to a person to take it to Mr. Buckingham's; I pointed him out to an officer the next morning, and he was taken.
Prisoner. He stated to my parents that another man took it off the rail. Witness. No - I never said so - I saw what I have stated.

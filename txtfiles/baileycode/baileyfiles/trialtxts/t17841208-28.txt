, my mother and me lodge in the house of

            , I lived there in November last; on the 29th of November, my mother and me went out about half past six, and staid till about half past eight; our room is on the ground floor, we left the door locked when we went out, I locked it; the people that belonged to the house, were at home up one pair of stairs, the street door was open, the windows were down when we went out, and we found the door open when we came back at half after eight; it was wide open, and the windows were half open, the lock of the door was a spring lock, and it was drawn back; we had only one window in the room, and that is in a back yard, and that was half open; there did not appear any marks of violence about it.
Court. Was there room enough for a man to get into that room? - Yes.
How high is this window from the ground in the yard? - About four feet, we found nothing in the yard, the first thing I missed was my box, I cried out my box; it was an oak box, it was found in the fields, there were four gowns in it, one linen; I had taken every thing out of my box that night, and put them in again, there were all the things mentioned in the indictment; I had left my service the night the things were taken away.
Court. Did you ever see any of your things afterwards? - Yes.
Had you ever seen the prisoners before? - Yes, they live close by where my mother lives; a pair of my stockings was found upon Kelsey's legs, at the

            , Bow-street; I know no more about it; the woman pawned some of my things, the linen gown and silk cloak.
Court. Are there any particular marks on the gown? - I had taken off the cuffs, the evening it was taken away.

             sworn.
I heard a door shut, it seemed to be below where I was going in, there was a light in the next window, I observed the prisoner Kelsey to walk very quick, he had a box on his head.
Can you positively venture to swear that the prisoner Kelsey is the man? - Yes.
Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, I thought it was something of his mother's, I did not attempt to stop him; it seemed to be a darkish box about a yard long, as near as I can guess, it was about two hours after that, I heard the first witness complaining; I live within two or three doors, and I looked out of the window, and she said, she was robbed; and I innocently said, I saw Kelsey go off with the box; I saw his face, he came in front, I made way for the person that had the light to pass me, he came up the yard where the woman lodges, it is an enclosed yard, there is no thorough-fare; I saw him not ten yards off.
Alderman Watson. Tell me child, on what day was this? - On Monday last, was a week.

             sworn.
I searched Kelsey's lodging, in a little court the back of Pye-street.
What did the prisoner Colley say? - She said, she had pawned a gown and coat, she said nothing about the lodgings, I found I pair of pockets, two gowns, three pair of sleeves, and two caps, and the remains in the fire place, of a silk gown, there appeared to have been a good many things burnt there.
Did you find any box there? - None at all, I have had the custody of these very things.
Court to Prosecutor. Look at these things.
(The gown deposed to by a bit of black silk stocking for a string, the three pair of sleeves deposed to by a black string, the two caps by being turned in.)

Prosecutor. As to the piece of silk gown, I had one of the same pattern, but I cannot swear to this piece.
Court to Maynard. At what time did you find these things at Colley's lodgings? - At half after ten, on Tuesday morning.
What did Colley say? - She said, there was a large bundle of things brought there the over night, and when I came, I found no more.
Did she live in these lodgings? - Yes, and had lived there a week.

             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker in the Ruins, near St. Margaret's, Westminster; the prisoner Colley brought a gown, and pawned it about nine at night; I am very sure she is the woman, I never saw her before, the distance from Kensington-square to my house is three miles.

I belong to Bow-street, I was at Kensington-gate, on Monday se'nnight at night, and there was information of a place being broke open: and a box of clothes stolen, and a person saw the prisoner, with the box upon his head; I pursued him, and found the two prisoners at the sign of the Bell and Fish, it was a little before ten, I brought them away to Covent Garden watch-house; the next morning they were brought before Sir Sampson Wright.
Did you examine the prisoner? - Yes.
Did you find any thing on either of them? - No.
PRISONER COLLEY's DEFENCE.
On Monday night I went to see my brother, who lives close by this girl's house, and I saw a man come out of this yard, and I saw this box stand in the middle of the road; I did not know what it contained, I asked several people if they owned it, I found it was uncomfortable to carry, and I put it down, and the lid came open, and I took the things that came out, and carried them home.
PRISONER KELSEY's DEFENCE.
A young man came to see me, and I went to the public house, and this young man asked me to pawn these things, and I went.

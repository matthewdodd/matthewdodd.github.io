JOHN GRAY
(police-sergeant C14.) On the 22nd of May, at a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I was at my own door, in New Cross-street, Leicester-square. I saw the prisoner pass me, in company with a person I knew—that was about seventy yards from the prosecutor's house—the prisoner was carrying something—I followed him, and asked him what he had got—he said, "Nothing, " and dropped these things at his feet—I took them, and said, "Where did you get them? "—he said he picked them up.





WILLIAM CRAWLEY.
I live in Oxendon-street—part of this property is mine and part my sister's—it was taken from the front parlour of my house—I do not know how a person could get it—they must have got in by a false key, or some means—the door was all safe when we found out the robbery, which was about eleven o'clock at night.





ELIZABETH CRAWLEY.
I am the prosecutor's sister. On the morning of the day of this robbery I had seen all this property safe.

WILLIAM HAMMOND. I am a servant
. About a quarter-past seven o'clock, on the 2d of March, I was in Holborn


; I had a handkerchief in my left hand coat pocket: I felt something at my pocket - I turned round and saw the prisoner close behind me - I did not see any thing in his hand - the officer pursued him to opposite Hand-court - he dropped the handkerchief in running, and the officer took it up.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner near the prosecutor - there was a crowd, at the corner of Turnstile, looking at the pictures - I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his own - I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, and told him what I had seen - the prisoner then ran across to Hand-court - I pursued, and saw him drop the handkerchief - he was not out of my sight.

             sworn.
I know I loaded a barge belonging to Mr. 
               
                  Wright
               


             the 3d of March, on board the Charming Sally, Captain Robinson, and I put her the same afternoon along side of the George and Jane, Captain 
               
                  Marshall
               


            , with intent to load her up the next morning, she was not quite loaded; I went to load her the next day, and when I came, I found coals gone out of the barge; she lay at King James's-stairs


.

                   SPATE
               



             sworn.
On the 4th of March, about three in the morning, I saw three boys in a wherry with coals, I rowed up to them, I went into the boat to see who they were, suspecting the coals were stolen, the boat was off Pelican-stairs, where there is nothing but empty craft lay; it was a common wherry.
How long had you observed them before you went on board their boat? - About ten minutes, I knew Tuckey and the other, but I could not call him by his name, they were all three in the boat together.
Did you ask them any thing respecting these coals? - I asked Tuckey whether the boat belonged to him, and he said yes; they ran away out of the boat as soon as I came in.
Court. How did they get off? - They went over the light craft.
How far was the place off where you saw the loaded wherry to the stairs? - The ship lay in the tier opposite.
Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Council. Tuckey is an apprentice
, is not he? - I believe he is.

                   ELBY
               



             sworn.
Being informed that a boat load of coals was stopped, I apprehended the prisoners.
Did any thing pass? - I said to Tuckey, you will not leave off these old tricks you are going on with; I took Tuckey, and the other prisoner, and the evidence, all out of one bed; Tuckey told me he had these coals out of a lighter, and the number he could not tell.
Was Eaton present at that time? - No.
Was the other person? - No.
Mr. Sylvester. They all knew you were a runner to one of the justices? - Yes.


                  THOMAS
                   EATON
               



             sworn.
Mr. Garrow, Council for the Prosecution. Tell the Court in your own way what you know of this boat of coals? - About twelve or one, the two prisoners and me took a sculler out of the house where we lodge, No. 48, Palmer's-street, Ratcliff-highway, and went down to New Crane-stairs, the bottom of New Gravel-lane, when we came there we found a boat adrift, we all three stepped into her, and put the sculls into her, and rowed up to Wapping-new-stairs, and finding there was no coals there, we rowed down again, and found this boat of Mr. Wright's, and stepped into her, and made the boat fast, and handed the coals out; we were rowing for shore, and seeing a wherry go past, we were dubious; we went in between some craft as they should not see us, and Mr. Spate saw us, and we all three jumped out of the boat, and he ran after us, and he said to Tuckey, what you will not leave your old tricks; we all went into a light craft and shoved her on shore; we were all aprehended the same morning about eight.
Mr. Sylvester. Was it light or dark? - It was moonlight.
Then Mr. Spate never was within five or six yards of you, was he? - He was a top of some craft strand, and we were jumped into a wherry that was under it.
PRISONER TUCKEY's DEFENCE.
We went to Deptford, and got a cast, and we saw this boat adrift, and the man came and took us.
The prisoner Tuckey called two witnesses to his character.
PRISONER GARDENER's DEFENCE.
This young man lodged in the same house as I did, and there was a merry-making, and he asked me to go along with him down to Deptford, to see his acquaintance home, and I went with him, and coming back, we got a cast over the water, and we saw this boat loaded with coals, the waterman put us into the boat, and we rowed her on shore.
Court. What are you? - I go to sea
.
Court to Elby. What is Tuckey? - I only know him for these little tricks.

Court. Can Gardener bring any body to speak for him?
Gardener. I came home from sea, and both father and mother were dead.
Tuckey. I am Tuckey's father, my Lord.
Court. I am very sorry for it.
Tuckey. I cannot help it; shew him a little lenity, my Lord.
Court. What can we do with him, Mr. Tuckey, to save you more regret? if I could put him out of the way of more mischief, and accomodate his case to your feelings, I should be very glad to do it.
Tuckey. I will send him into the country, down to my friends, my Lord, he is a young fresh boy, led away with bad people.
Court. Can you send him abroad? - Yes, I can send him to the East or West Indies.
Court. I have no objection in the world, if you will satisfy the Recorder that he shall be sent to the East or West Indies, but I will not agree to it upon any other terms but his going abroad.
Tried by the first London Jury before Mr. Baron EYRE.

 last.
The Prosecutors having lost several Quantities of Cloth, suspected the Prisoner, who was Servant to a Cloth-worker
, and frequently came to their Shop to fetch Cloth to be dress'd. They set a Man in a private place to watch, and he saw the Prisoner take 5 Yards of superfine Broad Cloth, wrapt it up in his Bundle, and carry it out, but did not let him go far before he oblig'd him to come back to the Shop, when the Goods were found upon him. He begged hard for pardon, and protected it was the first Crime that he had been Guilty of; but being strictly examined, he at last confess'd that he had taken several Parcels before that time, and sold them to - Wynn, a Piece-broker, behind St. Clement's, where they were found. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

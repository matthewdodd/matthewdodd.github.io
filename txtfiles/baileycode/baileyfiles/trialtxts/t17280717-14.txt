Moses Freeman depos'd, That the Prisoner coming to him in an humble Manner, and desiring to be employ'd in his Business of Peruke-making
, he took him in to work in his House, but as he said he came out of the Country, where his Friends were dead, and had no Character, he ordered his other Servants to have an Eye to him, but upon his seeming good Behaviour, the Prosecutor took him in to lodge in his House, which soon gave him Occasion to repent of his Credulity, for coming home on Sunday the 7th of this Instant July, about Ten at Night, the Prisoner let him in, and he perceiving something white lay in the Passage near the Shop Door, he ask'd the Prisoner what it was, he said it was nothing, but the Prosecutor going up to it, found it was a Wig Box, (which he (not suspecting any Thing) bid the Prisoner put it in the Shop, but he immediately ran away, which caused the Prosecutor to inspect further into the Matter, when he found that the Box was full of Wigs pack'd up, as if to carry off; upon which, with some Advice of a Neighbour, he went down to see if the Prisoner was not gone to the Gravesend Boats, it being about the Time of their going off, and coming to Darkhouse-Lane, he heard that he was gone off for Gravesend, and he getting a pair of Oars, pursued and overtook him at Woolwich, where they search'd him, and found a considerable Quantity of Humane Hair upon him, which appeared to be the Prosecutor's; upon which the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d.

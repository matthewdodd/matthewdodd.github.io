2184. 




THOMAS SALMON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of September, 1 coat, value 3l., the goods of 



Mortimer Ricardo.






WILLIAM HARROWSMITH
. I bought the duplicates of two coats of the prisoner—he said one of the gentlemen's servants gave him the duplicates—I am a boot-maker to the Life Guards—I was to give a sovereign for these duplicates.





DANIEL BATTON
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in John-street, West-minster. These coats were taken in by Mr. Batton, thirteen months back, but he is not able to come—this is the counter duplicate.





EDWARD TYRRELL
. I am an inspector of police. From information which I received after the prisoner was in custody, about a saddle, I went to the harracks, and they told me there had been many things stolen—I went to the pawnbroker's and found these two coats which had been stolen from the barracks—one eighteen months ago, and one three years ago—I got the duplicates from Harrowsmith.





HENRY THORN
. I am servant to Captain Mortimer Ricardo, of the 2nd Life Guards. The prisoner has been helper in the barracks and stables—this is one of Captain Ricardo's coats—I lost it three years ago, from the kitchen of the mess-room—it was pawned on the 16th of September, 1834.

Prisoners Defence. I never pawned the coats—I bought the tickets of the servants who lived with Captain Ricardo—they have left the barracks.
(Eliza Colly, of Praed-street, and Thomas Corduck gave the prisoners good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.
There was another indictment against the prisoner.

             sworn.
On the 3d of March, I was going from Bishopsgate to Guild-hall. At the end of the South-sea-house, Threadneedle-street


, a man jogged me on the left arm; at the same time I felt a pull at my right hand pocket; the prisoner was pulling my handkerchief out; I seized him directly; I saw the end of it come out of my pocket; I said he had got my handkerchief; he said he had not; I took it from his right hand; he got away from me, and ran about thirty yards; I called stop thief! some people standing in Bishopsgate-street, held up their hands, and he slackened his pace; and I collared him again, and took him to the Compter: the man who jogged me, I believe to be an accomplice, for I called to him to assist me, and he would not; and when I had taken him, the other went away in the crowd.

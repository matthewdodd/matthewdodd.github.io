GEORGE WIGHTWICK
. I am assistant to Samuel James Nichols, a draper, in Chiswell-street. On the 19th of July, about three o'clock, I missed a piece of printed cotton from inside the door—this is it, and that he had been before convicted.





RICHARD GEORGE TAYLOR
. About three o'clock on the 19th of July, I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner take a piece of print—he ran away—I followed him, and took him in Milton-street—he said he would make it right—I took him to a public-house—he put it down, and ran out, but a policeman took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Chiswell-street, and saw this at the door, I took it up and went down Milton-street—Taylor said, "Let us go in here," and he went into the tap-room.





WILLIAM GREEN
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

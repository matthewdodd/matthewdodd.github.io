WILLIAM HUGH POWELL PROSSER
. I am a wine and spirit-merchant, in Mitre-court, Milk-street. In April last the prisoner was my porter—on the 9th of April, my cellarman gave the prisoner two gallons of whiskey, to take to Mr. Clemson, in Kent-road, in twelve glass bottles—he did not return that Saturday night—he came on Monday, and said he had delivered them right—on Monday evening, when he came home, he said he wanted some bottles—I gave him some money—he went away, and never returned—he had 18s. a week.





SAMUEL LECOURT
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 9th of April, I gave the prisoner the bottles of whiskey of deliver to Mr. Clemson, and the permit—I did not see him again till the Monday—he then told me he had delivered to.

Prisoner. He was not in the place when I had them. Witness. Yes—I gave them to you myself.





EDWARD CLEMSON
. I live in James'-road, Old Kent-road. I ordered this whiskey, but did not receive it, nor did I see the prisoner at all.





BENJAMIN CATMULL
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner—he said he knew what he was taken for, and he was very sorry, that it was concerning Mr. Prosser.





TIMOTHY FISHER HODGSON
 (City police-constable No. 34) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—the prisoner is the same person.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he could not find Mr.

Clemon's house; and having fallen and broken the bottles, he did not return, fearing the prosecutors's anger.

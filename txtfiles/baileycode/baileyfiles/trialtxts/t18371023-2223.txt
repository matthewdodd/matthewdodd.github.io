THOMAS HENRY GREEN
 was again indicted

 for stealing on the 
23d of August, 7 shirts, value 3l. 15s.; 7 pairs of stockings, value 15s.; 4 handkerchiefs, value 1l. 4s.; 1 flannel waistcoat, value 4s.; and 1 pair of gloves, value Is. 6d.; the goods of 



John Wilson, from his person.






WILLIAM HENRY DEALEY
. I was coming from Mrs. Bull, in St. Martin's-lane, on Wednesday afternoon, and in Gray's Inn-lane, the prisoner came behind me, and asked me to go on an errand—there was another boy with me—we said no—he then gave us 2d.—he walked behind us, and then left us—he then came down another street, and snatched the bundle out of my hand—it was Mr. John Wilson's property—Mrs. Bull gave it me at his house—it contained some shirts, stockings, and handkerchiefs—Mrs. Bull is Mr. Wilson's housekeeper—I am sure the prisoner is the person who snatched the bundle.





ELIZABETH BULL
. I am the wife of John Bull, of St. Martin's-lane, Charing-cross. I desired the servant to give this bundle of things to this

boy—it was the property of Mr. John Wilson—I had done them up, and knew what there was there.

COURT
to
WILLIAM HENEY DEAEEY. Q. You said Mrs. Bull gave them to you? A. The servant gave them to me—Mrs. Bull gave them to the servant.

Prisoner. I am not the person. Witness. That is the man, I know him by his face.




GUILTY of stealing, but not from the person. Aged 21.—



Transported for Seven Years.

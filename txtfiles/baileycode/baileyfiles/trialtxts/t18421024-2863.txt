 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

ROBERT MOODY HANCOCK
. I am a wine cooper, and live in Brook-street, Lambeth. About seven o'clock, on the 11th of October, I was in Fleet-street—I felt a push of a lot of persons against me, and a pull at my pocket—I turned round, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—I took him—he said he picked it up—he was within a yard and a half of me—there were one or two nearer to me than him.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Was anybody conversing with him? A. I cannot swear that there was—he could not have reached my pocket from where he was, when I took hold of him.





FREDERICK DURSTON
 (police-constable F 83.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

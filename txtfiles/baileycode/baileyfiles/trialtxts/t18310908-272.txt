JAMES FOX. I am a linen-draper - I lived with Mr. Pope. On the 23rd of August the prisoner came into his shop, in Ratcliff-highway, and asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs - Mr. Pope showed her some; she did not buy, but went away - I had suspicion, and followed her to three other drapers' shops; at last she went into Mr. Brown's - Wilson was serving her; she looked at some black silk handkerchiefs, and I distinctly saw her put some into her pocket - I went in, and asked Wilson if Mr. Brown was within; the prisoner was then taken, and I saw her pull out the three handkerchiefs from her pocket.

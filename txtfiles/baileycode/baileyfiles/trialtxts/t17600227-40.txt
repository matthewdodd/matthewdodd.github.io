            . I lost a pig; the watchman brought the prisoner and a pig to my house. I cannot swear to the pig because it was dead.

            . The prisoner came to my stand about three o'clock in the morning, in Long-Lane. I asked her what she had got, she said she had got a pig. I look'd and saw a dead pig. I asked her where she had it, she said at Mr. Spensley's. I insisted on her going to the watch-house to know whether she came honestly by it.

            . Mr. Bishop desired me to go to Mr Spensley's, at Clerkenwell, to ask if he had sold a pig to a woman. I went, and he said he had not sold one, but he had lost one.
The prosecutor's man swore that the pig was his master's property.

ALEXANDER SMYTH. I live in Mark-lane. On the 14th of January I was coming from Covent-garden Theatre; I walked as far as Norfolk-street


 - Mrs. Smyth had hold of my arm, and I had my umbrella in my right hand; I felt a severe pull at it, but I did not let it go: presently I felt a more severe pull, which bent my wrist, opened my hand, and got away my umbrella; I pursued the prisoner - a gentleman followed, and took him: I came up, and he was delivered up to me - I gave him in charge; I am certain he is the man.

            . I was on my way from Waterloo-bridge to Norfolk - street; I saw this gentleman and his lady followed by the prisoner - I saw the Strand; which got the umbrella from him; the gentleman called out that he had robbed him of his umbrella: I followed the prisoner, and took him by the New church in the Strand; I am positive he is the man.

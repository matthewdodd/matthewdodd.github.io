            . I live in Long-alley, Crown-street, Finsbury-square, and am a broker. The prisoner brought the lamp to my shop, about ten o'clock, and asked me to buy it. I asked him whose it was, he said, it was his own. I took him to the watch-house; he then said he had it to sell, for a man of the name of Powel, for 15s. - I told him I thought he stole it; he then said he got it from a rum place-that it was stolen out of Hatton-garden office. I took him there.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. Powel gave me the lamp to sell.

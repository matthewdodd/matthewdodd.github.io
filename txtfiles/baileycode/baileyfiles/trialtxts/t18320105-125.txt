            . On the 27th of December I was at Mr. Bennett's, who lives in Shoreditch, and keeps a pastry-cook's shop. At half-past six o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner loitering about his shop, and looking in - I was in the parlour; she came into the shop, took three pieces of cake, and went out - I ran after her, and took her with it; it was cake which we sold at 1s. a lb.

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner - she said her sister had six small children starving, and she was going to take it to them; she appeared in great distress.

            . This cake was mine - I had seen the prisoner the day before; she was suspected of taking a quarter of a cake then.

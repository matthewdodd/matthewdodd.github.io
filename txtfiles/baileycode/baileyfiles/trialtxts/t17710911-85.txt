             were indicted, the two first for 


               stealing a silver watch
            , the property of 
               
                  
                     John

            , August 14th
.


                  John
                   Early
               



            . I am coachman
 to Lord 
               
                  Charles
                   Cavendish
               



            . On the 14th of August I was coming up Parker's lane; 
               
                  Ann
                   Thomas
               



             picked me up, and took me up into a one pair of stairs room, in a house in Parker's lane


; she called up 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Wood
               



            , before I was on the bed. I found them both busy about me; I felt in my pocket, and my watch was gone. I said give me my watch; they said they had not got it; they called up 
               
                  Thomas
                   Ward
               



            , and threatened to throw me down stairs; so I went down and got the watch; I sent for the constable and staid till they were took; the watch was found in the bed, in Ward's room.
- Lyon. I am constable; I was sent for; I found the prosecutor pretty sober; he gave these girls in custody. The next day they were taken before the justice; they both denied it. 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Ward
               



             brought a rod, and said she whipped him while he was meddling with the woman; I took 
               
                  Thomas
                   Ward
               



             the next morning, he denied it; the watch was found in his bed after he was in custody. I searched the one pair of stairs room, but did not find the watch; when I took 
               
                  Thomas
                   Ward
               



             I fastened his door and gave the key to the servant maid, Amelia Green.
Amelia Green. I am servant to Mrs. Hopwood, in Parker's lane; all the prisoners lodge at our house; 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Ward
               



             had the lower room, and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Ward
               



             the one pair of stairs room.
Q. Does the man lodge there with 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Ward
               



            ?
Green. Yes; going into the room to make the bed I shook the watch out; Mr. Lyons gave me the key when he took up Ward; when I found the watch, the clothes were off the bed, and it was within the tick, wrapped up in a piece of cloth among the feathers.
(The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Q. How soon after he was taken up did you go to make the bed?
Green. A week; nobody had had the key.

                   Thomas
               



            's Defence.
I never saw the watch till I saw it before the gentleman I was committed by. I have no friends at all.

                   Ward
               



            's Defence.
This woman picked up the gentleman; he desired to have correction with a bunch of rods, and he gave me five and three pence to give it him; I gave him as much as I thought he deserved.


                  Thomas
                   Ward
               



            's Defence.
I was not at home that evening; the gentleman came there; I came in soon after; I went up stairs and called to my wife; I had no answer; presently I heard an outcry between the two women. I went up, the gentleman was wrestling between the two women, and said he had lost his watch. I desired him not to use my wife ill; they came down into my room, then the watch was charged with them. I went part of the way with them, and then came back and went to bed. I am a waiter at Mr. Brown's, at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



            . If I had known any thing of the watch I would not have left it there, nor have stayed there till I was taken up.

            . I live at the Hermitage







, and am a linen-draper
. I bought the silk the 10th of January. It is an article I use in my business, to line womens hats and cardinals. I missed the two pieces mentioned on the Monday following, from off the counter. About three or four days after an officer came with the evidence 
               
                  Anthony 
                  Fox 
               



            , and asked me if I had lost any silk. I said, I had. Fox said, he, in company with 
               
                  James 
                  Burnham 
               



            , stole it, and that it was sold to Mary Brown. She had been taken up before. The Justice ordered a search-warrant. I went with the officer to her apartment, by Rosemary-lane. We found some of the silk, part in a band box, and part in a drawer: it had been cut, and some run into two petticoats (some silk produced in court.) I believe this to be my property, part of the same I lost: it was lost in two different pieces, in two papers, 30 of half ell, and 42 and a quarter of 3 quarters.
Q. Have you measured this you produce here?
Horner. No.
He was ordered to measure it, which he did in court.
Horner. Here is 26 yards of the 3 quarters, and about 24 of half ell. This is made of a slighter kind on purpose for our own use. The general run are a stouter kind. The two prisoners denied the charge before the Justice.
Q. Did the woman at the bar claim the silk?
Horner. She never claimed or disclaimed it.

            . I am an officer. On the Saturday before the 8th of February, I was going to the barber's. A man that had been robbed had got hold of the evidence: he delivered him to me. He would not confess any thing at first, but after that he did, and said, he had been guilty of several robberies. This was before the Justice. I went with him to the houses he directed me to: the people all said they had lost the things he mentioned. He gave an account of this silk. We went to the prosecutor; he said, he had lost such. The boy said, it was sold to the woman at the bar. The Justice ordered us to go and fetch her, which we did. We found her in bed at 12 at noon; we went and found this silk in her apartment. The boy said, she bought it of him and the prisoner for 6 s. and he had 3 s. of the money. Burnham was taken five or six days after: he would not own to any thing at all, we took Fox the evidence and two boys in bed with three girls, like piggs in a barn; some little time before this, the boys promised to go all to sea, upon which they were discharged, and in about a week after he was taken again.

            . I shall be 16 years of age come Michaelmas next. I have known Burnham about 3 months; he enticed me away from my master, where I was apprentice to a butcher, into this way of life. We had been on the other side the water, we crossed to the Hermitage; between 10 and 11 at night, the maid was shutting up the window at the prosecutor's house, it was on a Saturday night, she went round the corner to shut the back parlour window, and Burnham went into the shop, and brought out two pieces of silk; we carried them to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



            's, she was at a neighbour's next door; he called her out and I staid below: he and she went up into the room, he brought down 6 s. and gave me three of it: when I was taken I confest it.
Burnham's defence.
I never was along with that lad in my life, this is all out of spite, I have seen him about in Gravel-lane, and licked him once or twice.
For Burnham.

            . The evidence was along with the constable, I was in at the Beehive in Nightingale-lane, there was Burnham's mother; she asked him how he could be so cruel to take her son away: he said the officers had made him drunk, and he did not know what he was doing of; give me a crown, and get me a ship, and I will never appear against him.
Brown's defence.
I bought this silk of a woman at 14 d. per yard, there was 17 yards of one piece, and I think 26 of the other; she said she came from Wapping. I had not money enough to pay for it, and I borrowed half a guinea, and pawned a sattin cloak, and then could not make the money up, without borrowing half a crown of my next door neighbour; this was about two months ago.
She called

He was a third time indicted for 


               stealing 7 woollen jackets, value 20 s. and a pair of woollen drawers, the property of

            , January 28





.
The prosecutors in these indictments could only say they lost the goods mentioned, and the only evidence to the fact was the boy Fox: the prisoner was 

               acquitted
             without calling him.

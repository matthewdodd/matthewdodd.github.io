            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's lodging on the 14th of October; I found a piece of sponge, some remnants of brown linen, and some duffel. The prisoner was then in the custody of Lavender. I shewed the things to the prisoner at the office; he first denied taking any thing but the sponge. This apron that I have in my hand, he said, was given to him by Mr. Wilson. I then said, I suppose you have taken the other pieces; he said, yes.

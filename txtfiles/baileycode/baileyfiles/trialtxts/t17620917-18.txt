            . I am a carpenter
; I was at work at Mr. Wade's in Noel-street, by Berwick-street; I had pulled off my coat and waistcoat and hung them up; and had not left them two minutes, before my master called to me; he had got the prisoner in custody, with my coat and waistcoat upon her.
Mr. Wade deposed to the seeing the prisoner go into his house, as he was on the other side the way; and as she came to go out, he stopped her with the coat and waistcoat it upon her.
The prisoner in her defence said, she went in for a few shavings.

Mrs. Cary. I lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, about the beginning of November.
Seth Cary. The Night the Robbery was committed, I came home about 6 at Night, and saw the Sash open, but I did not miss the Goods, 'till next Day. The Gang of Boys to which Correl belong'd being taken, one of them told me, they had robb'd me. The Prisoner own'd to me, that he took the Goods out of my Shop, at the Corner of Angel-Court, by Story's-Gate


.
- Carter, Pawn-broker. Correl brought the Flannel to me to pawn, and I lent 2 s. upon it.
Cary. I swear positively, that this Boy
 (the Prisoner) was carry'd to the rest of the Lads in the Gatehouse, he confess'd he stole my Goods. As soon as they saw him, they cry'd, - What Captain, - are you come too! Aye (says he) I am come among you my Boys. Let's see (says they) whether you are booted? Yes, yes, (says he) I am booted, and shook his Leg that was Iron'd.

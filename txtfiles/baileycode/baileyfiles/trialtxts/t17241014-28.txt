            , a Constable in the Trinity Minories, depos'd, That three or four Soldiers brought the Prisoner to him, telling him, that she ask'd one of them to drink with her, and show'd him a Watch, and asking her how she came by it, and another she had in her Pocket, she reply'd, she had got them by Dibbling in Southwark Fair. The Prisoner in her Defence pleaded, That she liv'd in Lamb Alley, in Bishopsgate-street, and the Prosecutor going by as she was going out, he put his Hand round her, and kiss'd her, and ask'd her to go and drink with him, which she refus'd, as what she did not use to do with a Stranger; 'till she thinking he might be some Acquaintance of her Husband's, did go in with him, and he telling her she was very like one that he had a Kindness for, ask'd her to grant him one Favour, which was to let him lie with her; and not having Money enough then about him to make her Amends, gave her the two Watches to make him a Promise to meet him the next Morning, at the Pye Tavern at Bishopsgate. The whole of this was deny'd by the Prosecutor, or that he had ever seen her, before he saw her after her Apprehension by the Constable. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found her 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

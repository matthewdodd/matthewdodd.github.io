THOMAS GORMAN



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the goods of 



Charles Wensley, from his person.






CHARLES WENSLEY
. I am a licensed victualler. On 30th June, about 11 o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street, and when near Farringdon-street I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner throw away my handkerchief, which I had in my pocket a minute or two before—I collared him, picked up the handkerchief, and took him to the station—this is the handkerchief (produced.)

Prisoner. Q. Where did you first see me? A. At the end of Fleet-street, leading into Farringdon-street; between there was a man and woman standing near you—I did not accuse one of them.





FRANCIS STANWAY
 (City-policeman, 311.) The prisoner was given into my custody with this handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was talking to three people at the corner of Fleet-street; this man turned back, picked up something, and hallooed "Police!" I did not make any resistance.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.
(The prisoner was further charged with having been before convicted: to which he pleaded guilty.)
(Henry Webb and John Mark Bull, of the City police, and Inspector Brannan, of the G division, deposed to the prisoner having been convicted several times, to his being a trainer of young thieves, and getting his living by thieving.)




Transported for Ten Years
.

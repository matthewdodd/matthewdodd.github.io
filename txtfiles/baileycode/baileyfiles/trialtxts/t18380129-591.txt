MARY ANN DELL
. I am the daughter of Daniel Dell, of No. 44, Rochester-row, Westminster. On Saturday night, the 27th of January, I was carrying a bundle to Mr. Williams, in Park-street—I was going across the top of Dacre-street, and the prisoner came and took the bundle out of my hand—I have no doubt it was him—I hallooed out, and the policeman was down the street—he ran into the policeman's arms—he took him, and showed me the bundle again.

Prisoner. It was a man that stopped me, not the policeman—I did not take the bundle. Witness. I am sure you took it—I saw you.





HENRY HANSFORD
. I live with my father, at No. 4, Dunn-street. I was in Dacre-street, and saw this little girl, with a bundle—the prisoner came and snatched it away—I saw him do it.

Prisoner. I never had it in my possession at all.





ABRAHAM WRIGHT
 (police-constable B 99.) I heard the cry of, "Stop thief"—the prisoner ran towards me—I took him—he had nothing then, but a man brought this bundle to me—it was picked up in the direction the prisoner had run.

Prisoner. I was coming home from over the water, where I had been to my uncle's—I went down Dacre-street, when a man stopped me, and gave me to the policeman—I had not these things in my hand at all.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Ten Years.

                     Clandel 
                  



               
            , was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a silver Watch, a silver Salt, and three Ells of Holland, in the dwelling House
             of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Green 
               




             , on the 9th of December
 last, the Property of the aforesaid Richard Green.
It appear'd, That the Prisoner was a Lodger
 in the Prosecutor's House, and though the Goods were missing, they had not the least Suspicion of her; but they were inform'd by a Neighbour, that the Prisoner brought a Watch to pawn, and by this Information, the Fact was examin'd, and the Watch found at a Pawnbroker's, where it was sent by the Prisoner, and pledg'd for thirty Shillings.
It further appear'd, That when she had receiv'd the thirty Shillings, of the Woman whom she sent to pawn the Watch, she gave her Sixpence for her Trouble, and then going Home, gave the Prosecutor a Guinea, which she ow'd him, and the Servant 
               
                  Maid
               


             two Shillings. This odd Proceeding of Stealing to pay Debts, she made use of in her Defence, but this ill Conduct was not of so much Service to her, as a former good Character, which being consider'd, she was only found 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 Shillings
            .

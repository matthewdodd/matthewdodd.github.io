            . I live in Purpool-lane, by Gray's-inn-lane


; the prisoner is a single woman; I lett her a ready-furnished lodging about three months ago, at 2 s. 9 d a week; the goods mentioned in the indictment were part of the furniture; I missed them about three days after she went away, which was the 17th of May, without giving any notice: we found a tea-kettle, a pillow, and two pillow-cases, at Mr. Lane's, a pawnbroker; the rest we could not find; and when we found her, which was on Saturday last, she owned she had sold the rest of the things to an old cloaths-man in the street.

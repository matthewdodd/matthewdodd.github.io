            . I am in the employ of Mr. Joseph Rumbell - he is a silk-mercer
 and linen-draper
, of Leicester-square


. On the 8th of November there was a cloak missing from our door at a quarter before eight o'clock; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner run across the street; I followed him, and gave the alarm of Stop thief! - I saw him caught with the cloak under his left arm - he dropped it immediately.

            . I am an officer. I was at the corner of New-street; I heard the cry of Stop thief! from Cecil-court; I ran there, and stopped the prisoner - there were several others there, and the cloak was at his feet; I did not see him drop it, but he was the first person running, and the cloak was nearest to him.

            . I am a coach-maker. I saw a man take a cloak from the rail at the door; I gave the alarm to the shopman, who followed him; I waited till he and the cloak were brought back; I cannot swear it was the prisoner, but the man was about his height.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I called at a public-house for a pint of beer, and, as I came out, three or four men stood before the door; I heard a cry of Stop thief! - a man ran towards me - one of them caught him; he got away - a man then came up, and accused me of stealing the cloak.

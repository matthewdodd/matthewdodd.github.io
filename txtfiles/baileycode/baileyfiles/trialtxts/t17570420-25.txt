            . I live at the Windmill in Nicholas Lane


. About a quarter before seven (I had seen him there before) he call'd for a pint of beer. My servant brought it in a silver pint mug. My servants were out of the way. I went down for a pint of beer, and when I came up I missed the mug and the prisoner. I went to the door and was directed after him, and took him in St. Martin's Lane, in a passage, about a hundred yards from my house. He had the mug under his apron in his hand. ( Produced in court, and deposed to.) I took him before a magistrate.

I was very fuddled, and went out in order to make ware, and happened to take it with me; but not with an intent to take it away.

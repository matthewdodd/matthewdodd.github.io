            . I am a painter and glazier
. On the 22d of August, I was in Dean-street, Westminster, going home; when I got to the corner of Orchard-street


, the prisoner snatched my chain and seals, and ran on-the chain broke. I pursued and collared him in St. Ann's-lane, and asked him for my property, he denied having it. I said he must, or else he had thrown it away. A watchman came up, and took him; another watchman brought my chain and seals. I am certain he is the man; he was never out of my sight. Nobody else was in the street.

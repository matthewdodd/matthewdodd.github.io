            . On the 5th of last month between five and six in the morning, the prisoner came to my house at Blackwall with some coals in a skiff, I thought he did not come honestly by them, so stopped them and him. There were about four bushels of them.
Q. What is your employment?

            . I keep a publick-house, and am a blacksmith, he came to offer to sell them to me, I took him before justice Bury, there he confessed he stole the coals, he made it voluntary, it was taken in writing, and signed by the prisoner, ( it was read) wherein it appeared he stole a boat at the Horse-ferry, Westminster, and went and took the said coals out of two lighters lying on the river.

            . I was sent for to justice Bury, my name being upon the skulls. He ask'd me if the skiff was mine that the coals were in; I said it was. There I heard the prisoner confess and sign this confession that has been now read.
Prisoner's defence.
These coals were given me by a man for assisting him with a lighter.

WILLIAM APPLETON
. I reside in Long Acre, and am a lace maker. On Wednesday evening, the 24th of October, I was walking down St. Martin's-lane—the policeman called me—I turned round, and my handkerchief was gone—I had seen it five minutes before—this is it—(looking at one.)





JAMES WESTMORLAND
 (police-constable F 141.) I saw Dowley walking behind the prosecutor with his skirt in his left-hand, and his other hand was in the pocket—I went to lay hold of him—Robinson said, "Hook it "—I seized Dowley—he pulled out his hand, and threw the handkerchief behind him—Robinson ran away—he was half a yard behind Dowley—I did not see him again till the next morning.

Robinson. I was not with him at all—I was in a public-house all the evening. Witness. I am certain he is the person.

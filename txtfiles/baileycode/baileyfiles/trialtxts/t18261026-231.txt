            . I am shopman to John Kinder Cheese, a pawnbroker
, who lives at Bow. On the evening of the 5th of October I saw the prisoners at our private door; they saw me, and went away. I went and saw them there again - Peters was rolling up a pair of trousers, and Donovan was endeavouring to conceal him; they were then sitting down - I took Peters; our apprentice took Donovan, who ran away, in my sight; the trousers are master's, and were safe five minutes before.(Property produced and sworn to.)
PETERS' Defence. I went with Donovan and two others to get blackberries - I sat down to tie my shoe, and as I got up my shoulder lifted up the trousers, and they fell.
DONOVAN's Defence. I saw him lift off the trousers with his shoulder; I ran away, thinking the gentleman was coming to beat me.
Donovan received a good character.

            . I live in Sheppard's-walk, City-road, and am a dealer in English timber
. I had a house at Enfield-wash


; I locked it up the latter end of December, and left it - I had lived in it in the summer; it was a private house - I intended to go back to it: the furniture was all safe when I left in December; I went down on the 10th of May, and found all the furniture removed - on the 19th of May I went to the house of Potter, who has been tried, and found a good part of my furniture there; I brought it away - Potter lived about a quarter of a mile from the house: I went to London on Sunday, and on going there on Monday, the 21st, when I went down, Hanley, Mead, and Wilson, the officers, were taking some of my property out of Hill's house - some of it was in the garden; I went into the house myself - he lived in Swin's-buildings, Enfield-wash; he is a labourer - he lives next door to Potter; I myself found a tea-tray, some chairs, and things - I pointed out what wasmins; the officers brought out nine chairs, a tea-tray, a bedstead, two wash-hand stands, and several small things- the value of the property which I lost was about 30l.; Hill had absconded - the property had been found at Potter's on the Saturday evening; I do not know myself when Hill absconded; I did not know him at all, nor Potter - I did not discover my loss until the 10th of May, and on the 11th I gave information at Worship-street; I found a large hole had been opened in my garden, and property had been buried there; we found Potter at home, and took him into custody.


                  JAMES 
                  HANLEY
               



            . I am a Police-officer of Worship-street. On Sunday morning, the 19th of May, the prosecutor gave me information, about four o'clock in the morning, and I went with him to Enfield-wash; we first went to the house of Potter, who was convicted in July; I remained in the house the whole of Sunday and Sunday night, and in the course of Sunday night Mead and Wilson, the beadles of Enfield, received information, and we went very early on Monday morning to a cottage in Swin's-buildings, next door to Potter's; we found a woman named Hill there - we went up stairs, and took possession of a bedstead, a mattress, nine chairs, a washhand stand, basin and jug, a knife-box, three pieces of carpet, a dish, a tea-board, and several other articles - we removed them into the garden in front of the cottage, and by that time the prosecutor came down from London, and identified them as his property; the prisoner Hill was not at home - I sent Wilson off to where he worked - the property found at Hill's I should think was worth more than 5l.; it appeared to be equally divided between him and Potter - I know nothing of Hill; Potter was apprehended before I went down to Enfield.


                  JOHN 
                  WILSON
               



            . I am a beadle of Enfield. On the 19th of May (Saturday) the prosecutor came to me, and said he had lost his goods - in consequence of what he said I went with him to Potter's, who was at home, and found a great quantity of articles - he was taken into custody; on Monday morning Hanley, I, and Mead went into Hill's house - he was not at home; I found his wife Ann Hill, at home - I found the property there which Hanley has named; I went to Mr. Walker's, where Hill worked, at Enfield brewery, but he was not there - it is about half a mile from his house; I had seen him on the Sunday, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, in Walker's yard, with a horse - I searched for him, but never saw him till within the last month, when I saw him in the office of Mr. Sawyer, the Magistrate's clerk - the property at Hill's was in the up stairs rooms; he had the whole of the house; his eldest child is about eight or nine years old - his wife was acquitted.


                  JOHN 
                  MEAD
               



            . I am a beadle. I went with Wilson to search the prisoner's house; I found the bedstead fixed in the room, and the mattress on it, and the different articles; the woman was very much confused, and I brought it away - Potter had been taken on the Saturday night, after dark, but I cannot say the exact time; Hill was given in my charge on the 11th or 12th of December, by a patrol of South-mimms.


                  JOHN 
                  WILSON
               



            . Potter was taken on the Saturday night - I saw Hill the next morning, but not afterwards.


                  WILLIAM 
                  EVANS
               



            . I went down on the 10th, and my property was gone; I found the front door on the latch -I had locked it; there was no appearance outside of the house having been broken open; nothing to call a person's attention to it - these chairs are mine, and what I found in his house; I have had them ever since Potter's trial, when Mead produced them.


                  JOHN 
                  MEAD
               



            . The chairs I produced on the trial are what I found at Hill's.

            . I saw Hill's wife burning one of the chairs - I live near them; Hill was about there until the things were found, but I never saw him afterwards.

            . Hill's wife worked for me; I did not see Hill - Mrs. Hill brought a fender to my house on the Saturday night, about nine o'clock.

            . I am servant to Mrs. Patten. I received a letter from her on Monday, the 29th of December, to take to the post-office - I did not notice the address - she gave me 1d. to pay for it, being after time; I took it to the post-office, and gave it into Miss Camplin's hand.

            . I am daughter of the post-mistress of Alton; Jenkins brought me a letter between nine and ten o'clock on the 29th of December - I stamped it, and charged it; the servant told me it contained money: it was addressed to

                  Wooldridge
               



            , Esq. Winchester- it was a very large letter, and weighed two ounces; I put it into the Winchester bag, and closed it myself: it was strapped on to the other bags; I tied the bag with a string, sealed it, and delivered it to the guard myself at two o'clock - his name is Sweatman.


                  WILLIAM 
                  SWEATMAN
               



            . I was guard of the Southampton mail coach in December - it passes through Alton. On Tuesday, the 30th of December, about two o'clock in the morning when it passed through Alton, I received the seven mail bags from Miss Camplin - they were on two different straps, but these two straps strapped together; one strap had the Alton and Alresford, Alton and Winchester, Alton and Southampton bags on it - the other strap contained four bags, which were to go below Southampton- when I got on the coach I unstrapped the two straps, and put the three bags which I have named on one strap, and buckled them with twelve other bags; after changing horses at Bishop Sutton, a mile before I got to Alresford, I strapped the bags in three different lots - the Alton and Winchester on the Honnslow and Winchester strap, with the other bags which I had taken up before for Winchester; I had to leave five bags at Alresford, and I took these five bags off at Bishop Sutton, and one of those was the Alton and Alresford; I should have had to leave six bags at Winchester, and those I put together before-between Bishop Sutton and Alresford, I put five of the bags together which I had to leave at Winchester, and the one I had taken up at Alton - I am quite sure I had it in my hand just before I entered the town of Alresford- I mean the bag from Alton to Winchester; I am quite certain of it, for I took it off the strap, and added it to the Winchester strap, and the Southampton bag from Hounslow; I strapped it to four others - as I strapped it, I remembered having only one ring to the bag, and tried with my finger to see if that ring remained safe, and found it was so- the mail reached Winchester about five minutes past four o'clock; I delivered the bags to the post-mistress' son.
Q. After feeling the ring safe, had you to alter the bags? A. After taking up the Alresford bag, I had to unstrap the Winchester strap on which the Alton and Winchester bag was, in order to put a fresh bag on it - the mail arrived at Winchester about four o'clock, and I delivered the bags to the post-mistress' son, and at that time I believed that the Alton bag was among the number; on my return I understood that the Alton bag was missing; I could not tell where I had dropped it, but suppose it must have been at Alresford in unbuckling the strap, in order to add a fresh bag; Alresford is fifty-eight miles from London.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Whether you dropped it at Alresford, or between that and Winchester. you cannot say? A. No; I am certain I had it at Alresford - it is usual to have two rings to a bag.
HENRY FLIGHT. I am the post-mistress' son at Winchester. On the 30th of December, I received the bags from Sweatman about four o'clock in the morning - I sorted them when they come in, and on looking them over I missed the Alton and Winchester bag - that was about a quarter of an hour after I received them.

            . I live at No. 4, Charles-street, Hampstead-rood, and am a watchman, in the employ of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests; I watch in the Regent's-park. On the morning of Wednesday, the 31st of December, I came off duty at seven o'clock, and went home to breakfast - I then went to bed, and was called up between nine and ten; I found the prisoner and my wife's son by a former husband there; the prisoner is my wife's brother-in-law: Ward lived at Alresford

Bank of England note- he was in my company all day, until he went away next morning; I did not go to Crawford - street with him - when he came to me in the morning he had a bundle with him, and left that to be forwarded with the other things on the Monday - he stopped and slept at my lodgings that night, and went off next morning with Mason to Alresford; the officer came to me the same afternoon to make inquiry.
Cross-examined. Q. He desired you to send him the things on Monday? A. Yes; that was the day the waggon went; Mason is his nephew - he has been brought up under the prisoner's care; he was taken up, and afterwards liberated.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Dent, of Crawford-street.

Farnham note; (looking at one) this is it; it is No. 6532, dated the 11th of June, 1828 - I wrote the address he gave me, "

            . I am a draper, and live in Little Russell-street, Drury-lane. On the 31st of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, alone; he bought some things, but not in my presence - I did not serve him, but Adams called me forward, and said he had brought a 10l. Farnham note; I told the prisoner it was a late hour to pass so large a note, he being a countryman - he said,
"If you don't like to change it I can't have the goods which I want - I want to buy a gown for my wife;" I called one of my shopmen forward to serve him; I made inquiry about it, and agreed to Adams' taking it.

Cross-examined. Q. At what hour did you take him? A. Six o'clock on the evening of Friday, the 2d of February - he is married; Mason was living with him: he seemed a poorish sort of man - I do not recollect his giving any account before the Magistrate.

Prisoner's Defence. On the 29th of December my nephew had occasion to go out to gather a load of dung - he generally goes out in the morning to gather it, and on his return, at a quarter to eight o'clock, he called me up - I did not arise, and he called me again: when I came down, he said he had found a pocket-book containing some notes, as he thought - I asked how he came by it; he told me he picked them up in the road; I asked where and he said opposite the aspine-trees; I looked into it, run it over, and saw it was notes - he proposed coming to town, to see his mother, it being New-year's time; he asked if I would go with him - he asked me to change the money for him, and he would give me something for my family; I bought the articles which are in Court. and the whole of the change I gave him in his mother's house.

            . I am the prisoner's nephew, and have been out of Court during this trial; I lived with him till I was apprehended; I get up at three or four o'clock in the morning: he is a poor man, with a small family - I go out early in the morning, to find dung in the turnpike-road, and one morning, three or four days before I was taken, I got up at half-past three o'clock -

                  Nash
               



             called me; I went up the road for Winchester, and over-right the second aspine-tree, I found a small pocket-book; it was a dark red colour - I opened it; there was some money in it, but being no scholar, I cannot tell what; I cannot write or read, but I have seen notes, and knew they were notes - I turned back, and went home; this was about seven o'clock- I got home a little before eight, or a little after; I do not know whether I found it a mile or half a mile from my uncle's - he was in bed when I got home; I called him, and told him I had found something, but did not know what it was hardly; I asked him if he would come to town to buy some things, and then he should buy his children something- he never told me whether it was money or not; I said I thought it was money; he opened it, looked at it, shut it up, and put it into his pocket - he afterwards gave me the pocket-book, and I gave it up at the Mansion-house; I am sure it was the same as the one I found: I came to London the same evening, and did not see my uncle change any of the notes - he left me at French's; when he returned he gave me the change and the pocket-book - I was taken up at the same time as my uncle; I did not tell the officer how I came by the pocket-book, nor did my uncle, in my hearing; I gave the pocket-book up before the Lord Mayor, when I heard what it was for - I did not tell the Lord Mayor how I got it; he never asked me, that I know of; I believe, when I gave it up, I told the officer how I became possessed of it, but I cannot be sure - (looking at a pocket-book) I do not know whether this is it; it is very much like it.
MR. GURNEY. Q. When Herdsfield came down to Alresford to you, did you not tell him, on his questioning you, that you had not found any thing whatever? A. Notthat I know of; I was questioned by Mr. Peacock, the solicitor, about it, in London; he told me to take care what I said, and to speak the truth; I cannot say whether I denied to him that I had picked up any notes.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you in custody when these questions were put? A. I do not know - I was not at liberty; I do not remember Mr. Peacock asking me any questions - I believe I was taken to the Post-office: I believe I was questioned, but I do not recollect it.


                  THOMAS 
                  HERDSFIELD
               



            . When I first apprehended Ward I told him it was on suspicion of having found the mail - bag: I told him some letters were gone, and some money- I did not tell him what sort of money; He at first said he was innocent, he knew nothing at all about it: I then searched him, and found one sovereign on him; he said he had got no more, and that he was going to pay away that night - I then told him he must go with me.
Q. Did you put any question to Mason at that time? A. I charged him likewise with finding the mail-bag, both in and out of Ward's presence; he said he did not know any thing at all about it, he had found nothing - he said, both in and out of Ward's presence, that he had found nothing; I brought them both to London - they had no opportunity of talking together till they got to prison, which was before they were examined; I took them to the Compter, and then took them to the Post-office, before they were taken to the Mansion-house; they were together in the Compter, with many other prisoners - I left them with the turnkey, to put them where he thought proper: I do not know whether they had an opportunity of being alone.

                  BEACHAM PEACOCK
               



            , Esq. I am solictor of the Post-office. When the prisoners came to town they were brought to me at the Post-office; I saw Ward first, separately from Mason - Ward stated that Mason had picked the notes up in a pocket-book; I put Ward aside, and questioned Mason - I told him he was in custody on suspicion of having found a mail-bag, and having taken some notes out of it - he denied that he had found any bag or notes whatever; I did not ask if he had found any pocketbook, that I recollect - I might have asked it: he admitted that he had come to town with his uncle, but said he did not know what for.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the boy appear a good deal frightened? A. It did not strike me so - he does not appear one of the brightest; I cautioned him, and said he was at liberty to say any thing or not, and whatever he said might be given in evidence against him.


                  THOMAS 
                  HERDSFIELD
               



            . Mason gave me up this pocket-book about the third hearing he had at the Mansion-house - it was several days after this conversation with Mr. Peacock; he had never before told me any thing about finding the pocket-book.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he give any account of it before the Magistrate, at the first examination? A. Nothing whatever - he denied all knowledge of it till the third hearing, when he held up the pocket-book, and said "This is the pocket-book I found the notes in;" I heard Ward examined at the Post-office, and I believe he said Mason had given the notes to him; he did not say that to the Magistrate till, I believe, the second examination: I did not tell the Magistrate what he had said, nor did Mr. Peacock, in my hearing; I know Mason denied all knowledge of the notes to Mr. Peacock and me, till the third or fourth examination, and he said nothing to the Magistrate about finding them till then - that might be the first time he was asked about them; I cannot say Ward ever gave me any account of the notes, except having them from Mason.
MR. GURNEY. Q. Did he, in the country, say one word to you about having any notes? A. No, neither of them; Ward said he knew nothing of any notes at all; he did not speak twenty words from there to town.

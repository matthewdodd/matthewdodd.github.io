SUSANNAH HOGAN
. I am in the employment of the Rev. Mr. Richards. He had dealings with Mr. King in August last—on three occasions I paid the prisoner sums of money for his master—these are the bills with the receipts—they are for 1l. 7s. 2d., 1l. 3s. 1d., and 1l. 2s. 11 1/2 d.—he gave me these receipts for them.





EDWARD KING
. The prisoner was in my employ, and authorised to receive money—he did not account to me for either of these sums—I had him taken—he said he knew he had done wrong, and squandered the money.

Prisoner. That was the money of another master.

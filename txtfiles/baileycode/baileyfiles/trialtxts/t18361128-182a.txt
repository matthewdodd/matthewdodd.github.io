GEORGE ABRAHAM
. I am servant to Mr. Edward Jarvis, who resides at a place called Little Heath. On the 9th of November, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I turned out two pigs of my master's on the forest of Hainault, about five miles from Laytonstone—I saw them again at seven o'clock at night, locked up at Laytonstone—I am sure they went the pigs.





JOSEPH RAITH
. I am a farmer. On the 9th of November I turned out three pigs at eight o'clock in the morning on Hainault forest—I saw them locked up on Thursday morning.





THOMAS GREEN
. I reside at Woodford Bridge, and am a labourer. On the night preceding the day on which these pigs were stolen, the prisoner slept with me in the stables—on the night of the 8th of November, he told me he was going to Romford after some pigs to drive home—he did not say how many—he went from me about ten minutes after seven o'clock in the morning—I was at a blacksmith's shop on the road that morning about half-past ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner with five pigs—he was coming in the direction from Romford, but he could have gone to Romford in the time—he was coming along the Lea Bridge-road—I followed, and had him taken into custody.





DAVID JOHNSON
. I am a police horse-patrol. I was on duty—I took the prisoner from Green's information, and took care of the pigs—the two gentlemen owned them.


Prisoner's Defence. I was hired by a man at Chigwell to drive them to Limehouse—he said he should be there as soon as I should.

JOHN DEWAR
. I live in Reeve's-news, South Audley-street, and am a journeyman saddler. About half-past ten o'clock, on the 23rd of May, I was walking in George-street, Edgware-road—the prisoner came up to me, and attempted to take my watch out of my pocket—I pushed her off and was passing no—she forced her company—I passed on, and after I got a little way I missed my pocket-handkerchief—I returned, and found it in her possession, and gave her in charge of the police—this is it—it has a hole in the border—I had no communication with her, not for half a minute—she spoke to me, and I pushed her off.





GEORGE WELLS
 (police-constable D 23.) I was called by the prosecuter—he said the prisoner had taken the handkerchief out of his pocket—she said it was here—I asked the prosecutor if he had any mark on it—he said, "Yes, a hole, that was burnt"—I said to the prisoner, "You had better give it up"—she would not, and threw herself on the pavement—I got it from her, and then she said it was his, and she said, "Ah, you----, you may transport me if you like."

Prisoner. I met this young man and another, and the other one palled my shawl off my shoulders—I was much in liquor—I asked the prosecutor where his friend was—he said, "Round the corner, in George-street"—he pulled out his handkerchief and put it round my neck, and then he asked me to go home with him—I said I could not take him, and then he said, if I did not give him the handkerchief, he would say I had robbed him.





JOHN DEWAR

re-examined. I was with another man—he had hold of my arm—I swear he did not take off her shawl—she had had a little to drink, but was not drunk,




GUILTY
.* Aged 24—


Transported for Seven Years.

1844. 




JOHN FOOT,



 EDWARD MORRIS
, and 




WILLIAM DABSTER
, were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
13th of May, 4 metal cocks, value 6s., the goods of 



Simon Press.






MARY PRESS
. I am the wife of Simon Press; we live in Upper Dorset-street, Marylebone. About three o'clock, on the 13th of May, I had four metal cocks, safe—about twenty minutes to four, I received information, and missed them—they have not been found.





JOHN SLOMAN
. I am a groom, and Jive in Hector-place, Marylebone. I was in Dorset-street this afternoon, and saw the three prisoners lying on the prosecutor's railings—I had known them before—they laid there about ten minutes, then Foot got up, and looked in the shop—there was no one there—he told the others there was no one there—then he cut down the taps, which were tied to the side of the door, and gave them to Morris, who gave them to Dabster—I gave information, and followed them up Seymour-place, round by the church, and I lost them.





JOHN BOOTH
. I live in Dorset-street. Between three and four o'clock this day, I was looking out of the window, and saw Foot go to the prosecutor's door, take a knife out of his pocket, cut the taps, and put them on the table—Morris took them up, and handed them to Dabster—they went of with them before I could get down.





CHARLES ALLEN
. I was at my father's door, and saw the prisoners run away—Dabster had something under his jacket—they went round by St. Mary's church, and I after them, and then Dabster showed them some taps.





ROBERT HOARE
 (police-constable D 72.) I took the prisoners, and found this piece of string, which had tied the taps, in Morris's pocket—Foot said, "You d----d fool, why did you not chew it, and then they could have nothing against us at all."

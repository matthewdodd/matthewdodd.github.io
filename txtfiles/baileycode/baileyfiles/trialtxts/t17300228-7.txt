                  Walthoe 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner Robinson, ply'd in the Street, and used to come in and out of the House very frequently, that he left the Spoons at 4 o'Clock in the Box in the Plate-House, and that about 6 o'Clock they were gone; that upon Enquiry, he was told by the Maid, that the Prisoner, 
               
                  Leonard 
                  Robinson 
               



            , had been there, that he suspecting he had stolen them, went to 
               
                  John 
                  Walton 
               



            , who was his Comrade, and who he had observ'd lurking about the Corner of the Street, and that Walton did Conduct him in finding Robinson; that Robinson being found, did own the stealing the Spoons, and went with them to several Places at Windmill-Hill, Hounsditch , &c. where they had been pawn'd and sold; Robinson's Confession was read in Court, in which he charg'd Walton with going with him to pawn and sell the Spoons.
There were other Evidences to confirm the Prisoner's Confession; the Fact therefore being fully prov'd against Robinson, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.
             but there not being sufficient Proof against Walton, he was 

               acquitted
            .

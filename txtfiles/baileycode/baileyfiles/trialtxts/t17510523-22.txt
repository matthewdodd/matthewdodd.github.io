                  Rogers 
               



            . Last friday night, a little past ten o'clock, going home to my lodgings, when I was in Gravel-lane, Hounsditch
, the prisoner took me by the arm, and ask'd me to give her something to drink, and handed me into a private house after a civil manner. I gave her some money to send out for liquor. Before I had been in the house ten minutes she laid her hand about my neck, and sell a kissing me; her other hand was working about my pocket.

Q. Was you sober ?
Rogers. I was a little in beer, but sober enough when I lost my watch. I miss'd it directly. Then I clap'd my back against the door, and kept her in the room.
Q. Was any body else in the room at that time?
Rogers. Yes, my lord, there was another woman that sat at a distance. The people without were breaking open the door at that time, to let her out. A man got in and said, do you come here to breed a riot with my wife; he got hold of a glass bottle, with which he struck me, cut a hole in my hat, wounded my head, and knock'd me down; other people put up the window, and threw stones at me. I have that man in the Compter now who abused me. One person brought an iron poker; then they called out for knives, &c.
Q. Did you perceive the prisoner take your watch?
Rogers. Yes, my lord, I did.

            . I am a watchman. Going my round about a quarter after ten this night, the prosecutor call'd to me, saying he had been abus'd and robb'd in such a place. He was all over blood. I went directly to the house, and could find no person in it but the fellow that is in the Compter now. The prosecutor gave me charge of the man, I carried him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable; then I went to the house again to secure any body I should find there. I brought up the man's wife next. Then I took assistance and went again, and met the prisoner in the court, much in liquor. I had seen her before at that house, so I took her to the constable. The man and she were sent to the Compter, and the prosecutor also.
Q. Is this a public house?
Morris. No, it is not, it is called a bawdy-house.
I have seen very bad proceedings there.

                  Keys 
               



            . I am turn-key to the Poultry-Compter. I had an information that 
               
                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



             had the watch. I took her into the lodge, and found 17 s. 6 d. in her pocket, which I secured for the prosecutor. She said, if I would go with her she would tell me where the watch was pledg'd. I went with her to Holloway-lane, where the watch was pawn'd for 33 s. I took it out, and paid 7 d. for interest. Produc'd in court, and depos'd to.


                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



            . I found the watch the morning after the prosecutor had been at the house in Gravellane, in the chimney corner among the coals. I pledg'd it for 18 s. 17 s. 6 d. is returned to Mr. Keys.
Q. Did any body see you find it?


                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



            . No, my lord.
Q. How came you in that house?


                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



            /. I had been there before.
Q. How came you to go there this time?


                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



            . I belong to the house.
Q. Was you there when the prosecutor came in with the prisoner?


                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



            . Yes, my lord, I was, and a great many more, but we dispatched the room directly, and left them both together.
Q. How many persons were in the room at the time they came in?


                  Ann 
                  Pratt 
               



            . I cannot say how many: I know there were five or six.
Q. to the Prosecutor. Is this the woman who was with the prisoner when your watch was lost?
Prosecutor. I am not certain whether it was her or not.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going for some radishes. The man followed me in, and sent for half a pint of gin, and about five or six minutes after, he said he had lost his watch. I never saw or touched it. I was not near him.


                  Jane 
                  Jones 
               



            . My husband is a labouring-man. I had been to get him some radishes, and stop'd to see the prosecutor struggling with two women, upon which I turn'd to see who the women were, but they were gone. I ask'd the prosecutor if he knew them. He said no; I might be the woman that took his watch for what he knew.
Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you say so to any body?
Prosecutor. No, my lord; I said before my lord mayor, I should know the woman again if I saw her.


                  Jane 
                  Jones 
               



             continues. The prosecutor said he'd kill all the women there till he found the right.
Q. Did you see the prisoner there at that time?


                  Jane 
                  Jones 
               



            . To the best of my knowledge I did not.

                  Clark 
               



            . I live in the next court to that where this was done. About nine o'clock that night, passing by, I heard a great hubbub, and some women who stood by say a man had been robb'd, which is usual in that court; upon which I stop'd, and saw the prosecutor come out with a stick in his hand; it look'd like a rocker of a cradle; he was very fuddled, and wav'd it about his head, saying he was robb'd, and swore in a vulgar manner, he would kill every woman he met till he found the woman that robb'd him. His head was not broke then, it was broke some time after that. A neighbour said to him, you should go to the place where you have been robb'd, and see for the woman. He answered, he did not know the woman if he met her, but he would have his watch.
Q. to the Watchman. Did not you say the prosecutor was bloody?
Watchman. What this woman speaks of was before I came; when I came he was very outrageous, and all on a gore blood.




               Guilty of stealing, but not in the dwelling house

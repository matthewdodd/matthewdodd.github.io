JOHN WELLMAN. I am a sailor
. I went to the Jolly Sailor, in Ratcliffe Highway


, on Wednesday last, and then I got drunk - I had a watch, four sovereigns, and some silver - I am perfectly sensible of that - I went to sleep - when I awoke, I had nothing at all - I do not know who was with me, but I recollect playing at skittles with some man - I should not know him - I do not recollect the prisoner.

            . I was at the Jolly Sailor, and saw the prosecutor come in very drunk - I saw the prisoner come in with three men, about a quarter of an hour afterwards - the prosecutor fell asleep, and I saw the prisoner take a watch, two sovereigns, and some silver, out of the prosecutor's pocket - he said he would take it to the bar, and leave it for safety - I went with him to the bar, and he there put down one sovereign - I said he took two sovereigns from the man - he said, most probably he had dropped it, would I look for it - I went to look, and he went off with the watch and money.

             (police-constable H 173). I took the prisoner at Mr. Tubbs, another public-house - he was in the back yard - I found on him 20s. in silver, a sovereign in his mouth, and this watch - he was quite sober.

                  James 
                  Brown 
               



            . I was at Mr. Belbin's on the 1st of September, in Vere-street, Clare-market


; I laid my cane down upon the table and it was taken away, I know not by who; and in about three quarters of an hour I was fetched to Weatherby's in Covent-garden, there I saw it taken out of the prisoner's hand; this was about 12 at night.

            . On Monday last about ten at night, I was spending the evening with Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Brown 
               



             at Mr. Belbin's; I heard him say, Mr. Belbin, where is my cane; a gentleman said, I saw a cane a little while ago; we looked about, but could not find it; a gentleman said, I dare say it must be one of the three men just gone out, that has taken it; they were utter strangers to the rest of the company: about an hour after a young man and I took a ramble into Weatherby's; the gentleman with me recollected the face of a person ( not the prisoner) and said, he was certain that was one of the three men that sat contiguous to where Sir James sat; I said, keep an eye upon him, I will go and acquaint Sir James; I went, and brought him there in a very few minutes; Mr. Belbin and another gentleman came with us; as soon as we came in, Mr. Belbin said, here are two of them, I know them very well, the prisoner was one of the two; Mr. Belbin went and looked at the cane in his hand; he desired the prisoner to let him see it; the prisoner refused it, and made a kind of a half wheel; Mr. Belbin said, I beg you would give me leave to look at it; no, said the prisoner, I will not; Mr. Belbin pulled it out of his hand and looked at it, and said, Sir James, this is your cane: we took the prisoner directly to St. Martin's Round-house, and by the way he offered the gentleman a bribe to let him go. In the morning he was taken before Justice Kynaston in the Strand; as I was going to take the oath, he made a spring away down the street, he ran very well; he was pursued, and taken coming up towards Covent garden; he was brought back to the Justice's; the Justice said, now you have done for yourself, this is a confirmation of your guilt. The prisoner said, as soon as I get my liberty I'll be revenged of you all, and particularly the constable.

            . The prisoner and two more came into my house and called for liquor, the night Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Brown 
               



             lost his cane; they were in the same room he was in; after Sir James lost his cane, we went to Weatherby's; there I saw the prisoner and another person with him. I said to Sir James, they have both sticks or canes in their hands, you had better go up and look at them; he did not much care to go: then I went; the prisoner stood with his hand over the head of his cane; I said, Sir, be so kind as to let me look at that cane: no, said he, I will not; I said, I insist upon looking at it: he made some resistance; I took it out of his hand; it was Sir James's cane, it had his crest upon it.
Mr. Watson. As we went to the Round-house, the prisoner told me, if I would release him, I should have liquor, or any thing that I chose; and said it was but a trifling thing, he had done twenty such things as that.
Prisoner's defence.
I am an upholsterer; when my work is done. I go home in order to clean myself; I met my nephew, and we went to the Mogul's-head in Drury-lane; we had come supper, and were pretty merry; I said, we will go and have some home brew'd beer in Vere street, I was very much in liquor; there was Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Brown 
               



            : I had brought a cane with me, and left it at the Mogul's head; we drank till about twelve; coming away very much disguised in liquor, I happened to take his cane instead of my own; after that we went to the Two Blue Posts in Russel-street, and had more liquor; then we went to Weatherby's there came Sir James; they asked for the cane, I said it was not their cane.
To his character.

                  Swinney 
               



            . I am an upholsterer, and live in Lincoln's-inn fields; the prisoner lodged with me from the 11th of June, till this accident happened; that night I supped with him at the Mogul's-head; he and a gentleman came to me, and asked me to go and eat some a-la-mode beef; we had a shilling in punch; after that we went to drink some fine ale at the Lamb; I do not recollect that I saw Sir James, there were three of us; I believe we were there about an hour and a quarter; we had only two jugs of ale there, then they went out; I went home, I do not know where they went.
Q. Had the prisoner a cane at the Mogul's-head?
Swinney. I do not know whether he had or not; he seemed drunk when I parted with him; I never saw him drunk in my life before; no body kept better hours than he; he never made any disturbance in my house; he is noted for a man that sticks close to business; he gets a guinea a week regular.
Q. Where is the other man that was with you at that time?
Swinney. I do not know where he is.
Prisoner. He lives at Plaistow in Essex.
Mr. Holbrook. I saw the other man in the courtyard here yesterday.

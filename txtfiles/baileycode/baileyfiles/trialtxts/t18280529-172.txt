WILLIAM PEARSON. I am a carpenter
. On the 22d of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I left my tools at a building in Regent's-park


; I went between six and seven o'clock in the morning - they were gone; I know nothing of the prisoners.

            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoners on the 23d of May, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles's; Lewis had got a basket; when he saw me, he ran back - I suspected he had stolen goods in it, and followed him; I lost sight of him as he turned the corner; and when I saw him again, he was giving the basket to Cooper - I knew Lewis before, and am certain of him; I took Cooper, and found these tools in the basket; Lewis made his escape, but I met him afterwards in Broad-street, and I took him; the prosecutor described the tools before he saw them.
LEWIS's Defence. This young man met me, and asked if I could find him a lodging - I said he could get one in Bainbridge-street, where his things would be safe; I went along with the things, and met the watchman - I gave him the things back.
COOPERS' Defence. This man knew nothing about it.
LEWIS - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 28.
COOPER - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 17.

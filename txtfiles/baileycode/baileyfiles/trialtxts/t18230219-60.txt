            . I live in Greenfield-street, Whitechapel. On the 10th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was by the church at the corner of Hounsditch


, and had a purse containing this money, in a basket. I perceived the lid of my basket move up, turned round, and saw the prisoner by my side. I asked if he had got anything of mine, he said,
"No." I said,
"I am sure you have," took hold of him, and found my pocket-book, with my purse and money in it under his jacket, in his hand. Brown came up and took him.

"Nothing," and walked on, heard the cry of Stop thief! and ran.

            . I was in the service of the late Bishop of London; his house was in St. James's-square. He died in July last. Early in March, in the Bishop's life time, three of the servants coats were missed out of the stable that comes into Charles-street


; they were worth a pound each. They were all safe in the yard about dusk. I have seen two of the coats since. This is one of them I believe.

            . I keep a saleshop, in Hemming's-row, St. Martin's-lane. I have known the prisoner Jackson, three years. I bought this coat with three others, about fourteen months ago; I do not recollect exactly the month.
Q. Do you know what business the prisoner was - A. He told me he used to water-roads. I gave the prisoner six pounds ten shillings for the four coats.

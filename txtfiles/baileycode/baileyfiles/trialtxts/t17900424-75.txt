I lost a muslin gown the 10th of March last, from Kensington


, about a quarter past four; it hung out to dry in the garden; the gown never was found.

             sworn.
I know the prisoner; I saw him on the 10th of March, about five in the evening, get over one fence, and get on another, and take off some linen from the lines; I was looking out of my window; the line was in the prosecutor's garden; I saw him take off one article; I could not distinguish what it was; I ran after the prisoner, and took him in one minute; there were two others with him; I am sure he was the man that took the gown; they said they had got no linen; the other two escaped; the prisoner was committed; I particularly noticed the prisoner, and am very confident he was the man; I looked on the ground, and there was nothing; this young fellow's hand bled.
Prisoner. I am innocent: I worked for Sedgwick, butcher, in Westminster; and Mr. Rush and Mr. Stent.

CLEMENT CHAWNER. Between six and seven o'clock last night I was in King-street, Smithfield


; I felt a tug at my pocket, near the top of the street - I turned, and saw the prisoner walking very sharp by my left side, towards the sheep-pens; I overtook him in the footpath, near St. John-street, and accused him of having my handkerchief: he denied it - I said."You certainly have it;" I turned him round, and found it between his two coats - he said,"Is this yours? I saw a little boy pick your pocket, and drop this, and I took it up;" it was my handkerchief, but the officer, who has it, is not here - the prisoner had got twenty or thirty yards from where I lost it; there was no other person near me.

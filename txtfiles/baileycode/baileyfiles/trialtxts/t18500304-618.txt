GEORGE GRAY
. On 1st of March, about seven o'clock at night, I was in Fox-court, Maiden-lane—something happened to my right-hand coat pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—he ran away; I ran after him and he got away—I spoke to a policeman, and in about five or ten minutes I met the prisoner with another man—I said, "That is the man," and the officer took him—I am sure he is the man.





JOSEPH HOOLEY
 (policeman, G 42). The prosecutor pointed out the prisoner to me, and I took him into custody—he said he was innocent, he did not take it—going along, he said I should not get three shillings and a tanner for it a day, it was not a case, I should find nothing.





HENRY ATTWOOD
 (policeman, F 152). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted August 1848, of stealing a handkerchief, 3 from the person; confined six months)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.

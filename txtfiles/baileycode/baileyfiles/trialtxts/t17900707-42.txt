FRANCES ROGERS sworn.
I am wife of 
               
                  William
                   Rogers
               



            . On the 19th of June last, I lost a trunk, and the things in the indictment, from the Whitehorse-cellar, Piccadilly, where I took a hackney coach, to take me to Upper Mary-le-bone-street



: me and a lady, Mrs. Brotherton, had five boxes and trunks; four of the boxes were put into the body of the coach; and one that belonged to me, was put into the boot; and through forgetfulness, it was left in the boot of the coach: the man drove off: this was Saturday, the 19th of June; I advertized it on the Monday se'nnight. I went to the Coach-office on Monday; and they persuaded me to stay till Friday. On Saturday last, I received a penny-post letter: I described the trunk left in a hackney coach: I went on Tuesday last, where I was desired to go by this letter; it was to Dog-row, Whitechapel. After the prisoners were taken up, I found a pair of my stockings in their apartment, in Whitechapel; this was on Tuesday last: the man prisoner, I think, drove us: I cannot swear positively to him.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you summoned some other coachman
: do you recollect seeing this boy at the Coach-office? - I did.


                  ELIZABETH
                   BROTHERTON
               



             sworn.
I was with Mrs. Rogers on the 19th of June last, at the White Horse, Piccadilly; and went to Upper Mary-le-bone-street in a hackney coach: there were two dealtrunks, and two other trunks, in the coach; a hair trunk was put in the coach; it was left behind: I know the principal part of the contents: we were taken up about half after eight: the prisoner was the coachman; I never saw him before.
Mrs. Rogers. Here is a list of the things that were in the trunk.
Mrs. Brotherton. I took particular notice of the coachman, while he was putting in the trunk; he seemed to make a difficulty of it.


                  MARY
                   ARNOT
               



             sworn.
Mrs. Clear brought a bundle to me and asked leave to put it into my drawers, and I gave her leave; on Tuesday morning Mrs. Clear brought another, and an empty trunk, informing me it belonged to a person that had lived well, and was reduced; I asked her no particular questions about them; in the afternoon of the Tuesday, Mrs. Clear came and drank tea with me, and told me there was a person coming at six to buy the property; about six a man and woman came in, and they went into my bed-room, and Mrs. Clear took out the bundle and carried it in; and they went away; I do not know what passed; Mrs. Clear called me in after, and told me they had bid too little money for it; I asked her what things they were; she said, a find of her son George's; a find in the coach; she told me before that they belonged to people who had lived in better circumstances; but then she contradicted herself; I asked her if they had been advertised; she said no; with that her son who was there, went out and fetched the paper, and they were advertised; then the man and the two women came again, and the woman took the things away.
You do not know particularly what they were? - They were wearing apparel; but I do not know particularly what; I am a mantua-maker; and that same Tuesday morning Mrs. Clear gave me a gown to make; she said she bought it, and I have brought it here; Mrs. Clear took the trunk away herself; when I received the gown it was in a great coat.
Mrs. Brotherton. The coachman had first of all put the trunk into the coach, and there not being room enough, he took it out; I took notice of him, because I thought he seemed rather to wish to put it into the coach.
Mr. Garrow. Was you at the office, when the driver of No. 206 was there? - Yes, I said he was not the person; but that the prisoner was: the prisoner only came in by accident; I was not quite so clear at that instant; he stood with his side face, and he went soon out of the coach office; and I could not get a full view of him.


                  JOHN
                   ALLINGTON
               



             sworn.
The prosecutrix sent to me last Tuesday to take up the prisoner; I searched the house, and found one pair of stockings, which the lady claimed as her property.
Prosecutrix. I can safely say they are my stockings; they are neither marked nor mended; but I have more of the same so like them, that I could not tell one from the other.
May not some body else have such stockings? - Yes, they may.
Can you tell whether that gown was any part of your property? - Yes, I can; there happens to be a mark of red paint; it was a great coat; I safely swear to it.
PRISONERS DEFENCE.
We leave it to our counsel.
The prisoners called four witnesses, who gave them a very good character.

               transportation for fourteen years

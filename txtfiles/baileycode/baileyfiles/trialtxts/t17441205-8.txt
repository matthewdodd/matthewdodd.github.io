            . On the 19th of September, about 8 o'clock at night, my house was broke open. I lost in money and goods to the value of 20 l. there were about 3 or 4 pounds in money, most of it was gold, there were some half guineas among it. The money, rings, and those things that were most valuable were in a bugle worked box, which stood in the back parlour; the door was forced open, and the box was taken away.

            . On a wednesday or thursday night, two or three days before Croydon fair, Leekey, Robinson and I, went out as usual, and going by Mr. Thompson's door, we saw it upon a jar; Leekey went in, and broke open the parlour door, and Robinson brought out a bugle box, then I went in and brought out several things, and Leekey came out with a bundle up to his chin; we carried a candle in a dark lanthorn, which we bought for that purpose. - Robinson carried the candle in, and stuck it upon the drawers, and we left it there.
Q. to Thompson. Did they leave a candle there?
Thompson. Yes, and it had like to have burnt the house; it was stuck upon some drawers. I forgot to mention the candle.
Uptabake. There were about three or four pounds in money, chiefly in gold, most of it were half guineas; there were rings, a snuff-box, and several things I can't remember.
Leekey. They ought to be separated; their hearing one another corroborates one another's evidence.
Uptabake. We broke the shell out of the snuff-box, and sold the silver with the rest of the things to Cane, for 4 l. 4 s. The money was equally divided between us, and with the money we shared, Leekey and Robinson went to Croydon Fair in a chaise and pair -

             was equally concerned in it.
Leekey. Why did not you put the money into the information?
Uptabake. I think it was so.

1761. 




JAMES WOODS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



Isaac Wilkinson, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ISAAC WILKINSON
. On the 13th of May I was in Puck-lane, Westminster, walking along—I missed my handkerchief—I did not feel any one take it—I went back, and Furber said something to me—I have not found the handkerchief—I know nothing of the prisoner—I had my handkerchief just before—it was at half-past eight o'clock in the morning.





SAMUEL FURBER
. I am a firewood-cutter, and live in Duck-lane—I saw the prosecutor coming by, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of his pocket, and cross over—I do not know what he did with it—I am sure he is the boy—I had seen him there with other boys at the corner—before I went in and told my father, and he told Mr. Wilkinson.





GEORGE THORNTON
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody.





GEORGE CARTER
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Baron Gurney.

JOHN FISHER



, breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



William Grady Mott, at 

St. Matthew, Friday-street, and stealing therein 12 watches, value 120l., his property.






JAMES CRISP.
 I am shopman to Mr. William Grady Mott, a jeweller, of 36, Cheapside—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Matthew, Friday-street—at a quarter before ten o'clock in the morning, on 19th Nov., I heard a crash at the window—it had been quite sound before, and I saw the prisoner, through the window, with a tray, containing twelve watches, in his hand—I ran out, and seized him with the tray in his band—he had not moved from the window—he struggled, but I kept him—the watches were my master's property.





JOHN MILLER
 (City-policeman, 480.) I saw the prisoner lying on his back, inside the shop, and I took him.

Prisoner. Distress drove me to it.




GUILTY. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

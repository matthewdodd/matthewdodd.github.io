            . I am clerk, and steward to General Smith; Deaner was a servant
 to General Smith; the General brought him over from Bengal, about last April. I saw the things mentioned in the indictment, about the 25th of August; the suppose is a cover for a, up they smoke tobacco in, in the east; the cup itself is about twice as big as a tea-cup. I had not seen the silver suppose some time Deaner went away from the house on the 25th of August; he was missed for some time, but he was brought back again the same day. On the 26th, which was Sunday, he went away again; I sent an advertisement to be inserted in the public papers on Monday, and he was brought home the same night. I was informed that he had bought and sold some pieces of plate; I taxed Deaner with it, and he told me if I would let him go quietly, he would shew me where he sold it; he took me to one Mr. Elliot, a silver-smith in Oxford-road, and upon enquiring of him, he said he had bought the gold suppose of Deaner. We took him on the 28th before the bench of Justices, where he owned he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment: Smith confessed that he was with Deaner when he sold the two supposes, and the ring, to Elliot, and that he received 20 l. 18 s. and that he had ten guineas of the money, and two guineas in another person's hand, which were sent for by the Justice: he said he had spent part of the money in a watch he had bought for Deaner, and in redeeming one of his own out of pawn, and that he bought a pair of silver buckles of Mr. Elliot for himself.

            . On the 27th of August, between eight and nine in the morning, the two prisoners at the bar came to my shop with a silver cup. Smith said, Deaner had it a present from a Nabob, and he wanted to dispose of it: I paid Smith 2 l. 9 s. for it. Smith came again about eleven o'clock the same day, with a gold suppose, I did not then know what to call it; I bought it to melt it down; I gave Smith seventeen guineas for it. I melted it the next day.
Court. I hope, Sir, you will take care how you buy things again that have been stolen. It was impossible you should believe the story told you by them wretches, when they sold you the plate. Could you think, they were in the honest possession of such nice and curious, as well as valuable things, and you see they have the appearance of gentlemen's servants? I don't know that I ever saw you before, and I hope you will never more come here. under such circumstances; if you do, I assure you, I shall take notice of you. I think you would have been much more in your place, had you been yourself arraigned at the bar with those ignorant people, than have appeared here as an evidence.
The constable deposed, that Smith confessed before the Justice, that Deaner stole them, and gave them to him to sell.
Deaner said nothing in his defence, but called upon Mr. Stone to give him a character.
Mr. Stone. Deaner is lately come from India. General Smith has had him about a year and a half. I knew him before he came to the General I came from Bengal with him; he has behaved very well till this affair. I believe he has been led astray by Smith.

Smith Defence.
Deaner brought the things to me to sell for him. I sold them to the silver-smith, and got 17 guineas for the gold, and carried it to him. He gave me half a guinea for a present; then I got my watch out of pawn; then he asked me to buy him a watch, which I did. He gave me 12 guineas to save for him, till he came from Sadler's-wells. I don't know any more of it.

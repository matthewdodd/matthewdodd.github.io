            . I am a shoemaker
, and live at Shadwell


. On the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the pattens hung in the shop, the four prisoners came in; Pinnion bought a pair of boots, which came to 7s., she paid for them and went out, I immediately missed the pattens and upper-leathers; I got the officer, and about eleven o'clock the next morning I saw them at the office. The prisoner, Ellis, stood with his back to the pattens, and Bowen was close to the leather.
JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I found the prisoners at the Paviour's Arms, public-house, three doors from Mr. Clarke s house, and secured them. When I went into the tap-room they called out, "here is a ding," which is a signal to throw any thing away. Bowen threw the leathers down, and Franks the pattens. The others came to the office voluntarily, the next morning.

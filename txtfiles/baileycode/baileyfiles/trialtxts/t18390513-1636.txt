 and 




ANN NOWLAN
 were indicted for

stealing, on the

Thomas Venables and another.






ROBERT VENABLES
. I live in Whitechapel, in the employ of Thomas and John Venables, woollen-drapers. The two prisoners came to the shop on the 25th of April, and bought a few trifling articles—as they were going out, the young man who served them told them they had stolen a piece of silk serge, and I stopped them—they denied having it—I told them they had got it—they both denied it, and said they had never been accused of such a thing before—they had been together there about a quarter of an hour—I went for a policeman—Ann Nowlan wished to have the goods they had purchased, and to go, and during that time the daughter, Mary Ann Nowlan, pushed the silk serge on the counter—I took it up, and accused her of having stolen it—she took it from under her cloak—she had been in the part where the silk serge was. taken from.





OWEN EVANS
. I served the prisoner Ann with some black cotton—the other prisoner was by her side—when they came in I was serving a customer with some black serge, and then I missed this from the counter.

Mary Ann Nowlan's Defence. We are wrongfully charged, there were other people in the shop—one person bought some of the serge—after my mother paid for her articles, one of the shopmen accused me of taking the serge—my mother has six fatherless children—she knew nothing of it.

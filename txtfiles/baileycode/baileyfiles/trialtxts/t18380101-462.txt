MATTHEW COOK
. I am foreman to John Zacharia Stewart, living at No. 1, Blackman-street, Southwark. I attend the shop—there are hats and caps there—on the 1st of January I saw the prisoner in company with another—I saw the other lad put his hand on some caps—I did not see him take one, but supposing one had been taken, and given to the prisoner, I pursued them—I saw the prisoner throw this cap away which had been inside the door just before, and a policeman took him—this is the cap.





WILLIAM PAENELL
 (police-constable M 128.) I saw the prisoner running—he threw the cap away—I knocked him down, and took him.





ROBERT ROSMAN
 (police-constable M 158.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the lad.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

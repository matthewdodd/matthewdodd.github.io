ISAAC VALENTINE THOMPSON
. I live in Upper East-Smithfield. Between one and two o'clock on the 17th of June, I went down stairs to take my dinner—when I left my shop, my coat was hanging on the corner of a bust—I was not down two minutes before I heard a noise in the shop—I went up, and my young man had got the prisoner with the coat—this is it.





GEORGE FLETCHER
. I am shopman to the prosecutor. I saw the

prisoner take the coat out of the shop—I ran and caught him with it a few doors—this is the coat.

Prisoner I did not take it—a man was coming out, and he gave it to me. Witness. There was no other person there—he was going out with the coat under his arm.





FRANCIS ULLITHORN
. I took the prisoner in charge.




GUILTY
. *Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JAMES OSBORN
. I am mate of the brig Harrison—she was lying at Son Wharf, Ratcliff. On 23rd Feb. I was in my bed—between three and four o'clock in the morning I heard a noise in the cabin—I called to know if it were the master—the master told me he was in bed—I then sot up, and took a hammer in my hand—the prisoner came towards me—I could not see him, it was dark; but I took hold of him by the collar of his jacket, and held him till the mailer got a light—the master went on deck to call the police—while I was holding the prisoner he tried to get away from me, but could not—while we were struggling, we fell on the floor—he took the poker to strike me, but I defended myself from him—the ship's company came, and the police, and the prisoner was taken.

Prisoner. I will plead guilty.




GUILTY
. * Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

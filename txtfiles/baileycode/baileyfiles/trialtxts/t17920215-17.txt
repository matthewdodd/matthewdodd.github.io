             sworn.
I am a plumber: coming from work, about eight, I saw the prisoner and two boys standing at M'Lellan's door; I suspected them, and saw the prisoner go in and take this loaf of sugar off the counter; he put it under his coat, and his hand over it; I followed him and took it from him, and he knocked me down and stamped on my breast; I cried out for assistance, which came; I carried the sugar and prisoner to M'Lellan's house; he would not believe, at that time, that he had lost any.
(Sugar produced, and deposed to by M'Lellan.) - I missed the sugar; there is 14 lb. and a cross on the bottom.

Prisoner. I have nothing to say for myself.

In consequence of his treating Clare ill, he was ordered to be




               Transported for seven years

Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

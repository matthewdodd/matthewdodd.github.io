                   (not in custody) for obtaining half a guinea by false pretences
             from

            . The prisoner came to our house on the 28th of December at night; he spoke to me at the bar, and went into the kitchen where my husband was; in a minute after came in 
               
                  William
                   Reddish
               



            , and they told him they had two actions against him; Reddish returned back to me at the bar, and told me that he did not mean to take my husband away that night, but he would unless I gave him half a guinea; he called the one an action the other a warrant; I told him I could not give him half a guinea; I asked him what his name was; he said 
               
                  William
                   Owen
               



            , a serjeant at mace, and that he lived in Bull-head court, Wood-street; Watson was then in the kitchen; I gave Reddish the half guinea; then Reddish went to Watson as soon as he received the half guinea of me, and they both returned to me at the bar, and demanded a 5 s. 3 d. for him, or they would fetch my husband down stairs; Watson took the money off the bar himself; after that Reddish demanded half a crown for his man, which I gave him: I did not see him.
Q. Did you ever hear Watson say what Reddish was?
Walker. I asked Watson, when Reddish said his name was Owen, if he was brother to the tall Mr. Owen; he said, yes; that was at the time the 5 s. was received for him; then they said if Mr. Walker should be bummed, that was their expression, next day, to c ome to Mr. Owen's office, and it should be settled then; I asked to see the action; Reddish produced it; it was 
               
                  John
                   Jones
               



             against 
               
                  John
                   Walker
               



            . Watson and he were both together.
Cross Examination.
Q. When was it produced?
Walker. That night.
Q. That was after the half guinea?
Walker. Yes, after the half guinea. and 5 s. they had in all 18 s. they told me if Walker went out of the door, there was one Gennis at the door would take him, and therefore if he went up stairs they would turn their backs and not see him.
John Walker. On the 28th of December Watson came to our house with another man, who afterwards I found to be 
               
                  William
                   Reddish
               



            , he came in and had a pint of beer in the tap-room, after that they came into the back room where I was eating my supper with a few friends; I said, Watson, it is Christmas-time, will you eat a little bit of cold beef with me?
Q. You knew him then?
Waalker. Yes; he said he had just crossed the water and could not pass my door without having a pint; he sat down with the other man and eat very hearty; Watson, before he drank his pint of beer out, clapped me on the shoulder, and said, I have a couple of little things against you; I said who took them out against me? said he, I shall not tell you the particulars now; said I, I should be glad to see the actions; he said, go up stairs, take your hat; I would not have you be taken out of your business to night and he said he would communicate the rest to my spouse at the bar; I did not seem to go immediately; he said, why do you not go up stairs? there is Gennis, the officer, at the door, and if you go out he will take you away; said he, this is 
               
                  William
                   Owen
               



            ; I said I did not know such a name; he said he is brother to 
               
                  Tom
                   Owen
               



             the officer; he said he was a serjeant at mace; I took my hat and went up stairs; I threw the window open to see if there was any body these; I returned and heard them both say, they would be d - d if they would go out of the house without the money.
Q. Are you sure Watson said it?
Walker. They were both together; they both joined in it; I heard them both say that.
Q. What is he?
Walker. He follows bailiffs; he is a Taylor by trade.

Cross Examination.
Q. Where was you when you heard them both say they would not go without the money?
Walker. Upon the stairs.
Q. Who was it they said so to?
Walker. My wife.
Q. You do not know when the half guinea was given?
Walker. It was at that time.
Q. What sort of an action did they tell you it was?
Walker. It is in the constable's possession here.
Q. Was any thing said about searching any where at any office?
Walker. No.
Q. Did you expect any writ against you?
Walker. No.
Q. Did you ever give civility money to any officer before to be excused?
Walker. That is not to this point.
Court. I do not see it will be of any use; if he has once been subject to extortion and fraud, that will not help your client.
Walker. I sent the next day to see if there was any thing out against me, and to search the two Compters.
Q. Why did you go to Wood-street Compter?
Walker. Because he said he belonged to Wood-street Compter; the officer next day fetched the prisoner from over the water, and I had him secured; the other never knew my house nor my person; he must be brought there by the prisoner.

I know Reddish; he is a Marshalsea-court officer, and the night of the 29th of December I went with another officer belonging to the city, having an action against a person; we expected to meet at the Bull; Reddish was there and drank with us; he said, so James Watson has mounted serjeant at mace; I was along with him and we knapped 18 bobs.

WILLIAM SECKER
. I am a porter and lodge at Mrs. Thompson's. On Monday the 18th of April, I went into my room and missed from my drawer the articles stated, which I had seen safe on the Sunday night before—this handkerchief now produced is mine, and was in the drawer with the other clothes—nothing else has been found.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How do you know the handkerchief? A. By this corner being cut off.





REBECCA THOMPSON
. The prosecutor lodged with me. On the 18th of April, at ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to take a lodging—he said he had worked at Pickford's, in Wood-street, for seven years—he did not know whether he should bring his box that night—he said he should come about eight o'clock, which he did, and remained about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he went up stairs with my little boy—he brought a roll of paper and I lent him pen and ink.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he is the person? A. Quite—I let him out—I saw him four times altogether that day—he came and sat down in my room, and I talked to him—I knew him again directly I saw him at Guildhall.





JEMIMA DANCER
. I saw the prisoner at Mrs. Thompson's on the Monday.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure of him. A. Positive.





BENJAMIN BURT
. I am a policeman—I took charge of the prisoner on the 26th of April, at Great Turnstile, Holborn, and found this silk handkerchief on him, a bunch of nine keys, five duplicates, and another handkerchief.

Cross-examined. Q. Where was this handkerchief which the prosecutor speaks to? A. In his hat with the other.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

            , and myself Brailsford Bright. We are wholesale druggists



. Mr. Kirk resides in the house, and no other partner but him. The prisoner was our porter
. In consequence of suspicion, we directed the officers to be upon the watch. On the 30th of May I saw the prisoner go out of the warehouse at eight o'clock, he had been at work in the laboratory. The warehouse is the bottom floor of the house.
Q. How do you go from the laboratory to the warehouse - A.Through a yard there is a wall that encloses the whole from the laboratory; he came to the warehouse and out of the door of the house. I did not see the officers apprehend him. After he went out the officers came in a quarter of an hour afterwards. I went with them to the Vine inn, Bishopsgate-street; they shewed me the two bottles of quicksilver, I knew them to be mine; there was a label on one of the bottles by which I knew it; the bottles of quicksilver were worth a guinea each, and the bottles 6 d.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's house. I followed him, and came up with him in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. I never lost sight of him. I caught hold of him. I saw Sapwell find upon him two bottles, one in each breeches pocket.

            . I asked the prisoner how he came by these, first, he told me he got it from Clerkenwell, and he was going to carry it to Petticoat-lane; he said it was oil; then he said he had it from a man at the corner of Camomile-street. I took him to the watch-house, and informed the prosecutor.
Q.(to Prosecutor) Was there any quicksilver in the laboratory - A. Not at that time, it was in a room above the laboratory, the prisoner had access to that room.
The property produced and identified.

Prisoner's Defence. I told them where I had the bottles from.

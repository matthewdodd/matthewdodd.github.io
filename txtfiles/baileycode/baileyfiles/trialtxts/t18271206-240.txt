            . I am in the employ of Thomas Slater, a haberdasher
, of Pitfield-street, Hoxton


: the prisoner came there on the 30th of November - he asked for some cotton - I served him - he said it was too coarse - I then showed him another ball, which he said would do; he paid me, and went to the shop door - he turned and snatched a parcel of stockings out of the window; he ran away - I called out, but he made his escape then, and was taken the following evening; I am quite sure he is the same boy - he dropped the stockings in the street.

            . I was sitting at tea - I heard the cry Stop thief! I ran out, and picked up one pair of stockings four or five doors off - I gave them to Mr. Slater - I did not see the prisoner near the house.

            . On the evening of the 30th of November I was in the room, and heard the alarm - I did not see the transaction, but I know the stockings.

            . I took the prisoner on Saturday, the 1st of December - I came down the street just after the robbery had been committed, and saw Atkinson against the door, almost fainting; she gave me a description of the prisoner, and I took him the evening following.

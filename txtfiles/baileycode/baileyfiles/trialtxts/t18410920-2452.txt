HENRY COX
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of September, 1 coat, value 1l. 10s., the goods of 



John Alphonso Doxat; and I coat, value 15s., the goods of 



Richard Reynolds.






RICHARD REYNOLDS
. I am coachman in the service of John Alphonso Doxat, of Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday, the 11th of September, I left the stable of my employer, in Half Moon-street, and left two coats in the coach-house, one my master's and one my own—I locked the door and took the key—I returned in three quarters of an hour, and the coats were gone—I have not found them—they had got in through the next coach-house to get them.





THOMAS HURST
. I live in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate. I took the prisoner about two o'clock on Tuesday, the 14th—I was standing at the corner of Half Moon-street, and saw him ran out of Half Moon-alley with a blue coat on with yellow buttons, which I knew to belong to Mr. Doxat's coachman—it was too big for him—he ran as hard as he could.





RICHARD REYNOLDS

re-examined. That was exactly the sort of coat I lost.





THOMAS PARISH
. I live in Half Moon-street. About one or two o'clock on Tuesday afternoon I saw the prisoner with a blue coat and yellow buttons on his back over his old fustian coat—I thought at the time that it belonged to the coachman up the yard, having seen him wear such a coat—there was another roan by the side of him, who had a kind of black bag or black apron, which looked as if it had been washed out a good many times—he went through the Hoop and Grapes public-house, down Petticoat-lane.

Prisoner's Defence. I was never near the yard at that time, and had nothing to do with the things.

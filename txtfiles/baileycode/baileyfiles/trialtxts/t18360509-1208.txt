JOSEPH ELDRIDGE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of April, 4 watch covers, value 12s., the goods of 




James John Gardner—2nd COUNT, describing the property as 1 1/2 oz. of silver.






GEORGE JENKINS
. I am twelve years old, and am errand-boy to James John Gardner of St. James-street, he is a secret springer. He sent me on the 5th of April, about six o'clock in the evening, with a dozen and five silver covers—I was to take them home to a gentleman—I had seen the prisoner about the street—I had never talked to him before—he touched me on the shoulder and called me Sam—I said, "that is not my name"—he asked who I worked for, I said, "Mr. Gardner"—he said, "Mr. Gardner in St. James-street," I said, "Yes"—he said, "I thought you was the same"—we walked on to Wilderness-row—I left him to go into a house—when I came out he was at a shop, and asked what I had got in my bag—I gave it to him to look at it—he put his hand in and looked at the covers—he gave me the bag again, then put his hands in his pockets, and told me to go on, and he would catch me—when I got to where I was going I missed four covers—I am sure he is the same person.





HENRY WILLIAM HAMPSTEAD
. I am a pawnbroker. I have one watch cover—I had four, but I was ordered to give up three at Hatton-garden—they were pledged with me on the 6th of April by the prisoner.





WILLIAM ALLEN
. I took him into custody.






JAMES JOHN GARDNER
. Jenkins is my errand-boy—this is my watch cover, and the other three were nine also—I sent Jenkins with them.
(The prisoner handed in a petition for a lenient sentence; and Mrs. Savignac, a widow; John Higly, a clerk; Rebecea Plant; Mary Davis, a widow, and Sarah Jacobs, of St. James-street, gave him a good character).

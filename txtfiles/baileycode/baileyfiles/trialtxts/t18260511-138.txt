JAMES BOLT. I am a shoe-maker
. On the 25th of April I was in Cork-street


, at the corner of Seymour-place, in the middle of the day - I had this handkerchief in my right-hand coat pocket; I felt something at my pocket, turned round to the left, and saw the prisoner making his way by me - he ran, and I ran after him. I ran up Homer-street, and stopped him at the corner of a court, and the handkerchief was found there - I took him two or three yards down the court.

            . I was in Homer-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner by the collar - I took him into custody, and took him to a public-house - while we were there a child brought in this handkerchief, and said she picked it up at the corner of the court.

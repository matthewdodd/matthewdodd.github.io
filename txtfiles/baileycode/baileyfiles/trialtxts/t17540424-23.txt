            . I live at the Black Horse in Barbican


; I lost a pint China bason of halfpence and farthings, it was about half an hour after eleven at night. The watchman knocked at the door and ordered me to carry two full pots of beer to a neighbour, I sent them by my girl; she left the door on a jar to let herself in. She came in in about ten minutes, and then I missed the bason and halfpence. I, by enquiring, found the two prisoners had been in my house. I took them up that night on suspicion, and they confessed they took the bason and money, and that there were seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny of it; and they had about them both six shillings and eightpence in halfpence; they said, they had broke the bason in Aldersgate-street and thrown it away.

            . I am a watchman; I took up the prisoners, [he confirmed the testimony of the prosecutrix]
The prisoners had nothing to say in their defence.

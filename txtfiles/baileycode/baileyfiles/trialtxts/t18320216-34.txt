            . I am master of a ship
. On the 26th of January I was in Church-street


, near Whitechapel church- a person touched me, and said two men had picked my pocket, and gone towards Whitechapel, one of whom was dressed as a sailor; I missed my handkerchief - I saw two persons, answering the description, standing on the opposite side of the way; I went towards them - they then ran off - I ran and caught the prisoner near the Constitution coffee-house; I have not seen my handkerchief since: it was yellow, with a red flower on it, and a border round it; I had it a few minutes before.

            . I am a baker. I saw the prosecutor in Whitechapel - he went on to Church-street; I saw the prisoner take from the prosecutor's pocket a yellow silk handkerchief - he put it behind him, and give it to another young man, who was close to him - they both walked away: the other person got away - the prisoner ran, and was taken; I swear he is the person who took it.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing through Church-lane, to go to my father's, when this gentleman said I had his handkerchief.

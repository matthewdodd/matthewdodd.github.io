. I lost my writing-desk on the 4th of August from a small room on the right-hand side of the door, but I did not know it till the next morning, when a person came and asked if I had lost any thing; I had used it between three and four o'clock the afternoon before.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time, on the morning of the 5th, did you know it was gone? A. About nine o'clock - I know nothing of the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I took the desk from the prisoner in the City-road, about five minutes before seven o'clock, on the 4th of August - he had it in a basket; I said, "Young fellow, where did you get this?" he said,"It is my own," that he lived in Charles-street, and I might go with him - I said, "You are only giving me trouble;" he said, "Well, it's of no use," and I took him to the watch-house - I did not see any person near him.
Cross-examined. Q. What distance was he from the hospital? A. I suppose one hundred yards - he went very willingly.
Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by a man to carry it to Shoreditch-church.

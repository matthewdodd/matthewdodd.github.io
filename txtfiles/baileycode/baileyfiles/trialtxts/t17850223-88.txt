On the 4th of February, I was in a room at the further end of my shop, I saw the prisoner pass and repass the shop two or three times, and I saw him come by the bulk of my window, slip off a bundle, put it under his arm, and walk away; mine is an open window, I ran after him immediately, and seized him.

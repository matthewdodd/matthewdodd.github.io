JOHN BLACKBURN. I am a sailor
. On the 20th of February, about ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in the street, and went with her to a house; and while I was asleep I was disturbed by my trousers falling, which I had put at the bed-side - I got up immediately, and said I believed I was robbed - I felt my trousers'-pocket, and missed two sovereigns, and 7l. in silver; the prisoner was not then in the room; the watchman came in, and called me - he told me to dress; I got up, and could not find my jacket - I am sure the prisoner is the woman I went there with - she had not come to bed.

            . I am a watchman. On the evening of the 20th of February I was in Blue Anchor-yard, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutor go into Harebrain-court; I met the prisoner some time afterwards in Newmarket-street, with this jacket under her apron; I asked what she had got; she said it was nothing to me - I took her, and found it was this jacket - I left her in charge, and got the prosecutor up.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house with the jacket.(Property produced and sworn to.)

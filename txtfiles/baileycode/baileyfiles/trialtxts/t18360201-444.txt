WILLIAM COLLINS
. I live in Jermyn-street, St. James's. I had occasion about nine o'clock at night, on the 8th of January, to go into a front bed-room in my house—Mr. William Gilbert Knight lodges there—I found the prisoner secreted under the bed in the adjoining bed-room to Mr. Knight's—I took him out and pulled a shirt out of his bosom, and another was found on him.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHAMBERS. Q. Where was this? A. In Jermyn-street, St. James's; it is an hotel.





WILLIAM DRANE
 (police-constable C 141.) I was called and took the prisoner, and found this waistcoat and one shirt on him; and another waistcoat was put down in his trowsers—the prosecutor has got that on—one of these shirts I received form Mr. Collins, and the other I took from the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. You have kept them ever since? A. I gave them

to the Inspector to be locked up—I marked the waistcoats—I took another waistcoat from the prisoner, and took it to the station-house, and took it home—I took the prisoner to the station-house—I went there direct from the hotel.





WILLIAM GILBERT KNIGHT
. This is my waistcoat—I had it on the 8th of January, and lost it at Mr. Collins's.

Cross-examined. Q. Are these three all your names? A. Yes; I did not mark the waistcoat—there is nothing that induces me to say it is mine more than the pattern, and having worn it regularly with others, and having missed it from my bed-room that night.




GUILTY

            . On Saturday the 2d of September, about 8 at night, I was coming along the Poultry


, the prisoner pick'd my pocket of a silk handkerchief.
Q. What makes you say she pick'd your pocket?
Ames. This is the handkerchief ( producing one;) before I could turn about to lay hold of her, she put the handkerchief into her bosom; when I spoke to her, she took it out and gave it to me. I took her up and carried her to the Poultry-Compter.
Q. Are you sure that is your handkerchief?
Ames. I am sure it is.
Prisoner's defence.
I pick'd the handkerchief off the ground, and put it into my bosom; when he turned about, I took it out of my bosom, and he took it out of my hand. My father and mother are both dead, and I sell fruit about the streets, and I pay a shilling a week for my lodging.

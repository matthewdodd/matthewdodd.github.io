FRANCES GROVES. I am a widow, and keep a linen-draper's shop
, in Charlton-street, Somer's-town


. On the 17th of March I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went to the door and saw the witness with Bumpstead in his hand; this cotton was produced, which had been stolen from my shop.

            . I live opposite to Groves's. About four o'clock on the 17th of March, I saw the two prisoners, whom I had been watching for about two hours; I saw Thomas take this print from a place, about a foot and a half from the door; Bumpstead was standing near thewindow, with his apron up ready to receive it; he took it in his apron and began to run - I crossed over and he ran into my arms - Thomas ran off at the same time.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
BUMSPTEAD'S Defence. I know nothing about it.
THOMAS'S Defence. I was going along and saw it laying on the ground; I stopped and took it up, and gave it to this young man - he did not know where I got it; my father has run away, and left my mother with four of us.

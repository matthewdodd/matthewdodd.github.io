            . On the 10th of October I was driving Mr. Jones's coach, and when I set off from my master's house. The glasses were safe, and as I was going along Charles-street


 I saw the coach door open. I saw nothing done to the coach. From information, I came up to the prisoner in Union-street. He had one glass with him. I saw another man before him with the other coach glass.

            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner. He let the glass fall. I took it up, and another watchman stopped the man with the other glass. These are the two glasses.
Round. They are Mr. Jones's glasses.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.

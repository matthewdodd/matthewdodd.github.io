            . I am shopman to Mr. Brooks, linen draper
, Duke street, Manchester square


. On the 18th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, she wished to look at some handkerchiefs; I saw her take the lace at the time I was getting the handkerchiefs: I put my hand into her pocket and took it out; I acquainted Mr. Brooks of it; she said the lace was not ours, she had bought it in a shop in Oxford street; I can swear to it being Mr. Brook's lace.

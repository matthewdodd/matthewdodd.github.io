The Prisoner lived above a Year in the Service of Mr. Holms and his Mother-in-Law Mrs. King, who lived in the same House. From thence she went to Mr. Scoley's, where she continued about 3 Months, and he (not missing any thing then) recommended her to Col. Armstrong in the Tower. Mr. Holms after some time missing his Goods, traced her to Col. 
               
                  Armstrong
               


            's, where she, in hopes to escape, jump'd out of the Window and broke her Thigh. Some of Mr. Holms's, Mrs. King's, and Mr. Scoley's Goods were found in her Box, and the Gown in the Bog-House, all which she confess'd she stole. She was sent to the Hospital, and there confess'd where the rest of the Goods were pawn'd, which were accordingly found by her Directions. The Jury found her 

               guilty
             of both Indictments.

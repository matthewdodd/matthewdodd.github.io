EDWARD WEBSTER WHISTLER
. I am a grocer, and live in Frenchurch-street. On the evening of the 24th of February I was in Cannon-street—I felt something at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner in the act of taking my handkerchief from by pocket—he pulled it entirely out, and ran up the street opposite Abchurch-lane—I secured him without losing sight of him—I am certain he is the boy—I saw him throw my handkerchief down.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

King



            .
MR. WYATT. I am a constable. On this day fortnight I attended at Mr. Maberley's, to intercept the tailors as they were coming out. When the clock struck seven they were coming out. I saw Banner throw things against the wall. This piece of cloth was under his coat; I took it out.
MR. STEVENS. The prisoner was a cutter
 employed by Maberley. This is a piece of white kersey, about two yards; it is a woollen cloth. There is a broad arrow upon it. It is worth eighteen pence a yard; there is two yards of it. The cutters receive thirty-six shillings a-week, and come and work in our warehouses.
Prisoner's Defence. The charge laid against me is totally false. I throw myself upon the mercy of the Jury.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

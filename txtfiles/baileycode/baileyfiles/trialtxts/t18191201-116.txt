, at Bow. I sell haberdashery. On the 27th of November I lost these things out of the shop-window - they laid together. I was in the shop when they were taken.

            . I am a headborough, and live at Bow. On the 27th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I stood at my door and saw the prisoners cross the road. I suspected and watched them by Mrs. Greenley's shop; when both returned, Green went in - Martin watched at the window; Green came out, and both went away together. I went into the shop, and then pursued and secured them at Bromley, both walking together. They had been out of my sight. Martin threw a parcel into a ditch, which I picked up - it was the frock and cotton. I found the cap in Green's pocket.
GREEN'S Defence. I picked the cap up.

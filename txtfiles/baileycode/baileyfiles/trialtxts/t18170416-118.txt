            . I am a shipwright
. On the 25th of February, I was at work in Mr. Dowson's yard, at Limehouse


. I pulled my jacket off, and hung it on the rail. I missed it at eleven o'clock. In about half an hour, I saw the prisoner come into the yard, and take South's jacket. I followed him, and charged him with taking mine - He said, he was never in the yard. I found my box and knife, which were in my jacket, on the prisoner.

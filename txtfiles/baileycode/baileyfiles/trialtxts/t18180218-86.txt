THOMAS KIER. I am a publican
 at the bottom of Highgate-hill


; the prisoner is a labourer
 in the neighbourhood. On the 12th of February, I lost my pig out of the sty, in the night; about seven o'clock in the morning, I traced the blood from my premises, up to the prisoners door, about fifteen yards off-the door was shut. I asked his wife where he was. I got a search-warrant, and found my pig concealed under his floor, in the cloth-it weighed eight stone, the head was cut off. I am sure it is mine; the floor takes up, and there is a hole to put things in.

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden; I went and found the pig under the prisoner's floor-under the loose boards, it had not been scalded.

            . I traced the pigs blood to the prisoner's door. Beeby found his cloth in the prisoner's stable.

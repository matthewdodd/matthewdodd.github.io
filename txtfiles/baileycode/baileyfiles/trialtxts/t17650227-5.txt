, October 30, 1764
.
The prisoners were committed the 5th of December, 1764, and as the prosecutor Morgan was a Mahametan
, they were continued in gaol for the opinion of their Lordships the Judges, as to his being sworn upon the Alcoran, which was delivered in court, by Mr. Justice Gould, in which they were unanimous that he might be sworn.


                  John 
                  Morgan 
               



            . I am a Mahometan.
Q. In what manner are people of your profession sworn?
Morgan. I touch the book, the Alcoran, with one hand, and put the other hand to my forehead; then I look upon it I am bound to speak the truth. (He is sworn upon the Alcoran).
Morgan. I was born at Bengal. I have come here twice before, with Indiamen; and have been in England this time about seven months. I came over with a tyger for Sir 
               
                  George 
                  Pigot 
               



            , who was governor of Madrass, and attend upon it for him now. I went from his house in Soho-square, where I live, to see a friend near Rosemary-lane


, about four months ago, and staying later than ordinary, I wanted a lodging: I was recommended to the house of the prisoner, which I believe to be a bawdy-house: I went there about nine, and a brother Mahometan with me; he is now at the governor's country-house. I went up stairs, and pulled off my cloaths, in order to go to bed, and the woman at the bar came up, and took away the things, except my shirt and trowsers. I followed her down, and told her husband his wife had taken my money and things; (my money, five guineas and fourteen shillings, was tied up in a knot in my sash, that I wear about my waist, on my shirt) he took and held a poker to my head, and threatned to knock me down; and bid me go out at the door, and not dispute with him. I said but little, fearing he would break my head: he bid me go along, and called me Black D - l. I staid till morning at the door within side, I having lost all the things mentioned in the indictment; (mentioning them by name). I went in the morning, after I got my jacket again, to 
               
                  James 
                  Murry 
               



            , hearing he was a constable: when we came to the house, the prisoner were not at home, but they were afterwards found and secured. I got my stockings and buckles again.
Q. Where was the other Mahometan that night?
Morgan. He lay in another room all night: he said in the morning, he then could not help it, but would go to the justice with me.


                  James 
                  Murry 
               



            . I live in Rosemary-lane, about two hundred yards from the prisoner's house, which is up an alley, in Rag fair. The prosecutor is a Lascar; he came to my house that morning, without shoes or stockings, and told me he had been robbed, as he has now mentioned: I went with him to the prisoner's house, and took Mr. Cottrell along with us, he being a beadle, but neither the prisoner nor his wife were at home. We went to the public-houses to look for them, and was informed the man was at the Ship, in Well-street: we found him behind the bar, drinking a pint of purl; the prosecutor said he was the man. While we were talking with him, in came his wife; then the Lascar said, that is the woman: we took them away; but going along, they talked Irish together; so I took one, and Mr. Cottrell the other, to prevent their talking. We took them to the Justice in Whitechapel: before they were ready to examine them, the woman took this sash (which the Lascar calls his silk purse; it ties round him, and in which he ties up his money) she took it from under her arm, and was going to drop it, but a man took it out of her hand, and delivered it to me. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) When before the Justice, I opened it, and there were in it Two Guineas, a Rupee, and one Firnam: the woman was searched, and in her pocket was found Thirteen Shillings and Four-pence Half-penny, and a white purse. (The purse produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).


                  Richard 
                  Cottrell 
               



             confirmed the account given by Murry.
Q. to Prosecutor. What do you say to the boy at the bar?
Prosecutor. I know nothing against him; only he said, if I would give him a shilling, he would tell me where I might find my things.

            's Defence.
I had no part in it, was I to die this minute at Tyburn.

            's Defence.
I am innocent. Whether the man had any money, I don't know: I am confined, and I don't know for what.
John and Mary

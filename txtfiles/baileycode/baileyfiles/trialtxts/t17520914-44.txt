. A gentleman that lodged in the house sent the prisoner up for his trunk into that room. She missed her handkerchief after he came down. She followed him into Lambeth marsh, and charged the prisoner with it; he at first denied it, but upon threatening him he took it out of his pocket, and gave it her. Produced in court, and deposed to.
The prisoner in his defence said, he found it on the second landing place on the stairs.

MARY LUCAS
. My father, William Lucas, keeps a confectioner's shop in High-street, St. Giles's. On the 3rd of April, at twenty minutes past five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner lurking about the shop—I had seen him before and knew him—I am sure it was him—my mother spoke to me—when I went into the shop again, the prisoner was by the shop counter, and he had the scales in his hand—he put them under his

coat, and went away with them—I told my mother, and then went and found a policeman—he took the prisoner in about twenty minutes—I have never seen the scales since—I am sure I saw them in his hand, and on the counter—I had not long done using them.





JOHN WOODGET
. I am a police-constable. Mary Lucas described the prisoner to me—he was standing on the opposite side to Lucas's shop in Lawrence-street, which leads into the Rookery—I secured him.

Prisoner. I never was in the shop in my life.





MARY LUCAS

Re-examined. I have seen him very often—he lives in the Rookery, I believe.

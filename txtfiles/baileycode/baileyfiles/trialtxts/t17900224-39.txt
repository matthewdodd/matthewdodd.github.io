: the parlour where they were stolen from, was on the ground floor; it was on the 29th of January, Friday, about seven in the evening; he took them with a stick; he opened the parlour door; I thought it was myhusband; and in a moment he dragged the things off the horse; I ran immediately after him; when he found I was so close, he took the things and threw them down a cellar; I saw him stopped; he said to me, he was only walking past the door: the things were picked up by Mrs. Saunders, and given to me: I gave them to the constable, Whiteway.
How soon did you see them after the man was stopped? - Immediately.

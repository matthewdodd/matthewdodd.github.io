            . I am a watchman. On the 27th of July, in the morning, I was on duty in White-chapel


. After the clock struck four, I went down the court where the prosecutor's premises were; the prisoner was talking to one of the prosecutors men. There was only one door in the court, and that was the prosecutors'. I watched, and in the course of about two minutes, the prisoner came up the court again with a bundle under his arm. Upon that he crossed the road instantly, and looked round to see if I was watching him; that gave me a suspicion that all was not quite right; accordingly I apprehended him, and found the beef in question on him.
WILLIAM STUBBINGS. When I saw the beef, I knew it to be mine.

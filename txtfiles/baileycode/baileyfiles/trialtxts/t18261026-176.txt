                  , from his person
            .
JOHN GRATTEN. I am a journeyman hatter
, and live in Devonshire-street, Newington-causeway. On the 15th of October, about eleven o'clock, I was in the Commercial-road


, going home - I had been out with a friend - I was accosted by two or three women - I was a little in liquor, and could not recognise any of them - they went away very abruptly - I then felt and missed my watch - I immediately found the watchman, and saw my watch again that night - the loss made me sober.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had only talked to them? A. They bugged me a little.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and gave up this watch; she said it was her husband's - I understand she bore a good character.

            . I am a watchman of Humberton-street, Commercial-road. I stopped the prisoner with the watch in her hand, about two hundred yards down the street; she was running; I asked how she came by the watch; she said she had none - I said, "I see it in your hand;" she then said she got it from a friend, and pointed to the Commercial-road; and in going along she said she took it from her husband, who was drunk in Spitalfields. I took her to the watch-house - I saw the prosecutor in the Commercial-road - he claimed it.

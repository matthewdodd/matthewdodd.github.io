                   Jones
               



            . I am steward to the proprietors of Ranelagh. I lived at the time this happened in a house adjoining. Sir 
               
                  Thomas
                   Robinson
               



            , Sir 
               
                  Richard
                   Glynn
               



            , and Mr. Dew are trustees; the freehold was bought some time ago; on the fourteenth of March I was informed some lead had been stole; I placed two men to watch in the garden, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Hearnshaw
               



            , and 
               
                  Daniel
                   Holmes
               



            . I ordered them to be in the piedement; it is a building we call a temple, at the bottom of the garden adjoining to the landing place; as soon as I was informed of the robbery I ordered the door to be locked that it might not get out that we had discovered the robbery. I caused a ladder they left behind to be carried down to Mill-bank; I went first to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and had an advertisement inserted in the paper with a reward of five guineas, but it did not answer the end. On Saturday going down Millbank with Mr. Beach he was called to, and told that one of the men belonged to Blackfriars. I sent one of the men to enquire after him; we discovered the prisoner's lodgings in Bear-lane; we got a search warrant and went to his lodgings; his landlady denied his being at home; we found him in bed in a two pair of stairs room, about eleven o'clock in the morning; the door was open; I waited whilst he dressed himself; he pleaded his innocence. I asked him when he had been at Chelsea, for his innocence would greatly depend upon that; he said he had not been at Chelsea for seven weeks; the officer shewed him the warrant; he said he did not know that he had done any thing wrong, and was very ready to go before the magistrate. I sent to Chelsea for 
               
                  Michael
                   Shaw
               



             and 
               
                  James
                   Callo
               



            ; we went to a house near Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; they declared the prisoner was one of the men that was at the Swan and Fox hounds at Chelsea on Monday the eleventh of March, in company with two other men; he still denied before Sir John that he had not been at Chelsea for seven weeks.
Q. Did the prisoner appear to be lame?
Jones. No.


                  Thomas
                   Hearnshaw
               



            . I am a waiter at Ranelagh. Mr. Jones set me and another man on the fourteenth of March to watch in the gardens; we were set about eight o'clock at night; we were concealed in a little place at the top of the temple.
Q. A large building?
Hearnshaw. About eight foot high; 
               
                  Daniel
                   Holmes
               



             was with me. About two o'clock, by the college clock, three men came a-top of the building by a ladder; the prisoner was one; when they first came a-top of the house, one of them passed where we were concealed, to listen, I suppose, if any body was watching; then he came up again; and they began working, cutting, and ripping the lead five or six minutes I believe; then I got out with the blunderbuss a-top of the house. I had no sooner got out but the prisoner came up to me with a knife, and was going to make a blow at me with his knife; he was within a yard of me; I told him if he did not stand I would shoot him; he still advanced; I was afraid of taking his life; I fired at his legs in order to disable him, that I might take him; he was about two yards from the edge of the house; there is a little wall about two foot above the leads; he threw himself head foremost over there; which is about eighteen foot high; the other men throwed themselves over in the same manner. I looked at this Boyce; he tried to get up and could not; I ran down to secure him; they had locked the door that I could not get out till he had got up.
Q. Are you certain he is one of the men? you say it was rather cloudy?
Hearnshaw. There was nothing to obstruct my view of him; and by the people we were informed the man lived near Black-friars Bridge. I went on Sunday by Mr. Jones's direction to find him out; by the description I gave of him the people told me his name, and the publick house that he used. I went and told Mr. Jones of it; we got a warrant on Monday, and went to his house; he was denied; we got up stairs; he was in bed; I said he was the man we wanted; he was asked about being at Chelsea, he said he had not been there for seven weeks; he said the same before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            .

Q. from the Prisoner. Whether I was not willing to go before the justice?
Hearnshaw. Yes.


                  Daniel
                   Holmes
               



            , who also watched with the last witness, confirmed the account he had given.
Richard Beach. I went with Mr. Jones and these men to take the prisoner; he was in bed; they had spoke of him as being wounded; when he got up he did not appear to be wounded in the least; and from that I begg'd they would not be too positive; Hernshaw spoke positively of him as soon as he came into the room that he was the man; Holmes was not quite so positive; I desired them not to be positive; the man said so positively that he had not been at Chelsea that I was afraid they were mistaken; therefore they did not speak so positive before the justice.


                  Michael
                   Shaw
               



            . I am a waiter at Chelsea. The prisoner was at our house on Monday the eleventh of March, about 3 o'clock, with two other men, I took particular notice of him; he staid but a little while; then he came about nine in the evening again with the same men and one woman, they only had a glass a-piece at the bar, and did not stay. I was at the public house by Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; I picked the prisoner out of a number of people, and said he was the man that was at our house. I said he was the man to the best of my opinion.
Q. Do you swear positively, or to the best of your belief, that he is the man that was at your house?
Shaw. Positively.


                  James
                   Callo
               



            . I keep the Fox and Hounds, opposite the Swan Walk, Chelsea. The prisoner came to my house, in company with two other men, about four o'clock, on the eleventh of March, and staid till almost nine; they called for a pot of beer, and one of them went out to fetch some bread and cheese. The prisoner went out: he returned again, and said it was not flood. I said, How far are you going? They said, To Westminster. I said it was an odd thing to come against the tide, and go back against the tide. The prisoner said, We come against tide, and we will go back against tide. The other two men said it is cold, we will walk. One, I think the prisoner, said, Masters don't go without me: I would rather carry you for nothing than go without you.
Prisoner. I don't deny this. I said I had not been there for seven weeks, till Monday.
Q. to Mr. Jones. Is that the case?
Jones. No; he said he had not been there at all for seven weeks.


                  Mary
                   Cook
               



            . I keep a house in Bear-lane. Boyce lodged with me.
Q. Do you know any thing of Boyce's coming home on the twentieth?
Cook. I can't be positive. I go to bed very early. I heard him between ten and eleven o'clock the next morning: I heard him limp as he went up; and I heard him sigh.
Prisoner's Defence.
When I carried these people up it was very cold; we had some purl and some hot; I drank with them. They went down to the Swan afterwards, and gave me some rum. I landed them at Westminster bridge, just before nine o'clock: I was, at nine, at Mr. Smith's, drinking a pint of beer and smoaking a pipe. The reason I was lame, was, I had had a needle in my leg fourteen years, which is worked out now.
Court. It is Tuesday night, the fourteenth of March, you are charged with ripping the lead.
Prisoner. I was at home that night, at work; Mrs. Cook knows it very well.
For the Prisoner.


                  Mary
                   Cook
               



            .
Q. Do you remember where the prisoner was the fourteenth of March?
Cook. I gave him the key about seven o'clock: I went to bed between eight and nine.
Q. What key?
Cook. The key of his chamber door.
Q. Who had the key of the outer door?
Cook. The street door was left unlocked.
Q. Do you know whether he went out after this or not?
Cook. No.
Q. Do you know whether he was at home all night or not?
Cook. I can't tell. He said he would carry the key to his wife, because we might be in bed before he came home.

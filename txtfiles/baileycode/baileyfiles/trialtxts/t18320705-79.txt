. The prisoner came to my house on the 26th of June; we had not a character with her, but she gave a reference, and we agreed to take her for twelve months, as a servant
 - she was in my house for an hour and a half, and then absconded; my footman then missed a creamladle, and asked me if I had it - I said I had not; I then missed several spoons and forks from a waiter - I did not see the prisoner again till the Friday following.

             JOHNSON. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Knightshridge. The prisoner brought this fork to pawn, on Wednesday, the 27th of June; we suspected her, and stopped her - she said it was not her's, but belonged to a lady in Grosvenor-square; I was going there with her; she tried to run off - I took hold of her, but she was rescued from me.

             (Police-constable D 19). Mr. Johnson came to the station, and gave me information that he was going to the place the prisoner referred to, when she was rescued from him by some Irish labourers - I went with an officer, and took the men who rescued her - I afterwards found her; this is the fork - there has been no more found.

WILLIAM PERRY. I live in Burn-street, Lisson-grove, and am a wheel wright
. I was at work at Irongate


 on the 29th of September; the prisoner had been working at the same place a month or two before, and was in the habit of coming there - I missed a plane, which I had been safe the day before - it was brought back again, but I do not know what day it was.
JOHN HOPE. I live in Little Westbourn-street, Paddington. I worked at the same shop with Perry - I lost a saw and Chisel.

            . I am a Police-constable. About one o'clock in the morning of the 30th of September, I saw the prisoner in Chaple-street, Edgware-road, running very fast, with this saw, plane, and chisel; I asked where he got them - he said from his uncle, who was a countryman, and lived at No. 2, Union-place; he then gave me another direction, and I took him to the station-house - the person he represented to be his uncle proved to be his father; he attended, and the prisoner told him where he stole them from - I find his father has not treated him well.(Property produced and sworn to.)

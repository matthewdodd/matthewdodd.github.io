JOHN CONNOLLY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
22nd of March, 16 plates, value 4s., and 3 water-plates, value 4s. 6d., the goods 



William Collison: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH COLLISON
. I am the wife of William Collison, a licensed victualler, and live in President-street, King-square, St. Luke's. On the 22nd of March I found the prisoner in our water-closet, with sixteen plates, and 3 water-plates—these are them.

Primer. Q. Was there no one else in the yard? A. There was no one else in the water-closet.





TIMOTHY DALT
. I am a policeman. I was sent for, and the prisoner was in custody in the house—the family told me what he had done, and I took him.





ELIZABETH JONES
. I live at the prosecutor's. I was sitting in the kitchen, on the night of the 22nd of March—I heard some plates rattle in the cupboards—I waited a little while, and heard the rattling again—I stood up, took the candle, and opened the cupboard door—I saw the prisoner take three water-plates out—he took them to the water-closet—I pursued him there, and called my master and mistress.

Prisoner. I was taken very bad when I got to the yard—a young man went into the water-closet, and when he came out I went in—it was dark—I did not see any one else—the servant said she saw my hand take the plates—it must have been the hand of some other person.





WILLIAM MARCHANT
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

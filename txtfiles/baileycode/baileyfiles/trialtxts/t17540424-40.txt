            . On Tuesday was se'nnight coming with a child in my arms to the Old Jewry, after I had got through Aldgate two men followed and asked me if I had lost a handkerchief; I felt in my pocket, and said I had. They told me they had sent a man to take the person who had stole it, and the prisoner was brought to me presently after.

            . Last Tuesday was se'nnight, about eleven in the morning, the prosecutor turning by the corner of the Minories


 with a child in his arms, I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and take out a handkerchief, with which he wiped his mouth, and then put it in his own pocket. He crossed the way, and turned down Houndsditch; I followed him, and as soon as I laid hold of him he threw this handkerchief out of his hand. [ Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]

I found the handkerchief, and when I took it up told the evidence, if it was his he might have it, and gave it him into his hand.

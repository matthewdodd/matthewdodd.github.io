            . I was in the service of Mr.

            , of No. 29, High-street, Islington


. On the 14th of July the prisoner came there with another person - the other person looked at some ribbons, but could not find any thing she liked - while the other was looking at the ribbons, the prisoner took the piece of silk handkerchiefs, and put it under her dress; as they were going out I went round, and took her - she dropped it from her dress- she was taken into a room, and given to the officer.

             (Police-constable N 124.) I received the prisoner, and have the handkerchiefs.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I hope my prosecutor will forgive me; I am subject to fits, and have been in the infirmary - I did it from distress.

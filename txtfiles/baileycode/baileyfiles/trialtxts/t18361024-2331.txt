JAMES MURPHY
. I am errand-boy to Henry White, who keeps a book stall at the corner of Blenheim Steps. I saw the prisoner there on the 18th of October—he took a book from inside the shop—he looked round, saw no one, and then put it under his coat, and walked across the road pretending to be lame—I followed him, and called, "Stop thief"—a policeman saw him—he dropped the book—I took it up, and the officer brought it to the shop—this is it—it is my master's—it was half an inch inside the shop.

Prisoner. I did not take it off the shelves, it was given me—I have had a bad leg for six years.




GUILTY
.* Aged 31.—


Transported for Seven Years.

On Wednesday the 12th of February I was standing at my own door opposite the Mansion-house, there was a press-gang hawling a man away; I had not been there two minutes before I missed my handkerchief, I seeing the prisoner next to me, took hold of her, and found my handkerchief betwixt her arm and her gown under her cloak, (produced in court and deposed to) I had it, I know, not five minutes before. She confessed the taking it.

            . I live at No.57, Thornhaugh-street. On the 15th of May, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and two others coming along, and using bad words, at the end of the street. They were quarreling about the division of some money, and charging one with cheating the other of 3s. I watched them, and followed the prisoner to Fitzroy-street, I then collared the him, and found the lead under his great-coat, tied up in his apron. I went to Mr. Muglishton's house, at the corner of Tottenham-street


, and found part of the lead stripped off. The lead found on the prisoner fits with the remainder.

            . I am an apothecary. I was in Mr. Muglishton's house every day. The lead was safe between eight and nine o'clock the night before.

            . I was at work in the house, and saw the pipe safe at half-past six o'clock. Next morning I compared that found on the prisoner, and it fitted exactly.

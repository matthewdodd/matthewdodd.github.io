            . I was passing through Saffron Hill


, on the 19th of October, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners standing opposite a broker
's shop; I saw the prisoner White take a pair of sugar tongs off a table, upon which I went to Hatton Garden to get some more assistance. I got Wainwright, the officer, to come with me. We secured them, and on searching them, found on James the brass cock in question, which Mrs. Coles afterwards owned.

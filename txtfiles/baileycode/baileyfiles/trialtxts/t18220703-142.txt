            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of June, at five o'clock in the morning, as I went through Regent-street, I saw the prisoner sitting on some steps; suspecting her, I watched, and saw her cross over, and go up the stairs of a house, and through the window I saw her take some linen off the lines; I went over and asked what she was doing there - she said she was doing her work. I took her to the watch-house - I took two pails and a brush from her, and Gook found this property on her.

About eleven o'clock at night I hung eight shirts on the lines on the first floor; they were all safe at three o'clock in the morning, when I opened the windows, and at half-past five o'clock the watchman called me, and three were gone; also two pails and a brush. Two of them belong to

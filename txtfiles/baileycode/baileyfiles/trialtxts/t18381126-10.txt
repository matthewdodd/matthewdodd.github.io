 stealing, on the

BENJAMIN KIDMAN
. I live in Upper Thames-street. On the 13th of November, about seven or half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw both the prisoners lurking about the prosecutor's shop, which is at the corner of Bush-lane, and directly opposite me—I saw Johnson go into the shop and take a piece of bacon out of the window—Cannon was holding the door open while he went in—when he came out they were going up the street together with it when I stopped them.






ELIZABETH GWYTHER
. I am the wife of John Gwyther, and live at the comer of Bush-lane. I lost this bacon from our shop.

CANNON*—


GUILTY

Mord Cohen. On the 23d of Nov. about half an hour after eight in the evening, as I was coming through Aldgate


, there was a great crowd; I felt a hand in my pocket: I turned about, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I took of him and the handkerchief too. (Produced in court and depos'd to.) I took him before my lord mayor and he committed him.
Prisoner's defence.
I took it off the dirt, he said it was his, so I gave it him.

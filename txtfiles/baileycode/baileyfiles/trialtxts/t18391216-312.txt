 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of December, 6lbs. weight of bacon, value 4s., the goods of 



Thomas Palmer.






JANE PALMER
. I am the wife of Thomas Palmer, who keeps a coffeeshop in Turnmill-street. My niece called me on the 6th of December—I saw the prisoner with two pieces of bacon, and my little girl hanging to him—as I pushed him into the door, he dropped one piece of bacon—it as my husband's—I had seen it safe not ten minutes before.





SOPHIA BAYLIS
. I live with my uncle. I was cleaning a shelf in the shop, the prisoner came and looked in and saw no one—he went in, took the bacon, and ran to the door, and as he was going out, I took hold. of him, and called my aunt—she came and pushed him in, one of the pieces of bacon fell, and the other was in his hand.




GUILTY
. Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years—Isle of Wight.

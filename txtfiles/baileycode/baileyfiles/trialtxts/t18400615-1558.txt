WILLIAM BARKER
was indicted

for stealing, on the 
21st of May, 6 bed sackings, value 12s., the goods of 



Charles Dagnall.






JOHN FARMER.
I am carman to Mr. Charles Dagnall, a rope and sacaking manufacturer. On the 21st of May, I was in Cripplegate with the cart about four o'clock in the afternoon—I went into Mr. Clark's, a worsted dyer, for about four minutes—as I came out a boy said, "There is a man in your cart with a white smock-frock on, taking something"—I ran to the top of Moor-lane, and saw the prisoner with a parcel in a bag—I said, "They are my sackings"—he said, "No, they are not"—I caught him—he threw them down, and got away—I took up the sackings and sung out, "Police"—a policeman came and took him instantly—these are my master's sackings—they were in the prisoner's bag—he said some man round the corner gave them to him.





JOHN STAINS
(City police-constable, No. 152.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I went to the end of White's-court, and the prisoner was taking off this smock-frock—he saw me, and dropped it, I ran and took him and the frock—he threw his hat off—he said a person gave him the sackings to carry to a court, but he refused to say where it was.


Prisoner's Defence. William Brown gave them to me to take for him.

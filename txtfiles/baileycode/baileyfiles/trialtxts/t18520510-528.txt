, feloniously cutting and wounding 



James Dedman, with intent to resist his lawful apprehension.


MR. COOPER
conducted the Prosecution.






JANE WHITEMAN
. I live at 17, Hartland-terrace, St. Pancras. On 30th April, about half past 7 o'clock in the evening, I left home—I returned about half past 8, and saw lights on the first floor—I went to a neighbour, then returned to my door, and the prisoner came out and pushed me down on the pavement, then another man passed out—I cried, "Thieves!"—I am sure the prisoner is the man.





JAMES DEDMAN
. I am a porter, at the London and North Western Railway. I was passing, heard a cry of "Stop thief!"and saw the prisoner running—I got before him, and stopped him—he struck me with a short crowbar on my cheek—it cut me to the bone—I took it from him, and secured him—I have a plaster on the wound now.

Prisoner. Q. Was not I in the act of throwing the bar away? A. You appeared to me to take a deliberate aim—you struck downwards with your right hand—I did not see it in your hand till I got near you, as it was almost dark; when I first saw it your hand was raised up—it was a little before 9; there was a lamp.





WILLIAM YORKE
 (policeman, 239 S). I heard a call for assistance, went and found the prisoner in Dedman's custody, who was bleeding at the face—the prisoner made no statement when he was taken.

Prisoner's Defence. I am guilty of the house breaking, but as for the cutting and wounding, it was purely accidental; a great many more men were running after me; I wished to get rid of the instrument, and pulled it out of my pocket to throw it away; as I was in the act of doing so, it struck him in the face.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(The COURT directed a reward of 5l. to be given to the Prosecutor, in addition to 1l. given him by the Commissioners of Police.) 

There was another indictment against the prisoner for the burglary, to which he pleaded

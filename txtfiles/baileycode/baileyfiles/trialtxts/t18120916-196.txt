            . On the 7th of August I heard a noise at the water butt; I looked down the court, and saw the prisoner running. She looked back, to see if any body saw her, or was coming after her. I overtook her, and took these two pots from her. One of the pots is mine; it stood on the water butt, and the other is Mr. Whetstone's.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.

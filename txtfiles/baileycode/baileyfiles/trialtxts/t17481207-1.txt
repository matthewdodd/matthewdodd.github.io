            . There was a man came on board the Holly, and told the Captain of this person who had the tobacco; I immediately went to see the Casks, and found one open; I told the Captain we found three more opened; he confest he opened the casks, and took the tobacco in the watch-house, and also before the Justice, and said, he was either drunk or bewitch'd, when he did it.

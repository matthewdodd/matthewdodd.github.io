            . Mr. 
               
                  Edward 
                  Jones
               



             is contractor for iron pipes to the New River company
. I missed a pig of lead from the works on the day in question; I had seen it safe between ten and half-past ten o'clock, at the end of our trench - I have seen it since at Marylebone-office - it belongs either to the New River company or to Mr. Jones; it has N. R. C. on it - they are cast in a mould; it was lead of this description - I have known the prisoner five or six years; I never saw the lead in his possession, or spoke to him about it.

Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know Mr. Jones is contractor to the New River Company? A. I am his brother-in-law; he is considered on his death-bed - the work is now left in my care - I am answerable for every thing; this was missed on the 12th of August - Mr. Jones was then at the New River-head; the prisoner was a deputy turncock - Mr. Jones did not tell me any thing about this piece of lead - I had sent it there that morning; I know he is the contractor.
COURT. Q. Are you foreman there? A. Yes; he buys the lead, and I pay for it.

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Church-way, St. Pancras, at a quarter past five o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner coming along with a piece of lead on his shoulder - I followed him perhaps three hundred yards; I then spoke to him - he said he had found the lead; I said it was false, as it had been evidently cut from some other piece; after some few words, he acknowledged he had got a piece more at home, and if I would go with him he would give it me; I went to take him home, but returned, and took him to our station-house, as he had once behaved rather rough to one of our officers - our superintendent directed me to go to his lodging, where I found his wife and children - I got the key of a little girl who was nursing one of his children: I there found this other piece of lead, and these tools by it, which I presume he cut the lead with.
Cross-examined. Q. Are there any lodgers in the house? A. Yes; I have seen him go into the house, and seen his head out at that window; I was behind him as he came out of his own court with the property - any one might have seen it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going by and found this lead; I knew the party it belonged to, and thought it might fall out of one of the carts - I was going to take it there when the Policeman met me; I worked for the company upwards of six years, and I thought I would restore it to them.

            . He was going from his own house, but not the nearest way to the New-river reservoir.

            . Q. Where was the trench? A. At Battle-bridge, in the public road - they had not been using lead from the time I saw it till I went to dinner; they did not begin to use lead till two o'clock - a person named Duggin was left in care of the things, and he gave me the information - he might have had his back towards the lead while he was walking about to take care of the tools - I swear positively this is the lead that was missing, by the marks, and there was no other lead there that day; I sent three pigs that morning, and one was taken while we were at dinner.
Cross-examined. Q. Was there not lead missing before? A. Never, to my knowledge; there was a great deal of lead there which belonged to the company.

             re-examined. Q. Have you stated all that passed between you and him? A. Yes; I am certain he did not say any thing else at all about it.
Q. I have your statement before the Magistrate; did he not say where he was at work? A. No; he told a brother officer that he had it from the gas-works at Battlebridge; he did not say he was at work there - he said it had tumbled out of a cart.
JURY. Q. What time did you go on duty? A. At eight o'clock in the morning; I did not see him go into his house.

HESMAN BRITTON. I am a shoe-maker
, I live at 9, in Clement's-lane


. On Tuesday, the 13th of June, about half past five in the evening, my boots were taken: I did not see them taken. The witness is in Court, who saw them taken. All I know is I missed them.

            . I am a shoe-maker. I saw the prisoner take the boots from the door. I was in the shop. He ran up the Court with them. I pursued him, and he threw the boots at me. I picked the boots up, and ran after him. The gentleman is in Court who stopped him.
Q. Did you lose sight of him at all - A. No, I did not; not at all. I am sure he is the man.

            . I am a printer. I was returning home from my work, when this affair happened. I saw the prisoner running, and heard a cry of stop thief. He was pursued by the last witness. I tried to stop him; he struck at me, but did not hit me, because I stumbled back against a door-way. He passed me, and ran up Plough-court, into Carey-street; upon which, I pursued him, crying stop thief; he turned to the right, towards Chancery-lane. Two gentlemen were coming along with a lady, and he ran across the way, and put his back against the wall. I went up, and took him, and he asked for mercy, and that is all I know.
Prisoner. When you was before the magistrate, you said, you stopped me?
COURT. And so he did. You did not go any further.

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoner and boots into my custody.
COURT. Q. Now, Mr. Britton. Look at these boots, are they your property - A. They are.
COURT. Q. To Hardy. Are these the same boots that you picked up - A. Yes, they are.
Prisoner. Q. To Britton. Was your shop door shut, or open - A. Shut.
Q. Did you see me - A. No, I did not see you at all.

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 24th of December, I met the prisoner in Charlotte-street, three of four hundred yards from the prosecutor's, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - he had the turkey by his left side; I asked what he had there - he would not tell me; I took hold of him - he got from me, ran up the street, and into a house - I caught him by the tail of his coat, pulled him out, and took him to the watch-house; I found on him this rope, which is used to let themselves down into areas with.

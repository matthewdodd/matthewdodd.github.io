            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I went to dip a child in the water that has not it's health; and when I came home, I met the prisoner on the stairs coming down from my room. I ask'd her were she had been. She said somebody call'd Old Cloaths; so she went up, that being her business. I let her go down. I ran up, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I ran in the street, and made an out-cry, and she was taken with my goods upon her.
Prisoner's Defence.
I used to buy old cloaths in the house where these people live. I went up to see if they had any more to sell. I had these things in my apron, having bought them of a woman for 14 s. 6 d. about half an hour before.

             sworn.
I know the prosecutors Jonathan Hill and 
               
                  Robert
                   Greatrix
               



            ; I know this beam was stolen, but who stole it, or when, I cannot say; it may be about three weeks ago, as nigh as I can guess, the door of the warehouse was not locked that night, in the morning it was gone, the warehouse was so full of goods we could not lock it.
Had you nobody to watch it? - No.
(The beam produced.)
I took it from the prisoner at half pasteight in the morning, the 28th of September last; I stopped him, he told me it was delivered to him by two men, and that they gave him four pence to carry it to the potatoe-warehouse in Broad St. Giles's; I have had the use of it every morning and night for these four years past.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going home, two men called after me and asked me to carry this.



               GUILTY
            .




               Transported for seven years
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

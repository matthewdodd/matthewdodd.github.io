            , ESQ.
 On Friday the 16th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning I was passing through Long-lane


, and nearly opposite the turning which goes into Charterhouse-square, I felt what I supposed to be a hand in my pocket, I instantly turned round and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; he was in company with another person, I laid hold of him and gave him to a constable.

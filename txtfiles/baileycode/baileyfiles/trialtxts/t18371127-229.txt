CHARLES DUCKRELL
 and 




JOHN STANLEY
 were indicted for

 feloniously receiving, on the 
21st of October, 1 chaise, value 18l., the goods of 




William Reading.


MR. PHILLIPS
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM READING
. I am a coachmaker, and live at No. 9, Mortimer-street. I had a chaise safe on the 21st of October, at one o'clock—I missed ft at two—I have since seen it—it is worth 18l






HENRY BRITTAIN
. I am shopman to Mr. Higginbotham. On the 21st of October the prisoner Stanley came with Duckrell to ask if I would buy a chaise—it was brought to the door—I gave 3l. for it, and 5s. to Stanley, who said it had been at his place three months—Duckrell was present, but made no remark—I afterwards sold it for 3l. 10s.

Stanley. Q. Did you hear me say it had been at my place for three months? A. Yes; Mr. Higginbotham and myself were standing at the door at the time—the Magistrate did not think proper that Mr. Higginbotham should be present at the trial, as he would have said the same.

Stanley. Rosedale called me up to the door, Duckrell asked me if I could find him a customer—I said I could, and I went and sold it for Harvey—I did not know it was stolen.





HENRY BRITTAIN

re-examined. I am quite positive that Stanley said it had been at his place three months—the chaise was given to Mr. Reading.





WILLIAM READING
. It was my chaise, and is worth 18l.

STANLEY—


GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

DUCKRELL—


NOT GUILTY
.

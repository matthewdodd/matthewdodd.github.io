            . On the 31st of May, between ten and eleven at night, as I was standing by St. Dunstan's church


, talking to a coachman, I missed my handkerchief; the prisoner stood by me, and I begged leave to search him; he said yes, sir, you may; I did, and found my handkerchief in his bosom; Mr. Reath has it. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).

            . I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; the prosecutor charged him with taking his handkerchief; he said he found it on the ground.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was coming along Fleet-street I picked up the handkerchief; the prosecutor was standing talking with a drunken man: he laid hold of me, and said I had taken his handkerchief. I told the constable when I came to the watch-house that I found it.

George Clark Trinder: Nash having been before convicted.






WILLIAM WELLING
. I am in the service of Mr. Robert Smith, a surgeon, at Westbourne-grove, Bayswater. On 25th July, I was in Richmond-road, between two and three o'clock—I saw Nash in Mr. Trinder's shop, leaning over the counter, and in the act of taking money out of the till—Williamson was outside, watching against the window—Nash came out, and gave him the money—I told Mr. Trinder—he ran after him.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Had you ever seen them before? A. No.





GEORGE CLARK TRINDER
. I am a baker, of Richmond-road, Paddington. I was in an out-house, at the back of my premises—an alarm of "Stop, thief!" was given—I ran after the prisoners for half a mile, took them, and gave them in charge—I saw the officer take 3s. from Williamson's hand—I missed some money from my till, which was safe half an hour before.

Cross-examined. Q. How far were the boys off when the witness pointed them out? A. I suppose a hundred yards, running as fast as they could—I kept them in sight.





WILLIAM DEALY
 (policeman, T 56). I was on duty at Westbournegrove—I took the prisoners—I found these three shillings in Williamson's mouth.—(The certificate of conviction being produced, was found to relate to Williamson, and not Nash.)

            . I live at Hampstead


, and keep an ass
. On the 3rd of May it was on Hampstead-heath - I did not miss it till the patrol said he had taken a young man with it; I went to the Bell, saw it, and knew it to be mine.

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I turned the ass out on the heath on the 3rd of May - I did not miss it till the patrol came; I saw it the next day, and knew it.

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner on the bridge at Hendon, with the ass - I took him, and showed the ass to the prosecutor and his son, who both knew it; it had a mark on the shoulder - the prisoner first said it was his own.
Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Red Lion, and met two grooms whom I knew - they asked me to have something to drink; I stopped till rather late, and got too much to drink - I did not know what I was about.

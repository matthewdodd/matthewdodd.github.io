            's house in Cross-lane, Saint Giles's


, at nine in the evening, to lodge there; I do not know how I came there; I met the prisoner in Holborn, and she took me to her house. I lost a cotton gown, value twelve shillings, a black silk cloak, value five shillings, four neck handkerchiefs, value three shillings, a pair of worked muslin ruffles, value two shillings, two muslin aprons, one value twelve shillings, the other, value nine shillings, two linen aprons, value four shillings, two pocket handkerchiefs, value sixteen-pence, a night cap, value four-pence, two pair of cotton stockings, value four shillings, a linen pocket, value ten-pence, and the money I am positive to is eleven shillings; I lost them at the place where

             lived: I saw the daughter. I was going to my lodgings in Henrietta-street, in Oxford-street: I met 
               
                  Ann
                   Hutchinson
               



             in Holborn, and she accosted me; why you are frightened? no, says I, I am not frightened, but I wish I could get a lodging nearer than where I am; she said, I should be welcome to her house; and sent her young child to Scotch Court, Cross-lane, Saint Giles's; when I got there I undressed myself and went to bed, and placed my things in a chair by the bed side; about nine, after I had been asleep two or three hours, I heard a great noise; I saw both the prisoners come into the room; her daughter came to the bed side and asked her mother what business she had to take in any body to lodge there; the mother desired her to make no noise for she should pay well for sleeping here: the daughter came to the bed side, and said, I should not lay any longer, and said it was the custom of that house, that whoever lay there should pay two shillings for gin, and she took my pockets from me, and insisted on having the contents, and she took from my pocket eleven shillings and some halfpence; she then brought the glass and the gin, and insisted I should drink; I would not, but she made me drink it because I was afraid of her; then she forced me by holding my shoulder and made me drink a second glass, which intoxicated me; then she took my bundle away and returned again in a few minutes without the bundle, and then told me to go about my business; the old prisoner was much in liquor; she was present. I asked her for my bundle; she swore I never brought any bundle there; she then gave the candle to her younger sister to light me down; she would not; then the prisoner took the candle and lighted me down: I said I would not go without my money and bundle; then she said, if I would not by fair means I should by foul means; she took me by the two shoulders and shoved me out of the room, and from thence out ofthe house; I asked the daughter to shew me into Holborn; she would not. I met two watchmen, and told them I had been robbed; they told me I was a woman of the town, and said I was a dirty hussey, and if I did not go about my business he would take me to the watch-house; I then met another watchman, I told him; he went with me to the house, but we could not find any thing of mine; then I saw Mr. Treadway, who searched the room, and found a cap, a black cloak, two handkerchiefs, and a cotton stocking.

             sworn.
I am a constable. On Saturday night last between two and three o'clock the watchman brought in the two prisoners; I went and searched with a candle, and broke open the door, and under a fish basket I found a black cloak in the ashes, this handkerchief under the bed, this cap and apron, this handkerchief in another corner of the room; I found nothing else. The prosecutrix was in liquor: she said the prisoners forced her to drink gin.
(The things produced and deposed to, the handkerchief marked A. G. the stockings marked with an A.)
How came the handkerchief to be marked A. G.? - Because I changed a handkerchief I had with a fellow servant at Chelsea, whose name was Ann Green.
Prisoners. We are innocent; we have no witnesses.

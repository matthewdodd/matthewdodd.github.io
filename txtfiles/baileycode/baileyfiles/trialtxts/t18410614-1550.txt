JOHN MARSHALL
. I live at Green-bank. On the evening of the 18th of May I went into the prosecutor's shop—while standing there two gentlemen gave an alarm that a man had stolen an umbrella from inside the doorway, and gone over London-bridge—I went round the back way of the premises, and coming through Crooked-lane, at the corner of Arthur-street West, I overtook the prisoner with an umbrella on his shoulder—I

collared him—he struck me, resisted, and attempted to run away-called the police, and gave him into custody with the umbrella.

Prisoner. I had it under my arm. Witness. You had it on your shoulder.





JOHN NORTON
 (City police-constable, No. 532.) I was on duty in King William-street, at the end of Crooked-lane—a gentleman came up and gave me information, and pointed the prisoner out—I went after him—Marshall had then got up to him, and I took him into custody.





EDWIN PEGG
. I am foreman to William Fisher, who has a shop is King William-street, five or six doors from Arthur-street—this umbrella is his property, and was taken from a rack inside the door.




GUILTY

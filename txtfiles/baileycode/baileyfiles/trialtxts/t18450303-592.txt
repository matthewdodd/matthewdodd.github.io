CHARLES BROWN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of March, 1 saw, value 5s., the goods of 



William Ware: and 1 saw, value 5s.; the goods of 



John Pearce Harlow.






JOHN PEARCE HARLOW
. I am a carpenter, and live in Philip-street, Kingsland-road—I was at work at 76, Cornhill, with Mr. Ware, on the 3rd of March—I went to dinner at five minutes to twelve, leaving my law on the bench—I returned about ten minutes past one, and found it in the policeman's hands—this is it.





CHARLES PILGRIM DARK ARCHER
. I was at work at Mr. Kennedy's Royal Exchange. In passing down Cornhill, I saw the prisoner on the other side of the way, and suspecting him, I watched and saw him go into No. 76, Cornhill—I looked and could see no policeman—in two or three minutes he came to the window with the saws in his hand—seeing me he put them under his coat, buttoned it up, and came out—I took him in the street, and he put the two saws down by the George and Vulture.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell the Lord Mayor you did not see me go into the house? A. I did not.






WILLIAM KNOWLES
 (policeman.) I produce the saws—I saw the prisoner put them down by the George and Vulture.

Prisoner's Defence. I am a house-painter; I have a wife and six children, who were in great distress.




GUILTY
.* Aged 42.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Baron Parke.

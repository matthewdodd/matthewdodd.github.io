My box was broke open, he slept in the house only five nights; I cannot tell when my box was broke, I was at my box the 4th of September, and I found then what I wanted, and on the 11th I made a thorough search, and missed the things in the indictment.

 slept in the same room with me when he slept there; I believe he slept there three or four nights, the landlord says five. I had a search warrant on Monday the 12th, and found him at No. 9, Pye-street, Westminster: I found one pair of silk stockings there, and I found the prisoner in the room, he said he was there quartered; the things were hung up on a line, I gave them to the constable, Moore. and he has kept them ever since. I found some other things at the pawnbrokers, who are here. He told me he had sold one of the shirts to a man. I told him if he would own to the things I would shew him what favour I could.

I am constable of St. Martin's: on the 12th of September, about three o'clock, Mr. Matthews brought me the warrant to go to Pye-street. I searched the apartments, and found a pair of silk stockings hanging wet on the line; I found nothing more there, but, after I had taken him, I searched his pockets, and found seven duplicates, two of them of some of the same property, and two others of Mr. Matthews's pledging. I went round to the pawnbrokers, to bring them forward to the examination, and then he was committed.

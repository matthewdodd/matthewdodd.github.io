            . I live at the Three Crowns in Whitechapel


. The Prisoner, with another Man, was drinking this Day at my House, and 
               
                  Martha 
                  Mathews 
               



             she was part of the Time with him; this was on the Friday, and I heard about the Tankard on Sunday; and the Means of the Discovery was this: The Prisoner met 
               
                  Meyer 
                  Joseph 
               



            , and offered him the Handle of a Silver Tankard; Joseph, upon this, was jealous it was stole, and secured him; afterwards the Remainder of the Tankard, very much bruised, was found buried on Whitechapel-Mount; Mathews the Prisoner discovered the other part of the Tankard, &c.

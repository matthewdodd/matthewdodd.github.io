            . I am a bookseller
. I was in Piccadilly


 about nine o'clock in the evening on the 4th of August; I felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner close to me; he dropped my handkerchief immediately, and I took him - I do not think there was any one with him.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was rather dark? A. Not at that time; his hand was close to my pocket, and I saw the handkerchief drop from his hand - he could not have not away from me.
JURY to MR. CREW. Q. Was there any person near you? A. No one so near as the prisoner, and I saw the handkerchief drop from his hand; I felt it drawn from me - it was impossible for any other person to do it.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have had the handkerchief ever since.

 in Aldgate


 parish. On the 15th instant, the prisoner and another man were drinking in my house; a stone bottle with six quarts of brandy, was standing under the table where they sat; I missed it; the prisoner was gone out; when he came in again, I asked him if he had seen it; he said, no; he said, if you have lost it you may go look for it; about eleven o'clock the next day, the prisoner's little boy was so drunk he could not stand; I asked him what he had been drinking; he said he had been drinking brandy out of a bottle that his mother had given him; I sent an officer to his house; he went and brought the bottle; (produced and deposed to) there was a small quantity of brandy left in it.

            . I had a warrant to search the prisoner's house; I went between eight and nine on the 16th instant; I found this bottle, with about a quart of brandy in it.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

             sworn.
On the 9th of April last I lost my watch, between twelve and one at noon, between the Turk's Head bagnio


 and Northumberland-house


, just facing Johnson's-court in the Strand; I was coming with a chair on my head, when I was passing Johnson's-court, I was pushed about for a considerable time by several men, it was the time the man was standing in the pilory; a man was coming past with a load upon his head, and they pushed me against this man, and I thought I felt my watch slip out of my pocket; I immediately put my hand down and missed my watch; I saw it in the prisoner's hand, I am sure of that; I then quitted my chair and got hold of one of his arms, I immediately saw a watch in another man's hand, I did not see him give it to the other man, but I saw it first in the prisoner's hand; I immediately seized the watch in the other man's hand, and in struggling broke the chain, he had the watch, and I had the chain; then I got hold of that man, and held him fast; and I immediately saw the prisoner, and said, he was the man; he was just standing by me, he was then in the custody of one Bruce, but I did not know it till afterwards, I am sure the prisoner was the man, I am very positive of it; he was taken into custody, and was committed; it began in hustling me about; I was afraid they would push me down with my chair.
Court. Was this shoving arising from the great croud and concourse of people, or on purpose? - It appeared to me to be on purpose.
Was there any thing like a blow struck, before the watch was taken? - Not before the watch was taken, I do not remember there was any violent blow, only pushing and hustling from one to another.
What it that kind of hustling that arises from a croud; or did any particular person appear to be pushing you? - I cannot say that I took any particular notice of what any one man did more than another.

             sworn.
I am an officer of the parish of St. Martin's, I was there on my duty; I heard a great rush; I went out to see what was the matter and I found the prosecutor had lost his watch, they was struggling for the watch, Sir 
               
                  Robert
                   Taylor
               



             was at a window at the Stationer's, he beckoned to me, I took him in custody after the affray was over.

             sworn.
On the 9th of April, I was standing at Charing Cross, looking at the man in the pilory, and the prosecutor was coming by with a chair on his head, and another man with a box on his head, they were intangled together looking down, I saw the prisoner's left elbow against the prosecutor's right-side, and I saw him take the watch out of his pocket and convey it to the other person, I never took my eyes off the person till I overtook him.
Did you observe a moment or two before the taking of the watch any conduct in the prisoner and the people about there? - There were a great many people round about.
Did you observe any particular violence used to Lucas? - No more than they were at his right-side, I did not see any blow given, I saw no particular ill-usage, I never had my eye off the prisoner after he took it.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I have nothing to say, I have no friend in the world, this soldier said when he was at the Justice's, that he was close to the gentleman, but did not see my hands there, I was searched, I had a knife and three halfpence in my pocket.
Jury. How do you get your bread? - I sell things with a jack-ass

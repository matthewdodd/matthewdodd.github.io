            . On the 29th of February, I was going to throw some stuff away backwards, and I saw something creeping along out of the front room, which I at first thought was a dog, but it was the prisoner, and I saw something under his arm; I caught him by the collar, and we fell in the street together; there was another man picked somethingup which fell out of the prisoner's hat, and ran off with it. These things fell from the prisoner's person.

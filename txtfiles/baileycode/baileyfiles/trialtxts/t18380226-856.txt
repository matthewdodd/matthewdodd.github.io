WILLIAM RYAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of February, 1 copper boiler, value 15s., the goods of 



Joseph William Appleyard.






GEORGE WADDINGTON
. I am an officer. On the afternoon of Monday, the 19th of February, I met the prisoner, with two others, in Bath-street, carrying this boiler, full a mile and a half from the prosecutor's—I asked where they were going—one of the others said, "I am going to this one's father's (meaning the prisoner) to see what he will give for it"—I then took the prisoner and the boiler—they said they were going to Brook's-market—I said they were going away from it, and I would take them;—I told the elder one to follow me, which I thought he would, but he went off—I knew him well before.





JOSEPH WILLIAM APPLEYARD
. This boiler is mine—it was in a cottage of mine in Albion-fields, Maiden-lane—I saw it secure on the Friday, and on Monday, the 19th, I found the place had been broken, and the boiler and several other things gone—the other things have not been found—I had fastened the place up with a padlock, and it had been forced off the door.




GUILTY.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I keep a publick house

 in Whitechapel



; the Prisoner came and called for a pint of beer, and while I was gone up stairs, he took a bag of halfpence out of a cupboard, and a man, who was in the house, and saw the Prisoner take it, called me down, for fear he should be blamed. He asked me, whether I missed any thing; I looked round about, and did not miss any thing; he bid me look in the cupboard, and when I looked there, I missed a bag of halfpence, in which were six shillings and eight pence halfpenny; he brought a punch bowl to my house the Friday before, which he had stole from another place, and I gave him a shilling for it.
Q. Did you take the Prisoner immediately upon this?
Inglish. I took him immediately, he never was out of my house.
Edward Wall. I am a Headborough; I was sent for to Mr. Inglish's house, and charged with the Prisoner for robbing him of a bag of half-pence, which I have here; I asked him how he came by them; he said, he took them out of a cupboard in Inglish's house.

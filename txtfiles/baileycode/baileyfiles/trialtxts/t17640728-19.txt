            . I am a ship-builder
. On the 11th of this instant, the day after I was burnt out, I was called down to New-crane-stairs, and was told a man had got a bag of nails out of my yard: there was a boat lying close to the stairs, and the prisoner and a bag of nails were in it; I know the bag to be my property, and the nails I have no doubt about; they are nails that had been burnt in the fire, and such I missed out of my counting house, and found it broke. I asked him how he got them out of my counting-house? he said, he ran after a man that had them, and he got away and left them.

            . I am a waterman. I was called out, and told a man was stealing coals out of a barge: I went and saw the prisoner standing up, with a bag; I felt the bag, and found it to be full of nails; a young fellow had stopped him, and he was standing by a boat; I do not know whose boat it was: it was taken up a-drift. I sent for the gentleman, and when we got the prisoner up into the street, he said he got the nails from another man: he and the nails were very wet, which must be by his coming out of the yard under shore.
The prisoner in his defence said, he got so wet by going into the water, to look for an our that he said was lost.

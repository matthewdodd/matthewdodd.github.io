            . On the 5th of July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Carlisle-street, Soho


, and felt somebody at my left-hand pocket, in which was my handkerchief and pocket-book. I turned round, and saw the two prisoners immediately behind me; no other person was within three or four yards of me. I collared them both, and found my pocket handkerchief between the coat and waistcoat of Ward.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners and the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
WARD'S Defence. I was passing the square, and saw the handkerchief lying against the rails - I took it up, and put it into my breast; the gentleman came and asked me for it, and I gave it to him directly.
PALMER'S Defence. I saw the officer and the gentleman lay hold of him, and when I came up he took me. I know no more of this young man than a stranger.

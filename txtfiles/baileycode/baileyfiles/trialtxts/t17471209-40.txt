            . I was coming along the Strand


 upon the 14th of November between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, two women stood at the corner of a court near the New Church they said, countryman! I stopt, and ask'd them what they had to say to me; they directly laid hold of me, and bid me come to the end of the alley, and that I need not be afraid. no-body would hurt me. I stept to the end of the alley, and ask'd them what business they had with me; they ask'd me for a dish of tea: I said I had no such thing: then they ask'd me for a dram; I said I must go about my business; then they took me by the colar and pull'd me down; I clapt my hand to my coat-pocket to secure my money; then they endeavour'd to pull me down; I took my hand out of my pocket to defend myself, and I found 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  White 
               



            's hand in my pocket, and the other had hold of my colar at the same time; she took her hand out of my pocket, and I found immediately my money was gone, and I said I am robb'd. White went away, and the other had hold of me, and when I would have gone, she d - d me, and would not let me go: It struck such a terror upon me, I did not know whether she would cut my throat, or what. I broke from the other woman and followed 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  White 
               



            ; and I told a man in the Strand that I was robb'd, and he told me of a Justice in the neighbourhood, that I might go to; I kept with White, and the other followed me for some time; at last she left me, and brought in a little time five or six men, the first, like a soldier, run his head against me; and another, like a gentleman, said he was a Constable, and if I would not let the woman go he would knock me down, which he did: but I would not quit her; then another knock'd me down. I was knock'd down three times, then they took them both away; then they drew me towards the end of the alley, and said they would knock me or any body else down that offered to come after them. There was a gentleman said to me, I know a house where a gang of very bad people use, where I will go with you, and do you justice: as soon as I came in I saw Willis, and charg'd a Constable with her, and we had her before the justice, and he committed her: I came to town to prefer an indictment against Willis, and I heard the other was in New Prison, and I am positively sure she is the woman that assaulted me: I have no farther to say.

            . Ask him whether there were not two women he ran after up the court?
Q. Do you usually carry money in your coat-pocket?
Lasebee. I usually carry it there, because my breeches pocket was bad; I was carrying that money to my sister in St. Katharine's, who is married; her name is 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jugam

                  Frazier 
               



            . I am a weaver by trade; I was coming towards the New Church in the Strand, and heard Lasebee cry out for help: he said, I have lost 16 s. When I went up to him the two Prisoners were three or four yards off; we seized White, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Willis 
               



             was scolding at us for holding White; I had hold of White with one arm and the Countryman another; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Willis 
               



             was very willing to go up Katharine-street, and she said that was the way to Justice Burdus; as we were up the street we miss'd Willis a little while: in a little time five or six men came up; we that came was a soldier, he run his head against him; and another came up and said he should let her go; if he did not, he would knock him down, which they did two or three times, and after they had releast the Prisoner they went up Katharine-street; I watched them into a house and I went back to the Country-man again, and a gentleman at an oil-shop offered to assist him; I told him where they were gone, and the Gentleman went with the Countryman to an ale-house, and there we found Willis and took hold of her.
Q. Are you sure White is the woman you had hold of with the Country-man first?
Frazier. Yes, I saw her last week in New Prison.


                  Tho 
                  Richardson 
               



            . Between St. Katharine-street and the New Church these two men had hold of her, White the Prisoner and Willis collar'd the Countryman; I heard him say he was robb'd and his collar was all tore: as they were carrying 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  White 
               



             before the Justice, there came up a soldier and run against the Countryman, and presently some more fellows came up and struck him several times and made his head bleed; after this the Countryman and the other Witness went to this house in the court in little Katharine-street, and there we found Willis the Prisoner.

            . I was opposite Little Katharine-street. and I heard a noise, and they said

                   Page


             had robb'd a man and she was gone before Justice Burdus.

Q. Do you know White?
Indd. Yes, five or six years; she lives in Drury-lane.
Q. Do you know who keeps this house in Little Drury-lane?
Indd. Their names are Smith; Willis has lodg'd there these two years. One of the Prisoners goes by the name of May, and the other by the name of Page.

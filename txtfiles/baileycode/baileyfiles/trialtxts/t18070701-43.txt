            ; it is a general home for us both. The property of this house belongs to all the partners.
Q. The prisoner at the bar has been your servant
. - A. Yes, upwards of three years.
Q. Did you go to Mr. Watson, and did you see some of your property there. - A. I went to Mr. Watson's. and I afterward went to Mr. Purse, a pawnbroker in London Wall, and there Mr. Mill, the clerk, shewed me eight pieces of shawl belonging to our firm; I had no doubt of their being our property; the names were on the shawls in full length; he had not taken the precaution of taking the names off.
Q. Did you see after that any piece of British calico. A. I saw one piece; the officer brought it down stairs from the room in which he lodged, and two single shawls. In consequence of selling the goods at Mr. Purse's, I went to the mansion house; the officer took the prisoner in our counting house.
Q. Do you happen to know what parish this house is in. - A. I believe it is in the parish of St. Lawrence Jewry; I do not positively know.

            . Q. I understand you are a shopman to Mr. Purse, who is a pawnbroker in London Wall. - A. Yes.
Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do; I have known him ten months, by his bringing goods to me, shawls and a few cottons. I went to Mr. Peel myself, and shewed him eight pieces of shawls, which I got of the prisoner; he brought them at four different times.
Q. How lately had any been brought to you. - A. On the 17th or 18th of May; he then brought two pieces.
Q. Did you shew to Mr. Peel these two pieces that were brought on the 17th or the 18th. - A. Yes, they are part of the eight pieces that were shewn to Mr. Peel; Mr. Peel claimed them as his own; I have got them here, but they are so much alike I cannot distinguish them, they are of two patterns; I produce the eight pieces; I took in six of them myself.
Q. You say only two pieces were brought on the 17th or 18th of May - were you present when they were brought, and did you take in the goods on that day. - A. I did not; we did not see the shawls then.
Q. Do you advance money on goods without looking at them. - A. No; he said he would leave the goods and call again.

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes.
Q. Did you take in any shawls of him. - A. I believe I have, once or twice.
Q. Did you take in any of him on the 17th or 18th of May. - A. I cannot say; I do not know whether I took in any myself.
Court. Were you present when he brought in any goods. - A. Yes.
Q. When was the latest time that you see him bring in any goods. - A. I cannot say.
Q. How did you receive these goods. - A. They were packed up in paper; I never bought any.
Q. Who bought them. - A. This young man and another young man that lived with us.
Q. to Mill. Did you pay him any money for them A. Yes, I did.
Q. Which shawls did you pay him for. - A. Those that have been sold some time ago.
Q. Were these a sample of any thing that you did buy. - A. They were samples of what I were to buy.
Q. When did you open any of these shawls that are now here in the presence of the prisoner. - A. Some of these pieces of shawls which I can point out.
Q. You say they were brought on the 17th or 18th of May did you see the prisoner after that. - A. I saw him on the 19th
Q. Was Mr. Purse present. - A. No
Mr. Knapp. Upon what occasion did you see him on the 19th of May. - A. He called in to let me know that he had a quantity of goods for me to look at in Lawrence lane; we conversed about the goods that were brought on the 18th; I offered him one pound ten shilling, a dozen for the shawls; after some hesitation he agreed to take it; I was to pay him for them when he brought the thirty dozen. On the 19th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening I went to Mr. Peel's, Lawrence-lane; I rung at the bell, and the prisoner opened the door, and told me that he had looked out the goods for me; he took me into the warehouse, and shewed me about ten pieces of them; I asked him then if he was a partner in the house, he told me he was not, he was only a warehouseman; I then asked him whose goods they were, he told me that they were Mr. Peel's; I asked him whether Mr. Peel knew I was buying these goods, or of his selling them; he said he did not know it; I told him he was doing very wrong in selling Mr. Peel's goods without his knowledge; he then told me I might have any goods I saw in the warehouse, to the amount of several thousands worth; I might pick them out, and he would sell them me; I told him I would have nothing to do with the shawls, as they were not his own. I gave information to Mr. Watson, who formerly belonged to Mr. Peel's house.

            . Q. You are a constable of the city of London. - A. Yes; on the 20th of May I took the prisoner in custody, in Mr. Peel's accompting house; I went to No 58, White Lion-street, to the prisoner's lodgings, he directed me; there we found two shawls in his chest of drawers, in the one pair of stairs room; and in his bed room in Mr. Peele's house, I found this piece of printed cotton.
(The property produced and identified.)
Q. (to Mr. Peel) Since you have made this charge, have you taken stock, and do you find a diminution of that stock since the apprehension of the prisoner. - A. Yes.
The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character,
GUILTY, aged 24.

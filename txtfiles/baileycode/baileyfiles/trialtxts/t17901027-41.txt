. I know the prisoner Johnson; she had been my servant; she had been discharged some time before, and staid to attend my sick father, and she robbed him; the things were kept in a box in my father's room, which was locked; I saw them about five or six months ago, when my father was taken to his bed; I locked them up in the box in the prisoner Johnson's presence; when I missed the things, the prisoner Johnson was at the other prisoner's; I told her it would be better for her to confess; and when the constable threatened to search her, she delivered to me two duplicates of a watch and a pair of buckles, and a gold ring, part of

             the constable; I can swear to the ring by two letters, E. H.

I am the officer. On the 18th of September, Mr. Lockey sent for me; he gave charge of Johnson, who was in the bar; and she produced two duplicates of a silver watch and a pair of silver buckles.
Prisoner Johnson. I have nothing to say.
Prisoner Marsley. Sir, I am not guilty; I did not know it to be stolen.

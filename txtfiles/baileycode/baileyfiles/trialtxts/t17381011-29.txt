Ann Birch. My Husband dy'd on the 12th Day of last Month; I took the Prisoner to help me in the House as a Chair-Woman
, and she robbed me of what I had, and left me sick in Bed. She took away with her a Mourning Gown, a Shift, a blue Apron, two Handkerchiefs, a Cap, and a Hat, and a Pair of Gloves. The Hat and Cap were found upon her Head, and were taken from her. When she was carry'd before my Lord Mayor, she would own nothing; but when she was in the Compter, she confessed to me that she took my Goods, and was sorry for what she had done. Some of which (she told me) she had pawn'd, the rest she had sold; I have had none of them again. I lost my Husband on Tuesday, I bury'd him on Friday, and she stripp'd me of my Goods on Saturday. 


               Guilty 10 d.

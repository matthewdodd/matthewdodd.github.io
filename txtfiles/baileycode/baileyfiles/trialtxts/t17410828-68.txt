 under pretence of borrowing a handsaw, and found means to carry off an iron crow. He was apprehended, and when I charged him with it before the Justice, he own'd the taking it, and said he had sold it to one

            . The Prisoner came to my master Mr. Mount's shop, and desired me to lend him a handsaw. I told him I could not lend any such thing, and he went away; and came again presently and said he would take it. I saw him carry something out, but what it was I can't tell.

The Jury found the Prisoner 

               guilty
            .

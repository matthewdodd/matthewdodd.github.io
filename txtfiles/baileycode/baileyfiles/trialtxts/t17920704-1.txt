; I keep house there; on the 21st of May, at night, my house was broke open; I went to bed at eleven, and fastened every shutter and door and window myself, before I went to bed; I was not alarmed till I rose at six, and I found the back kitchen window shutter broke, and a strange tinder box, and bunch of matches and flint, and every thing to strike a light; I went into the other kitchen and found the door open, and the sheets were gone from the horse, and the tea chest, and the dresser drawer, where the linnen was, and the things gone; part of them have been in possession of the constable, Whitman; I did not know the prisoner before.

Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Was there light enough to discover a man's countenance? - Yes.
After day break was it? - Yes, some time after day break, about half past three o'clock.

I am a labourer, at Islington; I saw these two young men and another, in company, jump over a bank and run away, about 200 yards from Mrs. Farrer's house; I did not see whether they had any thing with them; they sat on the bank to drink a bottle of beer; I found a bottle there afterwards; this was about five minutes before three, as near as I can tell.
Was it light then? - Yes; then they went to the bottom of the hill; then I saw two of them with bundles, the other had not, and I went after them to Mrs. Harrison's, and told the watchman; he followed them, and I went away; I work at the lead mill at Islington; I was at club that morning till near two o'clock.
Mr. Garrow. Had you been drinking? - Yes.
Pretty much in liquor? - No, I was not in liqour at all.

            . I live in Mulberry-street, Commercial-road; my husband
 is a labourer at Messrs. Croft and Evans's
. Between one and two o'clock last Saturday I was going to market in Union-street, Whitechapel


; I stopped to see a show, and had not been there two minutes before a gentleman touched me on the shoulder, and said my pocket had been picked - I felt, and my box was gone. I had not observed the prisoner near me, but he was laid hold of, and the box found in his hand - my half sovereign was in it.

            . I am a coachman. I saw Elliott in Union-street, looking at some monkies - I saw the prisoner take his hand out of her pocket: I woman came and abused me for it. I took hold of him, and he had the box in his hand; Elliott claimed it. I took him to the office.

            . I am a farmer
, and live at Uxbridge. On the 20th of April, I lost my coat from No. 9, Castle-street, Holborn


; it hung in the passage at eleven o'clock; I returned at three o'clock, and it was gone; it is a private house.

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of April, about a quarter past one o'clock, I was in Broad-street, Carnaby-market, and saw the prisoner cross and go up Hopkins-street, with the great-coat under his arm. I followed and saw him putting it on over his own coat. A lad went up and spoke to him. He then pulled it off and put it under his arm again. I called for Dawes and we secured him. He said he had it to mend for a man, and would take us to the place. He took us to a Jew's, who is a dealer in marine-stores, in Crown-court. The man denied giving him the coat. I advertized it, and Mr. James claimed it. (Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I bought it in Holborn.

               Transported for Seven Years

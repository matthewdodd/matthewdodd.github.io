            . Last Tuesday was a week, coming down Cheapside


, seeing several people round the Mansion house, I stopped to see what was the reason of it; Mr. Pain detected the prisoner in picking my pocket; I saw him take my handkerchief from the prisoner's breeches.

            . I was at the Mansion-house gate, I saw the prosecutor looking in; the prisoner came to his right side pocket; his pocket lid was in, so that the handkerchief appeared: I saw the prisoner put his hand in and take it out, I could not tell where he put it: I said to the prosecutor, you have been robbed; I laid hold of the prisoner, and saw the corner of the handkerchief hang out of his breeches; I took it out; (produced and deposed to.)

Prisoner's defence.
I was going to Greenwich; I stopped at the Mansion-house, and saw this handkerchief lying on the ground; before I could turn about, they laid hold of me.

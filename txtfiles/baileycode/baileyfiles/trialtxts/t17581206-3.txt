            . I am a goldsmith; the prisoner brought this mug to me sell, between 3 and 4 o'clock last Wednesday. I asked her how she came by it; she said he had kept that house, the 3 Bee-Hives, about four years ago, and she had kept it since for her own use. I seeing engrav'd on it, 
               
                  John 
                  Fleet 
               



            , at the three Bee-Hives and Pig, Honey-Lane-Market, I stopt it, and sent for him; he had not missed it 'till I sent for him.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

            . I am a muslin manufacturer
, and live in Watling-street. On the 16th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Wych-street


; A person came up, and said my pocket had been picked. I immediately missed my handkerchief, which Thompson produced - he had the prisoner in custody.

THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. I was in Wych-street, and saw Mr. Lowndes there, and the prisoner and another in company following him. I watched them about 150 yards - the other appeared most active; the prisoner was covering him. The other took something out of the prosecutor's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner, who concealed it in his bosom. I seized him, and took the handkerchief out, and sent a person to inform Mr. Lowndes - he claimed it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoner following Mr. Lowndes. A signal passed between them, and the handkerchief was taken.
Prisoner. It is my first offence.

            . I live in Hackney-road. On the 2nd of March the prisoner brought two rabbits, and wanted me to purchase them; by the price at which he offered them, I thought he had stolen them; I asked him where he lived, he said against the New church, Hoxton: I said before I paid for them, it was my rule to go and see where people lived - he said what business had I with it; I said, "If you don't let me, I shall give you in charge," which I did, and the rabbits were detained.

GEORGE WETHERALL
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 breast-pin, value 20s., the goods of 



William Randall Prior, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







WILLIAM RANDALL PRIOR
. I live with my father in Marchmont-street, Russell-square. About ten o'clock on Thursday night, the 25th of April, "I was with my brother in Regent-street—the prisoner came before me, placed his hat before my face, and took the pin from my breast—I am sure it was him—I collared him—I cannot tell what became of the pin—I believe there was a man with him—I am quite sure I had my pin—I had seen it an hour before.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Was any one close by him at the time? A. Yes—I cannot say how many there were.





ASHEN PRIOR
. I live with my father, an ironmonger, in Marchmont-street. About ten o'clock, on the 25th of April, I was walking in Regent-street with my brother—I saw the prisoner's hat over my brother's eyes, and his hand above his head—my brother caught him directly, and thrust him into a door-way—I can swear my brother had the pin a minute before—there was another man in company with the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. Was any one near you? A. Yes, a great many persons round about.





JONATHAN RACKMAN
 (police-constable T 219.) I took the prisoner—he said he was a gentleman.





THOMAS GROVER
 (police-constable L 160.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

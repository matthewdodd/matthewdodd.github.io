            . I lost the things mentioned in the indictment out of my shops little after six o'clock; as I was sitting behind my shop, I heard one of my apprentices cry out, stop thief! upon which I ran out, and found they had taken the prisoner.

            . I am a butcher. I heard the cry of stop thief! I stopt the prisoner with the bundle of stocking under his arm.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Grammer: I was in the shop; the prisoner came into the shop, snatched the paper of stockings off the counter, and ran away; I raised a cry of stop thief! upon which the prisoner was pursued and was taken by Mr. Murdock, when the dropt the stockings.
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked them up.
He called Roberts, who said he was a hairdresser; that he was out of employment, and had enlisted in the army; that he had known the prisoner a great while; that he was passing at the time, and saw him stoop and picked up the stocking very leisurely one after another; that he heard no cry of stop thief, nor saw any particular hurry in the street; that he was acquainted with him; but and not speak to him at the time, because he was in a hurry.

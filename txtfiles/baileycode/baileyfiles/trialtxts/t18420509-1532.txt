1532. 




JOHN MOSES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of April, I box, value 1s.; and 28lbs. weight of bee's wax, value 1l. 6s.; the goods of 



John Clemmett.






JOHN CLEMMETT
. I lost a box containing 28lbs. of bee's wax, on the 21st of April, from the neighbourhood of Fenchurch-street—this is the box.





HENRY JONES
. I am a town carman. On the 21st of April, about a quarter past one o'clock, I was near the cart-stand in Crutched-friars—I saw the prisoner and two others—the prisoner was carrying this box—I went and asked him where he got it—he said a gentleman asked him to carry it for him—I collared him, and he let the box down—the other two ran away.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did you know the other two persons. A. I know them all three to be thieves—I did not know where to find the prisoner—I had seen him with the others, perhaps fifty times or more—I live in Ashley-terrace, City-road, but the cart-stand where I was is in Crutched-friars—I have never seen the other persona charged with any thing.





WILLIAM PREADY
. I am in the prosecutor's service, at Clement's-inn, Old Bailey. On the 21st of April, I was in Fenchurch-street—I had the box of bee's wax in the cart—I went up a court to deliver a hamper, and in about two minutes I was coming back to my cart, and found the box was gone—this is it.
(Sarah Russell, the wife of Joseph Russell, an upholsterer, in Bow-street, Covent-garden, gave the prisoner a good character.)

             sworn.
I am shopman to Mr. Dollard, a neighbour to Mr. Foster; I saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief through the glass of the prosecutor's shop, in St. Paul's church yard


; his shop joins to mine; there were four by at the time the glass was cracked; I cannot tell whether there was a hole in the glass; I directly came down stairs, and caught the prisoner as he was going off, and brought him into the shop; the others got off; he was was about a dozen yards from the window, going towards the rails of St. Paul's, and he left another at the window at the same time; I found the handkerchief upon him; he was afterwards taken to the Compter; I took him into Mr. Foster's shop; he denied first he had the handkerchief; afterwards he said he would produce it, and I saw him take it out of his coat; Mr. Foster and all the shopmen are quakers; I am sure I saw him draw it from the shop window; the prisoner said a boy gave it him as he was going along.
What does Mr. Foster deal in? - Shirts and handkerchiefs.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I picked up this handkerchief close to the door, as I came along.

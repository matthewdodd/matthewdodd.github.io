1926. 



SAMUEL MAGINN
 and 




WILLIAM SCALES
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 fire lump, value 2s. 3d.; and 1 brick, 2s. 3d.; the goods of 



John Cherry, the master of Scales, Scales having been before convicted of felony.






JOHN CHERRY.
 I am a carman, and live in Middle-row, Goswell-street—Scales was in my service—I have been employed by Messrs. Moreland to cart goods for them—I employed Scales on the 30th of July to cart some Welsh lumps and bricks for them.





JOHN CONNELL.
 On the 30th of July I saw a cart driven by Scales, stop in Ironmonger-row, Maginn took a lump out of the hinder part of the cart and took it into his own house—Scales was standing close by the cart.

Maginn. The lump was not found in my house—I was told to carry it into the house.





JOSEPH MORELAND.
 I have seen the lumps—I had them weighed and measured—they exactly correspond with I had, and which I employed Cherry to carry—they are mine.





JOHN CHERRY

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY.
Q. Were these lumps yours? A. No, they were Mr. Moreland's—they were never given to me—I never saw them.





CHARLES WOOLNER.
 (policeman 153 G.) I produce these six lumps which I found in Maginn's kitchen.





ANN JOHNSON.
 I occupy the bottom part of the house, No. 23, Ironmonger-row—these lumps were in the yard there, and they were taken down into the kitchen for Maginn.
(Peter Stevens, a house-agent, gave Maginn a good character.)





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-sergeant 20 G.) I produce a certificate of Scales' former conviction—(read—Convicted Dec., 1844, and confined fourteen days solitary)—he is the person.

MAGINN—


GUILTY.


SCALES—

Transported for Seven Years.

OWEN JONES. I live in Greenhill's-rents


 - I occupy the front room on the first floor, and the prisoner (who is my son), lodged in the back-room, on the same floor - he is a brush-maker
 by trade. I missed my coat on the 29th of December; I never allowed him to pawn any of these articles, nor did I know they were pawned.

On the 31st of January my father gave me leave to go into my brother's room - I found twenty-six duplicates in a glove, which related to my father's property, which had been missed at different times - I found one for my father's coat, which had been pawned on the 26th of December; there was a duplicate of a sheet, a table-cloth, a gown, and many other articles.

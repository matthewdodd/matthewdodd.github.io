                  Perkins
               



            , and 
               
                  Adam 
                  Lyn
               



            , of the Parish of St. Martins in the Fields



, were Indicted for 


               Felony and Burglary, for breaking the House of 
                     
                        Nathan 
                        Wilcox
                     




                   on the 6th of August
 last, between Two and Three in the Night, and taking thence a silk Gown, two stuff Gowns, two stuff Petticoats, a pair of Buckles set with stones, a Sable Tippet, a silver Salt, and divers other Goods
            . The Prosecutor deposed, That Perkins was his Servant
, and did let in a Man into the House, as he did suppose, and went away with the Goods, but upon enquiry heard she was gone to Bristol; he sent after her, where she was taken with some of the Goods upon her. She said that she had nothing to say for her self, but would throw her self upon the Mercy of the Bench; the Jury thereupon found her 


               guilty of Felony, and acquitted her of the Burglary
            . As for Lyn, he proved himself to be in his Bed the Night the Fact was committed; the Jury thereupon 

               acquitted
             him.

            . I am a cabinet-maker
, and live in Old Nicholl-street, Bethnal-green. On the 1st of August, about half-past one in the morning, I was in Shoreditch


. I was very tired, and fell asleep on a step. I was quite sober, I was awoke by feeling somebody at my neck, jumped up, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting my neck-handkerchief into her bosom. I seized her, and took it from her. I found my coat-pockets turned out, she cried out Murder! and I was surrounded by about a dozen men, who struck me, and told me to let her go. I held her till the watchman took her. They then made off.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cryof watch, ran up, and found a dozen or more round the prosecutor, who was holding the prisoner. He gave charge of her, and gave the account he has now.
Prisoner's Defence. He took me home, and gave me the handkerchief instead of money.
PIZZEY. It is false.

2518. 




JOSEPH COOK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of Au-gust, 4 live tame rabbits, price 6s., the property of 



Richard Wiffin; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD WIFFIN
. I am a wheelwright, and live at Camberwell—I seep rabbits in my yard and garden. On the 7th of August they were safe at nine o'clock at night—at five the next morning my wife awoke me, and I found three of my rabbits in a bag, and one had made his escape out of it—I knew the prisoner, and have often told him to keep away from my shop.





THOMAS WALTER PHINN
. I live next door to the prosecutor. On

the morning of the 7th of August, I was awoke about three o'clock—I went round the garden, but saw nothing—about four the dog began to bark—I got up, and saw the prisoner in the garden under the window—I unbolted the back-door, which disturbed him—he got through his mother's house, over several fences, and made away—I knew him before, and am sure he is the person—in searching about I found a sack in a neigh-bour's garden, with three rabbits in it, and one rabbit had got out of a hole in the sack, and was in the garden.

Prisoner. I had a blackbird, who got out of the cage, and I went after him—I did not touch the rabbits—nobody saw me touch any thing.





SAMUEL WRIGHT
 (police-constable P 172.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the clerk of the peace of Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years. (There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

            . I am a pawnbroker at the corner of Wood-street near Cripplegate; on the 14th of September, about eight in the evening, the prisoner brought a trunk into my shop, and wanted to borrow some money upon it; he told me his father gave fourteen shillings for it, and gave it him; I opened it, and saw Mr. Clement's name on it; I sent for him, he came and owned it (produced in court.)

            . This trunk is my property.
Mr. Manwaring. I live at Mr. Clements's; I fetched out the trunk to show to a customer, and put it in at the door again; when we came to take the things in it was gone.
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming along about eight o'clock by Mr. Clements's, I tumbled over this trunk; I knocked at the door, but nobody came, so I took it away.

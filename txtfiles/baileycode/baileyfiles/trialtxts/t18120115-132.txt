            . I am shopman to 
               
Mr.
 
                  Barnes
               



             in Cannon-street


, he is a pen and quill manufacturer
. On the 26th of December


 the defendant came to the shop, he said he came from Mr. Portman, Bell-alley, Lombard-street, for five hundred pens at four shillings per hundred; he then said he would take six dozen of black lead pencils, at half a crown a dozen, I delivered them to him with a bill of parcels, and entered them in the delivery book which he signed. This is the delivery book; I saw him sign it G. Smith. He brought these four hundred quills, he said we were toclarify them and send them home. I sent them home and discovered that this was not true. I afterwards saw him before the sitting Alderman in custody. I am sure he was the same person, he was taken up on another charge.

            . I am a stationer, 11, Bell-alley, Lombard-street. The defendant left my service about five months.
Q. Had he any authority from you to make application to Mr. Barnes. - A. No. I never gave him any authority, I was not at all accquainted with his having done that act until these quills were brought to me.
The defendant said nothing in his defence.

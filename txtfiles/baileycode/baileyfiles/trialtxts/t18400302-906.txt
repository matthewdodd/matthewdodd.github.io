MICHAEL ROACH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of February, at 

St. James, Clerkenwell, 2 coats, value 3l., and 12 pairs of trowsers, value 4l., the goods of 



Edward Willis, in his dwelling house: and that he bad been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD WILLIS
. I keep a sale-shop on Clerkenwell-green, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the 12th of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, this coat and trowsers were in my shop—my wife gave me information that a man had gone out with some goods—I went out with Chipperfield, down Back-hill—we both went, and took the prisoner at the bottom of the hill, with the clothes on his shoulder—they are well worth 7l.—I brought him back, and went for a policeman—the prisoner was a stranger to me.





JOHN CHIPPERFIELD
. I am a neighbour of the prosecutor's. I saw the prisoner come from the shop with the clothes across his shoulder—I ran out with the prosecutor, and pursued him—I took him myself with the property on him, about one hundred yards from the shop.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Clerken well-green, a man asked me to carry the clothes, he said he would give me some money, I thought it a good opportunity to get money as I wanted some—he walked by my side with them, and this man came and caught me.





WILLIAM GREEN
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness against him—he is the same person—he was sentenced to transportation.

Prisoner. I was guilty of that, but that is no reason why I should be guilty of this.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

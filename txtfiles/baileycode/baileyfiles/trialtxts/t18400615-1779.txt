JOHN ARCHER
(police-constable C150.) I was at Greenwich fair on the 10th of June, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner, and watched him for

about twenty minutes—I saw him attempt several person's pockets—I kept my eye on him, and saw him go behind a gentleman, and draw from his pocket this handkerchief, which I now produce—I seized him, and told the gentleman to come with me to the station-house—when he got about half-way, he said he would not go any further, and went away—I asked his name and address, he refused to give it.

            , the 8th of February
.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  John 
                  Pennel 
               



            .) What have you to say against the Prisoners?

Pennel. I was at the taking of 
               
                  James 
                  Bullock 
               



            , and as we were going along with him by Mr. Salway's, he said, that was the Place where he stole two Pair of Breeches from.
Court. Then he shew'd you the particular House where he stole them.
Pennel. Yes, where he and two more stole them.
Q. Whose were they?
Pennel. The Property of 
               
                  George 
                  Salway 
               



            ; and he said, had it not been for Dunock's being drunk, he should have got the whole Suit; but he being drunk, run against the Knocker of the Door, and the People came out and shut it.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Bullock.) Would you ask this Witness any Question?
Bullock. Please you, my Lord, what he speaks of I am innocent of; I never shew'd him the House.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  John 
                  Terry 
               



            .) What have you to say about this Matter that concerns Bullock?
Terry. I am an Officer; and as I was going along with Bullock from New-Prison, he call'd at the Taylor's House; he said, Madam, did not you lose two Pair of Breeches? The Gentlewoman said Yes. Said Bullock, I am the Man that stole them such a Time.
Q. Do you know any thing of the other two Prisoners?
Terry. No, but what the other, that is Bullock, said.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Bullock.) What have you to say for yourself?
Bullock. Please you, my Lord, I know nothing of what the Evidence says.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Bullock.) Have you any Witnesses?
Bullock. Not at present, my Lord.
As there was no other Evidence against Dormer and Dunock, they were 

               acquitted
            , but  Bullock was found 

               Guilty
            .

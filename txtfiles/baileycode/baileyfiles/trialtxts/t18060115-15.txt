             sworn. I live in Barbican


, I am a tailor and salesman
; on the 19th of December, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar and another woman lurking about the door, there was a man in the shop that I was attending to, I rather suspected them, seeing there was something that passed between the man and them; as soon as I saw them run off, I got a person to mind the shop, and I pursued them; I overtook the prisoner in Aldersgate-street, the other ran off, I took her cloak of one side, and found the waistcoat under her cloak in her apron, I knew the waistcoat to be mine.
Q. Where was this waistcoat taken from? - A. It was taken from the door, it was pinned a few inches within the door on a coat, and a string went over them both.
- TURNER sworn. I am a constable, I took the prisoner into custody, I produce the waistcoat.
Prosecutor. That waistcoat is mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Barbican, when I came to the corner of Aldersgate-street, I saw two women running along, they stopped at a court and dropped that waistcoat, I picked it up.

Q. (to prosecutor) What pace was she walking? - A. Very quick.
Q. Are you sure that she is one of the women that was walking up and down the street by your shop? - A. Positively that gave me the suspicion.

            . I have care of an empty house in Well-street, Hackney


, which belongs to Mr. John Atkinson; there was a copper set in it; I saw the prisoner on the 10th of October, at twenty minutes before one o'clock, carrying the copper out of the gate in front of the premises - I went and asked how he came by it; he said a gentleman gave it him to carry - but I did not see any person near there; the gate is about three yards from the house - I followed the prisoner, and took the copper from him; I have fitted it to the place, and have no doubt it came from there: I had not known the prisoner before - I do not know how he got in - but a back window-shutter had been forced open with a turn-buckle.

             I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and fitted the copper to the place where it had been fixed- it fitted exactly.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work, and went round to beg a bit of bread: a man stood at the gate, and asked me to carry this to Hackney-road, and said he would give me 1s.

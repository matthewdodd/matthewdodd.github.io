MR. AVELING. He should have given me the money directly he came home; I never received this - Mr. Harrison pays his bills every Wednesday, and as it had stood over two or three weeks, I said to the prisoner, "How is it, Mr. Harrison has not paid his bill?" he said he was out of town - I am certain he never paid me the money.

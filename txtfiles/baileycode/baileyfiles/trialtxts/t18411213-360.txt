HENRY BUTLER
 was indicted

14th of December, 50lbs. weight of coals, value 4d., the goods of 



Robert Pugh and another.






RICHARD MANEY
. I am one of the Thames Police-constables. Yesterday morning, at eleven o'clock, I was at the Fox-under-the-hill cause-way, and saw the prisoner, who is what we call a "shore-raker"—he was near the barge Charlotte, belonging to Robert Pugh and his son—I saw him reach up and take a quantity of coals from inside the barge, put them down into a cloth, tie it up, put it on his head, and come up the causeway—I stopped him when he came up—I asked where he got them—he said he picked them up out of the mud—I told him I had been watching him, and saw him take them.





OLIVER CARMICHAEL
. I am in the employ of Mr. Robert Pugh, who is in partnership with his son—the barge Charlotte belongs to them, and the coals in it.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in the dock; they dropped on the ground as they were pitching the sacks.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship. (The policeman stated that the prisoner had been several times summarily convicted of like offences.)

Before Mr. Justice Patteson.

            . I am a plaisterer
. I was making up some stuff, and my master bid me run after the Prisoner, for he said he had stole something. When I took him, I asked what made him do it; he said the devil put him upon it, or the devil was in him. He was very rebellious, and I was forced to give him a knock, and I took my hat from him.

            . I saw the Prisoner going along with something under his coat, and it was Tindal's hat. I asked him why he did not take the coat and all, he said he wished he had; said I, if you had you would have had a good dinner, for there was some bread and lamb in the pocket.

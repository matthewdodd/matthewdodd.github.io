JOHN GIBBS. On the 26th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Earl-street, Lisson-grove

Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Were there many people about? A. There was a crowd, but I was some distance from it.

            . I am an officer. I was called to assist in taking the prisoner; he was then in the Champion public-house.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you handcuff him? A. Yes- I generally do so, especially when I knew there were above forty thieves round; he escaped from me.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner ran away with the handcuffs on, and in two or three days I found him; he immediately said, "I know nothing about the seals and chain."

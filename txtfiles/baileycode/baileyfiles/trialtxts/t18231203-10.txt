            . I am a pupil of Guy's Hospital
, and lodge in Maze-pond, Borough. On the 10th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was by Blackfriars bridge


 - the Lord Mayor was returning from Westminster; I felt some halfpence jink in my waistcoat pocket - I immediately put my hand to my fob, and my watch was gone. I saw the prisoner with it in his hand, putting it into his pocket; the chain was hanging out of his pocket - I seized him, caught hold of the chain, and drew it from his hand; he said, "Now you have got your property let me go." I still kept my hold of him, and called for an officer, who came and took him. I produce the watch.

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house on this charge, and said, "I shall go from here to the Compter, from there to Newgate, and then to Botany." He escaped from me with the handcuffs on, but I took him again.
Prisoner's Defence. That man is a perjured rascal; is it likely I should state such a thing to an officer? I picked it up in the crowd.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.

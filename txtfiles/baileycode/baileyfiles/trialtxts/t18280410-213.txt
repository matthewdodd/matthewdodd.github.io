            . I am an officer. On the 28th of February, as I stood at the corner of Lloyd's-row, I saw the prisoner with a man, named Bateman, whom I know to be a receiver; while I was talking to Bateman the prisoner came up: Bateman called to him, "Farmer, Farmer;" I stopped him, and insisted that he should not say any thing- the prisoner went, and put down a cask at Bateman's door; I went to him, and said, "What did you leave that there for?" he said he lived with Mr. West, and that the dray was coming presently - I secured him.
JOB WEST. I am in partnership with James West; the prisoner was never in our employ - I never directed our dray to call at Bateman's - we have lost several casks.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was the prisoner with your drayman that day? A. No; my dray was out.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was with the man all day, and picked up this cask - I did not know it was Mr. West's; I did not know Bateman; I was going to take the cask to my lodgings, and thought I would go to the drayman next day, and give it him, as I used to go round with him.

 - the prisoner is my son. On the 19th of September he left home; I suspected he had taken something, and missed this coat from an adjoining room.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Lorton, a pawnbroker. I have a coat, which was pawned about three o'clock on the 19th of September, by the prisoner, for 10s.; he said he brought it for his father, who lived in Whitcomb-street - he had pawned things before, as we supposed, for his father.

            . This is my coat, and the only one I had; I had not allowed him to pawn it - I am sorry to say he had taken many things of mine, or I should not have taken the step I have; he is a very good boy at work.

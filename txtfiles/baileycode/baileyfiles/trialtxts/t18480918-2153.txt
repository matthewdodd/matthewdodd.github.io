On 23rd Aug., I and my wife were the last persons up—the cellar-flap was shut, but not fastened—at twelve o'clock I went to bed in the bar-parlour, as I had lost money before—I heard a noise, got up, opened the door, and saw the prisoner with a light in his hand—I kuew him; he had been in my house before, and he was there till ten o'clock the same night—I

was frightened, I thought he had a knife in his hand—I cried out twise "Murder!"—he ran down into the cellar—I ran into the yard; the cellar-flap was open; I put it down, and put a great stone on it—I then fetched an officer, who wont into the cellar, and the prisoner was gone—I went into the—yard, and he had forced the frame and all the flap open.

JOSMH CHAPLIN

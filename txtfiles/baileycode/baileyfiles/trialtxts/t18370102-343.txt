WILLIAM MADDOCK
. I am a carpenter. On Saturday, the 18th of December, between twelve and one o'clock in the day I was in Thread needle-street—I felt a snatch at my coat pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I turned round and saw the prisoner just behind me—he turned back and walked from me; and when he saw me coming towards him, he dropped the handkerchief and ran away—he was secured without my losing sight of him.





JAMES PYE
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner fling the handkerchief from behind him, from his right hand—he ran away, and I secured him.

Prisoners Defence. There were other people running before and behind me, crying "Stop thief," and I ran also—when I was brought back the gentleman had the handkerchief in his pocket.

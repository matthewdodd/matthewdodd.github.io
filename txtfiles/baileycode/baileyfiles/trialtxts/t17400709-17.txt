                  Green 
               



            . My House was broke open the last Day of May, and I lost off my Bed,3 Blankets, a Pair of Sheets, and a Quilt, about the Middle of the Day, between 10 and 12 o'Clock. When I went into the Room, I was surprised to see the Bed naked, knowing how I had left it, about an Hour, or an Hour and Half before. Lord bless me says I,- I have lost all my Bedding! And looking about, I saw a Pane of Glass broke, and the Bolt of the Window had been open'd. I was in the House the same Time, and wonder'd how it could be. When I found my Goods, they were in the next Witness's Possession.
A Witness. The last Day of May, the Prisoner brought me 2 Blankets, for which I gave her 6 Shillings. In less than 2 Hours I heard they were Part of Mrs Green's Goods: upon which I went after the Prisoner, and detain'd her; and sent for Mrs Green, and deliver'd the Goods to her.
Prisoner. I have sold China, and old Cloaths these 24 or 25 Years, and never sold any Thing yet, in my Life, which was not honestly come by.
Three Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest, industrious, Pains-taking Woman.

JOHN RICHARDS, alias
 Marrs,

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of May, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., of a man unknown, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES CANDLAN
. On the 1st of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Drury-lane—I saw the prisoner and another following a gentleman, and trying his pocket; and just as he got opposite a shop the prisoner went and got his handkerchief half out—the gentleman then went into the road, as there was a crowd; and when he had got about five yards further, he came on the pavement—the prisoner then went and got the handkerchief out—he turned down a street, and the other one who was with him whistled—I told an officer—we followed and took the prisoner—there were six or seven hundred people there looking at the sweeps—I do not know who the gentleman was.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where was the prisoner stopped? A. In a street out of Drury-lane—the handkerchief was thrown down—the gentleman was walking on the pavement, in and out amongst the crowd—I was in the road, and could see between the people—the gentleman went into the road, till he passed the crowd, and then went on the pavement again—I am a saddler.





GEORGE WESTON
 (police-sergeant T 6.) I saw the prisoner running down Drury-lane, and just as he got to Brownlow-street he threw a handkerchief to another person—I followed, and took the prisoner—he said, "What do you take me for?"—I said, "For picking a gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief"—he said, "I have not got it, you are mistaken."

Cross-examined. Q. Who was the person the handkerchief was given to? A. I believe he was taken last night for picking pockets—I tried to take him at the time, but he got away—I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the man.

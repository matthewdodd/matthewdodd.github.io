ANN HARVEY
. I am the wife of James Harvey, chair-maker, of Edward-street, Bethnal-green-road—on the 7th of June I saw my son William safe at half-past two o'clock—he had on a plaid frock, and plaid socks—he went out to play a little while, and I did not see him again till the next morning at half-past six o'clock, when he was at Bow station-house.





ELIZABETH DYKES

I met the prisoner in Back-alley, at the back of Bow-road, between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 7th of June—she had this child with her, lugging him along—the child was bitterly crying—I passed her and then met two females, who asked me if I had seen a person with a child—I said, "Yes"—I went with them, and caught the prisoner by the arm—I asked what she was going to do with the child—she said, what was that to me—I kept hold of her, and gave her to the police—she said she was going to take the child to Bromley to her brother—I said I would insist on going with her to see if it was correct.

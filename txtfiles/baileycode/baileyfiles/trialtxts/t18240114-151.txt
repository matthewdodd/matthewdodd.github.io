            . On the 13th of January, I was in Whitechapel


, about three o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner met me, snatched my handkerchief out of my hand, and ran up a gateway. I pursued him, calling for assistance - several people were about, but none attempted to assist. He threw it down. I continued to follow, and overtook him, knocked him down, and collared him. A person came and rescued him from me - I collared himagain, and about half way down Whitechapel, the person rescued him again. I followed him a long way, knocked him down, and got him to the office, as I could not get an officer. I never lost sight of him. The handkerchief was picked up, and given to me.
Prisoner's Defence. I was intoxicated, and did not know what I was doing.

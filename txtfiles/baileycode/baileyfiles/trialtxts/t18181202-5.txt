. On the 24th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting at the back of my shop, a boy came in and said a man had run out with a coat; I ran out, saw the prisoner running, and called out Stop thief! he was stopped in Great Newport-street, by Morgan. The coat has never been found - it was worth 4 l.

            . I am a mariner
; on the 13th of August, between nine and ten at night, I saw these two prisoners standing at an alley; they asked me to give them a glass of wine, and said, they were very cold; I carried them to the Golden Lion in the Old-Bailey


, and gave them a pint of red port, we were together about half an hour; I missed two guineas, I did not feel their fingers in my fob; I charged 
               
                  Anne 
                  Saunders 
               



             with it before I left the room; they both denied it; I called the master, and sent for a constable; they were searched, and one guinea was found upon Saunders, and one upon Williams; Saunders was near my pocket, the other was not; I had been drinking, but was not fuddled; I cannot swear to the money; when I paid my reckoning I had the two guineas and a half in my pocket.

            . On the 13th of August I was sent for to the Golden Lion to take charge of 
               
                  Anne 
                  Saunders 
               



            , for robbing the gentleman of two guineas; 
               
                  Anne 
                  Saunders 
               



             said she had no money, only a few halfpence in her pocket; I searched her, and found six-pence halfpenny; then I searched farther, and in the shoe of her right foot I found a guinea; the other prisoner declared she had no money, taking off her cap a guinea fell out of her hair.
The prisoners in their defence said, the prosecutor picked them up, and made each a present of a guinea, and after he had his will of Saunders he wanted his money again.

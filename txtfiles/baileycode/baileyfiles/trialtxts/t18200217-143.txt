            . I am watchman of St. Marylebone. On the 28th of January, about twenty minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go along my beat, from the prosecutor's premises, with the timber on his shoulder. I stopped him, and asked him where he came from, and where he was going to? he would not answer, but walked on as fast as he could. I laid hold of him, and said,
"Throw it down, I will see what it is!" It was laid in a sack, entirely covered over. He said,
"Let me go," and resisted very violently. He escaped after I had torn his jacket; he was secured about half a mile off. I sent him to the watch-house, and took the timber to Hall. I saw him getting over the wall of the premises.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

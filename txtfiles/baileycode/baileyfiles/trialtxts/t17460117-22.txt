            (to Loat.) That Grate you came to demand of Mrs. Athill, was it your Grate?
Loat. Yes.
Q. Tell us how you came to find out the Woman.
Loat. Mrs. Athill's Daughter refused giving me the Grate, not thinking it proper till she had advised with her Mother, who in about an Hour's Time came to my Shop, for I desir'd she would send her to me. When she came, I asked her whether she knew the Person she bought them of. She said she was a little Woman, remarkable for fore Eyes.
The Prisoner said, she was sent by another Woman to sell her Grate. But Loat and Mrs. Athill said, she confess'd before the Justice that she took it, and if they would make it up with her, she would pay the Shilling when she could. 


               Guilty 10 d.

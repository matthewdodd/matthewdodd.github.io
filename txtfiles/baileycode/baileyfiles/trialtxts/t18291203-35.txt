. The prisoner had been twice in my service; the first time for about sixteen months, and the last time about a month - she absconded on the morning of the 27th of November, and my watch was missed; I took an officer, and found her the next day - the watch was in her pocket, and the other articles in a bundle on the table - it is all mine.

            . I went with the prosecutor to a house in Baldwin's-court; I found this property in a bundle on the table - I then found this watch in a pocket of hers, at a house in Trinity-lane; which I had been at before.

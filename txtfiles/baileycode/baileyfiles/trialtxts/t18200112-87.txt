            . On Sunday, the 19th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, as I was going down Mount-pleasant


 three boy
s met me, turned back, and followed me. I ran, and they ran after me; one of them gave me a slight blow on the head, and took my shawl away; I called out Stop thief! but did not see any one stop him. I ran after him, but lost sight of him. I was telling some people, and saw the prisoner coming towards me. I laid hold of him, and said,
"This is the boy" - I am sure he is the boy who took my shawl, and struck me.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. It was done in an instant - A. No, they followed me, and I turned back and looked at them - my shawl was produced. I am servant to Mrs. Finikin, Gray's Inn-lane.

            . I live in Dane's-court, Oxford-road


; the prisoner did work for me by the direction of her daughter; I found the sheets pawned in her name; I got a warrant for her, and took her before Justice Welch; there she owned she had pawned them; she said she intended to take them out again without my knowledge. I found the blanket in her lodging. (The goods produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the blanket home to mend; I was necessitated for money.

            . I live in St. Gyles's


. The prisoner took a lodging in my house, the latter end of January last. She continued with me about eight days. About the 6th of Feb. we miss'd a sheet, one was new the other old, she took the new one. We miss'd a candlestick from off the stairs. When I talk'd with her about my things, she told me, she would give me a good beating, like an old rogue as I was; but at last she owned taking the sheet.
Prisoner's Defence.
It was a common lodging-house. I happened to stay late out one night, he let my bed, and put me down into a cellar.

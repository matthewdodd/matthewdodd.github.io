WILLIAM REYNOLDS
. I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the 19th of September I went to New-street, New-cut, LambethDuke, Hall, and Ashton were with me—I arrived a little before four o'clock in the afternoon, and observed a female knocking at the door of No. 1—the door was opened by Carman—I rushed into the passage and was collared by Carman, who screamed out violently—Duke followed me in immediately—I released myself from Carman and went up staris, and in going up I had occasion to pass by the back parlour door—I observed the prisoner Jenkins called Thomas Field in the back parlour in his shirt sleeves, and at the top of the staris was Sophia Jenkins, who had nothing on but her shift—she said, "My God, what is the matter?"—she went into the bacje room first floor, on to a bed which was lying on the floor, and wrapped a blanket round her—I went into the front room, first floor, and seeing no one there, I ran down stairs, hearing a noise in the back yard—I met Ashton as I was coming down the stairs, and we both ran into the yard together—I found Carman in the yard then, and nobody else—I saw two crown pieces lying on the stones in the yard, and two in the water-tub—I requested Ashton to pick them up, which he did, and in a small drain, near the water-butt, having a little clear water in it, I observed through the water a crown-pieco—I put my arm down the drain and took it up—this is it—I then went into the back parlour, and found Hall and Duke and the two male prisoners, (Field and the boy Jenkins)—on a chair in the room, I found a small file containing white metal in the teeth, also a paper band with a small portion of plaster of Paris on it—Duke in my presence proceeded to search the room, and while he was doing so, the boy F.T. Jenkins was very violent, screaming out "Murder!" dreadfully—Field was standing in one corner of the room with his hancuffs on him—while Duke was searching the female prisoner, Sophia Jenkins put her hand in through the window, which was open, and seized hold of something which Duke had laid down on the chair—Duke laid hold of her hand and endeavoured to get it from her, but did not succeed—at that moment Field sprang from the corner at which he was standing, and seized at Duke with the handcuffs on—that prevented Duke from getting hold of what Sophia Jenkins had—I laid hold of Field by his hand and pulled him back, and afterwards took away Field and the boy Jenkins in a coach which I had waiting.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. When Carman opened the door, did you say any thing to her? A. I did not—I did not inquire for any body—I rushed in immediately, and was followed by a brother officer, and by more than one—I did not hear either of them say a word before they rushed in—the water-tub stood about half-a-foot from the ground—there were five or six pails of water in it—the officers were rushing into the room when the boy screamed "Murder"—Sophia Jenkins was not in a situation to have any thing to do with what was going on in the room—one of the officers was struggling with Sophia Jenkins when Field sprand from the corner of the room with his handcuffs on—he was not using violence towards her—he had got hold of her hand—I do not call it violence—she put her hand through the window to take what she did, and he laid hold of her hand—he

used no more violence that was necessary—I know of no connexion between Field and Sophia Jenkins—I saw Field in the passage in his shirt sleeves—I did not see him do any act of coining—he had not the opportunity while the officers were there—his standing in his shirt sleeves, and interfering in defence of the woman, were the on ly things I saw him do.

MR. CHAMBERS. Q. It was after Carman had screamed out at the door that you saw him? A. Yes; there were no other persons in the house but the four prisoners.





WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON
. I am a police-segeant. I went on the 19th of September, in company with Duke, Hall, and Reynolds, to No.1, New Cut, Lambeth—I arrived there about a quarter to four o'clock—I saw the door of the house opened—Reynolds went in first—Duke and I pushed in together and Reynolds was in the passage with Carman—I pushed by him, and saw a man, with his coat off, endevouring to get over the wall in the yard—that was Field—I heard something like money falling—there was nobody else in the yard—Duke and I prevented his getting over the wall I—afterwards looked about the yard, and found two crown-pieces lying on the pavement in the yard, and these two crown-pieces were in the water-butt, close to where Field was endeavouring to get over the wall—I saw Reynolds take a crown-piece out of the drain—I afterwards looked over the wall, being certain there was more money, I got over the wall, and found this bag with coin it it, and some coins spread about the yard—I collected them all into the bag—there were 49 shillings, 10 hals-crowns and 2 crown-pieces, one of them unfinished—as I was taking the money up, I heard a great noise next door, and was desired to come and I ran round the adjoining house into No. 1, to assist the officers—I went into the back parlour, and Field was given into my custody—Hall and I took him in a coach—Hall brought the boy Jenkins to the coach, and we took them both to Clerkenwell station-house—a man named Cooper went into the passage of No.1 with us—he staid there for a short time—when we were in the coach with Field the boy was crying and Field said, "Be a good boy and be quiet"—I said, "Is he your boy?"—he said "I shall answer no questions"—I said he need not without h e liked—about a minute afterwards, without saying amy more, he said, "No, it is not my boy' I dare say you know that, from where you got your information"—I observed Field's left hand was very black in the coach as if he had been working at the fire, and he kept rubbing it on his trowsers—I said "You are taking a great deal of pains to get that stuff off your hands"—he said "What stuff? I don't know what you mean."

Field. It was the juice of an apple which the officer had given me. Witness. It was a quantity of black stuff of the back of his hand, as if he had been holding it over the smoke.

Cross-examined. Q. What time of the day was this? A. I can't say to a few minutes—I should say about a quarter to four—the yard is about ten feet by five or six—I heard the sound of coin falling, but did not see it fall—if a bag of coins had been thrown from up stairs, and burat, some of it might have fallen on each side the wall—the black markds were on the back of his fingers—Reynolds gave him an apple as he complained of being thirsty, and wanted porter—I know nothing of two persons named Smith occupying an apartment in the house—the boy cried very much—I saw Carman in the yard afterwards—I rushed into the house very suddenly—it might have frightened her.





ROBERT DUKE
. I am a police-officer, of Hatton-garden. I went with

the officers to the house in the New Cut—I went into the back parlour—I observed the boy Jenkins stamping violently on some white substance, and I afterwards discovered it to be a piece of plaster of Paris mould—when I had got him in my arms, he cried out "Murder" very violently—I afterwards found on the table in the room, this wooden frame, as it now is—it is used for the purpose of holding a mould—I also found a pair of scissors, and a pair of plyers, a file which appears to have been used for white metal; and on the chair I found part of a spoon with the end melted and three new spoons in a paper, as they now are—also a knife with a quantity of white plaster on it—and on the floor I picked up some pieces of plaster of Paris mould, which I now produce—this metal get I picked up, but it was so hot I was obliged to let it fall again—it is that part of the metal which fills the aperture or neck of the mould—on the shelf, by the side of the fire-place, I found a paper containing a quantity of counterfeit coin, which I handed over to Hall—I also found a box on the same shelf, containing eleven pieces of white metal, and a good half-crown—I found on the mantel-piece a small spoon, with some white substance about it; and on another shelf, two bags of plaster of Paris, nearly full, and two small files—I observed the fire, it was very birght, and this ladle was on it, with this white metal in it, in a fluid state—after taking up the pieces of mould from the floor, I placed them on a chair near the window—the prisoner Sophia Jenkins was at that timein the yard, and the window was open—she reached her arm in, and took some of the pieces of mould off the chair, and succeeded in destroying them, which prevents my producing all the pieces I found on the floor—I took Sophia Jenkins to the station-house, and on the road I said to her, that her husband was engaged in a very dangerous business—she told me he could not help it, that he was a smith by trade, and he had been out of work a long time.

Cross-examined. Q. Where did that conversation take place? A. Going to the station-house, in Rosoman-street—I believe she began the conversation herself—I found the get on the floor—I cannot tell how long the metal had been on the fire—I should think the fire would smoke his hand—I know of nobody else occupying part of the house—there was nobody else in the house at the time.

MR. CHAMBERS. Q. Was the use of this ladle likely to make a hand black? A. Yes; it is black enough now.





WILLIAM HALL
. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I went to this house with the other officers—I produce twenty-nine shillings, two crown-pieces, and one half-crown, which were given me by Duke, who took them out of a cupboard, by the side of the fire-place.





JOHN FIELD
. I am Inspector of coin to the Mint. This is a frame which might be used to bold moulds together—it is generally used for that purpose, to hold the two parts firmly together—this is part of a plaster-ofParis mould for casting a crown-piece—there is a portion of the impression of the obverse side of a crown-piece on it now, and three are some of the letters of the word Britannia—the channel of the mould, through which metal is poured, is still remaining, and this get corresponds in size with the channel—this is the obverse side of a half-crown mould, dated 1826, and it has some of the letters—here is a mould for a shilling, with the obverse and reverse impressions nearly complete, of the date of 1819—I have examined the other things; they are all implements of coining and casting, and such as are generally used—the crown-pieces are apparently intended to resemble the current coin—all the coin produced is counterfeit,

and is cast with white metal, and this good half-crown appears to have been used to make the mould.

Cross-examined. Q. By what test do you ascertain them to be bad? A. The coin of the realm is struck with a die—these are cast in a mould, and this is white metal.





WILLIAM REYNOLDS

re-examined. I first saw Field in the back parlour—it was before Ashton saw him.

JURY. Q. What was the nature of Carman's exclamation when you entered the house? A. She screamed out, that is all—she resisted and struggled with me—she had no reason to know me, that I am aware of.

Field's Defence. In the first place—at Hatton-garden, nothing was sworn about my being seen in the room below stairs till I was brought there by the officers—I was taken handcuffed from the yard to the room—I had called at the house twenty minutes before to visit Sophia Jenkins, and stopped there, as she was ill—I formerly lived with her—I slept there once or twice a week then—I had left her, and came down stairs to go to the business of my master, who is unable to attend here—I was taken; and othere witnesses I might have had here, may not come, understanding the Mint cases would not be tried till Friday morning—my landlord would have been here, had he due notice of the case—I will next observe, that, while in the water-closet, the prisoner Jenkins (who will acknowledge I was there, and merely came to visit her)—She heard there was something amiss, and called to me to let me escape—I have surfered from something of this sort before—I declare I was never in eighter of the lower rooms—the landlord of the house was summoned to give evidence at the office; and when called on, he said he was the rent-gatherer, and that only Smith and his wife had taken the house—they said, "Look round, and see if you can see Smith"—he looked round, and said, "I do not see him"—the Magistrate asked him to look at the prisoner, if that was him—he said, "No, I decidedly not; it was a bigger man than him"—he said, "Don't you think it possible that might be him?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I beg your pardon, your Worship, I hope you don't want the man to swear to me"—the Magistrate said, "Silence, Sir; pur your hat on; don't interrupt the witness;" and I put my hat on, but he could not identify me—I declare my innocence of having been in eighter of the lower rooms, or having possession of the coin.





JOHN MARMOY
. I live at No. 43, New York-street, Bethnal-green. The prisoner field lived in my house for 12 or 15 months, as near as I can recollect—I do not know who he worked for—I remember this Saturday, the 19th of September—he did not come home to dinner that day—I have known him longer than the time he lodged with me—he bore an honest character.

MR. CHAMBERS. Q. When did the prisoner first come to lodge at your house? A. About 12 or 15 months since, but I am not certain to a day, as he always paid me every Saturday—I do not know how he got his livelihood, only as a mechanic—he came in a mechanic's dress—I had heard he worked somewhere near whitechapel, but where, I never knew—I don't know any of his friends.

Prisoner Field. Q. Was not I at home to dinner on the Saturday in question? Try and recollect yourself. Witness. Oh! Yes, he was at dinner on the Saturday, but he did not come home that night—he dined at home about one o'clock, and left about ten minutes after two.

Field. I went from the house of my landlord to my work at

Whitechapel; but I don't wish to bring the young man's name in the way who employed me, as it might injure him—he is an upholsterer—I had gone over to Webber-row on business for him, and visited Jenkins, she being ill at the time—I laid down there, which may account for my being in my shirt sleeves—I staid about a quarter of an hour with her, and went down to the privy—a messenger had arrived from a house where Mr. Powell knows an apprehension had taken place, about an hour before, and the policemen had to go to Rosoman-street with the prisoners they took, and then came over the water to the New Cut, during which time there were popportunities for parties to convey intelligence to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who could have made their escape, and left the articles as they were found.

Jenkins's Defence. These two young men are quite innocent—the landlord was not at home—I had two rooms on the first floor.

Field. The officer struck the woman with his staff, which made me go to her assistance.





ROBERT DUKE

re-examined. There was no staff used, not one was taken out of any officer's pocket.

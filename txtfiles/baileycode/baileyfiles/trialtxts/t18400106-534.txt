ANDREW JONES
was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of December, 80lbs. weight of lead, value 14s., the goods of 



Chariot Covell, and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.






JOSEPH MATTHEWS.
I am a watchman of Stratford. On the 20th of December, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner run across the road with this lead—I ran and said to him "What have you got here"—I saw it was lead, and I went on and called the next watchman—I then said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this lead"—he said, "I brought it from Mr. Green's, at Laytonstone; I and a plumber, and I am going to exchange this for new"—I locked him up, and then found the prosecutor—the prisoner was about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw him—he was a stranger to me.





JOHN BARTLETT.
I am a constable. Matthews came to me that morning at a quarter-past three o'clock—I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner there with this lead—he said he was going to exchange it for new—he said he was a plumber, and would I take care of the lead till he got a note from the lady at Laytonstone.





CHARLES COVELL.
I rent a house at Stratford. I saw this lead secure on the house when I went home, a little before twelve o'clock at night, on the 19th of December—it was fixed over the bow-window—I know this to be the lead, by a cut in it, which was made when it was tried once before—there is about eighty pounds weight of it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Woodford, and saw the sack containing this lead in the road; I picked it up, and thought It must have dropped from a cart; I carried it some distance; I had no tools of any description.

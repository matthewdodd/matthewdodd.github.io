. I saw the prisoner on the 4th of March, take the spoon out of the kitchen passage; he got about three or four yards with it; he- I went out of the pantry, and stopped him with it; he asked if a person named Williams lived there - there was no such person; I called the butler, who sent me for an officer - the prisoner was quite a stranger.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and received this spoon from the butler.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written Defence; stating, that he had called at the house to inquire for a situation, and denied having had the spoon in his possession.

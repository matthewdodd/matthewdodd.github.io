            , deposed,
"that the prisoner
"was a servant
 to them, and was employed
"to serve in a shop belonging to them
"in Chandois-street , where he was to sell
"goods for ready money only, and was to give
"credit to none but their known customers;
"that when they took an account of their stock
"at that shop on the 1st of August, 1773,
"they discovered a great quantity of goods to
"be missing; and that the silk mentioned in
"the indictment was entered by the prisoner
"in their books, as sold upon credit to Mrs.
"Hunt in Charles-street, Berkley square , on
"the 16th of July, 1772; that the prisoner
"was taken before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , when he
"acknowledged that the silk was not sold to
"a Mrs. Hunt, and confessed that he did not
"know any such person, but that he delivered
"the silk, in discharge of a debt, to two daughters
"of a Dr. Ryan.

                   Russell
               



            , who has the conduct of the shop in Chandois-street , confirmed Mr. Paul's evidence, and added,
"that the prisoner acknowledged
"to him that the sale of the
"silk to Dr. Ryan was on the 12th of February,
"1772, and that they did not discover
"that the entry of the silk in their books to
"Mrs. Hunt was fictitious till last January ."
The prisoner in his defence called six witnesses who gave him a very good character.

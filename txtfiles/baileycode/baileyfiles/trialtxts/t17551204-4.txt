            . Last Tuesday was seven night, as I was coming along the Strand


, I felt somebody at my pocket. Mr. Wilmot took the prisoner, with the handkerchief upon him, my property.
Mr. Wilmot. On the 25th of November I was attack'd by a companion of the prisoner; he made an attempt at a lottery ticket I had in my hand. Seeing him join the prisoner and another man, I made it my business to observe them. I saw the man in their company (named Curd), point over the way to the prosecutor, as a man may do to a dog, crying hi ver. Immediately the prisoner went over to him, and put his left hand into his pocket, and took out his handkerchief. I went and took hold of, and closed the prisoner's hand with the handkerchiefs in it. I said to the prosecutor, Is this your handkerchief? He look'd at it, and said he would sware it was his property. Then we took the boy before Justice Welch. and the boy confessed that Curd and Williams; were the names of two who were with him, and said that was the fourth handkerchief he had taken that day.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.




               Guilty 10 d.
            

See him tried before, No 302, in the last Mayoralty.

            . I am a milkman
, and live in Cromer-street. The prisoner is my son, and has been to sea - he was at home with me for about a fortnight; I missed a sovereign and nine shillings out of the till in my parlour, about eight o'clock on Sunday evening - he had been in the parlour, and immediately he went out I went to the till, suspecting him, and missed the money; he did not return - I found him at a public-house by the London-docks, at twelve o'clock at night, and found 3s. 9d. on him; he said he had robbed me; nobody else could have taken it - I had seen it in the till that afternoon.
Prisoner. My father drove me out of doors.
JOHN AXTILL. It is not true - he is constantly leaving home; I have five children at home.

            . Aged 21. - 


               Transported for Seven Years

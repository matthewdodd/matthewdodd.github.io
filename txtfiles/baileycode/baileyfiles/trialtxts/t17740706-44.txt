             I am servant to Mr. Zeidler; I was alone in the house at the time it was broke open; I went up into the garret where my box was. I saw a hole in the cieling, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them).
Q. Was it light or dark at the time you discovered it?
Jeffs. It was quite dark; I had been up in that room about half an hour before; it was so dark then I was obliged to have a candle; the cieling was not broke at that time. I went to the public house for assistance and the prisoner was taken.

                   Jeffs
               



             came to me and told me her master's house had been broke open; I went there; I saw a hole in the cieling of the garret; they had got up an empty house, and so got to the top of Mr. Zeidler's house; they got into the cock lost, and then broke a hole through the cieling of the garret to put a hand through and unbolt the trap door; we found no one in the house, but in searching about we found the prisoner concealed in a necessary house. We found the things mentioned in the indictment in the empty house. The prisoner made a voluntary confession that he hid himself in the empty house till it was dark, and then got up to the top of that house and so broke into the prosecutor's house.
Prisoner's Defence.
They gave me liquor at the watch-house to say so, which I did.
Q. to Evans. How far did you find the prisoner from Mr. Zeidler's house?
Evans. I found him over one yard; the trunk with the things in it was found under the stairs of the adjoining house. The prisoner called his sister, who said that the prisoner had been to sea; that she kept him till he got into another ship, but that he had run away from her for a fortnight; in which time he had got himself into Clerkenwell Bridewell.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house, but guilty of stealing the goods to the value of 39 s

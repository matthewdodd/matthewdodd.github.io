THOMAS SMITH
. I am shopman to Andrew Ross and another, who live in Regent-street. The prisoner came in and asked to look at a gold eye-glass for Mr. Jones, of Jermyn-street—I took a tray of gold and silver articles from the counter, and showed him some—he said he wanted one with two glasses, a double one of the best chased solid gold—I showed him two, and said the price was 3l. 10s.—he said the one that Mr. Jones bad he had paid 3l. 15s. for—I was obliged to leave that part to ring a bell for a person to attend to another customer—I then came back, and missed an article from the tray that I had shown the prisoner—he went out, and said ten minutes would do to send them round—I followed him and saw him go into a public-house—he was examining something—I got a policeman and took him, found one frame that I had not missed, and on searching him further we found this other, which I had missed—I went home and missed them both.

Prisoner. Q. Have you any mark on them? A. no, I know the articles.





ADOLPHUS TEAL
 (police-constable C 107.) I took the prisoner, and found one of these frames in his handkerchief, and the other in the lining of his hat.

Prisoner's Defence. Both of them belonged to me; I did not know the exact value of them; I bought them of a Jew; he told me I should gain money by them, and I went to the prosecutor's shop to ascertain the value of one similar to them.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

There were two other indictments against the prisoner for stealing letters which had come from a General Post receiving-house, upon which indictments no evidence was offered.
The prisoner was convicted last Session on an indictment for stealing a 10l. note, which came into his possession in the employ of the Post-office, (see page 578.) but the Learned Judges, to whom his case was referred, have decided that the conviction was not good.

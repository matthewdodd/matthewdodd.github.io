MARY ROUTLIDGE
. My husband's name is Joseph, we live in Brewer street, Pimlico, and I take in washing. On the 26th of October I sent the prisoner with a bundle of clothes to No. 4, Tenderden-street, Hanover-square—this is the bundle I gave her—it contains the articles stated.





CAROLINE DITCHFIELD
. I received the bundle from Mary Routlidge—I was going up the Haymarket—I did not observe the prisoner behind me till he he came right by the side of me and snatched the bundle from me—I followed him in the best manner I could, and there were two young men who held him till the policeman came—when he snatched it he put it under his right arm, then he put it round behind him and dropped it—I never lost sight of him—I am sure he is the person.

Prisoner. I did not take it out of her hand—I found it in going up the Haymarket—she came to me and asked me to give it her—I dropped it down, and hearing a cry of "Stop thief," I ran, and was stopped and given to the policeman.




GUILTY

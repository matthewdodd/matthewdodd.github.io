JOHN BREALY
. I live at No. 15, Stevenson-street, Maiden-lane. On the evening of the 22nd of January, I was called out of the Albion public-house—I went round to the back of the houses and got over the wall—I found the door of No. 1 open—I went up stairs, and found the roof broken in—I got out, with several more, and found lot of lead on the roof near the hole—there were several houses stripped of lead—we put the lead down the hole, and went over the roofs, and found the prisoners between No. 4 and No. 5—I caught hold of John, lying behind the chimney, with his feet towards the gutter—I asked him if there were any more—he said, "Yes, one more "—another man went end caught the other prisoner.





JOHN STRECHY
 (police-constable N 133.) I went up the house and found a hole broken through—I assisted these men on the roof—I took the prisoners down the hole—I took this lead and fitted it on the roofs—it fitted exactly—I observed to the Sergeant that they must have been there several times, and the prisoners said, "No, we have only been there twice, and the last time was last Thursday."





JOSEPH STANBRIDGE ROGERS CLARKE
. I am agent to Mr. Gerald Walsh. He is landlord of the house—I have seen the lead, and have no doubt it belongs to him.

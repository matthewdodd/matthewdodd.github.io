            . I live at Edmonton. On the 6th of October, my cart stood at Mr. Child's door, in Thames-street


. I was in the house about three minutes, and on turning round, missed the coat out of it; I ran to Pudding-lane, and saw the prisoner with it under his arm. I followed him, a person behind me whistled, and he immediately dropped it; I called Stop thief! he was collared without my losing sight of him.

            . I am a confectioner. I was coming down Pudding-lane, and heard the cry of stop him; when the prisoner came to the top of the hill, he returned, I collared him, and said if he lifted his hand up at me, I would knock his head off. Burton came up with the coat.

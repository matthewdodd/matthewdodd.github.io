               's-head; a public house
; I was informed on Wednesday the 13th of December, that some people had been found with a number of pots; and I went to the public office in Poland-street, and there I found two pints and one quart pot, which are mine; there were no more of mine.

             sworn.
On Wednesday the 13th of December, about nine in the morning, a person came in, and gave information of a pot stealer; and I went and found the prisoner Hicks with some pots, at the top of Ogle-court, Mary-le-bone-street; and I can swear to this quart pot, which the prisoner Hicks dropped out of his apron; the woman was with him; I pursued and took them in Titchfield-street; he dropped the quart pot just as we laid hold of him; my master got a constable, and took them to the office in Poland-street; the woman had three pint pots and a quart in her apron; I brought this pot and pint from the office; the constable had them an hour in his custody; I knew them again; I am sure of the quart; I marked it.

             sworn.
I was gathering in my pots; my master lives at the Wheatsheaf, in Mary-le-bone-street; and I saw the two prisoners coming down Ogle-court; I did not know them before; and the last witness was coming after them, and I followed, and one M'Donald, a servant to the ship; we went up Ogle street, and met the prisoners in Titchfield-street and stopped them; and I saw a pot and a pint in her hand that I can swear to; they are the property of Mr. Hallam.

             sworn.
I am waiter at the Ship; I pursued with the rest, and took the prisoners; when I laid hold of the man's collar he let a pot and a pint out of his apron; that was all he had in his apron; I should not know the pots again; the woman had some pots with her; I do not know what quantity.
PRISONER HICKS'S DEFENCE.
I saw the pots stand, and I took them up, this woman passed me two or three times, and I took them up for fear she should steal them.
PRISONER ADAMS'S DEFENCE.
I took some of the pots out of his hand.

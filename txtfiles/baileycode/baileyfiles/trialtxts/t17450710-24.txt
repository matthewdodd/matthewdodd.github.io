            . On the 16th of June my wife and I went out for a day's pleasure; I was informed my house was broke open, and my drawers stripped: when I heard of it, I said the prisoner was the person that did it, for she was standing at the door when I went out at five o'clock in the morning. I got a warrant, and had her taken up at her lodgings in Newtoner's Lane: there were several of the things found upon her. She owned she broke open the house, and in what manner she did it: she said she attempted to take down a shutter, but she could not, so she took out the pannel of the door with a casement hook.

            . Confirmed her husband's evidence, and said the Prisoner had been a lodger in the house, but the person she lay with had quarrelled with her, and turned her out, and she lay all night upon the stairs.
The Prosecutor being only an inmate, it could not be his dwelling house; so the Prisoner was 


               acquitted of stealing in the dwelling house, and found guilty of the felony
            .

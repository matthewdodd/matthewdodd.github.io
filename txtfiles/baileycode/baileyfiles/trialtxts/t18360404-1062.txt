BRIDGET M'DONALD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of March, 2 pairs of stays, value 9s., the goods of 



George Muir; and that she been before convicted of felony.






MARTHA HUBBARD
. I was shop-woman to Mr. George Muir—he has a shop in Middle-row, Holborn. I was there on the 16th of March between one two o'clock, and the prisoner came in with another woman, who had a child—the other woman asked for a pair of stays to fit the child and five minutes after they were gone I missed a pair of stays, and these are them—they are my master's.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Does any person assist in his business? A. There was no one but myself in that shop.





JOHN M'GRAW
. I am a police-inspector. On the 27th of March I went to a house in Christopher-square, Long-alley—I found these stays in a box in the front parlour—i know the prisoner lived there.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know her husband is a hawker? A. I have heard him represent himself as such—I found them eleven days after they were missed—the prisoner had an opportunity to get rid of them.





MARTHA HUBBARD
. These are my master's stays.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you shop-woman there now? No—I let because I was not sufficiently experienced to stand an opposition—my master was not satisfied with my conduct—here is a mark on the led shoulder strap of these stays, No. 143—my master numbers all the pairs of stays regularly—no other pair had that number—I saw this pair safe the moment before the prisoner and the other woman came in the shop—they were on the counter.





JAMES PAINTER
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at the Sessions-house, Westminster (read)—the prisoner is the woman who was tried.

Prisoner I am innocent—I have worn these stays several time—I cannot account for what my husband buys and sells.




GUILTY
. Aged 20—


Transported for Seven Years.

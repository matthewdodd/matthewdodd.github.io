WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of February, 1 pair of gaiters, value 6s., the goods of 




Charles Frederick Crawley; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES FREDERICK CRAWLEY
. I live at No. 26, Bedford-street, Red Lion-square, Holborn, and am a tailor and breeches-maker. On the 27th of February the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me how I did—I have known him twelve or thirteen months—I kept on writing, and, while he stood talking to me, he took one of these gaiters out of the window, and asked what I charged for them—I said, "Six shillings"—I thought he had put it into the window again, but when I turned round to take the ink-bottle back, he opened the door, and I saw the edge of the gaiters as he went out—I went round, and saw him at the end of the street—I lost sight of him, but I gave information to the police, and he was soon after taken—these are my gaiters—(looking at them.)





THOMAS REEVE
. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner brought these gaiters to my shop on the 27th of February, and I stopped him will them—he said he made them himself—I gave information to the police.





JOHN DAVIES WHITE
 (police-constable G 40.) I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

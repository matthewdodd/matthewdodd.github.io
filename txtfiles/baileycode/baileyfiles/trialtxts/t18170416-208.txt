            . I keep the Horse and Groom, at Edmonton




. On the 25th of February, the prisoner took a bed at my house; the next day he said he had walked from Canterbury, was very tired, and should sleep there that night also. About half past nine o'clock, he said he should go to bed, and went up stairs. In about ten minutes, a man said he had seen some person go out with a bundle. I found three beds had been stripped of the sheets. I went out, and overtook the prisoner with them on his shoulder - He said he knew he had taken them. I secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

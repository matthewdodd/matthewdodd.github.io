            . I am a constable. On the 28th of August I was in St. James's-square


, and saw the prisoners with another, trying several gentlemens' pockets. I saw one of them draw a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket - I think it was Land, but am not certain. I could not get to the gentleman, the crowd was so great, but followed the prisoners, who ran round the square together. I took Land, and Gook took Eden, the third escaped. I found the handkerchief in Land's trowsers; I had seen him put it there.

            . I was with Ewer, and saw the prisoners and a larger boy, they were acting under his direction. I saw them try several gentlemens' pockets; they did it awkwardly, and the other seemed to reprimand them. I saw Land put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, then the big one interfered. I saw the handkerchief come from somewhere, and they ran into the crowd. I called to the gentleman, but lost him. I followed them round the square, and secured them. I found another handkerchief on Eden.

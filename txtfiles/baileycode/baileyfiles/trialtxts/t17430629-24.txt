             On the 13th of this Month. I was going from Ludgate-Hill up into Holbourn, I went thro' the New-Market, and a little before I came to the Corner of Holbourn-Bridge


. the Prisoner ran against me, I put my Hand into my Pocket, and perceived I had lost my Handkerchief, I knew I had it about half a Minute before; I laid hold of him, and said he had stole my Handkerchief; he had but little to say for himself, and threw the Handkerchief down upon the Ground.
Prisoner. Ask the Gentleman whether he is sure I took it out of his Pocket; I have never a Friend in the World - I am between 15 and 16 Years old. 


               Guilty 10 d.

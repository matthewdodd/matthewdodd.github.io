JOHN MARKS



, stealing 1 memorandum-hook, and 2 candlesticks, value 11s.; the goods of 



John Donken and others; having been before convicted.






CHRISTIAN RUSSELL
. I am single, and keep the British-school at Camberwell—Mr. John Donken is treasurer to the committee of the school, and a shareholder, and there are others—these candlesticks and books were on the mantelpiece in my school-room—I saw them safe on Friday night, 2d Feb., and missed them on Saturday afternoon; these are them.





MARIA WALKER
. At half-past three o'clock on Saturday afternoon, 3d Feb., I was looking out of window and saw three boys before the Britishschool—I told Miss Russell that I thought they were no good, and she went for a policeman—I watched and saw the prisoner, who was one of the boys, open the school-room window and get in—he and another handed these things to a bigger one outside—I went across the road—I saw two of them running—the prisoner threw this book down.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Coburg-road, and there was a policeman coming along; I passed three yards by him, and he hallooed out, "Stop thief!" I asked what he wanted me for; another policeman came up and gave me a punch on the head.





ALFRED BONNARD
 (policeman, V 301). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Newington—(read Convicted Oct., 1846, transported for seven years)—the prisoner is the boy—he has been convicted summarily since then. 


GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

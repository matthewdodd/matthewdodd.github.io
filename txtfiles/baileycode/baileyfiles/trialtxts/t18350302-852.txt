852. 




JOHN DARVILLE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of February, 1 saw, value 7s., the goods of 



William Toomer.






WILLIAM TOOMER
. I am a carpenter, and live in Crown-street, Soho. I was at work at a gentleman's house in Sutton-street—I had a saw there, and missed it on the 20th of February—this is it.





RICHARD BAYFIELD
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in St. Giles's. This saw was pawned with me by the prisoner, on the 20th of February, for two shillings—he has been in the habit of pawning other tools, which he said was for his father, who was a carpenter.





HENRY BAKER
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner—he said a man named George Phillips gave him the saw to pawn, and it was pawned in that name.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a carpenter, who told me he would give me two or three halfpence to pawn it, which I did—I should know the man again—I think his name is Williams—my father knows him, and I told him to go after him—I do not live with my father—I should like to learn a business.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a carpenter. On the 10th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I was awoke by some dirt falling down the chimney of my bed-room; I heard a noise in the yard, and got up; as I was lifting up the window I saw some lead thrown down. I called Williams and sent him and the watchman to the back of the premises, where the lead was thrown from. I went into my house, dressed myself, and saw the prisoner cross the roof of four houses; I secured him under a stack of chimnies; we took him back through my own house - he was very resolute, and threatened to throw us off the roof. When more assistance came, we took him down, and gave him in charge. I found 164 lbs. of lead thrown down at the back of the premises - it had been cut off the roof of an unfinished house, which belonged to 
               
                  Caroline 
                  Lewis
               



             - I compared it with the house.

            . I went on the roof, and secured the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

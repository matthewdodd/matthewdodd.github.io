            . I am an officer of Marylebone. On the 8th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I received information, and watched by a cellar in Carey-street, St. Giles' - I saw the prisoner go to the cellar, pull the flap open, and go down; I went down after him - I could hardly, see it was so dark - I said, "What is your name?" I believe he said Francis - I said, "Come to the light" - he threw his hat off, and I found two pewter pots in it; I found a string tied round his waist, with another pot suspended to it, concealed; I proceeded to search the cellar, and he tried to escape - I pulled him back, and in the cellar found this frying-pan, with metal sticking to it.

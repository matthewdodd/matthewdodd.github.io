THOMAS ANSELL

JAMES THOMAS MILLS

(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. Part of this is my property, and part he gave me to dispose of in the best way I could; I beg mercy for the sake of my children.





THOMAS ANSELL
. I never gave her any, or told her to pledge any thing.

 (police-constable P 236.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

ANN SMITH
. I am the wife of John Matthew Smith; I have not

beard of my husband for two years; he was alive then; I keep a tobacconist's-shop in Fetter-lane. On the 27th of July I was in my parlour adjoining my shop—the prisoner walked into the shop, opened the glass case of the window, and took out a bundle of cheroots—he went to the door, then returned, shut the glass door, and walked out—I walked after him, and spoke to a neighbour—I took him—he had thrown the cigars away—he was never out of my sight.





JAMES STREIGHT
. I live in Plough-court. I saw the cigars picked up—they were given to me—I gave them to the prosecutrix, who identified them.





HENRY WHITECHURCH
. I am a gentleman's servant. I saw the prisoner pass under my master's carriage, and throw down these cigars.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

Price's Defence. We went down to Uxbridge with some fish, and met with a man that we knew. We drank with him at the George, and got intoxicated in liquor. We lost our way in the dark; I was leading the horse, and being dark we put the cart and horse in this field and went and laid down to sleep, and when we returned to the field these men secured us, and told us we must go with them. I brought the bundle of hay from the house where we had been drinking, and where we laid down to sleep. They went out about seven o'clock and brought this copper into the public-house. I never saw the copper before in my life.
White's Defence. I have nothing further to say than we had been to Uxbridge; we missed our way and overset the cart, it being dark and foggy, we put the cart into the field.

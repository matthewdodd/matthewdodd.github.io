            . I am a butcher
 in Carnaby-market


; last Friday was three weeks a whole carcase of mutton, ready dressed, was taken out of my shop between nine and ten o'clock at night; we had observed the prisoner lurking about, and had a mistrust of him; when it was gone, some went one way, some another; the prisoner and carcase were brought back.

            . I dressed the sheep; when it was brought back, I knew it to be the property of my master, the prosecutor.
Mr. Scott. I was going home that night a little before ten o'clock, the prisoner came cross King-street; I said, where are you going with this sheep at this time of the night; presently I heard a noise of people coming from the market way; he laid the carcase down upon a bulk, and slipt in among the crowd.
Prisoner's defence.
I had been out paying some money; I was got in liquor very much, I do not know where I strolled, they say they took me in King-street.

- Walter depos'd, Thus he being in a Public House near Street-Lane, the Prosecutor came and told them he had been robbed, the this Deponent went with him to the House and demanded Entrance, but they refused it; after this they agreed to take the next Opportunity to detect them, and accordingly this Deponent and he met a Day or two after, and found the Prisoner walking down Fleet-Street, when the Prosecutor pick'd her up, and she carried him to the same House, and to the very Room where she had before pick'd his Pocket: This Deponent being the Manager of this Affair, no sooner saw them in the House, but he went and fetch'd a Watchman, and demanding Entrance they were let in; when asking for the Prosecutor, he came down, and charg'd the Watchman, saying, there was a Woman in the House who had robb'd him; accordingly they went up and found the Prisoner had quitted the Room, and ran up into the Garret, where they took her. She said in her Defence, That the Prosecutor and she innocently became acquainted in the Streets, and she having no Mind to go to a public House, she modestly took him home to her own Lodgings, that she had never seen him before, nor did she know any Thing of the Matter for which she stood indicted. But it appearing that her Modesty, her Honesty, and her Innocence, consisted only in Words, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

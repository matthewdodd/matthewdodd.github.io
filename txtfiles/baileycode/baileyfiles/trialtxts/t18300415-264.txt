CHARLES BAKER. I am a butcher
. On the 10th of April a person told my man a woman had taken this beef from the shop; I had seen it about ten minutes before - the man brought the prisoner back, and she had my beef; I said to my man, "This is the woman I told you to take care of."

            . I saw the prisoner take the beef from the shop, which she placed under her arm; she then took up another, took up her cloak at the corner, and laid that one down - I told the man, and he took her.

            . I am a hosier
. On the 24th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Smithfield


, and felt something at my right-hand coat pocket. I turned round and saw my handkerchief drop from the prisoner's hand. I picked it up and immediately collared him; he said
"I have not got your handkerchief."
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I could have got away, but knew myself innocent.

            . I am a tailor
, and live in Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane


. On the Tuesday before Easter, I hired the prisoner as a servant
. These sovereigns were in a drawer, which was divided into two parts, on the ground floor room; she was in the room every day - on Friday I unlocked the drawer, and gave her money to buy soap, and saw the three sovereigns there then; I left the key in the drawer - she returned with the soap, and went into the room, put on her bonnet, and said the draft came in at the door; she went on washing, and a little before ten o'clock asked for a halfpenny to by some potatoes, which I gave her; she went out, and never returned. I went into the room, found the drawer open, and the sovereigns gone - I did not see her again till the 25th, when I charged her with it - she said nothing.

            . I am a watchman. I apprehended her at a lodging house in Wentworth-street. The prosecutor charged her with this; I asked how she came to do it - she made no answer.

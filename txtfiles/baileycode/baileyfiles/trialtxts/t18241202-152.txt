JOHN WESTON. I live at Belfont


. On the 3d of November, at six o'clock in the morning, I went to work. I left my trunk in my bed-room, at Mr. Sherborne's house, about eleven o'clock on the same day. I heard something about my trunk - I went home, and all the things were gone out of it. I missed a smock-frock, two shirts, two pair of stockings, one waistcoat, a pair of breeches, two handkerchiefs, a half crown, and two farthings, which were in a canvass bag; they were all safe on the night before, when I went to bed. I saw them again the same day before the Magistrates.

            . I am a carpenter, and live near Belfont; a man named 
               
                  John 
                  Latan
               



             brought the prisoner to a public-house with a bundle, and told me he thought he had got a thief. I asked the prisoner where he got the bundle; he said, out of a bed-room at Belfont, and if I would go with him he would shew me the box in a plantation - that he had broken it open, and that was the contents - it proved to be Weston's box; the prisoner is a farmer's man
, and used to live there.

The prosecutor is a Dutchman
; he was going thro' Bishopsgate


 October 31, about seven at night, the prisoner took off his hat, and ran down St. Helen's gateway. Benjamin Polock saw it done; 
               
                  John 
                  Howard 
               



             was sweeping the church door there, who saw him run by with a hat in his hand, and another on his head, and said there were none but the prisoner gone down, and it was no thoroughfare. Mr. Polock bid him to abide at the gate while he went to see for the prisoner, who met him walking towards the gate; he asked him after the prosecutor's hat; he denied it at first; but at last fell down on his knees, and said, pray sir, if you'll forgive me, I'll tell you where it is (confessing that he had taken it) and it was found thrown over into Mr. Lodge's court.

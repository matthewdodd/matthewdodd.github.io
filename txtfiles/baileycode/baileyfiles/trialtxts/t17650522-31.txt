            . I am a midwife
, and lodge in Prince's-court, Hedge-lane


: on the 9th of January I found my chest, in which I put my cloaths and money, broke open: the prisoner lodged that night in the room where it was; she absconded at the same time. I searched for her, but could hear nothing of her till last Tuesday night: she was apprehended in Covent-Garden. On being examined she at first denied it, but at last she owned she did the fact: I asked her whether she did it with a chissel or a hammer; she said, neither, it was with a gimblet: I had not mentioned my having found the gimblet, at that time; she said she bored round the lock, and after that separated the wood from the lock, and opened the chest; and that she was advised to this by a young man named 
               
                  John 
                  Bedford 
               



            : she would not tell where the things were for a good while; all the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out: at first she said she lost part of the things, by running about to different lodgings; then she said she left some of them in Darkhouse-lane, and had pawned some of them on Ludgate-hill; and at last she said she had carried all the things to Canterbury, and left them there. I took her before Justice Kynaston; there she confessed she broke the chest, but would not own what she had done with the things, but that she said she had left them all at Canterbury: I have not found any of them again: she begged to go in at the Blakeney's-Head; there she confessed she let in that young man, at three in the m orning; that she lighted up a rush-light; that she took the bed-quilt from the bed, and shaded the window; that he persuaded her to break the chest with the gimblet, and she trembled and said she could not; but he bid her not be afraid, for nobody should hurt her: then he came and took the cloaths, and she never touched them: he bid her go down with one bundle, and convey them into the Bagnio-yard, and after that he would meet her at the upper end of St. Martin's-street; but when she came to the yard he was gone, with the money and things, and she never saw him since: we took her back to the justice; she confessed the same there: she said 
               
                  John 
                  Bedford 
               



             was Lady Gore's footman: we enquired for him, and found he was gone to Hinnington in Warwickshire.

            , who was with the prosecutrix and the prisoner, confirmed the account she had given.
The prisoner, in her defence, said she did not confess any thing.

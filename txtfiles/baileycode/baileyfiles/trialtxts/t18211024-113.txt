            . I am a Thames Police constable.On the 3d of October, about seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill with some rope on his shoulder, and asked what he was carrying there? he said it was a barge headfast, that he was watchman to Mr. Drew, a lighterman; and Mr. Drew's foreman gave it him to take to the London Docks. I secured him.

            . I am an officer, and was with Carter. I said I would take him to Mr. Drew's foreman; he then said he took it out of a barge opposite the Custom-house. I asked if he had made the barge fast? he said Yes. I went next morning to Mr. Everett.

            . I am a lighterman
, my barge was moored in the Custom-house road


, and had a headfast to it. I saw it safe at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 3d October. The rope could not get undone of itself. Next morning I found it adrift two or three hundred yards off, and the headfast gone, it was cut from the barge.

, and am a carpenter
. On the 17th of October, the prisoner came and took a room of me - she said, she was just married, and could give no reference but to her mother, and her mistress - on the Saturday following, when I came home I was told to go up stairs, and I missed the articles stated - the prisoner was then gone - I heard the next morning she was at the station-house, and there I found part of my property, which is here; I can swear to it.

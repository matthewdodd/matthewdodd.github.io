            . I am the wife of

            . I carried a red and white linen gown to Mrs. Mountain's to wash; I do not know the time; I believe it was about the 2 th of March; there was a fire next door to her; she took out a box of things and carried to a neighbour's where the prisoner was a servant; the things were lost out of her box.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Farrier, a pawnbroker. On the 3d of April I took in this gown (producing it) of 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Maddocks
               



             the prisoner; I lent her 8 s. upon it.
Q. How long was this after the fire?
Collins. Five or six days; she said it was her own
Prosecutor. It is my gown; I know it by a hole in the skirt.

Ann Mountain. I am a washer-woman: I have seen the gown produced; it is the gown I received of 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Biggs
               



            : there was a fire next door to me; I removed the things that were in a box, the prisoner was servant at the house to which I removed them; I missed the things the day after; a shirt, a sheet, and a gown. I found the sheet at a pawnbroker's in Long-acre, and the shirt in Broad-street, Covent-garden, but neither of the pawn-brokers are here.

                   Tims
               



            . I had been a fellow servant with the prisoner; she brought these things to the house where I live, and said she was coming from her place; I was going to Covent-garden market and saw her go into this pawnbroker's: that is all I have to say.
Prisoner's Defence.
Tims came to our house; I gave her the bundle, and she took it home with her; when I called for it in about an hour or two; she said an acquaintance had it; and she could not give it me.

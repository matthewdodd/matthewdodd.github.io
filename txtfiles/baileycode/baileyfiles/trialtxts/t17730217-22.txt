            . The prisoner picked me up; I went into a house to her lodgings; I went up stairs with her; there was another girl with her at the time; I gave that girl sixpence to fetch some liquor, that occasioned my putting my hand in my pocket; I found my purse safe at that time; there was in it three guineas and a quarter; about ten minutes after that I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse; between the time of taking out the sixpence and the time I found it missing, I had been upon the bed with the prisoner; I searched about the bed and it was not there nor in the room; upon charging her with it she made no answer but ran down stairs and endeavoured to escape; I did not see her for two days afterwards.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the money, the other girl took it.

JAMES CATHIE
. I live in East-street, Manchester-square. On the 15th of February, about one o'clock, I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner take a piece of bacon from the shop of Mr. Clark, and run away—I took hold of him and asked what he had under his coat, and he gave me this globe and kaleidescope from. under his coat, and said a boy gave them to him—I took him to the station-house, and the policeman found the owner.





JOHN HAMILTON
. I live with Charles Danielli in Oxford-street. I know this globe and kaleidescope to be his—I have the top part of the globe with me—it was against a glass case inside the door—the kaleidescope was outside—I did not miss them till the policeman brought them.

Prisoner's Defence. As I was walking along, a boy put these things into my cap.

Prisoner's Defence. I went into a public-house in St. Martin's-lane, and saw a man, who stated himself to be a distressed tradesman, and wished me to purchase this silver - I did not want it, but, after some persuasion, I said if he liked to pawn them, I would give so much more for the duplicates; he waited outside while I went and pawned them; I gave him 12s. for the tickets, and was going to redeem the desert-spoon, when I was stopped.

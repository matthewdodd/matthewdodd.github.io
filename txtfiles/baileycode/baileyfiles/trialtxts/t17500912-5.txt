            . I live in Old-Street


. On the 14th of July, about ten o'clock at Night, I was at supper with my lodger above stairs; I was call'd down, and I found my wife had been in pursuit of the prisoner, who with assistance had brought her back to my house, where she fell down on her knees and ask'd forgiveness.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I was coming down stairs, and saw the prisoner in my entry with a bundle in her apron. I went after her, and

             with me, I took her in Crosby-square; I took hold on her, and ask'd her how she came by these things; she said a woman gave her them to hold while she went to some place hard by, and also three halfpence for holding them. First she said her name was

            , and after that she said it was Baily. (The goods were produced in court and depos'd to) and that they were taken from out of the prosecutor's house.

             confirmed Mrs. Smith's testimony of the prisoner being taken with the goods upon her.
Prisoner's Defence. I met a woman in Old-street, she told me she had been a harvesting. Said she, I wish I was in your condition, for you are a widow, for mine is a very bad husband. Said she, if you will hold this bundle, here is three halfpence to drink a pint of beer, and when I come back again I will pay you for your trouble.

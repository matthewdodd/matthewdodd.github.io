JOHN AXTELL
 and 




GEORGE AXTELL
 were indicted for

 burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of

12th of Jan., at 
Middle Temple, with intent to steal the goods and chattels in the same; and that they had been before convicted of felony.


MR. SIMON
conducted the Prosecution.






EDWARD WISE
. I am a barrister-at-law; I have chambers at No. 2, Middle Temple-lane, and sleep there; it is very near to Fleet-street, just below the stationer's-shop. On Sunday evening, the 12th of Jan. I was tired, having taken a long walk, and went to bed earlier than usual, at a few minutes after nine o'clock—I had distinctly heard the clock strike

nine before I went to bed—my chambers are on the first landing-place, fifteen steps from the bottom—there is an outer door to my chambers, which opens outwards, and fastens with a latch-key, and immediately inside that an inner door, which opens inwards—I locked the outer door before I went to bed, and went again to see that it was fastened—these two doors open into a lobby—there are folding-doors which open from my bed-room into the sitting-room, and they were quite open—the outer door, which was locked, is easily opened—this is the key which opens it—after I had been in bed ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I heard a noise at the outer door, as of some one trying the lock—no suspicion passed my mind, for, having been out of town the previous evening, I thought it probable my laundress was coming to see that the fires were laid, or to bring something for me the next day—I listened, and presently the outer door opened—I then heard the inner door open—there is no lock on that; still no suspicion crossed my mind, it being so early in the evening—I then heard in the lobby, which is on the same level with my bed-room, a rustling noise—supposing it was the laundress, I called her name, Mrs. Banting—no answer being made, I instantly concluded it was some person attempting to come in improperly—I jumped out of bed, crying, "Stop thief!"—I went through the door at the bottom of my bed, so that I had no turning to make—I rushed through the doors, which were all open, and followed the noise of persons whom I heard going down the stairs, hallooing at the top of my voice all the way down, not having stopped for a second to put on my slippers or anything—my impression was that there was more than one person—at the bottom of the staircase is a lamp—I turned my eyes towards Fleet-street gate, and it was shut—it is always shut on Sundays—I stood at the bottom of the stairs till Mr. Gingell and Mr. Green both came up—I am confident that no person could have gone out at the Fleet-street gate without my seeing them—the prisoners were brought back in a short time into my chambers.





WILLIAM TWINING
. I am a watchman of the Middle Temple. On Sunday night, the 12th of Jan., I was on duty in Brick-court, which forms part of Middle Temple-lane—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," about a quarter-past nine—I am quite sure it was after nine—the cry proceeded from the top of the lane near Temple-bar—I looked up the lane and saw two persons running down the lane towards me, from the top of Temple-lane—I went across Brick-court to meet them—in coming along there are two lamps—in crossing I got near to them, and could see them plainly—they went across Brick-court into Essex-court—along the top passage, from Essex-court to another passage into New-court (there is in New-court a small wicket-gate which opens into Devereux-court, which a person might get out at if it were open—it is open on Sunday morning till eleven, but it is shut afterwards—it was then locked, and no person could get out) I followed them to the end of the passage, and saw them returning from the gate—knowing they could not get out, I came back to Middle Temple-lane, and went round by the Hall into Garden-court, where I saw the prisoners coming up the steps, walking separately, one on one side, the other on the other—I laid hold of both of them—I can swear that they are the boys I saw come down Middle Temple-lane, and whom I had been chasing—the prisoner George had an open collar on, the same as he has now—Haddon, another watchman, was with me—he went through the lower passage into Brick-court—Gingell, the head-porter,

came down to me the moment I took the prisoners—he took the prisoner John—I took the other, and we went to Mr. Wise's chambers—when I first saw the prisoners they were not more than ten yards from Mr. Wise's chambers—they were then between the two lamps.

John Axtell. Q. Did you make any cry when you pursued us? A. No, I did not.

COURT. Q. When you first saw them were there any other persons passing? A. There were no other persons near—they were the only persons that came into Brick-court—I did not see where Mr. Wise was—I saw the prisoners almost as soon as I heard the cry of "Stop thief."





JOHN HADDON
. I am a watchman of the Middle Temple—I was on duty on Sunday night at a little after nine—I was standing at the lower side of Brick-court, nearest to the river—I distinctly heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I looked up Middle Temple-lane, and saw the two boys coming down the lane towards me—they had got almost to the corner of Brick-court when I first saw them—I pursued them—they turned into Essex-court—I went into Essex-court—Twining was ahead of me—he turned back—I went on to the gate which opens to Essex-street—it was shut—I turned back, and saw the two prisoners going down the steps which lead to the fountain—they went straight down, and by the time I got down, Twining had come up to them—he had run round—I cannot ran so fast as he can.

John Axtell. Q. Were you with Twining when the cry of "Stop thief" was first made? A. No, I did not make any cry.





CHARLES GINGELL
. I am head-porter of Middle Temple. On Sunday evening, the 12th of Jan., about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, I heard Mr. Wise cry out—I went out and saw him at the bottom of his stairs in his shirt—I found the two prisoners, and Twining and Haddon, together—I went up with them to Mr. Wise's chambers—I found a candle in John Axtell's pocket, and on George Axtell some lucifer matches, two marbles, and three lumps of loaf sugar.





JOHN SPEAKMAN
 (City police-constable No. 329.) I was called to take charge of the prisoners—I received the candle and lucifer matches from Mr. Gingell—I searched John Axtell, and found on him this small key—the prisoners told me they lived in Great New-street—I went there—the person I saw there said she was their mother—I found this bunch of keys in their drawer in the lower room—one of the keys on this bunch opens Mr. Barkin's chambers in the Temple, which had been robbed previously to this—the key I found on John Axtell will not open Mr. Wise's door—it opens with a latch-key—the gardener found one key in the Temple, but it does not open Mr. Wise's door.





HENRY AYTON
. I keep the small gate which opens from Essex-court to Devereux-court—it is locked at eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, and continues so till eight on Monday morning.

J. Axtell's Defence. I have a sister who has left my mother for three years, and is not on good terms with her; I have been in the habit, unknown to my mother, of taking candles and other things to her; on that evening I left home with the intention of taking that candle to my sister; it was not broken then; my mother often told my brother not to go to my sister; he had been out that night to the chapel in Bedford-row; as I was going down the street I met him; he said he would go with me; I told him he should not go; he said he would; I said then I would not go; I said I

would go and meet my mother, who lives in chambers in Fig-tree-court, in the Temple; Mr. Wise went and found my mother; when we went into the Temple, it was ten minutes after nine; Inner Temple-lane is rather on a slant; I was running, and my brother trying to catch me; I turned into Brick-court, and heard the cry of "Stop thief," once or twice, but could not tell where it came from; I found I could not get out; I turned back, when the porter took hold of us; there was no cry of "Stop thief" then, and I was not aware that any one was pursuing me; the witness stated at Guildhall that he did not lose sight of us half a minute; there were no instruments found on us; the man was called from the gate, and very probably persons might go out; there are chambers all about there where persons might hide themselves.

G. Axtell's Defence. The matches I had were to let off some fire-works; and hearing a cry of "Stop thief," I threw the fire-works over the gate.

COURT
to
HENRY AYTON. Q. Have any fire-works been found near the gate? A. I lock the gate inside, I do not go outside—we made inquiries whether anything was heard of, or seen, and have heard of none.





GEORGE GREEN
. I heard the alarm of "Stop thief," and from that time till the prisoners were secured, not a person went out or in at the Fleet-street gate—I did not move from the place—the foot of the staircase of Mr. Wise's chamber is eighteen yards from the gate—I could look down distinctly, but the prisoners had taken to the left before I heard the alarm.





WILLIAM SICKLE
 (City police-constable, No. 290.) I produce a certificate of the conviction of the two prisoners, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I know them both—I was present at their trial—they are the persons who were then convicted—(read—Convicted on the 16th of Sept., 8th Vict., and imprisoned fourteen days.)

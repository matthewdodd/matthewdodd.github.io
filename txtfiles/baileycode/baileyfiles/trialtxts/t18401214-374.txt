CHARLES WATSON
 and 



HENRY BURNS
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
9th of December, 1 pair of breeches, value 3s., the goods of 



Hymen Levy.






HYMEN LEVY
. I keep a shop at Stratford. On Wednesday afternoon

I missed these breeches from my counter—I ran to the pawnbroker's, and found Burns with them—they took Watson, and brought him in, and Burns said to Watson, "You know you stole them, and gave them to me to pawn"—Watson said it was no such a thing.





GEORGE SMITH
 (police-constable K 38.) On Thursday morning last I was taking the prisoners to the Magistrate, and Burns said to Watson, "You know I did not steal the trowsers, I did not go in and steal them; you went in"—Watson said, "I know I did; I gave them to you to pawn; if they transport us it may be a very good thing"—Watson said he had been five times in prison—Burns laughed, and said, "You know you stole some handkerchiefs and pawned them in London, and I will tell of it."





EDMUND CHAMNESS
 (police-constable K 138.) On Wednesday I went to Mr. Brass's, a pawnbroker's shop, and found the two prisoners detained, for offering these breeches.

Watson's Defence. I never took them; Burns said to me, at the station, "If they ask who took them, you say you did."

Burns. I did not say so; he took them, and gave them to me to pawn.

WATSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

BURNS—


NOT GUILTY

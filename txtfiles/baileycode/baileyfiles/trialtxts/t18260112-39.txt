JOHN RAGAN. I am a pig-dealer
, and live in Essex. On the 17th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Smithfield


; my boy put my great coat into the cart in the market - he called out that a boy had run away with it. I found the prisoner at the Compter with it in half an hour after - my glove was in the pocket.

            . I am fifteen years old, and am servant to John Ragan. I put the coat into the body of the cart near Long-lane, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner take it - I am certain of him. I hallooed out to master, and he turned down a court in Long-lane - I lost him for about twenty minutes, but am sure of him.

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. Driscoll made an alarm, and in five minutes I saw the prisoner in Well-street, Cripplegate, running with the coat on his arm - I gained on him, and he dropped it; I put it into a baker's shop and took him. Driscoll was certain of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

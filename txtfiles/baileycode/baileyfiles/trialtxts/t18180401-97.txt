. On the 28th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I found the prisoner in my parlour, by the cupboard. I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted Mr. Scott - I told him he did not live there. I missed the milkpot-it was found in his pocket. He must have taken it out of the cupboard.

The prosecutor keeps the Queen's Heads in Dark-house Lane, Billingsgate




, and takes in parcels for the Gravesend boats. A parcel containing four dozen pair of pattens was left at his house, which he delivered to the waterman; some time after the waterman brought in the prisoner, and charged him with stealing the pattens. The waterman deposed that the parcel was broke open, and he met the prisoner with some of the pattens in his hand, and secured him.
The prisoner, in his defence, said, that he bought them of a man in Darkhouse Lane.

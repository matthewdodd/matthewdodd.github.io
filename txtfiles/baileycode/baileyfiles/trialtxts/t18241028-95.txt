            . I am a watchman. On the 1st of October, about twelve o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in Whitecross-street, with a bundle under her arm, and asked what was in it; she said it was a pair of blankets - I took her to the watch-house. Morran afterwards claimed them.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in Finsbury-square, and asked a man the way to Smithfield; he said, turn to the right, and said,
"Here, lay hold of this bundle while I go over the way." I went on till the watchman took me - I said a man had given them to me.

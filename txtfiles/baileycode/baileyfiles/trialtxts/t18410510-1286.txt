WILLIAM HARRY WOODALL
. I am a woollen-draper, and live in Bishopsgate Without; the prisoner was in my service for fifteen months. On the evening of the 21st of April, she went out and did not return—I examined my plate-basket in the morning, and missed some plate marked "W E W"—I sent for the prisoner's sister, and in her presence broke open the prisoner's box, in her bed-room—I found in it a piece of woollen cloth, a candlestick, some brown-holland, some black silk serge, and other articles of mine, and eight or nine duplicates—I have lost 50l. or 60l. worth of property altogether.





JAMES SULLIVAN
. I am in the service of Mr. Jerome, a pawnbroker—I produce some cloth, and two spoons, pawned by the prisoner on the 12th of April—I have also a variety of other articles pawned by her.





GEORGE WORLEY
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce two remnants of kerseymere, and one remnant of cloth, pledged by the prisoner on the 21st of January and 18th of February—on the 20th of April, she brought me another piece of cloth—I asked where she got it—she said she and her husband had bought several of these remnants to go to America—I sent out to make inquiry where she said she lived, and while I was engaged in another part of the shop she made her escape.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

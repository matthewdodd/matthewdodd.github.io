            , we live in Carnaby-market


, the prisoner was our servant
. On the 4th of December I took my pocket-book out of a drawer, and counted the notes that were in it - I had four 5 l. Bank notes - I put them into the drawer again and locked it. On Wednesday night I missed two 5 l. notes. Next morning I got an officer, who searched the prisoner's box and found in it a silver pencil-case, a tobacco-stopper, some satin, two handkerchiefs, a gold pin, and an iron-holder. I can swear that the blue satin was in the drawer with the notes.
JAMES ALEXANDER. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's box and her pockets. I found two keys, one of them opened the drawer where the money was, the other was the key of her box. I found the things mentioned, and 20 s. in silver, but no notes.

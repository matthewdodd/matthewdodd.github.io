            . On the 13th of January, as I was going down Bridges-street


 into Catherine-street


, I met the prisoner, and the moment he met me, he snatched my watch out of my pocket - it was near one o'clock; I was coming from the theatre - there were no persons about but him; I called Stop thief! he ran across the road; I pursued and caught him - he dropped the watch directly; I had not lost sight of him; I was not five yards from him.
JOHN PENNY. I am a Police-constable; I took the prisoner, and the prosecutor gave me this watch.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of the play-house, and heard Stop thief! called; I came across the street; four or five gentlemen stopped and picked up the watch; it is a thing impossible that he could see me - the street was crowded with people, and there were four or five ranks of coaches.
JOHN PENNY. There were people on the other side of the way, but none about that particular spot.

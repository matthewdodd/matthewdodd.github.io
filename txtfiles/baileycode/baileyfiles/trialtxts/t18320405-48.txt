            . I live in Wellington-street, Camden-town


. On the evening of the 28th of March, I was sitting at my kitchen window, smoking my pipe; my house is within two doors of Mr. Early's, of whom I have my deer, and there was one of his pots just inside mytails - I saw the prisoners come up - Weldon took up the pot, and passed it on to Parsons; they stooped together, and hid one another - I ran out, and watched them, but I did not see an officer till I got on the other side of Cumberland-market; I then gave them in charge, and three pots were found on Parsons.

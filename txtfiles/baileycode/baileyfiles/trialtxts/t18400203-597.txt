JAMES CHURCHLOW
. I am shopman to Mr. William Palmer, a woolen draper, in the City-road. On the 7th of January, about five minutes past six o'clock, the prisoner and another young man were standing outside the window talking together for four or five minutes—they then both came in together—the prisoner asked me to show him some buttons which were in the window—while I was stooping to get them, the other one who stood behind the prisoner, took the roll of cloth from a shelf, and in going out he struck the door—I jumped over the counter, and could not see him—the prisoner tried to make his escape, and said, "Why don't you run after him, you will catch him?"—the 'prisoner said his name was George Williams, that he was a writer and grainer, living in Hackney-road, and at the station-house he said his name was George Coston—he said his family were respectable—the cloth was worth 2l. 13s.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many persons were in the shop? A. Only myself—Mr. Palmer was up stairs at tea—the officer took the prisoner to the station-house.





WILLIAM DAMEN
 (police-constable G 161.) I was called about a quarter-past six o'clock on the 7th of January, and took the prisoner—he said his name was George Williams, and when he was at the station-house he said it was George Costan.

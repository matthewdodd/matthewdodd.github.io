            , JUN. I live at Harlington, about three miles from Hounslow, in Middlesex


. I know the prisoners - two of them had been in the habit of selling potatoes about our place, at a very cheap rate. On the night of the 16th of December I lost about fourteen sacks of potatoes out of a barn; I have not seen any of them since: I was examined at the time these men were committed - I heard 
               
                  William 
                  Best
               



             examined; what he said was taken down in writing, and read over to him and the Magistrate signed it; I think Cordery had not been examined, in their presence, before that.


                  WILLIAM 
                  FLETCHER
               



            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I was at work in his barn on the 16th of December; 
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



            , 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Cordery
               



            , and Wooldridge came in together -
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



             said, "This used to be the potato barn - are there any here now?" I said Yes, and pointed to where they were; there were twenty-six or twenty-seven sacks: they did not say any thing more, but went away - the next morning I went to work about six o'clock; I got the key from the farm, and went to the barn: I opened the front door - when I got in, the barley was all scattered about the place; I got a light, and then missed about fourteen sacks of potatoes: I found the back door of the barn had been broken off the hinges.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you knowJames Best? A. Yes; he had lived two years with Mr. Shackle.


                  GEORGE 
                  WOOLDRIDGE
               



            . I am a labourer, and live at Harlington. On the 16th of December I went with 
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



             and Cordery to the prosecutor's barn, and saw Fletcher there; Best said, "This used to be the potato barn," and Fletcher pointed out where the potatoes were; we went away together, and Best said, "Some of those potatoes are mine to-night, I'll he d - d if they arn't," - he asked if I would go with him, and help him get them out at night - I said I would have nothing to do with it; he offered me 3s. 6d., and plenty to eat and drink if I would. I passed that barn the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, and the door was off the hinges, but it stood up; Cordery and 
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



             were with me - I said, "Halloo, Mr. Best, then you have been there;" he made no answer.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the owner of these potatoes? A. Yes - I did not go to tell him: I did not like to make a disturbance; I had no other reason - I am a farmer's man; I told my father the next morning - he was at work just by the barn. I was never in any thing of this kind before - I told my father, and he told another person.


                  JOSEPH 
                  CORDERY
               



            . I am a labourer, and live at Harlington. On the 16th of December I went to the prosecutor's barn, with Wooldridge and 
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



            ; Best said to Fletcher, "This was the potato barn - are there any here now?" Fletcher said, "Yes, there are a few;" when we came away Best said he would give us 3s. 6d. a piece, and plenty to eat and drink, if we would go with him that night - Wooldridge said, "I never did the like yet, and I will not;" I said I did not like to go, but he said I had better, I was sure not to get caught; I went at twelve o'clock at night, with 
               
                  William 
                  Best
               



             and the other prisoners- they hoisted the door off its hinges, and I stood by; 
               
                  William 
                  Best
               



            's horse and cart, and 
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



            's donkey and cart were there; I went and helped to pick up the potatoes, and put them into a basket - that was all I did; they shot them into sacks - there were fourteen sacks filled: they put them into the carts, and went off; I got the 3s. 6d. about a week afterwards. I was apprehended, and taken before the Magistrate at Uxbridge - I stated what I have to-day; I have been five weeks at the House of Correction, and came from there to-day.
Cross-examined. Q. These people paid you very badly- I suppose you were vexed at that? A. Yes, but I took the money; I never did the like before - I thought there was harm in it; Wooldridge was present when 
               
                  James 
                  Best
               



             asked me to help him - Mr. Newman came and said he would forgive me if I would tell him, and I told him. I swear I never was tried for stealing ducks, nor accused of it.


                  WILLIAM 
                  FLETCHER
               



             re-examined. Q. You missed this quantity of potatoes the next morning? A. Yes - it was in the wet weather; I did not see any marks of wheels- it is a gravelly soil.
MR. PHILLIPS to 
               
                  GEORGE 
                  WOOLDRIDGE
               



            . Q. Were you never in any thing of this kind before? A. No; I was in service, and drove a team of horses over three ducks; the woman went and got a warrant for me - I asked her if she would make it up; she said she would if I paid for them - I said if I paid for them I should like to have them, and I took them; I was not tried for stealing them.

            . I am in the ninth year of my age -I know I must always speak the truth. My mother, Mary Waller, brought my breakfast in this can - we took our breakfast, and the 6s. were put into the can; the prisoner took it, and said she was going to take home a quart of milk for my mother - I began crying, and said she took my mother's money away; this was at the milk-house gate, in St. James'-park - a gentleman spoke to me, and he ran after her; a Police-man caught her - I did not see her stopped; a great crowd pursued her - I am quite sure she is the person who took the can, and the person who was stopped.

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty in St. James'-park - I saw the crowd, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner at the head of the crowd with this can in her hand; this little girl said she had got her can and 6s. in it, all in sixpences.

            . The prisoner sent me to the baker's, Miss Hammonds, and to say my mother had sent me for 6s.; she gave it me, and the prisoner took it.
Prisoner's Defence. I spoke to this woman in the Park, and asked her for a lodging - she told me to come on the Monday; I did, and then she said she was going home to take a drop of coffee for her children - I went with her, and she left the can with them to get their breakfast; she then took me to a public-house; I said if she knew a man who could fetch my boxes, I should be glad - she sent one; I asked her for 6d. to pay him - she said, "I never lend money, ask my little girl to go to the baker's to borrow 6d.;" I went with the little girl, and stood outside till she went in to borrow the 6d. - she came out, and handed the can to me; I took it; she was frightened, and screamed - I was making all the haste I could, and heard the money rattle; I found there was 6s. 6d. in it - I put this money in my pocket, and went on; the Police-officer came up, and said I had robbed her.

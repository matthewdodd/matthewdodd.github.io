            . I live in New-street, Shoe-lane


; the prisoner came to live with me last Friday was a week; on the Wednesday following I found a key was broke in one of my drawers. I called her up into my room, and asked her if she knew any thing of that key; she said, she did not. My wife went up stairs to examine her things; we opened her box, and found the things mentioned in the indictment. As I missed a great many things that we could not find, I desired my wife to search her. We found a bunch of keys under her stays, there was about sixteen or eighteen keys. I charged a constable with her; we found there had been nineteen drawers, boxes, and trunks opened. She confessed stealing my things before my Lord Mayor; she said she had the keys of a person over the water.

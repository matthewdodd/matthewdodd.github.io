WILLIAM SMITH
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of August, 6 brushes, value 13s. 6d., the goods of 



Harriet Frances Batchelor.






HARRIET FRANCES BATCHELOR
. I am single, and live in Quebec-street, New-road. On the 20th of August the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to look at a set of shoe-brushes—I showed him some—he said he wanted larger ones—I showed him two other sets—he looked at them, and said he did not know which the parties would like, if I had any body to send with him to No. 15, in the Grove—a little girl was standing by my side—she said she knew where he said they were to go, and she would go—I gave two sets of brushes to the little girl, and have not seen them since, nor the prisoner, till he was in custody.





SARAH ANN GREEN
. I was sent with some brushes—the prisoner was with me—he took me round the New-road, and at the corner he said, "Give me the brushes, I will wait here while you go and fetch the other set"—I gave them to him—he wrapped them up in a blue pocket-handkerchief—when I came back he was gone—I saw him afterwards going up the Harrow-road—I knew him again directly.

Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of it.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years longer.

SAMUEL HANBURY
. At the time in question I lodged at Mr. Solomon's, in Lamb's Conduit-street. The prisoner was servant of the house from about the end of July until the beginning of August, when I left—I thought her honest, and she was a good cook—she had given notice to Mrs. Solomons to quit, and I took her with me to my house—she remained with me about five weeks, and I discharged her—I had missed this property while I was in Lamb's Conduit-street.





WILLIAM KING
,. I am a pawnbroker, and live in High Holborn. I have four remnants of carpet, a sheet, and two table-cloths, which were pawned by the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

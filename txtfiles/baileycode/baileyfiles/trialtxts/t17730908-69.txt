            . I am a baker
 in Fleet-street: I was sent for before the aldermen, and asked if that was my bread; it was on the 2d of September; the prisoner was there; the bread was produced there; I am sure it was mine. I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . I took the prisoner in Cheapside, with a baker's basket and four loaves; I knew it was not his; I laid hold of him and secured him till the baker came.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

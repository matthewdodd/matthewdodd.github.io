MARY ANN GALLOWAY



, stealing 1 watch, value 30s.; the goods of 



Thomas Burke, from his person: having been before convicted.






THOMAS BURKE
. I live in the Edgeware-road. On 31st July, between one and two o'clock in the morning I was with some friends, I met the prisoner, and went with her into a house of bad character—I stayed some

time, and when I came out she told me to go away home as there were so many constables about—I missed my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—this is it—(produced).

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN. Q. Had you been drinking? A. I had had a drop, but was not intoxicated—before I met her I had been enjoy-ing myself with my friends—I parted from them about one o'clock—I had not spoken to any other woman that night—I never saw the prisoner before—I had my watch when I went into the house—she came out with me—I saw no one else at the house but the landlady—I made an alarm—the prisoner was taken in, less than five minutes, in bed, at her lodgings.





DANIEL BRUM
 (policeman, E 67). A little before two o'clock I received information, and went to the prisoner's lodgings, which was about 200 yards from where I met the prosecutor—when I went to her door I believe the window was put np—after a little time the door was answered—a man afterwards picked np the watch, about twenty yards from the window—she had an opportunity of throwing it from the window.

Cross-examined, Q. How many live in the house? A. Four or five women—I believe the prisoner got out of bed to open the door—I had seen her going home a few minutes before.





ROBERT BAILEY
. About seven o'clock in the morning I found a watch on a dung-heap, about twenty yards from the window.





THOMAS WARREN
 (policeman). I produce a certificate—(read—


Catherine King, convicted Feb, 1848, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the woman.




GUILTY
.** Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

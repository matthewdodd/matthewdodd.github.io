JOHN HOWARD. I am a builder
. On the 27th of February, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I was informed that something wrong was going on at one of the buildings in Middleton-street, Spafields


. I went there, opened the door, and met the prisoners in the house-both of them had sashes under their arms - I took them to Hatton-garden. The sashes were taken from the back premises. The prisoners were not employed there.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

ALFRED FREEMAN
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 coat, value 1l.; 2s.; 2 waistcoats, 13s.; 2 handkerchiefs, 3s.; 1 stock, 2s.; 1 razor, 3s.; 1 breast-pin, 8s.; 1 pair of boots, 4d.; 2 stockings, 4d.; 1 snuff-box, 2d.; and 1 tobacco-pouch, 2d.; the goods of 



John Phipps; having been before convicted of felony.






JOHN PHIPPS.
 I lodge at the Kenilworth Castle, King-street, Islington—I went there, leaving the articles stated at the Star Coffee-house locked up—I returned there on Friday, the 24th of Sept., found the place broken open, and the things gone—these now produced are part of them.





HARRIET RICHARDSON.
 The prisoner formerly lodged with me at the Star coffee-house—he came back, and asked for a lodging for three nights—he slept in the room where the prosecutor had slept—no one slept there but the

prisoner—I know these articles were locked in a closet in that room when the prisoner came—they were taken away, and I found a chisel was taken from another closet—I know these things are the prosecutor's—he has worn them in my house.

Prisoner. If I had had the property which is laid to my charge I must have had them about me when I came away; and when I went out of your house in the morning, did you see anything on me? Witness. No.





CHARLES RANDALL
 (policeman, N 172.) I took the prisoner in Old-street—he was wearing this waistcoat, this handkerchief, this stock, and boots—in his coat-pocket he had this pin, which he tried to throw away—I found in his pocket this snuff-box and tobacco-box.

Prisoner. If I had stolen these things the woman must have seen me with them; I was dressed as I am now.





WILLIAM BUTCHER
 (police-serjeant, N 17.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 3rd March, 1845, and confined one year)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM COOPER. On the 20th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Oxford-street


 - I met three women near the Regent's-circus; one of them advanced before the others, and said something to me, but I do not know what; I passed on and immediately the other two came in front of me, and one of them, with an oath, said something, and snatched my watch out of my fob - the others turned round behind me, and all three closed upon me; I caught hold of the one who I believed took my watch - that was not the prisoner, though I am certain she was one - I noticed her particularly; the watchman came up; I said I had been robbed of my watch, and I believed that was one of the girls - he pursued and took the prisoner with the watch in her hand - she had hold of the girl's arm who came in front of me; I was not drunk; I had left my stable to get a glass of gin-and-water, with nitre in it.

            . I am a watchman. I was in Oxford-street on the 20th of April - I saw the three girls hustling the prosecutor - two of them stuck to him, and the prisoner ran away - I pursued her, and took the watch from her hand, without losing sight of her, in Regent-street.

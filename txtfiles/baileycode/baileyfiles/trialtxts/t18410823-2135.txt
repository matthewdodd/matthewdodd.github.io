LOUISA HIGGS
. I am the wife of Thomas Higgs; we live in Providence-place, Tash-street. On the 21st of July I was at Mr. Reed's, the pawnbroker, in Gray's Inn-lane—I had been there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the prisoner came and stood very near my side—I felt her hand go from my side, but I did not know that she took it out of my pocket—she went to the door—I felt, and missed my money—I had had in my pocket three half-crowns, four pence, two halfpence, and a farthing—I looked, and the prisoner was looking towards me—she then ran, I ran after her, nearly to the top of Gray's Inn-lane, and there the policeman took her, when I cried "Stop thief"—she threw the money out of her hand at the policeman's feet.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not accuse a young woman of it in the mob? A. No, I accused nobody but you.





GEORGE TOWNSEND
 (police-constable E 113.) I saw the prisoner stopped—the prosecutrix accused her of stealing three half-crowns, four pence, two halfpence, and a farthing.





HENRY HAYWOOD
 (police-constable E 97.) The prosecutrix gave me charge of the prisoner—I stopped her in Gray's Inn-lane—she denied having the money, and said she went to pledge a ring—directly I pursued her she dropped three pence out of her left hand, and the remainder out of her right hand—three half-crowns, two penny-pieces, and one farthing, which my brother officer picked up.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask what money she lost, and did she not say she did not know till she went back, and you told her what was picked up? A. The prosecutrix said she lost three half-crowns and the coppers.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

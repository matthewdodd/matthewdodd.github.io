 for stealing, on the

JOHN DAVIS
. I am a carpenter, and live in Queen-street, Seven Dials. The prisoner was a stranger to me—he met me on the 6th of August, and solicited charity—he said he was very hungry, and had not eaten any thing that day—I gave him some bread and cheese, and part of a pint of beer, at the Black Horse, Queen-street, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—he laid he wanted a night's lodging—I said I would pay for a bed, or part of one—we went to bed together at half-past nine o'clock—I was awoke in the morning, and the prisoner was gone, in a suspicious way—I looked over the bed, and missed my Blucher boots—I got up, and went and looked after the prisoner, and saw him running in King-street—he had just turned the corner of Queen-street—I called out, "Stop him"—he was stopped by a person, and the constable came to me with my boots—these are my boots.





ISAAC KEENE
 (police-sergeant F 2.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief" on the morning of the 7th, about half-past seven o'clock—I ran in the direction the prisoner ran, and picked up these boots—I took the prisoner—he acknowledged he dropped them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

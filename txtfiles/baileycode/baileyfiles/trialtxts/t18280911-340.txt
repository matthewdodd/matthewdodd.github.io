ELIZABETH WILLIAMS. I am single
. I lost my gown, on the 12th of July, from a back parlour, in Bowling-street, Clerkenwell


; it was taken out at the back window, which I had left a little way open - I had seen it at five o'clock that evening, when I went out: I returned in half an hour- the prisoner lived next door.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a gown pawned with me on the 12th of July; I am not quite certain of the prisoner's person, but I believe it was by her - I gave this duplicate for it.

            . I keep a little clothes-shop. On the 12th of July, the prisoner brought this duplicate to my house, and asked me to take care of it, as she was going to meet a gentleman; I said I would - there weeks after, the officer came to me, and I gave it to him.

            . I am an officer. I produce the duplicate which I got from this witness.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had taken the gown and pawned it to pay her rent, but intended to redeem it; that the prosecutrix was living in a state of adultery, and had perjured herself by giving the name of Clark at the office.

            . Aged 44.

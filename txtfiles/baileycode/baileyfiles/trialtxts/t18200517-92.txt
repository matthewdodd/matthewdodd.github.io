            . I am a constable of Fulham. On the 11th of April I found the pistol in the prisoner's possession at the White Horse, at Kensington. He said his grandfather died and left it to his uncle, and his uncle left it to him, and that he kept it to kill hares, when he could not catch them. It was loaded with slugs.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I found it on the Colebrook road. A man named Shepherd said it belonged to the Life Guards. I went by the Windsor barracks, and if I had stolen it I should not have passed there. I went to deliver it up at the barracks.

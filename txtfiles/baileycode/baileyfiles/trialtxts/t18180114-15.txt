SUSANNAH RIDGE. I am the wife of John Ridge, who lives in Edmund-street, Battle-bridge. On the 18th of December I went to see my mother, who was ill; at two o'clock I went out to get her a jelly, and when I returned I missed my ridicule off the table-the prisoner lodged in the house-she did not return home until two days after; when she came back I accused her of the robbery, and she gave me the duplicate. My mother was confined to her bed. I gave her in charge.
BENJAMIN COX. I am a pawnbroker. On the 18th of December I took the watch in pledge of a woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner, in the name of 
               
                  Charlotte 
                  Campbell
               



            . The duplicate produced is mine.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was intoxicated when I took it.

                  JOHN 
                  POMFRET
               



            . On the evening of the 5th of January I had been cutting some hay from the stack, and tied it up in bundles with some bands of rowen hay, which had been prepared by myself and my boy - my hay was full of clover which had grown among the grass; I left it at five or six o'clock - there were two large bundles of hay and a bundle of loose hay; I covered them up, and the next morning I and my boy went before seven o'clock and two large bundles were missing - I gave information to the constable, and in two or three hours Mr. 
               Tuck
             the farmer came; from his information I went to the constable, and went with him to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Cook
               



            's house - we found a large cupboard under the stairs, which was locked: 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



             was there - he said his father was out and he had the key in his pocket - we opened it and found some hay shookin loose; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Cook
               



             keeps a horse and cart - these bands we found there, which I twisted myself and can swear to them, and a great portion of hay was in one of the bands; I am able to state that it is a portion of the hay I left near my stack - 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



             was then taken, and Parsall a little time after; we took 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Cook
               



             on the road - he said, "I would not go to steal your hay;" I said,"No, but if you send your son and two others to do it it is the same" - he said he had a great quantity of hay brought into his cellar, and did not know how it came there; I heard the statements made by Parsall and John Cook before the Magistrate - it was read over to them; the whole of it is Dr. Robinson's writing - 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Cook
               



            's house is across a field and up a little passage from mine.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you a dealer in hay? A. No - I may by chance have sold some hay, but no bundles; I sold a quarter of a load from the same hay, but to Mr. Payne for his own horses - I have not sold any to any other person; I know it because it is mixed with clover, trefoil, and rye-grass - I swear to it by the bands more particularly; they are made of rowen - bands may generally be made of that, but this is what I rolled up for my own purpose; I thought any thing was good enough for the purpose - here is one of them; I can swear to that -
               
                  Thomas 
                  Cook
               



             keeps a horse; he was discharged without bail on his promising to come to the Angel the next day, which he did and was admitted to bail; there was a person of the name of Grimes, but he was not found.
RICHARD OAKLEY. I am a labourer. On the night of the 5th of January I saw John Cook and 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Grimes
               



             in Mr. Offwood's garden, about four hundred yards from the prosecutor's - they were coming out of the garden, and each had an arm-full of hay; they took it down Lloyd's yard, where 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Cook
               



            's house is - this was between seven and eight o'clock, as near as I can guess; Offwood's garden is between Pomfret's and Cook's.
Cross-examined. Q. Do many people live there? A. There are six houses in the yard; it was a moon-light night - it was not concealed; they brought it by me as I was in my mother's garden.

                  FOSTER
               



            . I am a constable of Tottenham. I went to Thomas Cook's, and found some hay in a cellar under the stairs; I locked up 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



            , and then went after the father - I took them before the Magistrate; what was said by Parsall and 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



             was taken down in writing by Dr. Robinson; he read it over to 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



            , and he put his name to it - this is it: - (read.)


                  JAMES 
                  PARSALL
               



             being asked by me what he had to say, and being previously cautioned, said, I had 8 1/2d. of the money; I have nothing else to say."
JOHN COOK being first cautioned, and told that what he said would be put down in writing, and made use of against him, at his trial, voluntarily and freely confesseth, and saith, "Last Tuesday evening, between six and seven o'clock, Hugh Grimes and James Parsall came to me while I was standing at the bottom of Brook-court, Tottenham, "where my father, Thomas Cook, lives; I live with my father: 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Grimes
               



             said to me, "Jack, have you a mind to go and get some hay;" 
               
                  James 
                  Parsall
               



             stood by at the time - I said I did not mind; 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Grimes
               



             then said he knew where he could get some, and asked if I would buy it; I said Yes; I, 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Grimes
               



            , and 
               
                  James 
                  Parsall
               



             then went to a field, at the bottom of Waggon and Horse-lane, belonging to 
               
                  John 
                  Pomfret
               



            , where there was a stack of hay - there were three bundles of hay tied up, lying close by the side of the stack; Hugh Grimes took one of the bundles, and lifted it over the fence, that surrounded the stack, which I took of him and laid it down - 
               
                  James 
                  Pursall
               



             took another bundle, and handed that over also to me; we left the third bundle where we found it, under the stack - 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Grimes
               



            , and 
               
                  James 
                  Parsall
               



             then came over the fence from the stack; Grimes and Parsall each took up a bundle of the hay, and carried them across the fields as far as the stile, and then I took the bundle of hay from Parsall, and carried it to the palings, next my father's yard -Grimes carried his bundle of hay all the way; I threw one bundle over the fence, belonging to Mr. Stevens who keeps the Coach and Horses ale-house, and Grimes threw over the other bundle into Mr. Offwood's garden, which adjoins my father's premises - I then fetched one of the bundles, and took it into my father's cellar; and Grimes took the other, and put it into the cellar; after the hay was in the cellar, I gave Grimes 2s. for it - my father was not at home at the time, and knew nothing of it. JOHN COOK.
Taken before me W. ROBINSON.

             said this? A. Yes; they were all told to listen to what was read - it was after 
               
                  John 
                  Cook
               



             made his statement that Parsall said he received 8 1/2d.
John Cook's Defence. My father was not at home at the time, or he would not have encouraged me in it; I fetched an arm-full of loose hay from Mr. Offwood's garden.

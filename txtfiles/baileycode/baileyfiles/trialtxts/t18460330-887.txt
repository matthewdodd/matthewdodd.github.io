FRANCES GUYATT
. I am a widow, and live at No. 6, Paul-street, Portman-market—the prisoner is my son—I placed my wearing apparel and other things in a neighbour's room for security, in consequence of so frequently losing it—on the 9th of March I went out to work at six o'clock in the morning—I returned at eight in the evening—I went to my box, and missed this calico, sheeting, flannel, coats, and other things—the coats and other clothes were my younger son's, Charles Guyatt—they were in my care—the things are all here, except two yards of flannel—when the prisoner came home, his brother said to him, "Now you shall go for this"—he said he did not care, the sooner the better.





FREDERICK HEADWORTH
. I live with Mr. Trail, a pawnbroker—I produce a gown, some flannel, and other things—they were pawned by the prisoner for 6s.—Mrs. Guyatt has identified them all.





JOSEPH GUENIE
 (police-constable S 340.) I took the prisoner—I asked him if it was he that took the things—he said he did not care, and he would be b----if I should not have some trouble with him before I got him to the station.





JOHN PHILLIPS
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 23rd of Oct., 1843, and confined two years)—the prisoner is the person.

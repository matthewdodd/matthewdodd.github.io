            . I live at Wandsworth. On the 13th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in King-street, Smithfield


, and felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner close to me, and the handkerchief on the ground, between us; it was impossible any body but him could have done it; as I stooped to take it up, he ran away, and was stopped by a gentleman, without my losing sight of him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Cow-lane - a bullock was running; I ran after it, and the gentleman stopped me.

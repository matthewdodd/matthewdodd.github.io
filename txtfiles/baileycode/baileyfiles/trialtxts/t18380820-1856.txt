MARIA WILLIAMS
. I am the wife of Jonathan Williams, and live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. On Saturday night, at a quarter past ten o'clock, on the 21st of July, I was in Church-street, Bethnal-green—I felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner's hand in my pocket-hole—I had there a half-crown, three shillings, and some halfpence—I accused her of picking my pocket—she turned to a companion she had with her, and said she had not—I examined my pocket, and all my money was gone—I had seen it there not two minutes before—I accused her again—she struck me, and ran away with a companion-an officer came, and took her.





SAMUEL BASS
. I live in Well-street, Mile-end, New-town. I was in Church-street about a quarter before ten o'clock—I saw Mrs. Williams, and saw the prisoner put her hand into the pocket-hole of her gown—the prosecutrix said, "You have picked my pocket"—she said she had not, and struck her—she ran a little way, and struck her again twice—we pusued, and took her—I saw several half-crowns, and some silver found on her when she was searched.

Prisoner, There was a row, and I went to see what it was, and then this woman said I had robbed her—she struck me, and I struck her again.

AMY ROBERTS. I took a coach to go to Islington. All of a sudden the springs of the coach were cut, and some one opened the door and removed the trunk, and when I enquired for my trunk, it was gone. The coachman said he knew nothing of it.
SAMUEL SHEPFARD. On Thursday the 29th of August. I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street. I saw the prisoner come out of Old Bedlam, with that trunk on his shoulder. He made across towards Houndsditch, and I ran after him; I stopped him; he then threw the trunk on me; I caught the trunk on my right arm, and caught him with my left. He struggled with me, and his clothes gave way, and he got from me and ran. I pursued him and took him to the compter.

            , aged 31.




               Transported for Seven Years

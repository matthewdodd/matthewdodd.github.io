WILLIAM STILES. I live in Tottenham-court-road, and am a silversmith
; I sell dressing-cases. On the 27th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I heard something, went out, and missed one from within a few feet of the door; a few days afterwards I found the prisoner in custody with it. I think I have seen him before, but know nothing of him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing St. Giles', and found the case in the middle of the road.
WILLIAM BERRY. It was quite clean, and new.

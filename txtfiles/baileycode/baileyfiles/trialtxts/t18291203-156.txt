AARON MENDES BELISARIO. On the 7th of November, as I was at the corner of George-yard, Whitechapel


, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner pulled my watch out of my fob, and ran away; I am lame, and could not follow him - no one followed him; there is a gas-light close by, and I noticed his person - as soon as he was gone I was surrounded by a gang of men, who said, "Have you been robbed, Sir?" and took hold of me to prevent my pursuing; I described the prisoner, and he was taken -I went to the office, saw him among a number of men, and knew him.

            . I took the prisoner on the 9th of November, from the prosecutor's description; I said it was for robbing a gentleman of his watch on Saturday night - he denied it.

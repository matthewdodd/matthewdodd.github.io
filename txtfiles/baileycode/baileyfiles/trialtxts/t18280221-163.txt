HENRY COMLEY. I am a farmer
, and live at Chingford



. On the 20th of January, I had some fowls in an out-house and some in a barn; the out-house was not locked, but the door they came in at, or went out at, was broken. I went to bed about ten o'clock on the Saturday night; I heard the cocks crow at three o'clock - I awoke my wife, and said "The wind rises." The carter came in the morning to do his horse, and he said the fowls were stolen - I got up as soon as I could, and missed six fowls and three geese; I went down into the yard and saw footsteps: I went and inquired at the public-house and saw the constable, he said they were the same footsteps as had been about almost every Saturday night. I followed the prisoners up to London, where I found an officer, and asked him where Lambeth-street Office was - I went with him to some alley; I lost the officer there, but he came to a public-house with the prisoners, and showed me a part of my fowls, which I knew by some private marks on them. I know Cardinell by the name of Ridley - he has lived at Chingford: I have seen Bean about once, but never spoke to him, and did not know where he lived.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Cardinell's parents? A. No. My son Edward was at home and in bed when the fowls were stolen - I do not know what time he went to bed: I went to bed first; I do not sleep in the same room; I saw him go up stairs to bed; he was called up by the servant in the morning - I heard the fowls at three o'clock, and they were safe atten o'clock - I did not lock them up. I dare say I had twenty fowls; I did not count them that night, but I saw them all safe on the roost. I was awake and heard the clock strike three, within a few minutes after I heard the fowls.
COURT. Q. What day in the week did you lose your fowls? A. On Monday, and I saw them before twelve o'clock on the same day at the office.

                  NORRIS
               



            . I am an officer. I received information from the prosecutor, and I went with his son, who said he could identify the persons - I went to several houses where I knew Cardinell had lived, I found where he was, and went to the house; I went up stairs, and found him and Bean in bed, and Ashton drawing a fowl - I saw a chest, and asked where the key was; Cardinell gave it me, and I took four fowls and two ducks out of it - I took them to the office, and went back and found one fowl in a saucepan, boiling on the fire. In consequence of something that Comley's son said to Bean, he told me that if I went to a turnip field, near Comley's, I should find three geese on the right hand side, under a hedge, I went and found them - I showed the fowls and geese to Comley; he swore positively to them, by some private marks on them.
Cross-examined. Q. Were the marks pointed out to you by Comley? A. I do not know - he swore he knew them by a private mark. I have got the fowls' feet at home, but did not bring them here - I first met the prosecutor's son near the office, at Lambeth-street; he appeared to know Bean and Cardinell. When he got into the room, he told them they were the last persons he should have suspected of such a thing, when he had been feeding them; there were preparations for dinner; the prisoners did not tell me that young Comley was coming to dine with them. Young Comley told Bean he would speak to his father to do something for him, to get him off, if he would tell where the geese were: the prisoners did not say Comley opened the barn door, and pointed out the fowls and geese, in the middle of the night - Comley said to them, "I did not think you would have done what you have, after what I gave you to eat and drink last night." I knew nothing of young Comley till he came to me. I have seen Cardinell about the Commercial-road with dogs - I do not know his family.
EDMUND COMLEY. I am the prosecutor's son. The fowls were safe on Saturday night, and on the following morning we missed them. I know the male prisoners. I had been to Woodford the day before, and as I returned between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I met Bean and Cardinell, between the Bull public-house and the swing-gate - Cardinell came behind me and struck me; he rubbed his hands and said,"Have you not got a bit of pork, or a bit of bacon to give us; I have not had a bit of grub all day." I said"Well, come to the King's Head public-house;" he said he would not - he would go to the Bull; I took Bean into the King's Head, he followed, and we had a pot of beer - one Morris came in; they went out - I said to the publican, "I won't to go home with them." I shut the door and hatched it - Cardinell shoved it open again; we then all went on - Cardinell said "Where are old Ash's geese;" I said "They are not here;" we went on; they broke off the top of a gate; I got over the gate to get away, as I was afraid my father would hear it. Cardinell asked me to lend him a fishing-net which I had - we went and dragged a brook which runs up to the river Lea. Cardinell hid the net; he then wanted to fight me; I went on with Morris, who put the gate up: I went home, and knocked; my father came down, and made a noise at me for being out late - I looked at the clock, and it wanted twenty-five minutes to two. I heard the cocks crow several times distinctly, and next morning the fowls were gone. I saw some footsteps of Cardinell's in the dung I can swear; I put a gate over it to keep it, and I found a bit of ran there which I had seen on Bean's hand; I then told my father we would go to London.
Cross-examined. Q. Your father did not go to bed at ten o'clock? A. I do not know; he generally does; Ashton's geese generally feed in our field, but were fetched away about seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoners were often at Chingford, and Bean has been at my father's house - I met them in Bull-lane; I took them to a public-house, because they said they were starving  - one of them said, "Shall I go and kill one of Newton's sheep?" I said No: and that was why I got my net. I parted with them in Cock Tyler's-lane; I did not go home immediately, as I thought they were going to break down our gate, and I watched with Morris. Cardinell said, "My aunt is very ill, if you can give us a fowl I shall be obliged to you?" I said,"I won't, for I won't get into any row or piece of work." I have given him the clothes off my back, when his father-in-law turned him out of doors.
Q. Did not you go with them to your father's house that night? A. No; we were in the lanes; I went into the cow-house, and got my net; we have a dog called Ranger - I said nothing about him that night - I did not notice him till I went home; I did tell the prisoners not to make a noise, as my father would hear, as they kicked up a row - I did not say I would get rid of Morris, and tell them to stand behind the gate till I returned; nor did I tell them to cook the fowls, and I would come and dine with them.

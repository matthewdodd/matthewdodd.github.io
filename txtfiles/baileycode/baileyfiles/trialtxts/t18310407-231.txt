. The prisoner is quite a stranger to me. On the 21st of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I missed these spoons off the sideboard in the coffee-room - there were eleven on the sideboard, but only six were taken; they were in the waiter's charge - I had not seen the prisoner in the house.

            . I am a refiner of gold and silver, and live in Long-acre. On the 23rd of March the prisoner offered these spoons for sale, cut into pieces; I suspected he had not come honestly by them, and detained him; he said they were given him by a friend to dispose of - I sent for a Policeman, and gave him in charge.

            . I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge, with the property.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming over the water, and met a friend in the Blackfriars-road; I went home with her, and after waiting some time, (I was tipsy) I received them from her - she put into my hand a paper; I did not knowwhat it was till morning; when I found what I had got, I thought they were of no use, and she intended them for sale; I know nothing of the robbery.

            . I live in Swan-street, Bethnal-green


; I lost four live cocks, and five live hens, on the 16th of last month. I was informed a person was taken with my sowls; I went as directed to the house of one Brebrook, there were my fowls hanging up dead; I was directed to the thief in New Prison; I went there and saw the prisoner; he told me a young man that knew my place, led him there; that he opened the gate with a knife, or a bit of iron, and went in, and took the fowls off the roost; that the other man killed them, and he himself put them in a sack; I swore to the fowls.

            . The prisoner and another man brought some fowls into my apartment; I do not know how many; the other man said he got them about seven miles off.

            . I went into the house where this last evidence lives; I saw some hens and a cock lying there; Mr. Brebrook came and took the prisoner in custody.
Prisoner's defence.
The young fellow lay two or three nights alongside of me; he had left his work and lodgings; he said there were some fowls where he had used to work, which his mother would not let him take away, and he was resolved to go by night, and fetch them, so I went along with him; I thought they were his own.

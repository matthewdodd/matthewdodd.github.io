             sworn.
I live in the Strand, keep I a sale-shop; the prisoner came to my house about five weeks ago with a silver handle of a knife for sale, I asked him how he came by it, he said it was his own property, an old family knife, it was of no service to him, and he had broke it up for the sake of the silver; he made a creditable appearance, and I purchased it of him, and he came again two or three days following, with another handle, either knife or fork; he came without his hat, and a plate in his hand, which convinced me he lived in the neighbourhood, to look at some things we had for sale; when I found his residence, then I sent to Mr. Cox, and in the evening I called at Mr. Cox's, and asked the prisoner if he knew me, he answered no; I then produced these handles, and asked if he knew them, he denied having any knowledge of them; the box was sent for in the room where he was, and it was opened by himself, and there were some empty bottles, and a spoon, and two other knife handles, and some other things of inferior value, which I do not recollect; he immediately begged Mr. Cox's pardon, and said he had the spoon to take physic with; upon which Mr. Cox sent for a constable, and sent him to the Compter; he gave no reason for the knife handle.
Produce the knife handle that you had from the prisoner? - I cannot tell which it is, I cannot positively swear to them, they being cut up.
Mr. Cox. When Mr. Essex came to my house we sent for the prisoner, and Mr. Essex accused him with these things, which he denied afterwards; I sent for the box, and he had the key of it; he opened it, and there was in it a spoon, engraved with Mr. Cole's name, Mitre Tavern, which is my property, I succeeded Mr. Cole; and there were the handles of two knives silver, and some bottles, they were my knife handles; he seemed to deny it, but I asked him what he did with the third knife handle that he offered to sell to Mr. Essex, he said, one of them was his; there were butter and cheese, and candles, and bottles, and several things.
(The spoon and the knife-handle deposed to.)
Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You say the name Cole is on the spoon? - Yes.
The Mitre tavern is a very old tavern I believe? - Yes.
I believe it is the custom of that house to serve all in plate? - Yes.
A great many of these spoons have been sold or lost at times? - Yes, some, but not lately.
You do not know the knife handles from any thing but their resembling the others? - No.
To Essex. You deal in old silver as well as other articles? - Yes.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Sir, I had the spoon up to take physic, there was physi c in my box, I had the spoon three days in the house, the box lay on one side where I used to clean the knives and they dropped in.
How came you to carry them to Mr. Essex to sell? - No, I do not acknowledge that.
Mr. Peatt to Cox. The key was in his box? - He lays in the room below stairs by the door, there is never a lock to it.

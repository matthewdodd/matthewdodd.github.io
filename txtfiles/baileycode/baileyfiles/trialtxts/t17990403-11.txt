             sworn. - I am a tallowchandler
, the corner of Spital-square


. On the 9th of March I lost a mould frame full of candles; we were making mould candles; I stood in the shop; I was using the frame about two minutes before I missed it; I went behind the counter to serve a customer; I heard a rustling; I went-out and caught it upon the prisoner within a few yards of the door; it was between eight and nine in the evening, (the frame produced); this is my frame; just as I caught hold of him, the candles sell out in the street.
Prisoner. I was senseless in liquor.
Limbery. He appeared to be in liquor.
- JARVIS sworn. - On Saturday, between eight and nine o'clock, Limbery sent for me to come to his house; I went, and found the prisoner there; he staggered about, seemingly as I thought to make sham drunk; I took him to the watch-house; the candles were then lying in the street, all over dirt, and the frame was in the shop; I marked the candles and the frame; when he got to the watch-house, he appeared to be sober.
Prisoner's defence. I had been drinking all day, and coming along I fell down several times in the mud; before I got home, I was taken in custody; I did not know what charge was laid against me.

THOMAS WELCH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



Thomas Fowlis, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS FOWLIS
. I live in Guildford-street, Russell-square. On the 30th of September I was on Holborn-hill, and felt a twitch at my pocket—I looked round, and saw the prisoner turn up Hatton-garden—I followed, and charged him with stealing my handkerchief, which I missed—he denied It—my son-in-law collared him, and said he would not let him go till he gave it up—he produced it from under his jacket.





WILLIAM HENRY PARKS
. I live in Guildford-street. I was with the prosecutor—I collared the prisoner—I said I was determined not to let him go till it was proved that he had not got—the handkerchief—he then gave it up—he had before denied that he had it—he resisted, and dragged me down Holborn-hill.

Prisoner. Was it not all over mud, and did I not say I had picked it up? Witness. There was no mud on it.

Prisoners Defence. I saw two decent young men before me; I saw the handkerchief on the ground; I took it up, and put it into my pocket; I went up Hatton-garden; these two gentlemen came, and said I had got the handkerchief; I did not deny it; I gave it up.





JOSEPH GIBBS
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

                  EDWARD
                   BULLOCK
               



             sworn.
I live in Tabernacle row, in St. Loke's parish


; I have an independence of my own; I missed my property, some part of it, about the 18th of September, that day I missed a white counterpane, or a bed quilt, and a set of blue and white furniture for a tent bedstead. On the 19th. I think it was I missed some other property, I missed a watch, a tortoiseshell case one, with a metal inside case; a pair of buckles, silver; two silver tea spoons; I afterwards missed some miniature pictures, the number I cannot ascertain, I believe three or four.
Q. Where did you miss all these things from? - Out of my dwelling house.


                  Q. 
               


            Had you had an opportunity of seeing them lately before? - I had an opportunity of seeing the watch, buckles, and spoons; I see them the 19th, that very day I missed them.
Q. Have you ever found any of your property again? - Yes, I have. After I had missed my first property, on looking over my drawers I found a sheet, which I thought was not my property at all, because it was so much worn, I called on a neighbour Mrs. Meredith, who keeps a linen draper's shop, and desired her to compare this with my linen; afterwards I went up to the two pair of stairs room to put by some linen, and while I went there I heard the street door open, on hearing the street door open I came down to see who was in the house; when I came down I saw my neighbour, Mrs. Meredith, in the parlour; she came to tell me that somebody was come to the house; I then looked down the stairs, and saw one of the prisoners, 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Buller
               



            , coming up the kitchen stairs; and on her observing me, she again turned herself round, and was going out again; she had been my servant

 near a year and three quarters before, and then her sister, 
               
                  Alice
                   Buller
               



            , came and staid with me from that time to the present.
Q. Was she a servant of your's? - She had been, but she was not then.
Q. How long had she lived with you? - Near a year and three quarters. This was Alice Buller; on the sight of me she returned down the stairs again, and I called to her, and asked her what she wanted there? She told me that she wanted to speak to her sister; I answered her and said, that her sister had left my service two days before, and she had told her; I told her that she had got a place; she said she had got no place yet.
Q. How long had her sister left your place? - But two days. I asked her where she was? She said, she should see her that evening; I told her to tell her I wanted to speak to her; she said she would tell her. She went away; and when she was gone, I went down in my kitchen, as I usually sit there, having no servant; in about half an hour I was preparing myself to go out.
Q. What time might this be? - It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. On my preparing to go out, I had hung a watch on a little brass hook on the chimney mantle piece, in the kitchen; I look ed and saw my watch was gone; a little while after that, it might be about ten or fifteen minutes, I went to put onmy shoes (I had had nobody in the house the whole day, only a gentleman that lodges with me, and he was out the whole day) I went to look for my buckles, and they were gone; looking round I missed a couple of spoons; I communicated this to a friend, who advised me to apply to a magistrate. There was nothing found on them.
Q. How soon after were they apprehended after you had missed the things? - They were apprehended, I believe a very little while afterwards; that day was the 19th that I missed these things.
Q. Were they apprehended that day? - No, not that day, a few days after that.

                   Buller
               



            's lodgings the same evening, I think it was Tuesday I heard of it, and I went the same evening, when I came there she was not at home; I asked the person that she lodged with whether she knew where Elizabeth Buller was? she said that she was gone to get a couple of pictures framed for her master; I found her the next day at Rotherhithe, and this chair cover I took out of her room in Old-street; the woman told me that was in the room, that they belonged to

Q. In the first place did you know this room to be her's? - Not her's; she lodged with this woman eight or ten days.
Q. Had you ever seen her there? - O, yes! I have seen her there or else I should not have known the girls.
Prosecutor. I have not the least doubt but what these chair covers are mine; I have three of the very same in my pocket.

BENJAMIN HOSEMAN. I live two or three hundred yards from Mr. Stead. On the 20th of January a person ran through my passage, and some soap was dropped, which I took up - I went to look after the person, and found the prisoner, who had got over two sheds into another garden - he was coming out of the privy.

 - I deal in soap
. On the 20th of January I lost two cakes of soap; I found one of them in Hoseman's passage - I saw the prisoner in the passage; he was accused of stealing the soap - he directly made his escape backwards; there were two other boys with him when I pursued him - they got away; this was between twelve and one o'clock in the day - it was taken from a box standing in the shop.

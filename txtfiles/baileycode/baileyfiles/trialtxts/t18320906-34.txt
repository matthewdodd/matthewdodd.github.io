             lives in South Molton-street


; he is a carpenter, and keeps a chandler's shop
. On the 20th of July I was in the parlour adjoining the shop - I had a glimpse of a person in the shop; I went out, and overtook the prisoner in the middle of the street, with this bundle of paper in his hand, which had been on the counter - I asked him for it, and he would not give it me; I took hold of him; he struck me, and ran away; the Policeman took him - he dropped the bundle; it is my father's paper - I had seen it in the shop before.

             (Police-constable C 88). I saw the prisoner and the witness scuffling, at about twenty minutes past nine o'clock; I went up and saw the bundle; the prisoner struck the witness - he ran off; I pursued and took him - I am sure he is the person; I took him to the shop, and got this paper from Mr. Brown.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Oxford-street; I heard an alarm, and ran in to Bond-street, where I was stopped; the boy said I had taken the paper; I was on an errand, and had been playing in the park.

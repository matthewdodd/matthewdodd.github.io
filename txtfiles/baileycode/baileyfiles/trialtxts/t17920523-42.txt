             sworn.
I am sixteen years old. I am the son of the prosecutor. I was in a little parlour adjoining to the bar on the 20th of April; I heard the rattling of money; I went into the bar, and I saw the prisoner standing before the till; he was trying to shove in the till, but it was stiff, and would not go in; it was not locked when I had left it last, but it was shut close to; the prisoner told me he went in for a glass of pepper-mint; I told him to take it; the drawer where the money was was half open and half shut; I examined the drawer, and found the gold and silver were taken out of it; I do not know what money was in it before; I know there were above twenty-three shillings in it in shillings, and a great quantity of sixpences; there is always gold and silver mixed together; he left three sixpences and one shilling: I had not been out of the bar five minutes when I heard the money rattle; I saw him push the till drawer; I called Daly, and told him that John had taken all the money out of the drawer.
Prisoner. Before the justice did not you swear there was not any gold kept in the bar? - I did not. The prisoner was our waiter.

             sworn.
I was in a room adjoining the bar; this lad told me that the waiter robbed the till; I detained the prisoner, till they sent to the Governor of the Tower; the house is in Tower; I kept him till the serjeant of the guard came.

I was sent for from the watch-house to the guard-room in the Tower; I searched the prisoner, and found six half-guineas and a guinea, in his fob; in his coat-pocket, four shillings and six-pence in halfpence, and one pound eighteen shillings in silver.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I used to draw beer for the prosecutor; I served him faithfully five months and a half; the money that I had I worked hard for.

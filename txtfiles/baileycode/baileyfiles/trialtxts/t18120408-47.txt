            . I am a carrier


 from sundry places in the north, in the York and Wakefield waggon.
Q. Are you the only proprietor of that waggon - A. No; there are 
               
                  John 
                  Harrison

                  John 
                  Beal
               



            . 
               
                  John 
                  Butler
               



             was the waggoner, he had the care of the waggon.


                  JOHN 
                  BUTLER
               



            . Q.Had you the charge of the Wakefield waggon - A. Yes; the waggon unloads at the White Horse Cripplegate; I unloaded it that morning, on the 26th of February, at seven o'clock; there was no parcel missing by the way bill from the waggon. About half past twelve o'clock I sent a parcel in our cart; the parcel was woollen cloth in a canvas wrapper; that was part of the contents of the said waggon.
Q. Who was the person that had the care of it - A. 
               
                  John 
                  Cox
               



            . 
               
                  John 
                  Cox
               



             left the yard with the cart, with another person to guard it; I saw the wrapper again at the Mansion House the next day; the prisoner was then in custody.
JOHN COX. Q. Did you take care of the cart which was to convey parcels that came by the Wakefield waggon - A. Yes, I did.
Q. Did you take every thing that you received safe out of the yard - A. I did. I was going down London Wall, and the wind blew very hard; I found it blew the covering off. I covered them over safe, and this said truss was safe in the cart at the time.
Q. What time of the day was this - A. As near a quarter before one as I can possibly guess.
Q. How much further did you go before you had reason to think you had lost any thing - A. I went as far as Broad-street, and as soon as I stopped the cart I missed it in a moment; I had occasion to stop the cart there; we had some goods to deliver in Broad-street, I missed the truss in a moment.
Q. In that distance could it have dropped out of your cart by accident - A. I am sure it was impossible it should shake out. I was driving the horse along, walking by the side of the horse.
Q. How could any person have got that truss out of your cart - A. There were a number of coal waggons passing at the time, and I was obliged to keep at the horse's head, going by the narrow part of London Wall by the church wall.
Q. Could any person have took it from behind - A. That must have been the way, it could not have fell out; it could not have gone out any other way than some person taking it out.
Q. Did you observe any person following of the cart - A. My attention was to the horse at that moment.
Q. Therefore you did not see any person about the cart - A. Not at the moment I did not; I did not miss it until I came to Broad-street. On the next day I saw the truss at the Mansion House.


                  GEORGE 
                  ROBERTS
               



            . I am a woollen cloth manufacturer.
Q. Was this package that was sent up by the Wakefield waggon your property - A. Yes; I delivered it to Deacon's waggon at Huddersfield; the parcel was directed to Mr. John Blackburn, Duke-street, Aldgate; the canvas wrapper contained two pieces of woollen cloth, a green and a blue forty-five yards and a half; the two pieces value thirty-three pounds eighteen shillings and seven pence, that is the charge to Mr. Blackburn.

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 26th of February I went into Broad-street about one o'clock; I saw the prisoner with this truss upon his shoulder; he was going towards Throgmorton-street. In Throgmorton-street I laid hold of him I asked him what he had got there; I received no answer; I saw the truss was falling from him to me, and I threw it off his shoulder backwards; I kept hold of the prisoner and secured him, after I had secured the prisoner he said he wished I had secured the man that passed me; he was the man that asked him to carry it. I had observed that man walking on the other side of the way before he passed me.
Q. Did he say that before the man was clean off - A. No, he did not. I took the prisoner to the Compter, on opening this bale at the Mansion House I found this invoice; I found it was consigned to Mr. Blackburn; I went to Mr. Blackburn, and he directed me to Mr. Deacon; I have kept it ever since, it contains a piece of blue cloth, and a piece of green.
Q. to Mr. Roberts. Look at that bill of parcels you sent with the wrapper and its contents - A. Yes, and the wrapper, and its contents belong to me; the contents are the same I sent up.
Q. to Mr. Deacon. Do you live in town - A. I do; I saw it was taken out of the waggon into the cart; I am the only person that has the carting business.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

                  DEANE
               



            . Q. On the day this man was taken in custody did you see any thing of him - A. I saw him at the corner of Winchester-street, opposite the posts; he was standing in the street; a gentleman asked him if he was a porter; he said, yes.
Q. Had he a knot - A. No, he had not; the gentleman asked him if he would carry that parcel a little way in the city for him; he said he would, and I parted with him; I saw no more of him.
Q. Was the parcel that the gentleman wanted him carry like that - A. I cannot say exactly it was like that, but I took no particular notice, nor which way he went.
COURT. Where was the parcel laying - A. Upon the posts facing of Winchester-street; I went towards Fore-street, I left them together; I went on my business; I am a taylor, I live at No. 72, Golden-lane; I live in the one pair, I do not rent the whole house.
Q. Who does rent the whole house - A. The landlord does not live in the house, he lives in Smithfield: he is a cutler, his name is Dennis; he has a workshop in Golden-lane, and his shop is in Smithfield.
Q. It is an odd thing for a gentleman to have such a large parcel, did it not strike you. How long have you known the prisoner - A. I have worked for him a twelve month back, and more than that latterly; he lived at No. 80, Grub-street, just above the chapel.
Q. What sort of a gentleman was this - A. It was a gentleman, he had a brownish coloured great coat on, or an olive colour.
Q. Are you quite sure that you were not in Throgmorton-street that day - A. I was not to my knowledge.
Q. Why you can best know whether you were or not - A. I certainly was not that day, nor week.
Q. When did you learn that this man was taken up - A. Why I heard from his friends that he had met with an accident.
Q. What do you mean by an accident - A. That he had got into trouble; they said, did you see James so-and-so, I said yes.
Q. What day was it you saw him - A. The 26th of February; I believe it was Wednesday.
Q. When were you told of it - A. I heard of it on the Sunday morning. It was Wednesday that I met with him to the best of my knowledge.
Q. What time of the day was it. A. It was past eleven o'clock; it might be half an hour, but I am quite sure it was not twelve.
Q. Look at the truss was it as large as that - A. I cannot say; I did not take particular notice.
Q. to Butler. What time of day was it the cart left your premises - A. Within ten minutes; I cannot speak truly about half an hour after twelve.
Q. to Cox. What time did you leave the inn-yard - A. I am quite sure I was in the inn-yard at twelve o'clock.
Q. How long do you think you had left before you missed this truss - A. I do not think it was more than about twenty minutes.
Mr. Adolphus. Will you undertake to say that very truss was the truss that was in the cart - A. Yes: I know it by the direction, there was only this one truss to Mr. Blackburn.

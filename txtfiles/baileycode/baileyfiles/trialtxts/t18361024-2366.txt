ALLAN CAMERON
 (police-constable N 91.) I saw the prisoner, between tow and three o'clock in the morning of the 6th of October, crossing the City-road, in the direction of the Eagle, with something—I ran and stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, some brushes which he had brought from Hull; that he had arrived late by the steam-boat, and had stopped to take refreshment—I found on him forty-seven brushes, four pairs of shears, two razors, and a strop—he was about half a mile from the prosecutor's.





JAMES BADCOCK
. I am a brush-maker. These are my property—I lost them from my shop on the 6th of October, between eight o'clock at night and seven o'clock the next morning—when I entered, I found some person had been there—the shop had not been locked—it is in a yard, surrounded by a well twenty feet high—I go in by the gates, which were locked fast—the person who got in scaled the wall, by means of a house on the other side—I was acquainted with the prisoner and his friends—he had frequently been at my house—I had missed these things before I saw the officer.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am an officer of Tower Ward. On the 14th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me with a loaf of sugar. I asked him where he got it? he said in the Borough. I said I would take him there; he then said he did not know where he got it, and if I would let him go I might have it.

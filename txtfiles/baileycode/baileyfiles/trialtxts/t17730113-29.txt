            . I keep a chandler's shop
. Upon the 13th of December last, about nine at night, I heard the bell of my shop door; I went into the shop and missed this sugar; I followed the prisoner, seized him, and charged him with the fact; he denied it; I brought him into the house and then he confessed it, and said if I would go over the way with him, he would let me know where the sugar was; he had been three times at my house, and had changed his dress, which made me suspect him.
- Lyons. I am a constable; I took the prisoner to a public house; there he confessed he had taken the sugar and would shew us where it was.

            . The prisoner came to our house three times; first in a striped jacket; then he changed his dress; the third time there was an alarm by the bell; he was followed and brought in by my husband, and he confessed he took it; the confession was first made in the house.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of it; I did not know what I did when I confessed; they threatened to put me into irons.

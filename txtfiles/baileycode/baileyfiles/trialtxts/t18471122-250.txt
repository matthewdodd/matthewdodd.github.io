ELIZABETH FORD.
 I am the wife of John Ford, a cabinet-maker, of Brook-street, Lambeth. On the evening of the 1st Nov., I was in Kenningtes-lane, about ten minutes before eight o'clock—the prisoner spoke to me—I had seen him in the street before, and knew him well by sight—he got into talk with me about the weather—I went and had a glase of ale with him is Mansion-house-street, at a little beer-shop—while there I took out my watch to look what time it was—it wanted ten minutes to eight o'clock—the prisoner was present and the gentleman behind the bar—I came out of the door—the prisoner followed me—I bid him good night, and said, "Thank you"—I went straight down Mansion-house-street—when I got half-way down, I looked behind, and saw him following me—I kept on till I got to the end of the street—I turned, and saw him again—I turned to the left, to go down Kennington-row—I still saw him following me—I saw a turning with a pawnbroker's at the corner—I knew it brought me out opposite the school, and turned down there—the commencement of it is rather dark—I did not see the prisoner there, but as soon as I got round the corner he flew on me, and caught hold of me—I have not any doubt it was the prisoner—he threw me down, and he got my cloak open, and pulled the watch out of my bosom by the guard, and my purse with 19s. 6d. in it, and kicked me in the side—he did not break the guard, but wrenched the watch from it—when I was on the ground I saw him with my watch in his hand—he was gone almost instantly—while he was getting it, I was scrambling to get from him, but I was so confused that I could neither halloo nor speak.

Cross-examined by
MR. MELLER.
Q. What is your name? A. I suppose it is Elizabeth Williams—my husband's name is Thomas Williams—he left me three years ago, last June, and since then I have been living with Mr. Ford, about fifteen months—I do nothing for my living, Mr. Ford keeps me—I never was on the town—I first saw the prisoner on that night in Kennington-lane—I have seen him about the street before—I have seen him about Newington, leaning on a post—I know nothing further of him—I am not in the habit of going to drink with any person that ask me, but I was thirsty—we had a pint of ale, nothing else—I had had some gin where I had been to tea in the afternoon—we had 6d. worth between four of us—that was where I changed a sovereign—it was about five o'clock—I had not had anything between that and the time I met the prisoner—a young man came into the beer-shop when the prisoner, and I, and the person who keeps the beer-shop were there—it could not be half an hour after I left the beer-shop before I was robbed—there are houses on either side of the street—I did not see any policeman there—I had a very great objection to the prisoner following me—I did not know what he wanted—I thought he was taking undue liberty—I should not allow it—I was not in the Spread Eagle, in White-hart-street, that night—I have not been in that house since the present landlord kept it—I was not at the King's Arms, in Chester-street—I was not in any public-house—when I came from where I went to tea, I came on till I saw the prisoner—I do not know Owen, who keeps a brothel—I did not ask the prisoner to go to a brothel with me—I will swear there was never such a thing said or thought of—there

was not the least expression of it on his part or mine—I did not say anything about paying a shilling for the room—I did not say I knew a place that would do instead of a room—nothing of the kind was mentioned—on my oath, I had not been with the prisoner that night—I did not go into a court with him—if he said that he had connexion with me it was not true—I had no wrangle with him about money—I was robbed once before. when the house was robbed, a year and eight months ago—I was not intoxicated that evening—I had been to tea at Vauxhall, and was going home to 70, Brook-street—I was not going the nearest way—I wanted to take something home with me—I left the prisoner at the door of the house, and had no more conversation with him—a young man came into the public-house—he asked him for two farthings for a halfpenny, and he gave them to him—there were no persons passing where the prisoner robbed me—it was by the side of the pawnbroker's just against the wall—I wanted to avoid him, and I took a turning that would have taken me to kennington-lane—I saw him by the shop as far from me as the width of this Court—I did not notice whether I passed many persons in going from the public-house—I was knocked down in the mud on my left side—a woman was going into the pawnbroker's or standing by the front door, and I was by the side door, a little further down than the door—I was so frightened, I could not halloo—I screamed out after I got up when my fright was over—I do not know whether the woman was by the door then—I did not see her afterwards; I did go that way when I got up, I went to Kennington-lane, and turned to my right—I should think it is about a quarter of a mile from the station—I went to the station instantly—I did not abuse the prisoner because he did not give me money—I never spoke to him after I bid him good night.

MR. METCALF.
Q. When the attack was first made, and this kick given, you were too frightened to cry out? A. Yes, but I got up and went to the station—I go by the name of Ford—I never answer to the name of Williams—the watch was my own, and the money Mr. Ford had given me.





GRORGE HARRIS.
 I keep a beer-shop, in Mansion-house-street. On the 1st Nov., Mrs. Ford and prisoner came into my beer-shop a few minutes after eight o'clock in the evening—Mrs. Ford called for a pint of the best ale—the prisoner said, "No, I take 6d. ale"—he called for a ping—they stood and drank it—they did not stop in the bar above ten minutes—I saw Mrs. Ford take a watch from her bosom and look at the time.

Cross-examined. Q. Did they speak? A. They said very little—the prisoner was talking to another young man part of the time—the prisoner paid for what they drank, and he and Mrs. Ford left together from the bar—I cannot say which went out first—Mrs. Ford appeared to have been drinking a little but to know perfectly what she was about—I thought so by her manner, not by her conversation—she said but very little in my presence.





JOSEPH RACKSTRAW
 (policeman, L 120.) I took the prisoner—I told him he was wanted for a highway robbery, and he was the beat judge whether he knew anything about it—he said he did not know—in going to the station he asked me whether it was a woman who preferred the charge—I said I did not know.

Cross-examined. Q. He went readily with you to the station? A. Yes; it was on Wednesday—I took him two days after the robbery—there was nothing found on him—this is the guard belonging to the watch, and the handle of the watch—it was left on Mrs. Ford's neck.





CRARLES BURGESS GOFE
 (police-sergeant, L 8.) I produce a certificate of

the prisoner's former conviction at Newington—(read—Convicted, Oct., 1837, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the man—I knew him before then, and I have known him since.




GUILTY.† Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years.

FRANCIS SAMUEL CARLE
. I am a carver and gilder, of Newington. On 11th Jan., about a quarter-past three o'clock in the afternoon, a constable came to

me with the prisoner, and asked me whether he had purchased anything of me—I said, "No"—he then produced this painting, which I identified—I had seen it safe about an hour before.





GEORGE WADEY
 (policeman, P 335). The prisoner was pointed out to me in the street, carrying this picture—I asked him what he had got—he said a picture he had bought in the Walworth-road—I asked him to show me the shop, and he did—I asked Mr. Carle if he had sold it him—he said he had not.





EDWARD CLARK
 (policeman, P 152). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted May, 1848, confined three months, and whipped)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

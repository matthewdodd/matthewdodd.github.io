JOSEPH HEADINGTON
. I am an officer. On 14th April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in King William-street—I saw the prisoners together, following two gentlemen—Ryan had a sack round his shoulders, and I saw something red between the sack and his body—I stopped him, asked him what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I lifted up the sack,

and found this handkerchief—when I stopped him Grant walked sharply away—I searched Grant at the station, and found these other two handkerchiefs in the flap of his trowsers.





JOSEPH HUGGETT
 (City-policeman, 23). I was with Headington—I saw the two prisoners together, and saw the ends of this handkerchief between Ryan's body and the sack he had over his shoulders—the gentlemen were not more than a yard from the prisoners at that time.





JOHN THOMAS GRIFFITH
. This is my handkerchief—I had it in my pocket on the afternoon of 14th April—the officer spoke to me, and I missed it—Headington had it in his hand.





EDWARD FUNNELL
. I am an officer. I know the prisoners—I have seen them together—I did not see them that day—I saw them about a fortnight before.

GRANT**—


GUILTY
. Aged 21.—

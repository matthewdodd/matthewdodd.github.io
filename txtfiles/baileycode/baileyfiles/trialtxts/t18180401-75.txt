            . I am carman
 to Messrs. Hodges - I drove the waggon into Compton-street


, about six o'clock in the evening, and saw two men walking backward and forward by it - I suspected them. Soon after that, a person struck my fore-horse-the horse ran across the street; I put it right, returned to the tail of the waggon and missed the can-the prisoner was one of the men that were lurking about the waggon.

            . On the 21st of February I was in Compton-street, and saw the prisoner lurking about the waggon. Suspecting him, I watched and saw him take the can out - I followed, overtook, and asked him what was under his apron? he said he did not know, for he picked it up. I took it from him in Queen-street.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.

LEWIS GILSON, JUN. I am a notary-public

, and live in Thames-street. On the 17th of April I was on Ludgate-hill


 - I felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket; I turned and saw the prisoner drawing it from his trousers, and handing it to a boy - I could see it was a handkerchief, and it answered to the appearance of mine.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you not a lady with you? A. Yes; I turned the instant I felt the tug - I cannot tell how the prisoner could put my handkerchief into his trousers, but he was pulling it out from the bottom of them; it might be another handkerchief, but I believe it was mine - there was another boy there, who went off quickly when he received the handkerchief from the prisoner - I detained the prisoner, and gave him in charge.
CHARLES EVANS. I am a patrol of Farringdon within. I received the prisoner at the corner of Creed-lane, on this charge.
Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief which he saw in my hand was my own, and the officer gave it back to me, as the gentleman said it was not his.
CHARLES EVANS. I found one handkerchief on the prisoner, which the prosecutor did not claim, but the prisoner did not say this then.

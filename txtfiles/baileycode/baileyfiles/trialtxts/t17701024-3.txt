                   Clements
               



            . I have lodgings at Mrs. Hemmings's, who is a watchmaker, and lives at the corner of Air-street, Piccadilly


. There is a room in my apartments that looks into Piccadilly, and two other back rooms that look into Air-street. I was in the back room till eight o'clock at night on the 14th of July, when I went into the fore room, where I staid some time. I locked the door of the back rooms when I went out about nine o'clock; I walked in the park for some time, and then went to the 
               
                  Gun
                   Tavern
               



            , where I supped and staid till about eleven o'clock. My landlord let me in when I came home; I went up stairs, and when I put the key into the lock I found it would not turn; upon trying the latch I found the door was unlocked. I am certain I locked it when I went out. As soon as I opened the door I observed that the inside shutters to one of the windows were opened, which I am sure was shut when I went out; this made me suspect somebody had been in my room. When I went a little farther into the room I trod upon some cloaths; this frightened me, and I ran down stairs to Mr. Hemmings for help. We got a candle and went up stairs; I found the lid of my trunk open, out of which were stolen four waistcoats, two pair of sheets, two scarlet cloth waistcoats, a silk waistcoat, mazarine blue, trimmed with silver, a sattin waistcoat with the lace taken off from the flap of the pocket, a linen waistcoat and a pair of leather breeches. I found a drawer open in my chest of drawers, out of which were taken eleven shirts and a pair of sheets; from the chimney-piece was taken a metal watch and a stand in which it stood; from my bed-room, which was an inner room that went out of this, I missed two gold watches that hung by the side of the window, and a hanger that hung near the watches. Henley is a shoemaker; he had been in my room, and seen me open my trunk; he made my shoes; I knew nothing of Conroy. I applied to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ; I had hand-bills printed, and advertized it in the papers, but I had no intelligence of the robbery till about eight days afterwards, when I went to enquire for Henley, to get some spur leathers of him, when I was told Henley was in the Poultry Compter; still I did not suspect him. But in the evening of the same day I saw one Garridge, a Jew; he told me that he believed my things were found. I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; there I saw the two prisoners; when I saw Henley I asked him how he did; he said he came there upon my affair. I said are you the man that robbed me? He said no; but, pointing to Conroy, he said this is the man I had the watch of. From the prisoner's information I went to several pawnbrokers, where I found different parts of my goods.

            . Mr. Clements went out between eight and nine the evening he was robbed, I can swear that these watches are Mr. Clements's property.

            . On Sunday the 22d of July in the afternoon, as I was standing at my door in Duke's Place, the two prisoners came up to me and asked me if I knew one Solomans, a Jew; I told him there were a great many of that name. They proposed to go to an alehouse to drink, which I did. Henley asked me if I would buy a gold watch. I told him I should like to see it, and made as if I would buy it. They said they had not the watch with them, but they would bring it at nine o'clock to me at the Mitre in Duke's Place; they came accordingly at nine o'clock. We went from there to the Blue Boar, in Camomile-street; we went into a private room, and there Henley pulled out the plain gold watch, and offered it me for 7 l. I bid him six guineas for it. (I had no intention to buy them because I suspected they had stolen them ) they said they would take six guineas; then Conroy pulled the other watch out of his pocket, and offered it for sale; he asked me six guineas for it. I asked them how they came by them; they said they did not expect I should have asked them such a question. They said they had some laced cloaths at home to dispose of. I told them I had not money about me to pay for the watches, but I would go home and fetch the money. I went to one Pagett, a constable, for assistance; Pagett staid at the door while I went into the house. I asked them to let me look at the watches again; Henly gave me one of them; I said I would stop them and the watches. Paget came in and took the watch from Conroy.

                   Pagett
               



            . Garridge came to me, and told me he suspected the two prisoners, and asked me to go with him to the house where they were, in Camomile-street; I went with him. When I went into the room, Garridge said there are your prisoners; upon that they started out of their chairs. I searched Henly, and took the plain gold watch out of his pocket; it was without the outside case; Garridge had the outside case in his hand.
Q. to Garridge. I thought you said Pagett took the watch out of Henly's pocket.
Garridge. Yes.
Q. What, the watch complete with both the cases?
Garridge. Yes.
Q. to Paget. You hear Garridge says you took the whole of the watch from Henly?
Paget. He is mistaken in that; I went afterwards to the prisoner's lodgings, and there I found this watch stand (producing it) but there was no watch in it then. When they were before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             Conroy said if Sir John would admit him an evidence he would discover every thing; and he told Sir John where he had pawned several of the things. Conroy said Henly was innocent of any theft, that he only went with him to sell the watches, with which he was to pay Henley some money he owed him.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Snow-hill; I took in the mazarine blue waistcoat, laced with silver, of Conroy, on the 14th of July, about ten at night. He spoke to me in very broken English, and asked me to let him have two guineas upon it. I supposed him to be a foreigner; I had a good deal of difficulty to understand him. I offered him a guinea and a half; he would not take that; I lent him 34 s. I asked him his name, he told me something like Dyane. I asked him where he lived; with some difficulty I understood it to be somewhere near the Seven Dials.
Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the same man that brought you the waistcoat?
Bruin. I am certain he is the man.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Fleet-market; I took in the green and the black waistcoat of somebody, but at this distance of time I cannot tell who. (The goods produced in court and sworn to by the prosecutor.)
Conroy's Defence.
I bought these goods of one Rossinberg; I sold him a large parcel of shoes and boots. When I carried them home he had no money to pay me, but he said that he had got these goods; and if I would take them I should have them cheap. I said they did not lay in my way, but as he had not got cash I would take them. I agreed with him for 31 l. my bill came to 25 l.
Henly's Defence.
Conroy owed me 3 l. 12 s. 6 d. I asked him for the money, he said he would pay me at two or three different times. He came to my room on Sunday evening, and he brought a trunk, which he desired me to take care of as there was no lock to the garret door. He told me if I would go with him to Duke's Place to sell a watch he would pay me my money, I asked him how he came by it; he said he bought it of Rosenberg. I went with him to Duke's Place to sell it in order to get my money.

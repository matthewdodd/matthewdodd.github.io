. On Friday last, this great coat was in my surgery; I saw the prisoner leave my door with it under his arm - I followed, and overtook him within six yards - I saw him drop it; two other persons were about; I had had it five or six weeks - I think the lowest value of it is 3l. - I have lost three within the last year.

            . I am servant to Mr. Southee. I hung this coat in the surgery, not ten minutes before it was taken; I saw the prisoner go out with it; I went out, and saw him drop it.

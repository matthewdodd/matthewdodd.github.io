SAMUEL DUTTON. I live on Ludgate-hill


, and am a hatter
. I know nothing of the prisoner, but I lost these hats from my shop.
JOHN KIRKMAN (Police-constable F 107). I took the prisoner carrying these two hats in the Strand, on the 2nd of May; I asked how he got them; he said they belonged to him - I asked what was the initials on them; he declined to tell me; I took him a little way; he made a bolt, and ran; I took him again, and took him to the station - I found this model of a key upon him.
PETER GEORGE HASE. I am a shoemaker. I was going down Ludgate-hill - I saw the prisoner and a respectably dressed young man; I had seen them in bad company, and I followed them; when we were opposite to Rundell and Bridge's I missed the other; I waited a few minutes, and saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, and come out with these hats - I followed him to the Straud, and told the officer, who took him.

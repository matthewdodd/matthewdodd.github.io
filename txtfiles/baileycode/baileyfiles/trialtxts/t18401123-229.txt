THOMAS MILLAR
. was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of November, 5 weights, value 2s., the goods of 



Richard Barratt; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN BARRATT
. I am the wife of Richard Barratt; we keep a chandler's-shop, at Tanner's-hill, Deptford. The prisoner came there to buy 11b. weight of bread, about half-past four o'clock, on the 19th of November—he was there two or three minutes—I observed him shuffling about—when he had been gone half an hour I missed my weights—the officer brought them—these produced are them.





JOSEPH GREE
. (police-constable R 137.) I found the prisoner in New-row, Deptford, selling these weights in a rag-shop—I went in, and asked where he got them—he said his sister gave them to him—I took him to his mother's, and saw his sister—she said she knew nothing of them—I then found the prosecutrix.

Prisoner. I picked them up in a piece of paper; I then went to the rag-shop, to see if any one had owned them.





BENJAMIN LOVEL
. (police-sergeant R 15.) I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

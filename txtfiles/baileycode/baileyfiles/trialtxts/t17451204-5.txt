            , was indicted for

                           William 
                           Counsel

             for 


               receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen
            .


                  William 
                  Counsel 
               



            . I lost my Watch the 28th of August

, at or near Exeter-Exchange in the Strand



. I must confess that I was very much in Liquor. It was about Eight or Nine o'Clock at Night.
Q. How came you by it again?


                  William 
                  Counsel 
               



            . It was found upon the Eldest at the Bar: it was taken from her the 4th of November at her own House.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . The young Woman at the Bar ask'd me to go out with her that Night -
Q. What Night?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . I don't know.
Q. What Time of the Night?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . About Eight o'Clock. And we went into the Street, and we met this Gentleman at the End of Exeter-Street.
Q. What was you to go out with her for?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . We were to go a-whoring together.
Q. In what Manner was the Gentleman familiar with her?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . They were talking together, and the Gentleman took his Watch out of his Fob, and put it into his Coat-Pocket. I stood close by her, and there was Light in the Street by the Lamps, and I saw her put her Hand into his Coat-Pocket and take it out; after that he fell down by a Blow that she gave him, he being much in Liquor. She went to her Mother, and her Mother gave her 40 Shillings for the Watch.
Q. What Discourse was there between the old Woman, her and you?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . It was all about picking the Gentleman's Pocket. Sometime after this, it (the Watch) was read in the Advertiser, and there was a Guinea and a half Reward for them that would bring it.
Q. You say the Mother gave 40 Shillings for it?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . Not that Night, but the next Day.
Q. Who was by?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . None but the Mother, she and I.
Prosecutor. The Watch cost me four Guineas at second Hand. I have had it four Years.
Q. What do you think it worth? Can you pawn or sell the Watch, or such a Watch as this, for more?
Prosecutor. Indeed, I am no Judge of the Value of Watches.
- Barnes. The Night that the Prosecutor lost his Watch, he said he had been robb'd of his Watch and some Silver; and the Gentleman came the next Day to advertise his Watch: He said he would give a Guinea and a half; and then we heard no more of it 'till this young one was committed to the Gatehouse.
Prosecutor. She sent a Person to tell me, that there was a Person in the Gatehouse that could help me again to the Watch: she said, she was concern'd with a Man, and if you are the Man, you have lost something else besides your Watch. I told her that I had a Leaden shilling in my Pocket, that I took a Day or two before. Then she said, you are the Man that I robb'd. Accordingly she said that she would make an Information, and she did before Sir

                  De Veil 
               



            , and he gave a Search-Warrant to search the Mother of this Newberry: She is the Husband's Mother. Having the Warrant, we went into the Room, and he [

                  Rolton 
               



             ] search'd the old Woman's Pockets, and said I believe I have got it; And he said, Sir, is this your Watch; and I said, if it is open'd I can tell, because the Name is Stone, which Name somebody had endeavour'd to craze out: We took it away. The old Woman said it was her Son's Watch; and the Daughter said that she had fetch'd it out of Pawn, and that it was her Husband's Watch.
Prisoner Elizabeth. She said there was none but she and I when she made the Information. Ask her what the other Person's Name was?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . Pain.
Q. What Day advertis'd?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . The 30th of August.
Q. When stolen and bargain'd for?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . The 28th and paid for the 29th.

                  Bolton 
               



            . I had a Search-Warrant to search her House, and in the old Woman's Pocket I found it (the Watch) serv'd up in this little Bag.
Prisoner Elizabeth. My Lord I met this Evidence, and she said to me will you go and drink a Pint of Beer? and there was a Soldier with her, and we went to drink, and the Soldier pull'd out the Watch, and he said, Go and pawn this Watch; and they offer'd 15 s. for it: and I said, I know where to sell it for more Money. This Evidence has charg'd me with a Pair of Ear-rings: She wants to swear a Street-Robbery upon me.

Prisoner Susanna. I bought this Watch of the Evidence and this Woman: She said to me, Mother, will you buy my Husband's Watch? and I bought it, and borrow'd Part of the Money; and I pinn'd it up, and said, It shall not be seen 'till I see my Child's Face.
Jury. We desire to understand clearly the Time when advertis'd, to the Time when it was found in her Pocket.
A. Lost the 28th (August) bought the same Night, paid for the 29th and advertis'd the 30th, and found in her Pocket the 4th of November.
Q. Did you know that she sent for the Advertiser?
A. I heard it read the Day that it came out; it was the second Day after the Robbery; and in reading it she fell a-crying, and said that she had a good Mind to carry it (the Watch) to Mr. Counsel; and her Daughter said she might do what she would.

            . Mrs. Newberry came to me, and desir'd to borrow a little Money, for her Son had been extravagant, and his Watch lay in Pawn, and she was willing to have it, to remember him. Well I lent her what she desir'd: If it had been the whole 40 Shillings, she should have had it. I keep a Butcher's Shop, went to carry out Meat, and call'd in at her House. I saw the Watch, and she kiss'd it, and said it should be the last Thing that she would part with. I have trusted her with five or six Pounds at a Time.

            . I live in the same House. I came down for a little Water; I went into the Room, and the Woman was selling her the Watch.
Q. What Time?
Lewis. It was about Ten o'Clock in the Morning; and she said it was her Son's Watch, and she was willing to have something to remember him, if she never saw him any more.

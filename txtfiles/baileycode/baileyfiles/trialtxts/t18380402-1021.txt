JOHN DIXON
. I keep the Rose and Crown, King-street, Westminster. I was at Broad Sanctuary on the 17th of March, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock at noon—somebody gave me information—I missed my handkerchief, and saw the prisoner walking away, twisting it up—I said "Stop, I want you"—he ran off—a man ran and took him—he threw the witness, Facey, down against the railings—we pursued him again, and he tried to throw the handkerchief into the square, but the wind took it, and we picked it up—this is it—(looking at it.)





JAMES FACEY
. I saw the prisoner running, and I took hold of him—he threw me down—we pursued him again, and he threw down this handkerchief.

Prisoner. It was a temptation; the gentleman had the handkerchief hangin out of his pocket.





JOHN BOOTH
. I am a watchman. I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Gilby's office, at Westminster—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY

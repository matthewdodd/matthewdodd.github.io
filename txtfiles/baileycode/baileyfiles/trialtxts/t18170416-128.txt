            . I am an officer. I was on duty at the Docks. As the prisoner was going out, I stopped him, and told him he had got something that he should not - He said he had not - I found 9lbs. of leaf tobacco about his body, and 3lbs. in his hat - He is a custom-house officer
 - He desired me not to tell, as he should lose his place.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. We are not allowed to rub the custom-house officers down as they go out.

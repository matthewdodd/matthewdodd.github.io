            . I live with Mr. Paglar. This property was in the room I sleep in - the prisoner had been a cook, but was out of a situation and slept there with me; the property was safe when she came, and two days after she was gone I missed it - no one else could have taken it; all the property has been found - she gave up the duplicates.

            . I am one of the Gang-porters, belonging to Porter's-key


. On the 7th of this instant, I had word brought me there was a man in the buildings; I went, and took Mr. Dutton with me, he had a lanthorn; it was about 7 at night: we went in, and when we were above, we found the capsen rope was down, with which we load the goods; we concluded, the person must have gone down that, we knew they must then be safe, as they could not get out of the area. We went down, and found the prisoner there, in a vault, with the quantity of sugar mentioned, in his pocket. He said, he did not know how he came there; he thought it had been an alehouse: his apron was all daubed with sugar.

            . I was with this evidence, and found the prisoner, as he has mentioned.

Prisoner's Defence.
I had been at work by the water-side, to help to land some sugar. I took this sugar from the bottom of the lighter; it was full of dirt and tar: then I went to Billingsgate, to buy some fish, and they laid hold on me. (The sugar produced, and appeared clear from dirt or tar).

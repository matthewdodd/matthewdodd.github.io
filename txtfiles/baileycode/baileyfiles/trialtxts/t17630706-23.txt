Thomas Hall. I belong to the Hanover Packet. The prisoner worked three or four days on board, in the steerage where my hammock was, my buckles were in my waistcoat-pocket in my hammock, I missed them on the 28th of June, he was then on board; they were found again at Mr. Jerviso's.

            . I am a goldsmith at Wapping, Old Stairs; a person, very much like the prisoner, brought these buckles to me on the 28th of June, about 6 in the evening, he wanted to sell them, saying they were his own; I weighed them, and gave him 23 s. and 6 d. for them. I do believe the prisoner is the same person. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)

            . I live with Mr. Jervise. I was by at the time Mr. Jervise bought the buckles; I am certain the prisoner is the man that sold them; when he was taken I saw him, he had the same dress on as he had before, except a pair of long trowsers.

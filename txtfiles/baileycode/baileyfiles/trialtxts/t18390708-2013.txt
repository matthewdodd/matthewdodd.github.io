JAMES WATTS
. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, in Monmouth-street The prisoner was in my employ—he lodged and boarded with me—on Monday, the 17th of June, I sent him to Mr. Hunt's, in Monmouth-street, to get a pot of ale for supper, and to receive a bill of 17s. 6d.—he brought it back to have it receipted—I gave it to him again, and he never returned till the Friday following, when the policeman brought him—he had been about ten days in my employ—I had a reference with him, but had not time to go for his character.





HENRY HUNT
. I am a customer of Mr. Watts. On the 17th of June, the prisoner came for some ale, and produced the bill to me—I told him to go home and get it receipted and he should have the money—he returned with it receipted, and I gave him the money—I paid him in shillings and copper.





JOHN PIKE
 (police-constable F 105.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of June, at No. 30, Charles-street, Drury-lane—it is a very bad house—all manner of thieves live in it.

MARY MACAULIFFE
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of Sept., 1 gown, value 1l.; 6 knives, 1s.; 6 forks, 1s.; and 20 paintings and frames, the goods of 



Mary Ann Pitman, her mistress.






MARY ANN PITMAN
. I am a widow, and life at No. 60, Walcot-place, Lambeth. The prisoner was in my service for three weeks—she left on the 6th of Oct.—I missed a quantity of pictures from a closet in the kitchen after she was gone—the policeman brought them afterwards—the closet was opened one day for the carpenter to ease the door, while the prisoner was there—I locked it afterwards—I cannot swear to the knives and forks—I lost some, and these look like mine—this dress is my sister's, and was kept in a wardrobe in the room in which the prisoner slept.





WILLIAM HUMPHRIES
 (police-constable M 127.) I took the prisoner into custody on another charge—she was searched at the station, and eight duplicates were found on her, which led to the discovery of this gown at Mr. Wharton's, Mount-street, Lambeth, and some knives and forks, and the pictures at Mr. Dempster's, the pawnbroker's—he is not hero—he gave the property up before the Magistrate—I afterwards went to the different pawnbrokers with the duplicates, and got these articles—I have not got the counterparts of the duplicates here.





ANN STEPHENS
. I am the wife of Peter Stephens, a policeman—I am employed at the Southwark-bridge station-house to search females—I searched the prisoner, and found eight duplicates on her, and delivered them to the officer.
(Property produced and sworn to,)




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Ten Years.



Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

             sworn.
I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at the magistrates; on Saturday the 2d of February, a little before twelve at noon; we missed two furr muffs from the window of my son's house, his name is Dudley; I am there always by day, I never saw the prisoner, nor never see any body take them, but I missed them in a few minutes before, I had just turned out of the shop, and the muffs were stole; and when I came into the shop again, I missed them. The officer Sanders brought the muffs back.
- SANDERS sworn.
I was chose an extra man at Marlborough-street; I am an hardwareman. On Saturday the 12th of February, about twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner coming down Vine-street; I was standing at the bottom of Vine-street in Broad-street, it is a street that leads from Russell-street to Broad St. Giles's, he had a blue apron before him, I saw him with something lapped up in it very close against his body, I knew the boy before, and I suspected he had got something that he had no right to, I waited at the bottom of the street till he came to the bottom; I asked him what he had got, and I took hold of him, and brought him into the house where I lived, I searched him to see what he had got in his apron; he did not speak any thing plain that Icould well understand; I asked him if he had got a swag there, and I took and opened his apron, and found these two muffs; I don't think it was above a quarter of an hour according as I heard after they were lost; I took the boy and muffs up to Marlborough-street, where he was committed; I asked the boy where he got them, he said a man gave him sixpence, to carry them through St. Giles's for him, from the end of Oxford-road where I met him into Drury-lane, and to take them from him again; I found no sixpence about him, in searching him, as I supposed if any body had given him sixpence he must have had it; I went to a number of houses where they sold muffs, to enquire whether they had lost such things. On Monday morning I found Mr. Dudley had lost two, I went to Mr. Dudley and acquainted him that the prisoner was in custody, and he came up to the magistrates, and identified the muffs.
Court to Mrs. Hellear. Do you recollect exactly what time of the day it was you missed these muffs? - They were there at half after eleven, and I believe a quarter more; I had seen them a very few minutes before I missed them. (The muffs produced and deposed to.)
Court to Mrs. Hellear. Was there no strangers in the shop about the time these muffs were missed? - There was no one in the shop but our own family.
Q. Then you suppose that the muffs were taken by some person or other when nobody was in the shop? - They were.
Q. How came you to leave the shop? - There were several people in the parlour adjoining.
Q. Do you recollect seeing a boy, or such a boy as that about the shop that day? - Not that day, but I had the day before; and I saw some of his accomplices, I know the boy by sight, when I saw him at the justice's, I recollected him.
Q. Where did you see him before? - Near the house, but not that day as I know of.
Q. Who had you seen him with? - With another boy and girl.
Prisoner. I want to know whether you ever saw me before? - I don't know that ever I saw this boy before, till I saw him at the office.
Prisoner. I was coming down Oxford-road and a man came up to me and tapped me on the shoulders, says he, my boy will you carry these two muffs for me to St. Giles's, and he told me to go down Vine-street, and when I came down Vine street this man apprehended me; I thought the man was behind my heels, and directly I looked back the man was gone.



               GUILTY
            . (Aged 14.)
Court to Sanders. Do you know him? - We had him at Marlborough-street about a week before; I have known him loitering about for four or five weeks, with an apprentice girl, whom I have sent home to her own parish with a pass.

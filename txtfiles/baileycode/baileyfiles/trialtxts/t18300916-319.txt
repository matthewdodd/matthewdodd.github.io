, in the service of Mr. John Brickell. On the 1st of September the prisoner took a shirt from his shop, and walked away with it - it was very near the door; I went out after her; she hesitated, and said she would not have it - I told her to keep it in her own hands - I sent a young man who had been watching her some time for an officer.
Prisoner. I was not away from the spot where the shirt was - it hung round in a court. Witness. She had gone some yards before I took her.(Property produced and sworn to.)

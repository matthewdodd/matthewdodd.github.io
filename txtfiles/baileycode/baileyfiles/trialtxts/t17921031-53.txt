                   Poore
               



            ; I left the door padlocked, it is a ground floor; I went in and found the hasp was gone, and the door was broke open; I pursued up the alley, and called stop thief! when I gave the alarm, he dropped the sheet; there was a man took hold of him and brought him back to the top of Farmer-street, and the officer took him to the watch-house; the staple was drawn and a piece broke off the door; (looks towards the bar); that is the man; the sheet was dropped about one hundred yards from where I live, I am a single woman and have two rooms; I am very sure my door was fastened, I shewed the door to Phillips and the constable.
Prisoner. It is very hard for a man to have his life sworn away, she is a common prostitute on the town.

I am a biscuit baker, I live at No. 2, Lower Gun-alley; about a quarter before ten, on the 25th of September, I was going along Shadwell High-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! the prisoner was running as hard as he could and I stopped him, and Abberley assisted me to take him back into Farmer-street; the woman said that is the man; we then went to the house, and the staple was gone, and a piece of the wainscot torn away.

On the 25th of September, I was going along Shadwell, and this girl charged the prisoner with breaking open her room; I examined the room and found it had been broke open, as before described. (The sheet produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix).

Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. COMMON SERJEANT.

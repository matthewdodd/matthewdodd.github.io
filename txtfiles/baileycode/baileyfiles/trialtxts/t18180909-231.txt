            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. On the 28th of June, at three o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Kew informed me that she saw the prisoner hide a plane under some dung. I went, overtook him, and found the saw under his coat - I asked him how he came by it? he said he saw a poor man put it down in Castle-street, and he picked it up. I took him back to Mrs. Kew; she said he was the man, and gave him in charge.

                  , from his person
            .
WILLIAM MORLAND. I lodge in Gray's-inn-lane. On the 5th of April, I was at the corner of Portpool-lane


, about four o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner came up to me, and snatched a 5s. paper of copper out of my jacket pocket - she tore them open, and shook them into her apron - another woman, who was with her, took a handful, and put them into her bosom, and she ran off - I seized the prisoner's apron, and did not let it go until the officer took her - I was sober, but I think she was tipsy.
Prisoner. Q. Do you know the woman who was giving you vinegar to drink? A. I had no vinegar - I was not talking to any woman.

             (police-constable G 86). I took the prisoner from the prosecutor - I found some pence in her apron - the prosecutor said she had robbed him of 5s. worth of copper - the prisoner said, "Here it is" - I said,"Give it me" - she untied her apron, and gave it me - the prisoner did not deny it at the time, but when she got to the station-house, she said it was part of the change of two bad half-crowns she had passed that day.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that as she was passing, the prosecutor accused a woman with robbing him, who run on to a public-house; and he seized her by mistake.)

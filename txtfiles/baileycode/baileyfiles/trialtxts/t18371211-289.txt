WILLIAM HARRISON
. I reside at Leeds. I acted as guard to the Express coach on the journey up from Leeds, on Sunday, the 26th of November—I took the place of a man named Howard for that journey—the coach arrived at the Bull and Mouth about ten o'clock in the morning—it drove into the yard—I had a carpet bag with me which belonged to myself—I had received from the Yorkshire District Bank two parcels directed to

Williams and Co., London, and another from another Bank addressed to Jones and Lloyd—I placed them in my own bag—when the coach armed in the yard I got down and saw the passengers leave the coach—I had the bag in my hand when the passengers left, and then put it by the side of the coach-office window—a passenger came back to ask for a parcel he had left which had been taken into the coach-office—I then laid my bag down by the coach-office window, and went in to fetch the parcel—I was hardly gone a moment, and when I came back my bag was gone—I saw the prisoner going out the back way of the Bull-and-Mouth with my bag under his arm—that would lead him into Bull-and-Mouth-street—he had a Macintosh cape which covered the bag—he had got about five yards from the coach-office door—I followed and stopped him, and said, "What are you going to do with that carpet bag? that is my carpet bag"—he said a gentleman had ordered him to take it to a cab—I took him into the office—I then said he was a vagabond for taking my bag—he said I was too harsh with him, he had merely taken the bag out of a mistake—a policeman was sent for, who came and took him into custody—he was dressed in a surtout coat, black waistcoast, and had a gold chain round his neck—he had quite the appearance of a gentleman—this it the bag—(looking at it)—the covers of the parcel are now in it—there was no name or address on the bag.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you told any body that you had put such valuable property into the bag? A. No—it did not get wind that there was so much property in it, that I know—we had three outside passengers and one inside—some of them were gentlemen—the prisoner said a gentleman had ordered him to take it to a cab which was waiting outside—I did not go out to look for a cab.


MR. BODKIN. Q. How do you receive these parcels? are they brought to you at the coach? A. They are brought by the porters of the Banks to me—persons travelling by the coach might have the opportunity of seeing me receive such parcels—no gentleman came afterwards to ask for any bag, to my knowledge.





JOHN FROST
. I am a lace-manufacturer, living in Wood-street travelled by the Express coach from Leeds—I waited till the front boot was emptied'of parcels, and then applied to the guard for a parcel of mine—he left me to go into the office, and brought it out—I did not notice the bag in his hand.





JOHN WADE
. I am a policeman. I was sent for to the Bull-and Mouth on the Sunday morning in question, and found the prisoner there—he was given into my custody—I searched him, and found five sovereigns, a silver watch, a pencil case, and a gold chain, on him—I took the bag to Jones and Lloyd's banking-house, and left it there sealed up—I took a receipt for it—I then took the prisoner to the Compter—I got the bag next day from Jones and Lloyd's with my seal unbroken—I was present when the parcels in the bag were opened—they contained a variety of bills, Bank-notes, and promissory notes, which I left with the bankers, Jones and Lloyd, and Williams and Deacon—two parcels were addressed to them containing bills and promissory notes—I left them with their clerks—these are the wrappers of the parcels—(producing them)—the total amount was 11,373l. odd.





JAMES COWLETT DRAKE
. I am clerk to Messrs. Jones and Lloyd bankers. I have an account of the securities contained in the parcel brought to our house by the policeman, and opened at Guildhall in his

presence—it contained country Bank-notes and bills of exchange—I pro duce four £5 notes of the Halifax Joint Stock Bank which were in it among others—I applied the rest of the securities to the accounts of the parties.





JAMES KER
. I am clerk to Williams and Co., bankers in London. I produce part of the securities contained in the two parcels addressed to our house—here are four £5 notes of a country Bank—the other securities have been placed to the credit of the Banks.





GEORGE BECKSON
. I am clerk to the Yorkshire District Banking Company in their establishment at Leeds. I saw these two parcels, which are addressed to Williams and Deacon, sent off—they contained a variety of securities and bills of exchange—I cannot say whether these notes were among them, but there were such notes.





WILLIAM BACE
. I am clerk to Bush and Masters, solicitors for the prosecution. I produce a certified copy of a return made to the Stamp office respecting the Yorkshire District Bank—I saw it signed by a com missioner of stamps—(this being ready James Scan was named as one of the principal officers.)





JOHN ELLIS
. I am principal watchman at the Bull-and-Mouth. I know the prisoner by sight—I have seen him several times at the Bull-and Mouth—I think I had seen him somewhere within a week of the day the parcel was stolen, hut I will not be positive—he was walking about there like a gentleman, leisurely—I took him to be a respectable gentleman.




GUILTY
. Aged 43.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Littledale.

ISAAC MILLER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
19th of August, 1 parasol, value 5s., the goods of 



Stafford Allen.






JAMES HIPPER
. I live opposite the prosecutor, in Cowper-street. On the 19th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was sitting in my room—I saw the two prisoners, and another with them, pass the prosecutor's door, which was ajar—one of them touched the others, the door went open, and in about two minutes the two prisoners came back, looked into the hall, and spoke to each other—Fox placed his back against the door-post, pushed the door open, and went in—he shut the door—Miller stood outside, and in about half a minute Fox came out with the parasol under his coat, and gave it to Miller—they went on—I went down and passed them—I then turned and took Miller—he had not got he parasol then—Fox went off, and I called to a man who stopped him—the parasol was brought by a neighbour, who had had it thrown down his area.





STAFFORD ALLEN
. This is my parasol—it had been hanging in my hall for some days.

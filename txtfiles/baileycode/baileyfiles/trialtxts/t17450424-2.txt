            . The prisoner came to Mr. Rigg's in Pall Mall


, produced a pass, and asked for charity, but they refused it; I saw her take the handkerchiefs off the shopboard, she held her apron up to screen her from being seen, and swept them into her apron. - I happened to be on the other side of the way, and saw her do it. I took hold of her, and asked her where the handkerchiefs were that she took off the shopboard. She spoke as if she could not speak, and seemed a sort of a dumb [the prisoner had seemingly an impediment in her speech] I took the handkerchiefs from her and delivered them to Mr. Riggs.
Prisoner. The wind was very high that day and had blown them down upon the ground, and I took them off the ground.

 Sugden

, was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of April 1 shawl, value 6s. 6d., the goods of 




Daniel Smith.






DANIEL SMITH
. I live in Kent-street, Borough, and am a butcher. I had this shawl safe on the morning of the 15th of April, in my parlour.





GEORGE SMITH
. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 15th of April, the prisoner came to my father's parlour, and sent me for the key of the back shed—she was the servant next door—as I was coming back with the key, I met her going out of the back-door, with the shawl—she was not very drunk—she had had a little.






MARY ANN ASKEW
. I am housekeeper to Mr. Smith. This shawl is his—George told me that the prisoner had gone out with the shawl—I ran after her, and took her with it—I think she was in liquor—I knew her by living a servant next door—I asked her to give it to me—she would not.

Prisoner. She is unfortunate like myself, and we lived in one house together for a month—being in liquor, I suppose I took the shawl—I have taken her things to wear many times.





MARY ANN ASKEN
. I never lived with hershe never took my things to wear.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

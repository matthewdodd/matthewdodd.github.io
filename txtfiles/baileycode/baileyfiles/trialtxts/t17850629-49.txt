Coming over London Bridge


 this day fortnight, about two o'clock, I suddenly felt a change in the weight on the right side of my coat, I turned about and I could not see no person near me, nor any person gone from me; a person pointed to the prisoner, and I took him to Alderman Saunderson, I was then going to Alderman Wright's, and in passing from the bridge up St. Martin's-lane, I was in conversation with the prisoner, and the person was saying, he believed the prisoner had made away with the property, and give it to another man; says the prisoner he is a false man, for the other man has not got the handkerchief, here is the handkerchief, he pulled it out and gave it to me; the handkerchief was mine, I took him to Guildhall and he was committed.
LANCELOTT HUDDON sworn.
I saw three gentlemen standing against the wall, and the prosecutor was coming by, I thought I saw the prisoner take his handkerchief, and put it behind his coat.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I saw a crowd of people, coming by the handkerchief was thrown down close to my feet, and I picked it up, when the gentleman came up to me, I gave him the handkerchief directly.
The prisoner called one witness to his character.

WILLIAM HADDON. I am a mariner
, and belong to the brig Martin. The prisoner was employed by the mate to assist in clearing the vessel, on the 6th of June; these articles were in a bag in the state-room; I missed them while the prisoner was on board; I suspected him, and said,"What do you mean to do with the things of mine, which you have stolen;" he said he had not taken them - he had got my trousers on under his own, and my stockings on; I took them off, and told him to go about his business - he went away, and was taken five days after.

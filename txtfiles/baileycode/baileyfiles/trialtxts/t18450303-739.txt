WILLIAM ALEXANDER
 was indicted

for stealing 2 hats, value 14s.; 2 umbrellas, 5s.; and 1 pair of gloves, 1s.; the goods of 



Thomas Spencer; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE TOLLET
. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Spencer, of No. 31, Myddleton-square. At half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of Feb. I was sweeping the snow from the door—I had left the street door open—the butcher called—I ran to the corner, and saw the prisoner drop these two hats, two umbrellas, and a pair of gloves of my master's, which were in the hall about two minutes before.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. How do you know Mr. Spencer's

name is Thomas? A. I have seen it on several occasions, and he has been called so.





WILLIAM HENRY SHEENRY
. I know the prosecutor's name is Thomas Spencer, and all these things are his.





GEORGE VAUGHAN
 (police-constable G 48.) I stopped the prisoner hearing the cry of "Stop thief!"—I took him back to the house, and they identified these things which Tolley had picked up.





THOMAS HANSLOW
 (police-constable F 10.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted the 8th of May, 1843, and confined six months)—he is the person—he has been in custody four times since that.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

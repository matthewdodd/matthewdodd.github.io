            . On Easter Monday about 1 o' clock , I had my pocket picked in the Poultry


, of a pair of white linen drawers. McDonald asked me if I had not my pocket picked; I said, yes, of a pair of drawers; he said, he would carry me to the person that had them; and they were found upon Underhill, and he said that Sykes would not have done it, if he had not been in liquor - He did not make any excuse for himself.

            . On Easter Monday I went towards Grocers hall, to see if I could find any of these fellows picking of pockets; as I was going along, I saw Sykes put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out, as I thought, a white cambrick handkerchief. I asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing; he said, yes: I said, come a little farther, and I'll show you who has it, and I came up to the prisoners. Sykes had given the drawers to Underhill, and I took them from him; and Underhill said, if Sykes had not been in liquor he would not have done it. Both 


               Guilty 10 d.

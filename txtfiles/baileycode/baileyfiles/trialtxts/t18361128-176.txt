EDWARD SHEPHERD
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of September, 1 guard-chain, value 4l. 15s. the goods of 



Richard Chitty.






RICHARD CHITTY
. This is my guard-chain, I know it by the weight and make. The prisoner came on the 4th of September, and asked me to let him have a guard-chain to show a friend of his at Hackney—I said I would, but I would not give him credit—he was to return the chain or money in day or two—this went on three weeks or a month—I got no chain or

money.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What does it weigh? A. 1oz. 5 dwts.—I should scarcely believe that there were any others of the same weight and description—the variation of the size will cause a difference of the weight.





JAMES HOWELL
. I produce the chain which was pledged by the prisoner. 


GUILTY
. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years more.

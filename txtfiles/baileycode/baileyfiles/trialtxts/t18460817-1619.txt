1619. 




JOHN LINEHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 pair of boots, value 1s. 6d.; the goods of 




Mary Ann Richards; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






MARY ANN RICHARDS
. I am cook in the service of Mr. Pemberton of St. George's-terrace, Kensington. These boots are mine, and were safe on a shelf in the area on Saturday night, 25th July.





ROBERT TURNER
. On Sunday morning, 26th July, about half-past six, I was in a lane near Brompton, and saw the prisoner and another get over the iron rails into an area—I went up and saw the boots lying on a handkerchief partly on the mat and partly on the flagstone—I saw the prisoner putting some brushes into the handkerchief—when I spoke to him he put them back and tried to escape—I rung the bell and he was given into custody.





EDWARD SIMES
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 10th of June, 1844, and confined twelve month)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

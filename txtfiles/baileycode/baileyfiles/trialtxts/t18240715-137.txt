. There was a bowl in my bar, containing four or five shillings worth of farthings; two sixpences, and a penny-piece; I missed it on Saturday night between eleven and twelve o'clock; the prisoner was in the house at the time. Ellis produced the bowl to me.

            . I am Mr. Burch's servant - I saw the prisoner standing by the street door; and watched him, suspecting him, and as I went into the tap-room, I saw him put his hand round the bar window and take the bowl and put it into his hat; he bolted out as quick as he could, we pursued, but happened to go the wrong way; master went with me and took him coming out of his mother's house; he lived there with her; and the officer found the bowl there.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - I went to his mother's and found the bowl inside the fire place - it was a wet night - I went into the yard and found the dust heap had been disturbed, and found a quantity of farthings, and two sixpences in a bag there.
(Bowl produced and sworn to.)

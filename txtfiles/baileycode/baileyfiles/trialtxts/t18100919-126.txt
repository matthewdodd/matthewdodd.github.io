            .
JAMES KEENE. I am a bargeman
, I live at Wey-bridge. On the 2nd of May my barge was in the Thames, laying at Allhollow-stairs


, facing of the Steel-yard, on the London side of the river, between one and two o'clock I went on shore, I left in the chest a great coat of 
               
                  John 
                  Keene
               



            , a great coat and a close-bodied coat of mine; the chest was locked, I had the key in my pocket, my pocket-book was in my close-bodied coat pocket, and in my pocket-book was a two pound bank note and two one pound bank notes, and a couple of handkerchiefs in the coat pocket. The chest was in the barge, under the stern sheets, under the tilt, that we call a cabin; I returned to the barge in about a quarter of an hour, I found the chest had been broken open and all these things were gone.
Q. Do you know any thing to affect the prisoners of their being the persons that committed it of your own knowledge - A. I cannot say any thing about that; I know them, I have seen them rowing in a waterman's boat.
Q. Did you afterwards see any of these cloths - A. Yes, about a month ago I saw the two great coats only at the Mansion-house, I knew them to be mine and my brother's coat.


                  JAMES 
                  WHITNEY
               



            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Merwin, pawnbroker. 17, St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough. I produce two coats pawned on the 2nd of May, between the hours of three and six in the afternoon, I took them in of 
               
                  Charity 
                  Duvall
               



            , I advanced ten shillings on them, they were pledged in the name of Dark.
CHARITY DUVALL. I live in Prinney's gardens in the Maze in the Borough.
Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I know them both, I washed for 
               
                  Leonard 
                  West
               



            . West came into my house alone and brought these coats, he asked me to pledge them; he left the coats with me. It was about half past two, I was hanging out my clothes when he came, I did not pledge them then, I was busy; he came the second time, Vincent was with him, and the third time Vincent and West were together; the first time West was alone, Vincent did not interfere with it, only came with him. I pawned the coats for ten shillings at Mr. Merwin's, I gave the money and the duplicate to West, he put down a shilling, he sent for a pot of porter and took the change. I had only a share of the pot of porter. That is all I know of the business.

Q. Did West ever call upon you after this - A. Yes, but never said any thing about the coats nor Vincent either.
Mr. Reynolds. I should like to know what you are - A. I am a poor hard-working woman.
Q. How long after they had been with you and desired you to pawn these coats, were they taken up - A. I cannot say I know when Vincent and West were in Newgate the first time.
Q. You never went and gave any information when they were taken up - A. No, it was not worth while. If I had known they were not their coats, I should not have pawned them.
Q. You never communicated any thing about it till you were taken up, and then you charged them - A. I had my house searched, I was taken to Horsemonger-lane, I was had up three times to Union-hall, and the last time I came before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Pinner
               



             he cleared me; before that I was taken before the Lord Mayor about these coats, I told the same story there as I do now, that 
               
                  Leonard 
                  West
               



             gave me them to pawn.


                  JOHN 
                  BRANT
               



            . I am a waterman and lighterman, I know both the prisoners. On the 2nd of May, as I was coming through bridge, I saw them both in a boat by themselves, they were rowing from Horseshoe-alley to the Steel-yard; they rowed alongside of Keene's barge; this was about a quarter or twenty minutes before two; 
               
                  Leonard 
                  West
               



             got on board, and Vincent held the boat alongside; West staid a-board five or ten minutes, I did not see West come out, I saw them row up through Blackfriars-bridge, as I was making my barge fast they went through the middle arch, they rowed towards the Surry side.


                  JOHN 
                  GOFF
               



            . I am a police officer of Union-hall. I apprehended the two prisoners on the 3d of May, in company with another officer; I found a knife with a picker to it upon West, and one upon Vincent, this picker opens this padlock, I have tried it. When I apprehended Vincent, I told him the nature of the charge, he said, if he might be admitted an evidence, he would tell what he knew. He spoke to the Lord Mayor, the Lord Mayor would not admit him.

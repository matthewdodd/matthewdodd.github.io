            . I live in New-street, Black Fryars


. On the 23d of Feb. I lett the prisoner a lodging, ready furnished; he continued in the lodging nine days. I missed a sheet when he had been there five days; after that I missed the tea-kettle and curtain. He at first denied having taken them.
Mrs. Gee. The prisoner did not work while he was in the lodging. I went up and missed the sheet first; the Tuesday following I missed the window curtain: I have seen the sheet since, and swore to it, at Mr. Simonds's in Night-Rider's-street. The prisoner owned to me he had taken the goods and pawned them. (The curtain produced and deposed to.)

            . I am servant to Mr. Simonds. This curtain was pledged at our house by the prisoner the 5th of March. The sheet is at our house; my master thought it too dirty to bring. The kettle is at our house also.

My wife pawned the sheet and tea-kettle. After that the curtain was wrapped up in a piece of cloth; my wife desired me to go and pawn it for a shilling, which I did.




               Guilty of stealing the curtain only, 10 d.

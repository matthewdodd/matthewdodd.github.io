. The prisoner worked journey-work
 for me, in my house; he had a quantity of thimbles in hand, which he had not finished; and he not coming to his work, I went to the house of Mr. Lord, where he lodged, to see for him: Mr. Lord told me he was removed from his apartment, and gone to Change-court, behind Exeter-Change. I went with Mr. Lord there; then the prisoner said he would come to work: he come same days about 12 o'clock, and would go away at five: Mr. Lord asked me whether I ever gave the prisoner leave to sell thimbles for me? I told him I had not. He delivered me three out of his pocket, and said he had sold five; that the whole eight he had of the prisoner at the bar. Last Saturday was a week, the prisoner said to me, Mr. Lord made himself very busy; he did not know what business he had to trouble himself with him; and that he had got some thimbles which a man had bought a dozen of, and had let him have eight to sell: I asked him what trade that man was, and his name? he said his name was Shields, a silver-turner, on Saffron-hill: the afternoon following, I went to one Mr. Porter there, and asked if he knew one Shields that lived there? he said, he did, and he was a shoemaker. In the mean time, Shields came by; he said he never dealt in silver, or thimbles in his life. (The thimbles produced in court.) I know by the flowering round them, they are made with my tools, and there is my mark upon them: I have no doubt of their being mine.

            . I had a young woman came to dine with me one Sunday, who was an acquaintance of the prisoner's; he made her a present of a silver thimble, and she left it with me to have her name engraved on it: I shewed it my shop-mate, and he wanted another for his daughter. I asked the prisoner for another, and he pulled eight out of his pocket, and left them with me to sell: I sold five for him, at eighteen-pence each, and gave him the money, and when I found the prosecutor had not delivered them to the prisoner to sell, I returned the other three to him.
Prisoner's Defence.
Please to ask the prosecutor whether ever he trusted me to sell thimbles for him.
Prosecutor to the Question. I once trusted him with some metal ones, badly gilded, which I have still by me; but I never did trust him with any other.

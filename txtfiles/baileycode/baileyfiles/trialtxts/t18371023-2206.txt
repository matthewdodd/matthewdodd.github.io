MARY SMITH
 and 



SARAH SMITH
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
27th of September, 1 pair of boots, value 4s. 6d., the goods of 



John Aaron.






WILLIAM BURNELL
. I was shopman to Mr. John Aaron, a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road, on the 27th of September; I have left him since. On the evening of that day I saw the prisoner, Mary Smith, in the shop—she offered to pawn a pillow, which our foreman refused to take in, and when she was gone I missed a pair of boots directly—I did not see Sarah in the shop.





JOHN GERRARD
. I am a policeman; I live in New-road, Cannon-street. In consequence of information I received, I went to look for the prisoners—I looked into Mr. Burnell's shop and saw the prisoner, Mary Smith, who had passed me before—she had a pillow in a bundle—I stopped till she came out, and then asked what she had got—she said, "Nothing but an old pillow"—I asked her if it was black or white-she said I knew the colour of a pillow as well as her—I asked to look at it—she was very loath to give it me, and the moment I laid hold of it the boots dropped from the middle of it—I said she must go with me—Sarah Smith was about a yard from her, and directly followed us up towards Mr. Aaron's shop—I had a pillow in one hand and a pair of boots in the other—Sarah Smith laid hold of her arm and of my arm to try to rescue her from me—I told her to be quiet and let her alone, but she still kept hold of her—I called Aaron's shopman out, and told him to take bold of her.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Mary Smith. Sarah Smith was not near me till I got to Brick-lane, when I was in custody, and asked what was the matter with me.

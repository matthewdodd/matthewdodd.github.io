            . I am a smith
, and live in Philip-street, St. George's East


. On the 7th of May, between five and six o'clock, I went home, and missed these weights; they were safe on my stall before the door at four o'clock;

             pointed out the prisoners; I pursued and took Whitmarsh; four others were in his company; one of them ran away, and another joined them; I took Collins; he threw the weights down, and a boy picked them up in my presence.

            . I live opposite Butler. I was working at the window between five and six o'clock, and saw three lads come round the corner, one went into the shop and the prisoners stood at the stall, and they took up several things and looked at them. I saw Whitmarsh take something up and give it to Collins, who put it into his pocket. Whitmarsh took something else, and they went away laughing - the one who went into the shop ran out. I went and told Butler.

            . I am master of the Southgate coach
, which starts from the Four Swans' yard, Bishopsgate-street


. On the 5th of February I missed Mr. Goad's coat off the boot, and saw the prisoner behind another coach with it it in his hand. I made him pick it up and take it into the house, and found he had another coat on his back, which belonged to me.

            . I took the prisoner in charge, and found two silk handkerchiefs on him; also a silk handkerchief in Dancer's coat. As we went to the watch-house another handkerchief fell from his trowsers, and I saw another coming out of the bottom of his trowsers; I found a third in his trowsers - the prosecutor said he also lost a blue coat. I went to the watch-house, and the prisoner came up without a coat, but he had it on when I took him.

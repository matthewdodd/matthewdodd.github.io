WILLIAM KEDOR
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of October, 1 carpet, value 2l., the goods of 



James William Thompson.






THOMAS KELLY
. I am a policeman. On the 23rd of October, I was in Short's-gardens, leading out of Drury-lane, a little after ten o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner carrying this large carpet—knowing him I crossed to him, and asked what he had got—he said a carpet which he had found at a door-way—I asked where—he looked round, threw the carpet at me, and ran away—I pursued, and took him in St. Giles's—he made several struggles to get away, but I kept him, and found the owner on Monday.





WILLIAM STEGGETT
. I am a porter. I was passing up Short's-gardens—I saw the prisoner chuck the carpet, and nearly knock the policeman down—he called to me to mind the carpet, which I did.





JAMES WILLIAM THOMPSON
. I am an upholsterer, and live in South Moulton-street. This is my carpet—it was exposed at my door for sale on the 22nd, and I missed it the same evening.

Prisoner's Defence. As I was going to work, I saw this carpet lie at a door-way—I knocked at the door and asked whether it belonged to them—they said no, and told me to go higher up—I went, but could not find the owner—they told me to go to Long Acre, which I did, but there were no shops there—I then came back, and this officer laid hold of me.




GUILTY
.** Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

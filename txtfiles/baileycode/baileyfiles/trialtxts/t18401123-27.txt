. was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of October, 30 pairs of stays, value 3l. 2s.; and 6 pairs of boots, value 20s.; the goods of

LEWIS THOMAS. I am in partnership with William Thomas. We lost

thirty pairs of stays and six pairs of boots at the end of October—these are them—(looking at them)—they were taken from a truck.





EDWARD JACOB RODMELL
. I am porter to Mr. Brothers, in Cheapside. About six o'clock in the evening on the 24th of October, I was drawing a truck with two paper parcels, a trunk, and two boxes—some one told me something—I looked, and missed this parcel—I saw the prisoner with it in his arms—I went after him—he was walking on the pavement—I collared him, and told him the parcel was taken from my truck—he said it was found at his feet, and afterwards that a man had put it into his arms—he struggled to get away—he knocked my hat off, and got a short distance.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Noble-street; a man threw it into my arms—this young man said, "You have stolen my parcel;" I said, "No," I had picked it up; he collared me; I said, "Don't collar me;" he said, "I shall;" I never lifted my hand to him.
(The prisoner received a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

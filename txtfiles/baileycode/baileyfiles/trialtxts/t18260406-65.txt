WILLIAM JAMES PORTER. I live in Old Broad-street, with my father, who is a callenderer. On the 1st of April. these stockings were in my coat pocket in Bishopsgate-street


, at half-past five o'clock in the afternoon; I felt them safe just before they were taken - on missing them I turned round and saw somebody holdign the prisoner; I asked him for them, he said he had not got them, and pointed down to the ground, where he had thrown them.

            . I am an upholsterer, and live in Bishopsgate without. I saw Porter at my shop window - the prisoner and two others were about three yards from him; Porter stooped down to speak to my brother, and I saw the prisoner take a parcel out of his trouser's pocket, and walk out; I laid hold of him and said "You took that parcel out of that boy's pocket" - he denied it; I turned and saw it on the ground close by him - nobody but him cluld drop it.

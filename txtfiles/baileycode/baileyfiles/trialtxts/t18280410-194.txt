            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 26th of March, at a quarter-past seven in the evening, I met the prisoner between the Elephant and Castle and Newington Church; he had something in his jacket; I thought it was wrong, and looked at him; he set off running, and threw down this pracel - I pursued and took him; Shepherd took up the parcel of tobacco, and by the permit we found the owner.

            . I was with Lord - his evidence is correct; I picked up the parcel.
JOSEPH WARD. I keep a shop
 at Tottenham, Middlesex


. This tobacco is mine, and was lost from my counter; I did not miss it till the officers brought it; I should think from the manner I was engaged that it was taken about six o'clock in the evening.

. On the 26th of June, the prisoner came to live with me as pot-boy
 - on the 30th I sent him with beer to Mrs. Robinson's - he came back, and said, "Master, does not Mrs. Robinson owe you for three pints of beer?" I said, "Yes;" he said, "If you will have the kindness to give her change for a sovereign, she will pay you;" I counted him out half-a-sovereign, three half-crowns, and 2s. 6d. in silver; he took it, but did not come back; I never saw him again till he was in the hands of the officer, on the 5th of July.

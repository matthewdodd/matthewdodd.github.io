            . On the 1st of April, at eleven o'clock in the evening I was in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles'


. I was not quite sober; three women came out of a court, and wished me to go with them; I refused - I had the lease of a house in my coat pocket; and some silver in my breeches pocket - they took a handkerchief off my neck, and ran away with it; I cannot swear to either of their persons.

            . I am a Police-constable. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his handkerchief - I got a candle, and found the prisoner with this handkerchief in her pocket; she said she did not know any thing about it - here is a greasy place in the corner of it, which he had described.

            . I have no doubt this is my handkerchief; it is a new one - and mine was a new one, and has some grease at one corner.
Prisoner's Defence. I found it, and put it into my pocket.

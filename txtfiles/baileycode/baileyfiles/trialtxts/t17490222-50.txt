Rebeccah Chessey. I heard my hens make a noise, and I went into the hen roost; I saw one hanging with her head downwards; I went to take hold of it, and took hold of the Prisoner's hand; I went immediately out, and lock'd him in. I had a neighbour at my house, and we went and took him out, and a neighbour of mine brought me another of my hens, he had sold her about seven that night.

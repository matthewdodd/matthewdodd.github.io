 at Brentford


: I lost some lead from my pump in the yard; it was a leaden pipe to convey water out of the river Brent to serve the yard; I missed it the 16th of May; there were five yards taken away. About two o'clock I was going into my yard, and was informed the prisoner, Baily, had stole my pump; I went to the pump and found it was gone; I went to Mr. Glover's, who buys lead, and there I found about four or five feet of it; I took it, and tried it to the part where it was broke off, and the joint fitted; I can swear it is my property.

            . The prisoner brought the lead to my sister; she called me to him; I told him I did not like it, and would not buy it; I stopped it; I went with Chalk and compared it; it appeared to me to be the same lead that was broke of. (The lead produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) There was a bit left to the pump that was not stole.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found that pump in the river, at a place where we fetch water.

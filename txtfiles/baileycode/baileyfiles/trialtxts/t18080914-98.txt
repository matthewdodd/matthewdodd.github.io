            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; he is a gentleman's coachman
.
Q. Did you lose a gown and a pelisse - A. Yes, on the 13th of August, out of my room.
Q. You did not see the prisoner take it did you - A No.
Q. When did you see your property before it was stolen - A. Not five minutes before; I was sweeping the stairs, the prisoner passed me.
Q. Was this in a lodging house - A. Yes, it was; she was going up stairs, I did not stop her, I did not know she was going up to my room; there are other lodgers in the house.

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker - A. Yes; a gown was pledged at my house; I cannot say as to the prisoner pawning it; the prisoner came a few days after the gown was pawned, and being informed by my young man that she was the person that pledged it, I detained her; she came to pledge something else. I asked her what she had done with the ticket of the gown that she had pledged on the 13th of August; she gave me the ticket.
The property produced and identified.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any one to her character.

. On the 6th of April, I saw all my fowls safe, and missed one in the evening; they were in an enclosed yard, and had the run of the stables; the prisoner is a carman, and attends a horse on my premises.

            . On the 6th of April, I was in Pewter-platter-yard. I saw the prisoner take up a duck, and put it into his pocket; I fetched the owner of it - he gave it up, and was set at liberty; I then saw the legs of this fowl sticking out of his pocket - I told an officer, who took him, he said he bought it between Old-street, and Brick-lane.

            . I am an officer, and took him in charge; he had a handkerchief full of salt fish and potatoes, and 1s. 8d. in his pocket - he was tipsy, and would not tell me where he got the fowl; he afterwards said he had bought it, but would not say where - Beetle's claimed it.
Prisoner's Defence. I gave 1s. 9d. for it.

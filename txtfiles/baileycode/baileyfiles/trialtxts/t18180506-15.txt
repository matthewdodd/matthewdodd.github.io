JOSEPH PORCH. I keep the King's Arms, in Leaden-hall-street




. On Saturday the 25th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I left the bar for a few minutes, on my return I found the prisoner going out with the articles stated in the indictment in his hand - He had taken them off a guard before the fire-place-on hearingme he dropped them in a chair, and was going out of the kitchen door; my wife came in front, caught him by the arm, and asked him what business he had there? he said he wanted the parlour - He afterwards said he came out of the tap; which was impossible, as it had been shut up above half an hour. I gave him in charge. I never saw the prisoner before.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

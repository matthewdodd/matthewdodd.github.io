I asked the Boy (the Prisoner ) whether he was not concern'd in the Robbery: The Prisoner owned he was concerned with Hudson in stealing six Pair of Shoes out of the Shop of Mr. Lang; and that Hudson sold them for 2 s. a Pair: I ask'd how he came into the Shop with that Pair; he said he had them from Hudson; he did not say that he gave any Thing to Hudson for them.
Court. You say he was concerned with Hudson; Did he tell you what Part Hudson acted, and what Part he acted ?

Q. What did you take out of this Shop?
Hudson. We took out eight Pair of Shoes and Pumps, and an odd one.
Q. Where were they?
Hudson. They were in the Shop Window.
Q. How did you get them out?
Hudson. We broke a Pane of Glass; he broke one Piece, and I broke another.
Q. Who reach'd the Shoes out?
Hudson. He reach'd some, and I reach'd some.
Q. What did you do with them afterwards?
Hudson. He, the Prisoner, carried them away, and we sold them together.
Q. Did you sell them altogether?
Hudson. Yes, all but a Pair he kept, and a Pair I kept; but I lost mine.
Q. What did you sell them for?

                  Q. 
               


            (to - Charles.) What do you know of this Matter ?
Charles. Sir, this Lad's Father lives by me; he brought me here on Wednesday last, to tell what I know of him; the Boy has been very honest. He has a Step-mother, and was turn'd out; and what he has done these three or four Years I cannot tell. He was clear'd by the Court last Wednesday. His Father knew that I had some Friends in St. Thomas's Hospital, and he wanted me to get his Son in there for a Distemper.
Q. What Distemper?
Charles. I believe the Fonl Disease. I went Yesterday to Lang's Shop, the Prosecutor, and he told me he had a great Misfortune, he said he had been robb'd, &c. and, said he, 'tis by one Hudson: The Boy was by, and made Answer, that he was try'd Yesterday; and, says Lang, Are you clear'd; Yes, Sir, said he, I am. So he stoop'd down and took that Shoe in his Hand, and said, These are my Shoes, I will swear to them; and he said to me, Do you know any thing of this Boy's Character: I said, I never heard any thing amiss of him.

Q. What do you know of the Prisoner?
Carew. I knew nothing by him, 'till this present Time, but what was just and honest. I have liv'd in his Father's House, and work'd with him several Years, and knew nothing amiss of the Lad. The Man that swore these Shoes were his, swears that they broke a Pane of Glass: We ask'd him whether this Pane was broke, and he own'd that it was crack'd before.

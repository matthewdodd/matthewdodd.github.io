Wheeler. Price said at first that Wild was concerned in taking them . Dumbleton said the decanters were at one White's in George Alley, by the Fleet Market. I went and left word at White's that some boys had stole some of our decanters, and sold them to them; and if they did not send them I should come after them; and in a little time a woman brought some of the decanters.

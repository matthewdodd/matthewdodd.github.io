, the 10th of June
 last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Cloth hung out at her Window for Show, and she being gone up Stairs, her Neighbour call'd to her, asking her, if she would stay there, and let her Shop be Robb'd? That she came down, but they had got the Cloth, and ran away with it, but were afterwards taken; and one of them confess'd that it had been Sold in Rag-Fair.

             depos'd, That she living over-against the Prosecutor, saw the Prisoner lurking about her Window, and suspecting them, ask'd them, what they had to do at her Window? That they gave her saucy Language, and she saw Wheeler take the Cloth, and Collins standing at a little Distance from him, and she going towards them, they ran away, she was positive to the Prisoners; the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them 


               Guilty each to the Value of 10 d.

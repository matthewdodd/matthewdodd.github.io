            . This is my flute - I value it at 5l.; they are sold for a great deal more; the silver and workmanship came to a great deal more - it is my own make.
Cross-examined. Q. Is your name on this? A. No, nor the unicorn; we do not always mark them directly they are finished - they are put into a drawer; there is no mark on it - I am certain it is my manufacture.
COURT. Q. Suppose a gentleman offered you 4l. 19s. for this flute, would you take it? A. No - I have given an under value.




               GUILTY (of stealing, to the value of 99s. only
            .) Aged 23.




               Transported for Seven Years, to commence from the expiration of his former sentence

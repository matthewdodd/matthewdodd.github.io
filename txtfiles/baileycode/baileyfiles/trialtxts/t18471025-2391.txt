WILLIAM FITCH
 was indicted

 for stealing 500 bricks, value 19s.; the goods of 




George Ekins Crane; having been before convicted of felony.







GEORGE EKINS CRANE.
 I am builder, in Royston-street. I am building houses in Old Ford-lane, Bow—on 16th Sept., in the morning, I received information, went to the buildings, and missed a load of bricks—I have never found them.





JOHN SAMUEL FOX.
 On 15th of Sept., eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner loading bricks from Mr. Crane's building, with a cart—I left him with the cart there half loaded, and went to my lodging, and in about half an hour they came by with a cart load of bricks, which appeared to be the same I had seen them loading the cart with.

Prisoner. Q. When I was loading them, did not you ask me and my brother what we were going to do with them? A. Yes, and you made me no answer—I told Mr. Crane at six o'clock next morning.





THOMAS DAVEY.
 The prisoner and his brother hired a stable of me, and on 15th of Sept., between nine and ten o'clock, I saw them drive a cart load of brick in, and next morning a little after seven, they drove them away,

Prisoner. Q. Why did I hire the stable? A. To put your horse in—you told me you were engaged in carting bricks, and that sort of thing.





GEORGE THREADGOLD.
 On 16th of Sept. the prisoner and his brother came to me, and offered a load of bricks for sale—I said, I was no buyer—they went away.

Prisoner's Defence. I own to offering them for sale; I have sold bricks before; I was hired to drive a load of bricks for Mr. Palmer.





WILLIAM ROWLAND
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted March, 1844, of stealing bricks, gad confined three months)—he is the person so tried and convicted.
(John Payne gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

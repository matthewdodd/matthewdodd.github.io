JOHN COOPER
 and 




JOHN WHITEHEAD
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
16th of August, a pocket-book, value 3s., the goods of 



Richard Nangle, from his person.






RICHARD NANGLE
. I am a bookbinder. I was near the House of Lords on the 16th of August, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I felt something drawn from my pocket—I turned, and the officer said that one of the prisoners had my pocket-book-Whitehead had it—it had been in my coat pocket—this is it—(looking at it.)





WILLIAM HOLLAND
. I am a policeman. I was on duty in plain clothes, and saw the two prisoners standing talking together-Cooper pointed to the prosecutor's pocket, and then Whitehead went to the pocket, lifted it up, put his hand in, and I saw him handling something red—I took him, and another officer took Cooper—I took the pocket-book out of Whitehead's hand the moment he took it out of the pocket-Cooper might not have seen him take it—they were not talking together a second hardly.

Whitehead's Defence. I was standing to see the Queen—the officer said he saw me with the pocket-book.

WHITEHEAD—


GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Years.

COOPER—


NOT GUILTY
.

            . The halfpence were in a till in the shop; my wife went out to market; the prisoner took the opportunity, knowing where the key of the shop was, to go in and take the halfpence; she confessed it when I took her.

            . I saw the prisoner in the shop near the till; I do not know what she was doing.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence, but called one witness, who said the prosecutor promised her pardon if she would confess, and would take it of her father at so much a week, which the prosecutor denied, and she called several witnesses to her character.

            , at the Cock in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street




. On the 22d or 23d of May early in the morning, our house was broke open: I was called up by the watchman between three and four o'clock; the first thing that I missed was my black coat and waistcoat, which I had wore at a burying the night before. I found the groove of the window of the tap-room was cut, and the shutter taken down and set against the door; I opened the door and the watchman came in. I missed a quart pewter mug, and a half-pint mug, a brandy bottle, an aniseed bottle, and a bitter bottle; we had had a large wash the day before, and we missed a large quantity of the things more than laid in the indictment, from out of the same room, all my property: I had been in that house but from that day se'nnight. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and had some hand-bills printed and dispersed about. I heard no more till last Sunday, the prisoners were taken up that evening. I was directed to Mr. Brebrook's house, there I saw some of the linen; I took this half pint mug yesterday morning out of the prisoner Cowen's room; they have scratched the name out, but I believe it to be my property; (produced in court.)

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. When I came down in the morning I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and more; I have seen some of them since at Mr. Brebrook's house, and swore to them.
Hyam Jacob. I am a Jew; I always sold the things for Israel Cowen that he received of the prisoners, he is a Jew. This day fortnight 
               
                  Ned

            , and Pat Fennel, came between three and four in the morning, and brought a white bag of linen; in it was three child's robes, three child's shifts, eight child's caps, three other shifts for a girl about eight or ten years old, two men's shirts, three bed-gowns, a shift, a black coat and waistcoat, a quart pewter mug, a half-pint pewter mug, and two gin bottles; they drank the gin out, and took the bottles with them; Israel Cowen bought them all for a guinea and a half; at the same time he and I lived in one house, he in the fore part, and I in the back part, up-stairs, at No 2. in Billiter-lane, he bought them in my room; he gave some to me to sell; I could not make the money he desired, and I brought them home again; after that I went over the water, and when I came back again, the things were all gone, but the quart and half-pint mugs, and the child's linen, which he kept for his own use, his wife is ready to lie in; I was taken up by Brebrook last Sunday, and then I told him of these things, and he went back and found the things in Cowen's room, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch; we removed to there.
Q. How long have you known Williams?
Jacob. I have known him half a year, and I have known 
               
                  Tom 
                  Peak 
               



             but about a fortnight; I never saw them in the day-time, they always used to come in the morning early; there was always a bell in Cowen's room, a string went from it down to the ground; we had used to put it out in the night, for them to ring when they came, and we took it up into the room in the day time; he used to give me something for my trouble when I have sold things for him; Cowen used to ask them where they took the things from, to be careful he did not send me in the same street to sell them.
Q. Where did they say they brought these things from?
Jacob. They said they brought them from Bishopsgate-street.

            . Last Sunday Mr. Todd, one of the prosecutors, came to me, and said his house had been broke open, and a young woman brought him his wife's tabby gown, and offered it to her for a guinea and a half, and if I would go along with him, we might get the remainder of the things; I and two more went directly with him, and into a house in the middle of Duke's Place, there I saw Lazarus Abraham, (who is now in Newgate;) I catched hold of him, and said, you must give an account how you came by this tabby gown; he said, if you will go along with me, I will shew you the party's that I had it of; I followed him down into Gravel-lane to a house, and up two pair of stairs, he burst the door open; out came the evidence Hyam and Israel Cowen both together; I said, keep the door safe, for I shall take you both in custody; I tied them together with my handkerchief, and searched Cowen's room; I there found some of Mr. Todd's goods, and some other people's goods, which they are not indicted for; I also found in his room a child's linen bed-gown, a half-pint pewter mug, a linen gown, three shirts, two waistcoats, eight caps, and three forehead cloths; (produced in court, deposed to by the prosecutor's wife, except the half-pint mug;) Hyam Jacob told me, Pat Farrel, or Fennil, and one Abbot, were concerned in these things, and that they had told him the things were taken from a house in Bishopsgate-street, but did not know the particular place; I took them to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , there they were examined; upon their examination, I went and took Peak on the Monday morning, either in Cross-lane, or Newtoner's-lane, in bed with a girl; he seemed to deny all; he said he happened to be in Petticoat-lane, and saw some of them, but he knew nothing of the affair; Sir John gave me an order to take Israel Cowen and Lazarus Abraham to Newgate; then I went to the Black Raven in Chick-lane, and there I took Williams; he had a coat on his back that belongs to the gentleman who has an indictment against him; (a bell with a spring to it produced;) this bell was nailed up against a window in Cowen's room, and a pane of glass broke, and on nights they used to put a rope down into the alley, and on the daytime draw it up; this the evidence told me, so I took it down to produce here; the two rooms joined together where Hyam Jacob and the prisoner lived.
Williams's defence.
I know no more about the things than the child unborn; I never in my life was out after ten o'clock; I was in bed at my mother's house at Islington, in a two pair of stairs room backwards, with my wife, the night this burglary was committed.
For Williams.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Williams 
               



             I am Williams's mother; I live at Islington, and sell greens; my boy has been at sea since he was ten or eleven years old; he came home the latter end of August or September last; he was at my house almost three weeks; about a fortnight ago he hurt his finger, and had a lame arm; he was never out, only going to Shadwell or Ratcliff-highway among his shipmates; he was generally in by nine at night; he was never out later as I know of.
Q. What room did he lie in at your house?
E. Williams. He lay up one pair of stairs; my house is between the White Swan and the Blakeney's Head.
Q. Is your house a double house?
E. Williams. I have nothing to do with the house but three rooms.
Q. What room did he lie in?
E. Williams. He lay in a one pair of stairs.
Q. Who lay with him?
E. Williams. His wife did.
Q. How many rooms have you on a floor?
E. Williams. There is only one room upon a floor.
Q. Where was he last Saturday fortnight?
E. Williams. He was then at my house, and went down to Rotherhithe; I never heard any body give him a bad character.
Q. Are you sure he lay in your house last Wednesday se'nnight?
E. Williams. Yes, I am sure he did.
Q. Did he lie there last Friday se'nnight?
E. Williams. I cannot tell that.
Peak's defence.
I never saw the evidence in my life, before I saw him at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding

To his character.


                  Thomas 
                  Peak 
               



            . I am Peak's father; I am a breeches-maker, he worked with me; he has certainly got acquainted with some girl that has drawn him away.
Q. When did he work last with you?
Peak. He has not worked with me lately, he worked with a gentleman in Portugal-street, that is not in town; there is a paultry girl he has got acquainted with.
Q. What age is he?
Peak. He was twenty years of age last April; he was born the day Lord Lovat was beheaded.
Mrs. Peak. I am his mother; he has been drawn away by bad company; sometimes he would come home, and sometimes he would go away again; he has often promised very fair.
Cowen's defence.
The evidence says I bought these things in his room, I could as well have bought them in my own room; to be sure these things were found in my room; he was always in my room; he used to put his victuals in my room; he said they were his things, for the child he has in the hospital.

            . I live in Goodman's-fields




; my house was broke open this day se'nnight in the morning; my wife discovered it first, I did not till five o'clock; she called me up, and told me the house was broke open; I found the window was thrown up, the bolt was torn off, the sash was thrown up; we missed a pier-glass, some remnants of baize, some red, some green, and some white, out of the back parlour, and a yellow silk gown from the fore parlour; in the morning, a labouring man was coming past, he asked me if I had lost a pier glass; I said I had; he said, one Mrs. Pilgrim had her house broke open that night, and the watchman had found a pier-glass in Angel-alley, and carried it to the watch-house; I went to the constable of the night, and there I found my glass; he lives by Whitechapel church; this was about six in the morning; I got a search-warrant from the Justice, and went to Mr. Brebrook's house, and desired him to go with me to search a house I suspected; there came a young woman, and said she had stopped this silk gown; I went with her, and stopped the man that brought it, that was Lazarus Abraham; he told us, he only sold it by commission, and was to have but a shilling for selling it, and he would shew us the people he had it from, if we would go along with him; we went with him; he carried us to Cowen's room in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch; there we found the flannel, and took up Cowen and Hyam; I never saw the prisoners till I saw them before Sir

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I fastened the window-shutters over night by the middle bolt; we found it open in the morning, and missed the things mentioned; (the things found produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor's wife.)
Abednego Lambeth. I am a watchman; this day week in the morning we went out, being told these people were about, to see if we could light of them going up Angel alley; we were told, there were some men just gone up there; going up Wingfield-street, we saw an attempt had been made at a house; coming back, I met Peak with a bundle; he got away from me, and went by my brother watchmen, and dropped the bundle; a brother watchman picked it up.
Q. Are you sure it was Peak.
Lambeth. I am; I had seen him often in that part; he had a light-coloured coat on, buttoned close round; had it not been buttoned close, I had held him.
Hyam Jacob. Last Saturday about three in the morning, the bell rang in Cowen's room, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, that joins my room; he bid me get up, and see who was at the door; there was Williams and 
               
                  Jack 
                  Abbot 
               



            ; they came up, and went into Cowen's room; they brought in some white, and some green, and some red flannel, and a silk gown; they left them there and went away, and came again about nine or ten o'clock at night; then there were the two prisoners, and Abbot and Fennil; they made an agreement for the things; Cowen allowed them 26 s. for them all.
Q. Who received the money?
Jacob. Peak received the money, there was a guinea in gold; Peak said he had some silver in his pocket, so he shared the money, and gave every one their share; they had 6 s. 6 d. each; after that, Cowen asked me to sell the silk gown for him; I said I would not; then he asked Lazarus Abraham to go and sell it; he ordered him to get a guinea and a half for it, and told him he should have 2 s. for his trouble. I was there when Mr. Brebrook found the flannel in Cowen's room.

            . These things I found in Cowen's room; Hyam Jacobs told me of Peak and Williams; I took Peak in bed with a woman in Newtoner's-lane.
Peak's defence.
I never had a white coloured coat in my life; I never saw Hyam before I saw him at Justice Fielding's.
For Peak.

            . I am a Jew, I live at Mr. Todd's. The watchman told me one of the men was a Jew in a white coloured coat, a shortish man, and that he had taken him out of bed once in Buckle-street, and that he had a blue apron on. I went and enquired after that person taken out of bed, and found it was not the prisoner Peak, but another person.
Brebrook. We found a blue apron that the bundle was tied up in.
Lambeth. I said I believed he was a Jew, because I had seen him divers times with the Jews.

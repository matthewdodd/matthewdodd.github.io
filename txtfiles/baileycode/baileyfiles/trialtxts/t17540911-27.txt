William Wright. I live in Finch-lane, Cornhill


, the prisoner is my apprentice
, I had often missed money out of my till. On the 25th of July 1 put 23 s. in it, and the next morning there were but 15. As there was no body up but him at the time I missed it, I suspected him, and sent for a constable and charged him with him; then he was searched, and there was found upon him 5 s. 6 d. He confessed he did take it, and that he had paid 2 s. 6 d. of it away, towards paying for a pair of breeches.

            . I am a constable. On the 26th of July I was charged with the prisoner, on suspicion of robbing his master; on searching his pocket we found 5 s. 6 d. and a key that I saw open the drawer, ( he produced the key ) he owned the fact, and that he had paid the rest of the money to a taylor.

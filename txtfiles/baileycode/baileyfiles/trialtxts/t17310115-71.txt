            , of St. Martins in the Fields


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Coat, a Wig, &c.
             of 
               
                  
                     Charles

            , the 21st of December
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prosecutor having stripp'd himself to Fight, afterwards went into a Brandy-Shop, to wash and dress himself, and while he was dressing, the Prisoner snatch'd up the Clothes, handed them out to a Woman, and ran away, but being pursued, was taken.
The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and said, That one 
               
                  Patrick
                   Gill, alias 
Black Patty




            , in Newgate, indicted for another Felony, own'd, that himself committed the Fact, and call'd 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Johnson 
               



             to prove it, who depos'd, That he being a Coachman, was standing near the place, and saw 
               
                  Patrick 
                  Gill 
               



             run along with them, and being call'd by a Fare, set them down at the next Door to the House where Gill had pawn'd them, as Gill told him, he seeing him there; but this extraordinary Evidence, not seeming probable, did not avail him, and the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d
            .

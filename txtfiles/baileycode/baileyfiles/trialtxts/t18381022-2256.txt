LAWRENCE DUFFY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
4th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 



Edwin Tabberer, from his person.






RICHARD JOHNSTON
. I live in Long-lane. On the 4th of October I was in Long-lane—I saw the prisoner go behind the prosecutor—he was with two more boys, about his own size—I saw him take the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and put it under his waistcoat—I ran, caught him, and gave him in charge—he threw the handkerchief under a stall—the policeman picked it up—that was close by where I stopped him—I had got about half-a-dozen yards from the spot where I stopped him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it? A. Yes, I did.





EDWIN TABBERER
. I missed my handkerchief when I was told of it—it was afterwards produced to me, in the presence of the officer—this is it—(looking at it.)





JOHN YATES
, City police-constable. No, 99. I produce the handkerchief, which I got from under the oyster-stall, in the direction in which the prisoner had run—persons had run from the stall with the rest of the people, to secure him—I crossed from the sheep-pens, and took him—several gentlemen said the prisoner had thrown it under the stall.

Prisoner's Defence, I never went near the gentleman—I never had the handkerchief.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Ten Years.

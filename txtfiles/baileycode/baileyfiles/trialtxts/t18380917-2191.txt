 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

WALTER LUCAS
. I am a coach painter, and lodge in Bouverie-street, where the prisoner lodged—I lodged there first—I believe the prisoner is an errand-boy—he slept in the same room with me—on the evening of the 27th of August I missed my property from where I lodge—I was at work in the afternoon, and when I came back it was gone—he slept there that night—I never gave him leave to pawn my clothes—these are the clothe—(looking at them)—there is a pair of trowsers and a jacket—they were in box—it was not locked.





WILLIAM BENHAM TOMLINSON
. I am a pawnbroker. On the morning of the 27th of August, the prisoner pledged the jacket and trowsers for 5s. 6d—in the middle of the day he pledged a coat, and left the trowsers with it, taking the jacket away—in the evening a young man came to make inquiry—on the following morning the prisoner came with the jacket to pledge again, and we stopped him.





RICHARD BARNARD
 (police-constable D 153.) The prisoner was given into my custody—he did not deny the charge.





JOHN HARDY
 (police-sergeant D 16.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried—I was a witness on that indictment.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

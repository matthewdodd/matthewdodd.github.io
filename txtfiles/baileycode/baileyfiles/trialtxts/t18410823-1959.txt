1959. 




JOHN RIGBY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of July, 1 poker, value 3s. 9d.; 1 shovel, value 3s. 9d.; and 1 pair of tongs, value 7s. 6d.; the goods of 



John Cutler; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM POCOCK
 (police-constable F 81.) I was on duty in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, at eight o'clock in the morning of the 23rd of July—the prisoner passed me, and went in front of a couple of shops, near the door, and all of a sudden I saw him walk from the shop, carrying something under his coat—I followed, and took him into custody—as I was following him he dropped the fire-irons from under his coat—when I took him, he said, "I have not taken the fire-irons; they were given me by another person to take care of for an hour or two"—no other person had come near him.





EDWARD ROBINSON
. I am manager to John Cutler, an ironmonger. These irons are his property—they were inside the shop, a considerable distance from the door.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a man the previous evening; he said he could often put me in the way of a job to earn 6d.; he told me to meet him next morning in Queen-street; he said he worked at an ironmonger's; I went, and he gave me these irons; I went on with them as he told me; I heard a cry of "Stop thief;" I looked, and saw the policeman running after me; I dropped the irons, and tried to make my escape.





WILLIAM POUND
 (police-constable S 291.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Ten Years.

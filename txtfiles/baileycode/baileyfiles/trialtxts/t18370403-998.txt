WILLIAM HALL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of March, 1 leather wanty and buckle, value 5s., the goods of 



James Green; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN SMITH
. I am gardener to Mr. James Green. About a quarter before one o'clock, on the 25th of March, I left the cart in the field—when we returned'again at two o'clock, the wanty and buckle were gone—I heard it was at the station—I went to the station-house, and found it and the prisoner.





GEORGE LOWE
 (police-constable T 50.) I found this wanty on the prisoner in Church-street, Hammersmith, about half-past one o'clock—I asked where he got it from—he said, from the harness-maker's across the way there—they said they had not seen him—I took him to the station, and there Smith came and owned it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I wanted some victuals—my father won't let me go in-doors.





JOHN JONES
 (police-constable T 27.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from the clerk of the peace at Clerkenwell (read)—the prisoner is the boy.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Yeas.

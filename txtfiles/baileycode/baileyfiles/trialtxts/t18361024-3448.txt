PETER CASSIDY
 was indicted

for stealing on the 
17th of September, 1 pair of half-boots value 3s., the goods of

Joseph Phillips.






TIMOTHY HURST
. I live in Old King-street Deptford, and am a shoemaker. I had a pair of half-boots in my shop-window on the 17th of September—I saw them safe a little before eight o'clock—they were gone at eight—I had them to repair—I am certain these are them.





GEORGE DORSET
 (police-constable R 94.)I took the prisoner into custody—I found him in Caroline-street—he, (seeing me before I spoke to him) jumped upon some sheds, and I had half an hour's chase before I could get to him—I then took him, and told him he was wanted for stealing a pair of boots—he would not answer me—I took him to the station-house—he had the boots on his feet.

Prisoner. I had no shoes to wear, so I took these.




GUILTY
.* Aged 13—


Transported for Seven Years.

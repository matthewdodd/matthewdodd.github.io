            . I am a journeyman carpenter
, and live in Northumberland-alley, Fenchurch-street



. On the 14th of December I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; and about five weeks after, Mr. Philips, my next door neighbour, was served in the same manner; he got some intelligence of the prisoner, and he found my goods at Mr. Howard's, a pawnbroker. On the 24th of January I got a warrant to go and take my goods, which have been in the constable's hands ever since. I know nothing of my own knowledge against the prisoner; she did work in the same alley where I live: I was a stranger in the place: I had been but six weeks in the place when I was robbed.
Q. What are the people where she lived?
Malens. I do not know.

            . I live with Mr. Howard, a pawnbroker in Houndsditch. On the 14th of December, between three and four in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar pledged three silk gowns and one silk petticoat with me for a guinea in the name of

Q. What way of life is she in?

. She would not confess any thing.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. We were all by my fire-side below while my drawers were stripped above. I missed the clothes mentioned between five and six in the afternoon.
Q. When had you seen them last?
M. Malens. I saw them at about half an hour after three o'clock that day.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am the person that pawned the things to be sure. Mrs. Keys, that lives in Northumberland-court, brought them to me one morning, and desired I would go and pawn them for her. (I did not live with her, but I was acquainted with her). I asked her, if I was to pawn them in her name, or mine; she desired me not to pawn them in her name, because the pawnbrokers knew her; then I said I would pawn them in mine; I did not mind it. I pawned them in my name, and brought the money to her, and she went to market and bought a fine stock of greens.
Mrs. Malens. Mrs. Keys was taken up and brought before the sitting alderman at Guildhall, she had sixteen people of credit to give her a good character, and she was discharged; she is now in court.

                  Key 
               



            . I was ordered to fetch her: I did. She had a good character given her; she was discharged, and the prisoner was committed to Newgate.

Q. How long is it since she lived there?
Weston. It is about half a year since she went away. My master lost a diamond ring, which had been missing two years, when the prisoner found it in a crevice, and delivered it to me. She was always very honest and just.

. On the 18th or 19th of January I mist the things mentioned in the indictment out of my drawers up one pair of stairs in my bed-chamber. I was at a public house at the time; we searched the house, thinking the thief might be in the house, but could find nobody. The next morning I went and searched the pawnbrokers, and I found the two gowns and petticoat at Mr. Bond's, a pawnbroker, in Hounsditch. Then I went to Mr. Howard's, and found that the white sattin and apron were pawned there the day before.

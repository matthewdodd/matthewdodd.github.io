            . I am a baker
, and live in James-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner was in my employ four or five months, and boarded with me - he received money on my account, for bread, and settled his account every evening. On the 11th of December, about three o'clock, he accounted for some money he had received, but paid me none on account of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Talbot
               



            , who is a customer; I asked him, about six o'clock that evening, if Mrs. Talbot had paid him - he said No; he then went out, and locked the stable-door, as usual, but did not come in; he absconded. I found him at his friends', at Leamington, Hants, on the Monday following; he had given me no notice.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  TALBOT
               



            . I deal with Smeeton. On the morning of the 11th of December the prisoner brought the bread - and about five o'clock that afternoon I paid him seven sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 21s. 9d. in silver and copper - he wrote this receipt, in my presence (read.)

            . I am an officer, and received him from the high-constable of Leamington. I found seven sovereigns and a half on him, which he said were part of his master's.

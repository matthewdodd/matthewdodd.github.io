             - he is a watch and clock-maker
, in Old Bond-street



. On the 19th of June the prisoner came to the shop to look at some seals - I took them separately from the window to the counter, to show them to him; he looked at them. and said they were too dear - I missed one of them; I took him by the collar, and taxed him with having taken it - he said I accused him. wrongfully; he then put his hand to his left-hand jacket pocket, and shook out a seal and two brooches - I called the boy, and sent for an officer; he had been in the shop about a quarter of an hour- he said I should not bold him. There was no settlement for any sum of money - he said they were all too dear.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.What time was this? A.About three o'clock - I put eleven seals on the counter; we did not miss any thing else, but he shook the two brooches from his pocket as well as the seal - it was impossible that I could have dropped one in removing them to the counter.
JOHN CROSS. I am errand-boy there. The prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some seals; Mr. Hunt showed him some - he said they were too dear; I saw Hunt collar him - I saw the seal and the two brooches come from his pocket - I went for the constable, who took him.
Cross-examined. Q. The first time you saw them they were on the ground? A. Yes; I took them up, and gave them to Hunt - he denied having taken any thing.
JOSEPH PEARCE. I am an officer, and produce the property.

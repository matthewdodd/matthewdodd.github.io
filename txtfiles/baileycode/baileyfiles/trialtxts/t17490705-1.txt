            . On the 2d of June as I was walking through Cheap-side


 betwixt 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, and three others, came up to me, all dressed in sailors habits, near Queen-street


. One of them came just before me, and stopped me; I do not remember he said any thing to me; the prisoner came on my right-side, and took my handkerchief out of my pocket, I saw him take it, and endeavoured to catch at it, upon which he threw it to another of them, and it fell to the ground. The Man had an oaken stick with a tuck in it, he pointed the tuck to my breast, that I should not take it up; then he took it up on the point of his tuck, and I turned about and took it off the spear. While I was turning about, the prisoner got hold of my watch-chain. He pulled it with such force, that the chain broke at the swivel. I catched it in my hand; he run down Queen-street, the other three run cross the way, I did not observe them how they got off; I cried out stop thief, and run after the prisoner to the bottom of Pancras-lane, and there I laid hold of him. I carried him to the Counter, and the next morning he was brought before Alderman Whitaker, and he committed him to Newgate. The prisoner was never out of my sight till I took him.
Q. How long was this about their stopping you in Cheap-side.
Lee. About a minute, or a minute and half, my Lord.
Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the person that took the chain and the handkerchief out of your pocket?
Lee. I am very certain he is the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Cheapside, the gentleman turned about, and found his handkerchief on the ground; I went by, he called out stop thief, I was taken hold on: before the Alderman he could not swear I took the watch-chain.
Lee. I had no doubt about his taking the chain from my watch; but I intended to be as favourable as I could.




               Guilty of Felony, acquitted of the Robbery

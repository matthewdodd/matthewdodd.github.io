             and another.
Mr. Clarkson conducted the prosecution.
JOSEPH FARMER. I am in partnership with my brother William - we rent a flour-mill
 of Mr. George, in the parish of Enfield


. The prisoner Pluck was employed by Mr. George as watchman
 of his premises - there is only one entrance to the mill, which is by the lodge-gates - it is surrounded by water at all other parts - the prisoner Whitebread was under-gardener
 to Mr. George - on Monday, the 2nd of December, we found the mill had been entered, and two sacks of flour gone, worth 4l. 14s. - we have lost a great deal of property.
ROBERT NICE. I am foreman to Messrs. Farmers. On Saturday, the 30th of November, I left the mill between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I had taken stock that day, as I do every Saturday - the property was all right then - I went again on the Monday morning, about six o'clock, and missed two sacks of flour - on the 11th of December I went with the officer to Mr. George's orchard and garden - I found part of a sack of flour buried in the orchard in a sack, and part buried in a sack in the garden - one sack was Mr. Grattan's, and one Messrs. Farmer's- on the 13th I went again with the officer and examined the granary - I found some flour in a sack buried in some oats - we then went to the coach-house, and found some flour mixed with some lime - we afterwards went to Pluck's garden, and found some flour buried in the garden, and some in a barrel - there was a sack, marked "Grattan," covered over the flour that was buried - it was in consequence of what Whitebread said on his examination, that we went and found the flour in those places - I have some of it here - it belongs to my master I believe.
Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you compared them? A. Yes; flour is very much alike, but there is a difference between best and second flour - my employers sell a great deal in sacks.
- HARTNETT. I am in Mr. George's service - on the day before the prisoners were apprehended I found some chaff in the stable-bin - it was mixed with something white - I cannot say what; I saw Pluck bring it in - I told him he had put something into the oats that looked white - he said he had cut up a mouldy truss of hay.
DR. CRESSWELL. I am a magistrate of this county - I took the examination and confession of the two prisoners - it was made voluntarily, and they were told it would be taken down, I signed it.
JOHN MEAD. I am a constable - I took the prisoners - I found the flour in the garden, the orchard, the coach-house, and other places.
The Prisoner's confessions were here read as follows.
"The said J. Whitebread freely and voluntarily confesses and says, That in the evening of Sunday, the 1st of December instant, between five and seven o'clock, I went into the mill through the bake-house - I went to the first-floor and took one sack of flour; I divided it into two parts: I then took a second sack and divided it in the same way. I put the flour into four sacks, two of which were Messrs. Farmer's. I then removed the four sacks from the mill one by one into Mr. George's stable. On Monday, I heard that the two sacks of flour had been missed. On Tuesday, between three and four in the morning, I and William Pluck, the watchman, removed the flour from Mr. George's stables into his loft. On Wednesday or Thursday morning, between five and six, I and the prisoner Pluck removed the flour from the loft. I carried part of it away and buried it in Mr. George's orchard, and I wheeled another part of it away and buried it in Mr. George's garden; and the remainder of the flour I threw, part of it into the river, and stowed some away in Mr. George's granary; one half-sack I put among some lime in Mr. George's coach-house; William Pluck, the watchman, had the rest."

                  WHITEBREAD
               



            , X his mark."
The said William Pluck says, "I am servant to Mr. George, who lives in South-street, in the parish of Enfield, close to Mr. Farmer's mill, and am employed to watch Mr. George's premises at night. Full fifteen months since, soon after I entered into Mr. George's service, John Whitebread, who lives in South-street, said to me, 'I can put you in a way to get a few shillings as the other watchman and I have done before.' Soon after this he gave me half-a-crown, which I understood to be to induce me to take no notice if I saw him fetch anything out of Mr. Farmer's mill. Between that time and the present I have seen him many times during the night leave Mr. Farmer's mill with sacks, sometimes pig's victuals, part of which he generally gave me, or the money instead of it. About 7 o'clock on the evening of Sunday se'enight I saw him fetch four lots of flour from Mr. Farmer's mill, and put them into Mr. George's stables: on the next morning there was a stir about the flour having been stolen. On the next Tuesday or Wednesday morning, before it was light, I saw 
               
                  John 
                  Whitebread
               



             remove some of the flour from the stable; he told me he was going to throw it into the river: he soon came back and said the flour would not sink. I then saw him remove the remainder of the flour, and take it up Mr. George's back orchard, towards the garden, where he said he would bury it in the ground. When he came to the mill for flour at night, I have sometimes seen along with him Edward Whitebread, Thomas Whitebread, and John Jackson, to whom I have seen him give what he took from the mill for them to take away, and I understand that they were in the habit of buying of him the stolen flour and offal. 
               
                  John 
                  Whitebread
               



             has also told me that Greenwood, who lives next door to his house, at different times has bought pig's victuals of him."

Pluck's Defence (written)."My Lord and Gentlemen,on or about the month of June, 1832, I entered the employ of Augustin George, as private watchman and general labourer; when shortly after it was my misfortune to become acquainted with one 
               
                  John 
                  Whitebread
               



            , of the same employ as myself, but now a prisoner at the suit of the prosecutor, who said he would put me in the way of a few shillings, as was always the rules of the old watchman - being quite ignorant of what these rules were, I said nothing to the information - in a short time after this, I saw the said John Whitebread coming from my master's mill with three sacks - I made some inquiry about it the next morning, and found them to contain grain and flour - I made it my business of seeing him a few days after, when I candidly told him my strong suspicions, stating my being employed as watchman I must certainly acquaint my master, otherwise I should lose my employ - he talked to me on the subject, and said it was always customary with other watchmen, and that if I did not do as others did they would soon get me out of my employ."My Lord and Gentlemen, - Under the idea of losing my situation - I am extremely sorry to say that I did let this robbery continue without giving information, but it was entirely through the dread that I received from the said John Whitebread - I hope under these considerations your lordship and gentlemen will show me mercy, as I have all my lifetime got my living with honesty and sobriety - I have a wife, and seven children under fourteen years of age and entirely depending on me for their support, which I am most willing to do, and in a honest and upright manner - I am extremely sorry to say that my wife and family will be obliged to submit themselves to the parish if I am convicted - I hope your lordship and gentlemen will excuse my way of expressing myself - I hope you will leave it to my future conduct, with the assurance that I was innocently led astray."
Whitebread. That statement is all wrong: I am innocent.

Prisoner's Defence I think it to be about the 22d of June, there was a regiment of soldiers marching through Bow, I was going to the brewhouse at Bow to tell them to bring in a barrel of beer for me; one of the soldiers said he was poor, and wished to sell a shirt, I told him I did not want it, the man followed me to the gate of the brewhouse, and with his saying he was distressed, I said I would give him 5 s. for it; I did not open the shirt to look at it untill I had gone fifteen or sixteen yards, and then I saw a mark on it blotted out with ink; I went to the brewhouse gate to look for the man, he was gone.

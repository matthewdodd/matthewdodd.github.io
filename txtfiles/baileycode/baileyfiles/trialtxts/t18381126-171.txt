GEORGE CHAFFEY
. I am the son of John Chaffey. He keeps a public-house in the Broadway, Westminster—the prisoner was his servant for three months—I suspected and watched her on the 19th of November—I heard her come down stairs, about four o'clock in the morning—she got over the balustrades, went to the lobby, into the bar, to the cupboard and cut some meat; she then went to the engine, and drew brandy, and then to the till, and took out some money-as she was retreating back I stopped her, called my father, and got the policeman—she had got two bottles of brandy, two sixpences, and one fourpence—the money had been marked, and the marked money was found on her—she let herself down from the balustrades with a piece of canvass, and did not make more noise than a cat—I was in the bar-parlour—I found in her box a duplicate of a cloak, which is my mother-in-law's—my father has lost £30 or £40.





JOHN ROBERTS
. I live in York-street, Westminster, and have the cloak—I cannot tell who pawned it—it is in the name of Ann Evans—this is the duplicate I gave—this is the cloak.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

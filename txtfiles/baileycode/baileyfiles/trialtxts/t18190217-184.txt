MISS JULIA ANN M'KEEVER. I live near Rochester. On the 21st of February I was going along Upper Berkeley-street


, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came behind me, put both his hands up, took my shawl off, and ran away with it. I called Stop thief! and he was stopped before he was out of my sight. He dropped the shawl before he was stopped.

            . I am a watchman. My box is at the bottom of Berkeley-street. I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner crossing the street, about twenty yards off - he dropped the shawl. I secured him, and never lost sight of him. The prosecutrix came up immediately.

            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Adam-street, heard the cry, and saw the prisoner running not three yards from the prosecutrix; he dropped the shawl, and I picked it up.

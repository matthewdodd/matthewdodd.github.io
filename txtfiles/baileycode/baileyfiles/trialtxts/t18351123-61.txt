FRANCIS SPICE
. I am a butler, I was in Drury-lane, at twelve o'clock on the 2nd of November—Rowland Hunter told me something, and I saw the two prisoners run away—they were not more than two yards form me at the time—they both went the same road, and were taken by the policeman—I did not see either of them with the handkerchief.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (police-constable F 158.) I was informed of this, and followed the boys—they were running down Parker-street and there Pearson followed them through several streets, into Newport-street, Drury-lane—I threw this handkerchief form his breast on the pavement—I caught him, and some gentlemen took Collins,

Pearson's Defence. I did not throw it down, it was by my side—It fell down there—I never took it.

Collins Defence. I did not touch the handkerchief at all,

PEARSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 13,—


Transported for Seven Years.

COLLINS—


NOT GUILTY

            . I am in the service of Sir ThomasHare. This leather budget, and the articles stated, were all lost on the 9th of March - they were safe, swinging under the foot-board of the carriage, when we were at Waltham-cross


, and when we got to St. James's-street


 they were gone - the strap was cut in two places.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What part of the carriage did you ride on? A. On the box, in front.

            . I took this budget from the prisoner about seven o'clock that evening, at Ball's-pond gate. I asked what he had under his arm; he said a box, which he had brought from the country; that it contained different things, and offered it me to look at; I took him to the toll-house; I found on him this large knife, 5s. 6d. in silver, and 2d. in copper; this knife would not cut the strap; but I afterwards found this razor in a case on him.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not cut it away; the carriage passed me - I had walked thirty-seven miles, and got behind to ride; there were two lads there who got down - I saw this laying in the road, got down, and picked it up; I thought it belonged to the two lads.

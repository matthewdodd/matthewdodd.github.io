JAMES PLUMMER. I am clerk at Stretton's Ale Brewery, Broad-street, Golden-square; the firm is James Goding and 
               
                  Henry 
                  Broadwood
               



            . The prisoner was foreman of a dray
. It was his duty to give me an account of what money he received, and what he had delivered on credit, every evening. I look at his book-all the entries are in his hand-writing; it is the book he takes with him to enter his accounts in. On the 27th of March he brought the book to me-It is my business to copy it into the ledger, and he signed it next morning. There is no account of 12l. 18s. received from Mr. Farr on that day, but Mr. Farr is made a debtor for beer delivered on credit-(looks at the receipt)-this is his hand-writing; he never accounted to me for it.

            . I live in Fleet-street


, and deal with the prosecutors for beer. On the 27th of March I paid the prisoner 12l. 18s., and he gave me the receipt - I paid him in 1l. notes.

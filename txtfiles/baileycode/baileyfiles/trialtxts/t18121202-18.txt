. On Monday evening, November the 2d, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner, accompanied with her daughter, came into the shop to purchase a piece of stuff; they asked for a stuff that the colour was in the window. I took the piece I thought they meant; it was not right. I got another piece; they objected to that, and three or four more afterwards. We have a screen to go round the window to prevent thieving, which I was obliged to throw back, I was obliged to go behind it to get the stuff that was wanted; when I came back again I observed the daughter endeavouring to conceal a piece of stuff under her petticoats, which being so large, she could not accomplish. I took no notice of that; thedaughter complained that she had lost her garter. The daughter then asked for a piece of string that was laying on the counter, and the mother, with a pretence to assist the child to tie up her stocking, took the stuff from the child into her own possession, and placed it between her legs under her petticoats; she then fixed upon one piece of stuff, and ordered me to cut six yards of it, which came to nine shillings. She gave me a three-shilling bank token, and I was to give her one shilling's worth of half-pence. She left two shillings upon it earnest: she was to call at eight o'clock and pay the rest of the money. She was a long while counting the shilling's worth of half-pence. I was holding her the while, she could not walk at all. I suffered her to go to the step of the door, I then called her back, and she instantly dropped the piece of stuff, and the piece of stuff was standing up between her legs when I stopped her, I sent for a constable, and gave charge of her and her daughter. This is the piece of stuff; it is the property of

            , senior's, Defence. I went into the gentlemen's shop. I bought a piece of stuff, I paid two shillings earnest off it; my little girl took up the wrong piece of stuff to what I had bought. I was returning to give it back.
Catherine, Bird junior, was not put on her defence.

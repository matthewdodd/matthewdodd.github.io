            . I am a gentleman. On the 11th of June, about nine o'clock, I was in Fleet-street


, and saw the prisoner close by Mr. Shaw's door, as if watching the motions of the persons inside, I then saw him take a piece of carpetting from inside the door, and put it on his shoulder; I followed him into Red Lion-court, and there collared him, and asked him where he was going with it? he asked if it was mine, and immediately threw it on the arm with which I held him - the weight of it broke my hold, and he ran away. I followed, calling out Stop thief! at last Mr. Jones stopped him at the end of the court, and held him until I came and took him to where the carpet lay. I then took him to the prosecutor with it. I am certain he is the man.

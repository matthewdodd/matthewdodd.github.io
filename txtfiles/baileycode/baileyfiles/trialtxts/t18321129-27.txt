            . I am in the employ of Mr. Simeon Browne, a linendraper
, of No. 199, Holborn


. On the 17th of November the two prisoners came together to the door, about six o'clock in the evening - I was behind the counter, and saw them through the circular panes of glass; I saw Stains draw this piece of print from the inside to the outside of the rail - she motioned to the other to take it off; they then both ran away - I followed, and took them both; Pluce had the print.
Stain's Defence. I had just left work, and saw this on the ground, hanging quite off the rail; he took hold of her first - I asked what she had done, and he took hold of me, and said he would let me know; I had not touched it.
Pluce's Defence. I had been with Stains that night to receive 5s. 6d. for shoe-binding - I was looking into this linendraper's shop; I saw this print on the ground, and thought I had as much right to it as any one.

Christopher Lorain. I am a taylor
, and live at the back of St. Clement's. The prisoner came into my shop on the 2d of October, and took two pieces of silk. I went out, and took her with them upon her (produced in court, and deposed to.)
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Lorain. No. I never saw her before that time to my knowledge.
Q. Did you see her in the shop?
Lorain. No, I did not. My little girl call'd, and said, papa, a woman has carried two rolls of silk out of the shop; so I ran out.
Q. What time of the day was this?
Lorain. Between nine and ten in the morning. She own'd she took them, and beg'd for mercy; saying. she did it through necessity, wanting money to carry her down into Kent to her friends.
Q. What is the value of the silk?
Lorain. It is worth fourteen shillings.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

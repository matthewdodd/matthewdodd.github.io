JOHN DREW. I live in Red Bull-yard, Upper Thames-street. On the afternoon of the 22nd of July I was near the East India-house


, about three o'clock, walking arm in arm with a friend - I felt something like a boy endeavouring to squeeze between me and the wall - I turned round very sharp, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand - I said, "That vagabond has stolen my handkerchief"- he let it fall, and ran away - I took it up, followed him, and saw him drop two others - the first he dropped was mine.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. There were a great many people round me - I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and ran to see what it was - a man knocked me down with a stick - I had no handkerchief about me. Witness. He let my handkerchief fall the moment I said he had it, and ran away, he crossed the road, down St. Mary-axe into Crosby-square - a gentleman knocked him down with his umbrella, or I should have lost him - I saw him throw the two handkerchiefs away, and never lost sight of him.

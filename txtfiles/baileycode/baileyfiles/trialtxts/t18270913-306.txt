THOMAS GOFF. I am a carpenter
. On the 1st of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in the street, and went to her room in Maynard-street, St. Giles'


; I counted my money before I went to bed - I had one half sovereign, two half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences; I put it into my trouser's pocket, which I put under my pillow; I awoke about six o'clock in the morning - she was gone, and the money also - I rapped at the door, which was fastened with a padlock - I could make nobody hear - I got out at the back window, and waited there till about twelve o'clock; she then came home; I followed her up stairs, and accused her of it; she came down, and gathered about one hundred women, who covered me with mud.
Prisoner's Defence. I have known him ten years; he went home with me; he gave me 1s., and I went away.

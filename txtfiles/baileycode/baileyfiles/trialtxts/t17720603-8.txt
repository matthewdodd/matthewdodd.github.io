; the prisoner came to lodge at my house about the 12th of May; he staid about a fortnight, then he went away; the day after he was gone I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I took up the prisoner three or four days afterwards; I found by his own account he had taken the waistcoat and some other articles which he had sold; he told me he had sold the waistcoat to a Mr. Morgan in Monmouth-street; I went to Mr. Morgan's and found it there.
- Morgan deposed that he bought the waistcoat of the prisoner (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner said, in his defence, that he took the waistcoat as his own by mistake.




               Guilty. 10 d.

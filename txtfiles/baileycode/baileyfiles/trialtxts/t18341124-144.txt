JAMES NEWCOMB
. I am a warehouseman. On the 25th of November, I was in Fleet-street, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, walking with John Knowles—I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from his pocket—he offered it to another person, who did not take it, and it fell on the ground—the prisoner ran away—I pursued—and the watchman took him.





JOHN KNOWLES
. This is my handkerchief. I did not feel it taken—but I turned, and saw it on the ground.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

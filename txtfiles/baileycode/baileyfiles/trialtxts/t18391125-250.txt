JAMES HAIRSINE
. I am a policeman. I met the prisoners on the 21st of November, in Old Kent-road, at half-past six o'clock—Chandler appeared bulky—I asked what he had got, and be produced a plane—I asked if he had any thing else, and he produced a square—he said he was a carpenter, looking for work.





HENRY WADE SMITH
. I am a builder. I lost my tools from Graves-end—this plane and square are mine—the shop they were left in was pad-locked.

KENNEDY—


NOT GUILTY

             was again indicted for 


               stealing, on the 9th of August

, 1 watch, value 1l., and 8s., the property of

            . I am a baker
. On the 8th of August I met the prisoner, near twelve o'clock at night, in York-street, Westminster; I cannot say whether she spoke to me or I to her - I went with her to Union-place



; we went up two pair of stairs, I believe; I went to bed, leaving my watch in my fob, and putting my trousers under my head; my money was in my pocket - I awoke at four o'clock; the watch and money were gone, and the prisoner also - I went out, found her, and gave charge of her; I was sober - I had just come from the theatre; she said she had sold the watch for 7s., and I should have it on the Monday night if I would give her 7s.; I had given her 2s. 6d., I believe, for my night's lodging - my watch has not been found since.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of his watch and 8s. in silver; I took her to the watch-house - Simpson found 19s. and some duplicates on her - she said in the afternoon that she had sold the watch for 7s., and if I went wish her she would get it, but I would not.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that on going home to her lodgings she found a man and a woman had broken open her room, and occupied her bed; they ran out and she found the watch on the bed, which she detained, feeling certain it belonged to that man, and not to the prosecutor.

1359. 




ANN HOWELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of April, 1 frock, value 3s., the goods of 




James Woolridge; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






MARY ANN WOOLRIDGE
. I am the wife of James Woolridge, a master builder, and live in Kent-street, Borough. I first knew the prisoner six weeks ago, when she came to char for me—on the 23rd of April I missed a frock and several articles out of my bed-room drawer—she had been at work there that day—I have since found them at the pawnbroker's.





ROSETTA HAWTHORN
. I am married. I recommended the prisoner to Mrs. Woolridge, thinking her an honest woman—hearing of the robbers, I went to the Clink to the prisoner, and got this duplicate from her, which I gave to the officer.





PERCIVAL SMALL
. I am a policeman. I received the duplicate from Hawthorn, and apprehended the prisoner.





WILLIAM FRAAS
. I am shopman to Mr. Rosier, a pawnbroker, in Tooley-street. I produce a frock—I do not know who pawned it—this is the duplicate I gave the person.





JOHN STOREY
. I am an officer of the Borough. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I obtained from Mr. Clark (read)—I was the officer on the trial—the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner. I did it through distress—I was left a widow with two small children.




GUILTY
.* Aged 41.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Coleridge.

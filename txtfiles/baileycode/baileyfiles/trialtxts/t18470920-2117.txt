 forging and uttering an order for the payment of 140l., with intent to defraud 



Thomas Hallifax and other.—2nd COUNT, with intent to defraud 



John Fenton
; and 



WILLIAM ALEXANDER



 as an accessory before and after the fact.


MESSRS. BODKIN
and
PARNELL
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM THOMAS.
 I am a clerk to Messrs. Glyn, Hallifax, and Co., bankers—Mr. Thomas Hallifax is one of the partners—there are five others—the check produced was presented to me for payment on the 19th of June—it is for 140l., purporting to be drawn by John Fenton, in favour of Beresford and Co.—I cashed it in two 50l. Bank of England notes, and 40l. in gold—the numbers of the notes are 90858 and 84837, dated 6th Jan., 1847—I do not think I should know the person again who presented it—I do not think it was either of the prisoners.

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. Did you make the entry yourself? A. I did.





RICHARD JOHN SYKES.
 I am a clerk in the issue department in the

Bank of England—this 50l. note, No. 84837, 6th Jan., 1847, was presented at the bank on the 19th of June last, just as the clock was striking five—it was the last note I cashed—I gave fifty sovereigns for it—the name of John Fenton is on it—it was not written by the person who presented it—he came in very late, and to save time the inspector of notes wrote it.

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. Do you know who presented it? A. It was presented by a boy—I do not know that I have ever seen him since—(the boy Constable was here called in)—to the best of my recollection, it was a buy about his size—I think he had a jacket on at the time.





WILLIAM THOMAS

re-examined. That boy is something like the boy who presented the check to me—I certainly would not swear to him—he was about his age—as to his countenance I cannot say.





JAMES PARSONS MELMOTH.
 I am a clerk to Messrs. Glyn and Co.—the check produced has been taken out of this check-book (looking at one)—the number is 877—that is not a number that runs all through the book—the number preceding is 876, and the last in the book is 878—I find the margin of this particular check left in the book—I issued that book from the banking-house on the 19th of June in consequence of a written order—I destroyed the order—it was very similar to Mr. Fenton's writing—it purported to be an order from Mr. Fenton, and was worded, "Please to deliver to bearer a check-book, and oblige yours, truly, JOHN FENTON."


Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. Are you sure it was destroyed? A. I am quite positive of it—I always was so—I never said I thought I had lost it—I told Mr. Bush I thought I might be able to find the fragments, but I never could—I never said I thought I could find it.

MR. BODKIN.
Q. Did you search for the fragments? A. No.—one of our porters did—I destroyed it at the moment—it was several days after I had destroyed it, and thrown the fragments down, that I directed them to be looked for—a boy very similar to Constable brought it—I cannot swear to him—the same boy afterwards presented the check for payment—it was presented on the same day, within an hour or two afterwards—Mr. Thomas showed me the check, and I said, "Yes, it is all right, it is Mr. Fenton's check; he came from Mr. Fenton's just now;" and the boy said, "No, Mr. Fenton's clerk sent me for it."

COURT.
Q. What time elapsed before the check was presented after the book was obtained? A. About two hours, to the best of my belief—that did not excite my suspicion at all—it was another circumstance that excited Mr. Thomas's suspicion.

MR. EVANS.
Q. Are you quite certain that is the book you issued on that day? A. To the best of my belief—I am certain by the entry—the entry is my writing, and also the number of the check, because I register the numbers as well, and in that book I find all the numbers in the check-book—they commence from 801 to 901—I made the entry on the 19th of June, and my name stands against it.

COURT.
Q. Have you the same number of checks in each book you send out? A. No—in some there are 50, in some 500, in some 5000—it entirely depends on the nature of the account.

MR. EVANS.
Q. How does Mr. Fenton sign his name? A. In the same way that this is signed—I am not a cashier, but I know his handwriting—I should not hesitate in the least in saying that was his—I am not in the habit of paying checks—I know the writing of all the customers—Mr. Thomas applied to me when the check came, and asked my opinion upon it—he said,

"It is all right, is it not?" I said, "Yes, it is all right;" and he paid it upon his own responsibility and mine.





WILLIAM KING
 (policeman, H 83.) I found this check-book in Crispin-street, Spitalfields, in the middle of the carriage-way, about a quarter to two o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of July last—I only saw one person near at the time I picked it up—he was crossing the street—the nearest I saw him was about twelve yards—I could not see who he was exactly.





JOHN FENTON.
 I am a wine-merchant in Mark-lane, in the City. I have an account at Glyn and Co.'s—I know nothing of either of the prisoners—this check is not my hand-writing, and I know nothing about it—it is very like my signature—I think I could detect the difference myself, but it is a very close imitation—I have never seen this check-book before; it is not one of mine—I find my own name on some of the checks—I know nothing about it—this letter (looking at one) reached me by the post; it is signed "Charles Smith"—I do not know any such person—I sent an answer the following day, the 16th of June—I signed the letter "John Fenton," in the same way that I sign checks—I directed the letter to Mr. Smith. (The letter produced was an inquiry respecting a vessel called the "Henrietta," and requested the reply to be forwarded to Charles Smith, 7, Wormwood-street.)

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. Do you know whose writing the check is? A. I do not—I expressed my belief about it at the Mansion-house—it is very similar to the writing of a clerk who was in my employment—that was my opinion—my belief is shaken from circumstances that have happened since.

MR. BODKIN.
Q. There is a similarity in that writing to the writing of a clerk of your? A. Yes—his name is Hubbard—I have seen him here to-day—that similarity induced me at first to suspect him of being the writer of it—my present belief is that he is innocent—my answer to the letter simply stated that I knew nothing of the vessel the writer inquired after.





HENRY HUBBARD.
 I was clerk to Mr. Fenton—I left him on the 22nd of June last, in consequence of this affair.

COURT.
Q. Were you discharged? A. I was taken into custody on suspicion on the 22nd of June—I have not yet returned to the employment—my employer did not direct me to be taken into custody—I believe it was the backers—I have not applied to be taken back, but I expect to return in the course of a few days—I know nothing of the check.





THOMAS CRAFFORD.
 I keep a coffee-house, at No. 7, Wormwood-street, Bishopsgate. I know the prisoner Hayward—I never knew him by any name until he asked me if he might have a letter directed to him at my house in the name of Charles Smith—I am not positive when that was—I think it was the latter end of May, or the beginning of June—it might be somewhere about June—there was a letter came directed to Charles Smith—it was given to him by one of my servants—I saw it given to him—I told her to give it to him.

Cross-examined. Q. In what month was that? A. Either the latter end of May or the beginning of June, I am not certain which—I am not positive it was not in May.

MR. PARNELL.
Q. Did you take in more than one letter at your house directed to him? A. Never, since I have been there.

MR. EVANS.
Q. You are in the habit of taking in letters of this kind, are you not? A. For lodgers that I have staying with me—the number of lodgers I have varies—mine is a large house—I let sixteen beds—I have

occupied the house fourteen months—I have occasionally a good many lodgers, and sometimes only three or four—I never had one of the name of Smith that I know of—I never before had letters directed there to parties who did not reside there—I have had one since, for a gentleman named Dixon, a traveler to Mr. Christy, a grocer in Whitechapel—I am not positive when this was, it might have been the latter end of May, or the beginning of June.

COURT.
Q. Was it late as the end of June? A. No, I am certain of that.





ROBERT KENYON.
 I am clerk to Mr. Patteson, and was so while the prisoner Hayward was in his employment—I cannot swear that this letter is the prisoner's writing.

COURT.
Q. You cannot form a belief upon it? A. I cannot

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. Just look at the check, can you say whose writing that is? A. The figures "19" and "47" are precisely like the prisoner's writing—I cannot say as to the writing—the writing appears to be different—it does not appear to be written by the same hand—I cannot answer as to the figures being ordinary clerk's figures—people make figures differently—I do not think that clerks who are in the habit of writing, make figures very much alike.

COURT.
Q. Have you looked at the figures in the amount? A. Yes, they seem to have been written by the same hand—they are very similar to Hayward's figures—I have my doubts about the writing in the body of the check—it is quite different—I should say the figures were Hayward's writing, and the body of the check not—according to my judgment the body of the check is not his writing, and that leads me to doubt whether the figures are his, although they are very much like his.





WILLIAM BACE.
 I am clerk to Messrs. Bush and Mullens, the solicitors for the prosecution. I served the prisoner Hayward personally on the morning of the 23rd, with a notice, of which this is a copy. (This was a notice to produce the answer of Mr. Fenton.) I also served a copy of it on his attorney. (The letter was not produced.)





JOHN ROWLEY.
 I am employed in the East-India Dock Company's warehouse, in Crutched-friars. I also act in the evening as check-taker at the Pavilion theatre—I know Hayward, and I know Alexander by sight—I remember seeing Hayward on the 21st of June last, at the Mulberry Tree, Stepney-green—there was a publican's ball there, and therefore I know it was on that day—I was there after being at the Pavilion Theatre—I saw Hayward in the ball-room—I was there as one of the company, and he also—we left the ball about half-past twelve o'clock—he wished me to sleep with him that night, and I slept at the coffee-shop—he said he had got a 50l. note, three sovereigns, and some silver about him, and he had a gold watch and chain—he said he had given eighteen guineas for the watch—I had known him before, by coming backwards and forwards to the Pavilion—I did not see the note, I saw the purse—he had the note inside the purse—there was one note, I could not tell whether it was a 50l. note or not—I saw no appearance o a note, but he told me had it—the next morning I went home and got my breakfast, came back, and went with him to Rotherhithe—I dined with him there—he paid for the dinner—he put his purse on the table, and said he had got a 50l. note there and some sovereigns—some time after that, I think on a Saturday morning, about the middle of July. about the 17th, I saw him again, at the corner of the New-road, White chapel—he wished me to go with him to the other end of

the town—I went to the post-office at Charing-cross, at the corner of Trafalgar-square, he there gave me a 50l. note, and asked me if I would be so good as to get 1l. worth of postage stamps for his brother—I said, "Mr. Hayward, what name must I put on the note, your name or mine?"—he said, "You can put any name you think proper"—he told me to put "Spring-gardens" as the address, or some place in the neighbourhood—I do not know whether that is near the post-office or not—I went to the post-office and presented the note, and the gentleman said he could not give me change for a 50l. note, and gave it me back—Hayward was about twenty minutes before he came back—I gave him the note back—I went with him afterwards towards the Bank, towards home, Mile End way—he did not say anything more then—I did not get the change—he said it was of no consequence, he would borrow 2l. or 3l. of Charlie—I told him he could get change at the Bank if he thought proper—I merely looked at the note, and shut it up again—I had no suspicion that it was a bad one—I just gave it to the clerk at the post-office, he looked at it, saw the amount, and gave it me back—he did not object to it as not being a Bank-note, I did not notice anything on the note—I noticed that it was rather a dirtyish note—(looking at one)—this one is not the right note—(looking at another)—I can almost swear that this is the one—I saw some writing that looked like that at the top—I am not a good scholar, and cannot tell what that writing is, but it was like that—I have seen Hayward several times at the theatre—I have known him for the last four months, coming backwards and forwards—this boy, Constable, was the call-boy of the theatre—I have seen him in Hayward's company several times—I have seen Hayward and Alexander together, I should say, about three or four times within the last four months, more frequently within the last six weeks—I never saw them all three together—I have seen Hayward and Constable together, but never Alexander and Constable—I have frequently met Hayward and Constable together, going to have something to drink—I have met them at the top of the Minories, going to have some ale, and I have had a drop of ale with them sometimes—I have seen them very late together.

Cross-examined by
MR. ECANS.
Q. Did you know Hayward before the ball? A. Yes, two or three months before that, he was backwards and forwards at the theatre, passing through into the pit—we did not go together to the ball—I cannot leave till the theatre is nearly over—I happened to meet him at eleven o'clock, and went over to the ball afterwards—we slept together that night—I am married—I left orders that I was not coming home that night, because I know I could not, without keeping my wife up very late—the ball was not over till half-past twelve, then I had to walk all the way to Aldgate—Hayward wished to speak to me, and that made me stop—I dined with him next day—he paid for the dinner—there was nothing at all extraordinary in that—I have often had gentlemen treat me to dinners—I saw his purse laid down, with a note in it, and I likewise noticed a sovereign and some silver—it was a steel purse—it was a 50l. Bank of England note that I presented at the post-office—I could read "50l."—I can read very little—I can put my own name, but I am not scholar enough to read off-hand, or read old English—I gave no evidence at the police-office—I have never been examined publicly before with reference to this transaction—I do not know the name of the clerk at the post-office—I have not seen him here to-day—I merely handed the note in at the box—my mistress was the only person to whom I named this—I might have named it to one or two—I mentioned it to nobody else that I know of, except the police—I mentioned it to them the very same night—I named it to the solicitor; I gave him all the particulars—that was about a week ago.


Cross-examined by
MR. METCALF.
Q. When did you first see Alexander with Hayward? A. About two months ago—I passed them together—I have seen them backwards and forwards for the last six weeks, several times before, and several times afterwards, but not before two months ago.

COURT.
Q. Have you often seen Constable in company with Hayward? A. Yes, very often, about a dozen times or so in the course of the last two months—I did not meet Alexander at the ball.





SUSANNAH LOUISA REEVE HERBERT.
 I am the wife of William Herbert, a tailor—he left this country on the 7th of Aug.—he was here in July—he was then anxious to dispose of a general business which he was carrying on at No. 1, Boswell-court, Devonshire-street. Queen-square—he employed a person named Morley as his agent. The prisoner Alexander came on the 26th of July, and said his name was William Hammond—I heard him say his name was Hammond—he said he came from Mr. Morley, and he came to buy the business—he said he would take it—he was to give 35l. for the business and the shop fixtures—I have a copy of the list of fixtures that we gave to him—he paid the deposit, 8l., out of a 50l. note—this is the note—he was to come again and settle it on Friday, the 30th of July—he gave the note to my husband, and he wrote on it, "Mr. Herbert, Boswell-court, Queen-square"—I did not see him write it, but this is my husband's name, and I believe it to be his writing—I saw it was a 50l. note—my husband had not got change, and he went to Mrs. Cover to get change—he came back with change—I was present all the time he was away—he gave Alexander the full amount—he gave him 45l. in notes, and 5l. in gold, and he gave my husband a 5l. note, and two sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns—Mrs. Cover come over, asked the prisoner for his address, and he gave "William Hammond, 11, Baldwin-street, City-road"—that was at the same time that the change was brought—Mrs. Cover came to see who the person was that had brought the note to my husband, and he gave that address—I saw him give it to her—he never came again—I afterwards saw him in the pit at the Pavilion Theatre—I do not recollect whether Hayward was with him.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALF.
Q. Did you ever see him before he came to inquire about the purchase? A. No, and never since, except on this one occasion at the theatre—he called twice at my shop—the first time he called to look at it, and said he had come from Mr. Morley, and the second time he came to bring the note—I can identify him as the man by his appearance, and he wrote that address, which Mrs. Cover received from him, and she identifies the same man.

COURT.
Q. Look at the prisoner, and say from your own recollection, whether he is the man or not? A. Yes, he is—I recollect his person.

MR. METCALF.
Q. What was the deposit first proposed? A. He said, "I will give you 5l., if that will do"—I said, "Yes, it will do;" and after the change was given he said, "I may as well leave you 8l., I shall have less to pay on Friday;" and he left 8l.—my husband has gone to America—I saw him sail in the ship Quebec, bound for New York—I told the prisoner when he came that we were in contemplation of going; and in consequence of his not purchasing the business, I am left to dispose of it.

MR. BODKIN.
Q. I believe you are waiting here till the trial is over? A. Yes—I shall follow my husband directly I receive his first letter, if he writes for me.





ANN COVER.
 My husband keeps a public-house opposite Mrs. Herbert's I remember Mr. Herbert's coming over with 50l. note for change—my husband was up stairs at the time—he came down directly after, just as Mr. Herbert was taking the change off my counter—in consequence of something

he told me, I went over to Mr. Herbert to make some further inquiry about the note—I found Mrs. Herbert there—Mr. Herbert was not there when I first got there—there was a dark young man talking to Mrs. Herbert, it was Alexander—I am quite positive of him—I did not know his name then—I have heard it since—I went and asked him his address, because my husband said I was wrong in taking the 50l. note—I had the 50l. note in my possession then—Mr. Herbert had the change—I did not see him give it to the prisoner—I saw it lying on the table, and he was there sitting down on the table—I asked him for his address, and he wrote this in my presence as his address (read,) William Hammond, 11 Baldwin-street, City-road"—I left the prisoner there—I saw him again at the Pavilion Theatre with a lot more, the pit was full—Mr. Forrester took me there—I should say that was three weeks or a month afterwards—I had never seen him on any but these two occasions.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALF.
Q. Did you see him write this? A. Yes—I waited while he wrote it—Mr. Herbert had left the pen and ink there—I saw him put his pen to the paper—he said he was a very bad writer—I am positive of that—I am quite satisfied that the prisoner is the man.





THOMAS CAPES.
 I am a saddler, working with my father. I have known the prisoners about five months—I have known Hayward the longest—I have not been much with them—I have seen them together often—I have seen there with Constable several times at the theater, in Whitechapel, and about there—I recollect being with Hayward at the end of June, and having some brandy and water with him—he then said that his grandfather had made him a present of 200l.—he showed me about 70l. at that time, a 50l. note, and the remainder in gold—the money was in a bag, and the note in a purse—he did not talk at that time of what he was going to de in business—he was not then in employment, I do not know whether Alexander was—it was before then that I went with him to the Isle of Wight—I recollect, about three months ago, in the evening, being with Alexander and Hayward, and two others, named East and Penny, in Baker's-row—that was before we went to the Isle of Wight—I have known Forrester, the officer, by sight, for two or three months—I mentioned the name of Forrester to them, it was about a week after we returned from the Isle of Wight—I said, "Have you seen Forrester, the officer, looking about?" Hayward was standing a short distance off, and Alexander was there—they passed it off in a sort of joke, they did not say much—I said it to Alexander and the two young men who were with him, they were coopers—I said, "Have you seen Forrester looking about?"—I had not really seen him—I merely asked them that—upon that, Alexander gave the two gents. a bit of a nudge and a laugh, as much as to say, "Do you say a word," and it was all peace and quietness in consequence—I went away, and left them standing there—I saw Hayward again the same night—he said, "Have you seen Forrester looking about?"—I said, "No, I have not"—he said, "You must have seen him, or you would not have said anything about such a thing," or something like that—he told me he had got into a mess, and he did not know which way to get out of it—he said, "If the question is put to you whether you have seen me with a gold watch or a large sum of money, be sure and say no; say you never saw me with more than a few shillings"—he did not mentioned anybody that was likely to put that question—I said, "Well, perhaps you will have no objection to tell me what this mess is"—he said, "No, I would rather you would ask me for 5l."—Alexander came up at the time, and Hayward told him he would speak to him in a moment—the last words he said, "Be sure you do not say a word, or I shall be lost for ever"—Alexander could

hear that quite well—he was not standing more than two yards off—after they went away together.

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. When was it that Hayward told you he had received 200l. from his grandfather? A. About from the 5th to the 15th of June, or the 16th, or the 20th, I am not certain to a day—I do not know what day of the month it was—we started for the Isle of Wight on the 27th of June, and it was a week before that—I have always made that statement—we were a week at the Isle of Wight—the conversation about Forrester took place about a week after we returned—I had not seen Forrester before I said that—I thought if I could hear anything by saying that, I should—that was all the reason I had for putting the question—if there was anything to be heard, I thought it would be as good a question to put to them as any—I only heard what I have just now stated.

Q. What was this about the nudge? A. As they were all standing together, I came up, and said, "Have you seen Forrester," and Alexander gave a nudge with his elbow and a wink, as much as to say, "Don't say a word"—I think I mentioned the wink before—they did not say a word—it was intended to keep their tongues still, I supposed—the conversation I had with him was not by a nudge or a wink—he told it me in so many words—it was about a week after we returned form the Isle of Wight, about eleven o'clock at night, opposite my father residence—I spent about 5l. on that trip—I received no money from Hayward, and no presents—I did not receive a pair of boots from him as a present—I bought a pair of boots—I swear he did not pay for them—he spent about 12l.—he bought a new coat, two or three riding whips, and also some presents, to send to his young lady, and one thing and another, I do not know what he spent—we spent out riding—we had a horse and chaise for three days—we paid for that between us—it was 10s. a day—I paid 15s.—we lived at different hotels—I do not know what I spent—taking one day with another, I spent about 8s. or 10s. a day—those were my own expenses—we were not all the time in the Isle of Wight—we were away a week, we left London on the Saturday, and returned on the next Monday week—of course we had eatables and drinkables, we could not do without, and a bed—my expenses only came to 8s. or 10s. a day—we travelled by the third-class—he spent more than me, because at the time we were at the hotel be wanted things that I did not care about—I do not know in whose writing this check is—I have seen Hayward write several times, and know his writing—I have seen a check-book in his possession, but not of this nature, not from the same bankers—I cannot swear that this is the one—(looking at the one produced)—the book that was in his possession had two short names, which I mentioned to Mr. Bace, the clerk of Bush and Mullen's, when I first went there—the first names was "John"—I can swear that—I saw that book about the 10th of July.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALF.
Q. Who was the nudge and wink intended for? A. For the two coopers, not for Hayward—he was standing there.

COURT.
Q. When did you see Hayward with a book like that in his possession? A. At the Pavilion Theatre—it was hanging nearly out of his pocket—I took it out, thinking he night lose it, I turned over a leaf or two, and he turned round and snatched it away—that was about the 10th of July, after we returned from the Isle of Wight, I saw the name, I just turned over one or two of the leaves, and I observed there was a signature in the book, the Christian name was John, and the other was a short name—I did not notice the banker's name;—I did not ask him what it was—he did not ask me

for it, he snatched it away from me—he appeared quite offended—he made no observation, but walked out of the theatre soon after—that was after the time of the conversation I spoke of, with a nudge and wink—it was after he told me he had got into a mess—we had not gone to the theatre together, I do not think we ever did, but we have met there occasionally—I saw him occasionally after he said he had got into a mess, we were good friends, nothing had led me to avoid his company, I still associated with him—I never heard that he had a banker—I do not recollect what the name of the banker on the leaves of the check-book was—I was very much surprised to find him in possession of a check-book—I did not make any communication about it, I kept it a quiet as I could, I thought I might find out something more, that was my reason—I first left off keeping it quiet, about a month back—I did not keep it quiet till Hayward was in custody—I stated it between a fortnight and a week before he was taken—I made that communication to Mr. Bush's clerk; having seen a reward advertised in the paper, I went to them, knowing they were gents. that prosecute, and told all I know—the reward did not relate to this prosecution, but to a forgery in the country.

MR. BODKIN.
Q. Did you see that advertisement in a newspaper, or against a wall? A. In a newspaper—I learnt from that that Bush and Mullens were solicitors to the Banker's Association, and I went to their office—when this use was made of Forrester's name, I was in the street, passing the Pavilion Theatre—it was at night—I had not seen Forrester—I had no reason to believe Forrester was looking for him—it was an invention of my own, because I suspected him—I made inquiries about his grandfather of every one I thought was likely to know, they said he had a grandfather, but he was a very poor man.





ISABELLA HAYWARD.
 I am the mother of the prisoner Hayward. At the time this occurred he lived at home with me, at No.4, Hope-place, Stepney—I remember Forrester coming there—I showed him my son's bed-room—there were some drawers, which he opened with a key that he brought—the prisoner has a grandfather living at Scarborough—he has been a ship-builder—he now has a small pension.

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. Where were the drawers? A. In the front parlour—the lower drawer was in my son's possession—he kept books and papers in it—I do not know where his grandfather is at the present time—no inquiry has been made—I have not seen him for some time—I have seen him since my son was taken into custody—the other drawers were locked—his brothers had the key—he has two brothers, both older than him—they live and sleep at home—they all have access to these drawers.

MR. BODKIN.
Q. Do you remember Forrester bringing a key with him? A. Yes—I believe it opened the lower drawer—that was my son's drawer—I was not in the room at the time—the grandfather's pension is about 10l. a year—he has expectations of possessing property—I do not know exactly what the expectations are.





DANIEL FORRESTER.
 I took the prisoner Hayward into custody at the corner of Court-street, Whitechapel—Alexander and the lad Constable were with him—I had had my attention drawn to them for some length of time before that day, more particularly to Hayward—I had seen Alexander—I cannot say he was in his company with Hayward, he was near to him—I had reason to think so, but I cannot say, because I was at a distance off, at the theatre—I have seen Constable in company with Hayward frequently—on taking him into custody I searched him—I found a bunch of keys and these papers on him—I went to his mother's house, and opened the lower

drawer of a chest of drawers in the lower room—it was locked, I opened it with a key which I found on him—I produce some things which I found in that drawer—I found this sheet of blotting-paper—on holding it up to the light the reverse way, I can make out the words "John Fenton"—it is now in the same condition as when I found it—I have compared it with the check said to be forged—it does not correspond with the impression on that blotting paper—I believe they are not the same—it is not impression of the forged one—I have not compared it with all the checks—I took Alexander in to cus-tody at the same time I took Hayward—there was another officer with me—I took hold of both their arms, and popped them both into a cab as soon as I could—Hayward asked me what I took him for, and I told him he was charged with uttering a forged check on Jones, Loyd, and Co., for 89l. odd, about the middle of March, or something to that effect—he made no reply—I said nothing more at that time—he asked me a question or two, to which I did not give him any answer—I think he asked me what the other officer's name was, or something of that sort—I did not tell Alexander at that time what he was charged with—at the Mansion-house I told him he was charged with passing a 50l. note in taking a shop in New North-street, Queen-square, of a person named Herbert—he said he knew nothing about it, he had never had a 50l. note—I received this address, "W. Hammond, No. 11, Baldwin-street, City-road"—I made inquiries at the place, and found no such person known there.

Cross-examined by
MR. EVANS.
Q. The papers you handed to me are what you found in the drawer? A. No—on the prisoner, Hayward's person, among the rest, I found a 50l. note of the Bank of Elegance—I found these papers and letters on his person—I took the key from him—I took him into custody in Whitechapel-road.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALF.
Q. What did you find on Alexander? A. Nothing that I kept from him—I do not think he had much on him—I searched his lodging, and brought away two duplicates, that was all—they had nothing to do this case.





ANN COVER

re-examined. I should know the 50l. note again, by my husband's writing—I saw him write on it, and likewise Mr. Herbert at my bar—this is it (looking at it)—my husband's initials, "J. C.," are under Mr. Herbert's name—he wrote Mr. Herbert's name as well in the corner.





JOHN ROWLEY

re-examined. I recognize the note by black ink-mark—(looking at one)—this is not the note (looking at another) this is the note with the writing at the top.
Francis Hayward, (the prisoner's father,) No. 4, Hope-place, Stepney; and William Hughes, of No. 1, William-street, Commercial-road, gave the prisoner Hayward a good character: Alexander also received a good character.

HAYWARD—


GUILTY. Aged 19.—


Transported for life.


ALEXANDER—


NOT GUILTY.

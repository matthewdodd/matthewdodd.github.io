FRANCES GRIFFITHS
. I am a widow, and live in William-street, Lisson-grove. On the 19th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in my own room, which is the back kitchen, and heard somebody—I looked, and saw the prisoner going to the front kitchen—I thought she was going to Mrs. Sanders in the front kitchen, but I did not

hear any one knock—I went out again, and saw her going up stairs, with the things off the line—she had them in her hand before her, rolling them up—I called to Mrs. Sanders, and to my landlady, who was in the yard washing—I took hold of the prisoner, and she dropped the things—this is the property—it is two shirts and a gown—it was given to the police-officer.





ANN SANDERS
. I am the wife of Henry Sanders. I lodge in the front kitchen—I was at home—the property was taken from a line in the passage—I do not know the prisoner, she is quite a stranger to me—the street door was open.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to inquire for a person, and these things were on the stairs—this person came and asked me what I wanted—I said "Nothing"—these things were in the corner, and then she called the policeman.

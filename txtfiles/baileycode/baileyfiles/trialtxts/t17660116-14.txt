            . I keep a publick-house
 in Charter-house-lane


: the prisoner and Ibbot the evidence used my house. They were there on the 23d of Dec. and went away together between 12 and 1 at night, and when I got up in the morning between six and seven, I found a pane of glass taken out in the back window, and the shutter which was on the inside and the casement were open, and the bar in the middle of the window was cut. I went to the prisoner and evidence's lodgings, and found they had not been at home all night; then I suspected them.
Q. Did they both lodge together?
David. No, they did not. I got a constable, and he and my brother-in-law and I went to where the prisoner lodged: we met him coming to the door, we took and carried him to Bridewell. Then we went to the evidence's lodging, we were informed he used the Globe on Saffron-hill, we went and met him coming out of the house, and took him to New Prison, and on the morrow he confessed he and the prisoner broke my house and stole the things. His father desired me to take him to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             and get him admitted evidence; we took him there, and he was admitted. He took us to the pawnbrokers where we found the things, one pawned in Holborn, another in the Fleet-market, another on Ludgate-hill, another in Field-lane. The prisoner was taken before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , there I heard him own to the taking the things.

            . I and the prisoner left the prosecutor's house between 12 and 1 the night before Christmas-eve; we went through a back alley where we saw the door to the yard open, we went in, the prisoner took a knife from his pocket and took out two panes of glass and got to the bolt of the window, he bid me lift up the shutter while he put his hand under and moved the bar; he got the bar up and shoved the window open, then the shutter tumbled on the table; then I helped him in at the window, by lifting him by one of his legs, he got in, and brought out those stewpans and saucepans, and we went and pawned them.

            . I am the constable: I heard the prisoner confess he, in company with the evidence, took the things before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding

            . I have known the prisoner 12 years, I am a porter to waggons, I have trusted him with hundreds of pounds worth of goods, he behaved very honest, I never lost any thing by him.

            . I am a porter at an inn, he has worked with me, I have trusted him with 40 or 50 pounds worth of goods at a time, I don't know that he ever wronged me of a halfpenny.

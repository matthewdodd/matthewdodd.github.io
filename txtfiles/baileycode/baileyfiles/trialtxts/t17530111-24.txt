                  John 
                  Pixley 
               



            . On the second of this month I was coming from George's-Fields and through St. James's park


, and had about 18 l. in my side-pocket; in the park I met the two prisoners, who said to me, good night; I said, a good night; Lumley came to me and said, my dear, my soul, and immediately snatched my watch from my fob ; I said, you have got the wrong man, and took hold of her; she called the other prisoner, who came and took the watch from her hand and made off under the rails; I bound Lumley, and said, if you'll step forward I'll catch her and get my watch again. I took her up and put her over the rails; the first was very impudent, and the other much worse ; I could not get Lumley to go fast enough, and the other got off with the watch.
Q. Had you said any thing to Lumley before she took it?
Pixley. No, I had not said a word, it was done in an instant.


                  Thomas 
                  Newton 
               



            . 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Thompson 
               



             brought the watch to me in the evening of the same day, and told me it was her husband's, and took out a gown which was pawned before for 8 s.
Q. What did you lend her on the watch ?
Newton. I lent her a guinea and half on it. The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor, name, More, Ipswich



                  John 
                  Morgan 
               



            . 
               
                  Anne 
                  Lumley 
               



             lodged at my house in Westminster, it was her usual way to go out in the dusk of the evenings and return about nine or ten o'clock; she sent for me on the third of Jan. in the morning to Whitehall lodge being in custody, and told me she and the other prisoner had robbed a gentleman of a watch in the park, and desired me to go to her at a butcher's shop in King-street, so I ran as fast as I could, and was there informed that she was just gone down stairs with a man that had lain with her all night; I went and found her, and had her before justice Ledrand ; she wanted to be admitted an evidence in this robbery, and said she had been concerned in divers robberies about Westminster with Lumley. She there owned she had pawned the watch for a guinea and half to this Mr. Newton, and that she thought at first 
               
                  Anne 
                  Lumley 
               



             had put a snuff-box in her hand; that then she ran away with it.
Thompson. All that Morgan has said is as false as to say I am now standing on the top of St. Paul's church.
Lumley's Defence.
My husband was killed in a battle abroad where this gentleman was, I knew him there, he was an officer's servant, I met him about six o'clock in the park, and he called me to him, saying, come and oblige me, my dear, and I'll do you a favour; he said he knew me very well; I told him I lived at the Green Canister in St. Martin's-lane, and that I was not a common person in that way, but was reduced very much, and a little money would be of service to me, but I would not take any body home; he said, I'll give you a crown to morrow if you'll be agreeable, as we know each other, but I would not, so went away; then he called to me again, and said he would leave his watch with me, and be back again in about eight days time, so I obliged him, and after that he wanted his watch again; he came to me after that and said, what, are you going to pawn my watch? I said, you are dishonourable to make use of my body, and then to want it again without the money, this other woman heard him, I gave it her to secure it, so he took hold on me like a little bundle, and jumped me over the rail, and confined me. I sent a letter, to Mrs. Thompson to bring me the watch again, for the gentleman; after this he promised to give me half a guines, but instead of that he put me into a dark hole.
Thompson's Defence.
I was not there, but was in my own room all the night. 
               
                  Anne 
                  Lumley 
               



             sent me with it to pawn, so I carried it.
Q to the prosecutor. Have you been abroad ?
Prosecutor. I have been in Flanders, but not the time as she mentioned; she said before the justice her husband was killed at the battle of Dettingen, I was not there, but have been at battles as a servant, and was always a volunteer.
Q. Did you know 
               
                  Anne 
                  Lumley 
               



             abroad?
Prosecutor. No, I did not,

            . I have known Thompson five months, she is a very good neighbour, and an honest woman.

            . I live in the same house where Thompson lived, and never saw any thing of her but what was just and honest.

                  Swindham 
               



            . Thompson lodged at my house about six months, and is a very quiet inoffensive woman, I never knew any harm of her.
Both 


               guilty of stealing , but not privately from his person
            .

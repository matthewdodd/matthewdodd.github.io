            . I left my watch in my bed chamber on Monday morning, the 7th of November, and missed it about an hour after. I took up the prisoner on suspicion, and before the justice he own'd he had taken and pawn'd it at one Mr. Coy's, where I went and found it.
Q. What are you?
Hurd. I am a hostler out of place; the prisoner and I lodged both in one house.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Coy, a pawnbroker, in Leather-Lane. The prisoner pawn'd this watch to me. (Producing one, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I heard the prisoner own he had taken this watch, and pawned it in Leather-Lane.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have had the misfortune to lose my arm, and am destitute of friends; I never did such a thing before, and hope you will pardon me.

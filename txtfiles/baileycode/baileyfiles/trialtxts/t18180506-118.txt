            . I was coming out of the kitchen about twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner come out of the servant's hall - He asked if Jones lived there? I told him No - He came down the area; I saw the coat lying at his feet. I took hold of him, thinking he might have some plate, and called Hilson. The prisoner pulled me up several of the area steps, trying to get away - I still held him. A crowd gathered round. He returned to the hall, and the butler and footman secured him.

            . I am an officer in the army
. On the 17th of April I was going from Wimpole-street to Oxford-street


, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I missed my pocket-handkerchief from my pocket when I got to Oxford-street - it was a new one; I had not seen the prisoner.

            . I was in Wimpole-street on duty; a gentleman's servant called to me, and said, "These two men have taken a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket"- I went and took the prisoner, who Killick said had received it from the other; the prisoner took the handkerchief from his pocket, and attempted to throw it down an area; I caught it, and took him - this is it.

            . I saw the prisoner and another in Wimpole-street; I saw the other take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - the prisoner received it; they were both close to him.

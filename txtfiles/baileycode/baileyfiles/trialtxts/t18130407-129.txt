            . I am a tailor
. I lost my watch on the 4th of April, in Hale-street, Poplar


; it was a little after twelve at night. I went up to the side of the wall to make water; I stood there, the prisoner came to me; she was with me two or three minutes; I gave her a shilling to get rid of her, and while I was buttoning up the flap of my breeches, I missed my watch. I directly said, you have got my watch. She denied it. I called to the watchman; he came up, and took her to the watchhouse. The officer found the watch in her bosom.
- GREGORY. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found the watch in her bosom. This is the watch.
Prosecutor. It is my watch.
Prisoner's Defence. I am a girl of the town. He dropped his watch; I picked it up.

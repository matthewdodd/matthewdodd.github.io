WILLIAM STEVENS



was indicated for stealing 1 shovel, value 2s. the goods of 



William Woodman; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM WOODMAN.
 I live at Uxbridge, and am a labourer. On the 9th of Dec. I was at work for Mr. Atwell—in the evening of that day I left my shovel on the premises—I went the next morning—the door was broken open, and the shovel gone—the prisoner was not at work on that ground, but in the next garden—there was only a wall between them—the prisoner had been at work on those premises—this is my shovel—I broke it down as it is now myself.





JOSEPH GURDLER.
 I am a labourer, and live at Uxbridge. The prisoner lodged at my house for about ten weeks—about a month ago he brought a shovel home, and told me he bought it of his master—I afterwards heard he had stolen the shovel, I gave it up to the policeman—this is it.






STEPHEN MASTERS
 (police-constable T 150.) I met Gurdler and talked about the shovel, in consequence of which he went and brought this shove,

Prisoner's Defence. I can say I never stole the shovel; no one can say I aid.

COURT
to
WILLIAM WOODMAN.
Q. Did you ever lend the prisoner the shovel? A. No—he had one of his own—he was not in the habit of taking my shovel without asking me—he had no right to it at all—I wanted it myself the next day.





RISHARD ROADNIGHT
 (police-sergeant T 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this court—(read—Convicted the 10th of June, 1844, and confined six months)—I was present—the prisoner is the Person—he has been since tried at Clerkenwell.




GUILTY. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

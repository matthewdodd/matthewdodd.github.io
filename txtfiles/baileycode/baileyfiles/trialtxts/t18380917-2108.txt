SARAH CORP
. I live in Aldersgate-street, and am a widow I keep jeweller's-shop. On Saturday, the 8th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked for some gold rings—I gave her one—it was too large—I gave her a second, and that was the size, but instead of returning it to me she gave me a brass one worth nothing—I am sure the one I gave her was a gold one—I acrossed her of it—she denied it—I sent for the watchman and searched her—he found nothing on her but one farthing, but as she was putting her clothes on, my servant found the ring between her fingers—that was the ring had given her—it is mine.





ELIZABETH SNODING
. I am servant to the prosecutrix. I was stading by, and saw the ring between the prisoner's fingers—I said "There it is"—I took it from her and gave it to my mistress.

Prisoner. I was very much in liquor. Witness. No, she was very sober.

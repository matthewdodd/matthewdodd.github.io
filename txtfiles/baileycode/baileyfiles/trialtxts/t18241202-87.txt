                  , from his person
            .
DAVID FARROW. On the 5th of November, I was passing Blackfriars-bridge


, about eleven o'clock in the morning. I had a silk handkerchief in my pocket. I felt something behind me. I put my hand to my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone. I turned, and saw it on the ground, and the prisoner near me. I made a catch at his collar, but missed him - he then crossed over, but was brought back again in two or three minutes - he was out of my sight for a short time; but I had such a view of him, that I could not be mistaken in his person.

            . I am a tailor. I was on Blackfriars-bridge, and saw the prosecutor coming towards me. I saw the prisoner make a sudden move, and saw a silk handkerchief in his right hand - the wind blew it up, and I saw it distinctly - he put it behind him to another person, but they saw I noticed them, and dropped it on the ground. I said to the gentleman, "Have you not been robbed; this chap has just picked your pocket?" the prisoner then crossed the road, and seemed not to know which way to go - he then ran off, was pursued, and brought back again.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody.

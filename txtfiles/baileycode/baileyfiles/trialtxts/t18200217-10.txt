            , who is a linen-draper
. On the 8th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening, Morgan called me, pointed the prisoner out, and said he had taken some handkerchiefs out of the window. I collared him, and as I brought him back he dropped them, and Morgan picked them up. I gave him in charge.

            . I saw the prisoner walk by, put his hand into the window, and take the handkerchiefs out. I went and told the shopman, and then saw him drop them. I picked them up, and gave them to the shopman.

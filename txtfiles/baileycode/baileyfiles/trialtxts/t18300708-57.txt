            . I lost a coat, a handkerchief, and a pair of gloves, from the Cape of Good Hope, public-house, in Devonshire-mews


; they were on the settle by my side, in the tap-room - the prisoner and two women came in, and stopped half an hour; as soon as they were all gone I missed the things - these are them.

            . I am an officer. I produce these articles, which I got from the prosecutor; he had the prisoner, and charged her with taking them - she begged to be forgiven, but said she did not take them away.
THOMAS JORDAN. I followed her, and overtook her in Devonshire-street - the wind blew her cloak aside, and I saw the coat; I took her back - the handkerchief and gloves were in the pocket.
Prisoner. I was very much distressed, and these women said they would give me something to eat - this coat laid in the yard, and I put it on to defend myself from the rain; I had no cloak on.

            . Yes, she had the coat on, and the cloak over it.

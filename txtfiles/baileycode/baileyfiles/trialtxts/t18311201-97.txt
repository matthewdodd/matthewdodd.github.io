            . I am a special-constable. On the 24th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Soho-square


; I saw the prisoner behind a carriage close against the rails - he went to the dickey, and took this coat off, he hung it across his arm, and I went up to him; he dropped the coat - I pursued, and took him in the next street.

            . This coat is mine; I was at that time in the service of Mr. Stodhart, and this coat was on the dickey of his carriage.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through the square, and saw a man cutting the trees; I saw a man run, the constable cried "Stop thief!" I ran, and he took me - I never had the coat at all.

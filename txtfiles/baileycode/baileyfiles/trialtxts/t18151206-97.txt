            . I let a bed to the prisoner at three shillings a week; he came on the 5th of December, and quitted on the 6th, and took with him a sheet. There was a counterpane and two razors gone in the same room, but they were not let to him by contract. We went after him, and secured him, and took him to Jones, the constable.

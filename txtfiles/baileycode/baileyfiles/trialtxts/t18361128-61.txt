GEORGE PARSONS
. I live in Queen-street, Cheapside. On the 6th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Grace-church-street—a person tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I had not lost my handkerchief—I felt my pocket, and said I had—he pointed to two persons, and said, "You seize one, and I will seize the other"—I seized the prisoner—the other immediately ran away—the person ran after him, and as he pursued him along the street, I saw him throw the handkerchief, away—I took the prisoner to where the handkerchief lay, and held him there till the person came back, when the handkerchief was found—I was not conscious of it being taken form me.





JAMES WILD
 (police-constable R 141.) I was in Grace-church-street, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and another young man follow the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the other—I told the prosecutor—he caught hold of the prisoner, the other one got a little a-head of me, and ran away—he threw the handkerchief among some bricks.
(Properly produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came behind me, and touched me on my back—I turned round, and asked what he wanted—he said, "Stop a few minutes"—I stopped till Wild came and brought the handkerchief to him, they took me to the station-house, but found no property on me—I was on the opposite side of the way when the prosecutor came to me.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

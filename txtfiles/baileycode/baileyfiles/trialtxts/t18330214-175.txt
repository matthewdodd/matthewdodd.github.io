            . I deal with the prosecutor for bread. On the 4th of February I paid the prisoner a sovereign for a board of bread, which he brought at that time, and one which he had brought before - he gave me this receipt.
MR. HUCKER. He did not give me either of these sums on the 30th of January - he returned his account not so well as usual, and on the 4th of February he went away entirely, carrying the money, board and all- I could have brought half a score of other persons who have paid him money.

               for Seven Years

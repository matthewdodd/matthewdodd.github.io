             . About 4 Months ago, the Prisoner and I broke open Mr Lane's Garden Gate, at Hackney, between 11 and 12 at Night, and we both got into the Garden: then he lifted me up on the Top of an Arbour joining to the House, and I got out 2 Pins belonging to the Window-Shutter, and the Shutter fell down: then I try'd to get into the House, but I could not get thro' the Window; upon which the Prisoner bid me come down, and pull my Cloaths off; which I did, and then got in and open'd the Back-door, and then let him in. We took away 2 Quilts, a large Copper, 2 Curtains, 2 Blankets, and 3 Saucepans, which we ty'd up, and carry'd off in 2 Loads (between us) to the Prisoner's House. The Copper we sold to one Birch , a Smith; the other Things we shar'd between us: there were several other Goods taken, which I have not mentioned.
Mr. Lane. I have a House at Hackney, which is lock'd up when we are in Town. The beginning of November the Garden-Door, which we left locked, was broke upon; a Window-Shutter one pair of Stairs, and a Sash-Window, were broke, and the Things mentioned in the Indictment were taken away. The Gardiner, who looks after the House, brought me Word the next Day, that my House had been broke open and-robbed, and these 2 Pictures, which have been in my Family these 100 Years, were sent to me, by the Evidence Lipscomb.
Lipscomb. I know the Pictures very well: one of them is cracked in the Frame. I took them off the Chimney when we robbed the House. Some of the Goods we sold; and some of them the Prisoner has now got at home. The Copper and the Saucepans we sold together, but the Persons who bought them are run away.
Mr. Lane. The Persons who bought the Goods are gone off.
Prisoner. When was this Robbery committed?
Mr. Lane. I think it was the 3d of November.
Prisoner. I was at home and a-bed at that Time; but I very seldom call People to see me a-bed, so I have no Witnesses to that: but I am a Bricklayer; a hard-working Man. and an honest Man; and I work'd for Mr Dussield in Shoreditch, till he dy'd.

               receiving a Coral, mounted with Silver, knowing them to be stole
            .
Joseph Crane. I live at Bow





, and my House was broke open on the 30th of December, between 10 at Night and 7 in the Morning. The Parlour-Window was broke, and 2 Bolts wrenched off, with which (I am sure) the Window was made fast at 10 o'Clock at Night. I found it broke about 7 in the Morning, and the Sash stood up. All the Goods mentioned in the Indictment were taken away, and were my Property, except the 8 Yards of Cloth, which was my Brother's. The Breeches and the Shoes were in the Entry, and all the rest of the Things were in the Parlour. The Tea-kettle I remember to have seen at 10 o'Clock at Night. - It was break of Day when I got up in the Morning, and was light enough to distinguish one Man's Face from another's. I advertised the Goods immediately, and the Monday following one Mr Bowler came and told me, he believ'd his Son had bought the Fender and the Tea-kettle of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Birch 
               



            . I went down to Bowler's, and swore they were mine: then we went to see after Birch in Bluecoat-fields , but not finding him, I was advised to lie still for some Time, But about three Weeks afterwards, we found a Piece of the green Cloth pawn'd at Mrs Dodgings , in Bluecoat-fields : we took her before a Justice, and she informing us, that the Cloth was pawned to her by the Evidence's (Lipscomb's) Wife, we got a Warrant for her, and took her: she was committed to Prison, and the Prisoner was taken as he was carrying Victuals to her in Goal, and this Gun screw, which I swear is mine, was found in his Pocket.

                  Gill 
               



             . I searched the Prisoner, and found this Knife, and that Gun-screw in his Pocket, which Mr Crane has sworn to. The Prisoner told us he found it in Lipscomb's Nail-box, when he came to help him move his Goods.
Philip Lipscomb. Wicks, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Birch 
               



            , and I broke open Mr Crane's House, the 29th or 30th of December, - the Sunday-Night after Christmas Day, - between 12 and 1 o'Clock. We took Wick's Lathing-Hammer, which he carried out in his Apron, and wrenched open a Window-shutter, which had 2 Bolts upon it. 'Twas a Parlour Window next the Street-door, going into the Yard. Then Wicks lifted up the Sash, and took out a Pewter-Plate which stood within his Reach: after which, he lifted me in at the Window, and I handed out a Tea-kettle, a brass Fender, a silver Coral engraved, a large silver Spoon, with a Scallop-Shell upon the Heel of it. A silver Tea-Spoon, 7 pieces of pickled Pork in a Pan, a pair of Stockings, and a China Saucer. These Things I found in the Parlour. The Breeches hung upon the Bannisters of the Stairs, in the Passage, and the Shoes were under the Stairs. Among the things we carried away, there was a Gun-screw, with a bit broke off from the sharp End of it. - This is the same. The Tea-Kettle we let fall, as we were carrying the Goods away upon our Backs, and it being bruised, Birch beat it out upon his Anvil, and then carried out that and the Fender, and sold them for a Crown, as he told us. Mrs Birch pawned the Spoon for a Crown and brought us the Money, and we had Twenty-pence a-piece. The Pork was divided among us; we had 2 Pieces each, and the odd Piece we eat among us. The Cloth was likewise shared, and each of us had a Piece. The Prisoner Love bought the Coral for 8 s. and a Quartern of Brandy. Wicks and I have been acquainted 7 or 8 Years; he worked with the Master to whom I served my Time: and I have known Love about the same Time, he sells a Dram at St Giles's, but I believe he knew nothing of my Life and Conversation. I was speaking to my Sister about the Coral, and she told me Mr Love would buy it of me. Accordingly I offere it to him; he asked me if it was safe? and I told him yes, and that I did not care to offer it to a Silversmith for fear he should doubt me. All the Money we sold the Goods for, was divided etween Wicks,

                  Birch 
               



             , and myself.
Wicks. Where did you lie, that Night this Robbery was committed?

Lipscomb. At Mr. Birch's House. She called me up, to go out upon this Account with her Husband; then we knocked Wicks up, and went and committed this Fact. I lay that Night, in the same Room with Birch and her Husband; she knew what I was, and used to let us bring in Goods, at all Hours of the Night.
Love. Did not your Sister bring the Coral to me?
Lipscomb. My Sister shewed him the Coral, but she told him 'twas mine, and I was in the Room at the same Time. 'Twas in a Room he calls his Kitchen, and he was a-bed when it was offered him. He ordered me a dram of Gin, and asked me what I would have for it? I asked 12 s. for it, then I came down to 10 s. 6 d. and at last to 8 s. which he consented to give me, and a Quartern of Brandy. I had not seen Love for 5 or 6 Years before my Sister carried me to him with the Coral. As to Wicks he wanted to be made an Evidence, and went with that intent before Mr Justice Priestly, but the Justice would not admit him.

                  Crane 
               



            . By the Direction of Wicks I found 3 Yards of my Cloth at one Mr Colebecks , in Whitecross-Street, in the Park, Southwark. Another Piece I found at Mrs Dodgings, - about a Yard and a half, which was pawned to her for a Shilling. Another was made into a Petticoat, which we took off Lipscomb's Wife's Backside, in New-Prison: and by her Direction we found this large silver Spoon, at one Mr Holmes's a Pawnbroker in Ratclisse-Highway , where Mrs Birch had pledged it for 6 Shillings.

                  Colebeck 
               



            . The Prisoner Wicks brought me this Piece of green Cloth, and as he had lived 6 or 7 Years in the Neighbourhood, I thought him an honest Man, and lent him 2 s. upon it.

            . The Prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Birch 
               



             brought this Spoon to me, and told me it was her own, so I took it in, and lent her the Money on it.
Wicks. I was not concerned in this Robbery; Lipscomb told me he did it alone and by himself; and that he had made a good Jobb of it. I had nothing to do with any of the Goods; I only eat a bit of the Pork, which Lipscomb broiled upon the Tongs.
Colebeck. I have known Wicks a great while, and heard no harm of him.
Love. I knew nothing of the Coral's being stole; nor did I know he was a Thief. I have been married to his Mother these seven Years, and have bought him Cloaths a great many Times.
Mr Crane. The Coral cost me 29 s. I believe 'tis now worth 20 s. and he bought it for 8 s.
Love. It broke in my Pocket, and the Coral came out: so I sent the Silver out yesterday to be sold, and had no more than 6 s. 6 d. for it.




               Wicks acquitted of the Burglary, but Guilty of the Felony
            . Birch and Love 

               acquitted
            .

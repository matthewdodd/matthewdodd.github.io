THOMAS BENNETT
. I am assistant to Abraham Shaw, of High-street, Whitechapel. On the 9th of April, we had a pile of printed cottons in the lobby chained to a pillar—I saw them safe about ten minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, and missed them about half-past—these now produced are them—they have the private and selling marks on them.





CORNELIUS FOAY
 (police-constable H 98.) Between seven and eight o'clock on the 9th of April, I met the prisoner in High-street, Whitechapel, carrying this bundle of prints under his arm.

Prisoner. I told him when he stopped me that a respectable looking man, who got out of a cab, asked me to carry them for him.

Witness. No, he did not—he said he brought them from Thames-street.

Prisoner. The man kept with me all along Whitechapel till the officer stopped me; I did not see him then.




GUILTY
.** Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

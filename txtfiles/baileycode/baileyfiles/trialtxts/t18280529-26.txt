 - I occupy the first and second floors, and pay my rent to the landlord, who lives below. The prisoner worked with me at this house- he had not left my employ, but was only waiting till more work came in. On the 7th of May I went out in the morning - I locked the door of the bed-room where this property was, and put the key in the other room, where my wife was; when I returned I found the key where I had left it, but the door was unlocked, and the property gone; I went with the officer about four o'clock in the afternoon, and apprehended the prisoner playing in a skittle ground - my trousers were found in his hat.

            . I am a constable. I saw twenty or thirty thieves with the prisoner. I saw him follow a gentleman in the crowd, pull his handkerchief out, and put it into his bosom. I lost the gentleman in the crowd, there was so many of them, that it was difficult to get the prisoner out. He said he picked it up; that was impossible, he could not pick it up in the crowd.
Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief was thrown on my arm, two or three people wished to take it off - I did take it off.

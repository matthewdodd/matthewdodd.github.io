JOHN SHAW. I am a constable. On the 14th of July, I was going up the Minories, about twelve o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner; I followed him. He examined several shops, and tried to take several things from the doors; he had an apron on. I followed him all along Whitechapel to Mr. Harris's shop, and saw him pull the cotton from the door; after loosening it, he folded it up, and let it fall into his apron. I secured him, and asked him what he had got, he said, something for his wife, and begged of me to let him go - I took him back to the shop.

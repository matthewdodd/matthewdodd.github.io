            . I am a gardener. Mr. Bramble is a watchmaker
, of Oxford-street, and has a summer-house at Bayswater


. On the 23d of November I was at work just by my father's premises, about seven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner, with another person, coming up the lane, from Mr. Bramble's garden; the otherheld the prisoner's hat while he got through the hedge, into another garden; I got over the fence, and secured him - he was a stranger. The summer-house door had been struck with a hammer, but they could not open it; two squares of glass were cut out at the back of the premises, and there they must have got in.
JOSEPH BRAMBLE. I had seen my summer-house safe on the Sunday before this, and left these knives and forks there; the door has been beaten nearly to pieces, and the head of the hammer was left sticking in the door.

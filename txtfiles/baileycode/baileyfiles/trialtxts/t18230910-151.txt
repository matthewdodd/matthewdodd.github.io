            . I am warehouseman to John. Henry Keen and others, who are blue-manufacturers
, and live on Garlick-hill. On the 10th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I received information, went up the hill and saw the prisoner with a cask on his shoulder, and stopped him in St. Thomas Apostle; it belonged to my masters, and contained 61 lbs. of stone blue. I asked where he got it - he said a man gave it to him to carry, and promised him 1 s. I told him to take it back, he endeavoured to escape - we struggled together, another man came up, gave me a blow on the head, but I kept hold of him.

            . I saw Goodrick leading the prisoner by the collar in St. Thomas's Apostle, and assisted in securing him. I have the cask.

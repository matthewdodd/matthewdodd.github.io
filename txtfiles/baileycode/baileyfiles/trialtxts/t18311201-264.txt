            . I live in Hackney-road. I had the care of an empty house; the different persons it belonged to, (who are named in the indictment,) agreed to put me in possession of it, as the ownership was disputed- on the 30th of November I met the prisoner coming out of the house with two sashes in his hand, which I had seen secure the day before, and fixed; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said to get them repaired; the door had been wrenched from the hinges, and taken away, but he had not business there.

            . I had seen the prisoner at the house several times, and on that day I gave information; I saw him getting the sash out of the frame - I told Tidman, and we went and took him.

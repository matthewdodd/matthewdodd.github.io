            . On the 1st of January, about 11 o'Clock in the Forenoon, I went to shift myself, and found the Parlour Door wide open, and found my Velvet Cap lying in the Middle of the Floor; I called to my Wife and told her; she said we were certainly robbed; I went into the Bed-Room (a little Place behind the Parlour, just big enough for a Bed) and I saw the Prisoner laying these Things down upon the Bed .

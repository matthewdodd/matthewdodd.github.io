            . I am a solicitor
. On the 3d of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was at St. Dunstan's church


 with Mr. Robinson, and felt a sudden jerk at my pocket; I turned round and saw two persons, Finlayson was one, and I believe South was the other - South had my handkerchief in his hand, and was giving it to Finlayson, who took it, shifted it to his left, and dropped it. I collared him, and South ran off towards Fetter-lane. Mr. Robinson pursued the other.

            . I was walking with Mr. Burrows, my partner; on his turning round I observed two boys - (South was one) behind. I saw one drop the handkerchief. He collared Finlayson, and I followed South - he was stopped in Fetter-lane and given to me. He said he hoped I would not appear against him. He denied all knowledge of the other.

GEORGE HYDE
. I am a baker. On the 16th of August I was opposite the House of Lords, about three o'clock—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned and saw a policeman, who had hold of Farrer with my handker-chief in her hand-both the prisoners were there—this is my handkerchief—it had been in my coat pocket.





THOMAS DOWSING
. I am a policeman. I was there in plain clothes—I saw the two prisoners in conversation together before this happened—I kept my eye on them—I saw them get as close as possible to the prosecutor—I saw Farrer put her hand into his pocket, and take the handkerchief partly out—she then lifted up the coat, and took it quite out—she was about to hand it to Smith, and I took her with it.





JAMES PORTER
. I am a policeman. I saw what has been stated—it is correct.

Farter's Defence, He took it out of the gentleman's coat, and put it into my hand.

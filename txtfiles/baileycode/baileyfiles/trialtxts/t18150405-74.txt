            . I live at Twickenham. On Saturday, the 17th of September, I observed a lug boat by the edge of the River Thames, between eight and nine in the evening, it was rather dark; she was laying at a wharf by the Thames side, at Twickenham; I heard some men at work shoveling coals; I went to Mr. Turner, knowing he had a lug boat of that description; I and Mr. Turner went to the wharf; I found the boat fastened to the wharf. I spoke to the men who were at work; I could not distinguish who the men were; I spoke to them about the impropriety of the time they were at work, and whose coals they were. Mr. Turner asked them who they were; they made no answer. Mr. Turner then left me; Rednap came on shore; I went towards him; he went into the boat again, and cut the cord that it was fastened by; Rednap I knew; I cannot say who the others were; one of them cut the hawser, and the boat went off. Mr. Turner came and took a boat, and went after it; we found the boat on the Twickenham side, on the heigth, there were a number of coals in the bottom of the boat; it turned out to be Mr. Turner's boat, the Henry. Moore was taken; he escaped.


                  HENRY 
                  TURNER
               



            . I am a corn-chandler; I live at Twickenham. I had a lug boat called the Henry; I lent the Henry to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Gildon
               



            , for the purpose of taking the coals to Mr. Thomas. On Friday evening, the 17th, Mr. West came to me, and informed me there was something going on wrong in my lug boat; I went down to the wharf; I saw there was something going on; Gildon, Moore, and Rednap, took the boat off from Twickenham; I and West hailed the boat; I went down to my own men, and when I came back the boat was gone. I and Mr. West pursued them, and when we came up to the boat, there were a quantity of coals in the bottom of the boat.
Q. Did you examine the cabin - A. No.
Q. How many bushels of coals will the cabin hold - A. Sixty. The prisoner was taken up, and put in the cage, he absconded; and Rednap has also absconded.

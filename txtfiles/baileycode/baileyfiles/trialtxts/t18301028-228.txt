JAMES DUNN. I was in Brownlow-street


 on the 18th of October; there was a puppet-show - I saw a little girl
, and heard a report that some beads were gone from her neck; I dived into the business, and took the prisoner and another into custody; while I had hold of the other, the prisoner stood by, and I saw the beads drop from his person - they had both been close behind the little girl; I found nothing on the other, and let him go - I was close to the prisoner, and am quite positive I saw the beads drop from him.

            . I am the father of Caroline Pinder. She came to me for a halfpenny to see the puppet-show - this necklace was then about her neck, tied with blue cotton and a common gilt snap - I had seen the prisoner before.
Prisoner's Defence. I never was guilty of any thing before, and I do not know what I am brought here for.

, and live in the Burlington Arcade


. On the 3d of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, my back was to the door, and on turning round I saw the prisoner leave the shop, and missed four handkerchiefs from the shew-board, inside the shop. I pursued and stopped her a few yards off, and found them under her shawl.

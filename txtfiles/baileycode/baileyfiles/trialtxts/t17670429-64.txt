            . I am a carpenter; last Saturday I was at work for Mr. Colins at the house of Esquire Hanway in Conduit-street


; and when I came again on the Monday, I found there were fifty-three feet of leaden pipe in one length, and eleven in another that lay in the street, that runs into the cistern in the house, from the New River waterworks, were taken away, and the pump was gone; part of the pipe I had taken up, and as I thought, secured it in a case, but that was broke to pieces.

            . I am a watchman; that night between eleven and twelve, I heard a noise in the area of this house; I looked, and saw the prisoner there; he came up, I laid hold of him; he slipt away, I catched him again, and with assistance secured him in the watch-house; then I and

             another watchman, went into the area; there we found the lead, and this hand-saw; (producing one) there is lead in the teeth of it, the case was puiled to pieces; the prisoner left his coat there, we carried it to him on the Monday morning, and he owned it: he has it on now.

Prisoner's defence.
The area was open; I went down, there was no fence, the watchman came and knocked my hat off, and I never saw it since.

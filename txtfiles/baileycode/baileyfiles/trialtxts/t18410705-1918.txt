FREDERICK CHESHIRE
 was indicted

 for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



William Aston, about twelve in the night of the 
1st of July, at 

Christchurch, with intent to steal, and stealing therein 1 gown, value 12s.; and 1 shawl, value 2s.; his goods.






JANE ASTON
. I am the wife of William Aston, of King-street, Spitalfields, in the parish of Christchurch: it is our dwelling-house. My husband went out on Thursday night, a little before twelve o'clock—he left the key behind him—I ran after him with it, and locked the door—I am sore of that—I returned in about five minutes, and when I was three doors from my window I saw a man jump out of the window, and one out of the passage—I called "Stop thief," ran after them, but could not see any thing of them—I returned again, unlocked my door, went in, and missed my new gown—I went back, but could see nothing of them—I saw a policeman, who called me—this is the gown now produced, and shawl also.





HENRY PRIDGEON
. I am a policeman. About twelve o'clock at night I heard the cries of a woman—I met the prisoner running, and stopped him—he had the gown and shawl under his arm—I observed the premises—the shutters had been forced—there was a bolt in the middle of the shatters—they had been pulled open by main force—the loop the bolt goes into was wrenched from the shutters, and the window was open.

Prisoner's Defence. About twelve o'clock at night I was at my brother's, in the Kingsland-road; my brother came and told roe my wife was very bad; as I came under the railway arch, I kicked against this bundle; the policeman stopped me, and asked me, as I was running home, where I was going; I said I was going home to see my wife, who was very poorly; he asked where I came from; I told him.





HENRY PRIDGEON

re-examined. I met him about four hundred yards from the prosecutor's.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Baron Alderson.

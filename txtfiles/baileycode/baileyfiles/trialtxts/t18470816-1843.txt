ELIZABETH RAWLINSON.
 I live with my father and mother in Whitecross-street—my father's name is Robert—on the 30th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the shop, and saw the prisoner take some stockings which were outside the door, but not in the street—I went out of the shop and got a policeman to go in search of him—he brought him back—the

stockings were gone—I lost sight of the prisoner, but I had seen him before two or three mornings in the same week.





WILLIAM ANDERSON
 (policeman.) I received information from the last witness, ran after the prisoner, and took him.





GEORGE KEMP
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted, June 1845, and confined two months)—he is the person.




GUILTY. † Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

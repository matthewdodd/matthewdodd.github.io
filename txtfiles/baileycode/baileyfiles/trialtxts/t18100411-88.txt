. On Monday the 5th of March, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and stole twenty yards of print; she drew it up her clothes through the inside of her pocket.

When she came out, I caught hold of her. and the property dropped from under her clothes; this is the property; it is John Davies's.

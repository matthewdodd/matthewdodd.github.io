1222. 




ANN TURNER
 was indicted

 for stealing 18 yards of printed calico, value 10s., the goods of 



Joseph Norberry; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN ADAMS
. I am shopman to Joseph Norbury, of Crawford-street, Brunswick-square. On the 26th of March I missed a piece of calico from outside the shop—it is my master's—I had seen it safe the same day.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) I produce the calico. On the 26th of March I saw the prisoner with another girl, in Oxford-street—the prisoner had this calico wrapped up in her apron—I asked where she got it—she said, "What is that to you?"—I said, "You know me?"—she said, "Yes"—she said it was a piece of print she had bought of a woman—before the Magistrate she said she bought it of a woman in Oxford-street.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (police-constable B 95.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Guildhall at Westminster—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 14th of December I was in a back room, and saw through the glass door the prisoner come in and take a looking-glass, put it under her arm, and go out of the shop. I went out and pursued her, and charged her with taking a glass. I took up her cloak, and under it I saw the glass, which I took, and immediately charged a constable with her.

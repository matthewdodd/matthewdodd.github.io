                  Thomas 
                  Martin 
               



            . I employed 
               
                  Jane 
                  East 
               



             as a servant
. At times, in my absence, she took the liberty to take things by degrees out of my drawers, and pawn them.
Q. How do you know that?
Martin. After I took her up she confessed it, and signed her confession before justice Welch.
Q. Did she confess she stole the things mention'd in the indictment?
Martin. She did.
Q. Where did she say she pawn'd them?
Martin. She said she pawn'd them at three several places, some at Mr. Fryer's in Wych Street, some at Mr. Brigs's in Russel-Street, and some at Mr. Tucker's in Drury-Lane.
Q. What do you say against 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



            ?
Martin. I have nothing to say against her, only seeing her go backwards and forwards to the other prisoner.


                  Sarah 
                  Brigs 
               



            . The prisoner East brought a shift, apron, and handkerchief to me, and told me they were her own. I took them of her, and after that Mr. Martin came and claim'd them as his property.


                  John 
                  Fryer 
               



            . On the 4th of June 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



             came and pledged a remnant of cambrick and a remnant of lace to me for 3 s.
Q. to Martin. Had 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



             any access to the room where these remnants were in your house?
Martin. No, she had not. I don't apprehend she took these things.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Tucker 
               



            . The two prisoners came together, and East pledged a piece of lace with me, but she put it in Ann Palmer's name.
Q. Was Palmer with her when she pledged it?
E. Tucker. No, she was not that time (the goods produced in court, and deposed by the prosecutor.)
East's defence.
I was frightned before the justice. I know nothing of the things indeed.
Palmer's defence.
I am innocent of it, and know nothing of the matter.
For 
               
                  Jane 
                  East 
               



            .


                  Elizabeth 
                  Mills 
               



            . I have known 
               
                  Jane 
                  East 
               



             ever since she was three years old, and never knew any harm of her.
For 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



            .
Mrs. Walker. I have known 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



             some time, and she always behaved well. She was servant
 with me nine months, I trusted her with all I had, and never heard any ill of her.


                  John 
                  Hyde 
               



            . I have known Palmer between seven and eight years. She lived servant with me about half a year. I keep a publick house, and have trusted her a week or a fortnight together with the key of my till, and every thing I had, and would do it now if she was clear; if I thought she was not honest, I should not appear here now. I was headborough and had other business at justice Fielding's at the time the prisoners were there; I heard East there declare Palmer knew nothing of the matter.


                  Mary 
                  Hyde 
               



            . I am wife to the last evidence. I have known 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



             a great while, have trusted her from the top to the bottom of my house, and never missed a farthing in my life; was she acquitted I would take her in with all my heart.


                  Mary 
                  Bourne 
               



            . I have known 
               
                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               



             betwixt eleven and twelve years, and know nothing ill of her. She has honestly work'd for her bread.


                  Ann 
                  Palmer 
               





               Acquitted
            .


                  Jane 
                  East 
               





               guilty

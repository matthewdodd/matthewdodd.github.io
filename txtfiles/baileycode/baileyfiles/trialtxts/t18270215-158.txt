            . My husband, John King, keeps a cheesemonger's shop
, in Wellington-street, Goswell-street


. On the 30th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I just turned my back to go into the parlour - the prisoner came in, and took this ham off the window - I pursued, and he dropped it at my feet, four doors off - he was taken without getting out of my sight.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your back was turned? A. I was just going into the parlour; I had seen him before - the window was shut. My husband has left me this eighteen months.

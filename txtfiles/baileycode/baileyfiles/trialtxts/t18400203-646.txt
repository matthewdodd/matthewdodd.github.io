MARY ANN BELL
. I am the wife of Joseph Bell, a shoemaker, in William-street, Marylebone. On the 24th of January the prisoner was lurking about the window—I suspected him, and told him to go away—he crossed the road to the butter-shop, and attempted to take a rabbit, but seeing somebody come towards the window, he came across to my shop again, and when I was engaged with a customer, he came to the door-post, untied a pair of boots, and put them under his jacket—I ran out and collared him—he struggled with me, and in the scuffle he put the boots on the nail again—he then told me he had not done any thing—I am sure he had them in his hand, quite off the nail.

Prisoner's Defence. They fell off the nail—I went to put them up, and she caught hold of me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 11.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.


Before Mr. Justice Williams.

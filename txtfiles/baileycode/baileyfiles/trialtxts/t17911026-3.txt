             sworn.
I am a single woman; I lost the articles in the indictment at the fire; I am a maid of all work to Mr. Wiles, the things were lost from the house, my things were lost from a three pair of stairs room, they were in a pillow case, the great coats were not in the pillow case, the things I saw upon the day of the fire, I put them into a pillow case, I dropped them down the well stair case; the fire was then burning; I saw the things in the hands of the Constable, he brought them the next morning, it was ten at night when the things were thrown down.

             sworn.
There was a fire very near my house: I had two great coats, they were in a cupboard where I always keep them, opposite to the well stair case; I had one of them on on the Sunday; the fire was on Tuesday 20th of September; the constable has the coats, he shewed them to me the day after the fire.

             sworn.
I am a dealer in glass: I went to see the fire, and assist Mr. Wiles; I saw this prisoner come out of the front door of Wiles's house with two bundles, seeing he went a different way I seized him; he had one bundle on his shoulder, and another on his arm; I told him I knew him, that he inhabited Petticoat-lane; I let him go then, he was about half a dozen yards from Wiles's house, he was not very willing to let them go, he held them tight; Petticoat-lane is about two hundred yards from Mr. Wiles's house; the bundles were taken to Mr. Thorpe's, he lives in Aldgate, about twenty yards from Mr. Wiles's house; after I took the first bundle from him, I saw him in a quarter of an hour, upon the threshold of Mr. Wiles's door; I am positive as to the man.

             sworn.
I am Constable: on the 20th of September there was a fire in Houndsditch; I met the prisoner with the bundle under his right arm, about half past ten o'clock, it was not concealed; this great coat was across the bundle when I took them, I asked him what he had there, he said I had no business with him; I collared him and took the bundles, I missed my hold of him, and took hold of his collar, he twisted round and hurt my finger, it has been lame ever since; he got away from me, I pursued him, and called stop thief, he was stopped by a young man; when he came to the watch-house he said damn your eyes you Jew b - r, I sha'nt weigh forty yet; he after that offered to give me a strike, not to swear against him; he told me a strike was a guinea.

             sworn.
I am a butcher: a man hallooed stop thief! I run after him and stopped him; I took him to the watch-house: Lyon was at the watch-house, it was Lyon who cried stop thief; I saw the bundle lay on the seat.
(The prosecutor looked at the great coats, and deposed to them.)
I have had one of them a year and a half, the other not so long, it is a new one nearly.

            . (Deposed to a cloth cloak, a green baize petticoat, and a callimanco one.) In fact they are all mine, I missed them all on the night of the fire.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
About half past nine, I was coming home from Catherine-wheel-alley, I had been to my cousin's; Lyons accused me of the bundle, I struck him; but I am innocent of the robbery, I know nothing at all about it.



               GUILTY
            . (Aged 20.)
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

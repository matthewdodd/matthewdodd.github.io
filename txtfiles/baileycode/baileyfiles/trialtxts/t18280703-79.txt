JAMES WEST. I am a haberdasher
, and live in Shoreditch


. The prisoner was my servant
 of all-work, but had nothing to do with the shop. On Monday, the 9th of June, I missed a piece of ribbon, which I discovered to be cut in the drawer; I told Miss Backhouse of it, and said I would search the boxes - I went to the prisoner's box, and found the ribbon I had missed, and all these other articles - they are all mine; this parcel was found under Miss Backhouse's bed.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you reason to believe that her connections are respectable? A. I do not know anything against it; I am not desirous of pressing harshly against her by any means - her friends have promised to take her, and act kindly to her; I believe it is her first offence; she pushed back the sash, and took the goods from the place they had been in in the warehouse.

            . I live in the service of the prosecutor. I was present when the goods were found - I know nothing of the bundle which was under the foot of my bed.(Property produced and sworn to.)

CHARLES BOTT. I am waiter
 at the Yorkshire Stingo


; the billiard-room is on one side of the green. I lost these balls on the 10th of November, off the table - I do not know the prisoner - it was a private table, and I always kept the key of it - I had seen them all safe at six o'clock, there were two sets on the table, and some persons were playing in the next room, but the door of the private room was locked.

             TOMLINSON. On the 10th of November the prisoner brought three balls to pawn for 5s.; I asked if they were the balls he brought three weeks before, which I had refused - he at last said he had offered them, and I gave charge of him.

             (Police-constable D 110). I took the prisoner.

            . I know these balls - they are an old set of balls turned up, and there are several marks which the turner could not get out of the red ball - it had been a blue one - I missed some exactly the same size as these.
Prisoner. Q. Could not other balls have been marked the same as these? A. No, not in the way this is done; I lost two sets of balls three weeks before, when I saw a person, who I believe was you, who asked me for a situation.

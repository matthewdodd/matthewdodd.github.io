EDWARD PRITCHETT. On the 30th of July I was under an arch-way, leading to Palace-yard


 - when I had been there half an hour the officer told me I had lost my handkerchief - I saw the prisoner then in custody - I had not seen him before, nor felt any pull at my pocket - I felt my handkerchief safe just before.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner following the prosecutor - he put his hand into his pocket, and then put it into his left breast - I ran after the gentleman, and Tyrrell took the handkerchief from the prisoner.

            . I took this handkerchief from the prisoner's left breast-pocket - we had followed him, but I did not see him take it - he said "Don't hurt me, I will go quietly."

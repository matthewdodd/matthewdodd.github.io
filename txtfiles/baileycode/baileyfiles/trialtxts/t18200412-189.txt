            . I live in Great George-street, Westminster


, and am coachman
 to Dr. Sutherland. On the 9th of April, about nine o'clock at night, I left the property safe in the stable, I was called up about four o'clock in the morning, by the watchman, and found the stable door broken open; the lock was picked, and I missed the property out of a box.

            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner in Prince's-street, Westminster, about three o'clock in the morning, with a bundle, about a quarter of a mile from the stable. He said it was dirty linen, which he had brought from Grosvenor-square, and was taking to his mother to be washed. I took him to the watch-house, and found it to be the property stated in the indictment - three of the shirts were clean.

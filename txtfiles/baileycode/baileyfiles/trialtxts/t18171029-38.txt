            . I am a haberdasher
, and live in Great Russell-street


. On the 14th of October, between six and seven o'clock, I was called down from tea by Ann Hay, who was left in charge of the shop, with another person; I found the prisoner in charge with the bombazett, which he had taken from inside the door.
ANN HAY. I am servant to Mr. Slate. On the 14th of October, my master was at tea; I was in the shop with a young woman named Prite; as I entered the shop from the passage. I saw a man make three attempts to enter the door and go back again; I told Prite to stay in the shop; I went out and saw nothing of him; I stepped over the kennel and saw the prisoner come out of the shop - I turned round and collared him and took him in. He tried to get away - A gentleman stopped him; I called my master - I took the stuff from him at the door; the officer took him. Prite was in the shop - She is not here.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I thought I knew the girl in the shop and looked in at the door - I leaned my hand on the pile of goods but never took any.

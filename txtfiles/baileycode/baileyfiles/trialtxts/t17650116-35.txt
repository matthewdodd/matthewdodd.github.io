                  John 
                  Parker 
               



            . I am a linen-draper
, and deal in silk handkerchiefs, neckcloths, and the like. On the 14th of December, in the evening, when my men came to shut up my shop, they found some silk handkerchiefs missing; upon which, I advertised.
Q. Where do you live?
Parker. I live in the Strand





. I found the window broke, where the handkerchiefs lay. Mr. Wyn brought the woman at the bar, and Rose Foy to me, on the Monday after; he brought three silk handkerchiefs; (Produced in court); these I can safely swear are part of what I lost that evening; one of them has a particular mark upon the end of it. 
               
                  Alice 
                  Roney 
               



             said, she bought them of a sailor in Rag-fair, that morning, and that she bought only these three: the next morning, she said she bought them of a sailor and two boys, in Rag-fair.
Q. Where did she live?
Parker. She lived in Petticoat-lane. The next morning, Rose Poy gave an account where part of the goods were; and went with us, where we found them. We found some at the Fountain alehouse, in Rosemary-lane, sold to a Quaker, that came from Taunton; there were eighteen of them: we brought the Quaker before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; he gave his affirmation he bought them of two women; he would not swear, so can be of no service here; but here is an evidence in court that saw him buy them: and, by Foy's information, we found Mrs. Perry, who had bought seven; she lives in the same lane: and at Mr. Burton's, in the same lane, we found three more. On the Monday following, a person came to me, and said, he believed his son was concerned in the robbery, and desired I would get him admitted an evidence.
Q. What is his name?
Parker. His name is Fish; the lad is in court. I took him to Justice Fielding's; there he gave his evidence, and was admitted an evidence to come here. There was another boy taken up, upon his evidence, whose name was Gammon, but nothing was found upon him. M'Donald was taken up, and the rest of the prisoners, but they denied knowing any thing of the robbery. (The eighteen handkerchiefs found at the Fountain, seven at Mrs. Perry's, and three at Mr. Burton's, produced and deposed to). M'Donald and Farrel both said, they knew nothing of the evidence Fish, but said, he was set on by the thieftakers.


                  Thomas 
                  Fish 
               



            . I am turned of thirteen years of age.
Q. If you should take a false oath, what do you think will become of you?
Fish. I should sell my soul to the d - l.
Court. Now take care, and say nothing but what is true.
Fish. I shall say nothing but truth.
Q. How long have you been acquainted with M'Donald and Farrel?
Fish. About three weeks or a month.
Q. Where did you become acquainted with them?
Fish. In Chick-lane. 
               
                  Frank 
                  Farrel 
               



             asked me to go out with him and Kitt M'Donald. I know him to be a thief: I was drinking with them. I know Farrel to be a pickpocket.
Q. Did you go with them?
Fish. They inticed me with them.
Q. Where did you live?
Fish. I lived in Redcross-street.
Q. At what alehouse was you drinking with them?
Fish. At the Hog in Armour. We walked towards St. James's: when we got to St. James's, I heard them talking about this robbery: and as we came along, back again, we saw a glass was broke; they shov'd it in.
Q. Where was this?
Fish. This was in the Strand, by Charing-cross.
Q. to Prosecutor. Whereabouts in the Strand do you live?
Prosecutor. I live opposite Somerset-house; he is now giving an account of another robbery.
Fish. After the glass was shov'd in, we took out some white cambrick spotted handkerchiefs; then we went to Mr. Parker's window, and took out an hundred and six handkerchiefs.
Q. Was nobody in the shop?
Fish. Mr. Parker's young man was in the shop, while we were taking them; he was packing up some linen. Then we went to Kitt M'Donald's room, in Black-boy alley, and counted them. (He takes up some red and white ones). I can swear these were some of them: there were some black silk ones.
Q. What was done with them?
Fish. They were all sold for 4 l.
Q. Was you present at the sale of them?
Fish. I was.
Q. What share of the money had you?
Fish. I had 24 s.

                  Farrel

                  Dick
               


             the sailor, went to this woman at the bar, into Petticoat-lane, with them.
Q. What share had the others of the money?
Fish. I had as much as Farrel. Kitt M'Donald and 
               
                  Dick 
                  Gammon 
               



             had the rest of the money. 
               
                  Dick 
                  Gammon 
               



             had about 16 s.
Q. Who is 
               
                  Dick
               


             the sailor?
Fish. He was only at the selling them; he was not at the stealing them. He sold eighteen for 24 s. to the woman at the bar: What we sold came to 3 l. 4 s. M'Donald sold another quantity for a guinea, while we were gone. 
               
                  John 
                  Roney 
               



             was by, when his wife bought them of 
               
                  Dick
               


             the sailor: he would not buy them, except he had one to wear about his neck. 
               
                  Dick
               


             the sailor knows Roney and his wife; I did not know them before.
Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of these handkerchiefs?
Prosecutor. Many of them cost me 4 s. 4 d. apiece; some 3 s. 10 d. and some 4 s. the whole of the handkerchiefs were worth 15 l.
Q. to Fish. What sort of money did you receive for the handkerchiefs at Farrel's?
Fish. He gave us two half guineas, and a guinea, and took the money out of a snuff-box.
Q. Did you tell Farrel how you came by them?
Fish. 
               
                  Dick
               


             the sailor did. Roney said, the gentlemen would take notice of such little boys as us drinking beer; so he came and took us up into his room.
Q. What do you know about 
               
                  Jonathan 
                  Parker 
               



            ?
Fish. I have nothing to say about him. He was not in the robbery.
Q. from M'Donald Can you say I was going along with you?
Fish. You was, and stood at the corner of an alley; and took them as we brought them down to you: we loaded ourselves, and went to you; then we all went home.

Fish. Gammon, I, and Farrel did.

Fish. No: when we came in, there was 
               
                  Jack 
                  Adison

Q. Where did you meet with them first?
Gammon. We had been drinking together at the Hog in Armour, in Field-lane?
Q. Where did you set out from, when you did this robbery?
Gammon. We were at Kitt M'Donald's, in the morning, and we went out to take a walk; we walked about the Park, till it began to be dusk: then we went a little way down the Strand, on this side Charing-cross; there we robbed a shop of thirteen handkerchiefs; it is the shop of Mr. Dent; they were red and white ones; then we went on towards home; we saw a pane of glass was cracked in Mr. Parker's shop-window; we pushed the glass in.
Q. Who did that?
Gammon. I can't say who did it; we were all four together: we took out the handkerchiefs: Kitt M'Donnald stood a little way off; we gave him some of them; then he went a little farther off, and after that he crossed the way to Somerset-house.

                  Jack 
                  Adison 
               



            ; he said, he knew where to sell some of them.
Q. What is he, a man or a boy?
Gammon. He is a man grown; he took one or two out, and went and sold them; he came back, and said, he could sell half a dozen more.
Q. Who did he give the money to?
Gammon. He gave that to M'Donald; I don't know how much: he took half a dozen, and came back again, and said he could not sell them.
Q. How long was he gone with the two handkerchiefs?
Gammon. He was gone about twenty minutes?
Q. Where did he say he sold them?
Gammon. I don't know that.
Q. Did you sell any?
Gammon. I and 
               
                  Jonathan 
                  Parker 
               



             sold some, but not that night: Kitt M'Donald said it would not be safe to have them at his lodgings; he would take them to his mother's: we took them there; there Parker was sitting; we opened the handkerchiefs, and Parker said he could sell some for us.
Q. Where does

             live?

Q. Was Parker to have any share of the money?
Gammon. No, he was not.
Q. What is Parker?
Gammon. He is a gentleman's servant out of place.
Q. Did Parker ask you, how you came by them?
Gammon. No; he did not: when I came home it was dark: Fish; Farrell, and 
               
                  Dick
               


             the sailor, were gone to sell the handkerchiefs: I was tired, and went to bed.

Q. to Mrs. Perry. Did you see either of these boys, when you bought them, Fish and Gammon?

                  Lee 
               



            . I lodge at the Fountain, in Rosemary-lane: there was a quaker, a country-dealer, lodged in the house: I happened to be by, one day; there were two women sat in a box; they asked him if he bought handkerchiefs.
Q. Was the woman at the bar one of them?
Lee. I know Rose very well; she was one of them; but I am not certain the prisoner was the other.


                  John 
                  Wyn 
               



            . I keep a sale-shop near Rosemary-lane. On the 17th of December I had been looking over the papers there I read about Mr. Parker's being robbed: I charged all my people, if any handkerchiefs were brought, to stop them; in about half an hour after came 
               
                  Alice 
                  Roney 
               



             and Rose Foy; they offered me these three handkerchiefs (here produced); one of them had them in her apron: they both acknowledged their buying them in Rosemary-lane; they brought them to sell. I asked them whether they had any more: they said, no, they had only these three; they took out but one, at first, but my wife seeing more in her apron, she took the other out. I desired them to recollect who they bought them of, and when; they said, they bought them about half an hour before they brought them to my shop, of a man in a striped waistcoat: I said, is he a seafaring man; they said, they did not know: the man they described answered the description of the man they call 
               
                  Dick
               


             the sailor, that is indicted for another robbery: the woman said, he had china to sell, and that they bought nothing of him but these three handkerchiefs.
Q. Which told you this?
Wyn. The woman at the bar did: then I sent my boy for the Daily-Advertiser, and read over the advertisement to them, and said, they must certainly know of the rest; they would not own any farther: I said, they must go along with me to Mr. Parker, and if the handkerchiefs were not his property, they should have them again; we met with him at home: as soon as he saw this fag handkerchief, he said, these are part of my goods, that I lost; then the woman were taken to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, and committed for further examination.
Q. What time of the day did they come to you?
Wyn. This was in the morning.
Q. Where is Rose Foy?
Wyn. She is got away: she had been with us up and down the lane, to discover where the things were sold: she had said to Mr. Parker, that she would make an ample discovery, after she was committed; since she has been let go at liberty, she has got away, and we have made all the enquiry we can about her, but cannot meet with her.
Mrs. Lee. I know 
               
                  Alice 
                  Roney 
               



            : about a fortnight before Christmas she brought a parcel of handkerchiefs to me; it was on a Sunday morning: she asked me to let the bundle stay till evening, and then she would take them away, and not let her husband know it: she borrowed a flat-iron of me: when she was gone, I opened the corner of the parcel, and saw they were handkerchiefs: some on the top were black.

            . I keep the Hog in Armour, in Field-lane: much about Christmas time, the father of Fisher came in, one day about noon, and took the boy away; saying, he heard he was in company which he did not like: at that time M'Donald, Farrell, and Gammon were in company with him.
Q. How often have you seen them together?
Page. To the best of my knowledge, I have seen them all together twice: I have kept the house but eights weeks to-day.
M'Donald's Defence.
I am innocent of what I am accused with: they searched my place, and found nothing: they took me up upon another thing, and I went voluntarily along with them.
Farrel's Defence.
I know nothing at all about it: I never saw the boys in my life: I live in Chick-lane; my father and mother both died within twelve months: my uncle supports me; he lives in Chick-lane, and sells rabbits and wild-ducks.

            's Defence.
The man is not here that I bought these handkerchiefs of: he asked me, if I dealt in buying and selling: I said, yes; he had some silk handkerchiefs, (this was in Rosemary-lane): he said he had some china, bed, and bedding. I bought some handkerchiefs of him, for one shilling and nine-pence apiece; my partner went and sold afeather-bed, and brought the money to pay for them; then we went to sell them.

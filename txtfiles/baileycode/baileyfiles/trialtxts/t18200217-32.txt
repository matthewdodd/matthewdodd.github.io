            . I am a hosier, and live opposite Mr. Flint. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and two others lurking about his window. I saw the prisoner very busy, went over, and saw it was cut. As I crossed the road the prisoner ran through Monument-yard - the others went away. I pursued, secured him in Pudding-lane, and found nine pair of silk gloves under his coat. I took him back; one of the boys met him, and said,
"Halloo, Jem!"
(Property produced and sworn to.)
DANIEL BOGGIS. I took the prisoner in charge; he said a gentleman gave them to him to carry to Tower Hill. I found a knife on him with the point broken.
Prisoner's Defence. A sailor asked me to carry them to Tower Hill, and said if I was asked what I had got, I was to say nothing.

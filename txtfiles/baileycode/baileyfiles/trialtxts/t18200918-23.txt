            . I am a butcher, at Newgate-market On the 4th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go down Rose-street, I watched him all down the street, lost sight of him, and in two minutes he came up Rose-street again with a flat on his shoulders, I followed him across the market, and collared him in Paved-alley, he threw it off his shoulder, and begged of me to let him go - he said he was out of place, I said he had turned a number of young men out of place himself. I saw Bowles come up, claim the flat, and said he had but just put it where it was taken from. I give him to the officer.

JOHN BAILEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of Feb., 1 copper, value 1l., the goods of 



Stephen Goundry, and fixed to a building; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH MADON
. I am the wife of Thomas Madon. I resided in a house of Mr. Stephen Goundry's at Hillingdon—I left it on the 20th of Feb., the copper was then safe, and fixed in the house—this is it—I am quite sure it is Mr. Stephen Groundry's.





JAMES DARVILL
. On Monday evening, the 27th of Feb., I was going to my house on Uxbridge-moor, which is about 100 yards from Mr. Goundry's house, where Mrs. Madon had lived—I met the prisoner and another man—they were both carrying the copper—as I came round the corner of a wall they dropped the copper and ran away—I am sure the prisoner was one of them—this is the copper they were carrying.





JOHN ROLLE
. I am a labourer. On the evening of the 27th I was going home from my work—I met the prisoner and the other man on Uxbridge-moor—they had the copper with them—I said to the prisoner, "Halloo, my lad, where are you going?"—I am sure the prisoner was the man, and there was another with him—they dropped the copper.

Prisoner. Q. Had not Mr. Darvill got the copper when you came up? A. No, you dropped it.

Prisoner. He said Mr. Darvill had it when he came up; I am innocent of it





RICHARD ROADNIGHT
 (police-sergeant T 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN GRIMME



 the younger was indicated for stealing 1 pair of trowsers, value 15s., the goods of 



John Grimme the elder, and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






MARY GRIMME
. My husband's name is John—the prisoner is my son—he lived with us. On Thursday, March 4th, I missed a pair of trowsers of my husband's from a box—I had seen them there on the Monday before—the screw of the lock had been taken out and put temporarily in again—the prisoner left home on Tuesday—I did not see him again till Friday, when I found him in Stafford-street, Lisson-grove—I asked what he had done with his father's trowsers—he at first denied it—he afterwards said he had sold them to Taylor, a dog fancier—he went with me to a man who said his name was Taylor, but he knew nothing of the trowsers or the priosoner—I gave the prisoner into custody—I went to the police-office on Saturday, and when I got home I found the trowsers returned to me, in a paper parcel.





THOMAS FITZGERALD
. I live at sale-street, Paddington. On a Tuesday morning, about the end of Feb., about half-past nine o'clock, I met the prisoner at the corner of Salisbury-street and Church-street—he told me he had a pair of trowsers to sell—I said, "where are you going?"—he said, "Not far"—I said, "you do not know where to sell them"—he said, "yes I do"—I said, "come on, I will take a walk with you"—we went to the Wheat Sheaf—he went away and fetched the trowsers—I went with him to Manning-street, and he offered them to a man there for 10s., the man offered 7s., and the prisoner took it—I did not know where he had got them from.





JOHN GRANGER
 (police-constable D 21.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—convicted Jan. 1846, and confined four months)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.

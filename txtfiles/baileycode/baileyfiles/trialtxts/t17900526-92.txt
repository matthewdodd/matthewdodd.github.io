I am foreman
 to the Board of Ordnance, and worked for it twenty years: I am a smith
, and a single man
. I was crossing Little Tower-hill


 on Monday, the 24th of May, near the end of the Minories, about half after eleven at night; the prisoner accosted me; I turned round, and she forcibly pulled my watch out of my pocket; I seized her with the watch, but I never recovered it; I laid hold of her arm immediately: I took her to the watch-house: I did not find the watch: she called out to somebody by name, and a man and a woman came close to her: I saw nothingpass: it was dusk: I never parted with the prisoner: at Guildhall she said, if she delivered the watch again, what could they do to her then: I am sure the prisoner is the person: no other person was by: I never saw her before: I had been in liquor: I was quite sober.

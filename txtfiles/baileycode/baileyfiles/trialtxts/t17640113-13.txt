            . I had seen the prisoner about some pieces of cloth on Gally-key


, and I watched him very narrowly; this was on the 14th of December, and between two and three in the afternoon, somebody said there was a piece gone; I went and took it from under his coat, about twenty yards from where the cloth lay; he said, somebody gave him the piece, and, when before the Alderman, he said he found it: then he said he thought it was a piece of bread. (Produced in court.)
Q. Whose property is it?
Schemedes. It is the property of Messrs. Hill and Hague.
Prisoner's Defence.
The gentleman says I stole it: I took it up upon the open Key, before a thousand men that might all see me it: was one of the carmen that stood by, that said it was a lunch of bread.
He called

            , who had known him two years; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Grenaway 
               



             about three quarters, and

                  Birch 
               



             about three months, all gave him a good character.

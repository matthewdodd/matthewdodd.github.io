MART MASSEY
. I am the wife of Richard Massey—we keep a shop in Cleveland-street, Marylebone. On the 12th of February, about three o'clock, as I was in the parlour I saw the prisoner behind the counter with his right hand in the till—I saw him take some silver out, and put it into his pocket—I went to the door to call a neighbour, and then saw him patting the silver back into the till—I said, "I have been long looking for you, I have caught you at last"—I sent for a policeman, who found 6 1/2 d. on him—I had examined the money before I went into the parlour, and there were two shillings, two sixpences, and two fourpenny pieces—I looked at it when the policeman came in(and two shillings and two sixpences were gone.





HENRY FOWLER
 (police-constable E 111.) I was sent for, and saw the, prisoner standing behind the counter with the till drawn out—I asked him. what he was doing there—he laughed—I asked him what money he had taken from the till—he gave me 6d. and a halfpenny from his pocket, and said, "I have taken this from the till."

JOSEPH ALDERSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



William Simpson, from his person, and that he had before been convicted of felony.






WILLIAM SIMPSON
. I am a plumber. I was in Skinner-street, at six o'clock in the evening of the 20th of December—I felt nothing at my

pocket, but happened to turn round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—he immediately threw it away—I took hold of him, and gave him and the handkerchief to the policeman.
Prisoner. The handkerchief was three yards from me—he took hold of me, took it up, and said I had picked his pocket. Witness. He had two other persons with him, who ran off immediately I took hold of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM HARRISON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office, (read)—I remember the name, but cannot swear he is the same boy now—I gave evidence last December twelvemonth against a person of his name, for picking Mr. Dyson's pocket—I had seen him commit the offence, but it was a much less boy then the prisoner is now—I connot swear to him now—I have not given evidence against any other Alderson—I do not belive he is the same boy—he is grown out of my Knowledge altogether.





MR. WILLIAM WADHAM COPE
 (governor of Newgate) The prisoner was tried in December, 1834, for picking the pocket of Mr. Dyson, the orange-merchant, whom I know well—he is the same boy.

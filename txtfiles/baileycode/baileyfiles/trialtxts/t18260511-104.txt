, from his person
            .
THE HONOURABLE LORD ASHLEY. On the 20th of April, about two o'clock, I was in Great Maddox-street, St. George's


, and felt a pull at my right-hand coat pocket, which made me turn round, and I saw the prisoner endeavouring to get my handkerchief into his hand - he passed me, and ran in front. I know it to be my handkerchief - I had used it ten minutes before. I took him to the office.

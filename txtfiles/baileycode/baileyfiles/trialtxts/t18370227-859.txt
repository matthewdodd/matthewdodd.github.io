 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of February, 1 pair of half-boots, value 5s.; 1 waistcoat, value 2s.; and 1 coat, value 6s.; the goods of 



Henry Ford.






HENRY FORD
. I am a compositor, and live in Parish-street, Lambeth I met the prisoner on the night of the 26th of February, and went home with her—I was drunk—I took off my coat, waistcoat, and boots in her room—I told her I would not go to bed—she said, "You had better sit down an hour, and then you can go home"—I fell asleep—a person came and awoke me, and said the prisoner had run away with my things—these are them.





SARAH IRELAND
. I am a widow, and lodge in Lawrence-lane, st. Giles's. On the morning of the robbery, I saw the prisoner coming out of a room, with a bundle under her left arm—I knew she did not live there, and the person who lived there was out—I stopped her, and died for a light—she threw these things over the stairs, and when the light was brought she had this waistcoat in her hand—this coat and boots were picked up in the area—the prosecutor was in the room—he claimed the things.





JOSEPH CLEMENTS
 (police-constable E 102.) I was called, and took the prisoner—she said, "I took them, and I hope they will give me fourteen years; if they don't, I will go on till they do."




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

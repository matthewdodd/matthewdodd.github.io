TIMOTHY JOYCE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of January, 1 cloak, value 1l., the goods of 



John Lowdon and another.






JOHN LOWDON
. I am a linen-draper, and have one partner—we live

in Crawford-street. On the 6th of January I was standing at the door, about eight o'clock in the evening—I heard something snap—I looked, and saw the prisoner folding up this cloak—I ran after him—he dropped it on the pavement—I followed him to the corner of Gloucester-place, and brought him back—the cloak was still on the pavement—I took it up, brought the prisoner to my shop, and gave him in charge—I knew nothing of him before—this is the cloak; it had been hanging in my lobby——the prisoner was never out of my sight.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

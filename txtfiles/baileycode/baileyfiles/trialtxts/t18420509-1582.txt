1582. 




SAMUEL TAYLOR
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
27th of April, 3lbs. weight of bacon, value 18d., the goods of 



Charles Borer; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM GUDGEON
. I am in the service of Charles Borer, a cheesemonger, in Lower-street, Islington. Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 17th of April, I was in my master's shop—I saw the prisoner take a piece of bacon out of the window—the sash was up—he ran straight down the road—I followed—he threw the bacon away—he was stopped, and given to me—he picked up the bacon, gave it to me, and begged for mercy—I gave him into custody.





WILLIAM HORNSBY
. I am a policeman. I took him into custody, and received the bacon—he said nothing to me.





THOMAS NORTON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

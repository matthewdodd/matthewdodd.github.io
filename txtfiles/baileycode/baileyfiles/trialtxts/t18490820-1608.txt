, breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



John Folley, at 
St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, and stealing 8 yards of printed cotton, and other goods, value 9s. 6d.; his goods: having been before convicted.






SUSAN FOLLEY
. I am the wife of John Folley, of Matthew-street, Shoreditch. I know the prisoner by sight—he has come backwards and forwards, and has gone to work with my husband—on 20th June I left home at nine o'clock in the morning, to go to a day's work—I did not return till tea in the evening—I then found the window had been broken, and my gown and other things were gone—they had been safe when I left home.

Prisoner. Q. Have you not known me seventeen or eighteen yean, and was I not working over the water? A. You went backwards and forwards with my husband—I never knew you to take anything from me before.





MARY ANN COLLYER
. I live by the prosecutor's. I heard the breaking of glass—I went out—I saw the prisoner open her window, and get into her house, about four o'clock in the afternoon—after he came out again, he came to me, and left word for me to tell Mrs. Folley that he had been there—I knew him before.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me? A. Yes, with a bundle under your arm, but I do not know what it contained—you had no bundle when you went in.





JOHN HARVET
 (police-sergeant, G 18). I took the prisoner—he said he was drunk when he did it—he said he had pawned the gown-piece, but be would not say where.

Prisoner. This is all done out of spite.





HENRY DUBOIS
 (police-sergeant, N 118). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Oct., 1848; confined two months)—he is the man.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

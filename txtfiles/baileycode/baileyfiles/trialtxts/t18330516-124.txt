            . I am an auctioneer
, and live in Princes-street, Bank. On the 12th of May, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I was going along Fenchurch-street


, I had a handkerchief in my outside coat pocket; I felt something touch my pocket, I turned round and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hands, he had two companions with him, who went off the moment I laid hold of him; he scuffled very severely and struck me on the face and got away, he was secured in two or three minutes, but I never lost sight of him.

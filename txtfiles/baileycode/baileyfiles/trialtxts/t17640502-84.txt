                  Jackson 
               



            . I am a man's mercer
. On the 29th of February last, a young woman, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jackson 
               



            , was at my house; I sent her with a bundle of linen, containing three shirts, one check apron, one coarse towel, two new sheets, and one coarse handkerchief, which they were tied in, to carry to Fleet-street: she came the next day, and informed me she had been robbed of them in Fleet street


, and that the person suspected was in custody.


                  Mary 
                  Jackson 
               



            . I am niece
 to Mr. Jackson. I received a bundle of linen of Mr. Jackson, in Gracechurch-street, to carry to Fleetstreet, a door on this side the Horn-tavern: I carried it upon my head, and had let it go, to read the direction, and it was taken off my head in a moment: I was frightened, as my aunt told me not to carry it on my head, for fear of being robbed: I cried out, Stop thief, and a man took him, and gave me the bundle.


                  Richard 
                  Greenhill 
               



            . On the 29th of February, between the hours of eight and nine at night, I was coming up Fleet street: near Water-lane, I heard the cry of, Stop thief, and saw the prisoner running first: taking him to be the thief, I caught hold of him; he endeavoured to get from me, and it being slippery weather, he pulled me down on my knee: I recovered myself, seized him again, and saw him drop the bundle: I saw it under his arm, before Mr. Bracket pickt it up: we took him to the Three Tuns, a publick-house; the girl was crying and screaming; she came in, and owned the bundle.

                  Hanwell 
               



            . I am a constable. I had this bundle of the young woman's, at the Three Tuns.



                  Robert 
                  Bracket 
               



            . I was going home from work, along Fleet-street: I saw the prisoner run with the bundle, I believe under his left arm; he swang his hand to strike me, but Greenhill seized him: he dropped the bundle, and I took it up. The young woman said it was her's; I gave it her: I did not see them opened, but they are tied up in the same handkerchief now, as they were then.


                  Robert 
                  Davis 
               



            . On the 29th of February, I was coming up Fleet-street: I saw a man snatch a bundle from 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jackson 
               



            's head: she immediately cried Stop thief; I saw the bundle in his hand, and pursued him: I found him in Bracket and Greenhill's custody. I believe him to be the same man that I saw snatch the bundle.
Mr. Jackson deposed to the goods produced in court, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jackson 
               



            , that they were the same she lost.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was upon my master's business, who is a tobacconist
: being belated, I ran along: I saw a croud, and they were saying the woman had been robbed; they accused me falsly. My master is ill at present, or he would appear to my character. I cut the tobacco.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately from the person
            .

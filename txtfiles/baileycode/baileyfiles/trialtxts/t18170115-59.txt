                           William 
                           Prosser
                        




                     
                  , which Louisa Ellen, at the gaol delivery of Newgate, holden for the county of Middlesex, on the 4th of December, was convicted of stealing; they well knowing them to have been stolen
            .
WILLIAM PROSSER. I live in Goswell-street. I had a servant of the name of 
               
                  Louisa 
                  Ellen
               



            , who was convicted of stealing my cloth. I accompanied Vann, the officer, to the prisoner's house, in Middle-street, Cloth-fair, on the 3d of November; the prisoner, Eliza Macginnis was at home, she had a handkerchief on her neck, which I recognized to be the same pattern, as one of Ellen's gowns. I asked her what she had done with my blue superfine cloth, and if she had any. She at first said, she knew nothing about it. The prisoner, Thomas Macginnis was present; I told her I knew she had some, and that I had got proof of it. She told me to search the premises. I found nothing. I asked her about the handkerchief. She said, it was a small remnant that she had bought in Field-lane. I told her she must go with us. She lives in a small room, with a bed in it, and sells greens; when I got her to the watchhouse, I confronted Ellen, who was in custody, with her. 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Macginnis
               



             said, she knew nothing about Ellen. Ellen said she was the woman who gave her 2l. 10s. for the cloth. 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Macginnis
               



             then said, she would tell the whole truth, and that she had given her 2l. 10s. for the last quantity of cloth. Ellen said, it was for nine or ten yards; which would be worth 9l. 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Macginnis
               



             said, she had seen Ellen twice; she said, she had given her a gown of the same pattern as the handkerchief, and 1l. note for the first parcel, and Ellen had that very gown on at the time. Ellen said, that the prisoner, Thomas Macginnis, was not present at the time.
Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. Ellen had stolen a great deal of cloth from me.


                  THOMAS 
                  VANN
               



            . I am a constable. I accompanied the last witness to Macginnis's house; we took them to the watch-house. 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Macginnis
               



             denied any knowledge of Ellen; she keeps a green-stall. Ellen said, she had sold Macginnis the cloth. She must have heard her. Macginnis at first denied it, and afterwards said, Ellen had brought her the cloth, and that she sold it for 50s.; and gave 
               Ellen
             the money.

Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. Mr. Prosser spoke of cloth and kerseymere; Macginnis spoke of two parcels.

BENJAMEN HAYDON. I am servant to Mr. Prosser. On the 29th of October last, I saw Ellen go out with a bundle, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, she said it was dirty clothes; she went towards Macginnis's house.
ELIZA MACGINNIS'S Defence. I never had the cloth; I only knew the girl by seeing her pass my house.

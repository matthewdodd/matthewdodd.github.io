MARY RELET
. I am cook to Mr. Burton Brown, of Brunswick-square, St. Pancras. On the 11th of August, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I was in the kitchen, and heared a noise—I went into the passage, and saw the prisoner in the pantry—his back was towards me—I called the man-servant, who came to me, and in a moment the priosner ran out of the pantry into the area, and shut me in the passage—I opened the door, and he had fallen down the area steps—he got up, and ran into the square—I called, "Stop thief," and he was brougth back—I am quite certain he is the person—six spoons were found in his hand.






WILLIAM QUICK
. I live with my father in the Strand. I was passing the prosecutor's house and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner come into the area, with spoons in his hand—he fell down on the area steps—I tried to shuit the gate against him, but he got out, and I caught him in the street.





CHRISTOPHER LAWSON
. I am clerk to Messrs. Taylor and Co. I was in Brunswick-square, and observed the prisoner running towards me—I stopped him, and took six silver spoons out of his hand—I took him back, and he gave up to me these eighteen pieces of plate.





CHARLES COOPER
. I am a policeman. I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM HENRY MEAGLE
. I am a pawnbroker. These spoons are worth about 6l., as near as I can guess—I can tell that by weighing them in my hand.
(James Shaw, blind-maker, of Fetter-lane; and----Field, painter, Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road; gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY

Transported for Life.

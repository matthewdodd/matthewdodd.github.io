            , we live in Monmouth-street


. On the 1st of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, this watch hung over the kitchen mantle-piece; the prisoner had bought a gown a week before, and tried it on in the kitchen - it hung there then. On the 1st of November, she came on a frivolous excuse, while I was out; and on returning I missed it. I found it at Philips's.

Prisoner. Q. Was the saucepan in your door, or outside? A. It was partly in, and partly out.
Prisoner's Defence. I have had a situation at Liverpool - I came to London six weeks ago, to get a situation - on Saturday last, I did get one, to go to the East Indies. I met with some young men and got tipsy - I then met a young woman, and took this saucepan for fun, as well as I could recollect, and said to the young woman, "Will you buy a saucepan?" I was then returning to put it back on the shelf, and then the gentleman took me. I was very tipsy.

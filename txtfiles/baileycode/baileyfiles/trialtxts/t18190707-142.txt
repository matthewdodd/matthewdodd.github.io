            . I live at Barking. On the 7th of July I was in town, and left my coat in front of my cart - I saw it safe when I was by Whitechapel church


, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon - I missed it about half an hour after.

            , I sell fruit in Whitechapel. I saw the prisoner and another lad loitering in the road, the cart came by - the prosecutor was by the side of his horses - one 
               drew
             the coat from the end of the cart, the prisoner then stepped into the road, took it out, and walked away with it under his arm. I followed them, and told Solomons, who took the prisoner with the coat, the other got away.

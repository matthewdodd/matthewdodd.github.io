             (police-constable N 82). I saw the prisoner in Hackney-road, and followed him to the prosecutor's shop - I saw him take the leg of pork from the window and give it to another person who was with him - I seized the one who had the pork - he slipped from me, but dropped the pork - I took it up, and took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing the road, and the officer took me - I know nothing of the robbery.

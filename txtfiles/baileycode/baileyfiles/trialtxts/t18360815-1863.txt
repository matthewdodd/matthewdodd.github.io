GEORGE WEBB
. I live in Eagle-street, Holborn. On the 20th of July I was in my parlour, and saw the prisoner coming up from my cellar under the parlour—he got out with a sieve and a server—I took him, and he said a man had sent him to get them from my cellar—I asked where was the man—he said, "At the top of the street"—I went there, and there was no man but a policeman—I gave him in charge.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a man at the corner of Red Lion-street—he told me to go and get them, and he would give me 1d., but he went away when he saw this man coming up.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

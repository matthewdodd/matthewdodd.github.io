MANUEL LOPEZ
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of April, 2 paintings and frames, value 8l., the goods of 



James Thomas Berkley.






JAMES THOMAS BERKLEY
. I am a stockbroker, and live in Threadneedle-street. About the 10th of April, I had two paintings in my office, between the hours of four and five o'clock I left them safe, and in the morning at ten o'clock, when I came to town, they were gone—I made inquiry, but could ascertain nothing about them, until the day before yesterday, when the policeman came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I attended this court.





WILLIAM CLIFTON
. I went to Mr. Berkley's the day before yesterday—I had seen the pictures in the prisoner's premises, but did not bring them away myself—I saw them in his room when I went about the last case—Ward brought them away—seeing the name of the painter, Huggins, on the pictures, we went to Huggins, and in consequence of what his son stated, I went to Mr. Berkley—I had no conversation with the prisoner about them.





GEORGE WARD
. I am a policeman. I brought two paintings away from the prisoner's apartment, with several other things—here are three paintings, but one we have not found the owner of—it is a foreign piece—I found some letters in his box.





JAMES THOMAS BERKLEY

re-examined, I am quite sure these are my paintings—I have had them nearly four years.

Prisoner, I know nothing about them.




GUILTY
. Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years longer.

Before Mr. Baron Gurney.

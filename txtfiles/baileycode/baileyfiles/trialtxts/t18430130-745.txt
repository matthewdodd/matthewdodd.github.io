CHARLES SPIKINS
. I live at the Sceptre Coffee-house, Lincoln's Inn-fields. About nine o'clock, on the 24th of Jan., I was passing down Broad-street, Bloomsbury—I felt something at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner, with my handkerchief in his hand—I called "Stop thief," ran after him, and overtook him at the corner of Great St. Andrew-street—he threw the handkerchief into a cart just before the officer took him—I saw it safe about two minutes before.






JOHN GEARY
 (police-constable F 79.) I saw the prisoner running, And saw him throw this handkerchief into a cart.





GEORGE ANDREWS
 (police-constable G 66.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

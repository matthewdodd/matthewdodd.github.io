            's niece. I was on a visit there on the day this happened; I did not see the stockings taken, but I was called to the door and saw them, and know them to be my uncle's - they had been in the window that afternoon; I had only turned my back about ten minutes and they were gone - they were tied with a string.

            . I am a salesman, and live nearlyopposite to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner go to the door and then go away again - soon afterwards I saw him go and put his arm round the door-post and take the stockings; I took him immediately, without losing sight of him; two or three persons took hold of him - he tried to escape.

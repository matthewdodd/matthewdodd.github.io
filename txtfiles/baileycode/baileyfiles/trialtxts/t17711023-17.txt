            . I picked up the prisoner, in Oxford road; after drinking with her, at several houses, I went home with her to her lodgings; that we went to bed together, that about one in the morning she got up and gave her landlady the candle; then I got up and locked the door. I got into bed again, and we went to sleep together. I waked about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was gone, and I missed the money out of my breeches pocket; I am certain my money was in my pocket when I went to bed. The prisoner was taken up the next day, but nothing was found upon her. I am positive she is the woman.

             deposed that she saw the prisoner on the next morning, that she had five guineas and a half, and some more money about her."

" The prisoner, in her defence, said she knew nothing of the matter."

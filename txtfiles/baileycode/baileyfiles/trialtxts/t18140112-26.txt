Q. Do you keep a shop - A. No, I live in a private house. The prisoner was my servant
; she had lived with me near five years.
Q. When was it you lost these things - A. I suppose them to be taken on the 4th of January. During the time the prisoner has lived with me, I have lost articles of different kinds, and on that morning I missed four shillings; I had the prisoner's box searched, and there this property was found, thirty yards of ribbon; I know them to be mine by their matching with the remainder pieces.
JURY. Who found these things in the prisoner's box - A. I found them, in the presence of my sister, and four other persons.

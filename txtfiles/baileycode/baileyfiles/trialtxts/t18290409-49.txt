            . I am a tailor
, and live in Cutler-street, Houndsditch


. On the 10th of March the prisoner came into my service - she was hired by the year; on the night of the 15th of March my wife's shawl was lying on a chair in the parlour, and the prisoner's bonnet upon it; when we went up to bed, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner took the child up to our bed-room - when she went down I told her to fasten the door - I heard the bolt go, and the chain put up; in about a quarter of an hour afterwards I heard a knock at the door - I called to the prisoner to go down, but no one answered; I then went myself, and the street door was open - the prisoner was gone, and her box; the next morning I missed my wife's shawl - she had given us no notice; we went the following morning to the person who had given her a character, where we received information, which led to her apprehension.

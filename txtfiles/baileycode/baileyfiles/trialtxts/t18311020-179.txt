             - we live in Little George-street, Hampstead-road. The prisoner and I had been brought up together, but I had not seen her for six years till a fortnight before the 24th of September - she called on me several times, and on the 24th of September she came, and I left her in my room while I went for a pail of water, leaving my child in the room; she got up, and said she was going - I let her down stairs, and said, "Good bye;" she said she would come again on the Monday - when she was gone I missed my husband's boots from the next room to where I left her.

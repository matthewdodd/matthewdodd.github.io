Ann Batty. I saw a capuchin of mine drgg'd out of my window on the first of November, at night: after that a young lad came and brought it in and ask'd me if it was mine? I said it was.
Q. What is that young man's name?
A. Batty. His name is 
               
                  William 
                  Shaw 
               



            . The capuchin produced in court and deposed to.

            . I was going on an errand, and heard some body call stop thief. I saw the boy at the bar come running along with this capuchin in his hand, I put out my leg to stop him, but he got by; after that I saw him throw it into a grocer's shop; then he made a full stop, and said, Gentlemen, what's the matter. He then had never been out of my sight from the time I had seen the capuchin in his hand.

            . I was coming along and saw the prisoner running as hard as he could; I follow'd him, and when I was within ten yards of him, he throw'd the capuchin into a grocer's shop, and cry'd Gentlemen what's the matter? he was secured, and the cloak carried to the prosecutrix.
Prisoner's defence. I was going through the court, and heard the words stop thief; I stop'd; a gentleman came up, and ask'd me what I had stole? I said, nothing: when he had got me away from that place, then they said the thing was found.



               Guilty

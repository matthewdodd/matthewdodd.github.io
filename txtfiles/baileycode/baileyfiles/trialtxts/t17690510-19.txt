. The prisoner was shipped on board her the 8th of April. My things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) were taken from off my chest between decks; they and the prisoner were missing together; and, on the Saturday following, I met him at the end of Gravel-lane, with my jacket on. I charged him with taking my things. He owned he had, and said he had sold my boots and trowsers in Rag-fair. He owned the same before the Justices in White-Chapel.
Richard Green. I was at the taking the prisoner. I heard him confess the taking the things.

What they say is quite entirely wrong. I know nothing about them. I have not a friend within two hundred miles.

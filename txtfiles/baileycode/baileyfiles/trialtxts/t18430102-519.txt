JOHN SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of Dec., 1 brush, value 1s.; the goods of 



Thomas Simmonds; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN SIMMONDS
. I live with my father Thomas Simmonds, in Crawford-street. About half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 29th of Dec, the prisoner came to purchase a set of brushes—I showed him a set, and told him they were 3s.—he offered me 2s., and then half-a-crown—I would not take it, and he would not have any, but chucked them down and went away—a little while afterwards a policeman came and asked if I had missed a brush—I looked and missed it—this is it—it is my father's—I had not sold it.





GEORGE ROGERS
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and found this brush in his pocket.





GEORGE ROGERS

re-examined. I produce a certificate of the conviction of the prisoner which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man who was tried here in Oct. last.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years.

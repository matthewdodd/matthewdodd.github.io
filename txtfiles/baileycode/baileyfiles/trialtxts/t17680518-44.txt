            . I live opposite to the White Hart, Golden-lane, I am a labourer
; I was at work at a building in the Minories


 last Wednesday in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner go down into the cellar where my coat lay, and take it away; I ran after him, and catched him about eight or ten doors turning towards Tower-hill, and took it from him, (produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence. *
I met a person who had worked with me, he owed me a trifle of money, I asked him to pay me; he said he had no money, but I might take that coat; I took it; this man came and said it was his own.

                  MARTIN
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Martin
               



            . On the 11th of March, at half-past twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to me and said, my husband, who is a lighterman
, had fallen overboard and was almost drowned, and had sent him for some dry things to put on - he was a stranger. I gave him the clothes stated in the indictment, and a crown-piece, as I knew my husband had no money, and told him to give it to my husband to get something to drink before he came home.
Prisoner. It was not a crown-piece, but two half-crowns - and she gave me a waistcoat, not a jacket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

                  MARTIN
               



            . I am the husband of the last witness - I had not fallen overboard, and never sent the prisoner for any thing. I have known him a long time.
Prisoner. Q. What do you know of me - A. Youhave been transported before for the same sort of offence.

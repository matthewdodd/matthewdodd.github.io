            . I am King's weigher, and attend the keys; I saw the prisoner yesterday at Battle-wharf


, about half an hour after 4 o'clock, take the tobacco from the scale, and run away with it. I pursued him into Thames-street; he threw it away, and a cart stopt him, and I took and secured him: I did not know him before. (Produced in court, 23 pounds of it.)

JOHN DENCH
. I carry milk about, and live in Gun-street, Osborneplace, Whitechapel. On the 10th of October, at half-past four o'clock, I had one coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers there—I left them in my room, lying on my table—these are mine.





GEORGE RIVERS
. I live in Chicksand-street, opposite Mr. Dench's. About half-past four o'clock on the 10th of October, I saw the prisoner take these things out of the window—he is the man—I know him again—I told my master of it.





WILLIAM DENCH
. Rivers called me—I saw the prisoner running with the clothes under his left arm—he dropped them—they were picked up in my presence.

Prisoner. When I was coming out, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw a person running; I asked what was the matter; he said a man had stolen some things out of a window; and while I stood talking to him a gentleman came up and laid hold of me, I was hot near the place, and never saw the clothes.

COURT
to
GEORGE RIVERS, Q. Did, you see the prisoner? A. Yes—he got out the window with the clothes.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

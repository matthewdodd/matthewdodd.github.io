ELIZABETH KING
. I am the wife of John King. I came to town by the Cheltenham van, on the 1st of October, with George Gibbs, from Oxford, and stopped at one end of Fleet-street—I had a band-box with me—the prisoner got out in Oxford-street—he had travelled from Oxford with me—I found him in the van when I got in—I was going to get out in the Edgeware-road—that is where I first missed my clothes—I asked Gibbs to give my box forward—he said he was going to get out—I came to my box and found it was light—I missed the gown and shawl—I called the waggoner—he told the guard to go down Oxford-street and Holborn, and then I came on, and went to a friend to leave my other things, and met the policeman with the prisoner—my property was found on him.





WILLIAM RAIT
. On the 1st of October, about six o'clock, I received information that a robbery had taken place, giving a description of the person, and I stopped the prisoner on Holborn-hill with the things—he was carrying them in his hand.

Prisoner. You did not stop me at all. Witness. He was stopped by a person who had information also—I saw him stopped, with his property and a pair of boots and stockings in the same bundle.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





GEORGE GIBBS
. I came up with this van—these boots and stockings are mine—they were taken out of a bag in the van.

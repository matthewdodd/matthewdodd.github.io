            . I am an oil and colour-man
, and live in Gray's-inn-lane


. The prisoner was my servant
 - on the 12th of March
 I sent him with a sack of salt to Mr. Restler, in Red Cross-street - I gave him a bill of parcels, which was receipted - the amount was 7s. - he left about two, and returned between five and six o'clock - I asked him for the money - he said Mr. Restler did not pay him - I asked him for the bill, which I desired him to bring back, as it was receipted - he said he forgot it - he was at home for about an hour, and then absconded.

            . On the 12th of March, I received the goods and the bill of parcels by the prisoner - it was 7s., but I paid him 6s. - I said I never gave but 6s. a sack for salt, and if that was not right, I would make it right.

             (police-serjeant E 3). I took the prisoner - he said, in going to the station, that he supposed he should go over the water; but that was what he wanted; and he might thank his father for it.

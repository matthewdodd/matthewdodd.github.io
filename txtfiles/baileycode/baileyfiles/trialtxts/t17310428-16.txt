, the first of March
 last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That as she was standing to see the Welsh-Society pass by, the Prisoner stood before her, with his Hands behind him, that he being well dress'd like a Merchants Clerk, she did not suspect him, till perceiving her Apron move, she clapped her Hand to her Pocket Apron and found it had been cut, and her Money gone; upon which she crying out, the Prisoner ran away, but was pursu'd and taken, but flung away the Money in the crowd. This was confirm'd by other Evidence, and the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

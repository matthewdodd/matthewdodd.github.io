            . I am a shopman to Mr. Daniel Stubbs- he lives in Fleet-market


. On the 20th of June I saw the prisoner standing at his door for about half a minute - then called a person in the street, of the name of Goff; he then jumped up, and took down this shawl - he ran up the market, and round the end of it; I jumped over the counter, and pursued him - I did not lose sight of him for two seconds all the time; I can swear he is the man- the shawl is my master's.

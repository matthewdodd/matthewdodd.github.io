            . I live next door to Mr. Camber; I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Cumber's shop, and take a piece of bacon, which he gave to his companion; I took it to be a hock.
Q. to the prosecutor. Did you ever miss any bacon?
Cumber. Yes; I missed a hock that day.
Ryland. The other man went off directly with the bacon; I followed the prisoner and secured him; I never lost sight of him.

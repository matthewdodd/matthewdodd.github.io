             is coachman
 to Mrs
. Hawes, and was gone out of town with his mistress, about the 10th or 11th of last month, the Prisoner confessed before the Justice, that about a month, as he believed, after they were gone out of town, he opened the padlock of Mrs. Hawes's stable-door, and broke open Anderson's chamber-door, and broke open two other locks, and took all his cloaths, and the furniture for the saddle, and ripped two yards of gold lace off it. I asked him, how he came to do it? He said, he could not tell why he did it, for Anderson was a good friend to him.

            . I am coachman to Mrs. Hawes, I went out of town with her the 24th of May last, and left my linen and clothes in my chest, and did not come to town till the 8th of Nov. when I missed my things; I thought it must be the Prisoner that stole them, because he used to be about the stable; the Prisoner said he was glad to see me; I said, I am sure you are not glad to see me; he said, why should not I, for I know nothing of your things; and then I had not told any body that I had lost them: he denied it a great while, at last he confessed that he had robbed me, and that he was one of the vilest rogues in the world, to rob one who had been so good a friend to him; he said, he opened the outside door of the stable by picking the lock, and when he got into the room, he broke open my chest with a poker, and sat upon the bed, and ripped the gold lace off the furniture of the saddle, and that he had sold all the things to an old clothes man in the street, who he did not know, but believed he should know him if he saw him. I carried him before a justice, the justice asked him what he had to say for himself; he said nothing, and the justice said, did you rob this man? he said, yes I did, and sold the things to an old clothes man, he did not know. After he had been there some time, the justice asked him whether he would sign his confession, and the Prisoner said he could not write; then the justice said, you can make your mark; he said, but I will not do it to day : the justice said, you confessed it yesterday, why can't you sign it now? he said, what I did yesterday I can't help, but I won't do it now.
Prisoner. They made me drunk, and when I was in the Round-House, I did not know where I was, for I was not compos mentis.
Anderson. He was not in liquor at any of the times that he made his confession.

            . The Prisoner was brought to St. George's Watch-house the 10th of Nov. about ten o'clock at night, I took him the next morning before a justice. When he came to the Watch-house he was as sober as he is now, (and so he was the next morning) and he confessed every particular as has been mentioned before - he was not threatned or ill used, he was as well used by Anderson as any man could be. 

               Guilty

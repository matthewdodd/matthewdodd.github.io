            . I saw the Prisoner take the Ribbon, went after her, brought her back, and saw the Ribbon taken out of her Apron; there was a Man waiting for her; she said he sent her in, and that he employed her to steal Things, and he sold them: She said he sold 40 Yards in Holbourn, but a little before.

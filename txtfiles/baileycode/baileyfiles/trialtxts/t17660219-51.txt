            . The prisoner was tried here in December sessions, for stealing a pair of boots and some shoes; but these are not them, tho' lost at the same time. The prisoner was taken up at Islington. These things have been stole out of my master's stable, Mr.

            . I bought a pair of boots and shoes of a neighbour, named Hanaway, (produced and deposed to by Saunders, as Mr. Bell's property.)
Barnwell Hanaway. The prisoner came to lodge at my house about seven weeks ago; he was sick, and desired that I might sell these boots and shoes; I sold them for seven shillings; the prisoner said they were his property.
Prisoner. Ask Mr. Saunders if it was possible for me to get into the place?
Saunders to the question. I thought he could not, and said so on his former trial. (See No 25, in this mayoralty.) but I imagine he did get in, or set somebody else to go in.
Prisoner's defence.
I bought the boots and shoes of a man in Hackney-road, but I do not know him.

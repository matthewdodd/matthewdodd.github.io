            . On the third of March I lost a deal box full of linen out of my room when I was out [she mentions all the goods in the indictment]. They were all in a deal box, except the gowns. I know not who stole them.

             lodges in a room in my house. She goes out to work at Mr. Say's an upholsterer on Ludgate-hill. She came home at two o'clock to dinner on the third of March; and as she had no fire she dined with me, and went out afterwards to her work. She said, she had locked her door, and had the key in her pocket. After that, I was going into my parlour, I missed my key out of my kitchen door. I looked up stairs. I saw the stair-case lighter than usual. I went up and saw Mrs. Meakins's door wide open, and the lid of a box half off, and one box gone. I went out, and asked my neighbours, if they had seen any body carry out any thing? A man said, he saw the prisoner come down stairs. The prisoner had been with me the forenoon that day. I was in my cellar, and heard the street door open very softly. I came up as fast as I could, and met the prisoner coming out of my kitchen. I said, what do you want? He said, is Mrs. Daniel at home? I said, go up and see. He went up; this was about 11 in the forenoon. I staid in the entry till he came down again. I did not like his looks. I was told by my lodgers above, that he did not ask for Mrs. Daniel, but for Mrs. Thompson, when he was above. The things, all but the gowns, were found in his apartment [ produced in court, and deposed to].

            . The woman that the prisoner lives with (named

            ) works for me. She delivered the things here produced to me that night, when they were carrying him to the Compter. I had asked her to let me search the room; and when I saw the things, I knew them: he was taken in the room.

            . I was with

                  Daniel 
               



             at the prisoner's lodgings, when the woman that he lives with delivered these things to her. She said the prisoner brought them there.

            . I know the prisoner at the bar brought a box of things into the room where he and I live. I delivered it to Mrs. Daniel.

            . I was going into my house in Fleur-de-lis court, Black Friers, that day about five minutes after two o'clock there were some boys quarreling at their marbles; I turned about to look at them, and saw a man (I believe it to be the prisoner) come out of Mrs. Smith's house with a box under his arm, and a bundle on the top of that.
Q. Suppose you was obliged to swear he was or was not the man?
Brintal. I should swear he was the man, though I never saw him before.

            . The prisoner lodged at my house on the third of March. About three o'clock he came in with a brown box under his arm.
Q. Where do you live?

                  Smith 
               



            . I live in Whitecross-street. I met him in the entry at the street door; he seemed to be in a hurry; he hung down his head, and never spoke.
Prisoner's Defence.
I cannot help it; if they have a mind to swear I had the things, they may swear; I cannot help it.
For the Prisoner.

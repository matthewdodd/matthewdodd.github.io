            . I am one of the pew openers at Hackney church


, on the 22nd of January in the afternoon the prisoner came into the church, and while I was seating some ladies, she went into Mr. Bridges pew; I told her she must not sit there if the ladies came they would be offended. When service was over, the prisoner was the first person that went out; I went after her: I saw the prisoner searched, the bible was taken out of her pocket.

            . I apprehended the prisoner; I told her for what I stopped her, for taking the bible out of Mr. Bridges pew, she said, she had it not about her; going along she took the bible out of her pocket, and gave it to me. I produce the bible.
MISS KNAPP. I sit in Mr. Bridges pew at church, Mr. Bridges is my step father, he purchased this bible for me, it is my bible, it was left in my pew at church.
Prisoner's Defence. I am not right in my mind at times, I am in the habit of taking a bible with me to church; I did not take the bible away with intent of keeping it.

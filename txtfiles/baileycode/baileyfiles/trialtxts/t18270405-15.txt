MR. RICHARD NELME. I am an oil broker
, and live in Lower Thames-street. On the 23d of March I was at the corner of Cree-lane, Leadenhall-street


, going home, and heard a gentleman say, "I have caught you at last," and on my turning round he had hold of the prisoner, who had my handkerchief in his hand - it was safe ten minutes before; he was within two feet of me, and pretended to be drunk.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Lothbury. I was in Leadenhall-street, and saw Mr. Nelme looking in at a window; I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of his pocket; I seized him, took it out of his hand, and said, "I have caught you at last;" I had seen him try several gentlemen's pockets, which made me watch him.

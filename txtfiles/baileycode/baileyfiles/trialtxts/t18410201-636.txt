MARY PEATLING
. I am the wife of William Peatling; we live in Caro-line-street, Stepney, and let ready-furnished lodgings. The prisoner came and took a lodging for a constancy on the 28th of November, he took it by the week, and stated that he worked at Limehouse—he was only there one night—he left on the 29th—as he did not return in the afternoon, I went into the room, and missed the articles stated—I have never seen them since.





WILLIAM SLADDEN
 (police-constable K 50.) I took the prisoner on another charge, on the 31st of December, at the East India Docks—I mentioned this robbery to him—he said he knew nothing about it.





JAMES MALIK
 (police-constable K 99.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—theprisoner is the person—I was at the trial.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Fourteen Years. (There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

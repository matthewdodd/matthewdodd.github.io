HENRY WILDING
. I am in the service of Charles Daniel Loveday, a pawnbroker, in Calthorpe-place, Gray's Inn-road—we had some handkerchiefs hanging at our door—I received information, and missed six—I went round another way, and met the prisoner—he threw down these handkerchiefs—they are ray master's.

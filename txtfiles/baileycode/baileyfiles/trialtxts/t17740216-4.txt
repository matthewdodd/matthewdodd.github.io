            . I lost on the 17th of January a cloth coat, waistcoat, and breeches, out of a drawer in my bureau, at Mr. Underwood's in Bloomsbury


. I was told the prisoner was taken with the goods upon him; he had taken a lodging in the same house; I did not see him while I lodged there.

            . On the 18th of January I was sent for to Mr. Underwood's, and was told Mr. Shingle had lost some clothes. On the Friday following the prisoner came into my shop, and said he had a suit of clothes to sell, and brought these clothes; from the description I had received of these clothes, I thought those offered by the prisoner were Mr. Shingle's; I asked him a good many questions about them; he asked two guineas for them; I suspected him, and detained him; I sent for Mr. Shingle, and he owned the clothes. (They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner called his brother, and his father, who gave him a good character.

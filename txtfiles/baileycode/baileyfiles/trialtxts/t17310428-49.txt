             depos'd, That her Husband living in Service at London, she dwels with a Sister at St. Neot's in Huntingdonshire ; that thither the Prisoner came, telling her, he came from her Husband, and he would have her come up to London, he having provided a Room for her; that he gave her so many Tokens of an intimate Acquaintance with her Husband, that she did not doubt of the Reality of his Errand, and therefore concluded to go; the Prisoner would have had her come away with him, but she said, she could not do that, but she would come by the Waggon the next Journey, and her Husband and the Prisoner (as he told her) were to receive her at Highgate. That she did come up accordingly, but her Husband not meeting her there, she came to the Inn with the Waggon, where the Prisoner came to receive her, in order to conduct her (as he pretended) to her Husband, and calling a Coach, took her with a Box and Bundle to a House near Sir John Oldcastle's, the Room her Husband, as she expected, provided for her, and where she expected to see him, but not finding him there, was very uneasy, and not being satisfied till she saw him, the Prisoner persuaded her to be quiet, telling her, he had told the Landlady she was his Wife, and would have had her be content to live with him; but not prevailing, and she resolute to find out her Husband, he took her out, pretending to carry her to Hanover-square in search of him; he carried her about all the Afternoon from one place to another, solliciting her to live with him, for if she would give all the World it was impossible to see him that Night; but as he was leading her about up one Street, and down another, till it was almost dark, in Chick-lane she accidentally met her Husband, and overjoy'd, crying, here's Joseph; the Prisoner ran away, and she not knowing the Town, did not know were to find the Room where she had left her Clothes; but going next Day to the Inn, met with a Man who had heard where he had bid the Coachman drive to, so going to the place to find her Clothes, the Landlady told her, her Husband had been there the Night before, and taken away some of them to carry to her, and going up Stairs she found her Box broken open, and all her Clothes gone, but what was worth little.

            , the Landlady, depos'd, That the Prisoner took a Room (as he said) for his Wife, who was to come out of the Country, and lay there two Nights, as he said, to Air the Sheets, and when he went out, said, he was going to fetch his Wife, and brought the Prosecutor, as his Wife, about 2 o'Clock; that they carried up the Box and Bundle, and stay'd but a little while in the Room, and she heard some high Words pass between them, as she thought, not to be expected from Man and Wife that were but just met together after a long Absence; but they soon coming both down, went out together, he telling her, they were going to Hanover-square, and desired him not to stayout late; that about 7 o'Clock he came by himself, desir'd a Candle, and told her, he had left his Wife at a Mantua-makers, and she wanted a Gown which she would alter while she was there, and carried out a great Bundle with him; most of the Goods were produced in Court, and found where he had pawned them; and the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him

 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of October, I cart, value 1l. 10s.; and I ass, price 1l. 10s.; the goods and property of 



Robert White.






ROBERT WHITE
. I live in Nightingale-street, Portman-market. On Thursday, the 18th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I left my donkey and cart in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and went into a potato-shop—I came out in five minutes, and missed them—I met the prisoner

about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, in the Uxbridge-road—I stopped him, and took my donkey away from him—I asked how he came by it—he said he gave 1s. for it—I asked him where the cart was—he said he did not know anything about the cart nor the harness—I took him up Oxford-street—he said, if I did not give him in charge, he would show me where the cart was—I made him no answer—he took me to Lowndes'-square, Chelsea, and showed me where it was, and I gave him in charge—the harness was with it.





WILLIAM CORNISH
, (police-constable B 85.) I took the prisoner in charge—he said he bought the donkey for 1s. of a big boy, and left the big boy in care of the cart while he went to sell the donkey, but he had not got far enough with it before the prosecutor took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not steal it at all—there was nobody with me—I have no father or mother—the donkey had been standing there—I laid hold of the reins, and pulled it along—I only meant to have a ride—I did not know where the cart was.




GUILTY
.* Aged 10.—


Transported for Ten Years to the Juvenile Prison. The prisoner was recognised as having been at least twenty times in custody.

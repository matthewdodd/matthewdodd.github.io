            . On the 9th of September I was out with my milk pails in Princes-street, Oxford-street


, about half-past three o'clock - I put down my pails at a door where I received a penny, which I put into a little tin can, in which I had the money stated - the prisoner and two other boys were standing by at the time - I went on to the next door and the lady told me to go in with the bill; I did so and while I was inside, I heard the money rattle - I ran out and saw the prisoner running with the little can in which the money was; I pursued him; he dropped it at the corner of Regent-street and Oxford-street - I took it up and kept it till the policeman came with the prisoner; the money tumbled out when he let it fall; one shilling and some of the copper was lost, but the rest was there - this is it.
THOMAS WINKUP. I saw the prisoner run, and throw the can down.

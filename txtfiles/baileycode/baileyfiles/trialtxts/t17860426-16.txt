             sworn.
I was at work when this happened, I am a taylor, I heard a scuffle in the entry with my mistress and the prisoner, I came directly, and when I came out, he was discoursing with her in the entry, I collared him and threw him on his back, then he put his hand in his pocket, and I caught him by the hand for fear he should do me a mischief; and he took out his hand and a silver salt along with it; I kept him there till assistance came, I gave the salt to my wife.
Did you see any body else in the entry? - When I took him off the ground, and assistance came, the snuff-box was under him; I saw nothing else but one salt which I took from him, and the snuff box was under him; the constable has them.

These things were delivered to me by Mrs. Manwaring. ( The salt and the snuffbox deposed to, and the pepper box, and the other salt.)
Prisoner. Here is one Mrs. Bellamy whom I knew, I went up to ask her whether she could make me a shirt, and I knocked at the door, and two men came out at a door just by, and almost knocked me down stairs, and when they run down they dropped something, and I picked up a salt; I bid them search me.
What are you? - I have worked in the markets these thirteen years in the portering way.
Who for? - I have worked for Mr. Heath, he was here a little while ago, and for Mr. Cook, he is here, he knows me.
Court to Prosecutrix. Who is this Mrs. Bellamy? - She was a lodger, but she was out a nurse keeping, she does not know the gentleman, and I never saw him before in my life.
Prisoner. I would have got Mrs. Bellamy, but I could not go myself to fetch her.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

Lucas and Spence were the original proprietors; but Messrs. Casenneuve and Co gave me orders to deliver it to the lighterman; he went afloat from the dock; I am positive to him.

I am a waiting waterman at Tower-wharf; about six weeks ago, I was rowing from pickle herring-stairs, a-stern on the second tier; and one 
               
                  William
                   Rankin
               



             bid me get an old boat and follow him, and in a luggage boat, where this 
               
                  William
                   Rankin
               



             was, there was some matted luggage; in Rogers's road; I thought it was stock-fish; I asked him to let me have a good one; I walked inside the craft, and he on the outside; I carried the boat to him, I first met with the lug astern, across the second tier; I walked across the craft, and he called me, and gave me some whalebone into the boat, and he says, row ashore at Crows-nest wharf; he takes a porter and puts this into a sack; he says to me, if you will go up to Steele's I will come to you; I said, no, I will go to Browne's; he came in and gave me 3 s. 6 d. I thanked him: Rankin was in the luggage boat, when he first called to me; and there was also, apparently to me, Mr. Simpkins's servant; that is the young man at the bar, and I am very sorry to see him here; it was about an hour and a half, I thought myself greatly paid, the lad went away with the luggage boat, after this was taken out of her; I do not know how many pieces there were; on last Saturday was three weeks, I was standing at Tower-wharf-place; and 
               
                  William
                   Rankin
               



             came to me and asked me when the tide would ebb, says he I will ensure you 4 s. or 5 s. I rowed him down to Deptford, I made the boat fast; we had two or three pots of porter and some bread and cheese, this was about twelve or one in the day, he came out, and said follow me up the reach; he went up in the luggage boat, I followed him in twenty minutes, I boarded him twice, and he said not yet, I will call you when I want you; he rowed this luggage boat to Mr. Saunders's road, Wapping; I went along side of him, and he gave me some bone in the boat, and bid me row up to St. Catherine's; the prisoner was in the luggage boat with Rankin; we landed the bone, and he called two porters to take it away, he says to me you go with the porter, and this Will Rankin and a stout lusty man was wrangling about some money; then I came to my own boat; I do not know what became of the prisoner; I parted with him at Wapping; when Rankin took the whalebone out of the luggage boat, I only saw the long matted parcels.

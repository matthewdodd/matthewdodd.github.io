EDWARD DONALD

was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of October, 2 pairs of shoes, value 16s.; and 1 shoe, value 2s.; the goods of 



William Newsom.






WILLIAM NEWSOM
. I lost some shoes and boots out of my shop on the 26th of October, about half-past seven o'clock—my shop is about a quarter of a mile from Croom's-hill—I ran down the street on missing them, and went to the station-house—somebody must have got into my shop to get them—I was in the shop—they must have opened the door and crawled in.





CHARLES NICHOLLS
 (police-constable R 164.) I saw the prisoner near the spot where the coat was concealed, about half-past seven o'clock or twenty minutes to eight—I jumped up and laid hold of him, and a pair of high shoes fell from him—I saw his companion go twenty or thirty yards from the spot, and go round the corner of a wall and stoop—I afterwards received information that these shoes were stolen—the prisoner denied that the shoes fell from him, but I am certain they did—I found the others behind the wall where I saw his companion stoop.


Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the slides—he took me ten minutes before he found them—he went and kicked up the leaves with his foot, and said I had dropped them.

Witness. No, I found them directly I laid hold of him—I kicked about to see if there was any thing else—I afterwards took a lantern, and found the rest where his companion had stooped.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years to the Juvenile Prison.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

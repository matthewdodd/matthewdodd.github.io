ANN BATTAM.
 I live with my husband at 41, Oxford-terrace, Paddington, the prosecutrix is my daughter. On 9th Nov. we were in Summers-place, at the back of our house—she had a purse in her hand, but I did not know it at the time—the prisoner came up, and in an instant threw her with great violence into the road—her head struck the curb-stone—I was not aware he had snatched at the purse—he dragged her up again by it, shook her, and ran away—I afterwards saw the purse in her hand—the tassels were all torn to pieces—I had been into a shop with her—it had the tassels on then.





CHARLOTTE LOUISA BATTAM.
 On 9th Nov. I was walking with my mother in Summers-place—my purse was twisted round my finger, and the tassels came together—the prisoner came quickly on me, pressed against me, laid hold of my purse, and threw me down—he pulled me up again by the purse—my mother screamed—the prisoner ran away—I ran a little way after him—he did not get the purse—the tassels were gone off it—they were safe on it when he came up—they were worth about 1s. 6d.





CHARLES ANSTEAD.
 I saw the prisoner struggling with the young lady.





WILLIAM JONES.
 I saw the prisoner running in Summers-mews—I stopped him, and delivered him to another person—he was given in charge.

            . I am servant to Mr. 
               
                  Harry 
                  Phillips
               



            , and had the care of his house, which is Brandenburgh college, at Fulham, Middlesex


. On the night of the 2d of April I locked up the house all safe - the next morning I went to open it, and found the door open and a chair against it; the shutters were put too, but the padlock which I had put on at night was broken off and gone; I looked in the kitchen, found the drawers all open, and the china and glass gone, which I had seen right the night before - I missed the chimney-glass from over the drawing-room fire-place, where I had laid the fire the day before; this iron bar laid across the fire-place, it appears to be the same the house was broken with.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any other servant in the house? A. No one slept in the house- I locked it outside, and went away; Mr. Phillips did not live in the house at all - it was left in my care: Mr. Phillips makes use of it at different times - he frequently drank tea there, and used those glasses when he was there.

            . I know the two prisoners - they live at Hammersmith: I went to their house with a search warrant, on the 3rd of April, with a man of the name of Hallett and Mr. Phillips - I went up stairs, and was going into the room on the first floor, but was prevented by John Goodrick and his wife, who said there was a woman who had lain in but a few days - I said I must insist upon it; they begged me to wait a few minutes while they got the room fit for a man to go into - I placed a man at the door, and went up stairs; I found no property relating to this indictment; I came down again, and with very great reluctance they let me go into the room - in fact I was obliged to force my way in; I proceeded to search every part till I came to the bed: I lifted up one corner of the bed, and saw the mattress - I then went to the other corner; I saw nothing there - as I was putting it down again, I saw a small hole in the straw mattress, I put my hand in, and felt a plate or a dish; I pulled it out - Mr. Phillips claimed it; I put in my hand, and found I believe, seven, which I put into Mr. Phillip's hand, who identified them; John Goodrick took up the plates and dishes, smashed them on the floor, and said "There you b-rs, now can you swear to them;"I called for assistance - John Goodrich got the poker, and said he would smash my b-y brains out; Robert Goodrick then ran up, passed my man on the stairs, and caught up another poker - John said "Come on Bob, let us beat their h-y brains out, if they do not get out of the house;" I got out, and sent for three of my own men - the prisoners were then apprehended, I found a dark lantern and a cutlas, but nothing more relating to this indictment.
Cross-examined. Q. Robert did not come up till there was a row? A. As soon as I called for my assistant, Robert ran up, and passed him; I believe John is married, and has one or two children - these are the broken plates and dishes.
MR. PHILLIPS. I am son of 
               
                  Harry 
                  Phillips
               



            . I was with Palmer; what he has stated is correct - there was a woman in bed.
Cross-examined. Q. Is there any private marks on these plates and dishes? A. No; I was perfectly aware this was my father's property, when it was taken from the bed.

                  HALLETT
               



            . I was charged to aid and assist Palmer to search the house; what he has stated is correct.

             re-examined. It was a large sized glass; it filled the fire place - this is a fruit-dish that matches with what were taken; I think we lost five dishes, nine or ten plates, and some glasses.

            's Defence. They say it is a dwelling-house, when I know the house has been locked up for months and months, and not a soul has been seen there, but the woman has come and unlocked it in the morning, to give it air; it is a summer-house, about four hundred yards from the dwelling-house - I have had that dark-lantern for many years; I use it in the boat, to sort my fish at Billingsgate, in the winter.

            . There was another indictment against the prisoners, which was not tried.

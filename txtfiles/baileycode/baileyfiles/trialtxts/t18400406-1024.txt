 and 




THOMAS FISHER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
9th of March, 3 loaves of bread, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



John Sweetland; and that Wildy had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM RENEY
. I am a baker, living with John Sweetland, in Howland-street, Tottenham Court-road. I went out with my bread, on the 9th of March, about a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning—I left my basket at the corner of Francis-street for about five minutes—when I returned I saw the prisoners on the other side of the way—I went to serve another customer, and while doing so, I saw Wildy give Fisher a handkerchief—he stood on the other side while Fisher took the bread, and wrapped it in the handkerchief—they were then taken into custody—Fisher ran away—Wildy followed him close behind, but did not run.





WILLIAM MATTHEW
 (police-constable E 65.) I took the prisoners, and received the loaves.





HENRY COMPTON
 (police-constable D 87.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner Wildy's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person—I was a witness.

WILDY—


GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

FISHER—



GUILTY. Aged 11.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.
—


Transported for Seven Years.—Isle of Wight.

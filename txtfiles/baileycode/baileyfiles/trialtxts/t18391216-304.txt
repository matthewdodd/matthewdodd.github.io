CAROLINE FARTHING
. I am the wife of Joshua Farthing, a tailor, who lives in Goswell-street, St. Luke's. On the 12th of December the prisoner and another man came to the shop—they asked for a coat—as I turned to call the shopman to suit them the prisoner went behind the counter, took these handkerchiefs off the shelf, and put them into his pocket—I went into the shop again, looked on the shelf, and saw they were gone—I told the shopman—he went after him, and I saw no more of him till he was in custody—these are the handkerchiefs—(looking at them.)





JOHN GULLEFORD
. I was called, I went out, and called "Stop-thief"—the prisoner was running up Noble-street—I followed him—he was stopped, and gave me the handkerchiefs from his outside pocket—he had got a quarter of a mile from the shop.

Prisoner. I hope you will have mercy.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

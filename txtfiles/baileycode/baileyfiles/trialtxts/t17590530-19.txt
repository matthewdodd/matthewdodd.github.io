            . I am a Watch-maker: looking from my window, I observ'd the prisoner with a silver spoon, among some timbers, indeavouring to break it; I went and told Mr Hooper of it; we went and took this spoon from him, and took him before justice St Lawrance: the spoon having been advertis'd by the prosecutor, he was sent for, and it was deliver'd to him.
Mr Hooper confirm'd the last evidence's account. The spoon produc'd in court, and depos'd to.

I found that spoon on a dunghill.

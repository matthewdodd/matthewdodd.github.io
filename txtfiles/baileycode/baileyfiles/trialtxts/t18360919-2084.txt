JOSEPH TOMKINS
 was indicted

for stealing on the 
20th of August one set of harness, value 4l. 10s., the goods of 



Charles Westlake.






CHARLES WESTLAKE
. I am a butcher. I have a shop in Newport-market, which I locked up, on Saturday, the 20th of August, and left a set

of harness there—I was there about two o'clock in the day, all was safe then—I did not go again, but my boy went to do up the horse—next morning a man came and said my horse was in the street—I went and found the door had been broken open—this is my harness which was missing—my boy is not here.

Cross-examined by Mr. THOMAS. Q. What is his name? A. Darey we call him—I do not know what his other name is—I did not swear before the Magistrate that I saw it at five o'clock—if I said five or four o'clock, that was not true—when the boy came home I asked for the key of the door, and he gave it to me—for any thing I know he may have taken the harness and given it to prisoner—there is no mark on it, but it is mine.





JOHN LEWIS
. I made this harness for the prosecutor.





BENJAMIN CATMULL
. I am an officer. I saw the prisoner on that Saturday night, at ten o'clock, at the end of Shoe-lane, on Holborn hill—this harness was set down by the end of the church wall in this bag—the prisoner was standing by the side of it—I asked him what he had got there—he said he had got a parcel, and was waiting for a person—I took him to the station, and then I saw it was harness—I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said a person gave it him to carry.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a goldsmith and jeweller, and live in Leicester-fields


. As I was standing in my shop, on the 17th of August, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I heard a rattling in the shew-glass, and bid my servant see what it was: he ran to the door, and we perceived the shew-glass was drawn up a considerable heighth; they had lifted the drawer up, and drawn the board of rings out: they drop'd about twenty rings in the shew-glass, and I lost fourteen or fifteen: they took the board away. I secured the shew-glass, and looked after the thieves, but could find nothing of them: there was also a box of silver clasps for shoes, and buttons and studs, and such things that were taken away. On the Tuesday following, Millar came to my house, and said, Sir, you was robbed on Saturday last: if you will get a proper officer, and come with me, I will shew you the thieves, and you may take some of the things on them; he told me he was one concerned in the robbery. I got an officer, and we went into a public-house to get some more help, as Millar told us there were eight concerned in the robbery. I desired him to set their names down, which he did. After we had got a watchman, and two or three others, we went into a house in the Coach yard, St. Giles's: Millar went in first; the constable, myself, and another followed: there was a man; he said, this is one of them, his name is 
               
                  William 
                  Davis 
               



            . He immediately imagined Millar had trepann'd them, and he said, since Millar has impeached me, I will tell you of all the rest. I said, I wish you would, I will be as favourable to you as I can: accordingly we took Davis to St. Ann's Round-house, and Millar to St. Giles's, that they might not be together. Davis told me there were eight concerned in the robbery, and gave me the same names as Millar had done, which were

                  Tom
               


             the footman, and 
               
                  Henry 
                  Palmerston 
               



            ; there were

                  Daniel 
               



             and

            , that are not yet taken, these made up the eight. When we carried Davis to the Round-house, he seemed very much vexed that Millar had used him in that manner, and said he would give me an account of all the rest. I said, if you will any way assist in taking them, I will endeavour to be as favourable to you as possible: we went into another house in St. Giles's, and there found the boy 
               
                  Henry 
                  Palmerston 
               



            ; we took him to the Round-house, and Davis said he could tell us where two of the rings were: we went, and Davis got in at a window, and brought out two rings, which were delivered to me. 
               
                  John 
                  Simmonds 
               



             was in bed with a girl, in one room; and as we were breaking open the door, he jumped out at the window, naked as he was: Davis said, this is Simmonds, and the girl acknowledged it was; so we carried his cloaths to the Round-house. I was informed two or three days afterwards, that he was in custody: Till was in prison before Millar came to me. We went in pursuit of them to several houses, and took Simmonds three or four days afterwards: then I was sent for, and bound over to prosecute. There was a chimney-sweeper said, he saw two of the rings in Till's possession: Mr. Welch bound him over as an evidence, and he ran away, but I am told is since taken up for another robbery. Millar delivered up several of the clasps that he had in his own custody, and Davis gave me two gold rings: I can swear to the clasps, and I think I could swear to the rings; but rings are so much alike, that I would not chuse to swear to them: here is my workman's mark on them.
Q. from Davis. He says I had two gold rings; Whether I had or no?
Fisher. He said I can tell you where two gold rings are: he took me to the house where they were; I think they said they took down a lath out of the cicling to get at them.

            ; they seeing what we were doing, they stayed and helped us. I lifted up the shew-glass, and took out the box with clasps and buttons; 
               
                  William 
                  Till 
               



             came behind me, put his hand in, and took out a card of Mocho buttons; I went and laid the box down by the iron bars, and came back, and saw them very busy: I went back to the box, and took the buttons out of the box, and put them in my pocket. When I came back again, 
               
                  Tom
               


             the footman was taking the rings out of the shew-glass, and Simmonds was holding the thing up: when they had got the rings, they run off as hard as they could; they ran against a woman, and dropped one or two of the rings, which I heard was found that night. I took Lebat and Daniel (who are not yet taken) into my room, and we shared the buttons and studs equally together: they went both away. The next morning I went to the Coach-yard, St. Giles's; the woman's name who keeps the house is Ayres: I found there 
               
                  William 
                  Davis

             the footman,

                  Palmerstone 
               



            . This Mrs. Ayres came in with the rings; she took a brass ring from off her finger, and changed for one of the gold ones: she had carried them to sell, and they said they were not gold, so she brought them back again, and 
               
                  Harry 
                  Palmerstone 
               



             believing they were not gold, offered two of the rings for Half a Crown, which I gave him for them; we had each two rings apiece, and then there were four that could not be divided, because there were five in the gang, so we agreed to sell them, and divide the money: Davis went to sell them, and he happened to shew the brass ring to a woman, who he told us lived in Thieving-lane; and she said, Don't make a fool of me, that have made fools of thousands; he offered to shew her the others, but she would not see them. I went away, and gave the rings to my wife to sell; she got 7 s. 6 d. for them: I also gave her the studs and buttons; she got for some 2 s. 6 d. for some 2 s. and for some 18 d. not knowing they were stolen. The robbery was done on Saturday night, between the hours of nine and ten; and on the Tuesday I made the discovery to Mr. Fisher. My reason for going to Mr. Fisher was, I had been taken up, and put in prison, on false reports; and as no indictment could be found against me, I was cleared. I surrendered myself up, to get from the gang, and get my bread honestly, that was my only reason.
Q. Did you never see these people after that morning you was with them at the Coach-yard?
Millar. No, I did not, till they came into my room.
Q. As it was but about three days from the time of the robbery, to your making the discovery to Mr. Fisher, what passed in that time?
Millar.

             came to my house, and shewed my wife their share of the rings.
Q. How long was it after Till was taken up, that you went to Mr. Fisher?
Millar. I believe it was about two days after he was taken up; a very short time after the robbery. When I surrendered, I was put in St. Giles's Round-house: I was out several times, for taking the prisoners, and one night the constable left me, and I went to the Round-house myself, at ten o' clock at night.

             the footman and William Davis brought two rings to me, in my apartment, to know if they were gold? I told them I thought they were. About a week before this affair, I saw

                  Till 
               



             and my husband sharing money, but upon what occasion, I don't know: my husband had two rings, which he said he bought: I sold them for 7 s. 6 d.
Q. What trade is your husband?
S. Millar. He is a smith.
Q. Did you know any thing of any buttons and clasps?
S. Millar. I sold them; they were children's clasps and buttons.
Q. Do you know any thing of the other prisoners?
S. Millar. I know 
               
                  William 
                  Till 
               



             and Simmonds, and I think I have seen Palmerston once, but he did not stay two minutes.

Q. Was your husband at home or abroad the night this robbery was committed?
S. Millar. He was abroad, and a man came home with him I had never seen before, and a boy. which I believe is Palmerston.
Q. Do you know what they were about when they came home?
S. Millar. I do not.
Q. from Davis. Whether she saw me that night or the next day?
S. Millar. I saw him the very night they were taken up.

            . I keep a silversmith's shop, in Tothill-street, Westminster. Millar came to me, on the 19th or 20th of August, with a man and a boy; they offered two gold rings for sale; I weighed them, and they came to 6 s. I did not look in their faces that brought the rings, but it was 
               
                  Tom
               


             the footman, I think by his face: Millar came next day, and shewed me some clasps; I said I would have nothing to do with them, as I suspected they were not honestly come by.

            . I went at the desire of the prosecutor with Millar to get the things.
Q. to Millar. What were Davis and Palmerston doing the time of the robbery?
Millar. They were keeping the people at a Wheelbarrow in discourse.
Till's Defence.
What the evidence says against me, I know no more of than the child unborn.

Davis's Defence.
The night this affair was done, I was at home; and all that day and the day before bad with an ague and fever, not being able to get out of bed; when I was taken, I was so bad I could hardly stand: the prosecutor knows what a condition I was in.
Prosecutor. He was certainly very ill when I took him.
Palmerston's Defence,
I am between 13 and 14 years old: I was coming out of the Opera, in the Haymarket, with my link in my hand; I saw two rings lying, I took and put them in my pocket: the next morning Millar came up to our house, and gave me half a crown for them; he gave them to his wife, as he told me.
Erkenn's Defence.
I know nothing of the affair: my friends live in the country, and I have been in London but a little while.
Simmonds's Defence.
I never saw any of the rings, or Millar, before in my life.

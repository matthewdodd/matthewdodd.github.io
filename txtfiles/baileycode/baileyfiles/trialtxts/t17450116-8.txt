                  Sherron 
               



            . On Thursday night last I was going down Bucklers Bury


, I felt a hand in my pocket, and felt my handkerchief drawn out. I took hold of the Prisoner directly, and charged him with it; he said he had it not. I searched him, and he had it not, but Mr. Smith's man went into the street and found it. I am sure the Prisoner is the person that took it, for there was no body else near.

            . I was out at Mr. Smith's door, and saw the Prosecutor coming along, and the Prisoner just at his heels, Mr. Sherron charged him with taking his handkerchief, and it was found about a yard from the door.

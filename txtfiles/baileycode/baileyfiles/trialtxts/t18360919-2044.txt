SAMUEL CLARKE

GEORGE CHIDGZEY
 (police-constable C 74.) Between three and four o'clock on the 9th of September, I was in Holborn, and saw the two prisoners and another man behind the prosecutor—I saw them get close round him—I followed them chose, and looked over Bennett's shoulder, and saw him take this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he handed it back for Carroll to take, but I took it out of his hand, and took them both—they had walked about fifteen yards together—I did not see them speak to each other—they were walking close behind the gentleman, Bennett was close behind the prosecutor, and the other two were covering him—Carroll appeared to be ready to receive it—he had his hand by his side—the other made his escape.

Bennett. There was a man in front of me—he picked the gentleman's pocket, and flung the handkerchief on the ground—the officer took me and this one, and said we were with him—he saw the other man running down Creed-lane at the time.

Carroll. I had my hands in my pockets at the time I was taken—I could not be accessary to the fact at all—I never took my hand out of my pocket.

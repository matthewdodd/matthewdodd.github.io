 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

CORNELIUS GRIFFITHS
. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 18th of June I was in the Mall of St. James's-park—there was a crowd of about forty persons—Bennett told me something—I felt and missed my handkerchief from my right hand pocket—I bad one similar to this now produced—I cannot swear to it.





WILLIAM BENNETT
. I am a carpenter, and live in Granby-place, Waterloo-road. On the l'8th of June I was in the Mall—there was a crowd there—I saw the prisoner standing behind the prosecutor, and saw him take this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he held it in his hand till the prosecutor caught hold of his collar, and then he threw it down—it was given to the policeman in my presence.





THOMAS POWELL
 (police-constable A 57.) This handkerchief was delivered to me with the prisoner—the prosecutor was by—I asked him if he had lost any thing—he said, "Yes, a handkerchief—I said, "Should you know it again?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Is this your handkerchief?"—he said, "Yes, and I can swear to it"—he said the same at the station—this is the same handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I never had it in my hand.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17—

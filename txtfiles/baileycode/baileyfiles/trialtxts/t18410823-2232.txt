WILLIAM WELLHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of August, 1 pair of boots, value 9d., the goods of 



George Ruby; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH RUBY
. I am the wife of George Ruby—we live in Arthur-street, Chelsea. On the 20th of August the prisoner came and begged at our house—I told him we had nothing for him—he came again in the afternoon to buy a file—when he left, I missed a pair of boots from the shop—I called him back, and said, "My boy, you have got a pair of boots"—he put down his basket, and I saw these boots in it, which are ours—he ran away.





TIMOTHY WELLS
 (police-constable V 83.) I took the prisoner—I asked him if be had stolen the boots—he denied it—in going to the station, he said he had stolen them.

Prisoner. The woman called me back to buy a halfpenny-worth of pears; another boy told me to go and steal an old pair of boots, and put them into the basket.





HENRY KIMBER
 (police-sergeant V 20.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried.

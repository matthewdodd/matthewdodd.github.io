            . I live with Mrs. Mary Smith in Beaufort-row, Chelsea


 - she is a widow
. On the 30th of March, about eleven o'clock, as I cleaned the kitchen window, I heard the back door shut, and saw the prisoner going out; he asked if we wanted any lemons, and he had one in his hand - I told him to go round to the back door and wait: he said, No, he would not wait there - I went out of the area, and he went out of the gate and ran; I ran and caught his coat - he struggled with me, and got away, leaving part of his coat in my hand; Mr. Hall took him, and took from his basket two tea-spoons, one silver and one pewter - they are my mistress', and I had seen them at nine o'clock that morning, in the kitchen - I have seen the prisoner selling lemons.
Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. He did not run away immediately. A. As soon as I got out of the area, he came towards me - I said, "Go round to the back door," he said, "No, I will wait here" - he then went out of the gate; when I went to him he ran.

            , who is a linendraper
. I remember the prisoner had a piece of cloth under his arm; he was going along the street; one Mr. Ward called upon me, and told me the prisoner had taken these things from my master; I tripped up his heels and took the cloth from him. (Produced and deposed to.)
Mr. Ward. I am a packer: passing by Mr. Jones's shop I saw the prisoner take this cloth from the bulk.

I saw it upon the ground; I picked it up expecting to get a reward for it. I have some friends but they are not here, they are in the Borough.

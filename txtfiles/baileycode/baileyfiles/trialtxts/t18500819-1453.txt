MR. PLATT
conducted the Prosecution.






ANNA THOMPSON
. I am the wife of Thomas Thompson, a bricklayer, of 17, Old-street-road—he was out of the way early in June, and I locked up the house and went away to my sister's, and was confined there—I went to the house and found it safe about a fortnight before this happened, and locked it up again—when I went again I found marks on the door; it had been broken open—the passage was full of things—I missed a bed, bolster, pillow-cases, and other things—these things(produced) are my husband's, and are worth more than 5l.—the catch of the door was broken, but the door was closed again.





THOMAS MAVEETY
 (policeman, N 211). On Monday, 8th July, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in the Kingsland-road with a bundle—I asked him what it contained—he said, "Some blankets, tumblers, and other things"—I asked where he got them—he said, "At a sale-shop at the back of Shoreditch church"—he afterwards said be bought them of a woman in a skittle-ground at the back of Shoreditch church—I took him, and found the things produced in the bundle, and in his pocket this cap and false hair, which he said he bought in Petticoat-lane—he said the tobacco-stopper was his own.





ANNA THOMPSON

re-examined. The tobacco-stopper and false hair were safe when I left—they are mine.

Prisoner's Defence. I purchased the articles.





WILLIAM FOY
 (policeman, N 5). I produce a certificate from Mr. Clark's

office—(read—Alexander Howett, convicted August 1847, confined four months)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY**

Transported for Seven Years.

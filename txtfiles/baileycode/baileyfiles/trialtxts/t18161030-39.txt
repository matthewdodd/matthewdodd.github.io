            . On the 24th of September last, I was coming along Bishopsgate-street, and opposite the London Tavern I felt something at my pocket. I turned round, but could see nobody. At the corner of Cornhill


, I felt my other pocket attacked by a person whom I had not seen before. I I put my hand to my pocket, and turned on my heel, but my handkerchief was disposed of. The prisoner was within a foot of me. I could have no doubt, but that he was the person, as there was no one near. I accused him, and he instantly 
               drew
             the handkerchief from his side pocket, and begged that I would not prosecute him, as he was a poor man. I however resisted his entreaties, and he then abused me, and declared that I was one of Vaughan's gang. To avoid his escape, I threw up his heels, and held him on the pavement, and kept him until an officer came.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

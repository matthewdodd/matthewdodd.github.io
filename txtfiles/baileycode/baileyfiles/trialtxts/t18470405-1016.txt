1016. 




GODFREY WHITE
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 watch, value 3l, the goods of 



Joseph Clements.






CYRUS SILVERWOOD.
 I am shopman to Joseph Clements, a silversmith of Oxford-street. On the 9th of Jan., about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my master's shop, and asked to look at some watches—I am sure he is the person—I showed him some, which he did not approve of—I

placed them back in the window—he went out, and pointed out one marked 3l—I took it out of the window, and showed it him—he did not approve of it, and said he should like to look at a silver-dial watch, and while my head was in the window getting him one to look at, he and the watch vanished at the same instant—I have not the least doubt he is the man.




GUILTY. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

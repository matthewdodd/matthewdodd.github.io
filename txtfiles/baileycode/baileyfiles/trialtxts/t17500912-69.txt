Ann. Peavy. I live in Chemist's-Ally, in St. Martin's-Lane


. I went out on July the 26th, and left 
               
                  Patience 
                  Leavers 
               



             in care of my house, the other prisoner was with her, they both lodged in my house. I staid about two hours. When I came back Leavers lay asleep by the side of my buroe, which stood in my kitchen. She told me, her sleeping there had done me a great deal of good, for my buroe was open. I went to look and found it so, and all my money, and a gold ring gone; there was a little cupboard in the buroe broke open, in it the money and ring before mentioned were put, the money amounted to 32 l. 6 s. 6 d. The little cupboard, and outside also were locked when I went out. I ask'd them both about my money, they denied knowing any thing of it, till we came before justice Frazier. We went to a pub lick house to see if we could get it out of either; and at last 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cole 
               



             said, that

                  Leavers 
               



             opened the buroe, gave the little cupboard a rap with her fist and it flew open, and then took the money and put it into the cellar chimney under half a peck of foot ; and after that, said, if she told, she would knock her brains out; and if she did not tell, they would set up an Oyster-stall together. The constable and a young man went and found the money in the chimney, as she had said.
This was confirmed by 
               
                  James 
                  Powel 
               



            , the constable, and

             was again indicted for 


               stealing, on the 22d of March
, one Bank of England note for the payment of 20l.
            , the property of 
               
                  
                     Edward 
                     Frowd
                  



               
             and 
               
                  
                     George

            .
MR. 
               
                  EDWARD 
                  FROWD
               



            . On the 22d of March last I sent the prisoner to pay 22l. 8s. into my banker's; among it was 20l. note - I gave it into his hand myself. He left the room, as I supposed, to go there; he entered it previous to his going out.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was on a Saturday morning, about eleven o'clock.
Q. Was it not four o'clock - A. Certainly not-it was before twelve o'clock. I did not ask him to let me see the banker's book. I did not go out of town that evening. There was money in his hands to answer any necessary purpose in the office.
MR. 
               
                  HENRY 
                  GUBBINGS
               



            . I am ledger-keeper to Messrs. Snow and Paul. There was no money paid in between the 13th and 29th of March.
MR. 
               
                  CHARLES 
                  GUBBINGS
               



            . I refer to the waste-book. There is no entry of money received on the 22d of March-there was 100l. paid on the 29th.
MR. FROWD. There was 100l. paid in on the 29th of March. I do not know who took it.
Court. Q. I thought you said you always entered the name of the person who took the money - A. I think I sent it by another person. I made the prisoner enter the 22l.
Q. If you had not seen the entry in the book should you have known that he took it - A. Yes, I should. I remember giving it to him when I received it, independently of my book.
Prisoner's Defence. The money was paid at the office. I entered it in the book-it was not paid till four o'clock. Mr. Frowd sent the boy out, and when he returned it was too late to send it to the banker's.

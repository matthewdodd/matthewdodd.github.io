EBENEZER FOX. I am an oil and colourman - I live opposite Mr. Smith's, a hatter
, at the corner of Frith-street


 and Compton-street


. On the 21st of November, about three o'clock, I saw two persons, who I believe to be the prisoners, standing at his door - I had but an indistinct view of them; one of them, who I believe was Jones, took two hats down, and walked down Frith-street - the other was close to his elbow at the time; I ran and told Mr. Smith's man two men had taken some hats - I staid in the shop while he went after them, and took the two prisoners to the watch-house; I did not see them again till Wednesday - I have no doubt they are the men.
ROBERT EWERS. I am in the employ of Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Smith
               



            . Fox gave me information - I went in pursuit, and came up with the prisoners when they got two or threestreets from my master's house; I cried Stop thief! and a person who is here stopped them; they had each of them a hat - these are the hats; they are my master's - I had not known the prisoners before.
GEORGE HALL. I heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoners, and stopped Fuz - he had a hat in his hand; he said,
"Jones did it, and I can't help it" - Jones had the other hat in his hand.
JONES -

            . Aged 22.
FUZ - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 28.

             sworn.
I live at No. 67, Rosemary-lane


; I am a cordwainer
; I lost a cloth jacket on the 19th of January; I work at home, and after I had left work I was sitting by the fire, getting my supper; the watchman comes by, calls and tells me my door was open; I immediately got up, to shut up; I had fastened it before, both latched and bolted; I immediately got up, to shut up, and saw the prisoner with the jacket and waistcoat under his arm, in my shop, in the inside the room; it was about two or three yards from the shop where I was sitting; they had been left on the counter.
How could he get in? - The top of the door is a hatch, and I suppose it was not bolted; and the under door has two bolts and a latch; I did not hear the door open at all; I had left work three quarters of an hour; the watchman alarmed me; I gave him charge of the prisoner; he had the things under his arm.

             sworn.
I am a watchman: as I was going round, crying ten o'clock, I found Mr. Cotton's door fast; as I was coming back, I pushed against the door, and found it gave way; I called to Mr. Cotton, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the property under his arm; I have kept it ever since.
(Produced and deposed to.)



               GUILTY
            . (Aged 25.)
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GROSE.

WILLIAM JACOBS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of April, 1 cask, value 1l., and 114lbs. weight of butter, value 4l. 9s., the goods of 



Joseph Wincott and another.






JOSEPH WINCOTT
. I keep a butter shop in Chiswell-street, and have one partner. On the 18th of April, a little after eight o'clock in the evening, I missed a cask of butter—I went after a man who had got it, about 200 yards from my door, and he let it fall—I cannot say that it was the prisoner.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. It was dark? A. Yes—I found my butter in Whitecross-street—I saw a man drop it—I have sold it since.





NICHOLAS MERRY
. I was coming past the prosecutor's house, and I saw the prisoner roll a cask of butter out—he lifted it up in his arms, and carried it before him for about two hundred yards—he then dropped it, and ran away—he was taken by the policeman.

Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I sell children's books and song-books about—I was out with my books then—I am quite sure I saw the prisoner do this—I was next door to the shop—I saw his. face—I followed him to Whitecross-street—I did not see him stopped—I saw him drop the butter.





EDWARD BLACKFORD
 (police-constable G 70.) I was on duty in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner pass me with the butter—I followed him—he turned into Whitecross-street, dropped the butler, and ran away, and after a smart chase of a quarter of a mile, I took him.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you lose sight of him I A. No—he turned round the houses, but I did not lose sight of him—when I took him, he said he knew nothing about it.

WILLIAM MALEY
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 sovereign, 1 shilling, and 1 sixpence; the monies of 



Ann Elizabeth Rolfe, from her person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN ELIZABETH ROLFE
. I am a servant—I live in Duke's-court, Union-street, Borough—on the 4th of Oct., at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was standing on the pavement, where there were some people looking at a man—the officer told me something—I put my hand into my pocket and missed a sovereign, a shilling, and a sixpence, which I had had safe not a minute before, wrapped in a small piece of paper—I cannot swear that I saw the prisoner.





ROBERT BRANSFORD
 (police-constable M 101.) I was on duty in Union-street, in the Borough—I saw the prisoner lift the prosecutrix's dress about a foot from the ground—I saw his hand in her pocket-hole—I watched him—one of his companions told him of it, and he left her—I went and spoke to her, and he disappeared—I took him about an hour afterwards.

Prisoner. I was going home that Saturday night, about eleven o'clock; I passed by a crowd; I was going home again, and the officer came and said I had picked a lady's pocket.





JAMES BOCKHAM
 (police-sergeant L 37.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at the Surrey Sessions—(read—Convicted 18th March, 1844, confined twenty-one days, solitary)—I know him to be the person—he has been in custody five times besides.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

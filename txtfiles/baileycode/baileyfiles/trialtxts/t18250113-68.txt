Mr. DANIEL THOMAS MALLONEY. I live in Sidmouth-place, and am a physician
. On the 17th of December, at a quarter before six o'clock in the evening I was in High-street, St. Giles's


 - my handkerchief was safe three-quarters of an hour before - it was in my outside coat pocket - I did not miss it till I wanted it, and it was gone - I saw it at the office about an hour after. I had not observed the prisoner near me.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner with two others, following two gentlemen (one of them was smaller than himself) - they were following Mr. Malloney, and trying his pocket; they went a little further, and tried again, and then went into the road - they went back into Dudley-court. I took hold of the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from his bosom - I made him run along with me, and overtook Mr. Malloney; I asked if he had lost any thing - he said yes, a handkerchief, and claimed this.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down High-street, and took notice of the two boys. I saw the handkerchief lying on the pavement; I took it up, and put it in my bosom.

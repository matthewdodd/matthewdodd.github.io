HENRY GARRETT
. I am shopman to Mr. Edward Hill, a butcher in Marchmont-street. About eight or nine o'clock, on the 18th of July, I went to a neighbour's house, and heard something—I went back to my master's, and missed a piece of beef—I had not been away more than two minutes—I saw the prisoner and a young man running away—I pursued them into Russell-square—the young man had something in a bag, it was thrown over the enclosure—I pursued him, but he escaped—when I came back, I found this beef in the bag—the prisoner had been secured in

Russell-square by the policeman—I am sure he is one of those who had been running away with the beef.





CHARLES ORRIS
. I live in Woburn-mews. I was going up Marchmont-street, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop with a piece of beef—there was a man outside with a bag, and they put the beef into it—I am sure the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner's Defence. I never took it, it was another boy. I was going along Russell-square, and the policeman laid hold of me.

            . On the 12th of November I was in Regent-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening- I did not feel any thing taken, but I heard a noise; I turned, and saw the two prisoners laying down on the ground near me; the officer had knocked them down, and had my handkerchief in his hand.
THOMAS HOBBS. I was on duty in Regent-street; I saw the two prisoners and another person with them - I had watched them, and seen them attempting several gentlemen's pockets; I said to my brother officer, "We will follow;" they attempted the prosecutor's pocket several times - Stewart took the handkerchief quite out; the other two were behind him, trying to hide him - I run them all up, knocked them all down, and fell upon them; I secured the two prisoners, and got the cap of the third one, but he escaped.
Jefferson's Defence. It is false; I never was in Stewart's company till we were taken.
STEWART -

            . Aged 16.
JEFFERSON - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 17.

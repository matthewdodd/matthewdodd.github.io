            . I always thought the prisoner to be a very honest person; she brought me a piece of silk to make her a petticoat; she said she could make her one of something cheaper, so I bought the piece of her.
Q. What did you give her for it?
A. Curtis. I gave her half a guinea for it.
Q. How did she say she came by it?
A. Curtis. She said it was a remnant, and she had it of Mr. Jones.

A. Curtis. It is dirty, and there is several spots in it; and she said he let her have it cheap (produc'd in court.)
Q. to Mr. Jones. What is the value of that piece of silk?
Jones. It cost me to the best of my remembrance 18 s. 6 d.

Q. When did you buy it?
M. Blackiter. I think it was before Christmas, but I cannot be positive.

M. Blackiter. I bought this piece of yellow silk of the prisoner.
Prosecutor. This I call yellow and white shot lutestring, it is my property.

M. Blackiter. To the best of my knowledge I gave her 3 l. 7 s. for that and some gause.

Prosecutor. That is not said in the indictment.
Prisoner. I mention this, to shew Mr. Jones trusted me to sell things.
Q. to M. Blackiter. When did you buy that piece you mentioned?
M. Blackiter. I think it was about last Christmas that the prisoner brought it to me, I think it was yellow silveret, two remnants, I bought it of her, and paid Mr. Jones for it in his own shop.
Q. to prosecutor. Did you send her with them remnants?
Prosecutor. Last year I sold a parcel of remnants as is usual at times in our shop; perhaps there might be such a thing as that, I cannot contradict that, for I gave the prisoner a gown myself.
Q. Do you remember Mrs. Blackiter paying of you.
Prosecutor. I believe she did, but I cannot remember it; I never trusted the prisoner to sell any thing to my knowledge on my own acount.

            . I am shopman to John and Henry Reeve; they are shoemakers

, and live in Leather-lane. On the 13th of March I was coming out of the kitchen into the shop, and saw the prisoner at the counter - I asked him his business; he gave me no answer, but turned round, and was going out. I asked him his business again; he gave me no answer, but ran out - I followed him to the corner of Portpool-lane, and there he dropped two pairs of shoes from under his coat; I took them up, and afterwards took him; I did not lose sight of him, but when he got to Crown-court he made his escape into a house - I got a man to stop at the door while I got a constable, and we went into the top-room; there was no furniture there; but there was a cupboard up high, and the constable found the prisoner in it - I can swear to this property.

            . I am a constable. Robinson came to me, and said a lad had taken something out of the shop. I went to an empty garret, and found the prisoner in a place which had been a window, but was used as a cupboard.
Prisoner's Defence. I went out to play with some boys, and went there to hide myself. I know nothing of the shoes.

THOMAS WALKER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of May, I truck, value 2l., the goods of 



Thomas White.






STEPHEN WHITE
. I live with my father, Thomas White, a carpenter, in Peter's-lane, St. Sepulchre's—he lets out trucks—on the 9th of May, at half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came, and said he wanted a truck for Mr. Baylis, St. of John's Square, for about two hours—I went to Mr. Baylis about ten o'clock that night, and found he had not sent him—he was brought to my father in custody afterwards, and I knew him—the truck is worth 2l.—my father's name and address was on it—he did not ask for it to buy it—but only hired it.





THOMAS PHILPOT
 (policeman, G 85.) In consequence of information I went to Thomas Row, in Bagnigge Wells Road, with the prosecutor—he produced a receipt, and the prisoner afterwards said the receipt was his writing.

THOMAS Row. I am a wheelwright, and live in Bagnigge Wells Road—I bought a truck of a boy—he came on four different days about it—I think it was the prisoner—he brought it the first day—I said I should not buy it of him, and to tell his master, or whoever it belonged to, to come to me—I cannot exactly swear to the prisoner, because I am so bad in my head—the boy who brought it gave me a receipt—he did not write it in my presence—he brought it; this is it (reads):—"Bought of C. Tabel a truck. Paid."





RICHARD BAYLIS
. I am a surgeon—I did not send the prisoner to White for a truck—I never employed him on such an errand—I know him—his father-in-law is a tenant of mine—he has been very badly brought up—his parents are addicted to drinking.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

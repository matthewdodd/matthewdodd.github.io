            . I am a wholesale spice-dealer

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Bolton. On the 3d of October, I was at the end of the warehouse and saw the prisoner, and another man, pass the window; the prisoner returned, seized the bag of ginger, and drew it out of the warehouse; I followed and saw him standing ready to receive it on his shoulder-when he saw me he let the bag go and walked away; I looked for assistance-the prisoner and his companion had got as far as Pudding-lane. I gave the alarm-Mr. Bolton came up - We secured the prisoner; he denied it. I am positive he is the man - He was never out of my sight.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. The door was open-the bag was full eight feet from the door.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was only walking by.

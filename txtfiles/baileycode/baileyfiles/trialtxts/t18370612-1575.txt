 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of June, 1 watch, value 71.; 1 watch-chain, value 21.; and 2 seals, value 1/.; the goods of 



Charles Surgett, from his person; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES SURGETT
. I am an optician. On the 12th of June, I met the prisoner in Holborn—she got into conversation with me, and asked me to give her something to drink, as she was very dry—I treated her with two pints of half-and-half—when we left the public-house we went up Hatton-garden, and turned round Bleeding Heart-yard—in bidding her good night I put my hand into my fob, and missed my watch—I said, she deserved to be charged with the police, and if there was one near I would do so—she began to give me very abusive language, which caused a policeman to come forward, and I gave her in charge—I took the watch out of her right hand—nothing improper had passed between us.





BENJAMIN PHILLIPS
. I am a policeman. I heard the prisoner abusing the prosecutor very grossly—I went up, and he charged her with taking his watch which he had in his hand—I asked him in what manner she had taken it, and he told me.

Prisoner's Defence. He took me up the court, and said he had not a shilling in the world about him—I said I did not choose to stop with him he took the watch out of his pocket, and walked a little way up with me, and gave me in charge.





WILLIAM HENRY ENGLISH
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was in court when she was tried—she is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Recorder.

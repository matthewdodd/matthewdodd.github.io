            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 29th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the upper end of Crown-street, near Oxford-street, he had something rolled up in his apron. I went and asked him what it was; he said, a pair of shoes, which he had bought of a boy in the street. I looked at them, and said, "They are too large for you;" he said he gave 1s. 3d. for them, and he might get 2s. for them. I took him to several shops in Monmouth-street, and at last took him to Sullivan's, who said, he had lost a pair, and they were his property.
FRANCIS SULLIVAN. I keep a cellar in Monmouth-street; these are my shoes. I went out on the 28th of March, leaving them at my door; and the next morning the officer brought them to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I would have shown him the person I bought them of, if he would have gone with me, but he would not.

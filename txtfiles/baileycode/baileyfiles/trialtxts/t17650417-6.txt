                  Hopkins 
               



            . I live in Arundel-street, in the Strand


: I lost from a bureau book-case in my parlour, a lac'd suit of linen, which cost 45 l. about a month or five weeks ago; they never had been washed; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             and got them advertised, five guineas reward; after that they were brought to my lodgings, all but the tucker, by 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Kendrick 
               



             and 
               
                  Esther 
                  Coyle 
               



            , for which I gave them four guineas.
Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?
Mr. Hopkins. She was at our house to take care of a child, in the place of a servant
 that was turned away.


                  Eleanor 
                  Kendrick 
               



            . One 
               
                  Mary 
                  Mills 
               



             came to me about a fortnight ago, and ask'd me if I would buy these things (The things mentioned in the Indictment produced). She said she had them of her daughter-in-law, who had been chairing at a, gentleman's house, and they were gone away, and had left them behind: I said I would not part with them till the right owner was produc'd; I was directed to the prosecutor's house, hearing he had advertised them: that woman and the prisoner were carried before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; I know no more of it.


                  Esther 
                  Coyle 
               



            . I was at the last witness's house when the things were brought there: I went with her to the gentleman.


                  John 
                  Noaks 
               



            . I am a constable; Mr. Hopkins, applied to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             for a warrant to take up 
               
                  Mary 
                  Mills 
               



            ; we took her up; she delivered the buttons out of her pocket; I took her, and the prisoner, who is her daughter, before Sir John; the prisoner confessed before we took her to Sir John, and also before him, that she took the things out of Mr. Hopkins's for parlour, and delivered them to the old woman to sell: the old woman said, the prisoner told her she had them of a girl of the town: in searching the prisoner's box, we found a bunch of keys.
Mr. Hopkins. There was one of those keys which opened my bureau and all my drawers.

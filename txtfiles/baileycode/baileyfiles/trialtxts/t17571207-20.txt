Philadelphia Curry. The prisoner lived with me. The goods mention'd in the indictment were missing, and I suspecting the prisoner took her up, and charged her with taking them. She own'd the fact, and likewise where she pawn'd them.

            , two pawnbrokers, confirmed the evidence of the prosecutrix, producing part of the goods, which were deposed to by the prosecutrix.

FREDERICK HUTTON
. was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of November, 2 chairs, value 4s.; and 1 cushion, value 2d.; the goods of 



Richard Dudderidge.






RICHARD DUDDERIDGE
. I keep a broker's shop in Ball-alley, Shoreditch On the 12th of November I missed two chairs from the basement of the shutters—they were safe at six o'clock, and gone at seven—I went to the station the next night, and saw them—those now produced are them—I know them by the marks of some old brass furniture which I took off them.

Prisoner. You said they were outside the door. Witness. No, they were on the sill that the shutters lodge on under the roof of the house—there is no window—the shutters extend to the ground, and when they are down the shop is open.





GEORGE TRE
. (police-constable H 125.) I was in High-street, Shoreditch, in plain clothes, between seven and eight o'clock, on the night of the 12th of November—I saw the prisoner with these two chairs and this cushion—he saw me, and turned down a dark place—he began to run—I ran, and caught him in Swan-yard—I asked what he had got—he said "Two chairs," which a man in Whitechapel-road gave him as a pattern to get half a dozen, that he did not know the man, but he was outside a public-house door—this cushion belongs to the prosecutor also.


Prisoner's Defence. If I had wanted to escape I should have put them down; I was coming from the Docks, and saw a tipsy man; he told me to take these chairs, and if I could get any like them to go and tell him; if I had not found him I should have taken the chairs to the station; the policeman gave me two glasses of gin, he kept asking me where I got the chairs, and said he would let me go if I told him.




GUILTY.*. Aged 20.—

Transported for Seven Years.

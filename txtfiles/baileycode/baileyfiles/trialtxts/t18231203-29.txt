            . I am a linen-draper
, and live at Camberwell. On the 24th of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the end of Bridge-street, Fleet-street


, having just got out of the Camberwell-stage, and was attending to a dispute about the fare - a mob collected, and suspecting there might be pickpockets about, I kept my hand on my watch and coat flap, and felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket, turned round immediately, and collared the prisoner, and charged him with it - he denied it. I was positive that he had it, and gave him in charge. I saw it found on him at the Compter.

            . I am a constable. I took charge of him, and found the handkerchief inside his trowsers, down by his knee. He had denied having any such thing.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

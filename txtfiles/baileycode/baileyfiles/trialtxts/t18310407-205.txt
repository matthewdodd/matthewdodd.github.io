GEORGE EDMONDS. I live at Stepney. On the 28th of February I was going home, and got to Stepney-green


 at a quarter-past ten o'clock at night; the prisoner accosted me, and asked how I did - I said I wanted nothing at all to say to her, as I was going home; she approached me, and made a snatch, as if at my watch - it was a French one, and a flat one; I felt it was gone - she ran off with all the speed she could, and I after her; she turned up a street just by the green, and I lost sight of her for a moment - I was passing up the street, and a gentleman said, "Are you running after any person? I said, "Yes, after a woman who has taken my watch;" he said, "She is gone up here, and can't make her escape - if you will stop here I will fetch a Policeman." which he did in two or three minutes - I went up with the Policeman, and found the prisoner in some rains; he said to her, "What have you done with the watch?""Watch! (says she,) I know nothing of any watch - you may search me if you like;" he looked about, and picked up the watch within a yard of her.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was called, and took the prisoner - she denied all knowledge of the watch; when I first saw her she was on her hands and knees, behind a heap of rubbish, covering something- I looked, and found this watch.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

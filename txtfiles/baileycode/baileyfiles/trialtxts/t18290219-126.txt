            . I live in Charlotte-row, Mansion-house, and am clerk to a merchant
. On the 29th of January, between three and four o'clock, I was in Ludgate-street


, returning home, and had my handkerchief safe in my pocket shortly before I was informed it was gone; Leary produced it to me - he had hold of the prisoner at the time, and said he had taken it.

            . I am a servant out of place. I saw Mr. Simpson in Ludgate-street, and saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket: as I laid hold of him he had got the handkerchief out, and was concealing it; when I took him he dropped it: I took him on to Mr. Simpson, who claimed it.
Prisoner. Q. You was on the other side of the way? A. Yes; just by the church; I went right across to him - there was another lad with him.
Prisoner. The other lad threw it down by my side, and ran away. Witness. The prisoner threw it down; the other lad ran away when I crossed; the prisoner is the one who took it and dropped it.

THOMAS DAVIS. I am a constable, and received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent.

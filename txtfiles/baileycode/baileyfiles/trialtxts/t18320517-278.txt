. On the 14th of April, I took home some work; while I was there the prisoner came and asked for some Denmark sattin - Mr. Parry said he had not any, and asked her if it was to make shoes; she said Yes; he said he did not sell that sort - she then turned out of the shop; he asked me what she had got; I said I did not know; he told me to go and see - I went after her; she dropped this shirt, and said "Here is your shirt;" I took her back, and laid the shirt on the counter.

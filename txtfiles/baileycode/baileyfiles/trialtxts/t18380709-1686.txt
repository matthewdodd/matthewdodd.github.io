RICHARD TATTERSALL
. I live in Grosvenor-place. At half-past twelve o'clock on the night of the 4th of July, I was walking in the Haynmarket—I had a pocket-book, with a miniature, and a five-pound note in it—I felt a twitch—I turned, and saw the prisoner, and two men—I went to one of the other men, and the prisoner ran off—I followed him a short distance, and then called after him—he was stopped by the policeman, and this pocket-book, containing the miniature and note, was brought to the station with him.





SCROBERT DAINTRY
. I am a fisherman, and live at Lambeth. I was is the Haymarket, and saw the prisoner run by me—he chucked this pocket-book before me into the road—I took it to the station-house—I am sure the prisoner is the man who threw it.

            , ESQ. I live at Wimbledon. On the 20th of June I was walking from Newport-street into Lisle-street


, a man said I had lost something; I felt, and missed my handkerchief - he told me to follow him, which I did, and saw the prisoners in custody soon after. My handkerchief was produced.

            . I work for Mr. Ricketts, in the Strand. I was passing through Lisle-street, about a quarter before two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner ran against me. I watched them and saw them go up to Mr. Knipe. White took hold of his coat, and took his handkerchief out. They then crossed the road, and went through Newport-market, together. I lost sight of them for about two minutes, I overtook them in Porter-street. I seized White, and gave him to Mr. Knipe. I took Morton in Lumber-court, he threw the handkerchief down, about three yards before I took him.

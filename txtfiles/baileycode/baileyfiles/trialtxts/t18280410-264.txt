            . I am hackney coachman to Thomas Bird; he keeps his coaches in his yard, in Rathbone-place; on the 12th of April I was in Oxford-street, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner carrying this horse-hair, tied up with string; I called the watchman and he asked him where he got it, he said, "I got it out of that yard," alluding to my masters; I went to the yard and found the inside of two chariots and a coach all cut to pieces; he was quite a stranger.
THOMAS BIRD. I am a coach-master
 - my yard is in Rathbone-place


; I was at home in bed. I had left my carriage all secure; when I came down that morning I found the linings cut, and the horse hair taken out, to the damage of more than 20l. - my yard is not locked at night, but the watchman minds it; I believe this to be the lining of the carriages.

            . I am a watchman. I was called, and took the prisoner with this horse-hair.
Prisoner's Defence. When the watchman stopped me I told him that was the man who sent me for it, he was then about two yards before me; he took to his heels and ran off - several ran after him, but could not take him.

THOMAS FRANCIS. There was a man several yards before him, but he did not run.

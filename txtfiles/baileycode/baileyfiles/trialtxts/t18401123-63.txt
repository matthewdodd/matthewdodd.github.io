EMMA LIGHT
. I am the wife of John Light, and live at Pimlico. I missed a cap, which was hanging up in our yard to dry, about half-past five o'clock, on the 6th of November—I went out, and came up with the prisoner—I accused her of stealing the cap—she said she had not got it—the policeman saw it fall from her—this is it—(looking at it)—I had not seen the prisoner before—she reached over the fence, and got it out of my yard.





ELIZA BARRAN
. I am a neighbour of the prosecutor's. I saw the prisoner take the cap from the yard—she went up the lane and concealed it.





MICHAEL M'LAUGHLIN
. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner drop this cap.

Prisoner. I hope you will have mercy on me—it is the first time I ever was in Newgate.





RICHARED COLLE
. (police-constable B 110.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the clerk of the peace at Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

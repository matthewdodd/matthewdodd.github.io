they were gone—that was on the 22nd of January—the coach-house was fastened with a hasp inside.





JOSEPH CLEMENTS

Prisoner. I was going down Newman-passage, at half-past twelve o'clock that Sunday night, and these laid against the wall—I took them up, and in going home the officer met me and took me with them.

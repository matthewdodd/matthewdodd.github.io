            . I took the Man (the Prisoner) myself, the 11th of last Month: I took him in Bear-Key Buildings.
Q. In what Manner?
Mills. I was following my Man up Stairs, and found this Man coming down between one Story and half a Story; and I said, my Friend, where are you going? to get a little Sugar? I must see what you have got. He had an Apron hung down to his Knees, and a Bag: There it is: And in that Bag was the Sugar.
Q. This being found upon him, what did he say?
Mills. Why, he said, that he did it for Want.

                  English 
               



            . I am a West-India Merchant's Constable, and I heard that Mills had taken a Man; and he did desire me to come up, and he gave me Charge of the Prisoner at the Bar; and upon searching him, we found a Stocking full of Sugar in his Breeches.

            . My Lord, the Constable and I search'd him, and we found a Stocking full of Sugar between his Thighs.
Q. What did he say when you found it upon him?
Clark. Why, before he said he did it for Want; but after that he said nothing.
Q. Did he deny it before you found it upon him?
Clark. Yes.
Prisoner. In his Defence said, That he came to get a Job, and he thought they cried out for Hands, and for that Reason was coming down; but said, that he bought the Sugar of a Man, who said it was a Bargain; and that at first the Man asked 20 d. but took 14 d.

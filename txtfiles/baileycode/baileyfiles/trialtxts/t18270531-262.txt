. These lamps were all safe at two o'clock on Friday, the 19th of May - they were not used that night. Next morning, about nine o'clock, I missed five, and saw oil spilled near the bottle-rack, where they are kept - I found the prisoner in custody with them. John Frederick James is owner of the gardens. They were locked at night, and a watchman placed at each gate.

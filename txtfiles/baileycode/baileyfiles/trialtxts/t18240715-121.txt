            . I live in Corbet-court, Gracechurch-street. I had a snuff-box taken from me on Friday, the 9th of July, between twelve and one o'clock, as I was going down by the side of the Bank, towards Guildhall


. I felt a snatch at my pocket, I turned short round, and saw the prisoner, who turned round also, and threw away the box, which I picked up, and cried Stop thief! - I did not lose sight of him, he passed between some coachmen, who drive the stages, and I think there was a boy in a sustian jacket near him, but I kept my eye upon him; the other boy I believe crossed the way - he did not at all attempt to stop him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The other boy was as near the box as the prisoner - A. Yes; when I looked round there where two boys, but I saw the prisoner throw it away - there might have been half a dozen coachmen - I did not lose sight of him. His friends have been with me, they appear very respectable; his mother, I believe, is a widow.
CHARLES BOND. I am an officer. I heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was stopped by a young man, he fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.
GUILTY. Aged 17.

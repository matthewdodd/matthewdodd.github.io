 was indicted

24th of October, 5 1/4 yards of woollen cloth, value 2l. 7s., the goods of

ROBERT BURN
. I live in Cornhill, and am a woollen-draper. On the afternoon of the 24th of October, I was in the counting-house, at the back of my shop, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop door with five yards and a half of woollen cloth under his arm—it had been on a shelf—I went and overtook him in Lombard-street, with it under his arm—I asked where he was going—he said a gentleman told him to carry it to the West-end—I am sure he is the person who was carrying it out of the shop.

Prisoner. The witness asked how many coats I was going to make out of the cloth—he did not ask where I was going—the gentleman was close behind. Witness. Yes, I did; and he said he was going to take it to the West-end, that a gentleman told him to go into the shop and take it—it is the shop of Mr. Henry Lister Thornhill, and another.





WILLIAM HORD
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have the cloth.

Prisoner. I was at the window—the gentleman said, "I have just purchased a piece of cloth, go and get it"—I went in and got it, and came out with it under my arm—directly the gentleman took me—I told him I was going to take it to the West-end, and a gentleman gave it me to carry—there were several persons passing—he would not let me point him out.

MR. BURN. I had nobody in the shop—Mr. Thornbill and I were in the counting-house—the shop door was shut—I heard the door open—I went out at the back door.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

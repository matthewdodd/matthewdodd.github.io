             was indicted for 


               stealing a Night Gown, value 15 Shillings
            , the Goods of

             thus depos'd. I came home and call'd for my Gown and Slippers, and my Man told me he fear'd my Gown was stole, and I having seen the Prisoner lurking about the House, I suspected him, and went to an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood, where I found the Prisoner, I tax'd him with it, he made prevaricating Answers; whereupon I charg'd a Constable with him, search'd him, and found the Gown under his Coat.
The Prisoner in his Defence said, That he bought it of a Man that came into the Room where he was for 10 Shillings, but that wanting Proof, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

            . I live next door to the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner and another boy for some time opposite my window; I watched them, and saw them run; I then went out; the prisoner had got the printed cotton, and dropped it on my rails; I suspected he had stolen it - I took it up, and he was pursued and taken; the other. boy got away; I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who was running with the cotton and dropped it; he only ran into the next street.

            . I am an officer. I have the property. (Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence (written.) I passed the shop of the prosecutor; whilst doing so, a boy, who had taken a piece of print, threw it on the ground and ran away; a person from the shop ran after him, and I picked up the print, intending to keep it until the person who had gone in pursuit of the thief returned.

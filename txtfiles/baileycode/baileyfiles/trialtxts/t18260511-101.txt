JAMES GOOD. I am a shoemaker
, and live in Whitecross-street, St. Luke's


. I lost these shoes on the 3d of May - I had seen them safe in the window about half an hour before - a person could have taken them without coming into the shop - I am certain they are mine.

            . I am a constable. I live opposite to Good. I saw the prisoner and another come and look into the shop - I saw them pass again - I was at dinner - I saw them run down an alley - I followed and saw the prisoner with something under his coat; I kept close to him - he threw down these shoes; I took them up, and he got away - I took them both afterwards, but the other was discharged by the Magistrate.

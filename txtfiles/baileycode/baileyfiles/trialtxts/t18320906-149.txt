            . I am a general-dealer
, and live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate


. On the morning of the 7th of July I saw the prisoner at my door; he put out his left hand, and took hold of what I thought to be a pistol, and with his right hand he seemed to be cutting it down - I pursued him through several streets, and took him back to the shop; I am sure he is the person who cut the cord.

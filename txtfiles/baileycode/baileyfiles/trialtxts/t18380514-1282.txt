1282. 




MARGARET LEONARD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of March, 2 shillings, the monies of 



John Beckett, from the person of 



Mary Ann Alice Beckett; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






MART ANN ALICE BECKETT
. I am not quite eight years old; I live with my father and mother in Leather-lane; my father is a gilder. I recollect, some time ago, my mother gave me two shillings to go to pay Mr. Gobby, the milkman—I had the 2s. in my hand, and the prisoner met me at the

corner of Cross-street—I did not know her before—she said to me, "Mind, little girl, there is a man gone down there who took something from my mistress, and mind him, or you will be served the same"—she took the 2s. out of my hand, and put it into a piece of black silk, and pretended to put it down my bosom, and she put the piece of black silk down my bosom, but nothing in it—I found that as soon as I got down to the milkman's—I am sure the prisoner is the person.





CHARLES GOBBY
. I am a milkman. This little girl came to my place,—she put her hand into her bosom, and took out the silk, but there was no money in it.





JAMES LOCK
 (police-constable G 197.) I took the prisoner into custody—Mr. Beckett charged her with this—she said she never taw the child—she was taken to the station-house, and 11 1/2 d. found on her.





JOHN BECKETT
. I am the father of this child. My wife intrusted her with 2s., but I did not see it.

Primer's Defence. I never saw the child in my life.





JAMS LOCK
. I am a policeman. I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

Transported for Ten Years.

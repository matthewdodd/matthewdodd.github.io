            . I am an officer. On the 15th of January I saw the prisoner coming out of a house in Crown-street, Soho, with a green bag - I took him, and found on him a watch; I went back to the house, and found this box great coat hanging on the bedstead; there were two other well-known thieves at the door - we took them, and found on them seven silver spoons; the prisoner told my brother officer, that he bought the coat of a gentleman's servant in Gower-street, and at the office he said he had bought it of a Jew in Petticoat-lane.

            . I was with Stone; what he states is correct.

            . I am coachman to Thomas Barrett Lennard, Esq. I lost this great coat on the morning of the 14th of January, from our front door, at No. 38, Upper Brook-street, while I was gone to get the horses for the carriage - I saw nothing of the prisoner till the 29th, when I came up from Brighton.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had purchased the coat in Petticoat-lane.

            . I am a farrier
, and live at Manchester. On the 9th of November, about three o'clock, I was looking at the Lord Mayor's procession, my watch was in my fob, it had a ribbon and key to it; as I was going up Bridge-street


, towards Fleet-market, I saw a crowd and suspected them - I put my hand in my fob pocket, I was hustled which made me let go, and at that moment I felt my watch violently wrenched out of my pocket, I saw the prisoner pull it out, and give to another person on his right - I collared him immediately, and kept him till an officer came and took him.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. There was a great crowd - A. Yes. I cannot be mistaken in his person.

Q. Have you enquired into his character - A. Yes; and I find he has been transported before.

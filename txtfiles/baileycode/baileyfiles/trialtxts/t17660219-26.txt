; the prisoner lodged in my house three nights: the things mentioned in the indictment were hanging in the first floor backwards, the prisoner lay in that room. She came the 21st of January, and went away the 24th, at 11 in the day: we found one of the gowns at a pawnbroker's, pawned by another woman, who found the prisoner. She was taken before the Justice, there she owned to the taking the things, and said the devil tempted her to do it.
Mrs. Dass, his wife, confirmed the account he gave.
Mr. Kilderman the constable produced the things, and deposed he had some from Mr. Ashbridge's, and some from Mr. Forshell's, two pawnbrokers, deposed to by Mrs. Dass.

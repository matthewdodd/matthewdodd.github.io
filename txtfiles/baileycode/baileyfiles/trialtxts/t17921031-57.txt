- CAVE sworn.
I am shopman to the prosecutor; I was standing in the middle of the shop; between two and three in the afternoon I heard the shop glass break; the prisoners were together; they ran away; these buckles were missing; I pursued them, and saw one deliver to the other something, and when they came to the end of the street, one went one way and the other the other; I pursued Jones, and he threw a pair of buckles over the church-yard wall. (The buckles produced and deposed to.)
Cave. I am clear the prisoners are the persons that broke the glass and took out the buckles.
Prisoner James Jones. I only came out of the country on Sunday morning.
Prisoner Harrison. My Lord, I leave what I have to say to my counsel.

The prisoner Harrison called one witness to his character.

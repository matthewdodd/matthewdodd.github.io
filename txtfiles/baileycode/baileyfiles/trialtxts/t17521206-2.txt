            . I live in Long-Acre


, and am a Coachmaker
; I lost two chariot harnesses out of my shop on the 25th of Sept. having seen them that day, I advertised them on the 29th, and on that day I saw one of them on a horse in a hackney-coach going by, belonging to 
               
                  William 
                  Flin 
               



            , I stopp'd it, and 
               
                  William 
                  Flin 
               



             came and said before justice Cox he bought them for 16 s. The justice ordered him to return the harnesses, and do the best he could to find out the man he bought them of. One harness was produc'd in court, which he depos'd to, the other he had at home.

            . I keep a hackney-coach ; the prisoner brought this harness to me on the 25th of Sept. at Mr. Dickerson's shop, and Mr. Dickerson valued it at 15 s. I bought it for 16 s. he told me he had them to sell for a coachman.
William Dickerson. I am a Coachmaker, in Gray's-Inn-Lane; the prisoner brought this harness to my shop to sell to Mr. Smith; I hung it up that I might see it, and valued it at three crowns ; the prisoner said he brought it from the Cross-Keys in Gracechurch Street, and was to sell them for another man: Mr. Smith bought it of him for 16 s.
Prisoner's Defence.
On the 25th of Sept. I was going to look after business near Gray's Inn Gate, I met one 
               
                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            , he ask'd me to sell the harness for him, and said he'd pay me for my trouble; I took them and inquir'd in Holborn, then in Bloomsbury-Square, there I was told 
               
                  William 
                  Flin 
               



             wanted such; I went and found him at Mr. Dickerson's house, and sold that to him, and Johnson stay'd at the Lane-End the while ; I went and gave him 14 out of the 16 s. I have seen him once since, and never but once.

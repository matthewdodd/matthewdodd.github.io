JANE BLAKE



, stealing 1 shawl, value 1l.; the goods of 



Harriet Medler; having been before convicted: and 




LOUISA HUGHES



 feloniously receiving the same: to which


BLAKE pleaded 


GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.






DANIEL ROGER
. I am in the service of Joseph Roger. I produce a shawl, pawned on 15th July, by Hughes—she said it belonged to her aunt—her aunt was in the habit of pledging at our shop—Blake was with her, but said nothing.





HARRIET MEDLER
. I am servant at 4, Brook-court, Holborn, a home of accommodation. Blake lodged there—on 15th July she and I were in the kitchen, about half-past four o'clock—I fell asleep—I awoke about five, missed my shawl from my box, which was opened, and the prisoner gone—it was safe when I fell asleep, but the key was in it—she did not come back—the shawl produced is the one I lost.





JOHN PORTER
 (policeman, G 101). I took Hughes on 5th Aug., and told her I had a charge against her for being concerned, with another person, in stealing a shawl—she said she knew nothing about any shawl—on the road to the station, she said, "Oh, I remember now going with a girl, and pledging a shawl; I pledged it in my own name, and told the pawnbroker it was my aunt's; I pledged it for 5s., and we had 2s. 6d. each, and had some biscuits, and something to drink."

Hughes' Defence. Blake asked me to pawn it; I thought if I said it was my aunt's I could get more on it; I gave her the money.

HUGHES—


NOT GUILTY
.

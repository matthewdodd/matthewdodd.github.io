CHARLES M'CARTHY



, stealing 12 pence and 12 halfpence of 



Ann Gorman: having been before convicted.






ANN GORMAN
. Last Thursday week, between six and seven in the evening, I was in London-passage—I had eighteen-pence in my pocket—I saw the prisoner there, and he pushed me three times against the post, and put his hand into my pocket, and took out my eighteen-pence, it was all in pence and halfpence—he ran away, and I hallooed after him, and called after him by name; I know him well—I saw him next day, and told him I was too poor, I could not allow him my eighteen-pence; since he had robbed me of the eighteen-pence, I asked him to give it to me; he said, "You b—b—I will knock your brains out," and he had a large stick in his hand—he was taken into custody about half an hour after.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Is London-passage rather a dark place? A. Yes; he came to my side, not behind me—it was all done in a minute—the moment he got his hand out of my pocket he ran away—he did not tell me the next day that he had stolen none of my money, and wish me to go away.





JOHN REEVE
 (policeman, A 424.) I took the prisoner at the Old Friends' beer-shop, London-passage, St. Luke's.—I told him I wanted him for robbing a woman of eighteen-pence; he said he knew nothing of it—I told him he must go with me, and he went down on his knees and held the legs of the table, so that I should not get out, and said did I want to get him transported—he asked a man who was there to get the money and pay the woman—Gorman came in, and said, "That is the man who robbed me of eighteen-pence"—I took him to the station.





JOHN NEVILLE
 (policeman, G 152.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted at Clerkenwell, April, 1850; confined Nine Months)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner's Defence. That is true; but a man has owned to it since I have been out.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

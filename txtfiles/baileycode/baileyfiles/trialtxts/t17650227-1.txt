            . I live in Kingstone, am a waterman, and buy and sell fish
; I use the George under the Piazzas, at Billingsgate


. Last Monday was fortnight, I lost a basket from thence, with the fish mentioned in the indictment. Going about to see if I could meet with them again, I catched the prisoner with them on his head, in Bishopsgate-street: my name being on the basket, I took him by the collar, and said, are not you a villain and a rogue, for stealing my fish? he stood like a saint, and said nothing. I led him down to Billingsgate; he began to be obstropulous, but I secured him.

            . A man asked me to help him up with a basket of fish: I took but little notice of his person, but I believe the prisoner to be the man: I said, aye my cock, I will, and helped him up with them.

Prisoner's Defence.
I was in liquor, and know nothing of it.
Q. to Prosecutor. What time of the day did you meet with the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street?
Prosecutor. It was between nine and ten o' clock; he did not appear to be drunk.

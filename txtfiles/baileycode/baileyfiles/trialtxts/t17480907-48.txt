            . On the 19th of June I went on board my ship, which lies near Wapping


, and the officers told me there was some indico gone, and a waterman told me the prisoner had sent on board for it; there was about five or six pound in that parcel, and there was a bag of thirty five pound missing that night, and some of our people said that they saw Johnson on shore with money, and that he was very drunk; and they ask'd him how he came by it, and he said he had receiv'd his wages; I told him I had reason to think he had it, because he was missing; and I said, as the indico is lost it must be paid for, and you must pay towards it: afterwards I found this indico was sold in Wapping for 2 s. 9 d. a pound, and it was worth 3 s. 9 d. or 3 s. 10 d.

             . On the 10th of June the prisoner desired I would give him a cast to shore, and he put a basket on board my boat of 9 pounds of indico; and I took a bit out and bit it, and asked if it was coals; he said it was indico, and it was sold to one Miles for 23 s.

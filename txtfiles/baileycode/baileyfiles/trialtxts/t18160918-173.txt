CHRISTIANA SMITH. I was coming up Redcross-street, and the prisoner asked me if I would go of an errand for him, and I said I would; and he said it was to take his compliments to his brother, and bring a bottle of blacking and his box, and he told me to mind and not spill the blacking over the clothes; he directed me to a public-house where to go to; he took the gown out of my lap, and when I went into the public-house the people all laughed at me, and when I came out again to the top of Wood-street


, the prisoner was gone.

            . I sent this little girl with this gown. On the 18th I saw it exposed for sale in Grubb-street; I asked the price of it, and they asked eight shillings. While we were talking about it, the prisoner went past, and he was pointed out as the person who sold it.

            , ESQ
. The prisoner was my footman
, and had been so for seven years. On the 31st of May I had a party at my house, at St. John's-wood


, and had occasion, at ten o'clock at night, to go to my cellar, to get a bottle of wine - on going down I heard a key drawing out of my cellar door, and on getting to the second step, I saw the prisoner at the cellar door, and I thought I saw something like steel in his hand - I charged him with being the thief whom I thanked God I had at length found out - I demanded of him the key; he said he had no key: I laid hold of his left arm, and said, "Give it up, you have one;" he then drew this key from his pocket, and gave it me - I faced to the right, and in his pantry saw a bottle of wine, which had been recently taken from my cellar; I gave him in charge - I had before discharged my cook, and had the lock of my cellar altered; this key opens the cellar - I never gave any one the key to go to the cellar.

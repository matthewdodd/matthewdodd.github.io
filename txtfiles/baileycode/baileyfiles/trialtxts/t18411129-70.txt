JOHN WINTER
. I live in Spur-street, Leicester-square. I was walking with my brother in Regent-street, on the 9th of November—my brother spoke to me—I looked, and found my purse which had been in my coat-pocket, lying in the road—there were three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and a half-crown in it—I had seen it safe within ten minutes.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. There were other persons about? A. Yes—it was about two o'clock.





CHARLES WINTER
. I was with my brother in Regent-street—I saw the prisoner with the purse in his hand, close to my brother's pocket—I immediately seized him, and he threw it into the street—my brother said, "What is the matter? what for?"—I turned him round, and told him to look into the street.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you a military man? A. I am a private gentleman—the prisoner was about a foot from me—when I turned I saw the purse plainly in his hand—I caught him round the waist, and he threw it away.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

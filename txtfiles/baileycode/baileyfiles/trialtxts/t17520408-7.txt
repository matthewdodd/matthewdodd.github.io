            . The prosecutor is a relation of mine, I live with him. On the 20th of February in the morning, the prisoner came to Mr. Lee's house; I know her very well, she lived in the neighbourhood: one of the servants told me she had been behind the bar; I went to see if the things were safe, and miss'd the mustard-pot; I said I insisted upon having her searched before she went out of the house; she then desired to speak with me in another room; there she opened her apron, in which I found the mustard pot and spoon. (Produced in court and deposed to)
Prisoner's defence.
There were two or three people got me to drink with them, I was very much in liquor, and what they lay to my charge I know nothing of.

2681. 




HENRY WILLIAM SHOOTER
 was indicted

for embezzlement.






HENRY HODGES
. I am a coach-builder, and live at Camberwell. The prisoner was a labourer or helper in my service—I used to allow him to collect money occasionally—the last few months, in consequence of something which happened, the mode of settlement has been every evening.





STEPHEN SHINDER
. I owed the prosecutor 5s.—on the 1st of September I paid it to the prisoner—he did not give me a receipt.





JAMES ALEY
. I owed the prosecutor 3s.—I paid it to the prisoner, on his master's account, on the 5th of September.





EDWARD HOWELL
. I owed Mr. Hodges 5s.—on the 11th of October I paid it to the prisoner on account of his master—I did not ask him for a receipt.





HENRY HODGES

re-examined. The prisoner did not account to me for any of these sums—he denied having received more than what he gave me—I found this out by his absconding from my service on the llith—he had been in my service seven years.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

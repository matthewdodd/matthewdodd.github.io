JAMES BROADHURST. I am a labourer

. On the 26th of June I was laying down under a cart, with a load of hay in it, by the side of a rick; Thomas Parish was with me - we had taken off our shoes, and put them by the side with some bay over them; a man awoke us at half-past six o'clock in the morning - we had laid down about ten o'clock in the evening; the man said, "Come along," and we ran after the prisoner - Parish caught him, and held him till I came up.
THOMAS PARISH. I pulled off my shoes, and covered them with hay - I pursued the prisoner, and caught him about a quarter of a mile off; he had got my pair of shoes and my mate's on him - these are them.
Prisoner's Defence. I went to Ealing, and fell in with two or three friends - I got a drop too much, and could not get home; I laid down at a public-house door - the Policeman came, and awoke me at half-past six o'clock in the morning - I got up, and ran off to my work; I saw these shoes, and picked them up - I did not see the men laying there.

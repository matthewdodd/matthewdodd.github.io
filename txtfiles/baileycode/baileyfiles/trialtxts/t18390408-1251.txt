ELIZABETH TURNEB
. I live opposite the shop of Mr. Richard Strong, in High-street, Poplar—I can see from our window into his shop—on the 21st of March, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking into the prosecutor's window—he then crept in on his hands and toes, and went round the counter—he opened the till, and put his hand in—I told my master, Mr. Dakin, who went and gave information.





ELIZABETH STRONG
. I am the wife of Richard Strong, a baker. Mr. Dakin told me of this, and I went into the shop—the prisoner was then on the outside of the counter—I asked him if he had any money—he said yes, and what he had was his own—he then took some money from his bosom—I put my hand to his bosom, and felt this bowl, which I had seen in the till a little before, with eight farthings in it—he had 2s. 11d. in coppers.





THOMAS CONNOR
 (police-constable K 195) I took the prisoner in charge.

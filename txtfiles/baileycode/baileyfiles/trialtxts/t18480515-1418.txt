THOMAS HAWKINS.
 I am a carpenter, at Boddy-bridge, Upper Ground-street. On 8th May, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Mint-street, Borough; I was attacked by three men—the prisoner was one—he and another one collared me—one of them took 22s. from my waistcoat-pocket—I was not sober, or drunk—I had had a drop extra—I lost my hat, and my handkerchief was off—I said, "You vagabonds, you are not satisfied with taking my money but must take my hat"—a policeman came up immediately.





ROBERT BRANTFORD
 (policeman.) I was o duty, and heard Hawkins say, "You vagabonds, you have got my hat"—I saw the prisoner and two others collaring him against the wall—the prisoner took his hand from Hawkin's right waistcoat-pocket—they all three went away together—I pursued them; a severe struggle ensued—I took the prisoner—I found nothing on him—I am sure he is one of them—I know by sight.

Prisoner's Defence. I never took the money, and never saw the man.
(The prisoner received a good character.)




GUILTY.*† Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

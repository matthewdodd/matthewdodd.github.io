1556. 




JOHN DIXX
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of June, I bolster, value 6s.; and 2 sheets, value 4s.; the goods of 



Richard Eleon; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH ELEON
. I am the wife of Richard Eleon, who keeps the White Horse, in Little Britain. On the 9th of June, at half-past ten o'clock at night the prisoner came and asked for a lodging—he paid eightpence for it and went to bed—the next morning he came down at half-past eight o'clock with a large bundle-that caused my suspicions, and I sent after him-these sheets and bolster are mine—they were on the bed that night.





EDWARD GADSBY
. I live in Jewin-street. I stopped the prisoner in Falcon-square on the 9th of June—he dropped this bundle—I gave him in charge with it.





JOHN WADE
, (City police-constable, 24.) I received this bolster and one sheet were in it.





WILLIAM THOMAS
, (City police-constable, 35.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

             lives in the Grange, Southwark: he sent the skins mentioned to the White Hart Inn, in the Borough, in order to be carried to a customer at Guildford; the prisoner, with two others, were dodged by Mr. Newton from near St. Mary Overy's church-yard over the bridge, and up Grace-church-street, who observed sometimes one carried them, and sometimes the others; the other two deserted the prisoner at the Cross-keys, Grace-church-street, where was a watchman whom Mr. Newton called to his assistance, and they secured the prisoner with the leather.

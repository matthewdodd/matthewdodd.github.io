             sworn.
I am the wife of 
               
                  George
                   Southo
               



            . On the 23d of March I was going into the country; my father had been very bad with the gout; when I had been up stairs to pack my clothes up I says to 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Biggs
               



            , (she was my servant
,) I should stop for the course of two or three days, and I told her to go and get the key of Mr. Morgan's room, who was a gentleman who lodged in the house; I bid her go down into the bar to get the key to make Mr. Morgan's bed; I told her not to go out of the way while I was gone for very likely I might stay three or four days; I returned back between eleven and twelve the same night; I hung that black cloak on the chair back; I keep the Ben Johnson's Head, Pelham-street, Spitalfields; I got up to make six pennyworth of brandy and water, and being very much agitated in my mind on account of my father being so bad, I did not recollect the cloak till the next morning; in that same room where she had been making the bed, was a closet where I always put the dirty linen; I did not go to bed till very near four o'clock in the morning, in the morning about a quarter past seven the other servant came to inform me that 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Biggs
               



             was not in the house, and that when she went down stairs she found the street door left open, and the bar which used to fasten the door was put against the door, to keep the door open, and the key of the closet was taken away where the foul linen was; I lost one cap a pair of cotton stockings, one coarse apron, a black cloak and several other articles, to the value of thirty shillings; I had always used her with the greatest tenderness that any person could; the things were put into the closet, and thekey used to hang in the bar, at the same place where the key of the room was; I never saw the things after she went away not till the time she was taken; she was taken the 11th of May, when she was examined before the magistrate she had got on a pair of cotton stockings and a coloured apron, part of the things that was missing; Mr. Southo went to Clerkenwell Prison to her on Sunday the 12th of May, and she acknowledged where the other things were; on the 13th I went and see my own cloak; she had put it in pawn at one Kendall's, Brick-lane, Old-street, for ten shillings and six pence, and then it was fetched out by one Mrs. Holloway; she bought the duplicate of 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Biggs
               



             for four shillings.

            . As nigh as I can guess about seven weeks ago yesterday, she came into the shop and waited while I served two people, I then asked her her business? and she asked me if I wanted to buy a ticket of a cloak? I told her I did not want one; she said she was in great distress, and that she had not had any victuals to eat since the day before; I asked her how she came so distressed? she told me she had been bad of a fever near on three months; I told her as she was so distressed, I did not want a cloak, I would let her have some victuals, and if I heard any body wanted it I would let her know; in about an hour and a half she came again and asked if I had heard of any body? and I told her no; then she begged me to buy it; accordingly I did buy it; I gave her four shillings for the duplicate, to the best of my recollection there was a shawl and a cloak, they were pawned at Mr. Kendall's Brick-lane; I sent for them, and they were brought to me; the officer has got them now.

             sworn.
I am a constable at the public office in Worship-street; I have got a cloak and a shawl, and some other things; after the gentleman had been robbed he came and laid information at our office Worship-street; I knew the prisoner, and some time afterwards I apprehended her, and on her there was an apron and a pair of stockings; after that we found a cloak, a shawl, a cap and a shift in Mrs. Holloway's possession; they were delivered to me before the magistrate at the office;

                   Holloway
               



             was there. (Produced.)
Holloway. This cloak and shawl I believe are the same I had of Harris the Pawnbroker.
Q. You are not sure of it? - Yes, I am perfectly sure.
Court to Harris. Did the prisoner say any thing about these things? - She said the cloak, &c. was there at Mrs. Holloway's.
Q. Did she say how the things came there? - She did not tell me how they came there; I went along with Mrs. Southo to the house of Mrs. Holloway, and there they were; I told her to come with me before the magistrate, and she did the same day without any summons or any thing; the stockings were on her legs, and the apron was on her side. (Deposed to by Mrs. Southo.)

             and I lived fellow servants together, with Mrs. Southo. On Sunday morning the 24th of March the prisoner got up near about seven in the morning, and left me in bed; when I came down I found the door open, and when my mistress and master got up they missed the property, and then we never saw any more of her till the 11th of May; when we were at the office the constable took a pair of stockingsoff her legs, and an apron off her sides; after that we went to Mrs. Holloway's and found the cloak.
Prisoner. On Sunday morning I got up and left my mistress Southo, and went out, and left the door open, and in about two months afterwards I met with the officer, and he said I must go with him to the office, and I never owned any thing, but my master came to me to the prison, and said if I would confess where the things were, so that he might get his property again, I should not be hurted.
Court to Mrs. Southo. Do you know whether there was any promise made to her or not? - There was not; it is false what she says.

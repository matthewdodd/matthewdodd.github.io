            . I am butler and footman to the present Lord Egmont. The plate was in my care from the 19th to the 22 d. We lost a pair of silver candlesticks with silver nozles.
Q. Was the old lord dead then or not?
Normond. I think he was.
Q. Where did your young lord live?
Normond. In Portland Square


. I missed them on the 22d of December. They were left in the butler's pantry. As soon as I missed them I enquired of my fellow servant where he put them. I searched, and found they were stolen. I went and acquainted his Lordship of it; and asked his Lordship to let me go to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . He desired I would not. He said it was our own carelessness, and desired we would take better care for the future. About ten o'clock the nozles were brought to the house by Mr. Noakes, the constable: he found out who the plate belonged to by the crest. I saw the candlesticks on Wednesday; they were very much disfigured, the quantity of the place was equal to about one of the candlesticks, The crest on the nozle is very plain, and not disfigured; I know nothing of the prisoners.

            . Last Friday was three weeks the prisoners came up to the room where I live, and

             with them. I am housekeeper to Mr. Gardiner, a cabinet-maker in St. Ann's Lane. Walker and Able lodged in our garret three or four weeks before that. They said, they had got some wedge. I said what, he said it was French plate. Walker said, I have something under my arm I don't know what it is. When he laid it on the table, it was covered with wet buy. He asked me, if I would buy it; I told him, it was not in my power. They said they would be much obliged to me to sell it for them. I said, I did not know where in sell it. I said, I would go to a silversmith at the corner of the Park, that I had bought several things of, and ask him to buy it. I carried, it to Mr. Trip's; I told him, it was a young man that had but little acquaintance that sent me with it. He stopt it, and would not let me have it. I went to 
               
                  John
                   Gardiner
               



            . He was at work at his father's house in the ambury, and we went both to Mr. Trip's together to know what I should do about it, to get myself out of the scrape. I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . I met Mr. Noakes, and told him of it. I knew Mr. Noakes before, I gave him information of the prisoners, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Able

            , where I thought he might find them. They were gone, and I was committed to Bridewell. They lodged in the same house with me, about a fortnight. I let them lodgings at two-pence a night. I knew nothing of them before. They both lodged in the same room. It was three weeks before this affair happened.
Job Trip. I am a silversmith at the corner of King-street, by the Park. I know the young woman last examined; she has been several times at my shop to buy odd things, spoons, &c. I don't know where she lives. She never did any thing that I know of bad before this. She brought a candlestick to sell about the twenty-fourth of December last; the crest was almost split in two in the middle (the candlestick produced, broke in three pieces.) I told her it was stole, and I should stop it; and said if I did not know you, I would stop you as well as the plate. She said, a young man had given it her to sell. She did not tell me his name. She said, she knew him well, and he should be taken. I let her go, and shops the candlestick; she returned in about twenty minutes. Mr. Gardiner came with her. She wanted my advice, as they thought they were got into trouble. It was thought this Mr. Gardiner lived with this woman. I told them, if they knew the people, it was best to go to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and have them taken up immediately, and I would send my man with them. She said, she was afraid they would hang the man. I told them I could not part with the plate till somebody was brought to justice. I was before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and he bound me over to appear and give evidence.
- Gardiner. I am a cabinet-maker. This

             is my house-keeper. I let part of my house out. I let the garrets to working people. The prisoners lodged with me about three weeks. She was not acquainted with them no farther than receiving the money, &c. for their room. I was not there when they brought the candlesticks. She told me what had happened about these things. I went with her to Mr. Trip's, to ask his advice. I know no more of the matter.

            . I am a constable. The first I heard of it was the Friday before Christmas day. This woman and Gardiner came to Bow-street, and said, they wanted to speak to me. They told me, they had stopt some things, but Gardiner said, he would not tell me any thing about it, unless the woman was admitted an evidence. I took them to Sir John, and told him, I believed these people had stopt something, and they were the candlesticks. Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             desired her to come into the office, I asked her where the remainder was. They stopped Mr. Gardiner in the office. The woman said, she would go and shew me where the remainder was. She took me to the New Way, Westminster, at an old cobler's, up stairs; some of Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's men were with them. When I came into the room, the woman said, Where is what I left? The old man said, where you put it, there it is; you have no business to bring your things here; she told me, to look under a rabbit hutch. There I found this candlestick and the nozle under some hay. The woman told me they had stopped the persons they had it us. She took me down to shew me where the two prisoners were; at one 
               
                  James
                   Martin
               



            's; they were gone, they were brought by some other people. These candlesticks were not advertised. I carried them to my lord, on Sunday morning. I found by an engraver whose arms they were. She told me the names of the prisoners when she went with me to take them. I have searched the house several times before.
Able's Defence.
I lodged in Mr. Gardiner's house. I always paid the lodging every morning. I paid my last night's lodging when I was going into the room. I saw Mr. Martin with two candlesticks. I went in and paid my night's lodging. I lodged there that same week; this was a little before Christmas. This woman has done this that she might get the reward. She said, if we were cast, she would send somebody to take us from the gallows, and pay the money for burying us.
Walker's Defence.
I lodged in the house. I went down to pay my lodgings, and saw 
               
                  James
                   Martin
               



             with a bundle under his arm. She bragged in Tothill-fields prison what she would do if she could cast us. Mitchell passes for Gardiner's wife.
Both

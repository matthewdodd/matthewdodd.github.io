            . I keep a shop in the Strand


, in the jewelry way
. The boy at the bar was a yearly servant to me: last Sunday morning, I wanted something in his room; I found in his coat pocket a pair of plated shoe-buckles, which he has owned to be mine, before the justice: I did not charge him till the Monday night: I thought he had only took them out to wear: he was searched by the constable: I was present, and saw a parcel of papers taken out of his pocket; there were four gross of paste stones; then he confessed taking a great many things, and owned he sold a garnet drop at a shop on Ludgate-hill.
Q. How long has he been with you?
Sherry. He has been with me about 3 months.

            . I am the constable. I was sent for on the Monday night: I searched the prisoner, and found this parcel of paste stones in his pocket, (Producing a parcel.)
Prosecutor. These look like mine: I have a great many such; but the prisoner owned they were mine, and that he had taken them.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.




               Guilty of stealing, but not in the shop

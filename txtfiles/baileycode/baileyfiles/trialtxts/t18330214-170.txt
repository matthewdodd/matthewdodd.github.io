            . I am a salesman, and live in High-street, Shoreditch


. On the 19th of January I was at my shop door, which is four doors from the prosecutor's - I saw the prisoner and two others lurking about his door; I watched them, and saw the prisoner take two bladders of lard out of the window, and put them into his apron - I went to him, and he dropped them at my feet.

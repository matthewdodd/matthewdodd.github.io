JOHN BIRT. I am a linen-draper
, and live in Little Russell-street, Covent-garden


. On the 29th of March, between one and two o'clock, I was at dinner in my back parlour - the calico was on an iron bar about one yard within my shop; I saw the prisoner come in and look at it, then take it off the bar, and walk off with it; I followed and took her about ten yards from the door, with it under her shawl - she appeared to be sober.

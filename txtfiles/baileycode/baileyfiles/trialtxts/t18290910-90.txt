. On the 17th of August I lost a waistcoat, a pair of shoes, and a handkerchief, from my bed-room in my father's house; I left them safe when we all went out to work - when I returned at night they were all gone; the prisoner lodged at my father's, and slept in the same bed with me.

            . When the prosecutor came home, and missed these things, he told me if I saw the prisoner to take him; I did take him, and this waistcoat of mine was found on him at the time.

JAMES HAMILTON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
2nd of September, 1 pair of boots, value 3s., the goods of 



Alexander Aland: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ALEXANDER ALAND
. I live in Charles-street, Chelsea. I was in Hyde-park

on the 2nd of September, about six o'clock—I was bathing—I had left my clothes on the bank, and when I came out of the water my boots were gone—I know nothing of the prisoner, but I found the boots on his feet on the 4th of September, and gave him into custody—I know the boots by two cracks on the upper leather of one of them.





GEORGE HEATH
. I was bathing in the Serpentine, on the 2nd of September where the prisoner was—I saw the prisoner near the spot where the clothes were—I did not see him do any thing, but he went away in a minute.





HENRY HALL
 (police-constable B 176.) I took the prisoner with the boots on his feet.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought them, and did not know they were stolen.





MARY HARMAN
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at the office of the Clerk of the Peace of Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

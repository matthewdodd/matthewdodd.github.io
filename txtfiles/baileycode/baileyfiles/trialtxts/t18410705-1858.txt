1858. 




WILLIAM ALEXANDER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of July, 1 half-crown and 5 shillings, the monies of 



Francis Hall; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






FRANCIS HALL
. I live in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove, and am a cab driver. I do not know what the prisoner is, but he slept in the same lodging with me, and in the same bed for about a week—from time to time I missed money out of my trowsers pocket, and I suspected the prisoner—I marked 17s. 6d. in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, on the 2nd of July, and put it into my trowsers pocket—the prisoner went to bed before I did that night—there was nobody lodged in that room but him and me—I awoke about nine o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was then gone, and I missed five shillings out of one pocket, and half-a-crown out of the other—I went to the landlady, and found the prisoner was at work, at St. John's Wood Chapel—I got an officer; and went and took him—I told him he had taken my money—he said he had never seen it, and did not want my money—I gave him in charge, and the officer found in one of his shoes six halfpence and one farthing, and in the other shoe one of my marked shillings and one of my half-crowns—four of the shillings I have lost.





WILLIAM TUCKER
 (police-constable S 129.) I searched the prisoner—I found in his left shoe six halfpence and one farthing, and in his right shoe this half-crown and shilling.





MATTHEW RIORDEN
 (police-constable D 135.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

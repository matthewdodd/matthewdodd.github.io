WILLIAM ALLEN. I am ostler at the White-Bear-inn, at Hounslow; Thomas Stroud was under-ostler. The stable is close to the White-Bear—I saw it fastened up about eleven o'clock at night—I went between six

and seven the next morning, and found the stable and corn-bin broken open, and the things stated in the indictment gone—I called the policeman—on the Friday night following I stood at the door—some person went and pulled the stable-door open again, and went in—I spoke to the policeman—we went into the loft, and found the prisoner concealed in the hay—he had my shoes on his feet, and this handkerchief tied round his face—I asked what he had done with the shirt—he said, "I never had one"—I said, "You had better tell us, it will be better for you"—he said, "I sold the shirt at a little second-hand slothes-shop just in House-low"—this is the property.





THOMAS STROUD
. I lost these things from the loft—Allen has told what is true.





THOMAS WILLIAM DANIELS
. I am a policeman. I was sent for, and went into the loft—the prisoner was lying there, with the shoes on his feet, and the handkerchief on his head—I conveyed him to the station—in going along, Allen asked him what he had done with the shirt—he said lie never had a shirt—Allen said he had better tell—he then said he sold it for 8d.—I went and got it—the stable had been broken through some boards—he had broken the lock on the corn-bins, and got these things out.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I saw the least of these lads go into Mr. Vaughan's warehouse about a quarter after six in the evening, on the Saturday night the 12th of July, and in about five minutes he brought out a firkin of butter on his knees; one of the lads, 
               
                  David
                   Evans
               



            , came up to him as he was sitting close by the warehouse door upon a bench, and the prisoner, 
               
                  William
                   Derry
               



            , was with him.
Were they near enough to see him go in? - Yes, they were close by him at the time, and 
               
                  David
                   Evans
               



             came up to him when he sat down on the firkin, and he held out his hand to receive something from this little lad, whether he did or no I do not know; when he was stopt with the butter, Evans said, he was hired to carry it for a pint of beer; I did not see him give him any thing; I took 
               
                  David
                   Evans
               



             into custody with the butter; the other two lads made off; I and another pursued them, but they got off; I am sure these are the same lads; I was as near them as I am to your lordship; I had a good opportunity of seeing them; one of them was taken about two days after; I knew him directly; the little one was taken about a week after; I knew him directly; the butter and the prisoner Evans were secured.

                   HARVEY
               



             sworn.
I was sitting at a public house drinking a pint of porter opposite this gateway where the warehouse was, and this young man desired me to watch these people while he went into the warehouse to know if any thing was delivered to them; I saw the young one bring out a firkin; and 
               
                  David
                   Evans
               



             held out his hand; and the little one put his hand in his pocket, but whether he received any thing I cannot say;Evans took up the butter, and went down Thames-street; the others followed him; I stopt Evans with the butter on his shoulder, and when they saw me watching them, the prisoner, Willliam Derry, said, d - n your eyes, make haste along, you are both blown; that I am clear of; I stopt him then; the others made their escape immediately through a court in Thames-street; I followed them when I saw assistance coming.

             sworn.
I took charge of the prisoner Evans; the butter and firkin is here.
(Produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER EVANS's DEFENCE.
He speaks false; when I was taken, he asked me what the others had; I said, I did not know.

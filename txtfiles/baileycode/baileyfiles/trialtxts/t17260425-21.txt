             thus depos'd. The Prisoner being out of Service, she came to help me Scower, I went abroad one Day, and left her to look after the House; But when I came back, my Kitchen Door was lockt, and the Key within side. I knockt hard at the Door, and it was a pretty while before she open'd it, but when she did, she went out directly; - I quickly found my Drawers had been broke open, and that my Goods were gone: but I gave notice of it to a Pawnbroker, who stopt them when she came to pawn them. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

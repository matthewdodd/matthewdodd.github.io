            . I keep the Fountain, public-house, opposite the prosecutor's. On the 30th of June, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man pass the prosecutor's door about three yards, and look to see if any body was in the shop; they then returned-the prisoner laid hold of the dress, tore it down with great violence, and gave it to the other man, who put it under his Guernsey-frock; both ran away together. I run over and alarmed the prosecutor, who pursued and brought the prisoner back; the other got away. I am sure the prisoner is the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I was taken, but know nothing of it.

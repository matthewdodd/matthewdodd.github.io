GEORGE TEAKLE
 (police-sergeant H 8.) On the afternoon of the 9th of December I saw the prisoner in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, with a bundle, going along very fast—I asked what he had got—he said he did not know—I asked where he brought it from—he said he picked it up—I asked where—he said, "Just up here"—I took him into custody—it was this coat.





WILLIAM SMITH
. am servant to Mr. Purt, in St. Mary-at-Hill, Lower Thames-street. On the 9th of December I left the White Hart public-house, Kingsland-road, about two o'clock, and went to the back of Shore-ditch Church, to the Red Cow public-house, not Far from Wheeler-street—I left a basket in the cart, and when I came out of the house, about half-past two, I saw the horse-cloth, which I had covered it with, turned up, and the coat gone—it could not have fallen from the cart—this is it.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw two boys running with something, which they dropped; I saw it lying on the ashes; I was walking quite slow when the policeman stopped me.





GEORGE TEAKLE

re-examined. It was wrapped up in a black apron, and knowing he wore one caused me to stop him—it was about a quarter of a mile from the Red Cow.

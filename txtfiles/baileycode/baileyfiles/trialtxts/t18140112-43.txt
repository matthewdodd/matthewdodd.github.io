            . On Tuesday the 28th of December, I saw the prisoner commit the robbery. I saw the prisoner and two more in Holborn; they passed Red Lion-street. There was one person rather taller than the other two, that person was placed at the window of the prosecutor, while the prisoner went to the door; the other went near the curb of the pavement. I saw the prisoner have a pull at a piece of print; a signal came from the one placed at the window, and they separated; they then came back, and took the same stations which they had formerly bad. When the prisoner stepped on the door and where the print was hanging, he gave two pulls, the linen then came down; he then ran across the road, folding it up. I caught him in my arms, and took him to Hatton Garden office. This is the print.
Prosecutor. This print was taken out of my shop on the 28th of December; it is my property; the value is thirty shillings.
Prisoner. Please you my lord, I will ask that gentleman whether he saw me in the shop, or nigh the door.
COURT. He said he saw you at the step of the door.

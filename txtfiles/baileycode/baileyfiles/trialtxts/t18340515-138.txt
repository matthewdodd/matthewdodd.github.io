JAMES COLE. I am servant
 to Mr. Cox, he keeps the Star and Garter, Pall Mall


. On the 10th of May, the prisoner slept in the same room with me - I missed a shirt and a rasor - this is my shirt.
Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How do you know it is yours? A. By the bosom, which is composed of five different pieces - it was made for me - I never saw one made like it - I had some more made at the same time, but there was not linen enough to make the bosom of this, and it was joined - there is no other mark on it - two other persons slept in the room.

             (police-constable C 181). I took the prisoner, and found this shirt on his back - I found on him a duplicate of a dressing cloak, and three half-pence - he said this shirt was his own.

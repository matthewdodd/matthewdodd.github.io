1598. 




HENRY ROWLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing 6 printed books, value 3s., the goods of 



John Taafe; and that he had before been convicted of felony.






JANE TAAFE.
 My son's name is John Taafe—this property is his—he lives at 128, Crawford-street. On or about the 25th of June, in the evening, I lost from the door about half-a-dozen books, a ready-reckoner, and some others—I have never seen them since.





HENRY WIFFIN.
 I live with Mr. Porcher, at 129, Crawford-street. On this Friday evening, about seven o'clock, I saw two boys standing by the prosecutor's house—the prisoner was one of them—his companion took the books, walked away, and handed them to him—there was about half-a-dozen books tied up—I am sure the prisoner was the one that had them, and was with the one that took them—I had seen the other at the shop at about half-past seven in the morning—I followed the prisoner immediately—I did not lose sight of him, and gave him in charge—the other boy had the books, and went up Circus-street.

Prisoner's Defence. On Friday evening I went to tell my father to come home; I had not been out of the public-house, in Oxford-street, a quarter of an hour; I had no boy with me.





EDWARD GRORGE SMITH
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoners former conviction—(read—Convicted 7th Jan., 1845,and transported for seven years)—he is the person.




GUILTY.** Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

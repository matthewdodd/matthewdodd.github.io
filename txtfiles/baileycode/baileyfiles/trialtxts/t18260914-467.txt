JAMES WARD. I live in Jewin-street, Cripplegate


, and am a bricklayer
; the prisoner was apprentice
d to my brother and servant
 to me. On the 3d of September I marked a shilling, with a scratch on the edge, and put it into a waistcoat pocket, on the floor of my room; the prisoner slept in the same room; next morning I missed it; he went out; I got up and followed him; he went to a coffee-shop, and returned; I got an officer, who found the marked shilling on him and some keys.

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found the shilling in his waistcoat-pocket, with a few half-pence.
Mr. WARD. This is the shilling I marked.
Prisoner's Defence (written). I came home on Sunday with a shilling and a sixpence in my pocket, which I put on the drawers, to put into my other pocket in the morning - I was stooping to untie my shoe and picked up this shilling, which I threw on the drawers; and in the morning I took a shilling and a sixpence off the drawers, and thought they were my own.
Mr. WARD. It was impossible that it could have fallen from my pocket; there was no shilling found on the drawers; I put it on the floor carefully; he was in bed before I put it there.

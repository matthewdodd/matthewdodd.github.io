            . I am a bricklayer
, and live in Little Carter-lane


. On the 19th of June, about a quarter past six o'clock, I was in bed and heard a noise in the next room, on the ground floor - I got up and found two men in the room. My son had gone out at five o'clock. I seized one, who was the prisoner - the other ran away. I found the drawers all open, and the property strewed all about the room. These things were on the floor - they were taken from the drawers - he was putting them into a bag.

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner - he said nothing. I searched him and found twelve keys and a knife on him, and a small crow.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was unfortunate, and bought and sold old clothes. I met one Joseph, at the Blue Boar public-house, Rosemary-lane - he told me to meet him at the foot of London-bridge at six o'clock in the morning, which I did. He took me towards Carter-lane - he went up to this room - returned, and took me up with him. He ran out and the gentleman took me.

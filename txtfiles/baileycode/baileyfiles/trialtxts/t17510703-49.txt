George Friend. I lost a brass cock out of my dye-house on friday se'nnight. I sent a servant to enquire at the cock-founders and other places to get it stop'd, &c. and upon that, 
               
                  James 
                  Bartlet 
               



             came and inform'd me he had bought it.

            . The prisoner brought this brass cock to my shop, and said he had it to dispose of. When I ask'd him if it was his own, he said, I don't bring it as a thief. I saw him bring it open in his hands, he said it was his own. I bought it, and gave him 8 s. for it. When I heard from the prosecutor I let him know of it. Produc'd in court, and depos'd to by the prosecutor.

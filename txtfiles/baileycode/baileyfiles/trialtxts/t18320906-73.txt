            . On the 6th of July I was in a carriage in the Strand


, near the end of Norfolk-street; I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Norman's pocket - I got out of the carriage and stopped him; I charged him with taking it - he said he had not, and that he had no handkerchief, but I saw something in his breast, and took out this handkerchief; I left him in charge of Mr. Lucas, and ran after the prosecutor, who came back and identified it.
JOSEPH NORMAN. I live in the Strand, and keep a coffee-shop
. On the morning of the 6th of July I lost this handkerchief, which the officer has.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the Strand; a boy threw it down, and I took it up and put it into my breast.
MR. ROUTH. I am sure the prisoner took it.

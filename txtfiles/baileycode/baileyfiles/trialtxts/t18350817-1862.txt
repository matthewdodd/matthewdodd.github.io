HENRY LONG
. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Nicholls, a pawnbroker, of Gray's-inn-lane. On the 13th of August, these handkerchiefs and shawl were taken from our counter—I received information, and followed Sullivan, and took the handkerchiefs from her—she turned into Baldwin's gardens—I followed her—I then saw Hays, and he followed us—we went on, and when we got to Holborn, I heard some person call out, "He has got it; he has got ir"—I then saw part of this shawl under Hays's arm.

Sullivan. Q. Did you see me in the shop? A. Yes.





THOMAS MASON
. I am a police-constable. I was on duty, and heard that the prosecutor had lost some shawls—I went to Holborn, and saw Hays run from a crowd—I followed him two hundred yards, and took him with this shawl buttoned under his coat.

Hays. Q. Did I not stop the instant you called me? A. No; you ran two hundred yards.





WILLIAM VERTUE
. I am a police-constable. I heard the alarm, and took Sullivan—I found on her a bunch of keys, two rungs, and a box.

Sullivan's Defence. I was very bad, and I had not been out for a fortnight—I went out that day, at eleven o'clock, to go to the doctor; a woman came up to me, and put these things into my hand, and told me to hold them—she said her husnand was running after her, and she was going to pawn them—I saw the ticket on them, but did not know they were stolen.

Hays's Defence. I picked the shawl up.

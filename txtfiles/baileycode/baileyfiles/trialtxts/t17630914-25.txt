            . I live at Tottenham, I deal in coals and corn
; I had information given me by a boy, that this Wood and another had taken two sacks of malt out of a barge of mine, and that Wood had taken out coals; I got a constable, and took him at the ship, there he confessed to me he had taken coals out of my barges, about four bushels; he did declare that Lassene, who lives at Humerton, near the river, did buy coals of him, and before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             he did declare the same, that he set the coals down by Lassene's, and had a pot of beer there at the time.

            . I saw Wood and Radford leave about three bushels of coals, which he took out of the prosecutor's barge, near the other prisoner's house, and I believe he took them in, but I did not see him.

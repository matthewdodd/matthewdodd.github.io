WILLIAM PENNY
(police-inspector, G division.) On the 15th of May, in consequence of information, 1 went to No. 10, Carrier-street, St. Giles's, in company with Redman and Fink, of the same division, and another officer, named Farrar, who did not come into the house—I got there at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock in the morning—I went into the front room on the second floor—the door was locked with two locks, a padlock, and a box-lock—I forced it open with the assistance of the other officers—I went into the room—no one was there—there was a very clear coke fire—I found this pair of moulds, (producing them) on the left hob of the grate, with the impression of two sixpences—two heads on one part of the mould, and two toils on the other—I found nine large spoons, which I believe to be pewter, standing up at the left corner of the fender—the room was furnished—there was a bed there, which appeared as if two people had slept in it.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON.
Q. Were you the person who previously received the information? A. Yes—I got the information from Mr. Powell—that was the source of my information, and no other.

Q. Did you know the room you were to go to? A. Yes—I expected to find the door locked—I expected to find moulds, or something of that kind—I did expect to find a mould, either in pieces or whole, and to find some person there, either at work, or in bed—the door was not bolted—it was padlocked, and had a box-lock, but I expected if any one was in, to find it bolted inside—I expected to find a person outside near the door, with the key.

MR. ELLIS.
Q. Do you mean you expected to find it padlocked? A. Yes, and a man in the street outside, with a key.





HENRY REDMAN
(police-constable G224.) I went with the witnesses to this house, and assisted in searching the room—I found this pipkin containing metal, and in carrying it across the room the bottom fell out—this spoon was in it, which has the appearance of having been used with metal.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON.
Q. You found every thing that would be necessary for the purpose of carrying on the manufacturing of sixpences? A. Yes—the mould, and the materials of which they would be made—the spoon was in the pipkin, denoting that it had been recently used—I saw the moulds there—there was nothing wanting, in my judgment, to denote what was going on.





JOHN FINK
(police-constable G77.) I accompanied Penny and Redman on that occasion—I found, on the right hob of the grate a pair of plaster of Paris moulds, with the impression of two sixpences—I found some spoons by the hob, on the right-hand side of the grate—there was a clear fire.





JOSIAH HANCOCK.
I live at No. 10, Carrier-street, St. Giles's. I occupy the lower part of the house—I let the rest in the middle of November—I let the front room second floor unfurnished, to the prisoner Carter, at 3s. a week—he put the furniture into the room—there were several to assist him—he occupied it, and had many visitors during that time—Cartel sometimes paid the rent, but I received it from different people, but always the name of Carter was inserted in the rent-book—there is only one street-door—I shut it from ten to twelve o'clock at night—I always lock it at twelve o'clock, the latest—I keep the key in my pocket till morning, without any person is out that wants to come in, or any person wants to

go out—the door is ordinarily opened about five o'clock for market people to go to market—sometimes later—it is sometimes shut again—about the latter end of February, the prisoner Simpson came, and rapped at the door—I let him in—he said he wanted to go in to sleep with Carter—I cannot exactly say what time he came—it was at a late hour—the door was fast—he stopped till the 14th of May—that was the last time I saw him—he continually came to the house to sleep, with the exception of a few nights—he generally came in late to sleep, though he was there at all hours in the day—he slept there for the most part—I saw Carter on the 14th of May, about dusk in the evening—he went up stairs—I do not know whether he went to his room—I saw Simpson afterwards, in about two or three minutes—he went up stairs—I did not see either of them go out that night—I went up stairs that night at eleven o'clock, and 1 heard some one in Carter's room—I could not see who it was—the street door was, at that time, locked—I had the key—I did not see either of them leave the house the next morning—I left that morning about ten minutes before ten o'clock—I heard some one up-stairs about five minutes before I went out, and as I went out, I saw Carter looking oat of the window of his own room—I came back to my house in about ten minutes—I found the officers in Carter's room when I came back—I cannot say whether there were three or four officers—they were coming out of the room, just as I got on to the landing—I saw Simpson the next day, the 15th, after the officers had been—he came to the door—I told him I insisted upon his getting the things out of the room, that I would not have them there any longer—I saw Carter a few days after, up by Hyde-park-corner—we went and had a pint of ale with another person he bad in company with him—I had seen the man before—Carter and I came out of the public-house alone, but there was another person standing by who did not join—Carter said, if he was taken, if I would not recognize him aa being the occupier of the room, he would give me 10l., and if that was not sufficient to satisfy me he would sell his clothes, and give me more—I told him I did not want him to sell his clothes, and did not want his money, but if I was called upon, I should state the truth—we went down into the Edgware-road, and I told them I had business to do at home—I took the omnibus, and came home.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON.
Q. I am surprised, that after living with you from November, be should have supposed that if you were asked any thing you would not tell the truth. A. I do not know—my name is not Donohue, nor Donovan—I never went by any other name than Hancock—it was in the rent-book in my father-in-law's name—he took the house, and it went in his name—he put me in possession of it after wards, and then I signed his name—he did not give up the house to me till Carter left—I always signed it in that name—I sell fruit and fish—I have dealt in other things—I buy as well as sell—I buy fish and fruit in season—I have bought cabbages—I swear that I have never bought any thing else for sale besides—I do not keep, a shop—when I have fish I keep a stall outside the door, and when I have fruit I go round with it—I swear I never purchase any thing but fruit and vegetables, and fish in their season—I cannot say how many lodgers I have—sometimes I have more than others—one that may come to-night may go in the mowing—they very seldom do that—I never had any lodgers before the prisoners to be in any way curious lodgers—I have about nine lodgers now—I hive five rooms—there are four for the lodging part—there are two single men, a

GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
(police-constable E49.) I apprehended

Simpson on the 24th of May, in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's—he called to one of his companions, and said, "It is for Billy'scase."





MR. JOHN FIELD.
I am inspector of coin to the Mint—these are plaister-of-Paris moulds intended for the casting of counterfeit sixpences, they have never been used—these spoons are Britannia metal; it is the metal usually employed for making counterfeit coin—the metal in the pipkin appears to be of a similar description—I was present at the examination of Simpson before the Magistrate—this deposition is signed by Mr. Crouch, the magistrate.

Cross-examined by
MR. JONES.
Q. You see that his signature is struck out? A. Yes—I saw it handed across the table to him—I believe this to be his writing—I cannot undertake to swear that this is the paper I saw him sign—I was present at the time. (This deposition was not read.)

MR. CLARKSON
to
JOSIAH HANCOCK.
Q. Do you know whether Donovan is single or married? A. I never knew her to be married—two of the single women had a room to themselves, the first floor front—Donovan slept in her own room, by herself.

CHARLES BRADLEY.
I am in the employ of my cousin, John Henry Bradley, in Plummer's-row, City-road. On Tuesday, the 31st of December, I saw the prisoners lurking about the house—I watched them, and saw Cannon take this clock off a table outside the shop, and hand it to Bradley, who stood at the corner, about two yards off—he ran off with it—I pursued, overtook him, and brought him back to the shop, with the clock under his jacket—this is it—(looking at it.)

——I am a policeman. I took him into custody. Rayner. I did not do it.

RAYNER—

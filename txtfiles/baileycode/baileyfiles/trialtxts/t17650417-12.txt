John Strickland. On the 27th of March I was walking down Fleet-street


, between six and seven in the evening; the prisoner came by me: I felt my coat jirk: I put my hand to my pocket and miss'd my handkerchief: I turned about, and saw the prisoner putting it under his coat: I lifted up his coat, and said, that is my handkerchief; he said it was not, he bought it yesterday: I said, where; he first said in Field-lane, then Fleet-lane, then Field-lane again: said I, I'll go with you to the shop; I went with him to a shop in Field-lane: the people said they never saw him before, nor ever saw a handkerchief of this pattern in their lives: I took him to the Counter, and the next morning before my Lord Mayor; there he said another person took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him, (produced, and deposed to by the letter S. upon it.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming down Fleet-street, a young man walked by me, and gave me the handkerchief in my hand: I clapped it behind my coat, and the gentleman said I had picked his pocket: I never was guilty of any such thing in the world before: I am very willing to go abroad.

            . I live opposite Rouch. About one o'clock, on the 3d of January, I was in my room, saw the prisoner loitering about, and in a few minutes I saw him go into the shop and take a fowl - he ran down Tavistock-street - I went and asked Rouch if he had sold one; he looked, and missed it - I described him to the officer, who took him that day; I have known him a long time, and am quite certain of him.

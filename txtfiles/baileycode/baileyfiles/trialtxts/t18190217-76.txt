            . I am a shipwright
. On the 20th of January I lost my jacket from the saw-pit - I had seen the prisoner in the yard.
JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 20th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in High-street, Shadwell, with the jacket under his arm; knowing him before, I asked him where he got it? he said his shipmate gave it to him at Limehouse, to take on board a ship at the London Docks. I asked him if there was any thing in the pockets? he said No. I found a tobacco-box there - Harper claimed it.

               Transported for Seven Years

                  INCE
               



            . I live in James-street, Craven-street


. On Tuesday, the 29th of September, I came home late in the evening, and went to bed at two o'clock in the morning-every thing was then safe. In the morning I found the windows broken open, and missed the property stated in the indictment. The two tea-spoons belonged to me.
COURT. Q.Who did the time-piece belong to - A. To my brother, 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Ince
               



            . I saw every thing safe the night before.


                  HANNAH 
                  STEPHENS
               



            . I am the prosecutors' servant. I went to bed about two o'clock, the kitchen was then safe; next morning, at eight o'clock, I came down first, found the street - door open, and alarmed Mr. Ince. I then went into the parlour, and found every thing in confusion, every cupboard open, and the property gone. I found the kitchen window open, and the shutter cut. A man could put the time-piece in his pocket.
JANES SHEPPARD. On Wednesday morning, the 30th of September, I was going up Craven-street, and saw the prisoner standing with his back towards mr. Ince's door, a few minutes after six o'clock - I knew him before; he called to me, and said "How are you?" I did not suspect him; he had no bundle with him.
Prisoner. Q. How do you know it was that morning - A. I met the servant next morning, she said they had been robbed.


                  HANNAH 
                  STEPHENS
               



             re-examined. I met Sheppard on Thursday morning, the day after the robbery, and told him we had been robbed.

                  CLEMENTS
               



            . On Wednesday morning, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw a man come from the prosecutor's door, he pulled the door after him, and walked up Craven-street - he had a bottle with him.


                  JOHN 
                  MANSER
               



            . I am shopman to Mr. Welby, who is a pawnbroker. On the day after the robbery the prisoner pledged a salt-spoon with me, and redeemed a watch which he had pledged the night before; in the evening he brought another salt-spoon and two tea-spoons. Having received information, I detained him.


                  JOHN 
                  DAVIS
               



            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. He said he received the spoons of a man whom I knew; I fetched the man to him, he then said he was not the man.


                  CHARLES 
                  INCE
               



             re-examined. The time-piece was worth 4l. in my judgment.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing a marine store dealer's shop, and saw a man, he sold me the spoon, and said if I would meet him in the evening he would sell me some more things. I met him, he sent me to pledge the things, and I was detained.

THOMAS HALEY



, stealing 2 handkerchiefs, value 4s.; the good of 



Charles Willis: having been before convicted.






ANN WILLIS
 I am the wife of Charles Willis. On 10th of April, I put three silk handkerchiefs in my back yard to dry, about ten o'clock—about a quarter to two I missed them—these are them (produced).

Prisoner. There are a good many handkerchiefs alike. Witness. There is no private mark on them, but they are exactly like mine, and I believe them to be those I lost.





MARTHA WEST
 I was at my door, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchiefs from the line in Mrs. Willis's yard and go away with them—I knew him before, and have known his friends for years—I went after him and stopped him—he said he had not got the handkerchiefs—I held him until a policeman came up—the prisoner threw the handkerchiefs in a ditch, and the policeman picked them up—these are them.





WILLIAM LAMBOURN
 (policeman, N 489). I took the prisoner from Mrs. West, and picked up the handkerchiefs—I did not see who threw them down.





GEORGE COLLINS
 (policeman, M 59). I produce a certificate—(read-Thomas Haley, convicted Feb. 1848, of larceny, having been before convicted—confined one year.) I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person—I have had him in custody three times.




GUILTY
 ** Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

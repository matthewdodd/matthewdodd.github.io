ELIZABETH LANGLEY
. I am the wife of James Lake Langley, a tailor, who lives in Church-street, Minories. I was in the shop on the 9th of October, and saw the prisoner looking in at the window for some time—he then went suddenly to the door and pulled this kerseymere down, and broke the chain it was fastened to—he ran away—I pursued, calling "Stop thief"

he threw the cloth down—I took it up, and he was brought back directly——he had carried it about a hundred yards—this is it—(looking at it.)

Prisoner. I had nothing to do with it, I was going home.




GUILTY.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

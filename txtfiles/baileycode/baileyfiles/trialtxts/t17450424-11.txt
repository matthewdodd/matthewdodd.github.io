             . I was setting in my shop about eight in the evening : 
               
                  Dorothy 
                  Buckles 
               



             came in and asked if I sold handkerchiefs. I said , I believed I had none at her price, and bid her not tumble the goods. Then Booth came in, and repeated the words, don't tumble the gentlewoman's goods. She bid me a shilling for a handkerchief, and I bid her go about her business: then Dorothy Buckles tore a handkerchief off a line in the shop window; and they both run away. I called out to some people to stop them, and they were taken.

            . I was standing at my master's door (a bookseller at Gray's Inn gate


, in Holburn


 ) and heard Mrs. Griffiths cry out she was robbed. I saw the two prisoners run as hard as they could. I took hold of Buckles, and desired a young gentleman to hold her while I went after the other; and I took her: they said they had no money. Buckles owned they went out with an intent to steal. Booth said she was in the shop. Both 

               Guilty

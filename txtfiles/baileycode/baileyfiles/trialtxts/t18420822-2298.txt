Whipped.






GEORGE COURTICE
. I work with Daniel Butler, at Hammersmith. I missed a pair of shoes on the 13th of August, which hung at the door-post outside—these now produced are them.





WILLIAM POTTER
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Old Brentford. Between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday night, the 13th of August, Turner offered these shoes to me—I asked whose they were—he said his mother's—I said he must go with me—I went out, and he ran from me—I caught him, and took him to the station—he laid hold of Davis, and brought him in too—as Turner came along, he called out some other name in the crowd.

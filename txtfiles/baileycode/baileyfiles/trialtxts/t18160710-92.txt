            . I am a bricklayer; this man came by me, with the two pigs, and I asked him if they were to sell; he said they were, and wanted twenty one shillings for the larger. He did not take the money then. I bid him nineteen shillings, and he went away; but he came afterwards and took the nineteen shillings; I am sure the prisoner is the man.

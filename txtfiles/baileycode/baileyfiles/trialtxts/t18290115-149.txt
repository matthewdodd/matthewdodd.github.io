            , the goods of

                  Bright
               




            .


                  WILLIAM 
                  BRIGHT
               



            . I lost all these articles in three boxes on the 22d December from my master's, Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Mills
               



            ; I had lived with his mother in King-street, and William Ashton went with me to help me carry my three boxes to Mr. Mills, No. 71, Wardour-street


 - I carried two and he one; he stood opposite while I took them in - this was the Saturday before Chrismas-day; on the Wednesday following I went to fetch them, and they were gone -I have never seen the things since; no one knew where the things were but him - I knew Francis by sight.


                  JOHN 
                  MILLS
               



            . I live in Wardour-street. On the 20th of December three boxes were brought to my place, and Iput them into my shop - on the Monday, about twelve o'clock, Francis came and said he came from William for the three boxes; I refused to give them up without a note- in about three hours he brought me this note, and said the prosecutor was sorry he could not come himself - I then delivered them up. (Note read.)
SIR; - Please to send by the young man that came this morning, three boxes, for I have got a situation and I don't think I shall have an opportunity of coming myself.


                  WILLIAM 
                  KNIGHT

                  BARNARD
               



            . I saw Francis take the boxes away, and give 
               Mills
             the note.


                  JAMES 
                  BROWN
               



            . I am an officer. On the 24th of December I received information, and went to a house in Bethnal-green where the prosecutor lodged; and, from the conversation I had with him, I apprehended the prisoners.


                  JAMES 
                  FITZPATRICK
               



            . I went with Brown and took the prisoners.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BRIGHT
               



             re-examined. Q. Is that note written by you? A. No; I never authorized Francis to get my clothes - I had seen him before; he often used to come to the house I lodged at in company with Ashton - Ashton came and asked me whether my name was William Bright or 
               
                  William 
                  Knight
               



            ; I told him it was William Bright - he said he had bet a pot of beer on it with a drover named Saul; Francis was not present - he came in and went out again directly; this was about ten o'clock on the Monday that the things went.
FRANCIS' Defence. At the time the witness says I received the boxes, I was with the prosecutor - about three o'clock I said I was going to boy a second-hand shirt; I went and bought one, washed myself and put it on.

            . Q. What name did Francis give you? A. He only said he came from William - I knew him by no other name.

            . Q. You knew Francis as well as you did Ashton? A. Yes, I have seen him - Francis did not know from me where my boxes were; I have no idea whose writing this note is - Francis can read and write to.

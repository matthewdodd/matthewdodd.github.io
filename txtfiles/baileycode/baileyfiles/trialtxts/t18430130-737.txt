JOSEPH SKINNER
. I live in Whitechapel-road. Between four and five o'clock on the 27th of Jan., I was passing Harrow-alley, Houndsditch, and felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief, concealing it—he pushed into a crowd—I pursued, and collared him—I called, "Police," but no one came near me—a number of his own people came round, and ill-used me so much, that I was forced to let him go—I gave information, and the following day I heard the officer had got him—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I got my handkerchief as I returned from the crowd.

Prisoner. As I was going up stairs last Saturday night, the officer took me.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

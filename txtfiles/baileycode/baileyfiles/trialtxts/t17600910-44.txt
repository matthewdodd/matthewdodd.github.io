            .
Q. How much did she say she had sold to her?
Duberly. She said, she had sold to her five linings; I went, as directed by Brooks, and found them; and said to Newberry, I have catched you at last ( produced in court) we call it brown Hessian; the other prisoner Brooks said, this belongs to me.

Q. Are there not other people that work for the army besides you?
Duberly. Yes.
Council. I suppose they make use of the same sort of materials?

Duberly. Yes, the same as I do.
Q. Then how do you know that these pieces were taken from you?
Duberly. I know it by the confession of Brooks.
Q. Will you take upon you to say the piece produced is your property?
Duberly. They are of the same sort that I lost, and the other prisoner Newberry own'd she bought the bays.
Q. Whether you found any part of the red bays at Newberry's?
Duberly. No, she said she had not got them; but she said she had bought them of the prisoner Brooks.

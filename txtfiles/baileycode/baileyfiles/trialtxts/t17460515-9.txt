Burton. My Wife told me the Hedge was robb'd. The Things were lost from Finchley-Common; they were hung out upon the Hedge. I pursu'd him and took them from him.
[The Prisoner had no Witness to speak for him, and seem'd a poor, Vagabond
 Creature. He said he had serv'd his Majesty 25 Years.



               Guilty

The Prosecutors depos'd, That they and the Prisoner being Harvest People, lay in the same Barn, and that the two former having work'd together as Partners, as they were kneeling upon the Bed, were disputing about parting the Money, the Prisoner coming to them, pretended to play with them, putting her Hands down their Backs, and up their Coats, which caused the Money to drop out of one of their Bosoms, and went out, they not suspecting she had got their Money; but searching for it all over the Bed, found it was gone.
The Vestry Clerk of Kensington being called to her Character, depos'd, That she had a very bad one, and had been before at the Whipping-Post for Pilsering; the Jury found her 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

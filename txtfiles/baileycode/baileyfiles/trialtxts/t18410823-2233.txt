THOMAS WALKER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of August, 1 cloak, value 10s., the goods of 



Joseph Barnett; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARY BARNETT
. I am the wife of Joseph Barnett, a cooper, and live in Thomas-street, Whitechapel. On the evening of the 7th of August I hung my cloak up behind my parlour door, and on the 11th I missed it.





ELIZABETH LEACH
. I am servant to Mr. Cowderoy, a starch-manufacturer, in Thomas-street. On Friday, the 11th of August, I was at the nursery window, which is opposite Mr. Barnett's—I saw the prisoner go in, and take the cloak, and come out with it—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner. I am not the person. Witness. Yes, he is the person—he had a red neck handkerchief on—there was another with him.

JURY. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Yes, I had seen him, and I watched him.





GEORGE SMITH
 (City police-constable, No. 337.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

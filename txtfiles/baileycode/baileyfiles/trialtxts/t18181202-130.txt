, and live in Holywell-street, Strand


, On the 24th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was alarmed by a quantity of stays falling from the door, inside the shop. I ran out immediately, and saw two young men and the prisoner running together; the prisoner had three pair of corsetts. I caught him immediately, he dropped one pair; I gave him in charge - I missed three pair - the other men got off.

            . I am an iron founder
; I live in Clerkenwell. The prisoner had been my labourer
 ten or twelve months. In consequence of suspicion, on the 5th of April, about ten minutes past one in the day, I watched him as he came from the foundry; I conceived he was more bulky than he ought to be; I asked him what he had got there; he said, iron. I pulled his coat of one side; I saw a piece of iron sticking out of his pocket inside. He begged, for Christ's sake, that I would have mercy upon him, or else he should be ruined.

ESAU HARRIS sworn.
On the 24th of May, about 12 o'clock at noon, I was coming by the end of Fleet-market


, I felt something at my pocket, I turned round and seized the prisoner's wrist, I found my handkerchief was gone, and charged the prisoner with it; he denied it, but said he would pay me for the handkerchief; I told him I would not be paid for it, I must have it, I then saw it lying behind me; Mr. Sullenge came by and persuaded me to take him before a magistrate, which I did.
Was it your handkerchief? - Yes.

I was coming past and saw the handkerchief lying close to the prisoner's heels; there was nobody near but the prisoner, and I and Mr. Harris.
(The handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I never touched the handkerchief, the gentleman would have let me go, but the other man said no, if you cast him you will be rewarded.
(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.)

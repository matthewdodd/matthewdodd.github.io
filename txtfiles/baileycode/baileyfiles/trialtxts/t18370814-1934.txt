WILLIAM SIMPSON
. I am in the employ of George Richard Tempany and another, at No. 22, Holles-street, Cavendish-square. The prisoner was a stranger—on the 17th of August, a little after three o'clock, I saw him come into the inner door, and deliberately pull a coat off the horse—I pursued him up Holles-street—he dropped the coat from under his frockcoat—I ran up Cavendish-square, and he went on to Union-street, where he was taken—I never lost sight of him—this is the coat—he was dressed in a blue frock-coat and velvet collar.





DAVID BENNETT
. I saw the prisoner in Oxford-street—he was running, I pursued and took him.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

            , came into my Chamber, at my House at Barns in Surrey, and acquainted me that my Stable had been robbed the Night before of my Saddle, and Housing, and his Livery Great-Coat; the Saddle only is found: I went to London the next Day, and advertised it and it falling into honest Hands, I heard of it again, at Mr Winthrop's, near the Corner of Hatton-Garden; he told me he bought it of one 
               
                  William

            , within two or three Doors of him; and upon sending to Mr Doleman, he told us very readily how he came by it, that he bought it of the Prisoner; the Monday following, he came to Mr Doleman, to tell him, he should soon have another Bargain for him, and was taken. Mr Standerson, the Stable-Keeper, sent to acquaint me with it; I came to Town, and saw my Saddle at Justice Poulson's; the Prisoner said, he had it of one Week's, otherwise Martin, at Wimbleton.

            . May 25, this Saddle was brought to me to be sold, and my Wife bought it at 7 s. 6 d. I am a Pawnbroker by Trade, and deal in Brokery-Goods - I should not sell the Saddle for above 10 s. 6 d. or may be 13 or 14 s. - it is not the first Saddle I have bought of the Prisoner; I took him to be a very honest Man.

I saw this Saddle hang out one Day at Doleman's Door, and asked him the Price of it, he said, he would have 15 s. for it; I gave him 13 s. for it, and took it Home; seeing theSaddle advertised some Time afterwards. I thought it was the Saddle that I had bought: Says I, I believe this is Esquire Coleburne's Saddle. I went to Mr Sanderson's and asked whether it was Mr Coleburne's, he said it was his; he sent to the Esquire and he came to Town, and I being a Constable went with the Esquire to endeavour to find the Prisoner. Doleman sent me Word he had got the Prisoner at his House; I went and apprehended him.

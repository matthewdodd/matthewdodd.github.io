ALEXANDER ROBERTSON
. I had an appointment in the National provincial Bank of England. I was in Fleet-street on the 4th of April, between seven and eight o'clock—I did not feel any thing; but one of the witness asked me if I had lost any thing—I felt, and missed my handkerchief—it is lost altogether—it was a red and Yellow silk one—I did not observe the prisoner near me—he was taken about three yards from me.





CHARLES THORP
. I am a patrol of St. Bride's I was in Fleet-street, talking to another witness—I saw the prisoner and another well-known

pickpocket, named Martin, coming up—I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and hand it to Martin—I received them both—Martin made his escape—he ran away with it in his hand, and left his hat behind him—he said, "It is no go this time, Thorp."

Prisoner. Q. How do you know that the other got away with it? Witness. Because I saw you give it him.





CHARLES THORP
, Sen, I was with my son, the last witness. I saw the prisoner pick the prosecutor's pocket—i do not know what became of the handkerchief—I went after the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost any thing—he said his handkerchief—I asked him to step back with me, which he did—the officer had the prisoner and the other in hand—the other got away.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Greenwich fair, and got intoxicated. I was about to leave a friend, when the officer came and charged me with picking a gentleman's pocket.

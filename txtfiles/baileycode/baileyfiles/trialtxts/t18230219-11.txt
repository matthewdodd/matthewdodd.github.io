            . I am a packer
, and live in Great St. Thomas Apostle. On the 1st of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Cannon-street


, and felt a catch at my right hand pocket, and immediately felt a touch at my right elbow - I had noticed two boys just before. I felt, and missed my handkerchief - I turned round, and saw the prisoner, and said,
"You have taken my handkerchief, where is it?" he said,
"Oh No, it was the other boy," pointing to the other, who was going on. I was not satisfied, and lifted up his apron, and therefound it - he then said the other boy gave it him; and as I took him to the Mansion House, he said he picked it up.

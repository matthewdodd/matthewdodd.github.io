THOMAS HARRIS. I am a clerk in the Ordinance office
. On the 13th of May I was in Great Russell-street


, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; a person said somebody had taken my handkerchief: I turned round, and saw a boy running away. I have not found my handkerchief - I had used it five minutes before; I believe it was of a greenish colour. The prisoner was taken two or three days after.

            . I am twelve years old, and work in Russell-street, with Mr. Cousins. I saw Mr. Harris in the street - I was on the opposite side, rather behind him, and saw the prisoner pick his pocket of a brownish handkerchief; I knew him before, by seeing him up and down the street; he put the handkerchief into his jacket, and ran away. I hallooed out Stop thief! but he got away; I am sure he is the boy. I described him to my father, who took him afterwards.

            . In consequence of information from my son I took the prisoner two days after; I knew him before, by frequently seeing him about Russell-street.
Prisoner. I did no such thing.

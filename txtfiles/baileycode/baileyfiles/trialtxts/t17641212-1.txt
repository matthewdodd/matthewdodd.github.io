William Wallis. On the 31st of October, between six, and seven in the evening, I felt a hand at my pocket, as I was under Newgate


; the prisoner was then close to me; I saw him put my handkerchief behind him: I spoke to a gentleman to assist me; the gentleman not caring to meddle, I attempted to secure him myself; he made an obstinate resistance; either he or an accomplice struck me with a stick on the head: with assistance I secured him, and took him into a public house. I sent for a constable: in carrying him to Woodstreet Compter, he attempted to get away; we again took him into a public house, and sent for a pair of hand-cuffs; he again struck me a violent blow on the face.

            . I was in Pye-Corner, where the prisoner was secured; I saw him give a handkerchief to another man that struck the gentleman two or three times; then there came assistance; the prisoner and the other man made off, but the prisoner was soon secured.

Prisoner's Defence.
The gentleman said, I believe that is the man, that has got my handkerchief; I said, I'll go along with you any where: they brought me to the Horse-shoe and Magpye in Newgate-street, and searched me, and found nothing upon me.

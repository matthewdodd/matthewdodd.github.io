                  MOORE
               



            . I was servant to Thomas Pashfield Davidson, who lives in Southampton-street, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury


. On the 16th of October I left his service - I left two trunks behind me, containing this property, and went to lodge with Mrs. Hawkes - on the 17th a young woman named Warren, who lodged there, was going to a situation, and wanted a porter to carry her trunk; I was walking with her, and met the prisoner carrying some goods in Portland-street; Warren asked if he knew a porter who could carry her box - he said he would take it for her as soon as he had put down what he had; he was to take her box to Snow-hill; I thought that in his way back he could fetch my boxes to Hawkes', which I agreed with him to do; and by St. Giles'-church, when he heard where my boxes were, he said to Warren, "I will get you a cab, as you are in ahurry, and I will return with this young woman to get her boxes;" he put her into a cab, with her trunk, and then ran away from me - I waited about five minutes; he did not return, and I took a boy with me to Southampton-street; when I got there I was told a man had fetched my boxes about a quarter of an hour before - I have not found any of my clothes - the cord of my box was found in his apartment; I am certain of his person; my things were worth 7l. 4s.; Keys produced part of a trunk at the office, but I could not swear to it.

            . I am servant at Mr. Thomas Pashfield Davidson's, in Southampton-street. On the 17th of October I opened the door to the prisoner, who asked for the young woman's boxes - I had only come to the place a quarter of an hour, and being a stranger, mistress took the candle, and took him to where the boxes were - I remained at the door till he went out with them; I cannot swear to his face, but think the prisoner as much like him as possible - I believe he is the man.

                  KEYS
               



            . I am an officer. I received information, and from the description the prosecutrix gave me I took her into Well-street, and she saw the prisoner coming up the street - he is a cab-driver; she pointed him out without my speaking to her - I said, "Is your name Rutlidge?" he said Yes; I asked if he had not worked for Mr. Paul somewhere; he said that was his business - I asked where he lived; he said that was his business; I said, "Well, it is my business to take you into custody, you are charged with stealing a young woman's box" - he said, "I know nothing about it;" I took him to the prosecutrix in the street, and said, "Did you ever see this young woman before?" he said, "Never in my life;" she said he was the man - I could not find where he lived, but his wife came to see him in prison - I followed her to a house in the Seven-dials, went into the house, and she directed me to No. 96, Tottenham-court-road; I now know the prisoner lodged there - I found there a bit of a trunk, broken up, and in a basket on the landing-place I found some cords, and a pair of white trousers; the prosecutrix had described him as wearing dark trousers - I afterwards went again, and found a cord, which appeared to have been round a box - I went to the prosecutrix, and she identified the cord by a piece of ribbon tied to it.

                  HAWKES
               



            . I live in Oxford-market. Warren and Moore lodged with me - I recollect a man coming for Warren's box; I noticed that he had two black eyes- I believe the prisoner to be the man; Moore's boxes were not brought to my house.


                  CATHERINE 
                  MOORE
               



            . I positively swear he is the man; one of my trunks was corded, and a piece of black ribbon was tied to the loop at the end, as I had not sufficient cord, and here it is now.
Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent, which I can prove.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  HAGAN
               



            . My husband is a marble-mason, and lives at No. 61, Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner lodges in the next room to us - I kept my clotheslines on the landing-place; the cord the officer found in the basket was mine; there were several in the basket -I had had the cord several months; I do not know where I got it - there were several pieces tied together - it was a drying line.
Q. Was it twopenny cord, or what? A. I cannot say - nor what sort of hemp it was made of; I do not know whether I tied it myself - some was like twine, and some rather thicker, like a bedstead cord - there was something at the end of it, I cannot say whether it was black tape or silk; I told the officer it was mine, and he did not take it away the first day; I cannot swear the cord produced is mine - it is like it; I swear the cords on the landing were mine; I cannot say whether I had had it three, five, or six months.


                  FRANCIS 
                  KEYS
               



            . I found the cord against the room door; I afterwards found the prisoner and witness were acquainted, and went and got it; the prisoner had two black eyes, and rags round his fingers when I apprehended him.


                  CATHERINE 
                  MOORE
               



            . The man who took my trunks had two black eyes.

            . I did not look him in the face; he came into the house in great haste, before he was asked.

            . Q. Had the prosecutrix hired any body else to fetch her boxes? A. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Warren
               



             had gone out and hired a ticket-porter from the Green Man, but they met the prisoner before he came, and that porter did not have the box, for when he came the prisoner was sitting in my room, and they sent the ticket-porter away.


                  CATHERINE 
                  MOORE
               



            . The prisoner said as soon as he had put down the things which he had, he would come; Warren ought to have been at her place at eight o'clock, and it was near nine; she went to the Green Man to speak to a porter, and when we brought him the prisoner had come; the ticket-porter never knew where my boxes were; I told the prisoner twice that they were at No. 1, Southampton-street.

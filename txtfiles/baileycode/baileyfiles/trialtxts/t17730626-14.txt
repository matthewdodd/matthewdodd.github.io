Mr. Vere's gardener deposed, that the fowls were in the yard safe on the 9th of May, at seven o'clock; that the hen was sitting upon some eggs; that the next morning they were missed from the roost, a house almost adjoining to the dwelling house.
Another of Mr. Vere's servants deposed, that they were locked up safe over night, and in the morning the house door was found broke open.
A watchman deposed, that at the top of Tottenham-court-road; he stopt the prisoner with a bag at his back, which contained five turkeys, two ducks, and a hen, and eleven eggs in his pockets; there were also found a tinder-box, some matches, and a picklock; that the same morning about eleven o'clock Mr. Vere's servants came to Justice Welch's, where the prisoner was brought; there they saw these turkeys and other fowls; (the fowls were produced and deposed to by Mr. Vere's servant, as his master's property.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going to Harrow: they lay in a barn in the way; two men came in; they were laughing about the plunder they had got; they talked to one another about the dog, whether they were afraid of it; the other said no, he knew him, he was not afraid; they went away and left them, thinking they would be acceptable to my children, who had no victuals to eat; I took them intending to carry them home.

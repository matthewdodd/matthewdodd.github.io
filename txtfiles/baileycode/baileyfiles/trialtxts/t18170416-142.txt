            . I am a licenced bumboat-man. I bought the boat of the prisoner for 2l. 5s. - he was at Ratcliff-cross, just by the shore-it was afloat. I had seen it there for sale, three or four days before. I heard the prisoner tell several people that he wanted to sell it. After I bought it, it remained there, and Millet claimed it. I found the prisoner out - I am sure he is the man I bought it of - He gave me a receipt for it (produced and read)-it is signed "

. On the 24th of October the prisoner came to my shop door, about nine o'clock in the evening, to look at a cloak; my young man went to speak to him - he then went to another part of the shop to look at some more cloaks; he said there were none large enough for him - he then left, and we missed a piece of lawn; I followed him, and the Police-constable took him - he was brought back; he denied having the lawn, but it was found on him - he then said he took it from the floor of the shop.

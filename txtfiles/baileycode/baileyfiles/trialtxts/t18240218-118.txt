. On Saturday night, the 14th of February, my servant alarmed me. I went up to my bed-room, which is the first floor front room - found one of the drawers a little open, and linen taken out and strewed under the bed - I went to the window and found the prisoner on the leads over the tap-room; both windows were open. I collared him, pulled him in and brought him down stairs - and four spoons were found on him, which were taken from the drawer; also a skeleton and latch key.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am servant to Mr. Church. On Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, I locked the bedroom door; and about eight o'clock, took the children up to bed, I found the door open - somebody pushed against it. I gave an alarm - heard somebody cross the room - found the door open, and linen about.

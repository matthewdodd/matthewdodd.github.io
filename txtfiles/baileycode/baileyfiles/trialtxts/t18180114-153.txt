            .
THOMAS BURLTON. I am a pawnbroker, and live at East Smithfield. On the 2d of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner offered to pledge a shirt and a silk handkerchief, which he said were his own, and that he had bought them of a man who lodged with him. I suspected him, and detained him. Mr. Acland afterwards claimed the property.

JAMES FINN
 (police-constable N 58.) On Wednesday night, the 27th of May, I was on duty on Lea-bridge. I know Mr. Wick's wharf at Leabridge—the prisoner Truman was not in his service at that time—he had left about a fortnight before—he lives two hundred yards from Wick's what and Callow within four or five houses; Hewitt is a cow-keeper, and lives at Hackney—about ten o'clock that night, I was passing the house of Truman—I saw the horse and cart standing at the gable end of Truman's house—there was a paling between me and where the horse and cart were standing in Bainbridge's yard, the stone-mason's—I looked over the paling, and saw the three prisoners—they had a sack, which they were in the act of lifting into the cart—I saw it was full of something—I heard Hewitt say, "Throw the net over the cart, and cover it over"—I had not known who Hewitt was till he spoke—when he made that observation, I called out, "Is that Mr. Hewitt?"—he made no reply, but turned his head towards me—I have known him four years and a half—I never knew he was deaf—after that I called out again rather louder," Is that you, Mr. Hewitt?"—he got into the cart very quickly, and drove off as fast as the horse could go—the other two prisoners stopped where they were—I pursued Hewitt from Truman's house, about half a mile; when I got up to Clapton-gate, there being a delay, the gate being shut, by that means I overtook him—I then asked what he had got in the cart; he said, "Malt "—I asked where he got it from; he said, "From Truman's"—I asked where Truman got it from; he said, "You are not going to stop me, Firm "—" Yes, "said I," I am going to stop you"—I took him into custody—" Don't, Finn, "said he," it will be the ruin of me; my customers in all Hackney will see me going to the station-house, and I shall be ruined for ever—I will give you any thing, only don't take me to the station-house"—I said I would take him to the station-house—he said, "Let me take it back again to Truman's"—I took him and the malt to the station-house—he did not at all attempt to run away—when I took him to the station-house, there were five sacks of malt in the cart lying down, covered over with a net, the same as if it had been pigs, or any thing else of that kind—about eleven o'clock the same night, I went to Truman's house, and found him at home, sitting by the fire-side—Meredith, who was with me, took him into custody—I left him in the hands of Meredith, while I went to take Callow, who lives at the fifth house adjoining Truman's—he was in bed—I knew Callow before—I know he was very deaf—the serjeant took him into custody.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you speak as loud, when you spoke to one of the prisoners, as you have to-day? A. I spoke about as loud the first time, and louder the second—I do not say that Callow could hear me—I returned in about an hour—Truman was sitting by the fire—the house was shut—his daughter opened the door—he pertended to be asleep.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. It was about ten o'clock, when you were at the pales? A. Yes; I was there two or three minutes altogether.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS
Q. Have you not forgotten something

that Hewitt said when he told you it would be his ruin? A. He might say something else—he said some words to that purpose—he did say, "You have known me long enough"—I had known him four years and a half—I knew nothing against him before—he said he bought it of Truman.





THOMAS MEREDITH
 (police-constable N 226.) I was at the station-house on the night of the 27th of May, when Finn came with Hewitt and the horse and cart—I went, by the inspector's direction, to Truman's house, and told him I wanted him about some malt which he had sold to Hewitt—he said he had not sold him any malt, nor any thing, and he had not seen him—I said, "Are you sure you have not seen him?"—he said, "Yes"—he then afterwards said he had seen him, but it was at Hackney, in the day, but he had not seen him at all that evening, and he knew nothing about the malt—as we were going along the Lea-bridge-road, he said, "Let me see; what is it you want me for?*—I said, "I have already told you"—he said, "It is a bad job; it will make my children all go mad"—shortly after that conversation, we were overtaken by the other officer with the other prisoner—we got on to Back-lane, and Truman there said, "I shall go this way—you may go which way you like;" and ran off—I pursued him for about a hundred and fifty yards—I then caught him again—when we got to the station, I heard Hewitt say to Truman, "You know I bought the malt of you"—Truman said he knew nothing at all about it—I heard the inspector talking to Truman, and heard Truman say be had had it in his possession about five weeks, and it was brought to his house by some one, but he was not at home at the time—the inspector asked him who brought it—he said, "I won't tell yon," or something to that effect.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your inspector's name? A. Mr. Redford—he is not here—he is not a witness in this case—I told the Justice all this conversation between Truman and the inspector, on the first examination, but that was not taken in the deposition—the Justice's clerk was there—I was in the witness-box—he was underneath—he was writing while I was giving my evidence—I do not know whether he was writing my evidence—at the second examination, I signed this paper, which was read over to me—I did not mention about the conversation between the inspector and Hewitt—I did not say they had omitted something—I knew Truman by sight, and knew where he lived—I took him about eleven o'clock.





ROBERT MESSENGER
 (police-serjeant M 1.) I went with the other officers—I have heard their evidence, and as far as I was present it is true—I took Callow to the station—I found he was deaf—I spoke to him very loudly—I asked him if he had seen Hewitt that day—he said he had not—when we were at the station, I heard the inspector tell him he was there respecting some malt—he said he knew nothing about any malt—I heard Hewitt say he bought the malt of Truman, that he had let him have two pigs at 13s. each, and he was to pay the remainder of the money in the morning, and return the sacks—he stated the price was three guiness a quarter—I heard the inspector ask Truman some questions, but I cannot exactly say what—Truman said the malt was left at his house—I heard what was stated by the last witness—they were the words, as nearly as possible.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What were the words? A. He said it was left in his absence; but whether he said he did not know

the man, or he would not tell, I cannot say—that is all I heard—the inspector is not here.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q, Who was present? A. The inspector, the officer, and the three prisoners—Callow is excessively deaf—I cannot say whether he heard all that was said—I know the word "malt," was mentioned—the sacks that were found in the cart were taken to the station—they were fastened up.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Hewitt said all through that he bought it of Truman? A. Yes.





JOSEPH ANSELL
. I am foreman to Mr. William Cater, a master, living at Ware, in Hertfordshire. His barges go to Wick's wharf, on the rivet Lea, once or twice a week—he sends up his corn to London, through Wick's wharf, and from thence it is sent out in sacks—Truman and Callow were employed there—the waggons are loaded from the barges late at night sometimes, and it remains on the wharf all night—we do not have any body on the wharf to watch it—it goes away in the morning, sometimes by four or five o'clock—it would be the duty of Truman and Callow to go with it to shoot it out—they live near the wharf—during April and March we sent from Ware to Lea Bridge many quarters of malt—we had recently before that purchased 600 new sack—they were warked was on the top, and a dot resembling a star, but it did not fill up well On the 13th of March, we had occasion to bring 600 quarters of malt to Messrs. Barclay's, the brewers—and after the sacks had returned, we had them counted, and missed five of them, and we have the same, number now, we still miss five;—Truman and Callow were working at Wick's at the time the sacks were returned—I have since seen five sacks in possession of the officer; they are my master's—they are marked as master's, and they were tied with a hank knot—I have examined these five sacks; they have been untied and tied again—the malt very much resembles my master's.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you present in March, when the sacks were counted? A. Yes, the men counted then—every time they made a score they said "tally," and I made my tally, and there were five missing—there might be a mistake in counting—I went to the wharf to ask Mr. Wicks about them—I knew that Truman and Callow were in his service—I cannot say whether they were dismissed before May—this malt was never missed, and there was never any complaint from Barclay's—it sometimes happens that sacks are left behind and accounted for afterwards.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. I suppose the six hundred sacks were used after the 13th of March? A. They could not be all used; for five were missing—the others were used—other maltsters tie their sacks in the same way.

MR. CLARKSON., Q, Do you know of any persons who send their malt in sacks marked W C W? A. No—the sacks have been counted since the 13th of March, and five were missing.





WILLIAM CATER
. I am the prosecutor. I have looked it the five sacks taken from the cart—I swear to them, and them alt resembles that which I sent on the 13th of March, and since—it ia Ware-dried malt—other maltsters make the same ties as we do, but no one sends his malt in sacks with W C W on them—I am in the habit of going to other brewhouses—it is the practice to count the sacks after they are emptied—they might be robbed every time.

Cross-examined by
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has this malt been accounted for to

Barclay's? A. Yes; but in a load which I sent before—the parties have called on me for the deficiency.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you been at Barclay's brew-house when malt of yours has been delivered? A. Yes—it is the practice of brewers to count the sacks after the malt is shot.

Truman's Defence, I never worked for Mr. Barclay, and never was in his brewhouse—I picked up these sacks about the middle of May, on the towing path, at Old Fordlock—I had been authorized by Ansell to look after his sacks—I found one some time before, which I gave up to him, and was going to give these to him.





JOSEPH ANSELL

re-examined. I have desired him to do so, and he gave me one once—I told him we had lost five sacks after we missed these and I would be obliged to him to look out for them.

Hewitt's Defence. I bought the malt of Truman, and gave him three guineas a quarter for it—I did not run away—I walked out of the yard—there were some trees in the road—the horse shyd at them, and I hit him two or three times—when I got through the turnpike, I was stopped.
(Ann Scott, cow-keeper of Lea-bridge, and John Driver, tailor, of Enfield-highway, gave Truman a good character; Charles Buck, bricklayer, of Morning-lane, Mr. Garratt, a cow-keeper, William Alford, a broker, Josiah Harding, an attorney, William Wordsworth, oil and colourman, William Heath, of Hackney-grove, George Wade, a gardener, of Brooksbywalk, James M'Donald, a linen-draper, John Sinclair, a market gardener, at Hackney, Francis Romsey, a furrier, Richard Martin, a linen-draper, and William Bell, jeweller, Church-street, Hackney, gave Hewitt a good character.)

. On the 9th of October, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner bolt out of my shop; I came into the shop, and saw her going down the street - I ran, and overtook her at the corner of Cranbourne-passage; I charged her with robbing me - she said, "No, I have not;" I said, "What is this under your shawl?" and I found my boots there - I brought her back, saw a Policeman, and gave her in charge; I had not known her before; I missed a pair of boots from the shop.
Prisoner. Q. Did I leave the shop? A. Yes, and you afterwards said you took them only to look at - these are the boots.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had gone to purchase a pair of boots, and had not left the shop when she was taken.

I am a constable, I took the prisoner coming from London-bridge, about eight in the morning on the 28th of October, I met the prisoner and another man looking at the windows of the shops, and I suspected them; I followed them up Gracechurch-street


, I saw them stop under a gateway, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, and was in about a minute, and came out with a box of tea on his head, I took him in Leadenhall-market; I said, what is that; he said, what is that to you.
(The box produced and deposed to.)

            .
The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoner having been her Char-woman
, she intrusted her in the Room where the Money was in a Chest, and that leaving her alone in the Room on the 20th of August, when she came home she could not find the Key of her Chest, upon which she sent for a Smith to break it open; which done, they miss'd the Money, which she was positive was in the Chest two or three Days before, and that suspecting the Prisoner she charg'd her with it, who after some hesitation confess'd the Fact, and return'd the Money which she had left out of that which she took from the Chest, amongst which was a Spanish Bit, about 6 d. value, which the Prosecutor knew to be her own. The Fact appearing very plain, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d
            .

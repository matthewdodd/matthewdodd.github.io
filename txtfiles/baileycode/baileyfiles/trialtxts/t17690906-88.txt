            . I live in Gray's-Inn-Lane
. I let the prisoner a lodging the latter end of July, and about the 21st of August, I found he had put a padlock on the door. I got a ladder, and got in at the window; when I found the room was stripped of the things laid in the indictment. I took the prisoner up the 2d of this instant. I found the two blankets, a pair of curtains, and tea-kettle, at his lodgings in Diet-street. (Produced and deposed to.)

            . The prisoner came and took a lodging of me this day three weeks in Diet-street. He told me he had these things in pawn. I paid the money to the pawnbroker for them.

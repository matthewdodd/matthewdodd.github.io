STEPHEN WARREN DEVEREUX. I am a baker
, and live in High-street,Wapping


. I went to bed on Saturday, the 2nd of August, about twelve o'clock - I was not the last person up - I was called, up, about a quarter before four in the morning, by a neighbour, and observed the parlour door had been forced open - the shop adjoins the parlour - I had drawers in the parlour where I kept my clothes, and where I put my cash-box in the daytime - on examining the drawers, I found them all open, and all my clothes gone - I then went into my shop, and, on examining the till, I found from 20s. to 30s., in silver, taken - on examining my desk in the shop, I found it broken open, and from 3l. to 5l., in copper, taken from it - I also missed one silver table-spoon, twelve tea-spoons, a silver cream-jug, and a pair of silver sugar-tongs - I have not seen any of them again - I lost a variety of things - when I came to examine the premises, I found they had entered through a bakehouse window, which had been made secure by a carpenter, to prevent my men communicating with the shop - it had been shut up for about four months - the wood work was broken away sufficient to admit a man - I had a sharp dog in the bakehouse, which washis regular place - he was always loose - he was a very sharp dog - I did not hear him bark in the night - I found him tied up with a string, in the morning, to a post in the bakehouse - the dog always barked at a stranger, day or night - I am sure the parlour door was locked overnight - I lost a drab jacket, also a drab waistcoat, a pair of drab trowsers, a black cloth waistcoat, and a valencia figured waistcoat - I missed also two coats, and a pair of boots, which were found on the floor in the water-closet - I missed two yellow silk handkerchiefs - on the Wednesday following, three days after the robbery, I saw some of my articles in possession of Watkins, the horse-patrol, and Mead, the beadle of Enfield - the prisoner, Clay, lived in my service, as a journeyman baker, and quitted a month previous to the robbery - I never saw him on the premises after that - he was familiar with the dog, as it was to and fro while he lived with me- the dog belongs to a brother of mine, and came backwards and forwards to my house, as my brother had left his house- I have seen Clay play with the dog, and give him food to eat - I do not know Stanley.
Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. It was a sharp dog? A. Very sharp - it was a terrier - he always barked at strangers - I never saw Stanley before - I have no reason to suppose the dog was acquainted with him - the window had not been open for four months before, to my knowledge, but I had not examined it for a month since the prisoner lived with me - I have not examined it for four months.
COURT. Q. Did it appear to have been broken open then from the appearance of the wood work? A. It appeared to have been broken before - it appeared an old wound - it was always shut as I passed by in the street and looked at it, I supposed it to be secure.


                  JOHN 
                  MEAD
               



            . I am a beadle of Enfield, which is thirteen or fourteen miles from Wapping. I saw the prisoners at Enfield on Monday evening, the 4th of August, at the Three Horseshoes, by the Chase - when I went on the bowling-green, they were playing at bowls together - it was near upon seven o'clock in the afternoon - I noticed that they were very respectably dressed - I got into conversation with them - they said they had just returned from the Cape - they forced their conversation on me and others without my asking them any question - I had no suspicion of them at that time - I am sure both of them said their dresses were made at the Cape - Stanley had on a drab jacket and waistcoat - he came to me and showed it to me, and said, "I never saw a better bit of cloth" - that it was made for him at the Cape, and the cloth was made at the Cape - Stanley then had it on - Clay had a very handsome valencia spotted coloured waistcoat, on - I noticed it - he said that was manufactured at the Cape - that one of them went there as baker and the other as cook - on the Tuesday evening, about six o'clock, I received information of this robbery, and I went with Watkins, and found Stanley at the Three Horseshoes, the same house as before - there were some people in the parlour, but whether in his company I do not know - Clay was not there - Stanley said that he and Clay had had some words between them, and Clay had taken his jacket away - he said, when I went into the room, "John, I am glad you have come, for Clay has taken my jacket, and I won't leave the house till I get it" - I said, "As you are shipmates, go with me, and I will find it for you" - I took him to the cage, and there told him what I took him for, but not before - I had not said I wanted him - there was nobody but him in the cage, I am positive - he remained in the cage that night - and next morning I and Watkins took him to London - I searched Stanley when I went into the cage, and he had only four half-crowns and some halfpence in his pocket - I took nothing else from him till we got to the Thames police-office - after he had been searched at the Thames police, I returned to the cage the same evening - nobody else was there - the keys of the cage had been at my house all day - nobody could get in without my wife's knowledge - she is not here - on going back, I searched a privy belonging to another cage which Clay had been in - that was next morning (Wednesday) - in the privy among the soil I found a waistcoat, which I took up, and have had ever since - I found nothing there with respect to Stanley - I found a pair of drab trowsers on him at the Thames police-office - he was wearing them - that was part of the clothes which he told me on the Monday, at the bowling-green, were made at the Cape, and he said they were too tight, and would not button by about two inches.
Q. When did you go in search of Clay? A. The same evening, as soon as I had secured Stanley, and found him lying on the bed at his grandmother's - it might be half-past seven o'clock - he appeared to be very tipsy - I tried to make him understand what I wanted, and he could understand - I told him of the robbery at Wapping - he said he knew nothing about it - that he was not there, and knew nobody there - I am sure he said he knew nobody there - I was searching him - I wanted to take his handkerchief off - he took it off himself, and threw it on one side, and in the corner there was a sovereign twisted up - when I was searching him, he was going to strip - he had this valencia waistcoat on then - he swore he would not be pulled about so - I said I would search him - he instantly pulled his shirt over his head, and tore it to pieces - I said,"It is no use, you must go with us" - after that he turned round and jumped into a window, about twelve feet high from the ground, and forced the frame nearly out, but I pulled him back - he had the same waistcoat on as I had noticed overnight at the bowling-green - he had it on then- it was a remarkable pattern, having so many different colours in it - I took him into custody, after searching him, and pulling him back from the window - I examined the bed he was lying upon - when I first saw him, nobody else was on it - I found on the bed a drab jacket which I have had ever since - I have every reason to believe it was the same jacket as Stanley had on at the bowling-green on Monday- it was the same sort of colour - the waistcoat I found in the soil was the one, in my judgment, that Clay had on when he was lying on the bed, and when he was playing at bowls the night before - Stanley had a black waistcoat on, which I took from him, and have had ever since - I found a drab waistcoat in the same room as I found Clay, just down close by the bed-side - on the Monday, when they were talking about their being made at the Cape, I said, "Why, it appears very much like London make," and said, "Why I do not see why they cannot make as good things there as in London; the country is so enlightened" - Stanley said,"The cloth and every thing was made at the Cape."
Cross-examined. Q. Are you a tailor? A. No - I amnot much a judge of clothes - it was a very handsome waistcoat - I did not think any thing of Stanley having money- he had more the night before - their conversation at the public-house was all quite voluntary - I suppose there might be twenty persons there - no questions were asked them - I afterwards went and inspected the prosecutor's premises - I looked at the window; there was no glass in it; it was boarded - I produce the things I found - this waistcoat was taken by me from Stanley, when I brought him down to the cage - I have had it ever since - I found the drab waistcoat just under the window, between the window and the bed that Clay lay on, not more than two feet from the bed.
Clay. He said, at the office, he found the other drab waistcoat on a mangle, where my aunt lodges, which is about a mile from where I was taken. Witness. I did not say so - I never thought of such a thing - there was no mangle there at all, that I know of - I am quite sure I found the drab waistcoat in the room where I found him on the bed, and it was doubled up.
COURT. Q. You have produced a valencia waistcoat found in the soil? A. Yes; he had it on when I apprehended him - he tore it to pieces in the cage - I found it torn in the morning - I am certain it is the same waistcoat which he wore on the Monday and the Tuesday when I apprehended him, from the make and pattern of it, he was so particular in showing it to me - it is a very curious pattern and collar - when I took him it was whole - he did not rip it up when he jumped up at the window.


                  RICHARD 
                  WATKINS
               



            . I am a Bow-street horse-patrol. When Clay was apprehended, he took a handkerchief off his neck, and threw it down - this was at his grandmother's, Mrs. Thorogood, before, he was taken out of the room - I have had that handkerchief ever since - in the corner of it, I found a sovereign: about three quarters of an hour after, I told Clay I had found a sovereign in his handkerchief, and he said, "I had no handkerchief on, nor yet a sovereign" - I have a pair of trowsers which I took from Stanley - they were taken off him the next day at the Thames police-office - I have had them ever since - I told him to take them off, which he did - after taking them off, he said that when they got off the coach in Bishopsgate-street, Clay gave him the clothes, and said to him, "Do not you say you had the clothes from me?" - I produce the handkerchief and trowsers which I took from Stanley - this is the handkerchief the sovereign was tied up in - here is a silk handkerchief which his aunt gave me, and which the prosecutor claims.
Clay. I never told him I had no handkerchief on at the time he took me - he never spoke to me in the watch-house about a sovereign and handkerchief. Witness. I did, an hour after, and he denied having a handkerchief or sovereign.
Cross-examined. Q. When you apprehended Stanley, he went quite quietly with you? A. He did; he did not know what he was going about.


                  ELLEN 
                  THOROGOOD
               



            . I am a widow, and live at Enfield. I am Clay's aunt. On the Sunday before they were taken, the two prisoners and another man came to my house - the other man went away - he was a stranger; I do not know his name - it was between twelve and one o'clock, as well as I can guess - they dined at my employer's, where I work, and both stopped there that night - they came together to me - I gave Watkins a handkerchief - Henry Stanley put that handkerchief on my neck, on the Sunday night, and said, "I give you this handkerchief" - I said, "I do not want it, young man; keep it yourself" - I cannot swear to the handkerchief - because I did not undo it, and never saw it since - the one I gave Watkins was the one I got from Stanley.
Cross-examined. Q. Have you always told the same story about Stanley giving you the handkerchief? A. Yes; I never asked who it was gave it to me, because I could not remember - I have been in the prison once to see the prisoner - his mother-in-law asked me to call - I did not ask that question, when I went - Stanley wanted me to say it was Clay - I am in the employ of Mrs. Crofts, a laundress- she was not at home when the prisoners slept there - the master of the house was, and he allowed them to sleep there - they came to the house between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can guess.
MR. DEVEREUX re-examined. This valencia waistcoat is mine, I am sure of it from the size, it being so small - I am very small - and from the colour of it, but it has been washed since - I had a waistcoat of this sort on the Saturday night before the mischief was done - this agrees with it in pattern, shape, and quality - I have worn this jacket nearly three months, and know it by the collar, buttons, and the length of the arm - I cannot positively swear to this drab waistcoat - I had one of this description, a new one, in my drawer, which was taken out that night, but I had not worn it - it was of this quality and stuff - I have not tried it on - I know these trowsers produced by Watkins perfectly well, by two marks on the knees, which I had done with tar - I have had them in my possession about twelve months - the marks have been there a month- I ran against a tar barrel - I had not worn them for nearly a month - I had seen them in the drawer within three days - I believe this handkerchief to be mine - I bought the piece, and have the fellow handkerchief in my pocket - the one has been washed which I produce, the other is perfectly new - I have no marks on them - I believe this black waistcoat to be mine by the size, not having any marks - I had one of the sort, and missed it among the rest.
Cross-examined. Q. It is four months since you had seen the window fastened? A. Yes; it was fastened with a padlock and staple - it was wood work - I found a piece of wood broken off where the padlock was - it appeared as if it had been done before.
Q. Could it be done by a person coming to the house in the daytime, without making much noise? A. Yes; it might - my shop is under the same roof with my dwelling-house - it joins my parlour.


                  SAMUEL 
                  HANCOCK
               



            . I am foreman to Mr. Swift, a tailor, in Houndsditch. I know this black waistcoat - I cut it out, and know it was made for the prosecutor - I have no doubt of that - this drab waistcoat is my cut - it seems to have been worn very little - it was made for Mr. Devereux - I have not a doubt about it.
Cross-examined. Q. You have seen the whole bundle of things produced? A. Yes; I should say it was not more than one man could conveniently carry as a parcel.


                  ALEXANDER 
                  McEWEN
               



            . I am a tailor. I made thisdrab waistcoat for Mr. Devereux - I have not a doubt of it.
Stanley's Defence. I bought the things of the young man who was with Clay - I am quite innocent.
Clay's Defence. I had no young man with me at all when I saw Stanley.
STANLEY -

            . Aged 25.

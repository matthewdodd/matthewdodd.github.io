            . I live at the Guy of Warwick, in Warwick-lane, Newgate-street


. On Tuesday night the 8th of this month when I shut up at night, I missed a silver tankard; it was advertised afterwards by Marks the Jew; I went to his house, and saw the tankard; I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, in my life before.

            . As I was coming along Bevismarks, yesterday was a week, I saw the prisoner walking with a tankard under his arm; he asked a man to buy it; he asked a guinea and a half for it; the man said he would not buy it because he did not believe he came honestly by it; he went away, and I followed him; he shewed it to another man, and that man said if he came honestly by it he would give him 4 s. for it; I secured him and I gave the tankard to Marks.
- Marks. Levi gave the prisoner in charge to me, and gave me this tankard; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

I put my foot against the tankard as I was coming up some steps near the Fleet-market; it was under some straw.

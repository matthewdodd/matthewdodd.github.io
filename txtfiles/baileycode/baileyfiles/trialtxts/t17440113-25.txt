            . The beginning of November the Prisoner came to lodge in my house, I lost these things which she had the use of, she went away on a Sunday morning about 5 or 6 weeks ago, she took these goods and the key of the lodging along with her; she sent the key back in a penny post letter, and said she would come and make all things easy, but she did not come.
Q. How long was it after she went away that she sent the key?
Smith. About a week.
Q. How do you know but somebody else had been in the room?
Smith. The door was locked when I received the key, and when I went in I missed the things. - I never spoke to her till last Thursday was sev'nnight, and then she owned she had pawned them.
Q. Were these things let to her as part of the furniture of her lodging?
Smith. Yes.
Prisoner. The pot never was in the room, and she said as I was out of business and was put to some difficulties, that if I could lie without sheets I might make use of them till I could get into business.
Smith. The pot was in the room when I let it her, I never gave her leave to pawn them. I could have lent her five shillings or a guinea if I had thought proper, without lending her things to pawn. 

               Guilty

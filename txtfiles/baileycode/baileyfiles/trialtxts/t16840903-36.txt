             confessed the Fact; but Butler being Tryed, it appear'd that Mrs. Welsh keeps a Publick House
, and both the said Parties coming in to drink, she served them in a Silver Tankard; and being put into a Room where the Money aforesaid lay in a Cup board, upon Mrs. Welshes turning her Back, they got the same thence. After which, they paid their Reckoning and desired the Woman to take care of her Tankard, who look'd upon them as very honest Guest, till she see that they had taken care of her Money, and conveyed the same away. Upon full Evidence they were found 

               guilty
             of Felony.

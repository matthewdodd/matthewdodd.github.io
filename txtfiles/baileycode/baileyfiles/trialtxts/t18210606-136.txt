            . I am a watchman of Vincent-square. About five in the morning, I was coming off my beat, and saw the prisoner and another in a gateway; they appeared watching me; I went round into Little George-street, and met them, and asked the prisoner what he had under his jacket, they immediately ran in different directions, I followed, and took the prisoner without losing sight of him; he dropped this brass cock and lenden pipe; I picked it up and compared it with the rest of the pipe - it matched.

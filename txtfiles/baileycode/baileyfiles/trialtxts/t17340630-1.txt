            . I keep a Barber's-Shop on London-Bridge


. The Wig was

                  Bright 
               



            's, I sold it him for 5 l. sometime ago.

            . About 12 on Saturday Night, having just let a Customer out, I was going to sweep the Shop, and my Back being turn'd, I thought I heard some Body behind me, upon which I look'd, but seeing no Body in the Shop, I ran to the Door, and took the Prisoner, with the Wig-box in his Hand, but the Wig was taken out. I know the Wig was in it a few Minutes before, for I put it in myself, and set it on the Shelf; and I knew the Box, because I myself had writ Mr. Bright's Name on it. The Prisoner said, he found the Box at the Door.

            , alias Cock-my-Chin. The Prisoners and I, had been a stealing Oil that Night, at the Old-Swan. We got two Kettles full, and sold it to 
               
                  John 
                  Gill 
               



            , a Hempdresser, in Bridewell-Alley, and then going over London-Bridge, we saw Mr. Dun's Shop open. Stay, says 
               
                  Jack 
                  Jones 
               



            , I'll go and get something. So we staid at the Door, and he went in, and brought out a Wig in a Box; I took the Wig, and put it into my Bosom, and the Man came out, and seiz'd Jack. His Mother seeing this, bid me follow her to Plumb-pudding-Square on London-Bridge. So she ran away, and I ran after her to Plumb-pudding-Square, and gave her the Wig. She ask'd me to go home with her, but I refus'd, and went and took up my Lodging on the Pipes, that belong to the Water-house at the Bridge. The Watch found me there, and carry'd me to the Constable, he threaten'd to send me to Bridewell for a Black-guard; but I promis'd never to lie there any more, and so he let me go. On Sunday Morning I heard, that Jack was in the Poultry-Compter, I borrow'd 6 d. of the Hempman, and went to Jack, and gave him, 2 d. - On Tuesday I went to Lingard's Gin-shop in the Mint, where the Wig was pawn'd for 17 s. I ask'd for some Money, but Mrs. Lingard kick'd me out of Doors. Then I met 
               
                  Jack 
                  Baldwin 
               



            , and another Black-Shoe-Boy, eating a Marrow-bone, I ask'd them to give me a bit, for I was very hungry; but they said, there was 2 Guineas bid for taking me up, and so they got a Constable and took me.

            . I was not with them that Saturday Night, for having been hard at Work all Day, I went home to Bed. And next Morning, as I was cleaning Shoes, I saw the Evidence, and ask'd him where my Son was? He damn'd me for a Bitch, and said, my Son had stole his Blacking-pot - A Porter afterwards told me, my Son was in the Compter.


                  John 
                  Jones 
               



            . I own I was with the Evidence at the Old-Swan, but left him there, and went with the Kettle of Stuff to the Hempman's, and when I came back, I found the Wig-box at the Barber's Door - Yesterday a Woman brought me 2 d. for some Victuals, and said, she saw the Evidence, and that he had told her, he swore against my Mother only because she abus'd him on Sunday -
Cock-my-Chin. It was you that draw'd me away when I liv'd at Mrs. Bradley's, in Pudding-Lane, where I had a Shilling a Week for cleaning Shoes - I know all the Butchers in East-cheap, and they can give me a Character.

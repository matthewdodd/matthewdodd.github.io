 was indicted

JOHN TAYLOR
. I am a mariner, and live in New-street', Deptford. On the 16th of November I went into the Eight Bells at Greenwich, with

some shipmates, a little after ten o'clock—the prisoner came in in about half an hour, and after some time I asked her to drink—she followed me when I went out, and I took her to a house and had a pot of beer—we were there about three quarters of an hour—I walked with her afterwards, and went to a room with her in Rose-street—a woman came out of the house there, and drove us away, and then the prisoner caught hold of the ribbon of my watch, hustled it out, and ran away—I ran after her, but could not see her—I went back to the house with a policeman and found her—she took the watch out of her bosom and dropped it down at her feet—the policeman took her in charge—I am sure she took it from my fob.

Prisoner. The watch fell while * * * * * Witness. It is not true—nothing of the sort took place—the watch was never out of my fob till she took it.





JOSEPH HOLLOWAY
 (police-constable R 197.) The prosecutor told me of his loss—I went with him to a house which he pointed out, and found the prisoner there—he said, "That is the one who stole my watch"—she said, "No, I never stole your watch, and I know nothing about it"—at the same time she put her hand into her bosom and took something from it—I made towards her, and she dropped the watch on the floor—I said, "You must go with me"—she said, "No, you have got what you want, you have nothing more to do with me—I have nothing more of his."
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. It is my first offence.

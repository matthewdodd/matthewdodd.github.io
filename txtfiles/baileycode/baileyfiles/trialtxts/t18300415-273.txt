GEORGE GAIRDNER. I am an upholsterer

. This tea-chest was standing on a chest of drawers in my shop, on Saturday, the 10th of April - it was safe at nine o'clock in the morning when I left.

            . I saw the prisoner near the shop; he went and sat on a sofa in front of the shop; he put his hand into the shop, took the tea-chest, put it under his jacket, and went off - I ran across; there was another man with the prisoner - I could not hear what they said; the other beckoned the prisoner and they turned down Howland-street - I did not lose sight of the prisoner.

            . I saw the prisoner take the chest from the shop - he sat on the sofa, put his hand back, and took it; I followed and took him with it in his possession; he ran down Howland-street.

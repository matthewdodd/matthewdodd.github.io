HENRY LONG
. I live in King-street, St. Giles's, and am a cheesemonger. I sell pork—I saw this pork safe about six o'clock on the 11th of January—I was sitting in my parlour, and saw the prisoner come in and take it out of the window—I ran after him, and to avoid me he threw the pork into a cellar—I took him—this is the piece of pork—it is mine.

Prisoner. I was coming up St. Andrew's-street, and this man came and said he saw me steal some pork—that is all I know of it.




GUILTY
*—Aged 13. 


Transported for Seven Years.

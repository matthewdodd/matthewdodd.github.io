            . I am a servant
 in the stables at Lord Kildare's. The prisoner was a servant
 out of place. We put him to assist in the stables; he had access to my room; the things were kept by me in a chamber where I lay. About seven weeks ago I missed them out of my box: I had seen them about five or six days before. I suspected the prisoner; he was gone away two or three days before I missed them to another stable. I went in search of him, and found him at a stable in Bond street. We found all the things mentioned in the indictment upon him, except the shoe buckles. I saw him throw the shoe buckles under the manger.
John Creek. I am a constable; I was with the prosecutor when he found the things upon the prisoner. Before we searched him he denied having the things.

I found these things in the stable. I put them in my pocket and forgot to take them out again.

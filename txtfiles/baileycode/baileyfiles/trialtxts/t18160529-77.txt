            . I lost this watch on the 16th of April, at about half past two o'clock in the day, in Threadneedle-street


. The prisoner asked me what o'clock it was; and I pulled the watch out of my pocket to tell him, and he nipped it out of my hand, and ran off; and I saw him no more until he was apprehended. We never found the watch again.

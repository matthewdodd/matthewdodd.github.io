199. 




JOHN CASEY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
28th of November, 4 1/2 lbs, weight of gun metal, the goods of 



Edmund Pontifex and another, his masters.






JOHN SHARPE
. I am in the employ of Edmund Pontifex and another, coppersmiths, Shoe-lane, Holborn. We have missed metal lately—the prisoner was a working apprentice there—in consequence of suspicion we watched, but could not discover anything till Mr. Mitchell brought in about 50lbs. weight of our own metal to sell—our foreman looked at some metal in the shop, and when the men were gone five pieces of it were missing—the next morning we saw Mitchell's man come for the money—we sent for an officer, and found the pieces that were missing there—these now produced are them.





WILLIAM PADDEN
. I am in the service of Mr. Mitchell. The prisoner brought these pieces of metal, and sold them to me, last Monday night. 


GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

NANCY SNELL
. I am the wife of Thomas Snell, and live in Gwyns'-place, Lisson-grove—I am a laundress. On the 25th of Dec. I gave my husband a basket of linen, containing the articles stated, to put into the cart—I had examined them—they were the property of the persons I wash for.





THOMAS SNELL
. I put the basket into my cart, which was at the top of Gwyns'-place—I went to my house for some more things, and when I came back I missed the basket.





JOHN CROMEY
. I saw the prisoner take the basket out of the cart—I followed him to Exeter-street and told the officer, who stopped him—he had got rid of the basket while I was looking for an officer—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who took it.


Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. Standing at the shop on the same side as the cart was.

Prisoner's Defence. I was with a young man, coming up the street; I know nothing of it.





WILLIAM THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant D 4.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

CHARLES STUART. I am captain of a vessel
. On the morning of the 25th of March I thought I heard some one in my cabin; I looked up, and saw no one - I then heard the table move: I said, "Who is in my cabin?" I called my mate, who was feeling about, and put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, he was behind my cabin stove - the property stated had been taken from my cabin into the after-cabin; this purse had been in my waistcoat pocket, and I found it at his feet - he was secured.

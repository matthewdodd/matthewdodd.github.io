WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am an ironmonger
, and live in Bond-street. On the 4th of July, about five in the afternoon, I was in St. James's-street


; there was a great crowd,it was the chairing of Sir Samuel Romilly. I found a great pressure against me, and felt my watch go from me, I turned round and saw the prisoner pass it from his left to his right hand. I collared him, and accused him with having my watch. He immediately put it into his right hand and dropped it, it was immediately picked up. Pace had collared him.

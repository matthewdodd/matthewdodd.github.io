. I was in my parlour; on February 25th I saw the prisoner walk softly into my shop, and take three blankets off from a table that stood in the middle of the shop, and then walk softly out again. I immediately pursued him; I saw him before he had got past the next house; he dropped two of the blankets then, and another when he got a little further, and ran away; I pursued him, and cried Stop thief! some people took him.

Prisoner's Defence.
I am errand boy to a copper plate printer: I was going on an errand for my master. I went to a necessary to do my needs; some people came and pulled me up, and insisted upon my going with them; they would not let me button up my breeches; I know nothing of the blankets.

            . I am a linen-draper
, and live at Aldgate


. On the 26th of October, as I came home about a quarter before five o'clock, I met the prisoner about a rood from my door, with one of the prints in his arm, and dragging the other behind him, running in the middle of the road - a waggon was passing between us; I stepped towards him, and then he let it fall out, a cry of Stop thief! was rose, and he was secured - on going into the shop, I missed the cotton from about a yard inside the door; I picked it up myself.

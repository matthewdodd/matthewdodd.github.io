            . On the 28th of April I was in Mr. Rotherham's shop, in Shoreditch


, buying a piece of ribbon - I put my hand into my pocket, and found there was another hand in my pocket, which was taken out closed, and it gave something to the prisoner, who took it, and put it into his pocket - I found I had lost five shillings, one sixpence, and four penny-pieces - I told the prisoner he had got my money - he denied it, and ran off: I followed him, and took hold of him before he got out - I held him till he was taken by the officer; I saw him searched, and some money was taken from him.

             (Police-constable H 68). I took the prisoner, and found five shillings, one sixpence, and 4d. in his right-hand trousers pocket.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that a boy, who was a stranger to him, and had left the shop, thrust the money into his hand, which he offered the prosecutrix on her accusing him of having it.

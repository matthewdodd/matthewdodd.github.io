                  Weatherby 
               



            . Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Crouther 
               



             and I are partners. We have a glass and pot warehouse

 in St. Catharine's


. About a month ago my servant informed me, that the shop had been broke open. I ordered the shop to be made as fast as they could; after which it was broke again. On the 3d of this instant, the prisoner was taken with a basket of goods, the same as mentioned in the indictment. The next witness, my servant, can give a better account than I can.


                  Thomas 
                  Blackbourn 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Weatherby. I have seen the prisoner about our neighbourhood for some time. On the 3d of this instant, about a quarter before six, he was taken about six yards from our shop with a basket on his back, with the goods mentioned, in it. [ Produced in Court.] They are my master's property.


                  Richard 
                  Hart 
               



            . I stopped the prisoner with the basket and goods here produced, upon Mr. Wheeler's wharf, just by the prosecutor's warehouse or shop. When I took him by the collar, he gave me to understand, in broken English, that the goods were his own.
Q. What did he say?
Hart. I said, what have you got here? He said, Me, me, me, min on goods, min on goods, min on goods. I call'd 
               
                  William 
                  Welch 
               



            , he came with a light, and we secured the prisoner. These are the goods he had upon him, that are here produced.


                  William 
                  Welch 
               



            . 
               
                  Richard 
                  Hart 
               



             held the prisoner, and I took this basket of goods from his shoulder. Then we called some of Mr. Weatherby's men, and secured him.


                  Samuel 
                  Hudson 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Weatherby, and Co. I know the goods, here produced, to be their property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I brought those goods along with me from Holland. The ship and crew are return'd, so I have no witnesses.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the shop
            .

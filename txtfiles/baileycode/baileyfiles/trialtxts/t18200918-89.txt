                  TAYLOR
               



            . I am parish-clerk of St. Martin in the Fields. I produce the register, by which I find, that on the 10th of September, 1819, 
               
                  Patrick 
                  Cannon
               



             was married by banns, to 
               
                  
                     Sarah 
                     Davis
                  



               
             - his mark is put to it, and it is witnessed by 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Curry
               



             and myself.


                  MARY 
                  CURRY
               



            . I had a daughter named Eliza, she is now deceased. The signature to the register is her writing. I knew the prisoner well - he was then a neighbour of mine. I was intimate with 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Davis
               



             - I sent them the fruit for their wedding dinner. I know my daughter left my house to accompany them to church - after that Davis went by the name of Mrs. Cannon. They lived together as husband and wife, and he always called her his wife from that day. I saw her last week, she was then alive.
Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q, Where do you live - A. In Whitcombe-street; I then lived in Bluecross-street. I am a grocer - I have lived in that neighbourhood thirteen years - my daughter dined with them.


                  THOMAS 
                  CURRY
               



            . I am brother to 
               
                  Eliza 
                  Curry
               



            . The hand-writing to the register is hers. I know the prisoner and Davis lived together as man and wife till within the last five months. The prisoner used to call her Mrs. Cannon.
- DAVIS. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Davis
               



             is my daughter. I never heard of her being married to the prisoner - I was told she was. She went by the name of Cannon.


                     ANN 
                     CLARK
                  



               
            . I first became acquainted with the prisoner three years ago; he courted me two years, and told me he was single. I was married to him at Christ church Newgate-street


, on the 25th of July, 1818, by the name of 
               
                  James 
                  Cannon
               



            . I had saved about 8 l. in service, and had 50 l. left me. He lived four months with me - spent all my money, and left me pregnant by him. I then lived on Saffron-hill - my child is now dead. When he left me I was obliged to get relief from the parish.

            . I am an officer of St. Andrew's parish. Clark complained of the prisoner deserting her, for which I apprehended him in Drury-lane; he was imprisoned in Clerkenwell. I afterwards found he had been married before. I produce a copy of the register at Christ church, - (read.).

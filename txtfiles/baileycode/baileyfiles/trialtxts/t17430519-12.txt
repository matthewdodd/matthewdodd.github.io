            . I am a Linnen-Draper
 in Bridges street, Covent-Garden


, this is my Goods, I took it from under the Prisoner's Apron in the Street.


                  William 
                  Appleby 
               



            . As I was standing at my Master's Door, ( Mr Tingey , a Carpenter) I saw the Prisoner take something off Mr. Conran's Counter: I went to him, and asked him whether he had lost any thing; Mr. Conran said he missed a piece of Cloth, he followed the Prisoner, and took this piece from her in the Street.


                  William 
                  Conran 
               



            . There was another Woman with her, and she asked for some Check for Aprons; and immediately Apple by came to me and informed me of this, and said he would show me where it is. No, said the other, stay and show me some Check. No, said I, I will not stay. So I left my Wife in the Shop, and went after the Prisoner and took her; they both of them asked for Check, and neither of them had a Farthing of Money in their Pockets. I have another Indictment of the same Nature; we are pester'd with these Creatures.

            . I am a shipwright
, and live at Shadwell


; I also keep a chandler's shop
. The pr isoner came into my shop and took a sugar-loaf out of it the 16th of December, about four or five in the afternoon. I went to the door and stopped him; there was nobody in the shop when he came in; he asked me to let him go. I stood in a passage not far from the shop door, and watched him. I lost two sugarloave on the 15th of December.

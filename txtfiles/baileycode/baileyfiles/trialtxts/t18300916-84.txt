JOHN FOORD. I am a carpenter
. On the evening of Saturday, the 15th of August, I was in Henry-street, Hampstead-road


 - the prisoner accosted me, and wished me to go with her; I gave her a slight push, and found her hand in my right-hand pocket, dragging something out - I missed 5s. from that pocket; I gave an alarm - a man came up, and the Policeman took her.

            . I was going up the street, and saw the prisoner seize the prosecutor by the right arm, and dash her hand into his pocket - she drew it out, and he sang out that he was robbed of 5s.; she ran across - I stopped her and said, "Here is the Policeman coming" - I held her till he came up.

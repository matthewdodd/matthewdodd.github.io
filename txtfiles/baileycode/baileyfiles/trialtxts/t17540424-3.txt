            . I live near Cavendish-square


, and am a mason
; on the 15th of Feb. in the morning I lost some lead off my coach-house and stable; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Webb 
               



             the watchman had stopped the prisoner with the lead; I compared it with the place it was taken from, and it fitted.
Webb deposed to that of stopping the prisoner, and comparing it with the place from whence it was taken.
The prisoner in his defence said, when the watchman asked him what he had there, he said, he did not know, it was given him.



               Guilty

MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You never saw the prisoner in the house? A. No—I did not see him till he was at the Police-office.

JOHN SPITTLE (City policeman, 671). On 19th July I was passing along Portman-square—I saw the prisoner come out of Lower Berkley-street—he was running, and holding up his right-hand pocket, which had something in it which rattled like silver—he stood, and looked about, and returned to Lower Berkley-street again—I took him, and found on him these spoons, and other things, which have been identified by the butler.

Cross-examined. Q. How far was the prisoner from Montague-square? A. About 200 yards.

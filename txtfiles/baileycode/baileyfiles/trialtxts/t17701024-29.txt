            . I met the prisoner last Sunday was fortnight, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. I was much in liquor; She wanted me to go with her to her lodgings in Prince's-street; I refused to go with her, and proposed for us to go to my own lodgings. She went with me to my lodging. We went to bed together a little after twelve o'clock; about one o'clock a watchman found the door open, and alarmed us, and then I found the prisoner was gone, and I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment; they were the clothes I had on when she picked me up.
Q. What business are you?
Salter. I am a journeyman hair-dresser

            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's lodgings; I found all the things upon the tester of her bed (The goods produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) When she was charged with the robbery, she acknowledged it, and fell upon her knees and begged for mercy.
Prisoner's Defence.
The prosecutor picked me up, and as he was dressed so rich, I agreed to go home with him to his lodgings. He agreed to give me a guinea, and he had no money in his pocket; I took his things to pawn for the guinea.

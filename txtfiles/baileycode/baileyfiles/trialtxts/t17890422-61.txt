             sworn.
On Monday morning I found a coat button on the lighter-head, the constable has it, I kept it till my father (the last witness) came home; the step-board belonging to the wherry was in the lighter's fore sheets, which was belonging to the boat that they had stolen away; I suspected the prisoner by the button, we found them in East Smithfield on Tuesday morning the 31st; they were taken in East Smithfield; they ran away when they saw us, we did not find any of the things; they were overtaken, they acknowledged taking the things in a public-house.

             sworn.
My master sent me to look after the chain, I was walking down towards Ratcliffe Highway, and just before I came to the door I saw Evans and one Beck together; then I stept back, he is an accomplice, I said, I believe I want you; then afterwards I let him go; he ran away and I ran after him, and took him again; I sent my master's son away immediately to fetch his father; he brought him to Battle Bridge; then we went to the public-house, and I heard Evans say, he was the person that lent a hand to rob the lighter, on the 31st of March, before Justice Swabey; I cannot say whether it was taken in writing or not, I was present when he was examined.
Prosecutor. I was present, there was no promise made to Evans or Scott to tell the truth; I heard what he said.
Kitchenor. Evans said he lent a hand to haul the chain out, and put it into another boat; Scott said he was not guilty.
Prosecutor. I heard Evans say that he lent a hand to haul the chain up out of the lighter-head, and to put it into the wherry, and that they sold it at Limehouse for half a guinea; we were going out to search, and before I went out they sent me word they had taken a man; the button which was found and given to me is one of the accomplice's that was admitted an evidence; his 3d and 5th buttons are off his coat; Evans got from them, at that time they did not secure either of them but Beck; Evans got off.
- BECK sworn.
Court. I shall not hear Beck's evidence against Scott.
To Beck. You was concerned in this robbery? - Yes.
Was Evans with you? - Yes.
Are you sure of that? - Yes.
What time did you go on board the lighter? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock.
How many were there of you? - Four of us; we took a piece of chain, and two or three pieces of rope; we got a piece of stick and broke the hold board up, and got a chain; we carried the things to Limehouse; there we sold them for half a guinea for the chain, and half a hundred of rope and other things for twelve shillings and nine pence; they gave us twenty-three shillings and six-pence for it all and two tarpaulins.
PRISONER EVANS's DEFENCE.
Scott had nothing to do in the affair; Beck persuaded me to go out with him, I being a little in liquor went out with him, little thinking any thing of that kind, and he hauled the chain up.

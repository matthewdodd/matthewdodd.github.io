FRANCIS WALKER
. I am the wife of Henry Walker, a weaver, of Cam-den-street. I hired the prisoner on the 18th of April—I sent her out at night for some oil, and gave her half-a-crown—she Went away on the Fri-day—I went to her mother's, and she opened the door to me her-self—I said, "You are here"—she said, "I am here"—I said, "How came you to take the half-crown from me?"—she said she did not know—I said, "You were aware I could not afford to lose it"—she said she did not know—I said she was aware I could give her in charge—she said I might if I could, but she understood the law—I then gave her in charge.





DENNIS POWER

                  Joseph 
                  William Smith
               



            . On the 9th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner in my front room, with the watch in his hand. I asked him for it, he resisted, and would not give it to me. I laid hold of him; he pulled me out of the street-door, and knocked me down. I got up, and pursued, calling Stop thief! he was stopped a quarter of a mile off with it in his hand. I never lost sight of him.

            . I heard the alarm, and stopped the prisoner, who was running. He said,
"Don't stop me, it is not me." I found the watch in his hand.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

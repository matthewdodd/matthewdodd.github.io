            . I am servant to Mr. Wm. Hobson, who lives in Windsor-place, City-road


. On the 14th of July the prisoner came into the kitchen; he went out in about eight minutes, and I immediately missed seven spoons, which were safe about five minutes before. I had been out of the kitchen while he was there - I knew him before; master had employed him to scour some empty houses down; we could not find him till the Monday following, when he was taken.

            . I am an errand-boy to Mr. Hobson. I heard of this loss, and met the prisoner on the Thursday following. I asked what he had done with the spoons; he said they were sold and melted down, and they could not have them any more. I said Mr. Hobson would have him taken - he said he did not care; he could not give him more than six weeks, for he did not break any locks.

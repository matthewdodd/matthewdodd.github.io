. I accompanied the constable on the 15th of October to the prisoner's lodgings the Eagle and Child, St. Martin's-lane. I found this cloth there. The prisoner was in his room when the officer and I went there. The prisoner said it was his room. On our entering the room I told him I was come to see if there was any property there belonging to Mr. Maberley. His key was in his box. The first thing that struck my sight in his box was a piece of blue cloth with the broad arrow and S G. I found in his room six pieces of cloth in the whole. It is worth five shillings and ten pence a yard It is Mr. Maberley's property.

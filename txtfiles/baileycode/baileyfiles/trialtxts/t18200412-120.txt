            . I live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square, and am a corn and nail operator
. On the 7th of April, I was in the Strand


, about eight o'clock, and met the prisoner near St. Martin's-lane. He made a snatch at my watch-chain - the chain gave way, and two rings went with the seal; he ran off. I pursued him, calling Stop thief! he cried out also, and ran through the courts towards Chandos-street; I was close behind him, but not near enough to lay hold of him. He was met by Greve, who stopped him. I found my key on the ground, but not the seal.

            . I heard the cry, and stopped the prisoner, who was also crying Stop thief! - we both fell together; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him. I took him to Bow-street, and picked up the key.

            . I am headborough
 of Shoreditch. I lost my handkerchief while I was on duty at Bow-fair


. I was looking at one of the shows, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and I felt something at my pocket; it did not strike me at first that my pocket was picked; but in a moment or two afterwards, I searched the pocket, and found the handkerchief was gone. I saw the prisoner making off in a direction from me, and I thought it right to secure him. I searched him, and found the handkerchief in his bosom.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up, and had not had it in my hand two minutes.

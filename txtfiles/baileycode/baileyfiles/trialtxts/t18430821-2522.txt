ELIZABETH ARNOLD
. I am the wife of Henry Phillips Arnold. On the 29th of July I sent a basket, containing two petticoats, three gowns, and two shifts, by my little boy, to Lamb's Conduit-street—he brought the basket back without the linen—I have not found the things.





WILLIAM ARNOLD
. On the 29th of July my mother sent me with a basket of clothes—as I was going along the prisoner stopped me, and said she was left in care of the house, and I was to leave them with her—in consequence of that I went into a house, and left them there—I am quite sure she is the woman.

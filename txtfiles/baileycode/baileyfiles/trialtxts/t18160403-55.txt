            . I lost this cotton between four and five in the afternoon of the 9th of February; I have frequently seen the prisoner about the shop. This cotton was hung on an iron bar just within side the door. A man of the name of Wilson was tried here for this offence, and sentenced to be Transported for Seven Years.
THOMAS THOMPSON. I am a patrole of the parish of St. Sepulchre. About half past three in the afternoon of the 9th of February, I was in St. John-street; I saw the two prisoners in company with one Wilson, who has been convicted at the last Sessions. Knowing them, I followed them into Holborn; all the way they were loitering about different shops. When they came to the prosecutor's shop, Smith crossed over the way opposite; Walker and Wilson went to the shop, and in a moment Wilson came running away with a piece of printed cotten in his apron; he crossed over to the end of Brownlow-street, and there I caught hold of him; I took him back to Mr. Houlbrooke, who indentified the property. They were all three in company together.

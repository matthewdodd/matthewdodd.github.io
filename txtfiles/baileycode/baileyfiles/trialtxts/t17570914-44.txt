            . I live in St. Giles's


, my husband's name is Thomas, he is a house painter
. The prisoner came to lodge with me. She came in the name of Hetty Pen. She told me she had brought her husband up to St. Thomas's Hospital, who was a shoemaker, to be cut for a fistula; but now I understand she has no husband. She continued with me three weeks. My husband was call'd to go out of town about business, and I let her lie with me for company for near a week. On the 4th of August I was washing. I went out to buy a bit of something for dinner, and when I returned she told me there had been a gentlewoman, an acquaintance of mine, had sent her maid for me. As I was going out the prisoner said, Mrs. Dawson, where are you going, you had better leave your rings at home, you may drop them off your finger. I said there is no danger of losing them. When I return'd it was near ten o'clock at night. I found the candle (lighted) close down by the drawers where my things were taken from, and my baby in the cradle close by it. I found the outward door shut to, but the prisoner was gone. I had left her in the house to take care of it. I missed eleven guineas, two half guineas, and 28 s. in silver out of the drawer. I look'd about and missed all the things mention'd in the indictment. I got up in the morning and went to a man that used to visit her at my house. He is an ostler at the Maiden-Head at Edgware, who she used to say was her brother; he directed me where to find her. Then I came home and went to justice Welch, and told him the case, and that I was inform'd she was bred at Aylesbury. He said Mr. Woodcock the gaoler there was his brother, and he'd give me a letter to him, who would endeavour to assist me in finding her.
Q. from prisoner. Whether there was not a strange man lay along with you that night, and you was rob'd by him?
M. Dawson. No, there was not upon my oath.


                  John 
                  Woodcock 
               



            . I received a letter from Mr. Welch concerning the prisoner. I made inquiry, and found her at Missington; that was her habitation. When I took her she gave me these things. (Producing two caps, a handkerchief and an apron ) I ask'd her how she came by them, she said she believ'd they were Mrs. Dawson's.
Mrs. Dawson. These things produced here are mine, and were lost that night.
Woodcock. I brought her to Aylesbury, and confined her; this day sev'n night I brought her to London. I told the prisoner there were eleven guineas and two half guineas taken from the woman; she said she knew nothing of that.
Mrs. Dawson. She confessed she took only 8 s. I went where she said she had sold the cotton gown, in Cock-Lane, for 10 s. and where she said she had sold my child's ear-rings, to a woman in Holbourn, and she went with me; we demanded them, but I never got any thing again but these things that Mr. Woodcock has produced.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all of these things. She keeps a very bad house. That very night a man lay in the room with her all night; the house is free for all comers and goers. The things here produced were given to me. I make lace, and work very hard for my living. Mr. Woodcock will give me a character. I come from Buckinghamshire.
Q. to Mr. Woodcock. How long have you known her?
Woodcock. I have known her from a child. Her father and mother were very honest people. Her father liv'd servant in my family some years, and till now I never heard any thing ill of the girl. I believe, had it been near her friends, she would have many witnesses to give her a character.
Q. Did she seem to be full of money?
Woodcock. No, she seem'd to be in a deplorable condition, and had no stockings to her feet; these things here produc'd she had pawn'd for 2 s. and I fetch'd them out for her.
Q. When did you find her?
Woodcock. On the 22d of August.
John Banbury. The prosecutrix owed me some money, I sent after her for it; one day in particular I went to her, and ask'd her for it; then she said she had been rob'd.
Q. What did she owe you?
Banbury. She ow'd me 13 s.
Q. What are you?
Banbury. I am a taylor. I ask'd her who rob'd her, she said the prisoner at the bar.
Q. Did you know the prisoner ?
Banbury. I did, I had seen her there, and they were very intimate. I ask'd what she was rob'd of; several things she said, and 8 s. which 8 s. she said she had saved for me. I reply'd to her, you suffer yourself to be rob'd rather than pay an honest debt. She asked me at the same time to write a letter to her brother that was at the camp, and to set forth the case and circumstance she was in, as to being rob'd; she never mention'd more than 8 s. in money.
Q. Is she a married woman?
Banbury. She is. Her husband is a painter, and was pressed on board a man of war, on an information, and Mr. Welch, upon an affidavit, had him discharged. The man is a very honest man; he was serv'd with four copies of writs, and I lent him ten shillings of the money out of my pocket, part of this that is owing, to make it up.
Q. to prosecutrix. You hear what this man says, is it true?
Prosecutrix. I never owed him a farthing in my life. I know no more of what he says than the child unborn; upon my oath it is all false. He came to me upon this occasion, and told me he could plead in any court in England.
Q. Did you ever tell this man you had saved 8 s. for him?
Prosecutrix. No, never.
Q. Did you ever desire him to write a letter for you to your brother?
Prosecutrix. No, I never did.
Q. Have you a brother at camp?
Prosecutrix. No; he has been abroad these two years. We have heard he was killed.
Q. Have you not another brother?
Prosecutrix . I had, but he has been dead these two years.




               Guilty, 13 s
            .
The jury and bench declaring they did not believe one word that Banbury swore, he was committed.

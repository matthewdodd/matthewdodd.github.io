            . I keep a china shop
 in Oxford-street; my coat was in a basket, in a cart, which stood at a china shop in Compton-street


. I stood in the shop, a man stood at the doorway, blocking it up - a lady said she did not like him; I turned round, and saw the prisoner on the wheel of the cart - I saw him take the coat out of the basket; I tried to get out, but the man at the door tried to prevent me, I pushed him away, ran after the prisoner, he dropped the coat, and was stopped about thirty yards from the cart. I picked it up, and am sure he is the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. He cannot swear I was the person.

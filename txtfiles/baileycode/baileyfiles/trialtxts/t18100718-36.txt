                  BURNHAM SHAW
               



            . I am in the lace and wine trade. I live at 36, St. Paul's Church-yard


; the prisoner was my porter
. With regard to the lace, I do not know when I lost it. I saw him take the bottles out of the cellar on the 22nd of June. I sent him to the cellar to take six bottles of wine, to be delivered in Tavistock-street; instead of six he took twelve. Mr. Gardener was watching him.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BROOKS GARDENER
               



            . I live upon my fortune. I keep the house that Mr. Shaw lives in. I saw the prisoner come out of the cellar with more bottles in the basket than six; he put the basket on his shoulder, I followed him. After he had taken the wine from the cellar, he should have returned the key. He had about fifty yards to go before he turned up the Old Change. When I turned up the corner of the Old Change I missed him all at once. I was sure that he had gone into some house, or had stopped somewhere; he could not have got out of my sight without turning into some house. I then went to Mr. Shaw to see if he had been home with the key. I found that he had not. I left the house, and looked about the neighbourhood of Doctor's Commonsto see if I could find him. I returned back again, and found he had left the keys. I knew previous that he was to take six bottles of wine to Tavistock-street. I went to the house in Tavistock-street, and found that he had not been there. In a few minutes I saw the prisoner with a little boy; he was facing the house; he turned up Tavistock-court; he had two baskets with him. I saw him put one basket down containing six bottles of wine, which is the subject of this enquiry, and he seemed to give the charge of the basket to a little boy. He then went to Tavistock-street to the house that had ordered the six bottles of wine, with six bottles, and left them there. I crossed over into the court, and took the little boy with the basket of six bottles into the public-house. I told the landlord of the house to take care of the boy and the basket. I went to Bow-street and got an officer. We secured the prisoner facing of the court, took him, the wine, and the boy to Bow-street. We afterwards searched his lodgings, No. 3, Stansbury-court, Piccadilly; the lace was found there by the officer and Mr. Shaw.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street On the 22nd of June I apprehended the prisoner in Covent Garden. I searched his lodgings; I found two pieces of lace and five duplicates. I produce the handbasket with the wine.

Q. to Prosecutor. Do you know any thing of the wine or bottles - A. I cannot swear to either; the two pieces of lace that was found in his lodging I can swear to; I believe they are all mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime; I lived with a woman that was in the habit of buying and selling lace; I never bought or sold any myself.

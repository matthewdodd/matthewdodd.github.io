            . I am a constable. On the 5th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, as the people came out of the English Opera-house


, I saw the prisoner, in company with another, try several gentlemen's pockets; they followed two gentlemen; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from one of their pockets, and put his hand behind to give it to the other; I seized him and took it from his hand; a scuffle ensued but I kept him; the gentleman came to the watch-house, but I do not know where he is, or his name, or where he lives; he is an officer, and was going to France.

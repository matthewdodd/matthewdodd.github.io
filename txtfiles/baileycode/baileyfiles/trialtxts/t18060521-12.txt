Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of receiving orders for Mr. Harrison, whatever order I received from Miss Clift, or any other person's order, I entered down in my book; during the time I was at Mr. Thresher's, Mr. Harrison came after me, he wished to get me away, he knew I had a good connection, and during the time I was in his house he never went round to one customer, I have even given him the money in public company, he has been the person that has introduced me into company, (for singing) which has been my ruin.

JAMES BIRD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of September, at 

St. Luke, 1 clock, value 5l. 5s. the goods of 



James Peachey, in his dwelling-house.






JOHN MOORE
. I am assistant to James Peachey, of Goswell-street—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Luke. I was behind the counter at a quarter to seven o'clock on the evening of the 27th of September—my attention was drawn towards the door—I saw the prisoner leave the shop with the clock in his arms—it had been inside the front the shop—I ran out and overtook him—he said it was given into his arms by a man in front of the shop—he was walking very leisurely—the clock was worth five guineas—we might have taken 4l. 19s. for it.





WILLIAM TAYLOR
. On the 27th of September I saw the prisoner and another at the top of Old-street, Goswell-street, very near Mr. Peachey's—I watched them—there was an accident with a horse and gig—his companion attempted to pick a gentleman's pocket, but did not succeed—they went to Mr. Peachey's, and the other lifted the clock from the shop

front, and put it in the prisoner's arms—he walked off with it—the other ran away—I had watched them from half-past six o'clock till seven.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Shoreditch. A man asked me to carry it; I was walking on very leisurely behind him; the prosecutor came and asked what I had got; I said, "A clock." I showed him the man that gave it to me. I was in company with no other person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

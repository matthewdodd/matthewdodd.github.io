This Mary Fowler, has for some Time kept a notorious Bawdy House in White Horse Alley, Chick-Lane, at which Place unthinking simple Sots have been frequently ensnared, gull'd, &c. and several of the Strumpets have been brought out of the House to Justice; but the Mother being in a fair Way for a long Voyage, it is hoped the Crew will be dispersed into other Quarters.

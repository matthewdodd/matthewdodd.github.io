            . I live at Birmingham. On the 30th of June, about one o'clock, I was on Holborn-hill


, and felt for my handkerchief, which I had used five minutes before, and it was gone - upon turning round I saw the prisoner near a window, and when he saw me looking at him, he stopped, and dropped my handkerchief - I picked it up, laid hold of him, and charged him with it; he said it was not him; that he had not took it upon his word. I gave him in charge.

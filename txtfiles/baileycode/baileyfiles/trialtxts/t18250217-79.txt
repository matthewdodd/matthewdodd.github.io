WILLIAM DAWSON. I am a stationer
, and live in Cannon-street. On the 15th of February I was going through Mitre-court, Wood-street


, and felt a tug at my coat pocket. I turned round, and saw the prisoner making away from me. I called out, and he began to run - a gentleman stopped him in Wood-street; I collared and charged him with picking my pocket - he opened his coat, and said I might search him. I said "Perhaps you have given it to somebody?" He said he had not. I took him back, and found it in the gutter, close to where I felt the tug. There was nobody near me but him.

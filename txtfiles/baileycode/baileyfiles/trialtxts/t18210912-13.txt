            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Aldersgate-street


. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th of August, the prisoner came in with another woman, and asked to look at some prints. I took them down one by one, they both looked at them, and while I was reaching down a pice, the prisoner turned round. My boy gave me information, I detained her, and sent for an officer. While the boy was gone for him, she entreated me to let her go, and put down about 10 s., I caught a piece of calico, as it fell from under her whittle, - it measured twenty-two yards, and was worth 9 s.,

            . I am servant to Mr. Gregory. The prisoner came in with a woman, and asked to look at some prints, which my master showed her. I saw her turn round, and take a piece of calico, from one of the shelves. I told my master - he detained her. She offered him about 10 s. 6 d., to let her go. Her companion did not leave till after it was stolen.

             CAIGER. These are my trousers - I lost them on the 5th of August, from opposite Goldsmith's floor-cloth manufactory, while I was gone to Billingsgate; they hung on a rail of the bedstead - I had employed the prisoner to sell ginger-beer for me; he left me without notice - he was taken on the 11th of August, with the trousers on him.

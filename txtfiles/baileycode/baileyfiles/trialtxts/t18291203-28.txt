            . I live in Hackney-road


, and am a watchmaker
. On the 18th of November the prisoner came to my shop, about half-past two o'clock, and asked if I had any small pieces of silver to sell - in about twenty minutes I went into the shop, and saw him lying on the counter; he had got my glass-case open, and this watch, which was hanging in the window, was in his hand - I sprung upon him, and secured him with it in his hand; he did not say any thing, but attempted to get away.
JAMES BROWN. I was in Hackney-road, and met the prisoner and the prosecutor; I took charge of the prisoner - he had only 2 1/2 d. on him - I have made inquiries about him, and believe he was in great distress; he has no parents.

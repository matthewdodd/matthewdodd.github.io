            . I am a watchman, and live in Red Lion-alley, Cow-cross. A little after six o'clock in the evening of the 9th of May, I saw the prisoner Burke near the Wheatsheaf public-house - he then went into the house and robbed the prosecutor of his handkerchief; he brought it out and gave it to Carty, who took it and put it into his right-hand pocket - I seized him with it, and another watchman took Burke - this is the handkerchief.

            . I live at the Horse-shoe Wharf, Upper Thames-street. I was at the Wheatsheaf on the 9th of May, and lost this handkerchief.
Burke's Defence. I was coming out of the public-house and saw this handkerchief; Carty picked it up at the step of the door.
Carty's Defence. I was returning from Mr. Willets, where I had been in search of work; I saw the handkerchief on the step and picked it up and put it in my pocket.
Mary Cannon, of Bear-alley, gave the prisoner Carty a good character.

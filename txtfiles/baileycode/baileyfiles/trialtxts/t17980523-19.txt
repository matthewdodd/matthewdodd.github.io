            : On Monday the 14th of May, a little after five o'clock in the afternoon, we were busy loading the waggons, and I saw the prisoner go by with a box, he had it in his hand, I thought he might have come into the yard and fetched it as being his own; I immediately went into the warehouse to our master, and asked him if he delivered in a little box; he said, no, he had not; I then went after him; sir, what are you going to do with that box; he made me no answer, but walked very fast towards the gate-way; I called out stop, stop the man with the box; the Bath coach was just loading and going out, and the Bath horse-keeper stopped him; he had let the box fall.
Q. Are you sure that is the man who had that box in his possession? - A. Yes; I am clear of it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. Head porter in the yard of the Saracen's Head.
Q. You do not know any thing of the proprietors of the Taunton waggon yourself? - A. Yes, and have for many years.
Q. You do not yourself know who are the parties concerned in this waggon? - A. Yes, I do; I am head porter to their waggon.

             sworn. - I am porter to the Taunton coach: I saw the prisoner at the bar pass by me, as I was standing in the yard at the tap-room door, between five and six o'clock; he walked by me a steady pace, with a box under his arm; Mr. Bishop followed after him, and said, what are you going to do with that box; the prisoner made him no answer, but mended his pace; as soon as he got underneath the gateway, by the side of the Bath coach, he began to run, and let the box fall by the Bath horse-keeper; but he was followed, and we took him just without side the gate; we brought him up the yard, and immediately sent for a constable.

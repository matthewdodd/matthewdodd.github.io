            . I am landry-maid to my Lord Anson, the prisoner was employed as a washerwoman
; we missed these things at divers times, and I found them at last at two pawn-brokers, four shirts of my Lord's, two shifts of my Lady's, seven napkins, a handkerchief and neckcloth. The things were produced, and swore to; the pawn-broker's servant swore to the prisoner's bringing them.
The prisoner made no defence.

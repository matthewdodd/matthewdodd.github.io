SAMUEL BREWBR
. I am a clerk in the East India House. I was in Gracechurch-street on Saturday evening, the 4th of September—I felt my handkerchief taken from my pocket—I turned, and found it lying on the ground—the prisoner was near me, but I did not see it in his possession—this now produced is it.





JOSEPH FOSTER
. I saw the prisoner and another following a gentleman, as I thought, to pick his pocket—they missed him—they then saw Mr. Brewer, and one of them (I could not see which) was in the act of picking his pocket—I crossed over, and the prisoner dropped the handkerchief from his jacket—he ran—I pursued and caught him.

Prisoner's Defence. A boy picked the prosecutor's pocket; the prosecutor

turned round, and the boy threw the handkerchief down; the witness took me, and said I was the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 13.—


Transported for Ten Years—Convict Ship.

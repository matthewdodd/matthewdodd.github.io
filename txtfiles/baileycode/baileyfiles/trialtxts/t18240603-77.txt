            . On the 15th of April, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Lower Thames-street


, and felt a twitch at my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner and another passing me, and said,
"You have stolen my handkerchief," (as I missed it;) they both ran away - the prisoner crossed the street; he seemed to be fumbling about his coat. I followed him; he was stopped - I said,
"You villian, you have stolen my handkerchief;" he pulled it from under his coat; gave it to me, and begged my pardon.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up. I have been out of work a long time.

; I did not perceive my handkerchief taken, nor notice the prisoner till a Policeman, who had him in custody, produced it to me - it was safe two minutes before.

            . I am a Policeman. I saw Mr. Robbins on Holborn-hill, with a lady; I saw the prisoner in company with another person, and saw the other draw the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the prisoner, who was close to him - I immediately seized him, and took it from his left hand; he said, "Oh, let me go," and burst into tears; his companion ran away immediately.
JOHN HODGE. I am a constable, serving in my own right. I saw a crowd, and found the prisoner in Powell's custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner handed in a petition for a lenient sentence.

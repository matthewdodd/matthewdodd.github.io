WILLIAM MALYON.
 (City policeman, 456.) On the 6th of Aug., about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Gutter-lane, Cheapside, I saw the prisoner, and asked him where those handkerchiefs were, he made no answer—I pulled his coat open, and saw two handkerchiefs in his breast—I took them out, these are them—they were not found in this paper—the ticket was in his trowsers pocket.





HENRY WALKER.
 I am shopman to George Bean, hosier, of No. 98, Cheapside. I lost some handkerchiefs; and had seen them safe at seven o'clock, which was half-an-hour before—these are them, they are George Bean's, my master's—this is the ticket which was on them—it could not be blown off—they were inside the shop.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in Cheapside.




GUILTY.** Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

             (City-policeman, No. 68). On the night of the 6th of September, I was in Bartholomew-fair


, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of a man's breast pocket; he immediately put it into his own breast pocket - the crowd being so great, I immediately laid hold of him, and could not stop the person he took the handkerchief from; I did not know the person before; I have the handkerchief here; it has no name on it - Hodgson searched him.

             (City-policeman, No, 34). I found a purse and a rattle on the prisoner, but no handkerchief; the person was a gentlemanly looking man; I saw the whole transaction; I expected the gentleman was going to follow us to the Compter, for he saw me take the prisoner; the crowd was so great I could not call his attention to it myself; it was eleven o'clock at night.

A JUROR. We think some blame is attributable to the officers for not bringing the prosecutor forwards.
TIMOTHY FISHER HODGSON. At the time this happened I was stabbed in the thigh, whether by a party connected with him, I don't know - I was laid up for ten days.
JUROR. That alters the case entirely.

             , July the 25th
.
Plumtree. On the 25th of July last, as I was passing by the Royal-Exchange


, I felt a Hand in my Pocket; upon which I turned round, and I saw the Prisoner take the Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and sling it down behind him: I was upon my guard, for some Body else had attempted to pick my Pocket about half a Minute before; I saw him take it out, and I saw the Handkerchief in his Hand; I caught hold of him, and dragged him to the Place where the Handkerchief was dropt, which was about two Yards from the Place where we stood.
The Prisoner said there was another Boy there as well as he.




               Guilty value 10 d.

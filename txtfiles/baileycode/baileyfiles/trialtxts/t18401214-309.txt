ELLEN BAILEY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



John Augustus Macdonald, from his person.






WILLIAM JONES
. I am a waiter at an hotel in Bridges-street, Covent Garden. On the 9th of December I was outside my master's door—I saw the prosecutor—the prisoner took his handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it under her shawl—I told the prosecutor of it—I took it from the prisoner—she said she had no handkerchief—this is it.





JOHN AUGUSTUS MACDONALD
. This is my handkerchief—it had been safe in my pocket—Jones spoke to me, and I missed it—the prisoner had not got far from me—I saw it taken from her left side—she used the most horrid language.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.




GUILTY.* Aged 30.—


Transported for Ten Years.

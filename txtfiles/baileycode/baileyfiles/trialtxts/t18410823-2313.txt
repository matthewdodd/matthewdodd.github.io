CHARLES KNAPP
. I am a salesman, and live in the Edge ware-road. I lost this plated liquor-stand and three decanters two years ago from my shop—the prisoner came to my shop about eighteen months ago, and asked if I had not lost a handsome liquor-stand—I said I had—he told me if I I went to a certain house in a certain street, and went np stain, I should find it on the side-board, but he was in liquor, and I took no notice of it—the officer afterwards told me it was in pledge, and I went to the pawnbrokers, and identified it.





WILLIAM HUMPHREYS
. I found the duplicate of this stand on the prisoner.





WALTER GEORGE NEWSTEAD
. This stand was pawned at my house by a female on the 21st of June last—this is the duplicate given for it.

Prisoner. I know nothing at all about it.

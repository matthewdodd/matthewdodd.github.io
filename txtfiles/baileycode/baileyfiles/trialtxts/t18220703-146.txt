            . I am a painter, and live at Ratcliff-highway. I was at work opposite Crellin's, and saw the prisoner loitering about the window - I watched and saw him take a pair of blue cloth trowsers from the door, wrap them up in his apron, and run into Pell-street. I ran and told Crellin; then followed, but could not see him. He was brought back in a quarter of an hour. I am certain of him. I had seen him loitering about for ten minutes.

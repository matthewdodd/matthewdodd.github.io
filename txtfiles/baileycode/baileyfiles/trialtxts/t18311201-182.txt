            . I am a Police-officer. On the 25th of November, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prosecutor at the corner of Dorset-square - I ran towards Blandford-square, and saw the basket on the pavement; I called the prosecutor - he said it was his; I then ran, and saw the prisoner leaving the pail, and running into Regent's-park - a servant stopped him: he said he was very sorry, but did it for want - he said he knew the prosecutor, and if I would allow him to see him he could make it up.

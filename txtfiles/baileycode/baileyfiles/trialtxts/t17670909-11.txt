            . I live in the Fleet-market



, and deal in corn
; I had notice that a sack of corn was carried to a house in Hat and Tun-yard about the 3d of August; I went according as I was directed, and found it with about half a bushel of oats in it; I had had the sack in my hand but a day or two before in my warehouse; 
               
                  John 
                  Ballard 
               



             was my servant
, he owned he filled the sack some time in that day, but was not with Henshaw when he took it away; I had employed Henshaw a little before; I took up Powell, at whose house I found it; he is a hackney-coachman
, who said he was not at home when it was brought, but he offered to pay me for them.

            . I am servant to Abbot, a carver, he rents part of this granary of Mr. Simpson, for a workshop; it is partitioned off, but there is a way to get out of one into the other, because we have wood in his granary; Henshaw came on the 24th of July, and called for Ballard; I said he was not there; he asked leave to come through our shop, and said Mr. Simpson wanted him to bring a sack of oats; he went in and took a sack, and carried it out; I watched him to the top of Fleet-ditch.

            . I had been to get a pint of beer at

                  Cain 
               



            's in the Fleet-market; Henshaw came drunk with a sack of oats on his back, he was not able to carry them; I and another man carried them for him; he showed us to a coachman in Hat and Tun-yard; when we came up stairs, the poor woman said, Lord have mercy upon me, why do you do so, we shall be all hanged; then I mistrusted he had stolen them; I think this was the 4th or 5th of August.
Prosecutor. I never gave Henshaw directions to go to my granary for oats.
Ballard's defence.
These oats were some that ran through the screen, and I had fanned the dust out of them; I thought them my property.
Prosecutor. There is no such thing allowed; these were very good oats, they cost me eighteen shillings and six-pence at the market.
Henshaw's defence.
I was out of place, and Ballard asked me to carry a sack for him, and he paid me for carrying them.

               Guilty

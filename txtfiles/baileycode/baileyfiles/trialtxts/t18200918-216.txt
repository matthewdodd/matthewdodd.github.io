            . I keep a floor-cloth manufactury
, at Knightsbridge


. On the 9th of August, I found the prisoner in custody with this floorcloth, which is mine,


                  WILLIAM 
                  PEARSON
               



            . I am a broker, and live in Old-street. On the 8th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner brought this floorcloth for sale, and asked 6 s. for it-it is worth 21 s., which made me suspect him. I asked him where he got it? he said a man sent him to sell it; I told him to send the man. He left the shop, went a step or two up the road, and loitered about for ten minutes. I kept my eye upon him. He returned and said the man was not at home, and demanded the floorcloth, or if I would buy it, I should have it for 5 s. I detained him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

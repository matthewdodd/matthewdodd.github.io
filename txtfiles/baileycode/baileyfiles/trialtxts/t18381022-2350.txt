JEMIMA GIBBS
. I am a widow, and live in Mornington-place, Hampstead-road. I had an apartment at Mrs. Warren's—I left a trunk of things there, when I went to France—I missed the articles stated—these are some of my things—(examining them.)

Prisoner. Mrs. Warren's brother broke the chest to see what was in it.





ELIZABETH WARREN
. This chest was left in my care—I went into the room one day, and saw it turned up and opened—I told the prisoner she

ought to be very careful as it was not mine—on the 29th, I went into her room and found these articles between the mattress and the bed—I then sent for a policeman, who took her—my brother did not open the chest—I found the ticket of the shawl in her pocket.

Prisoner. She had her brother to break it open, to see whether there was the value of her rent left in her box.





WILLIAM BRITTAIN
. I produce the shawl—the prisoner pledged it with me, and this is the duplicate.

Primer's Defence. I did not pledge it, but I bought the duplicate—I never touched the chest, and know nothing about what was in it.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

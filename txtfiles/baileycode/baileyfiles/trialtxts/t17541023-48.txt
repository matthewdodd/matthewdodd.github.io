                        Edward, otherwise John Rowland



                  , and divers others, that they came into her house, made a great riot in her house, and swore they would set her house on fire, and did put her in fear of her life, and did beat and abuse her and 
                     
                        John 
                        Stevens 
                     



                  , and raised a mob of 200 people round her house, and encouraged them with money to abuse her and 
                     
                        John 
                        Stevens 
                     



                  , her servant, on the 14th and 17th of July
            .


                  Benjamin 
                  Thomas 
               



            . produces an information say before the late Lord Chief Justice Lee, by 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



             and 
               
                  John 
                  Stevens 
               



            , Aug. 1, 1753, I believe the defendant at the bar is the woman that swore it. I remember her the better, she being with me 2 or 3 times about it.
Q. Did you see her sign it?
Thomas. I believe I saw her sign it, or acknowledge it to be her mark, and also that I swore her, which is always done previous to the caption. I have no doubt in the world but that the person who signed this information was sworn.
Q. Here is a place erased, and also an interlineation in another place on it; did you observe them before it was sworn?
Thomas. I can't say I remember them.
Mr. Hill. I saw the woman at the bar come to Guildhall, and heard Mr. Thomas administer the oath to her. I kept the door there.
Q. Can you take upon you to say this is the information, which she swore, without alteration ?
Hill I cannot say.


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . I know 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



            , I had a warrant against 
               
                  Edward 
                  Rowland 
               



            , 
               
                  John 
                  Ashmore 
               



            , 
               
                  William 
                  Fitzmorris 
               



            , and 
               
                  Richard 
                  Benton 
               



            , upon an information she made. He produced the warrant. I took up William Fitzmorris, 
               
                  John 
                  Ashmore 
               



            , and 
               
                  Richard 
                  Benton 
               



             on the 3d of Aug. 1753. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



             came to me several times about that since, and talked to me about it. I heard her say she had been sworn : and one 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Westbyer 
               



             appeared as her solicitor on this occasion. He told me at Guildhall coffee-house, on the 8th of August, that neither Stevens nor Blynn were sworn to that information, upon which I went to Guildhall and met Mrs. Blynn; I asked her whether she was sworn or not to the information. She told me she had been sworn to the information, and if there were occasion she would go before my lord, and swear it again. This I made a memorandum of.
Q. Did you take up any others by virtue of that warrant?
Carter. I believe I took up 5 more Some gave notice and put in bail, and never were in custody. There were 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Thorp 
               



            , 
               
                  Robert 
                  Baskerville 
               



            , 
               
                  Edward 
                  Rowland 
               



            , and one Trottman: there are eleven in all in the information.


                  Edward 
                  Rowland 
               



            . I never was in the prisoner's house in my life, nor never spoke to Stevens or her to my knowledge, nor had any concern with either of them.
Q. Was you in her house in the year 1753, breaking the windows?
Rowland. No, never in my life, I never had any conversation or concern with her about what she has charged me with. When I was told there was a warrant, and some people taken up, and that I was in it, I sent notice to the prisoner of bail, and took two of my neighbours, and bailed it at justice Fielding's.
Q. Was you in a mob about her door?
Rowland. I never saw a mob there. I saw as I was in my own house 
               
                  John 
                  Stevens 
               



             arrested.
Q. Was you bail for any person?
Rowland. I was bail for Mr. Thorp


                  Mary 
                  Beesmore 
               



            . I have heard 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



             frequently say to Mr. Stevens, and swear besides, wishing many a bitter wish, she would have revenge of Mr. Rowland, because he was an acquaintance of that rogue Thorp, that keeps the Ship, and that she would drive the place of them both.
Q. Where do you live?
M. Beesmore. I live in Petty-France, very near the Ship.
Q. How came you to hear her say this ?
M. Beezmore. I frequently went to her house about the time of these quarrels.
Q. What was the cause of her animosity against Thorp?
M. Beezmore. I can't tell. I have heard her say many a time his sign should be pulled down; and she would drive the place of him and Rowland.


                  Sarah 
                  Jacobs 
               



            . I lived 4 months in Jane Blynn's house when she lived in Goswell Street. I have heard 
               
                  John 
                  Stevens 
               



             and she together talking, and she has said she would never leave Rowland, or rest, till she had made a sacrifice of him, Ashmore, and Thorp. This I have heard her declare many a time.
Q. How came you to live with her?
S. Jacobs. I was with her to appraise some pawned goods to make a sale of them; she brought them with her from Westminster.
Q. Do you know what reason she gave for her saying so?
S. Jacobs. I know not the reason. But she said they were a combination of thieves and blackguards, and Mr. Salt at the Gatehouse was the biggest of them all, and that she would make beggars of them all; I have heard her say she did not know them to be acquainted with them. She sent for me, when she went out of her house, and said, Mrs. Jacobs you are a very honest woman, your word will go in a court, you never was brought in question; you must swear that Thorp, Ashmore and Rowland came every day to the door, and threatened to have us out life and limb when we came upon trial (this was after she could not get bail) She told me she was sadly afraid Mr. Waters does not do me justice; come along with me and let me examine him. He gave her but little encouragement in her affair, and she seemed to be afraid of him. She said also, that Stevens's character was so bad that she would not take her trial with him, for if she did she should be cast; and you must say he is gone you know not where; she said she would say so, and then I might after her; said I, can you say so before the face of a judge, when you put him out of the way for a day or two?
Q. How long was you in her house?
L. Jacobs. I was 4 months there; I never saw her since because I would not swear it. The reason of my going to her first was, my husband had pawned some things there, when she lived in the Broad-way, Westminster, and she was gone and we could not find her; at last we found her in Goswell street, and she said we were forced to come away from there because there was no peace.


                  Isaac 
                  Thorp 
               



            . I was indicted at Westminster sessions by 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



            , and Mr. Rowland was my bail. I never spoke to 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



             in my life to my knowledge.
Joannah Russel. I have been chairwoman to 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



            . I have seen many disturbances at the door.
Q. Did you ever see Ashmore, Thorp or Rowland in any mobs at the door?
Russel. No, never in my life; the prisoner used to keep her door locked; I used to give answers for them to people that wanted their goods which they had pawned; these were all the riots that I saw; and she and Stevens would not let them have them, although they brought their money in their hands.
Simon Jacobs. I have heard 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



             say many a time she would be the ruin of Thorp and Ashmore, and said, we must do it for them, for they are the best feathers to pluck; and that she'd not leave one a pot of beer to draw, or the other a loaf of bread (one being a baker, the other kept an ale-house) and says Stevens, I'll get a sheep's heart and take the congealed blood out and say it was human blood from their beating.


                  Thomas 
                  Jennings 
               



            , I lived next door but one to 
               
                  Jane 
                  Blynn 
               



            ; there was frequently rioting at the door by people for their goods, which they had pawned, when they used to deny them entrance.
For the Prisoner.


                  Martha 
                  Smith 
               



            . I remember on the 17th of July, when Mr. Stevens was arrested, it was just by Mr. Thorp's door; Mr. Thorp was looking out at his window; Mr. Stevens shewed his supersedeas; they abused him very much; the man made the best of his way to his own apartment; Mr. Thorp followed him to his own house, that is Mrs. Blynn's,
Q. Did you see Mr. Rowland at that time?
M. Smith. I cannot say in particular I know Mr. Rowland.
Q. Did you hear his name mentioned?
M. Smith. I did not indeed in the riot; but I heard Mr. Fitz Morris's wife say that Rowland and Thorpe were in the riot with her husband, and one Trotman.
Q. How long have you known Mrs. Blynn?
M. Smith. I have known her near 30 years; the first of my knowing her was when she lived in a court in Fleetstreet.
Q. In the course of 30 years how many times have you been an evidence for her?
M. Smith. I was for Mr. Stevens, when he exhibited the articles of peace against these people, and never any other time.


                  Thomas 
                  Cook 
               



            . I live next door to Mrs. Blynn; I remember there has been riots more than once or twice.
Q. Did you ever see Rowland there?
Cook. I cannot say I ever did; I have seen him before the justice when the warrant had been served; I know one 
               
                  James 
                  Neal 
               



             told me he was in the riot.
Q. to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Jacobs 
               



            . Do you know any thing of this 
               
                  Martha 
                  Smith 
               



            ?


                  Sarah 
                  Jacobs 
               



            . I have heard her say many a time she has swore several times for 
               
                  Jenny 
                  Blynn 
               



            , and d - n'd her soul for her, and now instead of speaking for her she would say the contrary, and if she said the truth of her she must say she was both thief and whore.
Q. What is the general character of Smith?
L. Jacobs. Upon my oath she is a very terrible woman, and I believe would not value swearing any body's life away.



               Guilty

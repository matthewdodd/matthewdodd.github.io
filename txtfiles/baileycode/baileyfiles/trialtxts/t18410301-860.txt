WILLIAM HUMPHREYS
 was indicted

for embezzlement.






OWEN HILES
. I am a baker, living at Shoreditch. The prisoner had been in my service six weeks—he ought to account for what money he received every night—that was my regular course of dealing.





MARIA SIMPKINS
. I deal with the prosecutor; the prisoner supplied me with bread on his account. On the 1st of February I paid him 11 1/4 d. on account of his master—I gave him a shilling, and he gave me 3/4 d. out—I paid him 11 1/4 d. more on the 5th.





MARY ANN MOORE
. I deal with Mr. Hiles for bread—I paid the prisoner 3 1/2 d., on the 5th of February, on his master's account.





OWEN HILES

re-examined. The prisoner only accounted to me for 3 3/4 d. which he received on the 1st of February—7 1/2 d. was lost to me—he told me he had received it on that night, and that was all he had received—I never spoke to him about what he had received on the 5th—he did not account to me for the 3 1/2 d.—I had no conversation with him about it—I went round and inquired, and had him taken up—I have never had the money.

Prisoner's Defence. When I took out my bread of a morning, he counted what I took out, and what I brought back, and he saw it was correct; on the 5th of February Simpkin said, "We don't want so much bread, we have been obliged to buy some;" they did not take so much in; I was rather late that day.

JURY
to
OWEN HILES. Q. Were you not in the habit of counting the

bread taken out, and counting it when it came back? A. On the 1st I did not, and on the 5th I went to Walthamstow—I did not book his bread till Saturday, and then he was two quartern loaves deficient, which he accounted for when I booked his bread—on the 5th he had five loaves out, and only accounted for three; and a few days before that my wife saw him come into the shop and take three.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

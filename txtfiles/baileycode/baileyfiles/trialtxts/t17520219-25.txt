            . I live at the upper end of Drury-lane. As I was in Fleet-market


 going home on the 17th of Feb. between twelve and one at night, the prisoner came up to me and snatched my hat from my head, and away he ran ; he never was out of my sight before he was taken; I pursued him to the top of the market, and there he was stopped: when he was taken he had my hat in his hand, and anot or on his head.

            . I was coming along and heard the cry. Stop Thief! I took hold or him: he had a hat under his arm, which the prosecutor owned, and another on his head.
Prisoner's defence.
I was much in liquor, and know no more of it than nothing at all.

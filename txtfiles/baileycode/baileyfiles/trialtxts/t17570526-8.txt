                  Agit 
               



            . I am wife to 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Agit 
               



            . I lost the things mention'd in the indictment, from out of a drawer in the room where the prisoner lay. She work'd for me.
Q. Was the drawer lock'd?
F. Agit. It was not.
Q. How long had the prisoner lain in your house?
F. Agit. About eight weeks.
Q. How came you to suspect her?
F. Agit. She took one of my candlesticks to a tenant that lodged in the next room, and wanted her to go and pawn it for her.
Q. Do you know this of your own knowledge?
F. Agit. No, but that tenant came down and told me so, and bid me take care of her; then I went up-stairs to look for my things, and found the goods mention'd in the indictment were missing.
Q. When had you seen them before?
F. Agit. I am sure they were all there the over-night. We took her up, and in the watch-house she own'd she had taken and pawn'd them to one Gibbs, a pawnbroker in Shoe-Lane, where we went and found them. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)
Mr. Gibbs. The prisoner is the person that pawn'd these goods with me.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was in want of money, and my own cloaths were in pawn, and being obliged to go to a gentleman to get some money, I took these things and pledg'd them; I did intend to have got them out again, but instead of that they took and carried me away to prison.

HENRY MALLANDINE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of July, 1 waistcoat, value 1s. 6d., and 1 pair of trowsers, 1s.; the goods of 



John Hunter; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN HUNTER
. About half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 10th of July, I had a waistcoat and a pair of trowsers hanging outside my door, with a quantity of things—about half-past ten the officer brought in the prisoner with the waistcoat and trowsers—these now produced are them.





JAMES ATTWOOD
 (policeman.) I was in the Bethnal-green-road on the 10th of July—about half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner go up to the prosecutor's shop, take the waistcoat, put it under his coat, afterwards take the trowsers, and run away—I took him back to the prosecutor.


Prisoner. I was running after two boys when he took me, he did not find the trowsers on me—he ran after me with them in his hand, and the waistcoat he had afterwards—I do not know how he came by them. Witness. He ran up against a young man, and dropped the trowsers—I took them up with one hand, and took him with the other.





GEORGE TEAKLE
 (police-sergeant H 8.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

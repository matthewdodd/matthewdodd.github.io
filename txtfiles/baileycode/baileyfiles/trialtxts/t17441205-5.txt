. The Prisoner at the bar called for a pint of beer, and wanted a steak broiled, which was done. My wife had been wetting some linen for ironing, and had rolled them up in a cloth. The Prisoner came out, and said, I paid your wife for the beer; but my wife missing the things, ran after her, and brought her back.

            . The Prisoner desired a steak to be broiled, and out of compassion I did it for her. I asked her how she came by it, for I had a suspicion she stole it. She said, she gave a penny for it. I missed the things, and followed her. I asked her if she did not see a bundle that lay there. She said, Yes, here they are, Madam, if you will have them. I made answer, Yes, I will have them, and you too: Then she begged I would forgive her, and said she never did any such thing before.

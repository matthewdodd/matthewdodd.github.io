            . I am a hatter
. I was at the Auction Mart, Threadneedle-street


, and while I was holding my hand out to take a catalogue, I felt a hand in my pocket, and when I put my hand down I found my pocket-book was gone. I then looked round, and saw the prisoner standing close by me. I looked at him very earnest. On my looking at him, he moved to another part of the room. I followed him, and still kept my eye on him, and after looking at him some time I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him that I would thank him for a pocket-book that he had on him that did not belong to him. His answer was, that he had none. A gentleman that was standing by the side of him said he had dropped a pocket-book. I picked it up, and saw it was my own pocket-book. This is the pocket-book. It is mine.

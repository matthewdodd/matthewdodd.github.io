 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of January, 3 gowns, value 6s.; 1 cloak, value 3s.; 1 apron, value 4d.; 1 petticoat, value 1s.; the goods of 



Sarah Sheffield.






SARAH SHEFFIELD
. I am a widow, and live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner is my daughter—I get my living by needlework. The property is mine—I have four children, one older than the prisoner—the prisoner took some things from my house, and some from where my other daughter Elizabeth was in service—she was leaving her place, and she gave her things to the prisoner to bring to my House, but she never brought them home—she has been in different little places—these three gowns, and a cloak, and apron, and petticoat, were taken from my room—I made inquiries, and found them at the pawnbroker's—the prisoner produced these duplicates at the office—I went to Mr. Edwards's, in Crawford-street, where she had been three days, while the servant was out—I asked her for my things—she said she never had them—I sent for an officer, and took her—this is one of my gowns—(examining the articles)—this cloak is her sister's.





ELIZABETH SHEFFIELD
. I am the prisoner's sister. This cloak is mine.





SAMUEL PENN
. I am assistant to a pawnbroker. This property was pawned by the prisoner—I asked her some questions respecting her age, but I forget her answer—I never receive property without a satisfactory answer—she must have told me she was sixteen years old, or I should not have taken them.


Prisoner. You never asked me the question. Witness. It is a precaution I invariably use.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.—To be sent to the Penitentiary.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

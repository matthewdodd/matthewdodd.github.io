             is a servant
 out of place; she slept with me; my apartment was over Captain Lascelles' stables; she brought some things there: on the evening of the 1st of August the things in the indictment (enumerating them) were taken away: the things belonging to my husband were worth five pounds: I left the prisoner in care of the place when I went out, and when I came home I found the stable door open; I returned about a quarter before nine: the prisoner was missing, and the things gone, and my room door was open; I double locked my room door when I went out, and left the prisoner in the stable; I saw the things at Justice Bond's, in Bow-street.
(The things produced and deposed to.)
Court. Is there any door out of the house into the stable? - Yes; but it is always fastened on both sides.

I took the prisoner with the things the 2d of August, at a publick-house at Hounslow; he had all the property except two pair of stockings and a pair of buckles; some were tied up; a waistcoat and shirt on his back, and a coat ready to put on.
Prisoner. I hope you will all be merciful to me: I was very much in liquor: I have not a friend within a hundred miles.

             sworn.
I am shopman to 
               
                  Peter
                   Leyburn
               



            , in Houndsditch


; on Friday the 5th of October, between three and four in the afternoon, the two prisoners came to the shop of 
               
                  Peter
                   Leyburn
               



             together; I am sure it was them, they asked to look at some muslins, I shewed them different kinds, each party seem to take great pains in saying, some were too coarse, some too dear, till I had shewn a number of pieces, but one was fixed on, the quantity agreed on, was half a yard, at 2 s. 6 d. per yard; I turned round to look for the measure, and not finding one at hand, the two or three pieces that I opened, I laid on the remaining part of the wrappers that were not opened, and then I went to another part of the shop for a measure; immediately on my return, I cut the half yard, a shilling was laying on the counter, but they desired me to take seven-pence, abating the halfpenny; they both spoke; I opposed it, saying, which laid down the shilling, but at the time the change was offered, they both claimed the change; each saying, they laid down the money, and it was a considerable time before I could satisfy them with the change; I do not know which of them laid down the shilling; immediately upon giving the change, the prisoners both went toward the door; I laid the change on the counter, and 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Jones
               



             took the change.
Which took the muslin? - 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Cummins
               



            ; as Jones went to the door, I perceived her step somewhat singularly; she could not walk, but shuffled along; this gave me some suspicion that she had something; and also from their behaviour in taking particular pains in tumbling the muslins, tho' I endeavoured to prevent it by giving a watchful look out; they both went out of the shop together; I looked carefully over the muslins, and missed one that I had seen that morning; I immediately followed them, at the distance of four or five doors I overtook them; they were walking and talking to each other; I took each by the arm, and requested them to return, and wait in a part of the shop, distant from the counter, and from the other customers till a peace-officer came, which I sent for; 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Jones
               



            , while the boy was gone for the officer, rushed out of my hand; I attempted to keep hold of them; they tried to rush out of a door that was fast; some customers were standing near the door close to the counter, the shuffled round them to a different part of the counter where there was no customers; I saw her immediately drop the muslin, it was concealedunder her coats, she had dropped it without any difficulty; I am clear I saw it drop; I took up the muslin from the ground, and required them to stand aside till the constable came; Jones immediately went down on her knees and ask'd forgiveness; I told her she could not expect forgiveness, as it was not the first offence in our shop.
What did the woman say? - They each of them wanted a quarter of a yard of muslin, but the muslin did not suit her to have a quarter of a yard, that was the defence the other one made; the other said she had no knowledge about Jones's taking the muslin.
Court. Did you see this muslin taken? - No.
Who else was in the shop besides you? - There were several customers.
Who else belonging to the shop? - There were Mr. Leyburn, and two other assistants in the shop at the time.
Are any of them here? - No.

             sworn.
I took charge of the prisoners, and the piece of muslin; I have had it ever since.
Prosecutor. This is the piece I saw drop from Jones, it is my master's property, it has our private shop mark, marked by me.
PRISONER JONES's DEFENCE.
I had but just done selling my fruit

; I went to Rag-fair to buy me an old gown; I know the prisoner by selling fruit; she asked me to go with her, and she bought the muslin for 7 d. the man came out, and he found a piece of muslin on the ground; I never took it, there were three women with bedgowns just by the windows.
PRISONER CUMMINS's DEFENCE.
I had been out with fruit in the morning; I met this young woman, and asked her to go with me; we went and bought this quarter of a yard of muslin, and paid for it; I looked over none.
Court to Bell. Were any of the other customers near the place where she dropped the muslin? - No.
Are you perfectly sure you saw her drop it? - Yes.
To Prisoner. Have you any witnesses to your character? - I have none but God Almighty and you.

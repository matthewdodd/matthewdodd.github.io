WILLIAM ASHTON
 and

 were indicted for

 stealing, on the

William Greenfield, from his person.






WILLIAM GREENFIELD
. I live in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. I was in Chancery-lane at eight o'clock on the 13th of November—I felt something at. my pocket, which induced me to turn round—I saw Smith passing a handkerchief to Ashton, who immediately crossed the road—I laid hold of Smith—Ashton again crossed, and I laid hold of him—in the

scuffle Smith got away, and the handkerchief was thrown into the gutter—this is the same handkerchief—it is mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you pick it up? A. No—a gentleman who is not here did—I am a law-stationer—Ashton came up, and collared Smith.





JAMES TURNER
. I live in Horse-shoe-court. I was passing just at the time—I saw the prosecutor lay hold of Smith, and then I saw Ashton cross the road to the prosecutor, and Smith escaped—Ashton dropped the handkerchief down in the road—I am sure of that.

Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A porter—I was about three yards off—it was when the prosecutor seized Ashton that Smith got away—I saw the handkerchief picked up by a gentleman, who is not here—I pursued Smith, and told the policeman of it.





GEORGE WARDLE
 (City police-constable, No. 484.) I received the hand-kerchief from the prosecutor.

Smith. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.
(Sarah Castellon, wife of a porter, in the Old Bailey, and Michael Carney, father-in-law of Ashton, gave him a good character.)

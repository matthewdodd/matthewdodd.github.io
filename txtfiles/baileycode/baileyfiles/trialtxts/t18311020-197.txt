HENRY SPICER. I live in Farringdon-street, and am a stationer
. On the 20th of October I was at Spring-gardens


, between one and two o'clock; I felt some one rubbing against me - I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; when he saw me look at him, he dropped it - I took it, and secured him; he did not struggle at first, but when I got him to the top of the passage there appeared to be nearly a dozen round me - one of them came running up, and said he would show me where a Police-station was; he took me across by the National Repository, and was going up a court, but I would not go; I asked a woman at a stall where the station was - she directed me to Scotland-yard - I was taking the prisoner there, and then he struggled and struck me; a soldier came to my assistance, and he was given into custody.

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of Spring-gardens - there were a great many people; the prosecutor seized me, and said I had robbed him - he dragged me about; I tried to put him away - he seized my handkerchief, and would not let me go, but took me down to Charing-cross, where half a dozen Policemen jumped on me directly.

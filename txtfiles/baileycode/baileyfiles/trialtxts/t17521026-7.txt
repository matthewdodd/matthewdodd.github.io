Mary Cole. I live at the Greyhound inn, Drury Lane


. The prisoner came and asked me for a lodging; I let her have a bed. After she was gone, the next day, which was the ninth of October, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment out of my room.

Q. Did you know her before?


                  Mary 
                  Cole 
               



            . No, I did not. I found her by inquiring about, at a barber's shop, the woman had got my shift in a wash tub, the prisoner waiting till it was washed. I charged the prisoner with taking the things, and she confess'd taking them all but the handkerchiefs. She told me she had sold the stays for 13 s. she had my petticoat on. That produced in court, and deposed to.
Prisoner's Defence.
I lay at the Greyhound Inn, Drury Lane, up two pair of stairs, along with a man; these things were given me there. I have lain there a great many times; it is a bawdy house.

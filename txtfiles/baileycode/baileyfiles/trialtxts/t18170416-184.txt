            . I am a constable. I was at Stepney Fair, and saw the prisoner, with two other boys, there; the prisoner stood in the middle of them, behind Mr. Hall. I saw him draw the handkerchief out of Mr. Hall's pocket-the other two stood on each side of him; I collared him, and he dropped the handkerchief. I found two more handkerchiefs upon him, besides the duplicate of another.

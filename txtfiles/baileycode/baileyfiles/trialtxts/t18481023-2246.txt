JAMES BWYE
. I live at Tottenham. On 19th Sept., about one o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing from Wagon-horse-lane to Willoughby-lane, I saw the prisoner—he held up a large rat by the tail—he seemed to beckon me—I did not like his appearance, and walked on—he came to my side, and said something about gin—I took no notice—he then came on my left side, and pushed me into a ditch six or seven feet deep—I rolled down—he came down, put his legs across me, and took my watch, seal, key, and ribbon from my fob—he scrambled up, and was away in a minute—I got up as soon a I could, and gave information.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Was he tipsy? A. He might he rather—I felt him take my watch—I did not see it—I may have seen him before—his mother has been with me since this—he did not fall into the ditch.

I saw the prisoner at my lock, between two and three o'clock—he leaned over a barge, and a watch fell out of his pocket into the barge—he jumped down, got it, and looked at the face—I saw a ribbon attached to it, which appeared to be black—before he got into the barge he said, "You have no occasion to say you have seen me.

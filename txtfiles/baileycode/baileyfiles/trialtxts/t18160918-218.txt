            . In the evening of the 17th of August last, I happened to be walking with a young lady in Finsbury-square


; and the prisoner ran up against me with such violence as separated me from the young lady; he seemed staggering as if he were drunk before he came up to me. I immediately missed my watch from my fob, and I directly pursued the prisoner. I called watch, and collared him just as be turned the corner; and never lost sight of him. A struggle took place, and I pulled him to the ground. Then he threw the watch away, and a young man brought the watch; and two or three gentlemen came to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured.
HENRY THORNGATE. The prosecntor said to the prisoner, you have got my watch; I saw them fall together, and I saw the prisoner try to stop the prosecutor calling, by putting his hand upon his mouth; and I saw the prisoner throw the watch away with his right hand.

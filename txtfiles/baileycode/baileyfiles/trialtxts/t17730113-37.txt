Isabella Cummings. I live in East Smithfield


, and take care of one Mr. Tafe's house, as his house-keeper
; about a week before this, the linen shift was in a clothes basket in Mr. Tafe's room; the bed gown was in a different place in the same room; the prisoner was a lodger in the house for six months during the time I continued there, and had been before I came to live there. I saw these things about eight in the evening; I missed them next morning between nine and ten; upon that I made a great noise, and a Runner of Justice Sherwood's asked me if I missed any thing; I said I did; I went to the Justice's and there I saw the prisoner; he owned he took the things by getting through a window; he got them out at the window; the door was locked; he went out soon after I had seen the things, and locked the door and took the key with him, he came back in the morning as a watchman. When I went into the room I missed the things.

            . I am an old-clothes-man; as I was coming home in the evening, I cannot say the night precisely, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner offered to sell me these things; I stopped him.

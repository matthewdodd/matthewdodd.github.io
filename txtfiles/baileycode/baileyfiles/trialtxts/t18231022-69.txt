            . I live in Weymouth-mews. On the 12th of September, the prisoner came and said a gentleman at his father's wanted to put a chariot out to hire, and he wanted a collar to bring it away - I called my boy down, who said he knew him; he was to bring the chariot that morning, and take away a chaise on hire, but I never saw him again.

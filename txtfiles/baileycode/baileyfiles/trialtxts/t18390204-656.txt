ROBERT RAWLIN
. I am a tailor, and live in Cross-street, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. A little before nine o'clock, on the 21st of January, I went into my shop and missed two waistcoat pieces, and a remnant of cloth—I found the glass of the window broken—it had been cracked previously, but there was no aperture in it before—I had seen it whole at noon—the goods could be drawn through the hole.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 8.) On the night of the 21st January, about half-past eight o'clock, I was coming through Cross-street, Hoxton, and saw the prisoner about ten yards from the prosecutor's shop, running very fast—I followed him till he got into the City-road, and took from under his jacket the waistcoat-piece and cloth—I asked where he got them—he said he picked them up—I took him to the station-house, and found a knife on him, which corresponded exactly with the marks on the putty of the prosecutor's window.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I hope you will forgive me this time, and I will go to work.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

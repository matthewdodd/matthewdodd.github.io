WILLIAM FROST. I live in Kingsgate-street, and am foreman to Messrs. Young and Son, carpenters
. On Saturday, the 18th of November, I left the pay-table, and went to Soho on some business; I was returning about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, and met the prisoner in St. Giles - she wanted me to go with her, or to give her something, which I would not - she kept up with me on my way to Kingsgate-street, and, at the corner of Duke-street


 and Little Russel-street


, she left me - I turned, and saw her running - I put my hand to my pocket, and my watch was gone; I ran to the watchman, who followed her - he saw her put the watch down at a door-way, and took it up - she was taken directly.

            . I am a watchman. The witness told me he had lost his watch; I saw the prisoner run, put the watch down at the step of a door, and then run on; I took her, and found the watch at the step of the door - the prosecutor said, "She has got the watch;" I said, "No - she has put it down."(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from my aunt's - a girl ran by - the prosecutor ran up, and said he had stolen his watch; the watchman came, and looked about with his lantern; I stopped - he said he supposed I was like the girl, and took me.

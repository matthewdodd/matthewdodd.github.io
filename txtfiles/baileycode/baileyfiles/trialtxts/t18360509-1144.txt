JAMES LEONARD
. I live in Craven-street, Strand. On the 20th of April I was returning home, and about thirty yards from my door, I saw the prisoner coming out of the door of my house with a coat over his arm—I recognised it as belonging to my wife's uncle—the collar being lined with red—I quickened my pace, and found my door ajar—the prisoner had passed me, and turned into Northumberland-court—I found him running up Northumberland-street—I followed and secured him with it under his arm.





ADAM MAITLAND
. The coat is mine—it hung on a peg in Leonard's lobby.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress, and had no food the whole day.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—

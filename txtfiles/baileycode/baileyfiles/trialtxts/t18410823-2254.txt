JOHN LACK
. On the 20th of August I saw the prisoner in company with another person—the prisoner had the fustian on his shoulder—the prosecutrix came running after them—the prisoner and the other boy ran round Wellclose-square together—the prisoner carried the fustian till they got to Neptune-street, and then gave it to the other—a carman found it.





CATHERINE PARNHAM
. I am the wife of Benjamin Parnham—we keep an outfitting-warehouse for seamen, in Grace's-alley, Well-street. This fustian is our property—I saw the prisoner go out of our shop, with the fustian on his shoulders—I followed him and the other to the middle of Wellclose-square—I then returned and called my sister to mind my shop—I then went to the corner of Nortonpassage—there was a crowd there, and a carman went up a passage, and brought this fustian to me—the prisoner was not taken till last Thursday.




GUILTY

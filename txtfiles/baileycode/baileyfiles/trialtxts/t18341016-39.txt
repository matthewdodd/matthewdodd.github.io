            . I am a jeweller
, and live at No. 236, High Holborn


. On the 8th of October, I was standing at my counter - I had two pair of ear-rings on the case on the counter - the prisoner came in, and asked for Museum-street - I directed him - he stood a little while, and then threw some snuff close to my eyes - he snatched something off the glass case, and ran off - I followed him a little way, but was afraid to go further - I then returned, and called, "Stop thief" - a man came, and said he was taken- I went and found him in custody - I am quite sure he is the man - these are my ear-rings; they are worth 7s. - they were gone when the prisoner was gone.

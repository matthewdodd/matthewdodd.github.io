WILLIAM CHAPMAN. I am a servant
. On the 15th of December I was in Spur-street, Leicester-square


, about eleven o'clock in the morning, looking into a picture-shop. The prisoner and two others rushed against me all at once. I felt some person at my pocket, put my hand into it, and missed my handkerchief. I turned round, saw it in the prisoner's hand, and Jefferson holding him.
WILLIAM JEFFERSON. I am a Bow-street officer. On the 15th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, in company with two others, at the picture-shop in Spur-street - I saw them close up behind the prosecutor; the prisoner put his hand behind him with the handkerchief. I secured him-the prosecutor claimed it. I found three more in his hat.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

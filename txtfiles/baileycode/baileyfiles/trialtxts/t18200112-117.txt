, and live in Vine-street, Grosvenor-square


; these things were in my bedroom, and I missed them at different times. There is a counting-house at the bottom of the stairs - the door is open in the daytime.

            . I live at Hammersmith; my uncle lodges at Varley's. On the 24th of December I was standing on the second floor stair-case, saw the prisoner come up stairs, and ask for the clergyman who lived on the second floor? he was told he was not at home, and he said he would call again in about a quarter of an hour; Mrs. Varley suspected him, and I watched him from the opposite room. In about twenty minutes he came up stairs gently, and went into Varley's bedroom without knocking at the clergyman's door; he took a pair of shoes, and was disturbed by Miss Varley coming up stairs. As he was coming out of the room, I saw him putting the shoes into his pocket, stopped him immediately, and found one on him - he threw the other under the bed.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded distress.

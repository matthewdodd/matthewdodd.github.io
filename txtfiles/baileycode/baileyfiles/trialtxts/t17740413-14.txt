            . I am a salesman
 in St. James's market


; the prisoner and another man came to me to buy a truss of hay and a truss of straw; they asked the price of it; I told them sixteen pence the hay, and eight pence the straw; the other man pulled out the money and paid me for it; he gave me two sixpences, one of which was bad; the prisoner came back and said the other man had given me a French shilling, he would take it again; I pulled out my purse, the prisoner put his hand in and took out three guineas; I said that was not the French shilling, and he put it in again; I searched the purse and missed a guinea; I afterwards looked and there was no French shilling in the purse.
- Jeffreys. I work in the yard; I saw the prisoner and Jenkins, whom I knew to be a bad one, about Maddie; I thought they were about no good; I kept my eye upon them; I saw the prisoner take something out of the purse; I came up to him immediately; Maddie had him then by the collar; I desired him to be taken into the house and searched, but no guinea was found upon him.
The prisoner in his defence denied the fact, but called no witnesses.

JOHN DAVIS CHALLENER. I am servant to Joseph Plimpton, who is a salesman
, and lives in Holborn


. On the 8th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was standing by the window-the prisoner took the boots off the hook by the door, came into the shop, asked me if I would take them in pledge, and then asked me to buy them. I said we were not pawnbrokers. I did not see him take them. Two gentlemen came to the door - I went round to them. The prisoner put the boots into his bosom, buttoned them up, and was going out - I then missed the boots from the door, stopped him, and asked him to let me see them, as I should know them by the private mark at the bottom. He said they were not our's. I gave him in charge. I am certain they hung at the door just before, and have my master's hand-writing on them.
WILLIAM JOHNSON. I took the prisoner in charge. He said he took the boots from the door, went in to ask the price of them, and said that they would fit him very well. They were lady's boots.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I took them down to buy them.

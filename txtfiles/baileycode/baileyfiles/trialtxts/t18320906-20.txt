            . I live at Bishop's Stortford, in Hertfordshire. On the 16th of July, between halfpast eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was on Holborn-bridge


 - I felt a jerk at my pocket, looked round, and saw the prisoner and a boy about three years older than him; I saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand - it was being handed from one to the other; I took it, and seized the prisoner, as he was the one who had it first - the other escaped; he said he found it on the ground.

SAMUEL SMITH. I keep the Coach and Horses, public-house, Conduit-street, Berkeley-square




. On the 18th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 47, Berkeley-square, and missed five pots from the area rails - the prisoner was seen putting them in a bag; he threw them away on being seen, but was secured. As he was going to the office I found two pint pots in his coat-pockets.

THOMAS FOX. I am a printer
. On the 6th of September, about eight o'clock at night, I was at St. BartholomewFair


; the prisoner stood close at my side; I saw him snatch my gold pin out of my shirt, and hand it over to his companion, saying
"Here Jack." I laid hold of him immediately, and asked him to give it me; but did not say what; he said he never saw it.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not accuse two or three others of it - A. No. My hands were confined, or I could have hundred him from taking it. I am certain it was him.
GUILTY. Aged 18.

            .




               Transported for Seven Years

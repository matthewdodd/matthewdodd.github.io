Anne Wall. I live in Golden-lane


. On the 13th of February I took the prisoner in as a lodger; I have only one room, she had the key to go in and out. I missed the things in the indictment, (mentioning them) and she was gone also. She was taken up by another person that she robb'd after me; I went and ask'd her after my things; she told me where to find them. I found the spoons and cloth accordingly, but the tea chest she had sold.

            . I heard the prisoner confess she had taken Mrs. Wall's things, and where she had pawn'd the spoons.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

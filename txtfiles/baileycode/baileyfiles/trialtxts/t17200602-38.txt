             and other persons, on the 2d of June
 last. It appeared that the prosecutor lives at Shackelwell


, and takes in Washing
; and that the Goods mentioned in the Indictment were hung in her Garden to dry; that the prisoner got in, took them off the Bushes and threw them over the Hedge into the Field, and went round and took them up, but being seen, was follow'd; which he perceiving, threw the Goods down in a Ditch and ran the length of two Fields, where he was stopt by a Brook and taken. The prisoner in his Defence said that he took up 6 Cloths in the Fields, and the prosecutor following him, he told her if they were hers she might have them; that he had taken a Great House in Hendon parish, which was now repairing; that he was Crasy sometimes, and had been Lunatick this Twelve-Month: but called none to prove it. The Jury considering the matter found him 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d

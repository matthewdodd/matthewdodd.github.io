            . I am the wife of William Hewes - he lives in Boswell-court, Devoushire-street, Queen-square


; the prisoner was an occasional servant
 - on the 26th of March I went out and left her with a little girl; I had put four spoons in a drawer in her presence, before I went out - I returned at nine o'clock in the evening, and she went away immediately; I missed the spoons on the Saturday at dinner time - I went and asked if she had them; she denied it - as I was coming out she called me back and said she had taken them, and gave me the duplicate.

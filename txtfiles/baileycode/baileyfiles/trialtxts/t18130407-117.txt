            . On the 5th of March, the prisoner came in for five-penny worth of meat. I cut it her. She then asked me to cut her another five-pennyworth; she had a friend waiting outside; she would go and call her in, and as soon as she was gone from my house I missed my watch from off the mantle-shelf. We pursued her into the next street. She came back with me, and asked me what I wanted. I told her that she had taken my watch from off the mantle-shelf. My husband went for an officer, and before the officer came she delivered me the watch.
Q. Do you know any thing of her - A. No. I never saw her before.
Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the watch before the prosecutrix opened a cupboard and put it on the table. The officer took it off the table.

JOHN FORSTER
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Tottenham Court-road. On the 14th of 8ept. I met the prisoner in the New-road—she asked me for something to drink—she said she had had nothing since the morning—I west with her to a public-house, and paid for a quartern of gin, and then wished her to go about her business—she kept hanging about me, and I found my pocket in which I had three half-crowns and two shillings, turned inside out—I gave her in charge—on the way to the station she dropped half-a-crown,

which the policeman picked up—I had no intention of having anything to do with her—it was in the public market—I never took any liberties with her.





DAVID DRISCOLL
. I was passing through Fitzroy—market—the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him, and I took her—in going to the station I heard something fall on the pavement from her person—it was half. a—crown.

Prisoner. It fell from my person, and was my own. Witness. Before it dropped she said she had no money—when it dropped she said, "I dropped nothing"—at the station she said it was her own.





GEORGE MANNING
 (policeman.) I visit the cells at the station—I went in next morning and rose the prisoner up—a shilling dropped from her clothes—she said it was given her by one of the other prisoners.

Defence. The 3s. 6d. found on me was my own.

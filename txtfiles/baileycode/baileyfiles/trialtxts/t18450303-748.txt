WILLIAM HALL
 was indicted

for stealing 2 pairs of shoes, value 10s.; and 1 pair of boots, 8s.; the goods of 



Samuel Warren, his master.






SAMUEL WARREN
. I live in Reliance-square, New Inn-yard, Shoreditch, and am a shoemaker. The prisoner came into my employ from his mother, on the 9th of Jan., and remained till the 11th—at ten minutes past eight o'clock that morning I left him alone in my work-room, and gave him some orders about two pairs of shoes—he came down about five minutes after, and said he was going to get some butter—he left, and new came back—in five minutes or less I went to the workshop, and missed two pairs of new shoes and a pair of footed boots—no one had been there but him—the shoes were mine, and the boots belonged to an inmate of mine, but were in my care—I never knew the prisoner before.

Prisoner. I never saw the things.





GEORGE TEAKLE
 (police-sergeant H 8.) I took the prisoner on another charge.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted 3rd April, 1843, confined six months and twice whipped)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

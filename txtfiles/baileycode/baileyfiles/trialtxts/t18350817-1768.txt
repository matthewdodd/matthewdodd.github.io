1768. 




RICHARD MITCHELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of June, 6 sovereigns, 4 shillings, 1 sixpence, and 4 pence in copper, the monies of 



Charles Wright, his master.






CHRISTOPHER FIDGE
. I am in the service of Mr. Charles Wright—the prisoner was in his service—on the 12th of June I gave him 6l. 4s. 10d. to pay to Edward Scott, the carrier, for goods received from Mr. John Dee.





EDWARD SCOTT
. The prisoner came to me on the 12th of June—he gave me a bill, and 5s. 8d. for the carriage—he said the money was to be paid into the Cambridge bank, for meat that came from Mr. John Gee, of Sherborn.

Prisoner. I did not give you the bill—a lad came, I offered him the bill, and he said Mr. Gee would be in town, and I must pay him—I paid the lad 5l. 10s.—you were not in town that day. Witness. Yes, I was, and you paid it to me, and gave me the bill—you came to me the week after, and said the money had been paid into the wrong bank—he said they paid it into the Bury bank—and then he said they had paid it into the Sudbury bank.

Prisoner. It is not worth while my standing here to tell what is not true, I acknowledge myself guilty—I had been led into expences, and my salary being too small to support my wife and family, I was induced to apply the sum mentioned to my own use, and had I been at liberty, I should have repaid it—but it was not this witness that I saw.




GUILTY
. Aged 35. 


Transported for Seven Years.
The prisoner pleaded guilty to a second charge of embezzlement.

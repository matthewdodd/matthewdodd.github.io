MRS. TOWNSHEND. My son keeps a pork-shop
. I live with him. On the 20th of October, the prisoner and two other men came into the shop for some pork. I served them with the pork, they paid me for it; in the mean time I saw the prisoner put some black puddings in his pocket. I am sure he is the man. I desired the prisoner to take them out of his pocket, he said he had nothing belonging to me. This was about eight o'clock at night; my son came home about five minutes afterwards, I told him of it, I saw the prisoner take them from the window, and put them into his side pocket.

            . As soon as I came in, my mother told me of it. I followed the prisoner to the watch-house, the night-officer being hungry, he cooked the black puddings, and ate them. They would not keep.
Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop. I bought two shillingsworth of pork, and I had the sausages in my handkerchief that I bought at the next shop; they dropped down, and I picked them up. This gentleman pursued me, he swore that I stole the sausages. I did not.

HENRY WORBOYS. I live in Homer-street, Mary-le-bone


, and am a stage-coachman
. On the 4th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I left my whip on the roof of the coach in the mews - the horses were not to the carriage - I returned in about an hour and a half, and it was gone - I saw it next morning in possession of the officer.

            . I am a patrol. On the evening of the 4th of October, I saw the prisoner kneeling on the step of a shop, and robbing the brass work of this whip on the step - when he saw me he crossed the road - I crossed, and asked him where he got it - he saidit was his own, and he found it in the Mary-le-bone-road the day before - it had been very wet the day before, and on the morning of that day, and I knew if he had found it it would have been dirty, but it was quite clean; I took him to the office.
Prisoner's Defence. About half past six o'clock that evening I was going up to Paddington - I picked up this whip, and got on to Brown-street, when the officer took me with it.

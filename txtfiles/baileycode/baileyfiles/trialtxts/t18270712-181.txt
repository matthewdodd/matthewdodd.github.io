MELVILLE MACPHERSON. I am an artist
. I was in St. Martin's-lane
, opposite the church, about eleven o'clock last Thursday night; I saw the prisoner and another lad, standing about, and making signals to one another - they passed me once or twice; I told them to walk on - they then both ran; I felt, and missed my handkerchief. I pursued and caught the prisoner - I found my handkerchief in his breast; the other got away.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it off the ground.

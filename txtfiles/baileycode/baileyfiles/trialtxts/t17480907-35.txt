            ; the 26th of August
.
Tho. Kilby. I lost a silver watch, and a brass key.
Q. Where did you lose it?
Kilby. At Bromley


 .
Q. What made you mistrust the prisoner?
Kilby. Because he was in the house the night before: his father and mother lodge in the house, but he does not. I went in search after him, and some people said they saw him at 8 o'clock at night playing with some boys.
Q. Did you find the watch?

Kilby. Yes; he said he had sold it to one Bazil Denn on London-bridge for a guinea; and I found it at Denn's on London-bridge.
Bazil Denn. The prisoner at the bar came to me with a watch.
Q. Are you sure he is the person?
Denn. I don't know whether he is the person, but by his own confession ; and I gave him a guinea for it.
Q. Is that the watch that is produced?
Denn . Yes.
Q. Are you the master of the shop?
Denn . I am the master's son .

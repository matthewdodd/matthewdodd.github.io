JOHN BANNISTER. I live with Lord Bristol. On the 5th of July I was in St. James's-square, about half-past three o'clock - I had been to get change for a 20l. note - and in York-street


 I felt a large key I had in my pocket knock against my thigh - I looked round, and saw the prisoner puting my handkerchief into his hat - there were two other boys, who ran away.

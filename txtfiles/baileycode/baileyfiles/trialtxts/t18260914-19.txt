            . I am clerk to Messrs. William Miller and William Imeson, brewers

, Horsleydown. I was out with their dray, delivering beer, and in Snows-fields I put a shilling's worth of pence and half-pence into the nose-bag, about ten o'clock, and between twelve and one, when I was in Sun-street, Bishopsgate


, I missed seven penny-pieces and five halfpence; the drayman brought the prisoner to me.

            . I am the dray-man. I saw the prisoner take his hand out of the nose-bag in Sun-street; I asked Tomlin if anything was in it; I then ran and caught the prisoner, without losing sight of him; he said he had got nothing but what was his own, but afterwards took seven pence and five halfpence out of his pocket, and said that was what he took from the bag.

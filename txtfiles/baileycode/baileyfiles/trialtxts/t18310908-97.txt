. This piece of handkerchiefs was at my shop door for sale; it was four handkerchiefs in one piece - on the 25th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was looking, and saw them taken; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running off with them - I pursued, calling Stop thief! he dropped them, and was taken, without my losing sight of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. Q. You asked me where they were - if you saw me drop them why not take them up? A. I was anxious to take him; I saw him drop them, and a gentleman gave them to me.

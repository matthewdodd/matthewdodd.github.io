            . On the 25th of October I lost a handkerchief out of my pocket in Fleet-street


; it was soon after given me again by a gentleman on the end of a stick as he took it off the ground. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I was walking along pretty fast; I saw the prisoner pull something out of Mr. Heberdine's pocket; it was dark; I could not see what; I believe a handkerchief; I laid hold of the prisoner, and asked him if he had lost a handkerchief; he felt in his pocket and missed it; the boy offered to be searched but a gentleman picked it off the ground.

I saw nothing of it.

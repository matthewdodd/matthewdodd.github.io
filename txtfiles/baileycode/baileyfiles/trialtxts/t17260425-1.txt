            , of the Parish of St. Dunstans in the West


, was indicted for 


               stealing 6 Guineas and 47 s. the Goods and Money of William Milton, in the Dwelling House of 
                     
                        
                           William

, on the 17th of April
 last.
William Milton thus depos'd. The Prisoner was my Servant
. I left 22 l. in a Drawer in my Parlour, and on Sunday before Easter, I mist 7 l. but did not speak of it to any body, in hopes, that by keeping it secret, I might the sooner discover the Thief. On the Sunday following. I took particular Notice of how much Money was then left, and lock'd it in my Drawer, and lock'd my Parlour Door, and leaving none but the Prisoner at home, I went to Church. When I came back I mist 3 Guineas more, upon which I examin'd her about it, and she at last confest, that 
               
                  Richard 
                  Roberts 
               



            , who she said lodged at the Bull-Head in the Mint, had for sometime past pretended Love to her, that he came to see her in Sermon Time, both the Sunday before, and the Sunday present; that he brought several Picklock-Keys, with which she open'd the Parlour Doors and the Drawers; and that at the first Time, she gave him out of the Purse 4 Guineas, 10 Half-Crowns, and 1 s. And at the second Time 2 Guineas, and 21 s. - After she had made this Confession, she was in a great Agony, and cut her own Throat, and then hang'd herself, but she was prevented from doing either of them effectually. I made enquiry after her Sweetheart, but could hear nothing of him. Her Confession before the Justice was read in Court, and the Jury found her 


               Guilty, to the Value of 39 s.

            , Esq. On the 27th of February I was at Kew-green


, about eight o'clock, putting my horses up to wait for my master, and missed my coat from the carriage. I had seen the prisoner by the carriage just before.
GOODMAN DAVIS. I am shopman to Mr. Saunders, Holywell-street, Strand. About half-past ten o'clock in the morning, on the 27th of February, the prisoner came to sell the coat - he asked four guineas for it; he then offered it to me for 2 l. 15 s. I said I thought it was not his, and asked him how long he had worn it. He said, a long time. He then said,
"give me the coat, and let me be off." I refused. He took me to a house in Water-lane, where he said he was known. I could hear nothing satisfactory, and gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I bought the coat as I was coming up.

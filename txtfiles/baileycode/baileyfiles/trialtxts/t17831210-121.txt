             sworn.
On the 12th of November last, a man came into our shop I had a suspicion of, he asked for some silks, some grave silks, upon asking what they were, he asked for a card of the shop and went out; this woman (Potten) came in very soon after, and asked for some white mode, and Cunningham also came in and asked if that was mode on the counter, I said, it was not, I called the boy, and I went to the glass, and I turned, and saw Mrs. Pottan doubling this under her cloak, I immediately went to look at the parcel, and found a piece was gone, when she saw my master come into the shop she let it fall.
Court. Are you sure it fell from her? - Yes.
Did you see it? - Yes, I heard it fall, and picked it up.
Might it not have fallen off the counter? - No.
Is that your master's sattin? - Yes, I know it by the marks.
PRISONER POTTEN's DEFENCE.
I never saw this woman in my life.
PRISONER CUNNINGHAM's DEFENCE.
I went in to buy a piece of mode, I never touched any thing.

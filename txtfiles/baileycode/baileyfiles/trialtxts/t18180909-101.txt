            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre's. On 1st of July, I saw a crowd of people at Epps's shop on Holborn-bridge, the prosecutor and a gentleman came towards the crowd, the prisoner and another man followed them. The moment Mr. Vickridge came to the crowd and looked in at the window, the prisoner closed behind him, put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a silk handkerchief, put it under his coat, and turned to go away. I collared him and said, "What have you got," he trembled very much, opened his coat, and the handkerchief fell out. I picked it up and alarmed the prosecutor, he claimed it; the prisoner begged of him not to prosecute him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. Q. There was nobody with me - A. There was, I saw that person in Guildhall-yard when the prisoner was examined-and have seen him in the pressyard to day.

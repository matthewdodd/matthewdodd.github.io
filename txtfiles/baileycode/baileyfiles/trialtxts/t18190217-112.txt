            . I am servant to 
               
                  Charles 
                  Warren
               



            , Esq., who lives in Bedford-square


. On the 4th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went into the area, and found one part of the pipe separated from the other, but not taken away - it was bending over the rails in the front area. I went into the dining-room to watch, and in about three minutes I saw a short man by the rails, apparently watching, he beckoned to the prisoner, who came on the steps of the next house, stood on the scraper, which would enable him to reach the pipe; I spoke to him, he jumped off the steps, and ran off - I followed, and secured him in Charlotte-street. I never lost sight of him. The pipe was separated from the house.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I am certain he is the man.

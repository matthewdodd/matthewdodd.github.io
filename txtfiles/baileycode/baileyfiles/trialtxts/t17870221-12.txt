Mrs. BENNET sworn.
I heard the shop door open; I went into the shop, and missed the china; I shut the door and went up stairs, and heard no farther of it till Friday morning, when the constable shewed me the china before the Justice; I swore to them; they are mine.

             sworn.
I saw the prisoner; the things were taken from him in my presence. (Produced.) I asked the prisoner how he came by the things, he said, the same man gave him them that gave him the soap; I took the prisoner at the same time, and have kept the things ever since. (Deposed to.) There is one saucer that is a worse colour than the others.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
As I was coming along Cheapside a lad gave me these things to hold.
Court to Mrs. Bennet. Is your house in the city? - It is.
Do you pay rates to the city? - We do, and no where else.

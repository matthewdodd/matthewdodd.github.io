             sworn. - I am a milkman
: Last Sunday was a week, after doing my business, I put a bag of penny-pieces and halfpence into the cart, in Crown-street, Westminster


; a woman fell down some steps, and I jumped out of the cart to assist her; upon which the prisoner put his foot upon the wheel of the cart, and took out the bag; a little boy told me of it, and I ran after him, but could not catch him; I found him, about an hour afterwards, in his father's bed, undressed, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning; I am sure he is the same boy; I had often seen him before; he had thrown the bag down at a corn-chandler's, and he took me to the place, and shewed me; the woman of the house delivered it to me, and I delivered it to the officer.
Q. Did it appear to you that the woman, who had fell down, had any connection with the prisoner? - A. No.(William Newman, a constable, produced the bag, which was identified by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.

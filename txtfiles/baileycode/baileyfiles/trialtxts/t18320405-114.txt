            ; we live at Brentford


. On the 28th of February I was in the parlour, and heard money rattle; I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner in the shop with the till in his hand - he saw me, then put it down, and ran off, and I after him - I never lost sight of him till Hughes stopped him; he had moved the till about two yards - there was about 5s. 5d. in copper in it.

            . I live near the prosecutrix. I was at my door; I saw the prisoner run out of the prosecutrix's shop, and stopped him; I am quite certain of his person.
Prisoner's Defence. A lady in Gravel-lane had missed her son for a fortnight, and sent me to look for him at Brentford; I heard an alarm, and saw a lad run out of the shop - I immediately pursued, and was taken.

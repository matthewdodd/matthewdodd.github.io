GEORGE GRIMSLADE
. I am bookkeeper at the George Inn, in the Borough. 1 was on Londonbridge, coming from the City on the 24th of

Oct.—I had my pocket handkerchief in my hand when I was in Thames-street, and I put it in my coat pocket behind—I stopped at the foot of Londonbridge to look at a cab that had got jammed in—a person touched me, and said my handkerchief was gone—I turned my head, and saw my handkerchief at the man's feet, and he had both the prisoners in custody at the time.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What time was it? A. About three o'clock in the afternoon—there were no persons about—there was a cab, a van, and an omnibus, all fixed together.





ALFRED AYLES
 (police-constable M 51.) I was on duty that afternoon—I saw Lovelock lift the prosecutor's coat, and take the handkerchief fromhis inside pocket—Brown was standing by, and looking to see if any one was watching, and he stood close to cover Lovelock—I had seen them speaking to one another before.

BROWN—


NOT GUILTY
.

            . I am a widow, and live in Eagle-street, Red Lion-square


. On the 20th of March, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my room, and sat down in a chair. I was going to bed, and said,
"Bill, what brought you here?" He said his mother wanted to speak to me very particularly, and that she was in the infirmary, in the prison. I said I could not go. He looked at me, and said, will you fetch me two-pennyworth of bread and cheese. I told him to go himself - I would not leave the room. My watch was safe over the mantle-piece. I stooped to take up an iron, and the cloth which concealed my watch fell down - I suppose he took it then, as I immediately missed it; he ran down stairs, I called after him, but he never returned. I have not seen it since. It was safe when he came into the room - he must have taken it. He was apprehended on the 1st of August.

            . I live in Edmund-street, Battle-bridge, and work for an upholdster
. On the 7th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was waiting at the corner of George-street, St. Giles's


, for my brother. The prisoner and another girl came up, and asked for drink; they teazed me, and at last I took them into a house, and gave them a glass each - they were strangers. I came out again, and stood waiting there, and did not miss my watch for half anhour - I was sober. I found the prisoner in custody with it, on the 11th.

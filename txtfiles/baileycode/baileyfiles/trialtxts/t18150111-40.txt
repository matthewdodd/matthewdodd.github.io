            . I am foreman to William Evans Everett, he is a grower of linseed
, at Endfield


 he is a farmer
, and the only grower of linseed in that parish. The prisoner was his labourer
. On the 17th of September, I went with the constable and a search warrant to the prisoners lodgings; in his bed room, I found two sacks of linseed, one of the sacks was marked with masters mark.
Q. Had he any business to take the linseed home to his own house - A. No, it was undressed; it ought not to have found its way out of my master's posseson, it was not saleable. I took the sacks and the linseed; the two sacks contained five bushels of linseed; the sacks I delivered to 
               
                  Charles
                  Doe
               



            , the constable, to bring here; these are the sacks, and this is the sort of linseed that master grows; I have no doubt but the sacks and the linseed belongs to my master; it is worth twenty shillings. The prisoner said he brought the linseed home in his shoes.
Prisoner's Defence. I had linseed in my premises which belonged to my master; I used to clean linseed for master, and that is the way it came in my shoes, and one wet night I put a sack over my shoulders to keep me dry as I went home.

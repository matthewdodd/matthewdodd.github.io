 the 18th of February
 last. The prosecutor deposed the prisoners came to his Shop, and that Richardson wanted to see some Buckles, which he shewed him, but he went away without buying any, leaving his Whip, which Green called him to come back for ; but they went away, and he presently mist his Buckles, and followed and overtook them at Milk-Street, where he took them into a Shop, one of the Buckles was dropt at the Shop-door near Richardson, which was swore to by the prosecutor.

             deposed that coming by Milk-Street, and hearing a Noise he went to see what was the matter, that he saw the Buckles dropt , but there being a Crowd he could not be positive that Richardson dropt it, though it lay by him: It appear'd that Richardson was the only person that handled the Buckles , and tho' there were two left only one was found Richardson pleaded that he was drinking with Green at the eg in Newgate-street ; who ask'd him to go with him to a Goldsmiths to buy a pair of Buckles, because he understood the Weight better than himself, Green acknowledg'd the drinking with him, but he deny'd the rest . The Evidence did not affect Green. So he was 

               acquitted
            , and Richardson found 

               Guilty
            .

FREDERICK GOLDEN



, stealing 1 timepiece, value 2l. 8s.; the goods of 



John Batchelor: having been before convicted.






MICHAEL LABEY
 (City policeman, 56). In consequence of information, I went on 4th April to the house of Mr. Booking, in Cambridge-road, Mile-end—I received this timepiece from a female there.





GEORGE SINNOCK
. I am a fruiterer, and live in Cambridge-road, Mile-end. I know Mr. Booking, of Cambridge-road—I saw the prisoner there about a fortnight, three weeks, or a month ago—he was standing at the door, talking—I saw Mr. Booking buy a timepiece of the prisoner, for 10s., in a poblic-house in Three Colt-lane—this is it—I know it by its having no glass in it—it was in the same state as it is now—the prisoner told me he was in distress, and asked me to buy the duplicate of a watch of him—I rather think I bought the duplicate before the timepiece was sold.





MARY BATCHELOR
. I am the wife of John Batchelor, and live at Battersea. On 21st Jan. the prisoner came to my house, and spent the evening—this timepiece is my husband's—I have the piece of glass that was taken from the face of it—I saw the timepiece on the 21st, and missed it next morning.





SAMUEL JENNER
 (police-sergeant H 1). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, at Hastings, by the name of Frederick Jarvis—(read—Convicted, April, 1846; confined nine months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years
.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

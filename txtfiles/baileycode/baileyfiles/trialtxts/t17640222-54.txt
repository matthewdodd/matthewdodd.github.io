                  Logan 
               



            . I came from sea, last November. I took a lodging of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Glass 
               



            , and bought goods of her; (she keeps a broker's shop) which came to about 10 l. and paid her the money, and was to give her half a guinea a week for my fire, candle, victuals, and the use of the room. On the 24th of last January, between four and five in the afternoon, came the two prisoners, and a constable and attorney with them. (Dove was a company-keeper with Mrs. Glass, as far as I understand; sometimes he lived in the house, and sometimes not): Taylor said, all that were in the house, was his property, for he had a bill of sale made to him by Dove. I said, then he had better pay me for my goods: when I first came to the house, I lent Mrs. Glass 20 l. and she gave me some papers, which she had of Capt. Leicester's, at Hull; they were in my chest, in my room, amongst my cloaths; I had also in the chest, a note for 4 l. 8 s. another for 4 l. 4 s. and another for 2 l. 2 s. I had also in the chest two dollars, a pistereen, and seven buttons, all Spanish money; two pair of silver sleeve buttons, and a razor; I saved nothing but what was on my back: I found since, four cheque shirts (which were in the chest when they took possession of all) at a pawnbrokers; they took away also my bed and bedstead, curtains, looking glass, fire-shovel, tongs, stove, and other things: I got a warrant, and took up Taylor, and had a search warrant granted to seach his house; there I found my coat, bed, and chest, but nothing in it; there were three disorderly girls in his house, who were sent to Bridewell; he keeps a very bad house: I found nothing upon Dove. I had been arrested at the suit of Dove, on the 22d of January, for 4 l. 4 s. and I never owed him a half-penny in my life; I never had any thing of him. I regularly paid my half guinea every Saturday, to Mrs. Glass; the other lodgers in the house always paid her. Dove is a labouring-man, at the White-lead-works, Whitechapel: Taylor lives in Buckle-street; he is an officer.
Dove. Logan said, all the goods, and my wife and all, were his; he has taken my wife from me.

Q. to Logan. What name did Mrs. Glass go by?
Logan. Sometimes by the name of Dove, and sometimes Glass. They never lay together, while I was there.


                  James 
                  Bird 
               



            . (He holds a warrant in his hand.) This warrant was delivered to me by Dove or Taylor: they were both together at the time. It is read.
"January 24, 1764.
These are in his Majesty's name, to require and command you, to bring before me the body of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Glass 
               



            , to answer to all such charges that shall be made against her by 
               
                  William 
                  Dove 
               



            , that he goes in danger of his life, &c.
Signed W. Berry."


                  Mary 
                  Glass 
               



             confirmed the prosecutor's evidence.

                  Norris 
               



            , servant to M. Glass, deposed to that of the two prisoners coming and taking possession of the prosecutor's goods, and that Dove knew Logan's room, and that the goods therein were Logan's property.

                  Bird 
               



            . Taylor applied to me to go to keep the peace, and one Simpson, an attorney, went with the two prisoners and I, to Glass's house; Taylor executed a bill of sale there; I saw Dove, by the advice of Taylor, break a room door open, I can't say whose room it was; there was a chest in it: they turned every body out of the house, and Dove gave up the bill of sale to Taylor, and Taylor took possession of all the goods in the house.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Thompson 
               



            . I live in the house of Mrs. Glass; I made two shirts for Mr. Logan: (four shirts produced) two of these are the shirts I made: (deposed to by prosecutor.)
E. Taylor. I saw Mr. Logan lend some money to Mrs. Glass, upon some writings; and saw him pay part of the money due for things he bought of her; he bought a chair, grate, bed, bedstead, curtains, tongs, shovel, and other things. I paid 2 s. a week for my lodgings; I never paid Dove, I always paid Mrs. Glass.
Eadeth Taylor. I lived at Mr. Taylor's house, and was taken out of it as a disorderly woman; I saw several chests brought to his house, on a Thursday, about the 23d or 24th of January; Dove said, one of the chests was Mr. Logan's chest; Mrs. Taylor sent me with four shirts to pawn that are produced here, which I did, to Mr. Beckworth: I saw a green purse, with several pieces of Spanish money, at Taylor's; there was half a dollar, five bits, a pistereen, half a pistereen, and a pair of silver sleeve buttons: I was a sailor's wife, and have been used to know this sort of money.
Humphry Beckworth. I am a pawnbroker. On the 25th of January, I lent the last witness two guineas on some goods; part of which goods were four shirts like these.
Taylor's Defence.
Dove came to me, and said, the prosecutor cohabited with his wife, and he begged I would go and drive him out; so I accepted of this bill of sale. I took a peace officer, and the man that filled the bill of sale, up with me; and Mr. Dove put his hand upon a clock, and said, This I give you, and all above as well as below.
Dove's Defence.
I was married 20 years ago to that woman, (meaning Mrs. Glass) at Edinburgh: I have been in Flanders, in his Majesty's service; and when I came home, we lived together in love, till Logan came to live there: he had her always with him, and neglecting her business. I saw him and her in bed together, and began to be jealous of her: she said I should never lie with her any more, for I had got nothing. I got a warrant for them both; the justice ordered us to go and make it up; after that, I was advised to go and sell all the goods, but I never had a penny of Taylor for them; he and the attorney took upon them to clear me.

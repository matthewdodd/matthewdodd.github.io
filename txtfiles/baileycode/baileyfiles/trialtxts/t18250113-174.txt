            .
WILLIAM WILKINS. I am a tailor
, and live at Fulham


. On the 13th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I heard a person in the front of the shop, while I was at the back of the house - I supposed it might be some one stepping very softly - I went to the door, but saw no one in the street; it struck me that some one had concealed himself close by; I looked at my next neighbour's, which is a linen-draper's; and at the next house, the prisoner was standing up without his hat - I spoke to him, but he would not answer - I asked where he came from; he said from Chelsea - I collared him, and said
"You are the person who has been robbing my shop;" he had got the trowsers and the hat in front of his knees, as he stood before the door.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

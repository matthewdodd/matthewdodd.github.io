            . I am a bricklayer
. I employed the prisoner on the 23rd of July, to wheel a barrow of mortar for me to Mitchell-street


 - I went with him, and took the shovel and a server; I left them there - he and I went to breakfast; when I returned the shovel was gone - the prisoner never came home till night; I had employed him that morning, but not constantly.

            . I am a porter. I have known the prisoner five or six years - he offered me this shovel for 1s., and said he was hungry and thirsty; I let him have the 1s., and left the shovel - I told the landlady if he came for it to let him have it; he came and had it.

            . The prosecutor called on me, and said there was a thief in his house; I went to the prisoner, and asked if he knew any thing about the shovel - he denied it at first, but afterwards said it was at a public-house, in pawn for 1s. - I went and got it.
Prisoner's Defence. I have lodged in the house five years, and was employed that morning to lend the prosecutor a hand; I never took the shovel, and did not know it was taken till a man told me.

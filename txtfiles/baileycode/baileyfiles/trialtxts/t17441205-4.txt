            . I am a watchman. I saw that bar in the range about five minutes before I missed it - About three o'clock last Saturday morning, I saw the Prisoner go off with something in his hand which looked like a bar. I cried out, stop thief, and followed him to the Horse Guards, and heard him throw something down.

            . I was centry at the Pay Office. On Saturday morning last, about half an hour after two, the Prisoner came running along as fast as he could: hearing the watch call out, I stopped him at Scotland-Yard Gate, and kept him till the watchman came up. The Prisoner was charged by the Watchman for stealing an iron bar, but he said he knew nothing of the matter; the bar was drawn out from under the gate, and a hammer was found in the street, a little way off the gate. 


               Guilty 10 d.

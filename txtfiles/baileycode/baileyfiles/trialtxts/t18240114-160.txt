            .
MR. PLATT conducted the prosecution.
HUTTON PERKINS. On the 1st of December, the prisoner Hamilton introduced me to one Schofield, and on the 4th of December he called at my house, and delivered an invoice of these goods to me, and desired me to attend at Lloyd's Coffee-house next day, to see Schofield, that we might enter into security for the amount of the deals; he represented himself as a broker employed by Schofield, and that he had a quantity of deals to sell for him. I went next day to Lloyd's, and saw him and Schofield; Mr. Mitchell came in shortly, and I agreed with Schofield to buy seven hundred and forty-five deals. A bill was to be drawn by Mitchell and accepted by me, for the deals. When that was done, a document of transfer was handed over to Mitchell to endorse; it was then handed over to me. The deals were at the Commercial Docks. I took my leave of Mitchell; and as soon as I got to the end of the street, Hamilton came up to me, and asked if I had got the transfer - I said Yes. He said it would be necessary to lodge it at the Docks that afternoon - I said that there was no occasion, that it would do when I was disposed to have them cleared. He said it was customary in the trade to lodge it with the Dock Company as soon as made out, and when that was done, the goods would be entered in my name. I went to the Docks with him, and lodged it at the clerk's office. The clerk said I must endorse my name on it, which I did, and then left. I wanted the deals to erect some machinery which is now in progress - their value is 156 l.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often has Hamilton dined at your house - A. The fellow has frequently called at my house; he has dined there in the kitchen, never in the parlour.
Q. Never with you - A. I have dined with him in the kitchen. I had known him for about a month before this transaction. He frequently called just as I was going to dinner - I cannot say how often - he may have dined there ten times at my table - he frequently dined with my servants when I was out - he was introduced to me by one Wood. I am a silk-manufacturer, and live in Church-street, Spitalfields; I have just commenced business, and am getting machinery ready.
Q. How much property had you on your premises at the time - A. Perhaps 50 l. worth of silk. Hamilton frequently left catalogues at my house, stating himself to be a broker. He was not my intimate acquaintance, but when he saw my dinner on table, from his shabby appearance, I could do no less than ask him to dine - we never dined in the parlour.
Q. Would your dinner go into the parlour if he had not been there - A. Yes; the servants dined with us. I never dealt in canvas. Hamilton said he knew a man who had some to dispose of - I referred that person to a Mr. Francis, who knew my affairs. I had 9000 l. left me in 1809, and was to come into possession of it in December; but about 350 l. has been advanced upon it - I cannot get it till that is paid.
Q. How were you to pay for the deals - A. By redeeming the papers, by which I could get the 9000 l. - I have friends who would advance money. I did not employ Hamiltonto make purchases for me, and to refer to Francis; I referred to Mitchell about the deals, as he was on 'Change at the time, and it was handy. I applied for some deals which another person had to sell, but bought none I suppose he was not disposed to credit me; I referred him to Mitchell. I never employed Hamilton as a broker; he was not to have a commission from me; he said he got one and a half per cent. from Schofield. I never saw him from the 5th of December till he was apprehended; he called at my house on the evening of the 6th, when I was engaged; I did not see him; he left no message for me; the servant said he called to borrow some money of the servants. I never called on Jury the carman, about moving the deals.
Q. On your oath did you, in the presence of your servant, direct Hamilton to get carts or barges to remove the deals - A. Never. I never said anything about turning them into money. I never paid 
               Hamilton
             any money - I owe him none.
Q. Has he not gone over and over again to persons on your business - A. He stated himself in their employ, and wished to make a sale for them. I found the canvas came into the market illegally, and would not buy it; I wanted it to ship in exchange for silk. I never went to the Custom-house with him. I never saw Booker till he was apprehended.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How old are you - A. Twenty-one. I had commenced business a month before I saw Hamilton. A stock of silk would be useless till I got my machinery up. I never employed him as a broker; he always acted as broker for the opposite party - he applied to me to buy the deals - I never gave him authority to get them from the Docks - all the expenses were paid by Mr. Schofield, the importer. Francis lives in Watling-street, Commercial-road, in a private house - he is now making machines.

                  SIMBREY
               



            . I am out-door clerk at the Commercial Docks. I produce a document of transfer, dated the 5th of September, transferring to Mitchell seven hundred and twenty-five deals. endorsed
"Mitchell" and
"Perkins," as if both are interested in the goods. While I was at dinner Hamilton came to my house, and said he had come for some deals, in the name of Mitchell - that his name was Mitchell, and he wished to get the deals out by that evening's tide. I went to the door, and saw Booker about a hundred yards off. I went down to my office with Hamilton. He asked me two or three times to come and mark the goods off. I went and marked them off. Booker was then by his side, and never left him. Hamilton told me what goods to mark off. I marked off three parcels of deals. Moreland's craft had been waiting in the Docks for them the day before; and two hundred and fifty-six were shipped. I had marked off as many more, but there was not time to ship them. Hamilton followed me into the office - I gave him a note and pass for what were marked; he said he should be down early on Monday morning for the rest - he said his name was Mitchell.
Cross-examined. Q. If the transfer had been presented to you, signed by three persons, would you deliver the goods to that third person - A. If he had represented himself as that third person - no person whose name was not endorsed on the transfer could receive them.


                  JOHN 
                  MORELAND
               



            . I am owner of the craft. On Saturday the 15th of December, these deals were loaded in my craft, by Hamilton's direction; he did not mention any name. I did not see Booker. I took the deals to Lloyd's wharf, by Hamilton's direction.


                  THOMAS 
                  LLOYD
               



            . I have a wharf at Wapping. On the 6th of December, Moreland brought two hundred and fifty-six deals there. Before that, one Hornby had introduced Hamilton to me; he said he had a large quantity of deals, and had I convenience to land them. I asked if they were to go away immediately; he said it depended upon circumstances. I saw him there while they were landing. On Monday we did not finish landing, which he was angry at; and on Tuesday he came; they were all landed on Wednesday, and he brought one Brooford, and sold him a hundred of them; they were delivered on the 10th, to an order signed
"J. Booker" - the one hundred and fifty-six have been delivered to Perkins by the Magistrates' order. Hamilton expected that there was a larger quantity in the barge.

                  MITCHELL
               



            . I was present at Lloyd's Coffee-house when a treaty was made between Schofield and Perkins for these deals; the endorsement on the transfer is my writing. I never authorised either of the prisoners to take the deals into their possession. I never saw them till they were apprehended. I was in company with Schofield and Perkins about ten minutes. I merely guaranteed the payment of the goods for Perkins. I am a surveyor at Lloyd's, and have been so for seven years.
Cross-examined. Q. The bill was drawn by you - A. I signed it as drawer. I have no doubt of Perkins's ability to pay it when due - I have known him twelve months. I think it is drawn at three or four months date. I took a memorandum of it, but have not got it here.
JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. On the night of the 13th of December, Hamilton was brought to the office - I searched him, and found a few halfpence in his pocket, and asked if he had any more money about him - he said
"I have not, so help me God;" but in the calf of his leg I found a bag containing a 5 l. note, twelve sovereigns, and some silver.
Cross-examined. Q. When officers get hold of money. it is difficult to get it back - A. I offered to return it if he could get the Magistrate's leave.

                  MANCE
               



            . I am an officer, and was present when Hamilton was searched. I went to Brooford's premises and found one hundred deals. I went to the wharf and took possession of the rest. I found Booker in custody at the Thames Police, and in consequence of something I heard, I went to him in the New Prison. I told him who I was, and that I had only come from the prosecutor, who he had sent for; that he could say any thing to me, but I could do nothing for him. He said
"I know nothing of the robbery; Hamilton came to me and asked if I knew any body who would purchase some deals; I asked if they were all right; he said they were. I went with him to the Docks, and thought they were all right - he said that all he got above 7 s. each was to be divided between us. I went to Mr. Brooford, who bought one hundred for 42 l. 10 s.; and out of the money I stopped 5 l." I asked if he knew where the remainder of the deals were - he said they must be all at the wharf.

HUTTON PERKINS. The fair price of one hundred deals at that time would be 63 l. 18 s. The bill was at four months' date.
The prisoner Hamilton, in his defence, made an unconnected statement, the substance of which was, that the prosecutor's credit being bad, he had employed him to purchase goods of persons at credit, and sell the same for present cash at any price, in order to raise money to pay the 350 l. to get the documents from the attorney, which entitled him to 9000 l. That he had bought the deals in question, and was employed by the prosecutor to dispose of them.
BOOKER'S Defence. Hamilton called on me to go to the docks with him to meet Perkins, to dispose of the deals, and employed me to sell them.

                  SAVAGE
               



            . I am servant to the prosecutor; he has a woman servant occasionally, she sometimes makes the bed and cooks, and sometimes I do it. I remember when Hamilton first came to the house. My master generally dines in the parlour and I in the kitchen - he sometimes dines in the kitchen with me. Hamilton may have dined there eight or ten times; always in the kitchen. I understood that Hamilton had these deals to sell to my master, as a broker. I never heard my master tell him to dispose of them. They were bought to erect the manufactory. Francis has dined with us five or six times. My master has a maid servant now. I believe the last time that Hamilton called, he asked for my master. I said he was engaged. I told Perkins that he had called and asked for him.
MR. SCHOFIELD. I have seen Hamilton and Perkins together. He never said in what capacity Hamilton was engaged. I never understood him to be Perkins's broker. I sold the deals through my broker to Mr. Mitchell, as I would not trust Perkins, not knowing him.

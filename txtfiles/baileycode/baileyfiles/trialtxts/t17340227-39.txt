Rebecca Morning. Last Saturday Night, between 8 and 9, I sent my Child for a Quartern-loaf. Mrs. Henley's Child being at my House went with her. And Word was brought me the same Night that both the Children had been Stript.

            . While I was at my Brother's, Mr. Robinson came in and said, he believ'd a Woman was stripping a Child under a shed in Finsbury



. We went out with a Light and overtook the Prisoner and the two Children, before they came to Grub-street. I ask'd her where she was going with these Children. She answer'd what's that to you? I enquir'd what she had got in her Apron, she told me nothing of mine. We examin'd her Apron and found the Children's Clothes in it.
Mr. Robinson. Going by the Farrier's shed in Finsbury, I heard a Woman say, damn you you little Bitch, stand still. I mistrusted what she was about, and went to an Ale-house Where Mr. Pye was, and taking a Candle we follow'd the Prisoner, and took her with the Children's Clothes in her Apron. 

               Guilty of both Indictments
            .

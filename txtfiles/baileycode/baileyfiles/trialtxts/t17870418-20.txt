My child was playing in the court where we live, in a dark cotton frock; itwas about two o'clock in the afternoon; she was there not five minutes before; the prisoner was sitting before the court for two hours before the child was taken away; she was first at one end of the court, and then at the other; first at the broad part, then at the little gate; I saw the prisoner several times when I looked out of the window to look for the child; the child is about three years old.

             sworn.
I know the prisoner; on the 27th of March she was about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's; I saw her come by with Mr. Bigg's child in her hand, about ten yards from the court; I asked her where she was going with the child, and she said her mother knew she had got her; I was rather dubious, and came and asked Mrs. Bigg, and she said, Oh, dear, the hussey has got her, that was in the court; she was dressed in a new dark coloured frock.
To Mrs. Bigg. Had you given her leave to take this child? - No, I knew nothing of it.
Did you know the woman before? - No; I had no acquaintance with her; I never saw her after, till she was brought home.

             sworn.
I am father of that child, and husband to that woman; my child had a spotted cotton frock; I have a pattern now in my pocket; on Tuesday, the 27th of March, my little boy came to me, and told me the girl was gone out of the court where I live, which is Hanover-Court, Grub-street; I found the child about three hours after, on the other side of Grub-street; three men were bringing her home, according to a direction which I had written, and which was fixed to her stays, with her name and place of abode, in case she should be lost; her new frock was gone, and her pin-a-fore was put over her stays; on the Sunday following, which was the 1st of April, the child told me she could shew me the way to the naughty woman, and she took me into Moorfields a quarter of a mile, and I found the prisoner with another man's child, and I went home and brought

            , and we found the prisoner; Mrs. Drake said she was the person; I laid hold of her, and asked her, how came you to take my little child? she said, never say so; she positively denied it.
Mrs. Drake. I am quite sure of the prisoner; the frock was never found.

I apprehended the prisoner; she had a child with her.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was coming home last Sunday was a week; I had been to an acquaintance of my mother's; there was another girl about three yards distance from me; she had this man's child in her arms; the man saw a girl run away, and the child began to cry out; I went up to the child, and asked where the child lived; the next day the prosecutor came to me and said, the girl that took my child had a striped bed-gown on; I had never another gown but this.

             Jones, you have been convicted of an offence so peculiarly aggravated, that if it came within any of the descriptions which the law has made punishable with death, you certainly would have no mercy to expect from your sovereign. The taking away children from their parents, and afterwards stripping and robbing them, is so extremely dangerous to society, so destructive to domestic peace and happiness, so dreadful in its consequences to the unhappy infants, and so terrible in its nature to the unfortunate parents, who by that means very frequently irrecoverably lose their children, in a way much worse than death, that it deserves to be punished in theseverest manner. If but a single infant can be saved by the terror of your example, and the punishment you are to undergo, (which will not be much better than that of death) the Court will be happy in discharging its duty. Under these circumstances, the sentence of the Court is, that you, and each of you, be




               Transported for seven years
            .

: one Mr. Gard's chariot put up in my yard on Friday, or Friday se'ennight, between seven and eight in the evening; it is a common thing for gentlemen when they go to Ranelagh to send their chariots, and put them up at my house till they want them again; I had to take the horses from the chariot; it was the outside carriage next the row; it went away between ten and eleven o'clock; a glass was missed between nine and ten.

            , a fellow servant, and I observed a man standing by it on the off side; in about five minutes the prisoner went whistling by through the gate; I suspected him, and followed him a hundred yards; then he stopped and looked about; upon that I insisted upon searching him; upon doing so I found he had a chariot glass, the frame broken off, concealed under his coat. When I came in I went to take care of the horses; the prisoner ran away; I found him twenty minutes after; we never found the glass.

            . The glasses were safe when the chariot came to the inn; I saw it so.

. On the 23d of March my window was broken, and two knives taken out; (looking at two,) I believe them to be mine - I cannot swear to them - I had some like them.

            . I am a cooper, and live in Barbican. On the 23d of March, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner put his hand through the window, and take something out - a person passed, and he went away; then crossed again, and put three of his fingers through the broken glass, and took out another knife - I ran and secured him, took him into the shop, the knives were found in his apron. Another boy was taken, but nothing was found on him.

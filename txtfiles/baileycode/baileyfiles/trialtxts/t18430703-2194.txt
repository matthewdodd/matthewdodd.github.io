THOMAS WEST
. I keep a coffee-house, in Bridge-road, St. Mary, Lambeth. On the 14th of June the prisoner came to lodge at my house—about six o'clock in the evening he went out to go to Astley's theatre—I went out next mornning, and returned about one o'clock—I then missed my watch from the mantel-shelf, where I had left it at a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, when I got up.

Prisoner. I was on the bridge at eight o'clock. Witness. I speak positively to the time, because I had to go to Knightsbridge that morning, and left borne at half-past eight.





MARGARET ANN USHER
. I am waitress at Mr. West's. The prisoner came and had a bed there—I lighted him to bed—he got up about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, and came down—about twelve o'clock I went into my bedroom, and missed three shawls, a searf, a parasol, and an opera-glass, which I had seen safe the night before—I had got up about half-past five o'clock—no one had been is my room after that, till I went up at twelve, and no one had been in the bouse but the prisoner that morning—this is the opera-glass.





JAMES HAYWARD
. I am a policeman. I stopped the prisoner in Providence-row,

on the morning of the 17th of June, took him to the station, searched him, and found this opera-glass—I asked where he got it from—he said he found it one evening, by the Eagle tavern, in the City-road.

Prisoner. I picked it up.

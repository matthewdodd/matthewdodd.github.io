                     Charles 
                     Hughes

                  Robert 
                  Ewin 
               



             depos'd, That he going to a Dinner at Mr. Adamson's, he saw one of his Master's Casks, and not knowing that Mr. Adamson took Beer of his Master, he took occasion to make a particular Enquiry after the Matter, and found, that though he had bought the Beer and paid for it, and it was brought to him by the Prisoners, who had took it from the Brewhouse of Mr. Hughes, in a clandestine Manner. Mr. Adamson depos'd, That he being a Customer to Mr. Hughes for Strong Beer, he order'd his Servants, the Prisoners at the Bar, to bring him some Small, which they did, and that he had received 3 Casks of them in about 6 Weeks; which Beer it appeared they had taken without the Knowledge of Mr. Hughes, or his Clerk Mr. Ewin. They had little to say in their Defence, but accused each other of the Crime, of which the Jury found them both 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d. each
            .

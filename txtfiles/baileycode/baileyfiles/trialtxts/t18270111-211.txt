            . On the 8th of December, I saw the prisoner go into my coffee-room, lean over to a place where there were some glasses - he went out; I missed one, followed, and overtook him in the market - I asked him to step into a house, and asked why he came into my house without having any thing; he said he came to look for a friend - I said I missed a glass; he made no answer; an officer came and found it in his hat.

The prisoner pleaded distress.

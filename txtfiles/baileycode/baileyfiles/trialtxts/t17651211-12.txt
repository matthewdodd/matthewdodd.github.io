            . I am wife to the prosecutor; we keep a little shop
in Chandler-street, Grosvenor square


: on the 22d of October, before 8 in the morning, I was lying in bed, my daughter who is aged about 18, was up alone. (She is lame and cannot well come.) She called to me and said, a woman had been below in our kitchen, and had taken something. I put on part of my things, and ran out; the prisoner began to run, I called stop thief, she was stopped at the bottom of the street, and was brought back with the things mentioned in the indictment. She gave me one handkerchief out of her hand; she owned she was guilty, and hoped I would be favourable to her.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the things.




               Guilty 10 d.

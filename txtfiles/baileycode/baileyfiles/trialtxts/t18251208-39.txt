On the 2d of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was turning into John-street, from the Minories, and saw two men drawing a truck; three persons were behind it, on the pavement, and in Mansel-street I saw the prisoner cross into the road, and bring something from the truck - he turned down Haydon-street; the other two followed him; I secured him in the Minories, with these six shovels on his shoulder; he said they were given to him to carry.(Property produced and sworn to.)

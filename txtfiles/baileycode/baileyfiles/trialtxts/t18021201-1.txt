: On Wednesday, the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and orderd sixpenny-worth of brandy and water; when he had drank it half, he came to the bar and paid for it; he went back, drank the rest, and then ordered another sixpenny-worth; he went out at the door, and came in again; I had a suspicion of him; I watched him, and observed him twice attempt to take down a glass which hung in the parlour; then he took it down, and put it under his great coat; he attempted to go out, I had him stopped, and saw the glass taken from him; he was then taken into custody.
JOHN PAGE sworn. - I was in the bar of the house; an alarm was given by Miss West; I went into the parlour, and took the prisoner; he had the glass buttoned up under his great coat.(David Hughes, a constable, produced the glass).
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was chairman to the Duchess of Somerset; that he went into this house to have a glass of brandy and water; that some boys had made a bonfire; that he got up in the window to look at it, and had the misfortune to knock the glass down, upon which Mr. Page immediately seized him.

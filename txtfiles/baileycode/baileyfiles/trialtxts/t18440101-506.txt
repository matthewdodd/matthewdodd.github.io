CHARLES MOLES
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 ass, price 2l. the property of 




John Hill, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN HILL
. I am horse-keeper at Mr. Burnet's distillery. On the 10th of Nov. the prisoner came to me, and said he understood I had an ass for sale—I said I had, that I did not particularly want to sell it, but if I did I wanted 2l.; for it—he said he had bought a cart and harness, and wanted a good ass to go in it, that the cart was down at Lambeth-walk, and he wanted to get it home—I lent it him on trial to get the cart home—I did not know him before—he referred me to a respectable man, who I knew, as his grandfather—his father was coachman to Mr. Theobald—my son, who is turned eleven, went with him—my son came home without the ass—I saw it again on the 16th of Dec. at the Black Horse, Brixton-road.





THOMAS BAILEY
, cow-keeper, Mitcham, Surrey. On the 11th of Nov. I saw the prisoner with a donkey in a cart, which he was offering for sale to a neighbour of mine—I purchased it of him for a sovereign—the policeman came afterwards, and the prosecutor claimed the donkey.





JOHN LEE
 (police-constable P 80.) I took the prisoner into custody—he refused to tell where the donkey and cart were—I afterwards found it in Bailey's possession—it is the same as the prosecutor has seen.

Prisoner's Defence. My father found it, and told the prosecutor; I was to have the donkey a day or two on trial, and if I liked it, I was to give him 2l.; for it.





WILLIAM REED
 (police-constable V 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at bis trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Justice Erskine.

EDWARD WARREN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of June, 74 yards of ticking, value 8l.; 26 yards of lawn, value 2l. 10s.; and 105 yards of calico, value 3l. 3s.; the goods of 



Francis Barker, his master.






GEORGE GENTIL
. I am foreman to Mr. Francis Barker of Chiswell-street; the prisoner was in his employ. On the 23rd of June, I sent him with a one-horse cart to Messrs. Strutt's, in Wood-street.





AARON BROOKS
. I am porter to Messrs. Strutt of Wood-street. The prisoner came there with a cart on the 23rd of June—I gave him some trusses to put into the cart, and a sheet for Mr. Dixon, containing the articles stated, which were worth about 13l. 14s. 9d., to take to Mr. Dixon's, and I gave him this book to enter it in—I received the book the next morning from another man, but I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody—I have never seen the goods since—this book is not receipted as it ought to have been in the course of business.






THOMAS PRICE
. I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Dixon and Co., of Fenchurch-street. We expected these goods from Messrs. Strutt, but they did not arrive—the prisoner never brought them—I should certainly have known if he had.





JAMES ROBERT GOODSON
 (City police-constable, No. 119.) I took the prisoner on the 3rd of August, in Whitechapel—he said he had lost the property.

Prisoner's Defence. I had other goods in the cart—I went to London-bridge wharf, and delivered two bales there—I had to come up Fish-streethill, and there was a stoppage of carriages—I had to lead my horse, and when I got to Gracechurch-street this parcel was missing—I delivered the rest of the goods I had—I then went home, left the horse and fart, and went about to make inquiry, and again the next morning—I did not tell my master of it—I had property in the cart worth hundreds of pounds.




GUILTY.* Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

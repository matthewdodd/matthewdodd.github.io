             sworn.
I know the prisoner Brindley, I saw him take a knife from Mr. Gibbs's door; I informed Mrs. Gibbs.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. What is it a new knife? - Yes; I was not acquainted with any of its marks.
Mrs. GIBBS sworn.
I live in Smithfield, I lost a knife on the 6th of October.

                   ROBERTS
               



             sworn.
I am a constable, I had an information against Small's house, I went there after ten; I told Mr. Small what I came to look for, which was a chaff knife; he said he had no such things and while I was searching about the shop he ran up three pain of stairs, I ran after him, he went towards the window, he took something off the bench, immediately opened the window, and in the hurry broke two or three panes of glass, and he took the knife longways, and I could see the handle longways; I called, he has thrown it out of the window; I called to Mr. Ashmore.
Mr. Garrow. In what way was you received by the prisoner Small, did he obstruct you in your search? - He did not.
Did not he desire his daughter to open all the places that were locked, and shew you? - I did not hear him.
Will you swear he did not? - He might and I not hear him.


                  PETER
                   ASHMORE
               



             sworn.
I went with Roberts and Mrs. Gibbs, and we had scarcely arrived at Small's door before there was a rattling of glass, and the knife fell down; I picked it up and gave it to the patrol, who marked it immediately on the handle.
Mr. Garrow. Can you venture to say from whence it sell? - No, it is impossible for me to say.
Do you think a knife of this sort could possibly have sell without being injured? - The knife made a great rattling.
Could it fall from any other house? - I do not imagine it could, but if it had it must have gone in an oblique direction, and probably I had been struck with it.

             sworn.
I live in Fleet-lane, I picked it up and marked it, I know it is the same knife.
(The knife deposed to by Mrs. Gibbs.)
Mrs. Gibbs said she knew it by the handle having been loose, and the servant having had hammered it down, and there was the mark at the end.

             sworn.
I am servant to Mrs. Gibbs, I know the knife very well; I unpacked the goods on the morning of the 6th.
PRISONER BRINDLEY's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of it; about nine I was going up Holborn-hill, and these gentlemen came and laid hold of me, I went quietly with them; the lady said she would forgive me if I told her where the knife was, and I said I would go to Fleet-lane and see if I could not find it there.
Court to Copley. Are you sure Brindley is the person? - Yes, I saw him afterwards at the bottom of Chick-lane.
What time was that? - Between nine and ten the same night; when he was taken up he was in a brown coat.

             sworn.
I am daughter to the prisoner; I remember Mr. Ashmore and the others coming to our house about a chaff knife; they took my father into custody.
Did you see the knife at the time they took your father? - No.
Have you seen it now? - No.
Had you been at home in the course of that day? - Yes, there all day, I had been in the shop all day, I am always there; I do not know what a chaff knife is.
Shew her the instrument. - I never saw that before in my life.
Mr. Silvester. How came you to stop the officers from going up stairs? - I did not.
Did not you attempt to stop Mr. Roberts? - No, upon my oath, I was not near the stairs till my father told me to go up stairs, and unlock the door for the gentlemen, I went up first, I never attempted to stop Mr. Roberts from going up stairs.

             sworn.
I was in Fleet-lane about three weeks ago, about the middle of the week, I cannot tell the day; I saw some people round Mr. Small's door, they stopped there for some time; they tell me it was the day that Mr. Small was taken into custody; it was night, I saw a longish instrument; I did not see it come from the window, but I saw by the light of the lamp, the bright part shone, it might be about eight or nine feet high.
The prisoner Small called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.

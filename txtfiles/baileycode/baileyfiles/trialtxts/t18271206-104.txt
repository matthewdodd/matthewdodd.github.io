            . I live with Griffith Foulkes, my father - he is a linen-draper and silk mercer
, in Little Russel-street, Covent-garden


. On the 1st of December, in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop between nine and ten o'clock - I had often suspected her of taking ribbons; she asked for black ribbons - I set the drawer before her - my attention was taken off by another person. I suspected by the prisoner's manner, that she had taken something; I turned round to her; she desired me to cut a yard off, which I did - I wrapped it in paper and gave it to her; she put down 1s., which I took to the desk and got change; I took it to her, then told her I suspected she had taken some ribbon, and desired her to come to the end of the shop; I asked if she would let me look under her shawl, and there I found this half piece of ribbon - it has my writing on it.(Property produced and sworn to.)

             sworn.
I was sent of an errand to New-street, by Mr. Bell, on the 3d of November, between six and seven o'clock at night; I met the prisoner with the rope and chain; as soon as he saw me he dropped the rope and chain, and ran away; I pursued him and took him, and the rope and chain in New-street; and it appeared to be my master's rope and chain.
How did you know it? - I knew it bythe chain; it has had a ring put to it since the chain was made.
WILLIAM WHITEHEAD sworn.

- BOX sworn.
I have had the rope and chain in my possession ever since.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I saw the rope lay on the ground, and I picked it up; I did not know the use of it.

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of March, between five and six o'clock in the morning, before daylight, I stopped the prisoner coming up Petticoat-lane with a basket on his head. I asked him what he had got in the basket? he said it was linen. I asked him where he brought it from? he said from No. 22, Finsbury-square, and was going to take it to the West India Docks, and that the captain of a ship gave it to him. I asked him if he had any bill? he said No. I called Stone to my assistance, and told the prisoner he had a glass and a basket, and said he must go to the watch-house. He said if he must go to the watch-house we might carry the basket ourselves; Stone carried the basket, and I took the prisoner - he went quietly to the watch-house. He put his hand to his pocket, and dropped something behind him, which appeared to me to be white, as if it was candle. The basket contained twelve bottles of wine, and was covered with brown Holland; some toe kept the bottles from breaking. On the prisoner's person was found a small hand crow-bar, a large clasp knife, three books, one was a slate book, a memorandum book, and a hymn book, with
"Hoxton Accademy" printed in it. He had a hat in his hand, which he said he bought in Rosemary-lane for 4 s. 6 d. Mr. Colley claimed it.

            . I remember Hughes calling me - he had the prisoner in custody with the basket; we took him to the watch-house. He said he was going on board the Levant, and that he bought the hat in Rosemary-lane.

            . I am a watchman. On the morning the prisoner was apprehended I picked up a piece of wax candle in Petticoat-lane, and a few minutes after, I picked up three more pieces. I shewed Hughes where I picked them up.

             re-examined. It is the spot where I saw him throw something down.
CHARLES CLAPHAM. I am keeper of the City-road chapel


















. The property was entrusted to my care - the articles produced are all the property of the chapel; every thing was safe about ten o'clock on Friday night, the 3d of March. Next morning, about six o'clock, I found every thing gone - the black cloth that hung round the gallery was stolen; that has not been found.

            . I am a headborough. I found a crowbar in the prisoner's breeches pocket, and three books inhis waistcoat pocket. I compared the bar with two or three places at the chapel that had been broken open. The impression in the wood exactly fit the crow-bar. The wine-cellar in the chapel had been forced open. The knife found on the prisoner fitted it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was hired by a captain, who met me in the City-road, to carry them to the London Docks.

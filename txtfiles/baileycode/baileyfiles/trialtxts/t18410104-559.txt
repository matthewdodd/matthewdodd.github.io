ISAAC DAY
. I keep a beer-shop in the Greenwich-road. On the 23rd of December I had some goods brought from London, and employed the prisoner to assist me in unpacking them—I afterwards missed all the articles stated—a spoon and a towel are here—these are part of what I lost.

Prisoner. Q. Was there any other person employed to take the things out? A. No, only the man who moved the goods down—you were up in the room.

Prisoner. That spoon and towel belong to the landlord of the North Pole public-house. Witness. I swear to them, and here is the fellow-towel to this one—they are marked "G."





ALICE READING
. I keep a lodging-house. The prisoner sold this towel and spoon to me, on Monday evening, the 28th of December—he asked the price of a pint of beer for them, which is 2d., and I gave it him—I then found the spoon was silver—I got an officer, and gave him in charge.

Prisoner. In August, 1839, I was in Calcutta; I went raving mad, and was in the mad-house there; I was brought home to the London Dock in July last, and was given to the Thames police; I escaped, and got on board various ships, to try to get service; I was at the North Pole public-house, and this derangement came over me; I took this spoon and towel, and a knife, from there, on the Monday night.





JOHN WALKER
 (police-constable R 182.) I took the prisoner—he said he had these things from his wife—he was remanded, and I made inquiries at the North Pole public-house—I have known the prisoner from a boy—he has not been deranged, to my knowledge—he has deserted twice from the army.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.

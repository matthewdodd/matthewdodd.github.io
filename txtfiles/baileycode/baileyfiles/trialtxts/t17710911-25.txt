; I live in the New Road, Whitechapel


; I lost the tools mentioned in the indictment, and my frock cut of my shop; about three weeks after I met the prisoner with my frock on his back; I stopt him, and accused him of stealing my frock; he said he had had it three years (the frock produced and swere to by the prosecutor.)

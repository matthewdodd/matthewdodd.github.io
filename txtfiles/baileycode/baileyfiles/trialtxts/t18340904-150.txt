            . I am an officer. I fell in with the prisoner, on the 30th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, in Rosemary-lane, with a lamp-stand and a book in her hand - I asked her what she had got - she said it was something sent to her from the country, by her aunt- I took her into custody - she was about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.
DACRE WILLIAM THRELKELD. I live in Wood-street, Cheapside


. I missed this property the day the prisoner was stopped with it - it was taken from my second floor - I do not know the prisoner - I did not see her near the house - the latch of our door is always tied back, as we have offices on the first floor.

            . Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the 30th of August, I took off the top of the lamp, to get a glass for it, leaving the stand on a cheffonier, between the parlour, on the second floor; and when I returned with the glass, the stand was gone - that was at three o'clock.
Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of buying little things in Petticoat-lane, and gave 19s. 6d. for these - if I had known they were stolen, I would not have received them- I had them open in my hand - I buy wearing apparel.

, and called for a Tiff of Punch, (it being a publick House,) but after staying there some time, not very well liking the Place, called to pay the Reckoning, I pull'd out my Purse, and paid it: The Prisoner came to me, and kissed me, and picked my Pocket of the Money laid in the Indictment; I had a Moidore, which I had taken in Trade, that was something dubious, and asked them to change it, but they could not, so paid them in other Money - I had my Money not two Minutes before the Prisoner came and kiss'd me, and she was but just got out of the Room before I miss'd it.

The Prisoner said, that they offer'd her to make it up for Ten Guineas; but she refus'd , and deny'd the Fact.

They are the King's, here is the broad R upon them; that the Prisoner bringing him the two last, he suspecting him before, had refus'd to pay him, till he brought sufficient Witness how he came by them, and he coming to demand his Money, or the Weights, he seiz'd him, and sent word to the Custom-House, to Mr. Parsons, who own'd them to be the King's Weights, as he also depos'd in Court; the Fact being plain, the Jury found the Prisoner 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

                  Young

            .
Mrs. Brooks confirm'd the Evidence of Mrs de Voe, and swore, the Petticoat that she had lost, and was taken in the Prisoner's Possession, to be her Petticoat.

That the Prisoner pretending she did not think it so late, did hasten the Dinner ; that the Time she went thither was about 12 o' Clock, and that she staid while the Ladies came Home, which was about One. Being ask'd if she saw any Body in the House besides the Prisoner, or heard the Street Door go? She reply'd, she did not hear any thing that should give her Reason to think that any body went out while she was there.
Edwa rd Season depos'd, That he knowing the Prisoner, and having heard that she had robbed the Prosecutor, and likewise heard that 
               
                  John

The Fact being prov'd to the Satisfaction of the Jury, they found the Prisoner 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

                  Shillingford 
               



             depos'd, That as he was going over Stepney Fields about Three o'Clock in the Morning, he saw the Prisoners carrying Sauce Pans, and perceiving Hawkswell's Pockets bulk out, he suspecting them to have committed some Robbery, therefore ask'd Hawkswell (the old Man) where he had the Goods, and whither he was carrying them? That he reply'd, He was in fear that his Landlord would seize them for Rent, and so he had come from his Lodgings; that he searching his Pockets, found wet Linen, which further confirming his Suspicion, he would not let them go from him, till he came to White-Chapel, and got a Constable, and secur'd them, except one Boy, which ran away; and having got it out of the other Boy, that they had brought the Things from New Gravel-Lane , the Boy pretending, that as they were going to get Bird's Nests, the Prisoner met them, and desired them to carry the Things for him; he went thither, and upon inquiry found the Prosecutors; and in coming over an Hay-Field, found the Boy which had run from him, lying in a Hay-cock, who carried him to the Farthing-Pye-Fields , and shew'd him where they had hid a Porridge Pot in a Ditch.
Hawkswell in his Defence pleaded, That he being out late on Saturday Night, met a Man, who desir'd him to help him to carry some Goods for him out of his House; but produc'd no such Person.
Willington pleaded, That they were going a Bird's Nesting, and met with Hawkswell, and he was to give him a Half-penny to carry the Things for him. There was no Evidence against Fleming, but his being with the other, nothing being found upon him, and also that he could discover where the Porridge Pot was hid in the Ditch; and Willington calling some Evidences, who gave him a good Character, the Jury 

               acquitted
             both him and Fleming, and found Hawkswell alone 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d. upon each Indictment

                  William 
                  Cushnee 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner was his Lodger, and he having come lately from Scotland, and having three Guineas and a half, desir'd his Wife to lay it up for him, and give it him as he had occasion for it, and had had a Guinea and a half of the Money at times as he wanted it; that the last Money he wanted, he went himself to give it him, it was in the Prisoner's own Pocket Book, which was laid in the Drawer of a Trunk, in which lay the eighteen Guineas and a half scatter'd about in the Drawer, which the Prisoner standing by, and looking over his Shoulder, had an opportunity of seeing; that this was about eight Days before the Money was lost; that the Prisoner having a Watch, and having broken the Chain, wanting Money, desired him to sell it for him, which he refusing, the Prisoner pawn'd it for 15 s. as was proved in Court by the Pawnbroker.
This Evidence was confirm'd by the Prosecutor's Wife, 
               
                  Anne 
                  Cushnee 
               



            , who depos'd, That the Prisoner having desired her to lay up in his Pocket Book three Guineas and a half, he having no Conveniency to lay it in, and not caring to carry it about him, that she did so, and the next Week he desir'd to have half a Guinea of it, and about ten Days after that he desir'd to have another Guinea, which she gave him, and soon after ask'd for his Pocket Book, and the other two Guineas, which was given him, as her Husband had before depos'd. That on Sunday, the 21st of June, the Prisoner came into her Room, and sate there Reading, that she telling him, it was time to go to Church, that the Bells had rung in, he went, but came back again in less than half an Hour; that she asking him, why he came back so soon? He said, the Prayers were ended, and he was weary of standing; that she not knowing how to get him out of the Room, and wanting to shift herself, was oblig'd to go down into a Neighbour's Room to do it; that while she was out of the Room, the Key of that Drawer in which the Money was, hung with other Keys in the upper Part of the Trunk, the Prisoner sitting by the Trunk reading, that she suspecting nothing, never look'd for her Money till the Wednesday following; that then she being washing, the Prisoner desir'd to have his Linen wash'd, saying, he was to go into the Country; she knew not by what foreboding of Mind, ran up in some surprize to look for her Money, and having taken the Keys out of her Trunk some Days before, and thrown them among some Clothes into a Basket, open'd the Drawer, and found that all her Money was gone; upon which knowing that no Body had been alone in her Room but the Prisoner, she complained before the Prisoner of her Money being lost; and she observing that the Prisoner took little Notice of it, there being no other Person for her to suspect but the Prisoner, she charg'd him with it; but he deny'd it, she got an Officer, and would have him consent to be search'd, but he said he would not be search'd but before higher Powers; whereupon he was carried before the Justice, and being search'd, in his Pocket Book were found twenty Guineas and a half; that before she saw the Money, there were among her Guineas two that she had taken particular Notice of, and if at any time she took out Money, she always took Care to look over them, and lay them by, resolving not to part with them while she had any other left; that they both of them had a Pig (as she call'd it, i. e. an Elephant) under the Head, one of them was a very fair new Guinea, and the other an old one, that had been a little defac'd or worn; that upon looking over the Money, there were two such Guineas there, which she swore positively to be two of those she had lost; and the same she swore in Court, they being produc'd and shewn to her.
Justice Webster depos'd, That she did before him describe one, or both, of the Guineas before ever she saw them.
The Prisoner began his Defence with a florid Harangue, That it was some Alleviation to the Greatness of his Misfortune, that tho' he was a Stranger in the Country, distant from his Friends, he had the Happiness to stand and vindicate his Innocence before so honourable a Court, the Fame of whose Justice and Impartiality he had so often heard. That as to the Fact he was charg'd with, he was intirely Innocent; that he descended of a reputable Family, had the Happiness of having had a Gentleman-like , learned, and virtuous Education; had commence Master of Arts in the University of A ; was capable of taking his Trial in Latin or Greek ; was always train'd and educated in 
               
                  Christian 
                  Principles 
               



            , and his Mind embellish'd with such noble Notions of Vertue, that it was not probable, may, possible, he could be Guilty of so base a Fact as he stood charg'd with; that he had serv'd several Years in the Excise in Scotland, had good Recommendations thence to London; that he had indeed married unhappily, and for that Reason came to London in Expectation of some Advancement; and that he brought Money with him from Scotland, and could prove he had more Money than the three Guineas and a half, but being a Stranger, kept it conceal'd, being sew'd up in his Fob. And in Proof of this, call'd

The Prisoner intimated, that the Prosecutor was but a Journeyman Taylor, and his Wife a Washerwoman, and that it was unlikely that he should have so much as eighteen Guineas and a half, and call'd some Witnesses who had heard the Prosecutor's Wife complain for want of Money.
To this the Prosecutor and his Wife reply'd, That upon Occasion of some Words between him and his Wife, the Prisoner took upon him to say, what need have you to complain, you have Gold enough.
But the Prosecutor call'd others who establish'd his Character as to that; and that he and his Wife were honest, saving, and industrious People, and did generally pass in the Neighbourhood for Persons aforehand in the World.
The Prisoner likewise call'd some Persons to his Character, but their Acquaintance with him was but of short Continuance; and the Fact being plainly proved, the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

            , the 21st of December
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prosecutor having stripp'd himself to Fight, afterwards went into a Brandy-Shop, to wash and dress himself, and while he was dressing, the Prisoner snatch'd up the Clothes, handed them out to a Woman, and ran away, but being pursued, was taken.
The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and said, That one 
               
                  Patrick
                   Gill, alias 
Black Patty




            , in Newgate, indicted for another Felony, own'd, that himself committed the Fact, and call'd 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Johnson 
               



             to prove it, who depos'd, That he being a Coachman, was standing near the place, and saw 
               
                  Patrick 
                  Gill 
               



             run along with them, and being call'd by a Fare, set them down at the next Door to the House where Gill had pawn'd them, as Gill told him, he seeing him there; but this extraordinary Evidence, not seeming probable, did not avail him, and the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d
            .

He being ask'd, if there was no Body in the Room but himself and the Prisoner? reply'd, Yes; his Friend and another Woman, but they were sitting in a Chair, and did never come nigh him.

The Prosecutor depos'd, That about Nine o'Clock at Night, the Day laid in the Indictment, as he was going along Cornhill, he was met by the Prisoner, who ask'd him to give her a Glass of Wine; that she carried him to a Tavern in Bishopsgate-street


, and her Maid followed them in, that they had two or three Pints of Wine, and the Drawer was going to and fro, and she and her Maid were busy about his Breeches, and he began to suspect them, and was for going away, but the Prisoner persuaded him to stay, telling him, she liv'd near him; that he chang'd a Guinea to pay the Reckoning, and had the Change in Silver in his Pocket; that as they were going along from the Tavern, and going Home, he fell down, or she fell'd him down, he could not well tell which, and dirted his Cloaths, and broke his Sword, and that there the Prisoner took 8 or 9 s. out of his Pocket; that he was conducted to the Prisoner's House, and was afterwards turned out of Doors into the Street, and taken up by the Watch, being very much in Liquor, and did believe that they had put something in it to make him so, but he did not miss his Money till he had been some time in the Watch-House.

That she reply'd, No, he was her Husband; but he took Notice that she minded more the picking up the Money than to take care of her Husband, who was then lying in the Dirt; that he help'd the Prosecutor up, and assisted in leading him on one side, but he got his Arm loose, and giving a back stroke, struck him on the Chin, he perceiving that they did not care for his Company , left them to themselves; and Mr. Goodyer coming up, he suspecting the Prisoner, told him, that he believ'd the Gentleman was got into ill Hands, and so they agreed to follow them, and see the Event, and saw them go into the Court, and into the Prisoner's House, that they listened a little while , and heard some grumbling and muttering, but no distinct Words, and went and enquired the Character of the House, and finding it not to be very good, they went to the Watch-House at Aldgate, and gave Notice to the Constable.

            , the Constable, depos'd, That about Eleven o'Clock, the two former Evidences came to the Watch-House, and gave him an Account of what they had seen, and desired him to take care of the House; that he immediately went with some of his Watchmen, and there found the Prosecutor lying, his Legs extended, so that if a Coach had come down Crutched-Fryars , it would have ran over them, his Sword broke under him, his Breeches down, his Back-side on the bare Ground, whether he had fouled himself or not he would not say, but he was in a dismal Condition; that he got him carried to the Watch-House, but he was so dead Drunk, that there was no putting up his Breeches, nor could he stand or speak for two or three Hours; that he order'd 4 Watchmen to guard the House, and not to suffer any Body to go either out or in; that when the Prosecutor came to himself, he said, he was robb'd and undone . That the next Morning one of the Watchmen came, and told him, the Window was open, so he went and secur'd the Prisoner, and her Maid, the Maid being about making a Fire, and the Prisoner above Stairs dressing herself; that he telling her that she was his Prisoner, and must go before the Justice, she said she would not go without a Coach; he then ask'd her, If she had any Money to pay for it? she said, Yes, she had two Guineas, and that was all the Money she had in the World, and pulled out a Pistole, and gave him, saying, there is a Guinea, do you pay for the Coach, and give me the Change; that he looking upon it, said, Madam, this is not a Guinea, it is a Pistole, that the Prosecutor said presently, I had but one Pistole in my Money, and looking upon it, said, this is my Pistole, it is mark'd, and I know it by that to be mine. That she deny'd the having the Prosecutor's Money still, he thereupon got a Coach, lock'd up the Door, and carried her and her Maid to go before the Lord Mayor; but going to the Swan Tavern to wait while they could know that the Lord Mayor was at leisure, there she desired to have some Talk with the Prosecutor, and after that, said, well, if you say so, my Maid shall go with you, and you shall have all your Things; that thereupon he took Coach, went back with the Maid and some other Persons to the House, and she taking up a Case-Knife, went up Stairs, ript the Feather-Bed about a Foot in length, and feeling among the Feathers, pulled out a Clout, in which was 45 Guineas, and then going down into the Cellar, took the Watch and Snuff-Box from out of some Rubbish; after which going back to the Tavern, the Captain upon telling the Money, said, there was 46 Guineas in his Purse, and now there wanted a Guinea, upon which the Prisoner put her Hand in her Pocket, and gave him a Guinea.
Most of these Circumstances were confirmed by other Evidences.

                  Man 
               



             depos'd, That she dwelling in Crutched-Fryars , over-against the Prisoner's House, Mr. Broadhurst and Goodyer knock'd and enquired the Character of the Prisoner's House, that she told them it had but an indifferent Character, though she had liv'd there but about three Weeks; that they desired her to observe if any Body went in or out, and she look'd through a Chink, and saw a tall Woman, which she believes to be the Prisoner, and a short Woman, which she takes to be her Maid, lug the Prosecutor out of the Court, and lay him directly over-against their Door, and the tall one took the Gentleman's Head and gave it a knock against the Door, and he cry'd, Damn her for a Bitch; being ask'd, what Colour her Gown was? she said, She took it to be Red and White. Mr. Broadhurst said, when she pick'd up the Gentleman, she had a Blue Gown, and a Scarlet Cloak, and Silver trimming, and Bobs in her Ears, but he believed she might change her Cloaths before she came out with the Prosecutor.

            , alias Nowland, was apprehended (for offering to sell some Goods that were stolen from Mr. Northook) and committed to our Goal. And hoping to be made an Evidence, she gave me Information of the Prisoners. 'Go, says she, to the Three Cranes ' in Castle-Lane , Westminster, and enquire ' where Mrs. Ram lives, Paternoster and Darvan ' lodge up one pair of Stairs in her ' House. If you don't find 'em there, go to ' the Horse-shoe behind Green's Free-school, and ' if you miss of 'em there too, desire the People ' of the House to tell you where Mr. ' Morris the Shoe-maker lives, for they often ' meet at his House. Paternoster is a young ' Man with a bald Head, he wears a fair ' Wig, an out-side light Drab Coat, with a ' great Cape, his under Clothes are Snuff-colour, ' and sometimes blue Grey turn'd up ' with Black, a Silver Watch with a Crimson ' String. Darvan is a young Lad near 19 ' Years of Age, pretty well set, wears a light ' Wig, a new Hat with a Silver Loop and ' Button, a blue grey Coat, and a work'd ' Waistcoat; and sometimes an olive-colour'd ' Suit. Each of 'em wears a small Diamond-Ring.' I took these Directions in Writing, and went to the Three Cranes in Castle Lane. Mr. Cook , who keeps that House, is a Constable. I took him and 
               
                  James 
                  Ogilby 
               



             with me, and went to Mrs. Ram's in the Morning, and asking her if her Lodgers were within, went directly up Stairs, push'd open the Chamber-Door, and found 'em in Bed. We secur'd 'em, and then search'd the Room. Their Hats, Wigs, Clothes, Watches and Rings, and their Persons, answer'd Callicant's Description; and yet with horrible Oaths and Imprecations they protected at first that they never knew nor heard of such a Woman as Callicant; but afterwards confess'd that they were acquainted with her. In the Drawers we found these 7 Holland Waistcoats, mark'd G R, with a Crown at top. One of the Crowns is partly pick'd out; above 20 Pair of Stockings, Mens and Womens, Silk, Thread and Worsted; some Womens Linen, and several other Sorts of Goods. I examin'd how they came by them. They said they bought the Mens Apparel for their own wearing, and the Womens Clothes were their Wives.

                  Cook 
               



            , Constable. I saw the same Goods taken in the Prisoner's Room, and among them these Wires roll'd up thus. They are about 3 or 4 Foot long, when pull'd out, and there's a Hook at one End. They seem very proper to draw Goods out at a Window when they lie too far within a Room to be reach'd by the Hand only.


                  James 
                  Ogilby 
               



            . I saw the same Things found in the Prisoners Possession.


                  Mary 
                  Ram 
               



            . I live in Castle-Lane, (some call it Cabbage-Lane) in Westminster. The Prisoners were my Lodgers; they were recommended to me by Mr. Morris the Shoe-maker, who said they were Gentlemen's Sons, and had 700 l. left 'em by their Godmothers. They kept pretty good Hours. But one Night they came home about 6, went up with a Candle, lock'd the Door, staid about half an Hour, went out again with the Key, and return'd between 2 and 3 in the Morning. I was a Bed when they came, and they wanted to light a Candle, but I huff'd 'em for staying out so late, and so they went to Bed in the dark. I ask'd 'em one day what they did with those Wives , and they said they went a fishing with them .


                  Prisoner, J.


             Darvan. We don't deny that the Goods were found in our Room, but that we brought 'em there. Mrs. Ram could open the Door without our Key. I came home one Night about 9 a Clock, and found the Room washed. I asked her how she got in when we had the Key? She said she open'd the Door with her own Key.


                  Mary 
                  Ram 
               



            . That was only once, when they had lost the Key, and order'd me to get another. I never was in the Room by my self, at any other time.
Prisoners. Did we deny you the Key?


                  Mary 
                  Ram 
               



            . No.
The Jury found them 


               guilty to the value of 39 s.

            . The Goods were left in the Kitchin Window in Mrs. Lingard's House. A Pane of Glass was taken out of the Window, and the Goods carried off, and I advertiz'd 'em, and Mr. Cook, the Constable, brought 'em to me.

            . As we were searching the Prisoners Room (of which I gave some Account in the last Trial) I saw Paternoster have some wet Linen in his Hand, which he went to hide behind the Table. Who does that belong to? says I. Why, to my Wife, says he; these are her Headclothes. Your Wife! says I, (and took 'em from him) does your Wife wear such Linen as this? - This is the same Linen; here's 14 Pieces of 'em.

            , Constable. On reading the Advertisement I carried this Linen to Mrs. Sheppard, who own'd it. Among other Things, I found this Diamond Pen in the Room. I suppose it is to cut Glass.
Paternoster. I was never married, and therefore could not say that the Linen was my Wife's.

Prisoners. 'Tis no such thing. When we were apprehended, they took all our Clothes and Watches from us, which we can prove we bought, and honestly paid for, and therefore we hope we shall have 'em return'd to us.

Mr. Chapel. I took a Place in the Oxford Coach at Uxbridge , and gave a Portmanteau to the Coachman, who put it behind. About Hillington , Mr. Lutwych look'd out of the Coach, and said, There's the One-ey'd Boy that has follow'd the Coach from Oxford. I think I have seen him try'd at Oxford. The Boy still follow'd , and coming into Town he got up behind. I look'd out several times, and saw him and the Portmanteau behind the Coach, but in Bondstreet I saw him running with the Portmanteau under his Arm. I call'd after him, bade the Coachman stop, and got out to pursue him, but he gave me the slip. On Thursday Night last he was taken in Lincolns-Inn Play-house, in attempting to pick the Pocket of Mr. Bulgress. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him

I ask'd if he was Dead, he said, no, he guggled in the Throat ; and how, says I, could you leave your Fellow-Dumb-Creature in that Condition ? He made no answer to that, but said he found the Purse 2 or 3 Yards from the Deceased; and taking out the Money, threw the Purse on the Dunghill; I went with him to the Dunghill , and found it.
Prisoner. As I was coming from Stanmore towards London, I found the Deceased lying in the Road, I thought he was only Drunk, but raising him up, I found he was Dead, and going a few Yards further, I kick'd a Purse before me; I took it up, and emptied it, and then threw it on the Dunghill; the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

            , on the 8th of this Instant January

.
Mr. De Boyville. Last Monday Seven-night the Lead of my Son's Coffin was taken from the Vault in Bow Church



. He was Buried there in the Year 1721. I bought the Coffin of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Reynolds 
               



            , the Undertaker.
Mr. Reynolds . The Prosecutor bought the Coffin of me. I saw it sodder'd up, and the Body of his Son was then within it. And afterwards I attended the Funeral, and saw the same Coffin put into Bow Church Vault in February 1721.


                  Francis 
                  Warner 
               



            . Last Monday Sev'n-night, between Four and Five in the Morning, the Prisoner came to me with this Mallet and Chissel, and we went together into Bow Church Vault, and there he cut the Lead and Plate off of Mr. Boyville's Son's Coffin. I knew it to be his Coffin, because there was an Inscription upon it. I help'd him to carry the Lead to Mr. Moore in King-street, in Old-Street-Square , who gave us at the Rate of 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it. The Prisoner was under Grave-Digger
 of Aldgate, and I am sometimes 'employ'd as a Bearer, by Mr. Robinson, the Sexton, of Bow Church. The Prisoner got the Key of the Vault of Mr. Robinson's Maid Mary, who will let him have it at any time, because he gives her now and then a Penny, or two Pence.


                  Robert 
                  Moore 
               



             . I bought the Lead of the Prisoner about Eight o'Clock last Monday Morning was Seven-night . There was a Hundred and three Quarters all cut to Pieces. I ask'd him how he came by it? he said, that he was employ'd in clearing the Vaults at Aldgate Church, and the Church Wardens gave him leave to take it as a Perquisite, and make the best on't.
Prisoner. You said, bring what ye will, and I'll buy it of ye. I have often sold you Coffin Handles; but as for the Lead, was it I or Warner that brought it to you?
Moore. Warner was with you, but it was you that deliver'd the Lead to me, and took the Money.


                  John 
                  Newton 
               



             . On the same Day Mr. Williamson brought three Hundred and a half of Lead to me, and I bought it of him at 13 s. a Hundred. One of my Men said, this Lead smells so strong of dead Corps that it almost choaks me. Phoo! says I, that's only your fancy! But in two or three Days having occasion to melt some of it, I found this Piece among it, with this Inscription:
Mr. 
               
                  Rene
                   De Boyville Obijt
               



             Jan. 29th 1721. in the 16th Year of his Age. Upon which I went to Mr. Boyville and inform'd him of it.


                  Seth 
                  Williamson 
               



             . I keep an Old-Iron Shop in Chissel-street . Mr. Moore came to me for some Iron to make Coffin Handles, and said he had some Lead to sell. I bought upwards of 300 Weight of him at 11 s. a Hundred, which I sold to Mr. Newton at 13 s. a Hundred. I asked Moore, who he bought it of? He said of some Grave-Diggers who had it for Perquisites.
Prisoner. Warner told me that he had Orders from Mr. Prior, the Church-Warden of Bow Church, to clear the Vault. And when I went down with him, he said, This is a good Place, my other Perquisites are but small, and when these Things [Iron, Lead and Nails] are gone, my Business will be worth nothing.
Warner . A little while ago the Sexton gave me leave to go down and level the Floor of the Vault. The Prisoner went with me, and taking one of the Candles he look'd all round the Vault. Lord! says he, What a Sight of Brass Nails and Handles here is? What a pity it is they should lie and spoil here, when I can have 2 d. a Pound for the worst Handle among them?
Prisoner. There's Mr. Hall, the Common-Council Man, knows me, and can give me a Character.
Mr. Hall. I know he has been Under-Grave-Digger in Aldgate Parish for four or five Years. We have had some suspicion of him, - and Yesterday we searched the South-Vault of the Church, and found it all robb'd, - and Nobody had the Key but him and his Master, and his Master hears a very honest Character.


                  John 
                  Maxey 
               



            . I have known Warner come to the Prisoner before Five in the Morning, and say, Come Tom, I have got the Key, the Church-Warden has given me leave to rummage the Vault.
Warner . I never said any such thing, nor ever had such Orders given me by the Church-Warden.
Second Indictment.


                  Nathaniel 
                  Garland 
               



            . About the 30th of March 1726, my Brother was Buried in Bow Church Vault



. I was Administrator, and order'd Mr. 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Roome 
               



             , Undertaker in Fleet-street, to make a Wooden and a Leaden Coffin, but I did not see the Corps put in.


                  John 
                  Paine 
               



             . I saw the Deceased put into the Coffin, and afterwards Interr'd in the Vault; and hearing last Saturday that the Vault had been robb'd, I enquir'd after Mr. Garland's Coffin. Warner told me, the Coffin was taken quite away, and the Corps thrown on the Ground, and shew'd me the place where it lay. I knew the Body by two Things; the Deceas'd had been Lame, and one of his Legs was shorter than the other; and after his Death his Body was open'd for the Satisfaction of his Friends to know what Distemper he dy'd of.
Warner . Last Saturday Morning between 4 and 5 the Prisoner went into the Vault with this Mallet and Chissel . He broke the Wooden Coffin, and then cut the Sides of the Leaden one, and tumbled the Corps out upon the Ground, and cover'd it with the Saw-Dust that came out of the Coffin. Says I, this Corps will soon be discover'd by the smell if ye leave it here, and then I shall come into a scrape, and my Master may lose his place: No, says he, it has been Buried so long that there's no fear of smelling. Then he cut the Lead to Pieces, and we carried it to Mr. Moore. There was about one Hundred and a half of it. When Mr. Paine came to me, I ript up the Shrond , and shew'd him the Body. The Shroud look'd as fresh and as white as the Shirt on your Lordship's Back.
Prisoner. Did not you take the Mallet out of our Vestry? - 'Tis the very Thing that Alderman Parsons knocks with. And did not you borrow the Chissel of your Brother-in-Law?
Warner. No, you brought them both to me.
Prisoner. And will you swear too that you did not carry the Lead to Moore?
Warner. I helped to carry it. And when we came to Moore he seemed unwilling to buy it at first for fear of Trouble. What a Plague in Hell are ye afraid of? says the Prisoner, Don't ye know that I rummage the Church at Aldgate, and that these are my Perquisites? - Well, but (says Moore ) you promis'd to bring me some Coffin Handles. And so I will to Morrow, says the Prisoner, as I hope to be saved, - upon my Life and Soul, - the Devil fetch me if I don't. - And so Moore paid us for the Lead, but stopp'd a Shilling till the Prisoner brought the Handles.
Moore. I would have stopp'd the Lead, but they said it was their Perquisites, and they came honestly by it, and so I gave them 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it, which is the Price that all Old-Iron Shops give.
Prisoner. Warner brought me into the Secret, and said this and that, and t'other, and that I was safe enough , and he could get the Key of Mary, the Sexton's Maid, and would I go one time and another time? But I refus'd to go several times, till at last he persuaded me there was no Danger in it. The Jury found the Prisoner 

               guilty
             of both Indictments.

            , Jan 3

.
The Prisoners came together into Mr. Setree's Shop in Russel-street



, and Carrol asked for some fine Holland, and he open'd several Counters, but none pleas'd her Foy was then standing by the Window, where several Papers of Stockings lay; she had a Ridinghood on, and her Coats were tuck'd up. Smith came in, and passed by the Prisoners without taking any Notice of them, and ask'd for some Scotch-Cloth to line the Body of a Gown for her Mistress: She went to the farther End of the Shop, and said she was in great haste, and then Carrol was in haste too: He endeavour'd to please them both, but they both were very difficult. While he was engaged with them, a Neighbour's Son came in to change a Guinea; he went in for Silver, and as he came out again, he saw Foy was bustling about the Counter, but did not then suspect any thing. Carrol bought half a Yard of Irish-Linen, for which she paid 19 d 1/2, but she borrow'd the Money of Foy ; and while Foy put her Hand in her Pocket for the Money, he observed that she had 2 large Linen Bags, or Pockets, within side her Riding-hood. Then Smith would have some of the same Linen as Carrol had, for which she paid 21 l. The Prisoners went first, and Smith follow'd. Soon after they were gone he missed the Stockings, and went to enquire after his Customers ; for he had seen them before, and heard they lived in the Neighbourhood. He was told that Smith was a Servant to a Gentlewoman that lodged at the Green Canister in Princes-street. He went thither, but could not meet with her; but there he got Intelligence that Carrol was a Servant to Mrs. Mason, at Mr. Hosse's, a Barber, in Russel-street. By good Luck he found them all three standing at Mr. Hesse's Door. Pray, Mistress, says he to Foy, was not you at my Shop just now? I, at your Shop. Fellow, says she, what do you mean? I never was at your Shop in my Life, nor don't know where it stands. However, he secured them, and brought Foy back to his Shop in order to search her.
In pulling off her Ridinghood, two odd Stockings were some how thrown behind the Counter. Smith pretended that she did not know Foy; but Foy and Carrol were drinking hot Pots together that Afternoon, Up-stairs, at the Golden-Lyon in Russel-street, and ordered themselves to be denied to every Body but Smith, who came in a little time, and was sent up to them. Smith left them a little while, and went to - Bowen, a Pawnbroker's, and pawn'd for Half-a-Crown the two Pieces of Cloth they had bought of the Prosecutor just before. Mr. Hosse (to whose Lodger Carrol was a Servant) going Up-stairs, found 2 odd Stockings hung between the Banisters, which proved to be the fellows to the 2 that were found behind the Prosecutor's Counter when Foy was searched. In the Cellar Mr. Hosse found a Handkerchief under the Water-Tub, with several Pair of Stockings in it, which were part of those the Prosecutor lost. Smith was made an Evidence [out did not appear against the Prisoners on their Trail] Foy broke out of the Round house, but Mr. White, the Constable, met her afterwards in Leadenhall-street, and secured her. She offer'd him 5 or 10 Guineas to let her go, and would have given as much to have made it up with the Prosecutor; but after she was sent to Newgate, she said, if they had taken the Money, she would have prosecuted them for compounding a Felony. At Mr. White's House (the King's-Arms Tavern in Russel-Street) Carrol fell on her Knees to the Prosecutor, and said, that her Life was in his Hand, that his Goods had been lost, and she would make him Satisfaction. And when she was in the Coach with Mr. White, who had her in Charge, she said to him, dear Honey White, my Life is in your Power, you may hang me, or save me.
The Defence of the Prisoners.
Foy said, That she spoke to Smith, when Smith came by her in the Prosecutor's Shop, and that after she heard Smith had sworn against her, she was coming to surrender herself, in order to take her Tryal, when Mr. White seiz'd her in Leadenhall-Street.
Carrol said, That the Prosecutor knew her before, she having been at his Shop to buy facing and robing for a Gown, and that she told him where she liv'd in the Neighbourhood, and that therefore it was very unlikely she should go to his Shop with a Design to steal.
The Jury 

               acquitted
             Carrol, and found Foy 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.
            

13. Margaret Foy was a second time indicted for 


               privately stealing 3 Pair of Silk Stockings, value 36 s. the Goods of

Bryan Ambler. On Saturday Night about 9 a Clock, as I was in a back Room behind my Shop, I heard a noise, and coming forward, I saw my Boy struggling with Scott (the least of the Prisoners) and he told me that Scott had held him, while another ran away with the Hat.

            . While I was behind the Counter, Scott came into the Shop, and ask'd, what was a Clock? and Whitesides was behind him. Scott clapp'd his Hand on the Flap of the Counter, and held it down, that I should not lift it up to come out, and at the same time Whitesides snatch'd a Hat off the Counter, and ran away with it, and Scott went after him, but I stopt Scott before he had got to the next Door, and got him into the Shop again; I think Whitesides is the other Person, but I cannot swear positively to him.

I happen'd to be at a Shop where Whitesides came in to sell a Hat, and Hatband, he sold the Band for 3 d. and I heard him tell his Companions, that he took it out of such a Haberdasher's Shop, in Cheapside, upon which I went and gave the Prosecutor notice, and we found the Prisoner next Day at the same Shop, where I had seen him before.

Owen Plumstead. I was robb'd in Hare-Street in Brick-Lane

            . I was lock'd out o'Saturday Night, I met the Prisoners in Hare-Street. They ask'd me to take a Walk, and when I had gone a little Way, 
               
                  Harry 
                  Defoe 
               



             pull'd out a pair of Shoes, and said, Will you buy these Davy? No, says I, and then he pull'd off his own old Shoes, and threw them away, and put the other Shoes on; soon after, we met 3 young Fellows, whom we knew, they talk'd with us a little, and bid us good Night, and the Prisoners and I turn'd up Hare-Street again; says 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Defoe 
               



            , Here's a Man asleep, let's see if he has got any Money. And then D'angre put his Hand in the Man's Pocket and took out 3 d. I saw no more, and this was between 1 and 2 in the Morning; I speak nothing but the Truth before God Almighty. Then we went to drink a Dram, and I left 'em in George-Street.

             pass'd us, look'd us in the Face, and went forward; he knew us all, a little way farther, a Man was lying drunk in the Street. Daniel stopp'd when he came to this Man, and cry'd, Hey! God darm ye! what do you I where for? He had hardly spoke, when 2 Men on the other side of the Way, cry'd, Hip! and he went over to 'em. We went to the drunken Man to see if we knew him, but we did not. He then had on his Hat and Wig, and his Shoes too. to the best of our Remembrance, but we will not be positive. We went a-cross the Way to see who they were that hip'd to Daniel, we knew them all four; they were the 3 Prisoners, and 
               
                  David 
                  Wood 
               



            . They began to pick a Quarrel with us, upon which we left 'em, but suspecting that they had, some design upon the drunken Man, we stood at a little Distance and watch'd 'em, we saw 'em all go to him, and rifle him, and then go off. When they were gone, we went and raised him up, and waked him; his Hat, and Wig, and Shoes were taken away, and no Body had been near him but the Prisoners, and Wood, from the time we left him, till we came to him again. We ask'd him if he knew who had robb'd him? and he said, No. They are all Weaver


s in Spittle-Fields




, and the 3 Prisoners were taken about 5 o'Clock that Morning at a Brandy-Shop in Winsord-Street.
Several Witnesses, most of them Weavers, appear'd in behalf of the Prisoners, and swore they knew no harm of them before this time; and the Prosecutor being asleep, and consequently not put in fear, the Jury found them 


               Guilty of Felony only

John Maxey. Going along Lime-street, I saw the Prisoner and another standing at Pewterer's Hall-Gate, and humming a Song, I look'd at 'em by the Light of a Lamp, and did not like 'em.

 last.
The Prosecutors, who were Carpenter


s, had been at Work at a House in Well-Close-Square


. They left their Tools there on Saturday Night, and lock'd the Door; but when they came again on Monday Morning, the Door was open, the Lock taken off, and their Tools were gone. They could not Work without them, and so they went to the Alehouse; while they were there, the Prisoner Lightfoot came into a Hog-butchers Yard with 2 Axes, and an Iron Square, which he set down by a Tub, and went out again, without saying any thing. The Hog-butcher's Men at first thought that the Capenters were coming there to work; but seeing Lightfoot come again, and saunter about the Gate, one of them said, I believe that Fellow is a Thief, upon which Lightfoot curs'd and swore, and went off. When presently a Man came, and said, a Parcel of Carpenters Tools were stolen out of a House in Well-Close-Square. The Butchers went out, and saw the other Prisoner Spaule, in a Leather-Apron, and with a Nail Bag at his Back. The Butchers and the other Man divided themselves, and follow'd the Prisoners at a Distance, in order to surround 'em unawares. Two Boys, who were going from Shadwell to White-Chapel, saw the Prisoners cross a Field, and stop by the Side of a Rail, where they stoop'd down, as if they were digging. The Butchers coming up, the Boys directed them to the Prisoners, whom they took. Some of the Tools were found in a Hole where the Prisoners had hid 'em, and some in Spaule's Apron, which was lying about a Yard from the Hole. Notice was sent to the Alehouse were the Prosecutors were drinking, and they came and own'd their Goods. The Jury found them 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.
             each.

Robert Johnston. My Moather-in-Law is an and Woman, and lik your Loardship, and I went with her tull Bellinsgat to see her tack Water for Datford. I drank a Mug of Ale at Bellinsgat, and saw came back tull Wastminster, and then it was 11 a Clock at Night. I caud in at 
               
                  William 
                  Taylor 
               



            's Hoose at Charing-Cross




 for a hauporth of Snuff. Will ye tack a Dram, Sir, says Taylor? I donna care an I do, Sir, says I, for I am a lattle out of Oarder. And what shall it be, Sir? says he; Why e'en what ye will your sell, Sir, says I, and so he fell'd me out a Glass of Rum. And what is to pay now, Sir? says I; Not a Farthing, Sir, says he, for I taud ye I wad give ye a Dram. Then it shanna go bare-ars'd, Sir, says I, Let us have a Quartern of something that you like best; I think, Sir, says he, that a Dram of Anniseed is as bealing as any thing; then let it be Anniseed, sir, says I. And so I went into a lattle back Place where the Soldiers leave the Arms, and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            , the Prasoner at the Bare, came and sat on the Table by me. Now, Sir, says she, Wanno ye give me a Drom? No, says I, I have just now tacken one. Well, Sir, says she, if you canno drink your sell, I can. And then Taylor came with the Anuiseed, he fill'd a Glass and drank to me, and sat the rest upon the Table, and went away again to some Customers in the Shop. Then I tuck out my Box to tack a pickle of snuff, and put it intull my Pocket again, and she see where it was; and while I reach'd over the Table to fell a Glass, she packt it out of my Pocket.
Court. Did you see her take it?
Johnston. No, my Loard, I donna see her tack it, but she want awa prasently, and I mist it the Minute she was gone. And I caw'd out to Taylor, and he run after her, but when he came back, she said, I cou no catch her, but I know her well enuh, and that Soldier 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



             (the other Prasoner) belongs to her, he goes for her Husband. Then says Guy to me, If you'll give me a Shilling, I'll get it you again to Morrow. That I will, Sir, says I, and I will leave the Money with Mr. Taylor, for I wou no lose the Box, because it is none of my own, and I will give you a Dram now; so I call'd for a Dram, and then says Guy, if you will go with me now, I will carry ye to her, for I ken where she is. As I was going out, Mr. Taylor said, Hauve a care of your Sword, Mr. Joanston. Donna you fear that, Sir, says I, my Sword is sause anab, and the Deel shanna get it from me. Guy carried me to a lattle place where she was, and there was an aud Woman a-Bed in the same Room; Guy can'd for a Dram, what thinks I, do they fall Drams here? Then I demanded my Box of 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            , but Guy desired me to lat it alone till to Morrow, and the aud Woman a-Bed had us not mack a Noise. I tuck her for an aud Woman, but I kenna whether she was a Woman or no, for I did no search her. While I was talking with Guy, Wallis got out of Door, but I prasantly tuck haud of her, and caud oot for the Watch, but no Body came. I carried her along the Street, and Guy follow'd us. I anks'd him what he wanted, and he sad, Sir, I donna want her from ye. Then we came to a wide place, I think ye can it Broken Cross. Aboot 3 a Clock in the Mourning, and there Guy run up against me, laid hand of my Sword, and tore it awa, so that he brock the Belt, and then he tuck to his Heels. The Woman wad a gone awa too, but I wad ne lat her ; says I, You will gang along with me, or I will trail ye by the Leg, and he daum'd to ye. And so I got her back again to Mr. Taylor's Shop, and caud him out of Bed. What is the Matter with you now, Sir? says Mr. Taylor 
               
                  Eloard
               


            , Sir, I have been roab'd of my Sword, says I; and wha has taken it from ye, sir, says he; why, that Fallow, Sir, says I, that pratanded to get my Box for me, kenye what his Name is? O give me a Pan and Ink, and I'll sat ye doon his Name, and what he may find him. So she tuck a Pan and Ink, and sat down a Name. Why, says Taylor, that's the wrong Name, his Name is Stephen Guy, and he belongs to Major Guy's Regiment, he'll mount Kensington Guard to Morrow. But hand your Peace, Maister Joanston, donna ye speak a Word of this Maiter, for an ye do, he'll gang awa, and the Deel canno catch him; he has been in Newgate already, and he wonna like to come here again; but an ye mack no Noise it is tan to one an ye donna see him come strauling this way by and bye. Then I auks'd this 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



             for my Box, and she taud me an I wad give her a Shilling I wad have it again. Let me see it then, said I; No, says she, I will have the Money first. So I ding'd the Money doon upon the Goonter, and then she put her Hond intull her Bosom, and tuck out the Box. About 4 a Clock 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



             came by the Door, and Taylor punch'd me, and said, There's your Man! And upon that Guy tuck to his Heels, but I run after him, and tuck him hand by the Collar, and punch'd him in the Gullet, and so brote him back intull Taylor's Shop; while he was there he went a whisper'd with 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            , and by and by he pack'd a Quarrel with another Soldier, and in the mean time the Woman got off; but she was afterwards tacken up again, and the same Day she pawn'd the Sword to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Skelton

                  Guy 
               



            , pawned this S word to me.
The Prosecutor's Evidence, as far as it related to what past in Taylor's Shop, was confirmed by Taylor himself.


                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



            . While I was drinking a Quartern of Gin at Taylor's Shop, 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



             came in; her Name is Wallis, and not Guy, for she's none of my Wife; the Prosecutor came in soon after, and took her by the Hand, and went into the back Room. When she went out of Door, and the Prosecutor said he had lost his Box, Mr. Taylor asked me if I knew her? I said, Yes; and that if the Prosecutor would go with me, I believ'd I could find her, and so I did. He took her as far as Broken-Cross, and I following them, he bid me go back, and back I went, without meddling with him.


                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            . The Prosecutor brought me to a wide Place, Angel-Court, at the End of Thieving-Lane ; Come, says he, let me have my Bargain here, since you would not let me have it in Taylor's House; and then he laid his Sword down by me in the dark, and staid with me half a Quarter of an Hour; and then I took the Sword, and putting it under the Steps of the Court, I went back with him to Taylor's Shop, and that was the first time that ever I spoke with him in Taylor's Shop, and he told me then, that he should have 140 l. for hanging 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



            , and then he would put a new Suit of Cloaths on my Back. Guy is none of my Husband, though I have a Husband, but Taylor has seduced me from him, and been the Ruin of me: He keeps a notorious Bandy-house. The Jury found Stephen Guy 


               guilty of Felony only
            , and 

               acquitted Hannah Wallis 'on the first Indictment, but found her guilty on the 2 d to the Val. of 10 d.

            . Between 8 and 9 in the Morning, the Prisoner came to Mrs. Ellis's House in Grosvenor-Street




, and order'd some Tea for my Lord Pembroke. She was left alone in the Room where the Tea-spoon and the Nutmeg-grater lay, and they were miss'd soon after she was gone.

            . After I had lost my Goods, the Prisoner was taken up by my Ld Pembroke's Steward, for stealing a Lac'd-head, and when she was before the Justice I got a Warrant to search her Room in the Hay-Market, and there I found this Tea-spoon; she own'd that she had pawn'd a Nutmeg-grater.

            . I believe the Spoon to be my Mistress (Mrs. Ellis's) and I know the Grater to be hers by these Dents.
Prisoner. The Spoon and Grater were my own, as well as a great many other handsome Things that I had about me, for I am none of your poor beggarly inferior sort of People. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

            . On the Friday before the last Birth-Day, as I was at Work at Mrs. Laserre's, the Prisoner came in, and pulling this Brussel Lace Head and Tucker out of her Pocket, she ask'd Mrs. Laserre if she knew any Body that would buy it; she said the Price was 14 Guineas, and that she had it from Mrs. Weaver, my Lady Shelurn's Woman. Mrs. Peach, my Lady Pembrok's Woman hearing of it, came to Mrs. Laserre's, and said, her Lady had lost a Head. Mrs. Laserre sent me to the Prisoner to tell her that a Gentlewoman waited to see the Head, and if she liked it, and the Price, she might be a Customer. I went and fetch'd it, and Mrs. Peach said, she'd swear that that was her Lady's Head; she put it in her Pocket, and went with me to the Prisoner, who told her the lowest Price was twelve Guineas.


                  Catherine 
                  Peack 
               



            . I went with Mrs. Fitz. Williams to the Prisoner's Lodgings, under pretence of buying the Head. I hear, says I, that you have a fine Head to dispose off; Yes, says the Prisoner. And what's the Price? Twelve Guineas. Will not Eight do? No. Then the Constable (who waited below) came up.
Prisoner. I went to see a Gentlewoman of my Acquaintance, who gave me the Head to dispose off for her. I knew of no Body so proper to apply to on that Occasion as Mrs. Laserre my Mantua-maker, and I told her who I had it from. Fitz-Williams has known me these five Years.
Fitz-Williams. Yes, I have so, and I can't say that I ever knew any harm of her before. She told me that my Lady Shelburn was dead, and had left all her Cloaths to her Woman, from whom she had this Head.


                  Hannah 
                  Williams 
               



            . The same Day that the Head was lost, and a little before we miss'd it, the Prisoner came to my Lord Pembroke's House, and ask'd for Mrs. Peach, my Lady's Woman, and I directed her Upstairs.
Court, to the Prisoner. Have you any Witnesses ?
Prisoner. Yes, but I have had no Opportunity of sending for them. I happen'd to get out of Newgate before last Sessions, and since I was taken again, I have been kept close Prisoner in the Condemn'd Hold, and none of my Friends have been allowed to come to me.
Court. Then you have broke Jail it seems. The Keeper had reason to take Care of you.
Prisoner. Broke Jail! No, I only went out.
Mr. Nichols. She made her escape, disguis'd in the Cloaths of a Woman who came frequently to her in Prison. She was taken up for another Felony, and we secur'd her in the Condemn'd Hold; but none of her Acquaintance were deny'd the Liberty of speaking with her. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

            . I keep a Linen Shop in White-Lion-street in Goodman's-Fields




, one end of the Street comes into Rosemary-Lane. The Prisoners came to Lodge at my House for a Day or two, pretending they were going to Holland with Captain Allen, and only waited for the Ship's Sailing. They were recommended to me by Mr. Baily, my next Door Neighbour. About Noon I had Occasion to look in my Drawers, and I saw my Money and Goods were there. I lock'd my Chamber Door, and came down Stairs. The Prisoners lay in the next Chamber to mine. In the Afternoon a Man came to them from Mr. Baily's, and went and fetch'd a Coach; they came down, and paid me 5 s. for five Days Lodging, and then they all three went into the Coach, and one of them bid the Coachman drive to St. James's-street. About Ten at Night I went up to Bed, and opening the Drawer to put some Money in, I found I had been Robb'd. The Spoon I had lost was none of my own, I had lent 10 s. on it.
Mr. Baily. I keep the White-Lyon Alehouse. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Maccartney 
               



             (with whom I had some Acquaintance) brought the Prisoners to my House to get a Lodging for them. Bradley went for the Mistress, and Holms for the Maid. The Mistress had (as she still has) a sort of a scurvy Humour broke out in her Face; she said it came by a Surfeit that she got with Dancing, and that she was going for Holland, to try if drinking the Waters at the Spaw would do her any good. I could not spare Lodging-Room at my House for any more than Maccartney, and so I recommended the Prisoners to Mrs. Jackson for a Bed; but they used to eat and drink at my House, for which in 5 Days they run up 18 s. I saw no Money they had till just before they took Coach, and then Bradley gave me 2 Half-Guineas to take my Reckoning, out of which I did, and returned her 3 s. Maccartney fetch'd a Coach, and he and the 2 Prisoners went in, and Bradley bid the Coachman drive to St. James's-street directly. As it happened, I took so much Notice of the Coachman as to know him again; he wore a blue Coat; he was lame in one Foot, and his Shoe was cut to give it Ease. About 10 at Night, Mrs. Jackson came and told me she was robb'd, and I went next Morning in search after the Coachman, and at last I found him at the Saracen's Head in Camomile-street. I ask'd him to what Place he drove those two Women and the Man? he said at first that he did not care to tell me, because they had charged him not to let me know, if he happened to see me. But after a little Talk with him, he said, Well, Master, you look like a good honest Man, and if you'll give me a Pot I'll tell you. I call'd for a Pot of Beer, and then he told me, that when he had carried them a little way, they order'd him to drive to Billinsgate, where they took Water for Greenwich. I told Mrs. Jackson of this, she went with me, and we found out the Waterman who carried them, and went with him to Greenwich. He brought us to the Porter who had help'd them to a Lodging. Mrs. Jackson went to a Justice for a Warrant, and as she was coming back, Maccartney happened to see her, upon which he ran to the Waterside, took Oars for London, and escaped. We went to the Prisoners Room, and met with 'em both. We searched 'em, but could find nothing about 'em that Mrs. Jackson could swear to but this Shilling.

Mrs. Jackson. I know this Shilling to be Part of the Money that I lost out of my Drawer ; it looks blackish, I suppose it had lain in Gun-powder before I took it; I remember I scupled it and made this Scratch to see if it was good, and besides, here's a little Dent just by the Edge.
Bradley, the Prisoner. After I got out of Newgate. I met with Holms, and we went to a Friend's House, and enquired for a Lodging. A Woman who was there told us, that her Brother Macartney had an Acquaintance who kept an Ale-house, in White-Lyon-street, by Rag-Fair, at which House she believed we might lye; but when we came thither, there was not Room for us, but Mr. Baily, the Man of the House, provided us a Lodging at the Prosecutor's, who lived next Door to him. Mrs. Holms and I had agreed to go to Holland with Capt. Allen, but while we waited for the Ship's setting Sail, we happened to quarrel, and she threatned to tell Mrs. Jackson that I came out of Newgate, upon which I was resolv'd to leave that Lodging.
Court. Why did you at first order the Coachman to go to St. James's, and as soon as you were got out of the Prosecutor's Hearing, bid him drive to Billingsgate ?
Bradley. Because at first Mrs. Holms intended t o go to her Sister in St. James's, but soon after she chang'd her mind, and was willing to go with me. The Jury 

               acquitted
             Holms, and found Bradley 


               guilty to the Value of 1 s.

Mr. Curll sworn.
Court. What is your Name?
Curll. Edmund Curll.
A Juryman. Curr did you say, or Cull?
Curll. No, 
               
                  Curll, C


            , U. R double L.
Court. What have you to say against the Prisoners?
Curll. My Lord, for about a Month past, I have been obliged to attend on some of my best Customers at the other End of the Town, and in that Time I lost a great many Books. I may say, with a good Conscience, to the Number of 60 Volumes. I could not imagine which way they went, till going thro' Russel Court, I saw 17 Volumes of 'em lying all a-Row upon Gibson's Stall. Seeing more but his Wife in the Shop, I ask'd her where her Husband was? and she called him down. I told him those were my Books, and asked him who he bought them of? He told me, Of a Girl, who said she brought 'em from a Relation of hers in York-street. That he had bought 3 Parcels of her, for which he had given her 10 s. beside 2 s. 6 d. which he lent her on the last Parcel. Well, says I, don't expose yourself, but come to my House and drink a Dish of Tea with me to morrow, and I will shew you the respective Glass-Cases from whence these Books were taken. So I took away the 17 Volumes.
Court. Had you a Constable with a Warrant?
Curll. No, my Lord, In the Warmth of my Loss, I took them without a Warrant, for which indeed Mr. Justice Du Veil blamed me.
Court. And with good Reason, you ought not have done so; it was very wrong.
Curll. It was more than I knew, my Lord; but if I have committed any Error, I hope your Lordship will excuse it. Mr. Gibson delivered the Books to me very readily, and he came to drink Tea with me next Day, and I shew'd him the respective Places where the Books were taken from. Then I call'd down my Girl (the other Prisoner) she's about 15 Years old. And Mr. Gibson said, it was she: that brought him the Books. I tax'd her with it, and she own'd that she had sold several Parcels to him, for which she had receiv'd 12 s. 6 d. I justly had more Resentment against the Buyer than the Child, and tho' I have been obliged to do Justice in this Court, God, forbid that I should be guilty of the Blood of any one! I have done nothing hither to without the best Advice, and will do nothing but what is just and honourable. I would take the Directions of this Court in any Case; and as Justice and Mercy always go together, here I hope to have them both. The Girl had lived with me about 3 Months, and I am sure I had the greatest Tenderness imaginable for her; I doved her next to my own Flesh. I can prove nothing of my self, I know nothing but by her own Confession; and God for bid that I should charge her with any thing farther than I know.
Court. What did you do after she had confest this?
Curll. I did not do any thing with her that Day; I cou'd do nothing, but it gave me much Pain. I have told the naked Fact with the strictest Justice in the World. God forbid I should do otherwise!
Court. What Books did you lose?

Curll. Let me see. I have them all in Court, but they are sealed up in a Bag. Here, Cholmly the Constable, bring the Bag forward, break open the Seal. Pish! Here, here; you take it the wrong way. Ay, now you are right; give me the Books. Three, 7 and 5 is 12 - 16 - one more, that's right. Here's 17 Volumes. Here's the 4th Volume of the Antiquities of Surry in Octavo, large Paper. There are 5 Volumes in the Set, which I value at 5 Guineas, 2 Volumes ditto, small Paper; the whole Set is 5 Volumes, Value 3 Guineas, 2 Volumes of the Antiquities of Westminster, one Volume of the Antiquities of Rochester. These 3 Antiquities in my Hand are the Breach of 3 Sets, all span new, 11 Guineas as good as any in my Pocket. Then here's L'Estrange's AEsop compleat, Denham's Poems, the devout 
               
                  Christian 
                  Companion 
               



            , and the Lord knows how many more. O! here's a particular Volume that I lost out of my own private Closet up 2 pair of Stairs backwards; 'tis a Collection of Pieces relating to Dr. Sacheverell, The Mouse Trap, Van's House, Meditations on a Broomstick, and several other Things bound up together,
Cholmly, Constable. After Mr. Curll had taken the 17 Volumes at Mr. Gibson's House, I went with a Warrant to search for more, and found 3 other Books, which Mr. Curll pick'd out and own'd. I really believe that Mr. Gibson bought them in Ignorance, for he told me readily that he had bought several of the Girl; as for the rest of the Books that have been produc'd, I had them at Mr. Curll's Shop, and cannot say whether they were ever in Mr. Gibson's Possession.
Court. Have you that Warrant in your Pocket?
Constable. I believe not. No, I cannot find it.
The Defence of the Prisoners.
Sarah Beeston. I never stole the Books. There were other People in the House besides me. A considerable Number of Witnesses, who had known her from her Infancy, or who had entrusted her in their Families, gave her an extraordinary good Character.


                  James 
                  Gibson 
               



            . The Books that Curll found in my Shop, were bought of this Girl. My Wife bought the first Parcel when I was not at home. The second Time she brought 4 Books for which she asked a Crown, and I gave her 4 s. I asked her who sent her; she said an own Cousin of hers, with whom she lived, at the End of York-Street. I thought that she look'd like an honest Girl, and so I bought them with the less Scruple. I have no great Judgment in Books my self; I am a Carpenter by Trade, the Book-selling is my Wife's Business. The Girl came again when I was from home, and sold some more to my Wife. The last Time she came, I told her, I would buy no more of those Books, till she brought the Gentleman whom she said she came from. She told me very readily, that he was not at home then, but she would bring him as soon as he came in. I was in haste to go out, and expecting to see her again, I threw down half a Crown in part for the Books she had then brought. I exposed the Books at my Door, and there Curll found them. I described the Girl to him; he said she was his Servant; that he believed I was an honest Man, and if I'd come to breakfast with him in the Morning, he'd put me to Rights; and so he took away 17 Volumes. My Neighbours advised me not to go alone to Curll, but by all means to take Witnesses with me, for fear he should draw me into a Snare. When I went I knew his Girl at first Sight. He would have had me to have prosecuted her. I told him I knew not how to do it, and as he had taken the Books from me, and had had them in his own Possession a Day and a Night, I could not pretend to swear to them. He was in a violent Passion; he went up Stairs and brought down a Shagreen Box. Here Gentlemen, says he (for several were in Company, and he did not direct his Discourse to any one in particular) this Box has been broke open, and 10 Guineas and a broad Piece taken out of it. Now, what would you have a Man do in such a Case; 'tis hard if I must lose all; I expect some Satisfaction: Take your choice; if you'll give me Satisfaction for my Money, I'll fit down with the Loss of my Books; If you'll make my Books good, I'll take up with the Loss of my Money. As he did not ever pretend that I had any thing to do with his Money Box, I wondred what he meant by making such a Proposal: And as I knew my own Innocence, I was resolved to take my Trial.


                  Thomas 
                  Corbett 
               



            , Bookseller. I have known Gibson several Years, he's a Carpenter by Trade, and knows little of Books ; but it was his Wife that chiefly managed the Bookseller's Business, she being a Bookseller's Daughter. He has the Character of a very honest Man. Several of the Books he bought of the Girl were odd Volumes, and therefore of very small Value. But if the Sets had been compleat which Curll values at three Guineas a Set, I don't believe any Bookseller would have given half the Money for them.
Curll. If you don't know how to make so much of them, I do.


                  William 
                  Threadkill 
               



            . I have known Gibson seven Years, and he bears a very good Character. I saw Curll take the Books from his Stall, and he assisted Curll in looking them out; says Curll, I believe you are a very honest Man, and 't was my Girl that brought you these Books; but her Friends are very able Persons, and if you'll come to my House, we'll set this Matter to rights.
Curll. I could not say that her Friends were very able, because I know otherwise; but I said they were very honest.
Threadkill. When we were at Curll's House, he brought a Box, and told us he had lost (I don't know whether it was 7 or 10 Guineas and a Broad Piece) out of it, and that 't would be very hard if he must lose all, and that if he could have his Money again, he would bear the Loss of his Books; or if he was satisfied for his Books, he would put up with the Loss of his Money. The Constable came in and said, Who Charges this Girl? And says Curll, I can't well do it, but Gibson may. Says Gibson, you have had the Books a Day and a Night in your Custody, and I can't swear now that they are the same as you took from my Shop. There is a Book about Dr. Sacheverell, which I have lent to my Ledger, I don't know but it was bought of the Girl with the others. Says Curll, I have lost no such Book.
Curll. The Book he named was Dr. Sacheverell's Trial; not the Collection of Pamphlets relating to the Doctor.
Several other Witnesses appeared to his Reputation, and gave him the Character of an honest industrious Man. The Jury found

            . I met the Prisoner and another Woman in Long Lane and asked them for a Lodging.

                  Emerton 
               



            . Don't you damn your Soul too much you Dog! is it fit that any Rogue should knock my Teeth out? and now you want to swear my Life away and my Husband's too.
Dowatt. And so they picked me up, and carry'd me to the Prisoner's Lodging. I must needs say I was a little in for't F. E. I won't be tried, I won't speak one Word till my Husband is clear'd, I won't, I won't, [she stamps about till her Cap falls off] No, I won't put my Cap on. He's a Rogue. D. and so I say they took me to the White Horse in Chick Lane


. and there, as soon as I laid my self upon the Bed, they stript me by main Force, and took away my Money and my Watch. F. E. Ah you Dog! I wish I was a Man for your Sake. D. And then one said to t'other. Let's murder him. F. E. You lie, Sirrah, you lie, you Hang-in-Chains Rogue. D. So I got up to run away, but the other Prisoner (her Husband) stopt me at the Door, and took hold of my Collar. I heard the Watch go by past 12 a Clock, and I cry'd out Murder, for God's sake help. And so with much a do I forc'd my Way out, and run naked into the Street. F. E. O you damnation Rogue. D. Next Morning he offer'd to make it up with me, and said, I should have my Watch and every thing again, if I would but be easy.

             Watchman. As I was beating the Hour of 12, I saw the Prosecutor as naked as ever he was born, except his Shirt, and he told me he was Robb'd.


                  Frances 
                  Emerton 
               



            . Here's another Hang-in-Chains Son of a B - ; arn't you asham'd of yourself you Rogue?
Price. And he run up the Alley as far as Church-lane. F. Emerton. You lie you Dog.
Price. I went into the Room that the Prosecutor came out of, and the Prisoner 
               
                  James 
                  Emerton 
               



             was standing leaning upon a Table, and the Prosecutor's Clothes lay in the Room by him, and we found every thing but his Watch and his Buckles.

                  Emerton

            . I and another Woman met this Man in g lane and I saw his Eye was cut and I asked him how it came, and he said by quarrelling with a Man in Morefields. So we went into a Shop for a Quartern of Gin to wash his Eye ; and when I had wash'd it with the Gin, I made Water and wash'd it with that too. And so says he to th'other Woman, shall I go home with you? and she said yes; and so I went with 'em. They 2 went to bed together; and by and by my Husband comes home dead drunk, at which this Fellow was frighted, and so got out of Bed, and call'd the Watch, because I wou'd not lie with him as well as t'other Woman. And he has sent a Man to New Prison for cutting his Eye, and now he swears it to my Husband, and he's a vile Rogue for his Pains; and Will. Balt a Runner of Newgate knock'd this Tooth out of my Head, for which I have got Alderman Brocas's Warrant against him. Dear Gentlemen, take it into Consideration; do what you will with me, let all Punishment be due to me, but clear my Husband; don't hang him whatever you do. The Jury 

               acquitted
             the Husband, and found the Wife 


               Guilty of Felony only, to the Value of 10 d.

            . I live with my Mother at the Dutch Ware-house against Durham-Yard in the Strand. Last Friday Night I met Isabella Eaton and the Prisoner, and another Woman in the Strand. We went into the Half-Moon-Tavern, and had 2 Pints of Wine. We staid about half an Hour, and then took Coach, and drove to a Brandy shop (kept by one Soamn ) in Red-Lion-street. I did not go into the Shop, but called for a Quartern of Citron-Water at the Door, for which I paid 1 s. Eaton asked me to lye there, but I refusing, she and I and the Prisoner took the same Coach, and drove to the Greyhound-Inn in Drury-Lane


. We went up Stairs, and had two Pints of Wine, and then Eaton and I went to Bed, and the Prisoner went down. I knock'd so a Bottle of Water, the Prisoner brought it up, and said she would come to Bed too, and lye with me all Night. I suspecting she had some Design, got up, and put on my Breeches, took the Money out of my Pocket, and counting it, parted the Gold from the Silver, and put the Gold, which was two Guineas and a half, a Broad-piece and a Moidore, into my Right-side Pocket, and thrust my Handkerchief down upon it. Then I laid down (not in, but) on the Bed, and the Prisoner with her Cloaths on lay by me. I fell asleep, and between 4 and 5 in the Morning I felt her Hand. I catch'd hold of her Hand, and ask'd her what Business she had with it in my Pocket? But she got her Hand away, and told me that it was not there. I did not search her then, for feeling on the out-side of my Pocket, I felt some Money within, so that I thought my Gold was safe; but in a Quarter of an Hour Eaton got up, and they were both going away in a Hurry. This gave me a Suspicion, and so searching my Pocket within-side, I found only 2 Shillings, and 2 Sixpences, instead of my Gold: I tax'd 'em with it, and they both owned they had got my Money (but not how much) and said, they would keep it, except I would give 'em two Guineas of it, and then they would return the rest.
Court. Did they say how they got it?
G. A. No. I sent for a Constable. Eaton was very outrageous, and broke the Door to get away before the Constable came, but the Landlord prevented her. We all went to the Constable's House, and there Moll Harvey came and made a Riot, and so Bell Eaton escaped. The Prisoner produced all my Money to the Constable, and said she had it of me, but that I gave it her to lye with her.

Prisoner. Had you no more Gold about you, than what you charge me with? G. A. No,
Sral Gra. I live at the Greyhound-Inn. The Prisoner and Bll Eaton, and this little Gentleman, came in a Coach, and asked for a Bed. Says my Mistress, Don't ye want two Beds ? No, Madam, says the Prisoner, but I hope it will be no Offence to go up, and take Part of a Pint with my Friend, and this Gentleman. The Gentleman pull'd out some Gold and Silver, and paid for his Bed, and a Pint of Wine, and so they all went up together. When that Pint was out, says the Prisoner; We will have my Pint now. And so it was brought up. Says Eaton to the Prisoner, I am sure the Gentleman is more generous than to let you pay for it. So the Gentleman paid. I left 'em, and the Prisoner came down soon after. Madam, says she to my Mistress, can't I drink a Pint of Wine with you? Yes, and welcome, says my Mistress. Then the Prisoner sent a Porter for her Husband (as she call'd him) who came directly. They sat down together in the Kitchen, and call'd for another Pint. By-and-by I heard the Gentleman knocking above Stairs. I ran up and asked him what he knock'd for? He said, for a Bottle of Water. I came down and filled a Bottle, but the Prisoner snatch'd it from me, and carried it up herself, and lock'd the Door. Go up, saysmy Mistress to me, and see why she stays; and tell her that I will never suffer such Doings, as for two Women to lye with one Man, for it is not the Practice of my House. I went up to the Door, and told the Prisoner my Mistress wonder'd she staid so long. Damn ye, says she, I'm a-bed. Says I, Your Husband wants ye. Let him go Home about his Business, says she, for I tell ye, I am a-bed, and won't come. With that the Gentleman open'd the Door, and said, 
               
                  Young 
                  Woman 
               



            , what d'ye want. I told him, my Mistress would not suffer such Things, as two Women to one Man. Then he took some Gold in his Hand, and look'd at it by the Candle, and put it into his Side-pocket; and I went down and told my Mistress, that I thought they design'd to rob him. Says my Mistress, I never was served in this Manner by two Women before. I'll sit up all Night, but I'll see whether or no a Gentleman shall be robb'd in my House. The Prisoner's Husband said nothing to this, but got up and went away. About 5 in the Morning my Master was coming down Stairs, the Prisoner and Eaton had open'd the Chamber-door softly, and were coming out. Hey! says he, here's two Woman a creeping away. The Gentleman hearing this, got from the Bed, and they were forced in again. Eaton made a great Disturbance, and would have got out o' Window, but being prevented, she gave the Gentleman several Slaps o' the Face. He said, Very well, Madam! I shan't strike you. Then she went to break the Lock of the Door with a Candlestick, and at last she split the Door, but they kept her from getting out. The Gentleman said he had been robb'd, and desired a Constable might be sent for, and a Constable came and carried them all three to his own House.
Prisoner. When you came to call me down, and the Gentleman look'd at his Money by your Candle, did you see any Guineas, or a Moidore, or a Broad-piece in his Hand?
Grant. I saw Gold in his Hand, but I don't know what Sort. He seem'd to hold it as if he was counting it, and I bid him take Care of it.

            , who keeps the Greyhound-Inn at the Corner of Russel-street in Drury-Lane, came to my House last Saturday Morning about six a Clock, and desired me to come and take the Prisoner, and Eaton, who, he said, were making a Riot, and disturbing his Lodgers. I went thither, the Prosecutor charg'd them with robbing him of 2 Guineas and a half, a Moidore, and a Broad-piece. The Prisoner shewed me the same Pieces, and said he had given 'em to her to lye with her. I put 'em to their Choice, to go to my House or the Watch-house, till the Justice was up. They all chose my House, and so I took 'em with me. Eaton offer'd me half a Guinea dry, and half a Guinea to be spent, if I would not carry her before Justice Du Veil ; but when I would not agree to her Terms, she catch'd up a Case-Knife, and offer'd to stick me, but I avoided the Blow; and by-and-by Moll Harvey, with a Mob of I believe an Hundred Pick-pockets, came and made a Riot about my House, and so Eaton escaped.
Prisoner. But I never offer'd to stir; for I said I had done no Crime, but had got the Money of the Gentleman faitly. He and I have been old Acquaintance.
G. A. I never saw her Face before that Night. She said before Justice Dn Veil, that I gave her all my Money in Red-Lion-street.
Prisoner. I say so still, and I'll prove it.

            . I live in Short's Gardens, About a Week ago the Prisoner came to my House to enquire for a Lodging. I told her I wou'd Lett none under Half a Crown a Week. She said she would call again, and bring her Husband with her, and directed me to enquire her Character at Mr. Soams's, a Brandy-shop in Red-Lion-street. So o' Friday Night one came to know if I would let the Prisoner and her Husband lye at my House. I went down to Soams's, and there was she and this Gentleman. I asked Soams if that Gentleman was her Husband. He said, he did not know that he was. With that I refused to receive 'em, and thereupon the Gentleman pulled some Gold and Silver out of his Pocket, and said to me; Perhaps you are afraid we have got no Money. Whereof the Prisoner says to him, Now, my Dear, if you'll give me enough to fetch my Things out of Pawn, I'll go with you to an Inn. So he gave her some Money, but I don't know how much. I am sure I came here very much against my Desire, but she sent a Paper to me, and threatened to ruin my Husband (who is a Cabinet-maker) if I did not appear for her.

            . I was drinking at Soams's o' Friday Night, and after 9, this Gentleman and the Prisoner, and another Woman came in. He called for a Tiff of Punch, and seem'd very free with the Prisoner, more than with the other Woman.
Court. The Prosecutor swears he did not go in at all, but only drank a Dram at the Door.
Whitney. No, he came in and drank Punch. And he kiss'd and embraced the Prisoner very soudly. And then came in a Woman about a Lodging, and as soon as this Woman was gone, says the Prisoner to him; If you will give me Money to fetch my Cloaths out of Pawn, I'll go with you to an Inn. The Gentleman gave her some Gold, and she told it out in her Hand: There was a Moidore, a Broad-piece, and 2 Guineas, and a half. She told it out in her Hand, and said, that was not enough. Court. And what did she do with the Money, when she said it was not enough? Whitney. As she could get no more, she took up with that. Court. How came you to observe the Pieces so particularly? W. I stood pretty near to her. Court. Did you know her before? W. No. C. How came she to find you out then? W. She heard of me at Mr. Soams's. C. Are you one of his constant Customers? W. No: But I am one of the same Business; I have kept a Brandy-shop in Gray's-Inn-Lane above half a Year. We often go to see one another. I drink at his House, and he drinks at mine. I carry Customers to him, and he brings Customers to me; and so we live very sociably.

            . I keep a Brandy-shop in Red-Lion-street. About 10 a Clock o' Friday Night, the Prisoner and this Gentleman came into my Shop, and drank a Dram a-piece, and then they went and sate behind the Counter, and call'd for a Tiff of Punch. Says he, We won't sit here, let's go to an Inn. Says she, You have often promised to fetch my Cloaths out of Pawn, And, says he, you shan't want Money for that. And so he gave her a Moidore and a Guinea. Is this all? says she. And then he gave her a Broad-piece, and half a Guinea, or a Guinea, I don't know which. She told him that was not enough; and then he said, he'd give her more when they came to the Inn, and so they went away in a Coach.

            . This is the very Man that the Prisoner sent for to our House, and he pass'd for her Husband. And he's one of Moll Harvey's Bail.
Prisoner. I have no Husband, nor never had.
Court. Did you never pass for her Husband? Was you never reputed to be her Husband?
Soams. No. S. Grant. When he came in, my Mistress said, Is this your Wife? And he answer'd, Yes. Court. You seem to be pretty much at her Beck, however.

About a Fortnight ago, as I was coming down Stairs, she called me in to drink Tea, and this Gentleman was with her, and I heard him promise her some Money. And about a Month ago I saw her go out with him in a Coach.
Prisoner. He has promised me Money many a Time; and this Prosecution is only out of Spite, because I would not go to Bed with him along with

In my way home to Shadwell, I lay down in Denmark-street in Ratcliffe High-way


, I fell fast asleep, and did not wake till 2 in the Morning. At first I wonder'd where about I was, and what was become of my Shoes and Stockings, my Blue Apron, and my Hat. But at last I bethought my self, that some Body had found me a-sleep in the Street, and had undress'd me, so I went barefooted as I was towards the Watch-house, to enquire if any idle Person had been taken up; but I could hear nothing of my Cloaths, till about 9 that Saturday Morning, when a Friend told me that Mr. Ludlow, a Goldsmith, in Upper-Shadwell, had stopp'd the Prisoner upon her offering to sell him a pair of Silver Buckles which proved to be mine. She was carried before the Justice, and committed to Bridewell, before I saw her, and when

From Bridewell she was carried again before Justice Jones, and she then had my Apron on: He sent her to Newgate. Court. What did she say before the Justice? Prosecutor. She nothing but Swore and Curs'd, and talk'd Bandy.

            . Watchman in Upper-Shadwell. As I was beating my Rounds at one a Clock, I saw the Prisoner sitting at a Door in West-Garden, with a vine Hat in her Lap. What dost thee do here? says I. Why I want a Dram, says she, will you give me one? Where didst thee get such a vine Hat? says I. Why it is my Husband's Hat, says she again. So I goes home, and she comes to my House, and calls vor a Dram. Well, says I, however thee didst come by this Hat, or where thee didst get'n, the Devil don't know; but sure thy Husband never had such a one to his Back. Why, zays she, I have got his Zhoes and Ztockings too in my Apron, and I will leave 'em all with you till by and by. Zo she pull'd'n out, and I took'n and throwd'n by, but I thought they hardly did belong to she. Zo, when she came again vor 'em about 2 a-Clock, zays I, thee must tell me how thee didst come by'n bevore I let thee have'n again. After this I zee a Man coming along bare-vooted, and bare-leg'd, and without a Hat. Hoy! hoy! says I, what a Plague beest thee, that thee runs naked a that'n; but I did not think that the Things that Prisoner lest at my House did belong to he.

I suspected she had stol'n 'em, and sent for a Headborough, who carried her before a Justice, by whom she was committed to Bridewell. The Prosecutor came about an Hour after, and claimed the Buckles. He said he lost them as he lay a-sleep in the Street; they were mark'd with his Name.
Prisoner. After I had sold my Nosegays I met the Prisoner between 9 and 10 at Night, in Ratcliff-Highway. He took me into a dark Entry in an Alley, and after he had had his Will upon me, he said he had no Money, but if I would pawn his Buckles for 7s. 6d. he would give me half a Crown for obliging her. So he took 'em out of his Shoes, and gave 'em me, but I could not get so much upon 'em, and so I went to sell 'em. The Jury found her

Henry Seagood, I live in Little Bartholomew-Close


. On the 27th of July, between 11 and 12 at Noon. I left the Sash of my Ground-room next the Yard shut, and my Goods lock'd up in my Drawers; but returning in a Quarter of an Hour, I found my Sash pull'd down, my Locks broke, the Drawers upon the Floor, and that Apparel and Linen had been taken away, to the value of 15 l. A Girl told me that she saw a Creature in the Yard with a Bundle, and asked her what she did there? And the Creature said, What's that to you, ye Bitch, or some such Words. The Girl shew'd us which Way she went, and we follow'd, and found her in Long-lane.

She asked 3 s. 6 d. for the Head, and 2 d. for the Russels. I told her, I was afraid she did not come honestly by them, and then stepping out to call a Neighbour, she run down Seacoal-lane.

William Saint. The Prisoner was my Servant
. On the 9th of July he ran away from me at Sheerness, and took my Boat with him. While I and my Wife were at Ghent in Flanders, I received a Letter from 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Riddle 
               



             (who I left in my House in St. Catherines


) informing me that my House had been robb'd by my Man Harry. I took a Post-Chaise to Dunkirk, and from thence sent my Wife Home in a Vessel before me. When I came Home, he owned to me in New-Prison, that he got upon the House by the help of 2 Poles, and so into the Garret-window on the Saturday-night; that he was in the House 20 Hours; that (when Riddle went out on Sunday-morning) he went into every Room of the House, and ransackled all the Drawers, and that he had really broke 14 or 15 Locks.


                  Thomas 
                  Riddle 
               



            . As I was smoaking my Pipe about 9 o'Clock o' Sunday-night, at a Neighbour's House, some of Madam Saint's Neighbours sent me Word, that the Street-door was open, and Captain 
               
                  Saint
               


             had sent me a Letter before, that his Man Harry was run away. So I thought it was Harry's doings; and upon searching the House, I found his Hat in the Garret, and a Hammer and Gimblet under the Bed-Quilt up one Pair of Stairs. The Garret-door was broke open, and 2 Panes taken out of the Garret-window. The Prisoner was taken next Day by a 
               
                  Young 
                  Man 
               



            , who brought him to Mr. Cooper's over against Capt. Saint's House. He confess'd that he got up to the Garret-window by 2 Poles, and then sot a Top of the House till his Companion came up, and took out 2 Panes of Glass out of the Garret-Window, and so open'd it and got in. That the Fellow, his Companion, staid half an Hour in the House, and then went down the same way as he came; but that he himself got in about 10 or 11 at Night, and lay there till next Day. We found this Pocket-Piece, and Pocket-Bottle upon him, which he said he took out of the Desk; this Hat out of the Closet; and this Purse with a Silver Scissars-Chain ; these Girdles and Buckles out of the Drawers; and so I sont the Captain 
               
                  Word
               


             of what had happen'd.

                  Saint 
               



            . I was in Flanders with Mr. Saint, when, Riddle sent me Word that my Man had broke open my House, and stole my Goods. This is my Stone Buttle, and my Silver Girdle; they were in my Drawers in my Fore-Room, and this is my Purse, and all the Things that are in it are mine, and they were taken out of my Drawers in my Back-Room.
The Jury 


               acquitted him of the Burglary, and found him guilty of Felony only, to the Value of 39 s.

            . I keep a Coffee-House in Malborough-Street, in St. James's. Mr. Webb had a House to be Lett, in Great-Marlborough-Street


, and lost the Care of it to me. The Prisoner Turner came and told me, that he wanted to see the House, for a Gentleman of his Acquaintance having a mind to take one thereabouts. I told him the Painters were at work there, and they would let him see it.

            . I and my Son-in-law were doing the Painter's work in Mr. Webb's Back-house. There's a Garden betwixt the Back-house and the Fore-house. The 2 Prisoners came and desired to see the Fore-house, I told 'em they might go in, and they went; but soon after they were gone, says I to my Son, I have something comes upon my Mind, that these are not honest Men, is there any thing loose about the House that they can take away? There's nothing, says he, but the Brass Locks that lie in the Window. So I went after them, but they were gone; I saw the Chain was taken off the Street-Door. I presently open'd the Door, and looking out, I saw them both running down the Street. I call'd to my Son, he jump'd down from a Scaffold 12 Foot high, and came running to me. He look'd in the Window, and by God, says he, they have got the Locks! we pursu'd them to Tyburn-Road, crying out, stop Theif! stop Red-Coat and Blue-Coat. They run hard, and at the turning a Corner, they dropt a Bag with the Locks in it, and were soon after taken.

Prisoners. We are Painters by Trade, and went to see the House, and while we were in it, some People coming by, and reading the Bill at the Door, they desir'd to see it too. We told them they might and welcome, for it would not do for us, and so we let 'em in, and left them there.

George Bond. Between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon the prisoner came to my Shop, and ask'd for a pair of blue grey Stockings, I shew'd her a Paper in which there were just a dozen pair. She then wanted a different Colour. I turned about and took down another Paper. We did not agree about the Price. She went out, but came in again before I had put up the Stockings, and desir'd to see another pair. I observed her to double up one pair that lay on the Counter. I turn'd about again to reach another Parcel. She look'd over several, but not liking the Price she went away a second time. I miss'd 2 pair; I went after her, brought her back, found one pair in her Bosom, and another pair in the Lining of her Gown. She own'd that one of the Pairs was mine, but said that she bought the other pair at another Hosiers.
Prisoner. I cheapen'd 2 pair of Stockings, the Prosecutor ask'd me 5 s. 6 d. I bid him 5 s. and took out the Money and laid it on the Counter, but am not sure whether he took it up or no. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

Charles Smith. I am one of the Waiters

            . The Prisoner came into Mr. Major (a Barber)'s Shop in Bishopsgate-street


, between 3 and 4 a Clock; he complain'd of the Strangury, and went backwards into the Yard. I suppose at that time he put the Wig into his Breeches. He soon came back and stood talking in the Shop about a Quarter of an Hour, and then went away. I mist the Wig in a few Minutes after it was gone, and went directly to Middle-Row in Holbour, and at the 3d Wig-shop I came to I found it. Mr. Horn who keeps that Shop had it in his Hand when I came in, and he said it was not 5 Minutes since he bought it.
- Horn. I bought the Wig of the Prisoner on the 11th of September, towards the Evening; he said, he had it to sell for a Gentleman's Servant. He ask'd a Guinea and a half, I bid him 25 s. and a Shilling for himself; he said he would have half a Pint of Winethen, and so we agreed. I did not mistrust him, because I had known him a pretty while. He gets his Bread by making up Wigs, and I have bought a great many of him, and took him to be a very honest Man. So that when Mr. Major's Man came in and said the Wig was stolen, you must needs think I was very much surpriz'd, and wonder'd how the Devil came to put it into the Prisoner's Head.
Prisoner. I found the Wig. The Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

 and it was found upon the Prisoner in less than a Quarter of an Hour afterwards.
Court. Was the Prisoner in your Company?
Alexander. I think it was the that brought me Victuals and Drink.
Court. Did you sit in a publick Room?
Alexander. I think so. It was such a Place as People sit in to eat their Victuals.
Court. Was no Body else near you?
Alexander. None but she and her Landlady.
Court. Did not you and the Prisoner go into that House together ?
Alexander. No; I was there before she came in.
Court. How long?
Alexander. Two or three Minutes. I stay'd there above an Hour, and then she went away, and as soon as she was gone I miss'd my Watch. It was a Silver Watch in a sort of a Fish-skin Case, studded with Silver.

Why, say she, I'll tell you what it's about; I have nail'd a Watch, and I shall make my self for ever, if I can find any Body that I can trust to dispose of it for me.
Court. What did you think she meant by nailing?
Peirce. I don't understand those Newgate Words.
Court. Keeper! Can you inform the Court?
Keeper. Not I, my Lord, but I believe some of our People can. I'll ask. Here's one says it signifies stealing.*
* Nailing, is likewise used metaphorically to signify, securing, taking-hold-of, or apprehending. e.g. Tom Beck says of John Davison, He told me himself that Peter Buck was nail'd out of his Company. Vide, Sessions Paper, Numb. 4. pag. 104.

I told him I had cold Flank Beet, or hot Leg of Beef. He chose Leg of Beef; he stay'd about an Hour, or something better, and then she went out. As soon as she was gone, he said he had lost his Watch, and so he went to the Door, and call'd out Watch! Watch!

Prisoner. As I was going along Smithfield with a ha'perth of Plumb-pudding in my Hand, the Prosecutor came up, and ask'd me to give him a bit? With all my Heart, says I, and so I did. Well, says he, since you are so civil, I'll make you drink; and so he took me to a Gin-shop, and gave me a Quartern of Brandy; then, says he, I don't much like this Liquor, but if you'll go somewhere else, I'll treat you with a Mug of Ale. And so I carried him to my Landlady's; there she stands. And there he gave me a Shilling to lye with me. I told him, I would not do it for a Shilling. Well, says he, I'll give you a Crown then; but as I have not so much about me, I'll leave you my Watch in Pledge till I bring you the Money, and so he did. Then I went to

Court to the Prosecutor. Did you give the Prisoner a Shilling?
Prosecutor. Yes, I did.
Court. For what?
Prosecutor. Upon Condition as she said it was customly to give a Woman a Shilling upon such an Account.
Court. And did not she insist upon a Crown?
Prosecutor. No. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

I was not at home when the Goods were lost; but hearing of it afterwards, an Advertisement was put in the Papers, by which means, I was informed that the Prisoner lodg'd at Mrs. Howard's, a Coffee-House, in Bell-Savage Yard. I went thither on the 11th of November, and found the Prisoner. I ask'd her, If she was not at my Shop about a Week before to buy Half a Yard of Muslin? She said, Yes. And did you not, says I, take away a Manteel, and a Piece of Velvet? She answered, Yes; and she said, she had made the Velvet into a Hood.

            . I was in Mr. Townsend's Shop when the Prisoner came in. It was the 3d of November, in the Evening. She ask'd to see some Muslin; I order'd Candles to be brought, and then shew'd her some. She wanted Half a Yard, and whilst we were disputing about the Price, another Customer came in, and while I turn'd my back to serve her, I suppose the Prisoner took away the Goods: For the Manteel with a Bill of Parcels pinn'd up in it, lay ready for a Gentleman who had bespoke it, and a Person coming to fetch it, in about Half an Hour after the Prisoner was gone, I miss'd both that, and a Piece of Velvet of about a Yard with a Slope on it. I suspected she had taken it, and told Mr. Townsend so when he came in. I saw her no more till Nov. 11. when she was taken at Mrs. Howard's. She readily confess'd that she took the Manteel and the Piece of Velvet out of the Shop; that she tore the Slope of the Piece of Velvet, and made it into a Hood, and that she burnt the Bill of Parcels.
Prisoner. I don't know what I confess'd; they came on me by Surprize. I own I had the Goods, but they were sent me from the Bath. Are you sure it was I that came to cheapen Muslin?
M. Nicholas. Yes.
Prisoner. What Cloaths had I on?
M. Nicholas. A short Mob and a wash'd Gown; you was clean dress'd, and looked like a tight Girl.

            . The Prisoner came to me as a Lodger November 4. and gave me these Things in security for her Lodging till her Uncle came to Town.
The Constable confirm'd the Prisoner's Confession, and the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 4s. 10d.

, Oct. 1
.
Mrs. Peers. I lost a Crape Gown and Coat lin'd with black Silk, a Lutestring Gown and Coat lin'd with grey Silk, a white flower'd damask Coat, and several other Apparel out of a Box, which I left lock'd and corded in Mr. Pearson's 
               
                  Garret 
                  Mr 
               



            . Pearson kept a Goldsmith's Shop by Smithfield Bars


. I lodged at his House about a 12 Month, when I went away I left my Box in his Garret. I had been gone from thence about half a Year, when having Occasion for some of my Things, I went thither to fetch 'em. Mrs. Pearson went up with me. I found my Box corded and lock'd as I left it, but as soon as I open'd it I miss'd my Goods. Madam, says I, somebody has robb'd me. She seem'd as much surpriz'd as I was my self. The Prisoner had been her Servant, but was then gone away, and was taken up for another Fact: This gave us Occasion to suspect her. We found her at Hicks's-Hall. She confess'd to me that she had lifted up the Lid of the Box without unlocking it, and drawn the Cloaths out and carried them to pawn, at three several Times, to Mr. Hamlin's a Pawn-broker in Drury-lane. She cry'd, and begg'd me not to hang her. We went to the Pawn-broker's, who used us very ill, and told us we should have nothing but what the Law allowed us.
Mrs. Pearson. The Prisoner had been my Servant
 half a Year, and after she was gone from me, she was committed to Prison for another Offence. When Mrs. Peers mist her Goods, I said to her, I am afraid this Wench has robb'd you. We saw her at Hicks's-Hall, and taking her aside, charg'd her with this Fact. She cry'd, and readily owned it, and said, she hop'd I would be favourable to her, for she had not broke any Lock, but lifted up the Lid of the Box and drawn the Things out, and that she had pawn'd them in Drury-lane. We went to the Pawn-brokers; he deny'd them at first, and would not deliver them till we brought her to him from Bridewell.
Court. What are these Goods worth?
Mrs. Peers. About 10l.
Court. Did she say she took them all at once?
Mrs. Pearson. She said she carried them out of my House at three Times, and so carried them to pawn. She went from me September 12.
Prisoner. They promised me to be merciful if I would confess.
Court. What do you say to that?
Mrs. Pearson. Yes, we did.
Court. Then you did Wrong. You ought not by Promise of Favour to draw Persons into Confession, and then make use of those Confessions to take away their Lives. When Confessions are obtained in such a Manner, they ought to have but little Weight with the Jury.
Mrs. Pearson, We have no Desire to take away her Life.
Court. It may be so. But if the Jury should find that she took the Value of 40s. at any one time, she will be capitally convicted.


                  John 
                  Hamlin 
               



            , Pawn-broker. These Goods were brought to me at 3 times; the 5th, the 12th, and the 13th of September. On the first Parcel I lent 10 s. 6 d. 15 s. on the 2 d, and 30s. on the third. The Prisoner owned the Tickets upon them, but I can't swear that she was the Person that brought them.
Court. It looks very ill in a Pawn-broker to receive such valuable Goods of such a Person as the Prisoner, without examining how she came by them. By her Appearance he could not imagine her to be the Owner of them. These People know if they bought Goods under such suspicious Circumstances at an under Rate, they would be liable to be prosecuted as Receivers of stolen Goods, and they think to evade the Law by lending a Trifle upon 'em to Persons who they are pretty sure will never come to redeem them. I doubt not but in these Cases they know too well that the Goods are stolen, and I hope, in time, it will be equally punished. This Man's denying the Goods, when Persons of Credit came to demand them, has a very knavish Appearance. Officer! don't let the Pawn-broker go out of Court till the Jury have brought in their Verdict.


                  David 
                  Jones 
               



            . The Woman at the Pawn-broker's had the Confidence to tell us that the Goods were not worth above 14s. more than they were pawn'd for; tho' they cost above 30 l.
Mrs. Pearson. He took me by the Arm and thrust me into the Street.
Mr. Jones. And he said to me, The Parliament were not able to do any thing with us, and what do you pretend to do?


                  Joseph 
                  Baily 
               



            . He abused us all in a very gross Manner.
Court. Are you willing to prosecute this Man? It will be doing Justice to your Country.
Mr. Baily. As your Lordship pleases.
Hamlin. I hope you won't serve me so. [a-part].
Mr. Baily. Rememember how you serv'd us. [ a-part ].
Court. Officer, take the Pawn-broker into Custody.
Hamlin. My Lord!
Court. If you can find sufficient Bail the Court will take it.
Then Mr. Baily, and the other Witnesses, entered into Recognizances to prosecute the Pawn-broker at next Sessions. And the Jury found the Prisoner 


               guilty to the Value of 39s.

.
The Prisoner lived above a Year in the Service of Mr. Holms and his Mother-in-Law Mrs. King, who lived in the same House. From thence she went to Mr. Scoley's, where she continued about 3 Months, and he (not missing any thing then) recommended her to Col. Armstrong in the Tower. Mr. Holms after some time missing his Goods, traced her to Col. 
               
                  Armstrong
               


            's, where she, in hopes to escape, jump'd out of the Window and broke her Thigh. Some of Mr. Holms's, Mrs. King's, and Mr. Scoley's Goods were found in her Box, and the Gown in the Bog-House, all which she confess'd she stole. She was sent to the Hospital, and there confess'd where the rest of the Goods were pawn'd, which were accordingly found by her Directions. The Jury found her 

               guilty
             of both Indictments.

            , Nov. 4
.
Drew Drury. I employ'd the Prisoner to polish Silver for me. I had lost a great deal of Silver for above a Year past. 'Tis my Method to weigh my Silver up every Saturday Night, and enter the Quantity in a Book, and I have constantly miss'd every Week, for a considerable Time, 40, 50, or 60 Shillings worth. The Prisoner used to come to my Shop in a Morning before I was up, to see for Work; I order'd my Boys to watch him, and next Morning they told me, they saw him go to a Basket, where I put a pretty deal of Silver, and tumble it over, and then put his Hand in his Pocket 2 or 3 times. I ask'd them, Why they did not stop him and call me? They said, they were afraid. Upon this I was resolved to watch him my self. And so on Saturday Morning, Nov. 4 says I to my Boys, I'll hide my self in the Closet (for I have a Closet with a Window that looks into the Shop) and don't you be mealy mouth'd now, because you know that I am so near you, but when he comes, play your Rogues Tricks, and run about as you do when I am a Bed, that he may suspect nothing, and have an opportunity of going to the Basket. I went to my Post, the Prisoner came in, and my Boys began to play their Tricks with him, and by and by one of them run out, and the other after him. The Prisoner upon this stept to the Basket, took something out, put it in his Pocket, and follow'd them immediately. As soon as they came in again, says he, my Master will hardly came down till 9 a-Clock, I'll e'en go, and come again, but the Boys persuaded him to go into the Kitchen, and sit down by the Fire. I left the Closet, went up Stairs, and came down again as if I was but just come out of my Chamber. The Prisoner ask'd me, if I had any work for him? I told him, No. I let him go out a little way, and then call'd him back. Robin, says I, 'tis Saturday, and as I have no more work for you this Week, I may as well settle Accounts, and pay you for what you have done. I sent one of my Boys for a Constable, under pretence of getting change for a Guinea. When the Constable came, I charg'd the Prisoner. He deny'd the Fact, and said, I might search him and welcome. He took his Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and held it in his Hand. I could find nothing. Sure, says I, my Eyes did not deceive me. When presently my Boys told me, they saw the Silver in his Hand. Upon which the Prisoner took it out of his Handkerchief himself, and gave it to me, and said, This is the Bit. He begg'd that I would not prosecute him, and promis'd that he would never do so any more. [ This Deposition was by the two Boys.]

Prisoner. Did you see me take it?
Mr. Drury. I saw you take something out of the Basket.
Pris. And had you any reason to suspect me before?
Court. He has sworn that he had.
P. This was a Plot laid against me.
C. Yes, and a good one too.
P. Another Man having sent for me to work for him, I was speaking of it in my Master's Shop, and thereupon, I believe he laid this Trap for me, for he's a Man of that good Principle, that he would let no Body live but himself. He has trusted me with a great many Ounces of Silver.
C. Without Weight or Tale?
Mr. Drury. No.
C. Then you were accountable for it.
P. I don't know how it came into my Hankercher; 'tis a Plot; 'tis common to lose 40 or 50 s. a Week, and sometimes my Master has had more Silver than he should have.
Mr. Drury. I might sometimes make a Mistake, but it could not always be so. The Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

Prisoner. My acquaintance with her begun by our coming both in one Ship from Scotland. She told me, she was acquainted with great Men, and could do me Service, and expected I should do her some in return. She said, she ow'd a pretty deal of Money, and knew a way to pay off all her Creditors, which was to leave Goods with me, and pretending she was gone to Scotland, would send them word, that she had left such and such Goods, which if they would take in full for what she ow'd them, and give me a Discharge they might, otherwise they might get their Money how they could. Thus she sent me to Mr. Hayward, a Wine Merchant, with 15l. tho' she ow'd him 70l. He thinking that she was gone to Scotland, and left me to act for her, took the 15 l. in full for the 70. So she compounded with Mrs. Avery, to whom she ow'd 20 l. for less than half the Money. It was upon this Account that she desir'd me to lye in her Room, and if any of her Creditors enquired for her, to tell them, she was gone to Scotland, tho' it was all a Trick. Before she left me, I told her, I had no Money for Necessaries. She said, I need not want, there were Goods enough in her Closet that I might dispose of upon Occasion, for I had her Keys.
F. Naw Sir I last my Keys in my Drawers.
P. She trusted the Keys and Goods too, to my Care, for she and I were very familiar, I have lain with her many a Time.
F. Upon my Oath he never did, why, does your Loardship think I was lye with such a Jackanapes as he is? The Goods I trusted him to give to Mr. Hayward and the Brewer, was before I went out of Town.
P. Here's Mr. Grub, the Pawnbroker, will give an Account of her.
Grub. I know this Woman by the Name of Hamilton. A Piece of these Goods was pledg'd with me. I have dealt with her several Times. She has a very indifferent Character. She would cheat or defraud any Body. She brought me false Plate for good, and I lent her 20 l. upon it.
F. I own I did; but you know it was my Lady Cassells, and it is in her Dining-room now; I was deceiv'd in it, and so was you.

                  Bovin 
               



            . Before Justice De Veil she deny'd that she writ any Letter till he produc'd it. The Prisoner said, he had been very free with her, and sat up with her many a Night. He was ask'd hereupon, if he had lain with her? And he hum'd and haw'd, and at last said, No. 1 and 3 or 4 more went to see her Drawers, there was ho Violence done to them.
Court. She says they were open'd with a false Key.


                  Margaret 
                  Hunter 
               



            , again. He was very ill with a Pain in his Ear 4 or 5 Days after she went out of Town. I got him something to eat, and ask'd him, if he had a Porringer and Spoon? He said, No, for she had lock'd up every Thing.
- Douglas, again. He told me so, and said, she had left him nothing but dirty Sheets.
Mrs. Clark. I lent him a Linnen Towel, and could never get it again.


                  Margaret 
                  Forbes 
               



            . I ask'd Mrs. Fermer, why she left her Goods to his Care? She said, she'd trust him with untold Gold.
Mr. De Veil. When he was brought before me, he said several Things that intimated he had lain with her; upon which I put the Question to him, and he said, that he had not.
Prisoner. I said I had not lain in a Bed with her, and did not then say any more, for fear of being prosecuted by her Husband. But I say now, that I have lain with her several Times, and she told me, if her Husband dy'd, she would have no Man but me. I heard there was a Warrant to take her up for a Cheat.
Mr. De Veil. No; it was only for deluding a young Woman, but she appear'd, and upon Examination was discharged.
P. And she had deluded me too. She's a Woman of a vile Character; she brought a Lawyer with her to a Tavern, and he drew up a Confession, and she promis'd, if I would sign it, that she would not appear against me, but speak to the Jury, and the King in my behalf. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

John Ferrers. The Prisoner came into our Shop, in Blowbladder-Street


, to sell some Goods. We did not chasser with him then, but he setting them down at the farthest end of the Shop, went towards the Street Door, and stood leaning with his Back against the Counter. I and my Maid watch'd him (for I had lost some Goods the Saturday before) and we saw him put his Hands behind him, and take a Parcel of white Balladine Silk out of a Wrapper, and thrust into his Bosom. Then he walk'd a Yard or two farther into the Shop, and I went and collar'd him, and order'd my Man to take the Silk out of his Bosom, which he did: I weigh'd it, and sent for a Constable. The Prisoner seemed very much surpriz'd, and said the Devil egg'd him on to do it. This Evidence was corroborated by the Maid and others, and the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 4s. 10d.

             ; Gale turned short, and said, what do you want with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



            ? and so went into a 
               
                  Gin 
                  Shop 
               



             kept by one Jones. I sent my Wife with the Warrant to get a Constable. Then the Gang that uses that House set upon me, and tore me and hal'd me about like mad; I warrant you there was twenty or thirty of them seiz'd me. You Rogue, says one, and you Dog, says the other, I'll do this, and I'll do that. Then I saw 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             take 15 s. four Pence halfpenny out of my Pocket, and give it to 
               
                  Nel 
                  Walker 
               



            , and went away. Then I seized Gale, and said, you shan't go now, till I get a Constable for you. And upon that all the Gang fell abroad on me again, and got her away directly, but my Wife took her in about a quarter of an Hour after, by the Judge's Warrant. I got a Warrant next Day from Justice Newton, and took Walker.
Gale. Did you mention the Robbery that Night? Freeman. Yes.



                  Ann 
                  Freeman 
               



            . We met Gale as she was turning up Sheer Lane. Says I to my Husband, Stephen! there's 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



            ! She turned back and said, what do you want with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



            ? so she went into a Brandy Shop, and my Husband sent me with the Warrant, and when I came back, there was a great Uproar, and she run away; and a Boy told me, that the Woman that had beat and robb'd my Husband was run up Stairs into 
               
                  Peter 
                  Wattle 
               



            's Coffee-house.
Gale. Freeman met me, and said, Mrs. Gale, I have a Judge's Warrant. Where is your Tip-staff, says I, to serve it? I have none, says he. Where's your Constable then? says I. Why, says he, I am one; and with that he pull'd out a Constable's Staff. You a Constable! says I, how came they to make a Foot Soldier a Constable? so went in to drink at Mrs. Jones's, and had a Quartern of Liquor; and he was so far from losing 15 s. that he had not enough to pay the Reckoning; for when Mrs. Jones asked him for the Money, he said he could not pay till his Wife came, and she afterwards paid for it. He took me into a Tipstaff's House, and he and his Wife-tore my Gown off my Back, and tumbled me in the Dirt ; and he did not charge me with the Robbery till 5 Days after I was committed.
Then the Copy of the Warrant for her Commitment was read. It was for an Assault, without any mention of a Felony, and dated November 6.
Freeman. I was robb'd on the second of November, and changed her on the third.
Court. It's a little strange, that you who was robb'd on the second, and got a Warrant on the sixth, should say nothing then of this Robbery, but only charge her with an Assault.

Court. What Business do you follow?
Kate. I keep a public House in Fleet Lane ; 'tis a Brandy Shop.
Freeman. She keeps no House, she's a common Night-walker.
Constable. I executed Alderman Billers's Warrant on

                  Buck

            . I was at the Castle Alehouse in Sheer Lane, when Freeman brought in Gale, and several more of these Women came with them. There was a great Disturbance and Confusion. I understood he had first carried her to Mr. Davis's, who would not take Charge of her, because she was not brought by a proper Officer. Freeman said he had a Judge's Warrant against her for an Assault, but I heard him make no mention of a Robbery. And he having no Authority to detain her, she made her Escape by the help of the Woman who came with her. 
               
                  Kate 
                  Buck

                  Pearse 
               



            . Without I am to tell the whole Story from Beginning to Ending, I won't say a word.
Court. Have not you another Name?
Pearse. Yes, I have had two Husbands, the first is dead, and his Name was Pearse, and I am Buck's Sister. Nay, you shan't catch me in a Lie; I ow'd Mrs. Jones, the Woman that keeps the Chandler's Shop, 7 s. 6 d. and so -
Court. What do you know of the Prisoners?
Pearse. Freeman brought 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gale 
               



             into the Shop; he would have had her to a Tavern; but says she to him, there has been a great Demur betwixt us, because my Husband keeps that Whore 
               
                  Nan 
                  Parrot 
               



             in your House, and therefore I won't go with you: And so he called for a Quartern.
Court. Do you know any thing of the Robbery?
Pearse. No, but only he charged me with it, and I was discharged by Alderman Billers.
- Thorp. Freeman and his Wife came to my House (the Ship Alehouse in the Old Bailey) and desired me to go with them to look for Gale. We went to Wind-mill-hill, and from thence to Gale's Sister's in Shoe Lane, where we drank to the Tune of half a Crown, and then we and two others went to the Hay-market, and mist of her there to. But coming back by the End of Sheer-Lane, his Wife called to him, and said, Freeman, here the Bitch is. He came up, and damn you, you Bitch, says he, I have catch'd you now. He had but 15 d. when he went out, and he spent 4 d. at the White-Lion in the Old-Bailey; and when we came to Gale's Sister's, his Wife paid 2s. of the Reckoning, because he had not enough to pay the Whole. And as he was going home, I ask'd his Wife if he had lost 15 s. Damn him, a Son of a Bitch, says she, who would trust him with 15 s. to get drunk with?
Mrs. Wattle. I keep a Coffee-house in Ship-yard by Temple Bar. I was above Stairs when Gale came running up, and shut me in, and cry'd, for God-sake hide me. I was frighted. The Constable, and Freeman and his Wife followed. I ask'd 'em what was the Matter, and if she had robb'd 'em? and Mrs. Freeman said no.
Several other Witnesses swore that Freeman kept a vile House in White-Fryars ; that he said he knew nothing of the Robbery till next Day; and that he offered to make it up for 10 Guineas.
Freeman swore it was all false, and that they offered him 10 Guineas to make it up. The Jury found the Prisoners 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d. each
            .

             in last Year's Session-Paper, Numb. VII. Part I. p. 189.
[The Record was read, and agreed with the Indictment.]
William Plimpton. On the 8th of Sept
. last, the Defendant gave Evidence in this Court against one 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



            , who is since dead.
Court. Was he sworn in the usual Manner?
Plimpton. Yes.
Court. Did you see see him touch the Book?
Plimpton. Yes.
Court. For what was he sworn?
Plimpton. As an Evidence against 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



            .
Court. What was Holms at that time?
Plimpton. A Prisoner at the Bar.
Court. Are you sure the Defendant is the very Person who was then sworn?
Plimpton. Yes.
Court. What Evidence did he give?
Plimpton. He swore that as he was coming from a Place call'd Iron-Gate, by Tower Hill, in his Way as he was going along he lit of this 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



            , and enquir'd of him the way to Bishopsgate-street. That Holms told him, he was going that way, and he would shew him the way. That accordingly Holms led him to a Place call'd Upper-Morefields, near the Booth, or the Wooden-house ; that then the Defendant told Holms, that he need not go any farther, for he then knew where he was, and offer'd Holms a Penny, which he refus'd; that then he offer'd him 2 d. which he likewise refused. That Holms gave a Whistle, and out came a Man unknown to him and clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast; that Holms rifled his Pocket, and took out 5 s. and 9 d. in Money, and a Silver Buckle out of his Shoe.
C. Is this the Evidence that was given?
P. Yes.
C. Was there any thing said as to the Time?
Plimpton. Yes; when the Evidence was gone thro' on Holms's side, the Judge call'd the Defendant up again. And, says the Judge, Harnet, did you ever see that Holms before? Yes, says he, once or twice, my Lord. Where? says my Lord. At the Wrestling. Ring, says he. Then you are sure that's the Man? says my Lord. Yes, I am sure, says he, looking at the Prisoner Holms.
Court. You was saying something about the Time it was done.
Plimpton. The Time was mention'd to be about 10 at Night, within a Quarter over or under, there or thereabouts; that's the Evidence he gave.
Court. Will you ask this Witness any Questions? [To the Defendant.]
D. I gave my Evidence that it was past 10.
C. Now this is said to be all false, the Perjury is assign'd that there was no Robbery.


                  Robert 
                  Plimpton 
               



            , Jun. As the Defendant was coming from Iron-Gate, or Tower-Hill -
C. You should first inform the Court, on what Occasion he gave his Evidence. R. P. Jun. It was on the Trial of Will. Holms for a Robbery. C. Did you hear the Defendant sworn in that Cause? P. Jun. Yes. C. And by whom was he sworn? P. Jun. By the Officer of the Court. C. Did you see him touch the Book? P. Jun. I can't be positive to that. C. What was his Evidence?
P. Jun. He said, that coming from Iron-Gate, he met with 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



            , and ask'd him the way to Bishopsgate-street. That Holms offer'd to show him the way, and took him up and down several Streets, which he did not know the Names of, till he brought him to Upper-Morefields. That when they came there, he offer'd Holms a penny for his Trouble, which he refused. He then offer'd him Two-pence, and Holms also refused that, and after some Dispute, a little Man came up, and clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast, and Holms rifled his Pockets, and took 5 s. 0 d. out, and then took one of his Buckles. That he the Defendant said to Holms, they are not Silver, don't take them; but that Holms swore they were Silver, and he would have them, but Company coming up he got but one. The Defendant was ask'd, how he could be sure that Holms was the Person? and he said, he knew him by the Lights in coming along, and that he had reason to know his Guide. Then he brought Persons to swear what he said when he came home.
C. What did he say as to the time of Night?
P. Jun. He swore it was about 10 a-Clock, and I think he said it was the 19th of July last.
C. How came you both to recollect so particularly, did you take any Notes?
P. Sen. No, I did not.
P. Jun. I did. For Holms, who is now dead, was my Father's Servant, and being in some Trouble on this Account, he sent for my Father, and we went with him before Justice Garret. He was taken up the Day after the Robbery was said to be done.


                  John 
                  Chittham 
               



            . I was in Court at the time of the Trial, and saw the Defendant sworn in the usual Manner; I think I saw him touch the Book. He swore, that he ask'd Holms the way to Bishopsgate-street, that Holms said, he was going that way, and led him to Morefields. That when they came there, he said to Holms, now you may go, for I know my way very well, and then offer'd him first a Penny, and afterwards Two-pence, both which Holms refus'd; and Whistling, a Man came up, and presented a Pistol to him, and Holms rifled his Pocket of 5 s. 9 d. and took a Silver-Buckle out of his Shoe. When he was ask'd, why Holms did not take the other Buckle? He said, My Lord, we heard a Noise, and he run one way, and I another. He said, he was positive to the Man, by his black bushy Hair. His Lordship ask'd him, How he knew? And he answer'd, By the Lights as they came along together.
Court. What Day did they say it was?
Chittham. To the best of my Knowledge the 19th of July, near or about 10 at Night.
Court. Now you may call your Witnesses to prove the Evidence on which Holms was acquitted. James Towers! What have you to say against the Defendant?


                  James 
                  Towers 
               



            . I was Father in Law to 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



             deceas'd. He was try'd here last Sessions but one, on the Evidence of the Defendant.

Court. For what?
Towers. For robbing him in More-fields.
C. I would ask all the Witnesses if the Defendant was positive to the Day and Hour?
All. Yes.
Towers. On the Day that the Defendant swore the Robbery was committed, which was the 19th of July, as I came from my Work, near Eight at Night, I met 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



             in Bishopsgate-street, at the Corner of Old-Bedlam ; says I, Where are you going, Will? And says he, To see for you; Mr. King has got a Shoulder of Mutton, desires you and I, and my Wife and Sister, to come to Supper with him to Night. I did not much care for going, and so I went on towards Holm's-House, which is in Old-Bedlam-Court, and he turned back and went with me. When he came home, he said to his Wife, Sarah ! come prithee get ready, Mr. King's Supper waits. Says she, Won't my Father go? Will, says I, to oblige you I will, and so he and I went before, about 8, and his Wife and Sister came after. We stay'd there with him till 11.
Court. Are you sure he did not go out in all that time?
Towers. I don't know that he was out of the Room. He might go out to make Water, but I am sure he was not out 5 Minutes.
Court. Are you positive that he was not out so long as to go to Upper-Morefields and back again?
Towers. That I am. I went home with him when the Company broke up. His Sister took hold of his Arm, and his Wife of mine. I saw him partly undrest, in order to go to Bed before I left him, and then it was half an Hour past a 11. Next Day, being the 20th of July, after I had done work, I went to drink a Pint of Beer at an Alehouse in Houndsditch. A Messenger came there, and told me, that my Son Holms was got into Trouble, and was at the Flying-Horse in Morefields. I wonder'd to hear it, because I knew he was not Quarrelsome; so I went thither, and found him sitting in a Box. What's the Matter? says I. Why, says he, Here's a Villain accuses me of Robbing him last Night. Robbing him? says I. Yes, says Holms, and has put a Buckle into my Pocket. Well, says I, we can prove where you was last Night. I'll go and fetch some of the People that were with us. I went out and met Mr. Plimpton and his Son.
Court. What Company had you at Supper at King's ?
Towers. Holms and I went first, as I said, about 8. His Wife Sarah and his Sister Susan came about 9. Then there was 
               
                  Thomas 
                  King 
               



            , the Man of the House, and his Wife 
               
                  Giles 
                  King 
               



            , and 
               
                  Johana 
                  Maxey 
               



            . So meeting with Mr. Plimpton, I went back with him to the Flying-Horse, and Holms told him the same Story as he had told me; that the Villain had charg'd him with a Robbery, and had put a Buckle in his Pocket. His Master desir'd they might go before a Justice; I think 't was Justice Chamberlain's we went to; but he was not at home, and going from his Door the Constable and Holms cross'd Spittle-Yard in order to go to Justice Garret's, when I observ'd the Defendant, who was behind them, turn'd towards Bishopsgate-street, as if he was going off. I can't swear that that was his Design; but I believe he was sorry for what he had done, and was afraid to proceed. But I went behind him, and then he followed them ; and I desired the Constable to take Care of him. The Defendant finding such a favourable Reception at Justice Garret's, he swore the Robbery, or else I believe he would not have had the Impudence to have done it.


                  Thomas 
                  King 
               



            . 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



             and his Father-in-Law came to my House, on the 19th of July in the Evening: It was a little turn'd of 8, and in a little time, about 9, his Wife and Sister came, and they all staid till 11 at Night, and then all went away together. I don't know that he went out of the Room till the Company broke up: But I am sure he was not absent so long as to go to Moorfields. I took Notice of the Day of the Month, because next Day he was charged with the Robbery.
Defendant. There was no Talk of his Wife being there when you gave your Evidence at his Trial.
King. What's the matter there was not?
Court. You must give him a fair Answer.
King. I gave the same Evidence then, and could not say otherwise, for I should have been wrong if I had.
Defendant. You gave no Evidence of his Wife then.
Court. He swears now positively, that he swore then that they came at different Times. If you can contradict him by other Evidence you may.

Defendant. I have no Council.
Court. The Court is Council for you.


                  Susan 
                  Holms 
               



            . My Brother 
               
                  William 
                  Holms 
               



            , and his Father, went to Mr. King's in Petticoat-lane, the 19th of July, about 8 in the Evening, and his Wife and I followed, and it was hardly then 9.
Court. Did you find Holms there?
S. H. Yes, and we all staid till 11 or after, and I believe he never moved from his Seat in all the time. He was not missing a Minute to my Knowledge.
Court. Then you are sure he was not absent long enough to go to Moorfields?
S. H. I am positive to that.
C. How came you to remember the Day of the Month?
S. H. I took notice of it because he was taken up next Day.
C. What had you for Supper?
S. H. A Shoulder of Mutton and Cucumbers.
C. What Company supt there?
S. H. Mr. King and his Wife Giles, my Brother Holms and his Father, my Brother's Wife and I, and Mrs. Maxey [Maxstead]; my Brother and I, and his Wife, and his Father, went home together; and I saw my Brother and his Wife abed, and I don't know but they might be asleep before I left him.
C. Who is Mrs. Maxey ?
S. H. One that lived in the same House where we supt.
Def. You gave no Account of her in Holms's Trial.
S. H. She was here then, but there was no Occasion to call her.


                  Giles 
                  King 
               



            . I dress'd the Supper. Holms and his Father came to my Room between 8 and 9 on the 19th of July, and his Wife and Sister followed, in about half an Hour. He staid all the time. I never saw him go out of the Room; for I never left the Room my self, but my Husband went out and in to fetch Drink.


                  Sarah 
                  Holms 
               



            . My Husband and -
Court. Was Wil. Holms your Husband?


                  Sarah
                   H. Yes
               



            .
Court. I believe there will be Proof enough without you, tho' otherwise ( as your Husband is dead) I think you might be admitted to give Evidence. But as there seems to be no Occasion for it at present, you had better stand aside a little, for I would not willingly na the least matter of Doubt with unexceptionable Evidence.


                  John 
                  Yates 
               



            . I was drinking at Mr. Hoare's (the Constable's) at the Flying-horse in Moorfields. The Defendant came and told Mr. Hoare that he had seen a Man at the wrestling Ring who had robb'd him the Night before. Mr. Hoare call'd me to assist him. We went out together, and the Defendant told us we should find the Goods upon the Man, and desired us to stand off a little, while he went to the Ring and look'd for the Man. We staid about a quarter of an Hour, and Mr. Hoare being tired with waiting, sent me to see for the Defendant. The Defendant seeing me coming towards him, came and met me, and said, stay a little, the Man is there, and I see the Buckle upon him. I went back to Mr. Hoare, and presently the Defendant called us, and going up to Holms, he tapt him on the Shoulder, and said, This is the Man. We went to the King's Head Tavern, and the Defendant bid me search Holms. I search'd his left Coat Pocket, and found nothing; but the Constable searching the other, pull'd out a Buckle: The Defendant presently cry'd, that's my Buckle, and here's the Fellow to it: With that Holms said, then somebody put it in. We went to one Justice, but he was not at home, and so went again to Mr. Hoare's House, and he charg'd another Man to take care of Holms. So that I being no farther concerned, did not know when they went before the Justice again. By the Defendant's saying he saw the Buckle upon him, I thought it had been a Girdle-Buckle, till I saw it was a Shoe-Buckle.
Court. Did you see nothing else taken out of Holms's Pocket? Yates. Nothing, except it was 2 or 3 Goosberries. Dif. Did I ever tell you that I saw the Buckle upon him? Yates. Yes, those were your very Words. Def. I had no Discourse with you alone.


                  George 
                  Quarrel 
               



            . I was coming over Moorfields the 19th of July at Night, and about the Middle of the Tenter-ground, I saw the Prisoner standing stock still, and 2 Gentlemen coming by, he ask'd them what was o'Clock; they answer'd him roughly ; and I coming up, told him it had just struck 10. He said he did not want to know, but only asked for his Fancy. Then he and I walking one Way, he told me he had been robb'd; and coming

to a House in Long-Lane [Long-Alley] he stopt, and told me that was his Lodging, and would needs have me go in. I was afraid he intended to charge me with the Robbery: But however I went in with him. He ask'd me my Name, and where I liv'd. I told him, and he set it down. Then he ask'd if I'd drink a Dram. I said yes. We had a Quartern, and he put his Hand in his Fob and took out half a Crown and some Shillings and Half-pence, and paid the Reckoning. I was in a sort of a Wonder how that Money escaped; but he said his Breeches buttoir'd tight, so that the Man who robb'd him could not find it.
Court. Did he appear under my Confusion?
Quarrel. He seemed to be frighted?
Court. You say he asked what was a Clock, and then told you it was only for his Fancy; did that look-like one that had been just robb'd?
Quarrel. I am not so good a Judge of that as your Lordship.
Def. Was it proper for me to tell you why I ask'd? You told me that I had been at your House with two Women.
Quarrel. That was when I came to your Lodging, not when I met you first.
Def. Did not you say in Moorfields, that a Fellow rushed after you, and whistled, and that you suspected somebody had been robb'd?
Quarrel. No. Def. You knew me first when we met. Quar. I never knew you, till I came to your Lodging.
Court. Had he been at your House with two Women?
Quar. Yes, a few Days before.
Def. I have met with a great deal of Trouble in a strange Place, and it is not to be expected that I should bring Witnesses from Ireland, from whence I lately came, and where my Friends live; but I have a Certificate here from the Mayor of Cork and other Gentlemen.
Court. The Court cannot read it; such Certificates may be procured in a very odd manner.
Def. I had no Money to subpoena Witnesses to prove it. Here are nothing but Circumstances against me; and I declare now, (tho' a Man may be mistaken) that he actually robb'd me, and I would say the same, if it was my dying Day.
The Jury found him 

               guilty
            .

            , for robbing Arthur Murphy on the Highway, vide Sessions Paper, Numb. 1. p. 5.
Edward Gouge. I dined in Bloomsbury-Square, and staid there till between 2 and 3 in the Morning, and then going home I met the Prisoner in Drury-Lane


 ; she challenged me by Name, and said I knew her and her Mother; this being just by a Brandy Shop, says I, let's go in, that I may see who you are. I sat down there, and pulled out my Watch, to see what o'Clock it was, and when I had staid some time I went away; I had not been gone above three Minutes before I mist my Watch, upon which I went back to the Shop, but she was gone. I asked the Man of the House if he knew her, he said yes; I bid him look for her, and if he could get my Watch again I would give him a Guinea.
Prisoner. When the Linkmen came into Mr. Puddington's Brandy Shop and attacked you, did not you take out your Watch, and did not I bid you take Care of it, and did not you then put it into my Hand?
Gouge. Not that I know of.
Prisoner. You did, as God is my Judge; but you was so drunk that you was hardly sensible, you called for 6 half Pints of Gin, and paid Puddington 2 s. for it.
Gouge. I was in Liquor I own.
Court. It may be necessary to ask you to what Degree, are you sure you was so far sensible as to be now capable of giving an Account of what you did then?
Gouge. I remember my sitting by Paddington, and giving him Liquor, and that when I went out I consider'd what Company I had been in, and thereupon felt for my Watch, and mist it.

            , Headborough of St. Giles's. I went to the Round-house between 3 and 4 o' Sunday Morning, the 24th of December. The Prisoner was there, and I heard she had been stripp'd naked, to search for a Gold-Watch that had been stolen from a Gentleman; but to no Purpose. Puddington being there too, he said he had some Reason to suspect she had put it in a private Place, and upon hearing that, she presently shew'd me the Place he spoke of, and bid us search and welcome. He and I refused, but

                  Haselden 
               



             (the Governor of the Round-house) undertook it, and after a little Examination, he produced the Watch.
Prisoner. I put it there to preserve it for the Gentleman, for fear my Husband should find it, and take it from me; for I did not think Puddington a proper Man to trust it with.

            . The Prosecutor and Prisoner came into my Shop between 2 and 3 in the Morning, they staid there about 2 hours, and then he went out and she after him; he returned in 4 or 5 Minutes, and asked for her. I told him she was gone, but I knew where she liv'd, and would endeavour to find her out ; I found her in her Room up two pair of Stairs, and had her before Justice Mercer; she deny'd that she had any Watch. The Justice sent for the Governor of the Round-House, whose Son came, and we conducted her to the Round-House, where she stripp'd herself to be search'd, but we found nothing upon her, and so she put on her Clothes again. I went out, but before I had gone far, I recollected that as we went along with her from the Justice's to the Round-House, I had seen her stooping forward, and poking with her Right-hand in her Pocket thus - and with her Left-hand a good deal lower thus - so I went back, and said, Bab, you have certainly got this Watch about you. Where have I got it? Says she. I told her in what Place. Why then, says she, as you are a married Man, you may search; and with that as she sat in the Chair, she parted her Feet, and remov'd the Covering, I refus'd to search, and so did Mr. Cross; but we told the Governor it was his Business, and at last he agreed to do it. When she found we were come to a Resolution, she made some Resistance; but I and Mr. Cross kept her Feet in a proper Situation, while the Governor examin'd the Premises; after some search he call'd out, and told us, that he had got hold of the Chain at last; but says he, I had much ado to reach it, and with that he drew the Watch out, and in a sad Condition it was; we cleansed it, and carried it to the Gentleman, who own'd it to be his; and then it was carry'd before the Justice, by whom it was seal'd up, and now we have it here.
Prisoner. Was I deny'd to you when you came to my Lodging to enquire for me?
Puddington. No; but you deny'd having the Watch.
Prisoner. He and Cross fought about the Guinea they were to have for taking me up. This Fellow, my Lord, goes by the Name of Lawyer Puddington, the Law-splitter. He would swear this Candlestick was a Ha'penny Roll if he could get a Farthing by it. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

Prisoner. I hope they have not made it appear that I stole the Stockings.
Court. Something very like it. The Goods were found in your Possession.
Prisoner. I once had the Honour to be called an Attorney
 of the King's-Bench, I was sworn in, and I am sure I paid for it; but I have met with Vicissitudes in Life, as any Man may.
Court. Are you a wholesale Dealer in Stockings too? How came you by those Goods?

Eliz. Skinner. When I came back I met the Prisoner coming out of the Shop with the Stockings and Petticoat, I push'd him in again, and he drop'd the Goods at his Feet.

Dawson. If you saw us run, why did you not run after us your self?
Wheatly. Because there was no Body in our Shop

            . I and the Prisoner went out a thieving together. We used to meet at one Howard's House in Baldwin's Gardens, where we used to sell the Goods we stole; and Howard and his Wife are now in Hold for buying stolen Goods. We met at Howard's between 4 and 5 in the Evening, and went from thence to Mr. Hodges's Shop, where we saw the Footman hang on one Door, and go backwards for the other, and then Dawson went in and got the Goods, while we stood to watch. We run down St. Martin's, where we lost Dawson, but we met him again at Howard's. We sold 'em all to Howard's Wife for 22 s. She gave us 12 s. that Night, and 10 s. next Morning. We shared the Money, and had 7 s. 4 d. a-piece.
Mr. Hodges. The Goods cost me 4 l. 6 s. Dawson says he is but 14 Years old, but by the Parish Books of St. Martin's, it appears he's above 17. The Jury found Dawson 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

John Davis. About 6 at Night I met the Prisoner in White-lion Street, by the Seven Dials. She ask'd me to drink a Dram, and I went with her to Mrs. Young's, a Chandler's Shop, and we had a Quartern and a half of Brandy in a Back-Room by our selves; I pulled out my Watch to see what a Clock it was, and put it up again; she ask'd me for a Shilling upon the Account of - but I did nothing with her. She went away before me, and I staying to count my Money miss'd my Watch. I describ'd her to the People of the House, and they said they knew her, but could not tell where she liv'd. They sent for me next Day, and I found the Prisoner and her Husband there, and they abused me barbarously.
Court. 'Twas well he did not speak with you for having a Correspondence with his Wife.
Constable. She own'd to me that she had the Watch, and had given it to her Husband, to pawn for 30 s. He was taken up for two or three Assaults, and is now in Bridewell - He had beat the Prosecutor, and made him all over bloody.
Prisoner. He pick'd up two Women, and lay with them two Nights, at Moll Adams's in Newtoner's Lane.
Davis. It's true, I was with Clarety-Face Hannah, and another Woman, but that was after I lost my Watch - I had nothing to do with them; I only went to them to enquire after the Prisoner.
Prisoner. They were his old Companions, for when he pick'd me up, he ask'd me, if I knew Clarety-Face Hannah in Castle-Court, and he told me, he used to go to her. He and I had two hot Pots, and two Quarterns of Brandy together; and he offer'd me first Six-pence and then a Shilling, and then he gave me Three-pence more, and, says I, what must I do for this Money? Why, says he, 'tis to let me - . The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

             had been my Servant
 2 or 3 Years. I lost a great many Goods in that Time; but did not suspect him, for I took him to be very honest. I have laid no more to his Charge in the Indictment, than what I found again at his Lodging in Honey-Lane Market, and at other Places, and what I have here to produce. When these Goods were restored to me, I compared several of the Quantities with the Pieces I had from whence they were cut, and they tallied. This Piece of White Mantua Silk in particular, has his own Mark of 36 half Yards on it, and-this, with the Piece I have at home, from whence it was parted, makes exactly that Measure; here are 49 Quantities cut off, which make 169 Yards in all, which we have put up in 7 Parcels, seal'd and mark'd; 5 of these Parcels I swear to, but the other 2, my Partner knows better than I.
Richard Manning. I keep the Sign of the Carpenter and Weavers Arms, in Honey-Lane Market, the Weavers use my House to sell their Goods to other Weavers and Macklers, and I have a great many Warehouses on purpose to lay their Goods in; a Porter having at several Times brought several Parcels for the Prisoner - , to dispose of, I at last open'd some of them, and found them not to be whole Pieces nor Remnants, but Quantities cut off, which gave me some Suspicion. I shew'd them to several Weavers, who believ'd, with me, that they were stolen; upon which, I order'd my Boy (next time the Porter came) to dog him. The Boy did, and told me, that he follow'd the Porter to Mr. Biard's, at the Queen's-Arms, on Ludgate-Hill; I went to Mr. Biard's, and and told him, that his Porter had brought 9 Pieces of Silk to my House that Day for - . Mr. Biard came to my House, but did not own any of the Goods; however, he took one Piece of Cloth-colour'd Mantua, and went with me to several Mercers Shops, and at last matched it at Mr. Adams's. The Prisoner Fowl was not then within, but he came while we staid. He was charged with the Fact, and confess'd that he sent those and a great many other Goods by the Porter to my House for Mr. - . I met with - , and said to him, How came you to take such cut Goods from a Servant? You could not think he came honestly by them; I believe I have had as many left for you as came to 1000 l. It's no such Thing, says he, for I never paid Fowl above 100 l. for what I have had of him.
Court. What Business does - follow?
Manning. He's a Mackler -  one that sells Goods for the Weavers; and sometimes he makes Goods himself.
Court. Is it not usual for Macklers to sell for Mercers as well as Weavers?
Manning. No.
Court. He own'd, you say, that he had the Goods from Fowl; did he say any thing how Fowl came by them?
Manning. He told me that Fowl said he had them at a Sale.

                  Biard 
               



            , Porter. Fowl has given me, I believe, 10 Parcels, to carry to Mr. Manning's for Mr. - . They were ty'd up handsomely, like whole Pieces, but I never saw them open, and so can't swear to them.
Mr. Maynard. Mr. Manning charged me with - , and then we went to Fowl's Lodgings, and there, in his Burean, found these 49 Pieces; this Parcel was taken out of - Cupboard, which he rents in Mr. Manning's House. This Parcel we found at Mr. Bullock's a Piece-Broker, at the Black-Raven behind St. Clement's, and this other at Mr. Waters's, at the White-Swan, in the same Street.
Bullock and Waters own'd they had such Goods of - , and said, it was as usual for the Piece-Brokers to buy such Pieces of the Macklers, as of the Weavers.


                  George 
                  Fothergill 
               



            . We found these Goods in Fowl's Lodging, and - directed us to Bullock's and Waters's, where we found these other 2 Parcels, which I swear to be mine.

                  Edwards 
               



            . Fowl serv'd his Time with me, and afterwards set up for himself, but met with Misfortunes. I always thought him honest, and was surpriz'd when I heard this of him.
Several Witnesses appear'd for - , they gave him, in general, a good Character, and said, it belong'd to his Business to sell Remnants, as well as whole Pieces. But being ask'd, if one who they knew to be a Mercer's Man, had brought them Parcels which were not Remnants, but Quantities cut off of whole Pieces, whether they should not have had some Suspicion that he did not come honestly by them? They said, Yes.
One Evidence depos'd, that being at - House, she heard Fowl tell him, there was to be a Sale next Week. And, another (a Velvet Weaver) that sometimes, in making a large Piece of Velvet, they happen to make a Hole in it, in which Case it was common for them to tear it off, and give it to the Macklers to sell, because the Mercers would oblige them to make too large Abatements for such Faults in their Work. The Jury found the Prisoners 

               Guilty

            . I am Servant to Mess. Trueman. On the 21st of Jan. I miss'd 3 Iron Pins and Chains belonging to the Drays, we have lost 16 within these 3 Weeks.
William Hill, Watchman. Between 3 and 4 on Sunday Morning, as I was beating the Hour in Booth-street, (facing Princes-street) in Spittle-Fields, I heard a sort of a clinking, and looking about (for it was Moon-light) I saw a Man stooping down, and seemingly very busy about something, but as I made towards him he brushed off; this must be some Rogue, thought I to myself, and if I should run after him, 'tis ten to one if I catch him. So I made as if I had not seen him, and knock'd the Hour as if I was going my Rounds, and then hid my Lanthorn under my Coat, and stood out of Sight. Presently my Gentleman came back, and out I pops upon him, and now says I, Tho' you're the Devil I'll see who you be. Why so you may, Mr. Hill, says he, (for be gave me the Title of a Gentleman) What, is it you, Tom? says I, if I did not know you I wou'd carry you before the Officer of the Night. But what made you shun me ? Why, says he, I had a mind to play the Pool with that Woman; for there was a Man and a Woman standing together in the Street hard by. Now I always take it for a Rule, that wherever there's a Woman, there's Mischief.
Court. Did you find any Goods upon him?
Hill. Yes, I found 3 Dray-pins with the Chains, in his Apron.
Court. Are you sure the Prisoner is the same Man?
Hill. The Prisoner? No, I know nothing of the Prisoner.
Court. Why, of whom have you been telling this long Story?
Hill. Of one 
               
                  Tom 
                  Robinson 
               



            , that I have known from a Boy; here he stands.


                  Thomas 
                  Robinson 
               



            . On the 14th of Jan. I met the Prisoner, and says he, Tom, if you'll go with me I can take off some Pins? So we went to Trueman's Brew-house, and he ring'd [wrung] off 4, and we sold them to a Smith in Gravel-Lane for a Penny a Pound, and on the 26th of January we took 3 more.
Court. Are you sure it was the 26th?
Robinson. I think so, but I know it was late on Saturday Night, and the Watchman stopt me with them between 2 and 3 on Sunday Morning, and the Prisoner then stood behind me, and there was another Man and Woman in the Street.
Hill. I saw none but Robinson and that Man and Woman.
Court. What Trade are you, Robinson?
R. A Weaver, but I have work'd 12 Years with Mr. Coker at the Turnpike.
Court. And what Business does the Prisoner follow?
R. He drives Beasts and does labouring Work; he lives in Nagshead-Alley in Winfred-street, Spittle-Fields. I have been acquainted with him but 3 Weeks.
Court. Was it a dark or light Night when you was taken?
R. I don't remember.

Prisoner. He swears I was out with him till 3 in the Morning, which I never was in my Life, for whenever we went out to wring Pins, we always got 'em and sold 'em long before that time.

            . As I was standing in Mrs. Wells's, (a Cook's) Shop in Leadenhall-street


, I heard a Pane of Glass broke, and looking out, I perceived it was the Prosecutor's Window, which is opposite to Mrs. Wells's, and I saw the Prisoner go into the Three Kings Entry which is close by. I did not then suspect them to be Rogues, but thought they had broke the Glass by Mischance. But while I was looking, Walter came out, and putting his Hand in at the broken Pane, took out a Piece of Sarcenet, and went again into the Entry: Then the other Prisoner took out something else, I think it was a Pair of Stockings, and went after Walter; in a little Time they both came out again, Hastings with a Pair of white Stockings in his Hands, and Walter with the Sarcenet in his Apron. Walter came up toward where I stood, and Mrs. Wells took him by the Collar, and pulled him into her Shop; he said, he had found the Silk. Another pursued Hastings, and took him. As we were carrying them before a Justice, Hastings threw something into a Shop Window; we look'd and found a Pair of white Stockings, and the other Pair was found upon Walter, when he was search'd before the Justice.

Walter took out a Piece of Silk, and wrap'd it in his Apron, and as he was coming along towards my Door, I stopp'd him, and pull'd him into my Shop; he pretended he had found the Silk, and offer'd to leave it with me, if I would let him go.
Constable. I found one Pair of Stockings on Walter.

, the Goods were in a Back-Parlour; there's an Entry goes from the Street Door, to that Parlour. I suppose the Street Door was open, but the Parlour Door was lock'd. About 9 at Night, as we were going to Bed, we saw the Parlour Door was broke open, and presently miss'd the Goods.

Court. The Kitchen Door?
Powers. I suppose it was the Kitchen, because it was upon the Ground Floor, and we went a good Way down an Entry; I am sure it was a Back-Room, but I don't know what Name they may call it by. So when we came to the Door, says the Prisoner, this Lock will fly, and with that he burst it open.
Prisoner. Where did we meet that Night?
Powers. At Mr. Dacres's House.
Dacres. I don't remember that I saw Norman there.
Powers. Mr. Dacres's Maid knows of our being there.
Maid. I don't remember that I saw them together. About a Fortnight after Christmas, I saw the Prisoner at our Door talking with my Sister, but Powers was not there then.
Prisoner. Two Years ago this Person was taken up for ing of Money out of People and he has been out of Jail but 3 Months and yet he has got 18 Robberies in his Information: Is it likely he could be concerned in so many Facts, and have so many Accomplices in so short a Time? He has put a great many innocent Men, besides me, in his Information. never drank but twice with him in my Life.
Court. Has not the Prisoner been an Evidence himself?
A Turnkey. Yes, my Lord, he was an Evidence last Summer against* 5 young Fellows, who were all capitally convicted, but were afterwards transported.

            . Tredwell was my Servant
, on Sunday Evening I sent him of an Errand, he return'd in pretty good Time, and after Supper I sent him out again, but he came back no more. When it grew late I began to be uneasy, because my Husband was out of Town. I look'd about, and mist a Salt and four Spoons. On Tuesday Morning following, the Prisoner sent Word to his Sister to come to him at an Alehouse in Chick-Lane, so he was taken and brought to me. He seem'd very much troubled, and lamented sadly; Madam, says he, that Night you sent me out, as I went by St. Sepulcher's Church-wall, I met with a Woman that has been my Ruin: She said, my Lad, will you give me a Quartern of Gin? I told her I had no Money. No! says she, you don't look like one that wanted Money; where do ye live? I told her with Mr. Harris in Warwick-lane, Can't you rob the House? says she; sure you may steal something or other, and let it be what it will, the People of the House where I live will receive it of ye. Then, Madam, this Creature came with me to your Door, and would fain have had me let her in, but I was afraid to do that, and so she waited for me in the Alley. I took an Opportunity of slipping the four Spoons and Salt into my Pocket, and when you sent me out again, I went with this Woman to her Lodgings at William Grone's in Bishop's-Court in the Little Old-Baily. There I treated her with two Quarterns of Cherry Brandy, and then the Woman of the House (Crone's Wife) said, if I intended to lye there all Night, one of her Girls must lye out of her Bed, and therefore I must give her Half a Crown to get her another Lodging. I gave one of the Spoons to the Woman that pick'd me up, and when Crone came home next Morning, they wanted their Reckoning, and Crone said he would dispose of the Plate for me, but I must give him a Crown for his Day's Work: So he and his Wife went out and pawn'd the Spoons for 35 s. but Crone kept the Salt himself, and he gave me but 9 s. out of the 35, and let me stay in the House till I had spent 8, and then they turn'd me out of Doors.
Court. What Tredwell confess'd may affect himself, but is no Evidence against Crone. Did you hear Crone confess any thing?
Mrs. Harris. Yes; he said when he came home on Sunday Night his Wife told him, that Madam had got a Spoon of the Gentleman's, and would not give it him; upon which, says Crone, I said to Madam, Damn ye, no Gentleman shall be affronted in my House, and my Wife shall have the Spoon. I told Crone, he must needs think the Spoons were stolen. I vow to God, Madam, says he, I thought the Fellow look'd like an honest Fellow. I own my Wife keeps an ill House, but I can't help it, she'll cut my Throat if I don't submit to her, for she is worth Money.
Mr. Lambkin. Crone and his Wife came together to my House, and pawn'd the Spoons for 35 s. she told me while I stood by, that they were her t'other Husband's Spoons.
Constable. Crone own'd to me that he pawn'd the Spoons at Lambkin's.
Crone. I own that I had the Salt and pawn'd the Spoons, and Tredwell gave 'em me to pawn to discharge his Reckoning, for he had run up 26 s. that Night and the next Morning.
Tredwell. I own I took the Things, but I was enticed to it by the Woman that lodges at Crone's. I never was guilty of any such Fact before I gave Crone the Spoons and Salt to pawn, and he pretended to me that he pawn'd 'em all for 35 s. but he afterwards confess'd that he pawn'd only the Spoons for so much, and kept the Salt himself.
Two or three Witnesses appear'd to Crone's Character. They swore he was a very honest Man and kept a Bawdy House, and they never heard any thing amiss of him.
The Jury found Tredwell 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.
             and Crone 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

Compton Morris. The Prisoner came to my Shop for a Quarter of a Yard of printed Linen, for Robings, which she bought, and paid me 6 d. for. I had another Customer in the Shop, and a pretty many Goods lay tumbled on the Counter. I observ'd the Prisoner to be very busy about those Goods, and as she was going out, I suspected she had taken more than she should, and so I call'd her to come back, and said, Hussy, you have stolen something; but she ran away, and I jump'd over the Counter, and follow'd her. I came up with her at the Sun Tavern Door, and took her by the Collar, upon which she threw this Linen from under her Coats, and it fell upon the Threshold. We have been so pester'd with these Vermin in our Shops, that I vow and protest, there's no living for them, I have lost above ten Pounds by them since last Month. The Prisoner had been in my Shop before this time.

John Crow. I live in Cary-street, Westminster


. The Prisoner had been my Servant
 8 or 9 Days, and went away on the 14th of June last, in order to go for a Month to see her Friends in Shropshire. My House was robbed in the Night between the 22d and 23d of June, but none of the outward Part of my House being broken, I imagin'd that the Person who robb'd me had got in, in the Evening, and lay conceal'd till I and my Family were a bed, and then committed the Fact, and went out at the Door, for the Door was found a jar in the Morning. I had some Suspicion of the Prisoner, because she was seen in the Neighbourhood the Day before, and was well acquainted with my House. Upon which I went to her Lodging, and heard that she did not lie there that Night as I was robb'd. On the 28th of September I went after her to Shrewsbury, and -
Court. Why did you stay so long before you pursued her?
Crow. Because I expected her up again in a Month, and so thought to have saved that Trouble and Charge; but hearing she had taken a House at Oswistry in Shropshire, in order to settle there, I went, as I was saying, to Shrewsbury, where I got a Warrant to search her House. When I came thither, I found her at Home, and as soon as she saw me, she open'd a Chest, and took out a Pair of Stays that I had lost, and gave 'em to me. Jenny, says I, Where's your Mistress's Cloak and Hat? She said she'd fetch them; and so she did. And then she took the Tea-Spoons and Tongs out of the Chest, but told me, they were none of mine. I believe they were the same that I lost; but I can't swear to them, because they were not mark'd. I charg'd her with stealing these, and other Goods from me; but she said, those Goods and 20 l. were given her, by the Person who did the Robbery, that she might not discover it, and that she had nothing that belong'd to me, but what she had return'd to me; but next Day (Sept. 29.) when she was carry'd before the Justice, she said, she had bought the Goods; and her Father and Brother coming to intercede for her, I shew'd them a List of what I had lost, and ask'd them, if they knew any thing of those Goods? They said, Yes; and (while her Father staid) her Brother went and fetch'd my Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches, and she said, she bought them too.

                  Crow 
               



            . The Prisoner went from me June 14, and came on Wednesday, June 21, to take her Leave of me, and said, she must lye that Night in the City, near the Inn from whence she was to go with the Carrier, that she might be ready in the Morning, but she was seen in my Neighbourhood all the next Day; I was robbed that Night, and we went out of Town next Morning.


                  Sarah 
                  Corbet 
               



            . I am the Prisoner's Half-Sister, and being to go down with her into the Country, she agreed to come and lye with me at my Lodging the Night before she went; but she did not come till 4 o'Clock in the Morning, and then she hurry'd me to get up and go to the Inn, tho' I told her, the Pack-Horses did not go out till Two in the Afternoon; she had carried her Box before to the Inn.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Grimston 
               



            , I live in White's-Alley, Mrs. Corbet lodg'd with me, and the Prisoner bid me tell her that she would come to her by Five in the Evening, but she did not come till Four in the Morning, and between 5 and 6, she and her Sister Corbet, went out and took Coach in Chancery-Lane to go to the Inn.


                  John 
                  Warle 
               



            . I lodg'd at the Prosecutor's. On Thursday the 22d of June, my Maid let me in about 11 at Night: I told her, I suppos'd Mr. Crow and his Wife were gone to Bed, because I saw a Light in their Chamber; and therefore, I bid her fasten the Door, and I staid in the Entry while she did it.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Gilby 
               



            . Yes, I lock'd the Door and bolted it.

            , the Prosecutor's Servant. I came down first on Friday Morning (June 23,) and found the Street Door standing a-jar.
The Prisoner in her Defence, pretended that her Master (the Prosecutor) had given her the Goods to lye with her, and that she had miscarried by him. The Jury 


               acquited her of the Burglary, and found her guilty of the Felony only
            .

As soon as he perceiv'd me, he took to his Heels, and I ran after him. He threw away the Bar, and ran by the Duke of Argyle's down King-street; I cry'd out, stop Thief, he got past the first Watch, but was stopt by another Watch, and he was not out of my Sight till he was taken. The Moon was up, but it was a little cloudy, though not so much but I could see him.

            , Watchman. As I called Two o'Clock in Marlborough-street, I found a Bar of some Pallisades bent, and looking farther I found another in the same Condition. Upon this I thought there was some Roguery going forward; so I planted my Lanthern in the middle of Blenheim-street, that my Inhabitants might see I was upon my Duty, and then I went aside and stood upon the Watch, and presently I heard a cry of stop Thief. Says I to my Brother Watch, do you go down Tyler-street, and I'll go down Little Marlborough-street, and so we did. I met the Prisoner running with his drawn Sword (for he is a Soldier) and I knocked him down. My Liberty has lately been very much robbed, which is a sign that it is pestered with Rogues; I have lost a great deal of ron and Lead - not that it was my own, but my inhabitants; and as several Attempts have been made, they had lost a great deal more if it had not been for the Care of the Watch, which is a Sign that the Watch have not neglected their Duty; and if the Watch should sink, by consequence my Inhabitants cannot stand. And therefore, pray, my Lord, stand by the Watch whatever you do, or else my People will be undone; they will be robbed, and have their Throats cut, and their Houses burnt about their Ears. The Prisoner has threatened to be even with the Watch, but he did not say which of them; therefore, I hope, the Watch will be protected. When I knocked the Prisoner down, he reeled six Yards before he sell, and then he said I had killed him.
Luke - Watchman. I heard a cry of stop Thief, and met the Prisoner running with his drawn Sword; I made a blow at him, but he put it by with his Sword; I called out to

, March 31

George Binnington. On Saturday last I went with my Fellow-Servants to see Chelsea Hospital, and coming back in the Evening we went into a House to drink; the Prisoner and another Woman were at the Door, and they went up with us without asking.
Court. You were glad of their Company however?


                  George 
                  Binnington 
               



            . Yes, to my Sorrow; we drank a Glass of Ale together, and I must needs own we were very busy and familiar. The Prisoner led me to the Bed-side, and leading me to the Bed-side, I tumbled her upon the Bed; and tumbling her upon the Bed, I felt her Hand at my Fob Pocket; and feeling her Hand at my Fob Pocket, I got up; and getting up, I declared that she had stole 7 Guineas from me. Upon this the other Woman asked me, what Present I would make her if she got me my Money again? I offer'd a Crown, she puffed at that; I bid her 10 s. but that would not do neither; then I said I would take 6 Guineas for the whole. No, the Prisoner said, if I would take five Guineas, and be easy, I should have them, and so she put five Guineas into my Hand, and putting them into my Hand the Constable came up that moment; (for I sent for a Constable when I miss'd my Money) and the Constable coming up, he carried her before his Majesty the Justice.
Court. Was the Money in a Purse, or loose in your Pocket?
G. B. It was in a Purse, but she had taken the Gold out of the Purse, and was putting the Purse into my Fob again; for when I felt her it was half in and half out.
A Juryman. Were your Breeches up or down when you lost the Money?
G. B. I must acknowledge my Breeches were loose, an't please you.
Prisoner. Where was the other Woman when we were tumbling upon the Bed?
G. B. At the Door with my Fellow-Servant.
P. Was not she at the Bed-side?
G. B. She did come to the Bed-side indeed, but not upon the Bed.
P. Did not you shove me up Stairs?
G. B. I did not shove her, nor touch her, till she came into the Room.
P. Was you drunk or sober?
G. B. Very sober.
P. You swear this against me because I would not comply with all your Humours, but you gave the other Woman a Note, and conveyed her away, because she did any thing that you desired her.
G. B. There was a little Writing indeed, but that was before I got any of my Money again; my Fellow-Servant wrote it, to signify, that if the Prisoner would return us so much we would acquit her, but she did not dissolve to give me the money then, and so the Note was riven, and I sent for a Constable; the other Woman got away while we were bargaining.
P. No, they let her go, because they had carnal Dealings with her, and they would have been concerned with me in the same way, but I said I would not do any such Thing when there were four Men in Company, and therefore they beat me.

            , Constable. A Gentleman's Servant called me to go to a House in Hedge-Lane, in St. Martin's Parish; when I came into the Room, I found the Bed taken off the Bedstead, and laid on the Floor; the Prosecutor charged me with the Prisoner, and I carried her before the justice, who order'd her to be searched. I searched her Pocket, and found no more than 2 s. and she offer'd to go aside and let me search her as far as I would.
P. He might easily lose his Money, when his Breeches hung down to his Shoes, though I never touch'd it. But as soon as he miss'd it, he swore, Sir, as I do to you, 
               
                  Aye, G


             - d - the Bitch she has pick'd my Pocket. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10d.

John Underwood. The Prisoner was my Servant
, she came to me very well recommended, but had not staid above ten Weeks before several Things were missing. I examined her about them, and she confessed that she had taken a Silver Girdle Buckle, a Gold Ring, a Shirt, and two Ells of Holland, and had pawned them all at the Greyhound and Three Bowls in Hounsditch, for 18 s. The Goods were found there. She was carried before Alderman Brucas, who committed her to Newgate. I went thither next Day to see her, and then she confessed further, that she had taken from me a Portugal Piece of Gold that goes for 36 s. I was more surprised at this, than at all the rest, because I could not imagine which Way she could come at it.
Mrs. Underwood. Missing my Stockings and Aprons, I asked the Prisoner if she knew any thing of them? She denied that she did; and as I had received a good Character of her, I did not suspect her Honesty, but thought she might have put them among her own Things by Mistake, and therefore I desired to look in her Box. She readily opened it, and there I found my Aprons, one of my Holland Shifts, and my Prayer-Book. Upon this I began to mistrust her, for I thought she could not take all these Things by Mistake; and upon taxing her closely, she at last confessed that she had taken the Shift with a Design to carry it away, as she had done several other of my Things which she had pawned; but she said, the Aprons were put in her Box by Mistake.
Prisoner. My Box had no Lock nor Hinges, it always stood open; I had been Ironing late at Night, and put some of my Mistress's Things among my own, by Mistake: As for the Ring, I found it among some foul Things, and wanting Money, I carried it to pawn, but did not intend to keep it; for when my Master paid me my Wages, I fetched it out of pawn with my own Money.

            . The Prisoner was my Servant above eight Years, she all that Time bore a very good Character; and I had such an Opinion of her Honesty, that I was in the greatest Surprize when I heard of this Charge against her.
The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

            . I deal in Apparel, mercery Linnen and Lace
; my Shop is in High Holborn


, near Drury-Lane. It was broke open on the 10th of September in the Night I lost 31 Suits of lac'd Headcloths, they were taken out of the 31 small Boxes that stood by the Window, but the Boxes were left behind; 7 Ounces of narrow open silver Lace, 12 Yards of broad silver Lace, and 5 Yards of narrow silver Lace, 3 Yards of black Velvet cut out for a Scarfe, and a red silk Lining for it; 18 Pair of Manteel Tassels, a sattin Gown, a Shift, an Apron, a Point-lace Neckcloth and Ruffles; 17 back Heads with Lace, 14 Suits of Nightclothes, and other Things. On the 25th of April, this back Head - 'tis new Brussels Lace, and cost me 20 Guineas - was brought to my Shop to be sold by Eliz. Eager: I presently knew it to be one of those that I had lost, and therefore enquir'd how she came by it: She said she had it from Mrs. Broadhurst in Monmonth-street. Upon farther Enquiry, I found that Mrs. Broadhurst had it from Mrs. Slurrow in Westminster ; Mrs. Slurrow from Mrs. Sanders, and she from the Prisoner. I obtain'd a search Warrant from my Lord Mayor, and went with Mrs. Sanders and others to the Prisoner's House in Pye-Corner. In the Table Drawer below Stairs I found this Pair of minteel red Tassels with white Bugles; I can safely swear to 'em, for I know 'em from a thousand; I had 'em made on Purpose to suit the Fancy of a particular Lady. My Wife and Brother, and the Constable, went up Stairs with the Prisoner, and brought down with them these 12 pair of black manteel Tassels, which I verily believe are part of those I lost. Then the Prisoner himself put his Hand behind some Pewter on a Shelf, and took out these two Brussels Lace Suits, and gave them to my Brother. We ask'd the Prisoner how he came by these Goods; he said he bought a Handkercherful of these and other things of a Woman in Rag-Fair. - At first he said for 3 Guineas, but afterward for 3 l. 8 s. And he said he believ'd he cou'd find the Person out if he might have his Liberty to look for her. We did not care to trust him alone, but went with him; he carried us into a House where a large Company of Men were sitting round a Table: He call'd to one of them, and said, Hark ye, Are not you the Man I bought the Lace of? - I the Man! says the other, No; I know nothing of it. Why then I am mistaken, says the Prisoner. By his asking a Man this Question when he had told us but a little before that he had them from a Woman, we found he was only shuffling with us, and so we carried him before a Magistrate, and then he said he had all the Things from Mrs. Sanders.
Court. What Business did the Prisoner follow?
Lear. I suppose he dealt in old Cloaths
, for I saw some lying upon the Floor, but he kept no publick Shop.
Mrs. Lear. On the 10th of December, between 10 and 11 at Night, we left the Shop all fast and went to Bed, and between 5 and 6 in the morning we were call'd up, and round we had been robb'd; several Holes had been bored in the Pannel of the outer Window Shutter, and then the Pannel was slit down and so taken out: A Piece of Woollen of the Colour of the Shutters was nail'd over the Hole and daub'd with Clay. Thro' this Hole they had push'd back the inner Shutters, and so taken the Goods off of two Shelves next the Window. without getting quite into the House. Behind the Counter lay the 31 empty Boxes and a Parcel of Cloaths that had been push'd down. - This Head I took out of the Prisoner's Pocket. - I'll tell ye the whole Tale presently. - I can swear to all these Goods, and to this red and white Tasse particularly.
Juryman. I think you said it was in December that your Shop was broke open.
Mrs. Lear. December, did I say? - Then I mistook. - It was in September. - On the 25th of April, 
               
                  Betty 
                  Eager 
               



             came to our Shop with this Head to sell. - We ask'd her where she had it? Why, of Mrs. Broadhurst : We sent for Mrs. Broadhurst, she came, and told us she had it of Mrs. Slurrow. We went to Mrs. Slurrow, and she carried us to Mrs. Sanders, who keeps a Chandler's Shop and takes in Pawns. Pray, Mrs. Sanders, says I, How did you come by this lac'd Head ? Why, says she, 
               
                  Tom 
                  Adley 
               



             desir'd me to sell it for him. And where does he live? says I. Why says she, he has often told me that he liv'd in Peter's-Street; but I sent my Maid one Day to watch him, and so I found that he liv'd in Pye Corner. So we got a Warrant and went thither, and ask'd him if he had given that Head to Mrs. Sanders. He deny'd it at first, but afterwards own'd it. Have you got any more such in the House? says I; no, says He; I had indeed more of this old fashion'd Lace, but I have sold it all. And where did you get it? says I. Why, says he, I bought it of a Gentlewoman in Rag-fair, over against the dead Wall; I had a Handkercherful of it for three Guineas. Three Guineas? says I. No, says he, now I remember, it was 3 l. 8 s. We found this pair of red Tassels in a Drawer below, and then my Brother and I and the Constable went up and found 12 pair of bugle Tassels. There was a Coat hanging up; I ask'd the Prisoner if it was his, and he said, Yes. I search'd the Pockets and took out this lac'd Head. Now, says I, this is plain Proof against you, and therefore you may as well confess. Why then, says he, there's more below. So he went down with us, and took these two Heads from behind some Pewter, and gave them to my Brother. And now, says he, if you'll let me have my Liberty, I'll find the Woman I bought 'em of. And so you'll run away, says I. No, says he, I'll give my Bond that I won't. Your Bond? says I, that would be a fine Security indeed! No, we'll call a Coach and go together. And so away we went, and he carried us to a House where there was a Parcel of Thieves sitting round a Table, and he beckon'd to one of them, and said, 
               
                  Young 
                  Man 
               



            , did not you sell me a Parcel of Lace? No not I, says the Man. We found bu this, there was nothing in the Prisoner's Pretence, and thought that by leading us about, he only wanted an Opportunity to get away; and so we carried him before a Justice, and when he came there he offer'd to make himself an Evidence, and said that he had all the Things from Mrs. Sanders. Says the Justice's Clerk, This Man was try'd not long ago for stealing a Horse.

                  Sanders 
               



            . I keep a Chandler's Shop in Great St. Anne's-Lane, Westminster; my Husband is a House-Painter. The Prisoner has known me from a Child, for my Father was a Serjeant in the Guards, and the Prisoner was then a Soldier: And so he came to see me about 3 or 4 Weeks before last Christmas. He brought a blue Bag with him, but there was nothing in it then, and he only ask'd me how I did, and the like, and so went away again. But the next time he came, he brought 9 Ells of Linnen in the Bag to sell. He ask'd 13 d. a Yard; I bid him 11 d. and at last we agreed for 9 s. 6 d for the whole. He came again a Week after with the same blue Bag, and ask'd me if I knew any Body that would buy a Suit of lac'd Headclothes. I told him I did not want myself, but I would enquire among my Acquaintance He said the Price was 18 s. and so he left 'em with me, and I afterwards sold 'em to Eliz. Grindley, a very honest Woman. She was acquainted with Houses of Fashion, and knew where to dispose of such Things, and I had no Suspicion of the Prisoner, for I knew he dealt in old Clothes, and always took him for a very honest Man. On the Friday before the 25th of April he came and told me his two Daughters were going to be pass'd to another Parish, and then he shew'd me this lac'd Head, which he said he bought of the Duchess of Richmond's Gentlewoman, and he desir'd me to dispose of it for him. He bid me ask eight Guineas. I carry'd it to Mrs. Slurrow's (while he staid in my Shop) and she bid me six Guineas. I came back to tell him, and he bid me take the Money. I went again, but she had not the Money ready, and so I laid down four Guineas and a half, which my Maid paid him before two Witnesses, and he was to call next Day for the rest of the Money; he accordingly came, but she had not paid me; he came again next Tuesday, but the Money was not ready then neither; so that he never had it, for the Affair was discover'd presently after. Mrs. Slurrow brought Mrs. Lear to me, and said, she would have the Head if she could be sure that it was honestly come by. To satisfy them, I went with them to the Prisoner's House. He was not at home, but we staid till he came in. How do you do, Mr. Adley? says I. This Gentlewoman would buy the Head you left with me to dispose of, but she's scrupulous about its being honestly come by. Who are you ? says he, I don't know you, I never saw you in my Life before. I was surpris'd at this, but when they told him they had got a Search-warrant, he own'd that he gave me a Head, but he said he did not know it again. However, at last he confess'd, that that was the very Head he had left with me. This other lac'd Head I had got 
               
                  Betty 
                  Grindley 
               



             to felt. Mrs. Lear went with me to Grindley's to enquire after it, and she had sold it to Mrs. Dell, a Gentlewoman of the Town, in Westminster. Mrs. Dell had pawn'd it to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Ward 
               



            , and at his House we found it.
Mrs. Lear. Hear's another lac'd Head that was unwash'd when I lost it.

A. Sanders. This I had unwash'd from the Prisoner, and deliver'd it so to Mrs. Grindley. She sold it so to Mrs. Martin, who sold it again to a 'Squire, and the 'Squire made a Present of it to Mrs. Murray, another Woman of the Town in Bedford-Street, in Covent-Garden.
Mrs. Lear. And I found it upon Madam Murray, but neither she not the 'Squire are willing to appear here. - These lac'd Ends of a Neckcloth were my Lord London-derry's.
A. Sanders. And these I had from the Prisoner, I deliver'd them to Grindley, and she dispos'd of them to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Fowler 
               



            , at a Lace-shop in Duke-Street, but Mrs. Fowler is sick, and cannot come hither.
Mrs. Lear. This is my Velvet. There was three Yards of it. I found it at Mrs. Sander's House.
A. Sanders. I bought this Velvet of the Prisoner for 26 s. 6 d. I reckon there was but two Yards and three Quarters. I bought this Sattin Gown of him too, for I produc'd it to Mrs. Lear, tho' she knew nothing of my having it.
Prisoner. What did I allow you for selling these Things, as you say?
A. Sanders. Nothing.
Prisoner. That must be hard indeed.
A. Sanders. You spent your Money at my House for what you wanted. You did not say at first that you had them from a Man, but from a Gentlewoman, and that you gave 'em me to dispose of.
Mr. Lear. Mrs. Sanders told me at first, that she had 'em from Adley, who liv'd in Pye-Corner ; she said, he had told her he liv'd in Peter's-Street. She shew'd me the Sattin Gown and the Velvet freely, and I knew nothing of her having the Gown before she produc'd it; and she told me, that Grindley was gone over the Water with two Suits to sell.
Eliz. Grindley. I had this lac'd Suit from Mrs. Sanders, and I sold it to Mrs. Waters at the Golden-Ball in York-Buildings. Mrs. Sanders, indeed, told me at first, that this lac'd Suit came from a Woman of her Acquaintance, who was kept by a Gentleman. But about six Weeks ago the Prisoner being in Mrs. Sander's House, he told me, that she had the lac'd Heads from him.
Court. How came he to say that to you?
Grindley. Why, I being a Laundress, have sometimes an Opportunity of selling such kind of Things, and I had sold several for Mrs. Sanders. Now, you must know, that now and then I happen to get a little merry, as any other Body may do, and then I say any thing that comes uppermost; so coming into Mrs. Sanders's House in one of these merry Fits, there was she and the Prisoner, a sitting by the Fire; and says Mrs Sanders to me, This is the old Man that I have had all the lac'd Heads from. Ay, says I, and pray, old Gentleman, how do you come by such Things? Why, I'll tell you, says he, my Daughter lives with a Woman that is kept by a Jew in the Minories, and this Jew gives his Mistress these Things for Pocket Money, and she sends them to me by my Daughter to sell for her, and so I bring them to Mrs. Sanders. And so Mrs. Sanders gave 'em to me to dispose of 'em as well as I could; and this Head I sold to Madam Dell, a Town Lady, for three Guineas, and this to Mrs. Martin, who keeps Martin's Coffee-house at Charing-Cross. I was bid to ask six Guineas for it. Mrs. Clapham, at the Golden-Anchor, bid me two Guineas; I try'd at some other Shops, and at last I let Mrs. Martin have it for three Guineas and a half. I sold her another Head afterwards.
Mrs. Lear. And that, Mrs. Martin sold again to a Jew; but we cannot yet produce it.
Mrs. Martin. I bought two Heads of Mrs. Grindley, one of them I sold * to Mr. Bray, a young Gentleman, who said he bought it for a Present. - This is very like it.
* For Twelve Guineas.
Mrs. Lear. Like it? Why, is it not the very same? Did not he make a Present of it to Mrs. Murray ? and did not I find it upon Mrs. Murray ?
Prisoner to Grindley. Did you never say that you sold those two Heads at a Brandy Shop? now you swear you sold 'em at a Coffee-house.

Grindley. What if I did? Mrs. Martin keeps a Coffee-house over a Brandy-shop.
Mrs. Martin. I let the lower Floor of my House for 25 l. a Year, to Mr. Capstick, a Distiller. Mrs. Grindley, it seems, brought this Head to Mrs. Capstick, who shew'd it to me, and ask'd my Advice about it, whether it would make a Suit of Head-clothes for her. It was cut and mangled, and very dirty. I told her there would be many Joinings in it, and therefore I thought it was fitter for a Back-head than a Suit [for a Suit has four Lappets, and a Back-head but two.] Then she said she would not buy it, and ask'd me if I thought I could dispose of it for an Acquaintance of hers. What is she? says I. A very honest Woman, says Mrs. Capstick; I know her very well, her Husband runs Goods. This Woman (which was Mrs. Grindley ) came in, and I ask'd her whose Head it was? and she said it belong'd to a Cap woman who had it from her Cull. How came it to be cut so? says I. Why, says she again, she's a very maggotly Creature, and she cut it when she was drunk. I bid Money for it then, but she refus'd it and went away. She came three or four times afterwards, and at last I bought it, and some Time after, I bought another of her; she came at several other Times with other Heads, but I did not buy any more than those two.

            . I lodge in Mrs. Sanders's House. I was sitting in her Shop about Christmas last, when the Prisoner came in with a Bag under his Arm. He pull'd a Band-box out of his Bag and unty'd it, and shew'd Mrs. Sanders a Parcel of Tassels, and said to her, I have got these Tassels to sell, do you know any Body that will buy them? No, says she, except this young Woman, (meaning me) for she has liv'd with an Old-Clothes Woman, and may know how to dispose of them. Then he told me he'd give me 6 d. to sell 'em for him. I took them from him, and he bid me ask 2 s. a Pair for the large, and 18 d. for the small ones. These are the same, I can swear.
Mrs. Lear. And these mourning Tassels I found in the Prisoner's Drawer.
A Wilden. I went to the Gentlewoman's House, where I had been a Servant, and she said they were a perfect Drug, and that she would not give 2 s. for 'em all. I have seen the Prisoner several times at Mrs. Sander's House, and have seen her give him Money, both Gold and Silver. I have known her from a Child; she's as honest a Woman as ever liv'd, and her Husband bears a very good Character.
Prisoner. These were Sander's Tassels ; she took 'em in for a Pawn, and I had them originally from her; she desir'd me to sell them, and when I found I could not, I return'd them to her.

            , Sanders's Maid. The Prisoner came into my Mistress's Shop, and sat down in the great Chair and pull'd out some Head-clothes, and ask'd her if she could not be so good as to sell them for him. My Mistress would have had me to have gone, but he desir'd her to go herself; for he said it was a lac'd Suit that he had from the Duchess of Richmond's, and would have her ask eight Guineas for it. I have seen my Mistress pay him Money several times, and once she gave me in the Yard four Guineas and a half for him, and I carry'd it in and paid it to him.

One Day, when I was at my Daughter's, he came into the Entry, and deliver'd a Suit of lac'd Head-clothes to some Woman there, but I can't say who she was, for I did not take much Notice.

            . When the Prisoner was in Newgate he sent a Letter to me to come to him, and I went. - Says he, If Mrs. Sanders don't come down with the Crop, I'll make a blue Day of it, for I had all the Goods from her. Can you have the Face, says I, to say that you did not deliver them to her? Why not, says he, when she has us'd me so barbarously as to bring a Constable to search my House? But what would you have a poor Woman do, says I, when the Goods were brought to her, and found upon her? Do? says he, why, she might have sent for me, and I would have vouch'd that I saw her take 'em in Pawn, and that would have clear'd her and me too. From him I went to Mrs Sanders, and told her what he said. She answer'd, that she was innocent, and would not part with a Farthing. I acquainted him with her Answer, and he then sent me to her Husband to see if he would not lay down half the Crop. I went, but her Husband would not do any thing. I return'd to the Prisoner, and told him of it; And, says I, when she found that the Goods were stolen, she might think you might have them from some Thieves, and could have discover'd who they were. Ay, says he, and so I might have made a Noose for my own Neck. - Mrs. Sanders bears a good Character.

            . I took this Head in pawn from Mrs. Carman, who was Servant to Mrs. Dell, a Woman of the Town. - Mrs. Lear, could not swear to it when she found it at my House.
Prisoner. When the Search-warrant came to my House, Mrs. Sanders took me aside, and said, For God's sake don't say that you had the Things from me. But I told her, then I must tell a Lye to deny it, and my Conscience would not let me do that.
Mrs. Lear. He was at first so far from pretending that he had them from her, that he said he did not know her.
Prisoner. I had them all from her, and what I could not sell I always return'd, and the lac'd Heads were of so high a Price that I could never sell them.
Court. Prove what you say.
Prisoner. 'Tis in Hardship that I want Witnesses to prove it, and she took Care I should have none; for when she had any Thing to deliver to me, she us'd to send her Maid up Stairs to make the Beds; but I can prove that she ask'd the Gentlewoman what she should swear.

            . I went to see the Prisoner in Wood-street Compter, and as he was going before Justice Brocas, Mrs. Sanders came up to me in a very great Surprize and Flutter, and said, Lord, Sir, what shall I do? What Course shall I take? What can you advise me to? What shall I say? What shall I swear?
Court. Was you acquainted with her?
Mason. No, I never saw her in my Life before.
Court. 'Tis very odd that a Woman should express herself in such a manner, to a Man who was an intire Stranger to her. - What are you, Sir?
Mason. I keep a Chandler's Shop and a Brandy-shop in Aldersgate-street. - I have known the Prisoner a Year, and sometimes we have drank together, and I never saw but he behav'd himself well.

            . This Man was in the Compter with the Prisoner, and advis'd him to be an Evidence; and he, (as well as the Prisoner) said, If Sanders won't come down, by God, he was pleas'd to take God's Name in vain, we'll make a blue Day of it.

            . While Mr. Lear and his Wife and the Constable were searching my Father's House, Mrs. Sanders whisper'd to me, and said, For God's sake don't own that your Father had any thing to sell for me.
Court. Would you rather save Sanders than your Father?
A. A. No, to be sure, I would rather save my Father?
Court. Then, when your Father was in so much Danger, why did you, at the Request of Mrs. Sanders, conceal a Thing that might have done him Service?
A. A. I did speak of it.
Court. When?
A. A. Three Days after.
C. And why not sooner?
A. A. I was in a Fright, and did not know what to do. - I have seen my Father bring home lac'd Heads, and he told me that he had 'em from Mrs. Sanders to sell for her.
C. That won't do. Did you ever see her deliver any to him?
A. A. No.
C. Then what he told von signifies nothing.

            . On the 19th of April the Prisoner came to my Shop and cheapened a Pair of Buckles, but did not buy any, and when he was gone I miss'd a Pair. He came again next Day to cheapen more. He look'd over a large Parcel, and desired me to weigh several Pairs, which I did; but having a Suspicion of him, I watch'd him narrowly, and at last I saw him put one Pair in his Trowsers. I let him go to the Door, and then stopt him, and charg'd him with the Theft. He deny'd it stiffly, but upon my searching him, one Buckle fell from him to the Floor; upon which he took out the other and gave it me. This was corroborated by William-Charles Hitchen, who was in the Shop at the same Time; and the Jury found the Prisoner 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

, the Angel in Half Moon Court in Whitechappel


. Yesterday morning, before I and my Wife were up, there being only a Servant Girl below, I heard a Man come in and call for a Pint of Beer; it being a Stranger's Voice, I whipp'd up my Stockings and Breeches, and stepping to the Stairs-head, I look'd down and saw the Prisoner go to the Bar, take up a China Punch Bowl, and put it under his blue great Coat. My Girl came up with the Beer, and I presently went down. When he had drank his Pint he was going out very orderly; but I stopp'd him at the Door, and told him it was not kindly done of him to carry off my Punch Bowl. What do you mean? says he, I am the King's Officer, I have had an Information that you keep run China in your House; and I have Authority to search and take it where I find it. - Here's my Deputation. I ask'd him if he had a Deputation to go a Thieving, and not finding that he had, I carried him before a Justice, and the Justice committed him to Newgate.
Prisoner. I belong to the King, and to prove it, I have got my Deputation ready to produce. - Here it is. Then the Deputation was read. 'Tis dated Octo. 24, 1728. It impowers the Bearer, having a Constable and a Writ of Assistance, to enter Houses in the Day-time, and seize Goods prohibited, or for which the Custom has not been paid.
Prisoner. I have had several Informations of Tea and China being carry'd to the Prosecutor's House, and had no less than three when I went thither Yesterday to search.
Court. Had you any Constable or Writ of Assistance?
Prisoner. No, I can't say that I had.
Court. Who gave you the Informations?
Prisoner. I must beg your Pardon there, Sir, we that are the King's Officers must never discover Informe rs.

Court. Is it usual for you Officers to enter Houses and search 'em without a Constable or a Writ of Assistance, or without so much as telling the People your Business?
E. Walter. No.
The Jury found him 

               Guilty

Cornelins Herbert. The Prisoner came to my Shop on London-Bridge


, and desired to see some weighty Gold-Rings. I shew'd him two that were very heavy. He seem'd to be well pleas'd with them, and call'd for Pen and Ink to set down the Weight and Value. I began to suspect that he wanted to make off, and I happen'd to think right, for he took up the two Rings and ran out; I follow'd, as well as the Gout would let me, and cry'd, Stop Thief! He was soon seiz'd, and when I came up to him he had the two Rings in his Hand, and I took them out my self.
Prisoner. I had bought a Rings of the Prosecutor some time before, and I afterwards found that he had charged me 5 s. more than they were worth, and so because I would not be cheated again, I took these two Rings to shew to a Friend before I paid for them.
Mr. Herbert. I don't know that I ever saw him before.

             stole these Pipes and Cocks about 2 o'Clock on Whitsunday Morning. Fish put us upon it; for he said he had been out all Night, and could tell us of a rare Chance. We did one Parcel till 9 at Night, and then carried it to Will. Green, in Stanhope-Street, Clare-Market, and sold it him for 19 s. 6 d. He called us good Boys, and bid us take Care. Then we went about Eleven the same Night, and got as much more, and hid it in a Dunghill by the Ditch-side; but it was found by a Boy who went there to ease himself, and so the Prosecutor came to hear of it, and we were taken the next Friday Morning by a Watchman, as we came out of Brown-low-Street with some Lead we had stole; and so I was made an Evidence. Green is run away. He was tried here about 7 Months ago for receiving stolen Goods  *.

; May 13


Mr. Smith. On Sunday in the Afternoon, as I was walking in Grays-Inn-Walks


, there was an Outcry of several that had their Pockets pick'd, and going from thence to the Coffee-house, I there missed my Handkerchief. I presently step'd back, and bid the Door-keeper of the Walks let me know if he saw any suspicious Persons loitering about there: A Boy came and told me, that he saw two Men pick a Gentleman's Pocket in the dark Passage by the Bookseller's Shop. I went to the Passage, took hold of the Prisoner, and saw him throw down a silk Handkerchief. Sir, says I, you must go with me. Sir, says he, I am a Gentleman; what d'ye mean? I could find no Constable, and so I took him to my own House; he fell on his Knees, and made many Protestations of his Innocence, but upon searching him, I found my Handkerchief in his Bosom. Then he said, he was no Pick-pocket himself, but was only retain'd by them, and had 1 s. 6 d. a Day to attend on them, and take what they stole.
Rich. Smith. When my Father had brought the Prisoner home, the Prisoner kneel'd down and call'd Christ to witness that he never pick'd a Pocket in all his Life, tho' at the same time I saw him pull a Handkerchief out of his Pocket and put it into his Bosom; but when he found that my Father was resolved to search him thoroughly, he took it out of his Bosom again, and gave it to my Father, who own'd it; and then the Prisoner said, If it's your's, I can expect no Mercy.

* She and her Husband were convicted in October 1732, of paying counterfeit Money in Bartholomew Fair. He was fined two Marks, and both were to suffer three Months Imprisonment. See the Sessions Paper for that Year, Numb. VIII. page 246.
About six in the Morning the Prisoner came to the Prosecutor's Shop before it was open, to fetch a Shirt out of pawn; the Prosecutor's Servant went up for it; the Watch then lay on the Counter; when he came down she paid him and went out in a great Hurry. As soon as she was gone he miss'd the Watch, and upon Enquiry found it at another Pawnbroker's, where it was pledged by the Prisoner and her Husband.

Court. What do you know of the Prisoners?
Langford. I and the Prisoners went a Thieving together. Chriss Keightly lifted up the Shew-glass, and I took the gold Necklaces out, there was one large one and three little ones, we sold them all to 
               
                  John 
                  Marrian 
               



             in Mint-Street, for 34 s. 9 d. we divided 11 s. a piece, and spent the odd Money.
Court. What did Bigs do?
Langford. He stood still on t'other side the Shew-glass. He knew we were going at Thieving; but did not justly know that we were going to that very Shew-glass.


                  William 
                  Shaw 
               



            . On Langford's Information we took the Prisoners, and three other Boys a-Bed, at an Alehouse in St. Giles's, about twelve at Night; we found several silver Things upon them, and next Morning. we took Marrian.
Keightly. This Rogue, Langford, will swear any Body's Life away for a Farthing: Did you ever know me steal the value of a Pin, you Rogue?
Langford. Not before this Time.
Keightly. Did any Body see me in the Shop?
Lang. No; none of us were in the Shop.
Court. Where did the Shew-glass stand, was it within the Shop or without?
Prosecutor. Part without the Shop, but more within, and the Necklaces lay in the inner Part. The Lock was broke open - Marrian is in Surrey Goal. The Jury 

               acquitted
             Biggs, and found Keightly 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

Mr. Deveil.

Prisoner. I lay but two Nights at the Two-Brewers, and Langford and two more Boy

. By his Information we took the Prisoners out of their Beds, at one Evans's, who keeps the Two-Brewers, in Maynard-Street in St. Giles's.
Court. Langford, here are several Persons Lives at stake, you ought to be very cautious of what you swear. You were ask'd in a former Trial, but as you are now before another Jury, it may be proper to ask you again, if you know the Consequence of swearing falsely?
Langford. Nay, I don't know; but they say it's Damnation in t'other World. The Day after we robb'd Mr. Triquet, I and Jack the Hatter, and Mollying Jack, were going to Moorfields, and passing by this Gentleman's Shop, says Mollying Jack, I'll lay a Shilling, that Shew-glass will lift up. It won't, says Jack the Hatter. You lye but it will, says t'other Jack. Let's go back, and see then, says I; and so I went, and lifted it up, and took out these three pair of Stock-clasps and a half, and they both stood by to tell me if any Body was a coming. Then we went to

            's, and sold them all to him, for 6 s. 6 d. Then Jack the Hatter and I came back to the same Place, he lifted up the Glass, and I took out two pair of Tea-tongs, three Girdle-buckles, and the other half of the Stock-buckle. This was between 3 and 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and at the same time, the Gentlewoman was drinking Tea in a Room behind the Shop. We carry'd these Things to Marrian too, and sold them all for 10 s. And the same Afternoon I met Little Daniel. and he and I went to the same Shop; but a Woman looking out at a Draper's Shop over-against us, we waited for her going in; but a Dray stopping just before the Draper's Door, we took the Opportunity, and Daniel lifted up the Shew-glass, and took out these two Bunches of Spoons, fix in one Bunch, and five in the other, and we sold them to Marrian, for 17 s. The Jury 

               acquitted

W. Hartly. I had been at London, and returning homeward, I went to ease myself in a Ditch in White-Horse-Field, in Radcliff


, and afterwards, it being sultry hot, and my Shoes (which were new) drawing my Feet, I pull'd them off, and slapping my Hat over my Face, I laid down and fell asleep. I was waked by Somebody's twitching my Hat away, for I had put the Loop of it about my Finger. I started up upon my Breech, and, God! says I, where's my Shoes and Buckles? Says a Man, who was not far from me, There goes he that has got 'em, and pointed to the Prisoner, who was running off. I saw my Hat in his Hand, and followed him barefoot. He dropp'd my Hat, and jump'd over a Bank into a Garden, and I after, and took him. Now are not you a Rascal, says I, to rob a Man of his Clothes? You think to get the Devil and all of a Man, if he is but a little tight and clean. He called after the other Man, who followed at a Distance, and said, Jack! where' the Man's Shoes? but he sheer'd off. Then, says the Prisoner, if you'll go with me to Rag-Fair, plausible you may find him a selling them. So I collar'd him, and took him with me, and he went from one Place to another under that Pretence, but only wanted an Opportunity to get off; and so I got Help and secured him.

But they said, No; and so I carry'd a Silver Tankard to them in the Yard, and was going to fill a Pint for another Customer ; but was not got down more than three or four of the Cellar Stairs, when I heard a Noise in the Passage, upon which I step'd up again, and found the Prisoner Cave there; he was going out, but had stumbled in the Dark against some Tobacco-Boxes which were in the Passage. I stopp'd him for the Reckoning, as thinking he was going off without paying. He said , he had not paid, but his Friend was behind. My fellow Servant, 
               
                  Will 
                  Cleaver 
               



            , call'd to me, and said, May be he has got the Tankard ! Upon which, I ask'd Cave, What he had got under his Coat? He said, Nothing; but feeling about him, I found the Tankard, and call'd my Master to take care of him, while I went to secure the other Prisoner, Turner, who was endeavouring to get away backwards, for we have a back Door into Fetter-Lane, but it happen'd to be fast; and so I seiz'd him, and brought him to my Master, who ask'd him, why he went to run away? And he said, he was afraid of Trouble; but that he had no Acquaintance with Cave, any farther than that he had seen him once before, at Reading-Fair, and met him again accidentally, and so came to drink with him.
Cave. I went to the Cellar-Head , to deliver the Tankard safe to the Man that brought it to us ; and desir'd him to give me Change for the Reckoning.
J. Thomas. He was got two Yards beyond the Cellar-Head, and instead of offering to deliver the Tankard, he deny'd that he had it when I charged him with it.
Turner. I had seen Cave once at Reading-Fair, and meeting him again by Temple-Bar, we went to drink together, and the Tankard being empty, he said he'd take care and deliver it to the Man we had it from. I knew nothing but that he was an honest Man, and therefore thought he intended to do as he said. The Jury 

               acquitted
             Turner, and found Cave 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

Patrick Mac Voy. Going along Chancery-lane


 on Sunday Night with my Snuff-box in my Hand, this Creature begg'd a Pinch of Snuff; upon which I held out the Box to her carelesly, and she squeezed it out of my Hand; I catched hold of her Petticoats, and she took hold of me from the Collar, and in struggling, her Petticoats not being very strong, she got from me, and run round a Coach into the Hen-and-Chickens Entry, where she snugg'd down. I followed her close, and asked her for my Box; she said, if I'd let her tye up her Petticoats she'd give it me; but when she had done, she said she had not got it.

Prisoner. He met me in Holborn, and offered me a Shilling to go into a House of Office with him, but I refused. Then he asked me to drink a Dram, and took me into a dark Turning against the King's-Head in Chancery-lane, where he let down his Breeches, and bid me take up my Coats and fit in his Lap, and because I would not humour him, he charged me with the Robbery, and run after me and tore my Clothes to Pieces; but there was another Woman with us in the dark Alley.

                  , in his Warehouse
            , October 19.


Thomas Tomes. I have a Warehouse near Cavendish-Square


, in which I had several large Iron-bound Casks, new painted, for a Distiller. I went out of Town the 1st of October, and return'd the 28th, when I found my Casks stripp'd of most of the Hoops.


                  Thomas 
                  Smithers 
               



            . On Saturday Morning, Oct. 13. the Watchman knock'd my Mistress Tomes up, and told her the Warehouse was broke open; I went and found the Door broke, the Lock off, the Staple drawn, and the Casks lying at Rack and Manger, with the Hoops knock'd off. Three or four Days after I saw five or six of these Hoops at the Door of 
               
                  Benj 
                  Gilbert 
               



            , a Smith; I told my Mistress, got a Warrant from Justice Lamb, and upon Search found a Dozen at Gilbert's, and two more at 
               
                  John 
                  Harvey 
               



            's ; I know the Hoops to be the same we lost, because they are painted Green, have no Rivets, and when we try'd 'em they jump'd exactly into the Places they were taken from, and we could try them well enough, because some of the Casks had two or three Hoops left on them, which held them together.
Gilbert and Harvey depos'd that they bought the Hoops for a Penny a Pound of the Prisoner, who told them they were old Hoops that came off some Casks where he had been doing a Jobb, and were given him to sell.
The Prisoner pretended he had those Hoops of a Carpenter to sell for him, but said he did not know who the Carpenter was, where to find him.
The Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

            . I was looking after my Daughter Eleanor Griffin's Shop in Red-lion-square


, and the two Prisoners were standing at the Door; I had Occasion to go backwards, and returning presently, I saw Royley in the Shop with something under her Ridinghood. Good Woman, says I, you have got something there. No I han't, says she, and stepp'd out; I follow'd her, and call'd out to a Man who stopp'd her.


                  John 
                  Lowing 
               



            . As I went by the Prosecutor's Door I saw Judge on the Steps, and Royley in the Shop, by the Counter-side, and nobody else being in the Shop, I suspected them, and passing by the Door, stood to watch. Presently Royley came out, and Mrs. Atkinson follow'd, and cry'd, Spher ; which I did, and saw this Piece of Check under her Riding-hoop, but she dropp'd it in the Dirt before I could take it from her. Judge, by this Time, was got to Theobald's-Row, which is about 100 Yards from the Shop, but I ran after her, and brought her back.
The Jury found Royley 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.
             and 

               acquitted

. between the Hours of 1 and 2 in the Night
            .
Thomas Golden. I took a House, and put these Goods into it, and about 9 next Morning, a Porter came, and told me, the House was broke open, for I liv'd at Bromley, and had not then lain in this House that I was moving to, which was about a Mile off. The Grates, and Spits, and Jack, were lent me y my Aunt, 
               
                  Faith 
                  Burton 
               



            , but the Spade was my own. I went to see what Damage was dn, and found the Cellar-Door was cut, the upper Bolt thrust back, and the bottn Bolt wrenched off. Macdonald being taken for a Robbery impeach'd the Prisoners, and ay is Information I found some of my Goods in a Common-Sewer.


                  John 
                  Macdonald 
               



            . I and Baxter, and Sick Will, turn'd out together, and seeing this House uninhabited, we broke open the Cellar Door, with a Design to steal some Lead, but finding a pair of Grates, a Jack, a Couple of Spits, and a Spade, we contented ourselves with taking them; but being more than we could carry clear off at once, we planted some of them in a Ditch, and the rest we sold to a Woman in Old-Gravel-Lane.
Mr. Brown The High-Constable, Mr. Betty sent for me to assist him, in taking Sick Will. I was directed to a House in Church-Lane, whither I went, and enquir'd for him, ly Landlady wanted to know my Business, I told her, I came with a Message from his Father. She call'd to him, upon which, being satisfy'd I was right, I ran up Stairs and took him a Bed. I found in the Room, a Dark-Lanthorn, with three Candles in it, a Flint, Steel, and a pocket Tinder-box full of Tinder.
Mr. Betty. I carry'd Baxter and Macdonald before Justice Priestly for a Robbery. Macdonald inform'd against Sickwell, and directed us where to find him. I went with a Warrant, and took him a-Bed, and found in the Room, the Things mentioned by the last Witnesses. Sickwell then deny'd the Fact, but next Day being carry'd before the Justice, he made this Confession, which was taken in Writing, read to, and sign'd by him.
[Then Sickwell's Confession, taken before 
               
                  John 
                  Priestly 
               



            , Esq; Nov. 24. was read in Court.]
He therein confess'd, that about 4 Months ago, he and Nat. Sparks, and Will. Sanders, stole two Gowns in White-Chappel. That he, Baxter, Sanders, and another, stole some Fowls at Mile-End. That on Oct. 15. he and Baxter stole a Leg of Fork, and a Great-coat in a Butcher's Shop; and that on Nov. 19. about 1 in the Morning, he, Baxter, and Macdonald, broke into a House by Rogues-Well, near Stepney, and stole a pair of Grates, a Jack, 2 Spits, and a Spade.
Sick Will. As for the Dark Lanthorn, it was left in my Room by Macdonald, I was sick a-Bed when they took me, and Light-headed when I made that Confession - Here's one of the Jurymen knew me when I liv'd a Servant at Bethnall-Green.
Juryman. I know nothing of him.
Sick Will. I am sure I have carry'd many a Joint of Meat to his House.
Baxter. Macdonald is a vile Rogue, he came out of Prison but four Days before he was taken again.
Court. As there was no Body resident in the House, this cannot be a Burglary.
The Jury found them 


               Guilty of Felony
             only.

Christopher Stacey. I lost a Great-Coat and a Leg of Pork out of my Shop on the 15th of October, between 7 and 8 at Night. Justice Priestly sent for me, and there I found the Prisoner. Aldus confess'd the Fact.
Aldus. I was light-headed, and did not know what I said.
There being no Evidence against Baxter, the Jury 

               acquitted
             him, but found Aldus 

               guilty

John Hitchcock. The Prisoner came to my Shop between one and two, and desir'd to see some Cambrick; I shew'd her a Piece, for which I ask'd 3s. 6d. a Yard; she bid me 2 s. 4 d. I told her I had some of that Price, and put my Hand into the Counter to reach a Piece, and at the same Time I observ'd her take a Piece out of the Box that stood on the Counter, and put it into her Gown, which was tuck'd up round her; she did not like what I shew'd her, and made haste out of the Shop; I follow'd her, and said, Mistress, if you please you may leave that Piece of Cambrick,
Prisoner. Was I out of the Shop?
Prosecutor. Yes; she was off the Step in the Street, and I pull'd her in.
Prisoner. Did you see me put it in my Gown?
Prosecutor. Yes.
Prisoner. Did not I take two Pieces to the Door to compare them?
Prosecutor. No.

Prisoner. While he stoop'd in the Counter I took the Piece out of the Box to look at it at the Door, because the Shop was dark.
Prosecutor. 'Tis a light Shop.

John Chin. The Prisoner work'd with me in my Work-shop in the Garret ; I lost Wool several times d, and knew not who to suspect; at last one of my Men told me he had found the Thief, and that it was Old Will. I lock'd the Door, and waited his coming down from the Garret; I stopp'd him, and said, Will. this Man says he saw you put Niles in your Breeches ; (for such Wool we call Niles) and putting my Hand to his Breeches, I felt something soft, and bid him pull it out. He said he would not, for he had got nothing there; upon which I sent for the Beadle, who took down the Prisoner's Breeches, and took the Niles out. Next Morning we got a Search-warrant and went to his House; as soon as his Wife saw us, she said, I thought he was taken, because be did not come home at eight a-Clock last Night. In his Room we found about ninety Pounds of Wool, a Pot of Soap under his Bed (the Soap is a particular Sort that I use) and a Bottle of Oil, such as I likewise use in my Business.
Prisoner. I had no Design to steal the Wool, upon my Word, for I am old and cold, and put it into my Breeches only because it was warm and comfortable.

            . On Thursday Night the 25th of October, Will. Brown, Jo. Whitlock, Will. Blackwell, and I broke Colonel Romaine's House at Paddington, and stole a gold Watch, a large Parcel of Plate, and other Things, of which Brown and Whitlock were convicted here last Wednesday. On Friday October 26 (the Day after the Fact) Brown and Whitlock, and I went from Mr. White's in Grainge-road, near Newington-butts, with the gold Watch and the Plate, to the Cock in the Old-Baily, where we left Whitlock, and then Brown and I went with the Goods to the Prisoner's House, the ship in the Old-Baily. We left Whitlock, because I knew the Prisoner would be scrupulous of dealing with so many at a time.
Court. Then you were acquainted with the Prisoner?
Mitchell. Yes, I had dealt with him several times before, and especially in Watches that I had stole out of Ships in the River; and he used to say, those were the safest Goods to deal in, because the Owners were going to Sea, and could seldom stay long enough to prosecute; so that he was in no Danger on that Account; and he always desir'd me to be true to him, and not bring him into any Trouble - And so, as I was saying, Brown and I went to his House at the Ship, and turn'd into a little Box on the left Hand, where he presently came to us, and ask'd if we had got any Thing for him? Yes, says I, We have a gold Watch - shew it him, Brown. So the Watch was produc'd, and I told him the Price was 16 Guineas. 16 Guineas? says he, I can't afford near that Money; 'tis very old; the Gold is but thin, and the Watch is worth but little more than the Gold weights. We agreed to take eight Guineas. He ask'd me what else we had got? I told him some Plate; we shew'd it him; he took us into a little private Room, where he Doctors his Watches, and weigh'd it - There was 3 silver Salts - We stole 4, but we sold but 3 to him - 12 silver Forks, 6 Knives with silver Handles, and 1 little Knife with a silver Handle, 13 silver Spoons, 1 large silver soop Spoon, and a silver Hilt of a Sword. These are all I remember we carry'd at that Time; and as for the tea Spoons, the Women shar'd them among themselves. He weigh'd the Plate, and said there was 80 Ounces. We trusted to him for that, for we did not understand the Weights.
Then the Clerk of the Arraigns read the Record of the Conviction of Brown and Whitlock, by which it appear'd that all these Goods (among others) were stolen by them out of Colonel des Romaine's House.
Mitchell. The Prisoner was a little suspicious of Brown, because he was a new Face. I know, says he to me, I can trust you well enough, but I don't know whether I can trust that other Man. O ! says I, Brown is a very honest Fellow - he has been transported. Has he, Faith? says the Prisoner, nay then there's no Danger - we are all right! - well, what must I give you for this Plate? You know the Price, says I, what you always give - 4 s. 6 d. and Ounce. Then, says he, the Plate and the Watch together comes to just 24 l.
Court. Did you cast it up?
Mitchell. No, we trusted to his Reckoning, as well as to his Weights. He bid us go in and take a 3 s. Bowl of Punch, and he'd bring us the Money before it was out. He call'd a Coach, and took the Plate with him, and in about an Hour came back, drank Punch with us, and paid us 24 l. Now, says he, I hope you'll be true, and bring me into no Trouble - I have had a Bargain of this! - I question whether I shall make my Money on't again - You must use me better next time. He complain'd so much of hard Dealing, that I took out of my Pocket a silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones, and made him a Present of it.
Court. Look on that Buckle.
Mitchell. Aye, this is the same.
Court. Where did you get it?
Mitchell. We took it among the other Things we found in Col. Romaine's House - The Prisoner having paid us the Money, we call'd upon Whitlock at the Cock, and all three went back to Whtie's, where we shar'd the Money with Long Will. who was concern'd with us in the Fact. About a Fortnight after this, I and my Wife went to the Prisoner's, and sold him a gold Mourning-ring, it had the Name of Ann des Romaine engrav'd on the Out-side of it, he gave us a Crown for it; and this too we took from Colonel Romaine's - The Prisoner told me he had been try'd (or taken up) once or twice, but he knew how to get such things off.
Prisoner. Were all the Knives sold to me, on the Friday, with the rest of the Plate?
Mitchell. Yes.
Prisoner. Were the Knives out of the Handles ?
Mitchell. Yes.
Prisoner. Did I go into the little Place with you,
Mitchell. Yes.
Prisoner. Was 24 l. all the Money that was given?
Mitchell. Yes - I sold it for 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce, and you said it weigh'd 80 Ounces.
Court. Eighty Ounces at 4s. 6 d. and 8 l. for the Watch, comes to more than 24l.
Mitchell. I don't know as to that, but I am sure we had not a Farthing more of him.
Prisoner. Was not you at my House, from the time you sold the Plate, to the time you brought the Mourning-ring?
Mitchell. Yes, I was with Whitlock when he came to you to get his Watch mended.
Prisoner. But did not you come on the Saturday (the very Day after you sold me the Plate) and receive 3 l. more?
Mitchell. No, I receiv'd but 24 l. on Friday, and not a Farthing afterwards.
Prisoner. The Plate I bought on Friday, weigh'd but 75 Ounces, for the Knife-handles were not weigh'd then, because I had no Fire, and could not take the Knives out. The Watch was worth no more than the Gold weigh'd, and I allow'd but 7 l. for it, and so the Watch and Plate came to 24 l. 12 s. but they insisted upon 25 l. because it was even Money, and 25 l. I paid them that Day, and 3 l. the next Day for the Handles.
Court. But 24 l. 12 s. was more than the Watch and 75 Ounces of Plate, came to, at your Price.

                  Boice 
               



            . On the 21st of November, by my Lord Mayor's Order, I went with Justice Deveil, and Col. des Romaine, to search the Prisoner's House. The Justice read a Paper to the Prisoner, in which all the Goods the Colonel had lost, were distinctly mentioned, and the Prisoner positively deny'd that he had had any such Goods in his House - I found this Buckle in a Drawer, and took it out, and laid it upon a Table. Going back to my Lord Mayor's, I ask'd Mitchell, if he knew any thing of such a Buckle? he said, Yes. I return'd to the Prisoner's House, to fetch it, but it was remov'd, I ask'd his Wife where it was, she said, she believ'd we had taken it with us; but I pretending if she would help me to it, I could procure her Husband to be admitted to Bail, she took it out of a Drawer, and gave it me.


                  Lucy 
                  Montreasure 
               



            . This is my Buckle. It was lost from Col. des Romaine's.
Prisoner. By what particular Mark do you know it?
Mrs. Montreasure. The Hook had been broke in this Place, and was afterwards mended.


                  Phillis 
                  Mitchell 
               



            . I went with my Husband, when he sold this Mourning-ring to the Prisoner, I ask'd the Prisoner if he could help me to a Ring for my own wearing, he said he could have done it, if I had come but an Hoursooner, for he had just parted with a little Diamond-ring, that would have come cheap, and he would have sold it me for 3 or 4 Shillings profit, because he got by my Husband. I told him I did not care to wear that Mourning Ring, because I knew how it was come by.
Court. Was that in his hearing?
Phillis. Yes, and my Husband told him, it was got with the rest of the Things at Paddington; we drank 18 Penny worth of Punch, and had some roast Veal from the Cook's for dinner.
Mitchell. I might say so to the Prisoner, but I can't remember positively whether I did or no - I know they were talking about the Ring when I went to fetch the 6 Pennyworth of roast Veal.
Prisoner. Did not I ask if the Ring was stole?
Phillis. I don't remember such a Question.
Prisoner. Pray, my Lord, let her be examin'd a-part. [Then Ralph Mitchell withdrew.]
Prisoner. Where was the Ring weigh'd?
Phillis. It was not weigh'd at all that I saw; you gave 5 s. for it, and I gave you 2 Guineas worth of Silver for 2 Guineas.
Prisoner. Pray ask her how long she has been marry'd?
Court. I cannot ask her that. [Then her Husband was call'd in again.]
Prisoner. Did your Wife see the Ring weigh'd?
R. Mitchell. I don't know that it was weigh'd at all.
Court. He agrees with his Wife.
Mr. Boise again. When we ask'd the Prisoner for several Things in the Catalogue, he shuffled, and said, he was a Dealer, and might have bought such Things, but did not know that he had.
Prisoner to Mitchell. Did not Brown sell me some Buttons and a Watch that Day you were marry'd, which was 3 Days before you were taken?
Mitchell. I don't know; I was gone for the Veal.
Prisoner. I ask'd if the Watch was honestly come by, and if no House was broke open? for otherwise I would not buy it for the World; and you said that Brown brought the Watch from Dover.
Mitchell, I said the Watch came off the Water; and you said you was not afraid to buy such Watches, because there was seldom any Prosecutions on those Accounts - You and I have often had Dealings together.
Prisoner. And you frequently came to my House, did you?
Mitchell. Frequently! I came as ofton as I had Occasion - I sold you a silver Tankard not long ago, for 5l. - My first Acquaintance with you was by means of 
               
                  Ned 
                  Wilcox 
               



            , who then kept a Brandy-Shop in Nightingal-lane, and afterwards went to live in Charterhouse-lane, but I believe he is dead now, for I have not seen him this Twelvemonth.
Court. Colonel, when your House was broke open did you lose a gold Watch?
Colonel. Yes.
Court. And a mourning Ring?
Colonel. Yes.
Court. Was any Name engrav'd on it?
Colonel. Yes, Ann des Romaine.
Court. Any Plate?
Colonel. 13 silver Spoons, a silver soop Ladle, 12 silver Forks, 7 silver hasted Knives, 4 silver Salts, and 1 silver hilted Sword - These were my Goods.
Court. Any Buckles?
Colonel. A silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones.
Court. Whose Property was that?
Colonel. This Lady (Lucy Montreasure's) I bought it for her.
Prisoner. I have no private Room. The Place I carry'd them into was the Shop where I keep my Watches.
Mitchell. But there were Curtains to the Window, and he said, Draw the Curtains and then nobody can see us.
Prisoner. I weigh'd the Gold of the Watch, and told them it weigh'd but 7l. 10s. as for the Inside (as it was a large old Watch) it was not worth above 15 or 16 s. When they shew'd me the Box of Plate, I said, I hoped no House had been broke open, and if there had, I would not meddle with it for the World, for I had often been in Trouble. There was no Arms nor Cypher on the Plate. There was not above 1 third of it Sterling. It weigh'd 75 Ounces, and, with the Watch, came to 24 l. 12 s. They insisted on 25 l. which I paid them. When Mitchell went out, Brown told me he brought it from Dover, to sell for a Person there. Next Day in the Evening, they came to see the Handles weigh'd (for I could not take the Knives out of them before;) they weigh'd 13 Ounces, and I paid them 3l. 1s. 6d. 3 or 4 Days before they were apprehended Mitchell and his Wife brought me a mourning Ring - they were marry'd that Day - and Brown brought me some silver Buttons and a Watch.
Court. And could not you read the Name on the Ring?
Prisoner. Its possible I might read Ann des Romaine upon it, and yet might think nothing of the Robbery.
Court. But was not the Story of Col. Romaine's Loss very strong then?
Prisoner. Yes, it was so; and I had heard much Talk about it, but really I did not think of it when I bought the Goods.
Juryman. Had not you one of the Warnings that were given out on this Occasion? - for its common to send them to Watchmakers, as well as to Goldsmiths.
Prisoner. I can't tell but I might have had seen an Advertisement in the House, but I can't remember that I had seen it, or if I had seen it I had forgot the Particulars - O here is my Girl! she has brought the Book I sent for - This is the Book where I set down what I buy -
Court. This Book is no Evidence, but you may refresh your Memory with it.
Prisoner. Here is - 'Oct. 26. Bought 75 ' Ounces of old Silver, and an old gold ' Watch, large Size; the Watch for 7l. ' and the Silver for 18l. 12s.'
Court. Of whom.
Prisoner. 'Of Mr. Mitchell - the 27th ' Bought 13 Ounces of old Silver, of Mr. ' Mitchell for 3l. 1s. 6d. Then here's the ' Day they were marry'd, bought an old ' silver Watch of Mr. Brown, Mr. Mitchell's ' Friend, for 2l. 2s. and some old silver ' Buttons.'

            . I have known the Prisoner ever since he was Apprentice to Mr. Watts, in Fleetstreet, which is 14 or 15 Years ago; I liv'd over-against him, he had the Character of an honest fair dealing Man, 'till two Years ago; but since - I have heard he has been taken up for receiving stolen Goods.

Court. Did you never hear of his receiving stolen Goods?
Thorn. I have indeed heard some such thing, but do not know it.


                  William 
                  Edlin 
               



            . I have done Business for him, and found him a fair Dealer. Tho' I can't I say but things have been whisper'd about - and so forth - of his buying Goods of ill People.
- Grace. I have known him 25 Years, his Character was good - when I first knew him - I have dealt with him at a Market Price. And have trusted him with Rings, and once with a gold Watch - I never heard any ill of him, more than from his own Mouth; he told me himself he had been taken up upon an Affair.
Prisoner. Yes, I was taken up twice this Summer, but acquitted - I was put in an Information about a gold Watch, but I gave 400 l. Bail, and nobody appear'd against me - and when any of these Rogues are apprehended, they make a common Practice of informing against me - I hope the Court will observe the Price I gave - Mitchell has been burnt in the Hand here, and his Wife has had 2 Husbands hang'd.
The Jury found him 

               guilty
            .

                  Gallimore 
               



            . Coming from beyond Temple-Bar, at Night, I enquir'd my Way to White-Friars-Stairs, a Man who had two Women with him, told me, I was past the Stairs, and must turn down such an Alley. I went as he directed, and he and the Women follow'd, and ask'd me to drink a Dram. I told them, I had no dram Money. He said I was welcome whether I had or no, for it should cost me nothing. He went into a House, he call'd for two Quaterns, paid a Shilling, and left us. The Prisoner then came up to me, and said, What do you call for? I told her I had no Money to spend. Sure, says she, you won't trouble the House for nothing? With much Importunity I gave her 6 d. she laid her Hand on my Thigh, and pull'd my Watch out.
Prisoner. Did not you charge the other Woman for this?
Gallimore. The other Woman held me while the Prisoner got off, and therefore I charged the other Woman. I was beat and abus'd there, 'till my Face run down with Blood, and at the same time I lost my other Goods, which were in a Bundle. The Constable came, and I and the other Woman (Ann Castle) were sent to Woodstreet-Compter. The Prisoner came to me there in another Dress, and desir'd me to be easy ; I told her, perhaps I might, if I had my Goods again ; and in a little time they were all sent to me.
Prisoner. He told me, in Woodstreet-Compter, he did not know the Woman that robb'd him.
Gallimore. Here's the Porter that brought me my Goods again.


                  Robert 
                  Murry 
               



            , Porter. A Man call'd to me, as I came out of my Master's House, in Milk Street, and, says he, Go over to Mr. Gallimore, at the Bull-Head, and give him this Parcel. And who must pay me? says I. Why, says he, the Gentleman will. I found Mr. Gallimore and the Constable there, and the Constable said, I'll be hang'd if here are not the Things; they open'd the Bundle, and there was a Watch and some Linen in it. I went from thence and saw the Man who sent me, going into the Compter - It seems, he's one of the Runners there - I ask'd him for my Money, but he deny'd that he sent me, and he is run away since.


                  Mr. 
                  Cathery 
               



            , Constable. The Prisoner came to me next Morning (after the Prosecutor lost his Goods) and ask'd me, what she had best to do? I told her, the best way would be to send the Man his Goods again; and in half an Hour they were sent accordingly.
Prisoner. I never saw the Prosecutor, till I saw him pulling the other Woman about in Hanging-Sword-Alley.



                  Thomas 
                  Smith

                  Gallimore 
               



            , were brought Prisoners to me in Wood-Street-Compter, and next Morning I saw the Prisoner in a green Gown and flower'd Robings, talking with Gallimore, and he did not charge her.


                  Richard 
                  Bromhall 
               



            . I receiv'd Castle and Gallimore into the Compter. The Prisoner's Husband is confin'd in our House, and the Prisoner coming to see him, ell into Company with Gallimore, and tho' she talk'd with he did not know her, but said, he was certain Castle was the Woman that robb'd him.


                  William 
                  Welch 
               



            . I was in the Compter-lodge that Night, and some Body said to the Prosecutor, Do you know the Woman that robb'd you ? I charge no Body here, says he, and I would not see the Woman that robb'd me, for never so much ; tho', at the same time, she was in his Company, and drinking with him - He afterwards went into her Husband's Room; her Husband ask'd him, if he knew the Woman? and he answer'd, Yes, I am sure I know her; and then she stood with him while he spoke, and she was in the common Dress that she comes in every Day to the Compter to see her Husband - He and she were together all the Morning; he said, he had met a naughty Woman that carry'd him to a Brandy-house, where one held him, while another Woman pick'd his Pocket, and that he should know her from a hundred. What sort of a Woman was she? says the Prisoner. Why, says he, she was lustier than you, and pitted with the Small-pox, and was in a black Gown.


                  Sarah 
                  Davis 
               



            . The Prosecutor met me, and said, How do you do, 
               
                  Kate 
                  Buck 
               



            ? I told him, I was not Kate Buck. If you are not, says he, I wish you would show me where she is, and I'll give you half a Crown; and so Kate Buck came out and I shew'd her to him - This was the Night before the Prince came - and a Fortnight after the Robbery.
Court. Is her Name Buck?
Prisoner. That was my Maiden-Name.
Another. The Prisoner and Prosecutor were drinking together in the Compter, and he said to her, I wish I could see Kate Buck, but I would not have her to see me. It's my Belief, says she, you don't know her. Not know her? says he. Yes, I know her from five hundred.
Court. He might be afraid to own he knew her when he was in the Compter among so many of her Acquaintance.
Prisoner. He did not challenge me 'till a Fortnight after the other Woman was committed upon his Charge, as she can prove.
Court. Shall that Woman be call'd ? She must answer your Questions if you desire it - But then she must answer mine too.
Prisoner. I don't want to call her.
The Jury found the Prisoner 

               Guilty
            .

, Nov. 26
.
Ben. Johnson. About 7 at Night, I met this Gentlewoman, in Broad St. Giles's, she ask'd me, to give her a Dram I refus'd, but she follow'd me, and begg'd for a Pint of Beer. At last I went with her to the Three Compasses against St. Giles's Church


, where we had three Pints. We went into a private Room by ourselves, and I hid my Watch then; but before we had empty'd the last Pint, I miss'd it. Upon which I call'd the Landlord, and sent for the Constable, who carry'd her to the W house, and from thence to the Round-House, where my Watch was found upon her.



                  Jonathan 
                  Hazledine 
               



            . I keep the Round-house. The Prisoner was brought thither to be searched for the Watch, but as we could find nothing of it in any Part of her Clothes, we concluded she had put it in a certain private Place; I found it there, and pull'd it out by the String.


                  John 
                  King 
               



            , Watchman. When we could not find the Watch in her Cloaths, I said, I believed she had hid it in a particular Place, which is easy to guess at without naming, for I knew such things had been done by other Gentlewomen on the like Occasion. So we propos'd to search her, but she refusing to let us, Mr. Hazledine, the Governor of the Round house, desir'd his Wife to do it ; but she bid him do it himself and he would, for she would not be concern'd in any such sobb. Whereupon he undertook it, and I and the Constable of the Night, assisted in holding the Prisoner, while he examin'd her, and in a little time he took the Watch out of the Close-Clipboard.


                  Joseph 
                  Anderson 
               



            . When we had search'd her in the common Way, and could not find it, King told us, he believ'd he knew where it was, and that a superficial Examination would signify nothing, for if we expected to get it, we must search to the Bottom. So I held her Hands, and turn'd my Backside to her Feet while they made the Search, for I did not much care to see how they proceeded. I heard one of them say, that he felt it, and soon after, that he had got it out, and then I venture to look back, and saw the Watch in his hand. He wip'd it, and gave it to me, and it is.
Prisoner. I and my Husband had quarrel'd, and I was crying as I went along the Street, when the Prosecutor met me, and ask'd me, what I cry'd ? I told him, I had got a wicked Husband that had abused me, My Dear, says he, will you leave him, and go along with me? o, says I, tho' he has been a barbarous Man te, I'll never do that, for I bare two Children by him, and am now big with another. Will., says he, you may go and drink with me, Forever. And so at last, he overpersuaded me and when we came to the Alehouse, he wanted to have to do with me, but having no Money he gave me the Watch to pawn for a Guinea, and then, because I refus'd to let him have his Will, he charged me with picking his Pocket, and sent for a Constable, who carried me to the Round-house, where they stumbled and strumbled, and trowd me about till the Watch was found.
Constable. She told me she knew nothing of the Watch, and never so much as saw it, but when we had found it upon her, she desired me to make the Matter as early as I could.
The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

, October 26.


Mr. Robotham. On Friday the 26th of October, between 12 and 1 at Noon, I lost my Watch in a Crowd at the Corner of Exchange Alley


, where I stood to see a Man in the Pi lory, but I can't say who took it.


                  William 
                  Irish 
               



             As I stood to see the Man in the Pillory, I heard a Noise of a Pick-pocket, and somebody said the Prisoner had put a Water into his Pocket ; I observed him, and saw him take a Watch out of his Pocket and drop it. The Prosecutor came and owned it to be his. It had a black leather String.


                  William 
                  Gardner 
               



            . Somebody said the Prisoner had pick'd a Watch out of a Man's Pocket. I pick a Pocket! says the Prisoner, what do you mean by that? and presently he pull'd out a Watch stily and bove it down, and I took it up. It was a silver Watch with a black String. I held it up, and 
               
                  Jack 
                  Catch 
               



             came and said, Let's see hold of the Watch; and so he took it out of my Hand, and the Prosecutor came and own'd it.


                  John 
                  Hooper 
               



            , Executioner. Faulkner was standing in the Pillory for uttering bad Money; and while I attended there, the Prisoner came by me, and some followed him and said he had pick'd a Man's Pocket of a Watch; I look'd and saw the Watch upon the Ground; Gardner and I stoop'd for it at the same Time, but I took it up.

Gardner. No, I, and he took it out of my Hand.
Harper. I believe his Hand might be upon it, and I said, what do you do with it? But he never held it up in any manner whatsomever. I deliver'd it to Mr. Makepeace the Constable, at the Cross-Keys Tavern, and the Prosecutor own'd it there.
Prosecutor. Gardner took the Watch from the Ground, but did not hold it up, for 
               
                  Jack 
                  Catch 
               



             presently snatch'd it out of his Hand.


                  John 
                  Jones 
               



            . I saw the Prisoner have a Watch with a black String in his Hand at the Corner of 'Change-Alley, and he went into a Haberdasher's Shop (behind a carv'd blue coat Boy that stands at the Door) and put it into his Pocket.
Makepeace There was an Outcry of a Pick-pocket; Harper follow'd him, and presently held up a Watch in his Hand, and said, Who has lost a Watch? And as soon as he saw me, he said, Here's a Constable! So we went to the Cross-Keys, and there the Prosecutor saw it.
Prosecutor. This is my Watch, the same that Hooper had in his Hand.
The Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

Elizabeth Bromfield. I keep a House in Bell-Yard in King's-street, Westminster


, where I sell Greens and Fruit
. I keep the Lower-part for my own Use, and lett all the Rest. This Woman robb'd me of all that I had in the World, and did not leave me so much as an Apron or a Cap to put on. About 6 in the Morning, I lock'd my Door, and took the Key in my Pocket, and went out to Covent-Garden-Market to buy some Apples, and returning, between 7 and 8, my Door was broke open, and my Silk-gown, and Quilted-petticoat, and two Gold-rings, and 9 s. were gone, I expected (suspected) the Prisoner had done it, because about two Months before this, she had robb'd me of a Flannel-petticoat, and 15 s. for which I had her sent to Bridewell for six Weeks. I could not find her again 'till about a Month ago, when she came to see

            . The Prisoner lay three Nights at my House, about four Months ago; she had nothing to eat nor drink, and so she left a Serge-coat with me for Lodging, and Bread, and Small-beer; and afterwards she told, she had left her Mother's Wedding-ring in pawn for Half a Guinea, and Six-pence Use, and ask'd me to buy it, and said I should have it as cheap as any Body. I told her, I would give as another, and so I carry'd it to a Goldsmith, who weigh'd it, and said it came to 16 s. and he would give no more; whereof I gave her 16 s. 10 d. for it, and here it is.
Prosecutrix. This is the Ring I lost.
Prisoner. Did I pawn the Ring?
Bennet. You said your Husband pawn'd it.
Prisoner. Did I ever wrong you?
Bennet. No.

            . I lodge at the White-Bear at Hadley, near Barnet; the Prisoner came thither on Sunday, the 9th of December, about 9 in the Morning, he call'd for a Pen and Ink, and went into a Room to tell some Money. He came out again, in a little Time, and told me and another, he could shew me such a Sight, as I never saw with my Eyes. He pull'd out a Bag, and put twelve 3 l. 12 s. Pieces, and one Guinea into my Hand; from another Bag he took out several other Outlandish Pieces of Gold, but did not tell the Number of them; putting his Hand in his Pocket, he shew'd me Parcel a of Guineas, I can't say how many there might be; and then, opening a Paper, he produc'd a Diamond-ring, and said, he believ'd that was of more Value than all the rest; he likewise pull'd out a Purse of Gold, as he said it was, but he did not open it - and as for Silver I did not see any. He told me that his Master, who (he said) liv'd at Nottingham, had sent him about the Country with Orders to receive this Money for Goods, but I thought it more likely that he had committed some Robbery, or Murder, and so I fetch'd Assistance and apprehended him on suspicion, upon which he at first said he'd make me pay for stopping him on his Journey - But afterwards he own'd that he had robb'd his Master East.

Court. Was his Examination taken in Writing ?
Dean. I can't say as to that, but he made no Confession to me.

             told my Father, and me, that he suspected the Prisoner, and wanted a Constable. I said any Man might take a Thief. My Father, Humphry Buckle, seiz'd the Prisoner, and said he should go with us before the Justice. The Prisoner refused, and pulling out a Pocket-Book, said, Here's my Orders from my Master in the Country. I did not see the Writing, for he made a Hand of it; but I saw 48 Guineas, 12 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each, and some Doubloons, and double Doubloons, I think they call 'em. The Morning ( after he had been before the Justice ) as I lay by him on the Bed at the White-Bear, he confess'd to me, that he had robb'd his Master East of that Gold, and that he took it out of the Scratoir.
Court. Did he say he had taken any thing else?
Buckle. Yes, I remember a Piece of White Dimity and some other Things.
Court. Did he tell you where Mr. East lived?
Buckle. Yes, it was somewhere in London near the Monument; but I forgot the Name of the Street. And he wrote this Letter to his Master, who thereupon came down that Monday Night.
Court. Did you see him write the Letter?
Buckle. Yes, I sat close by him when he writ it.
Court. Then it may be read in Evidence.

            , the Younger (aged 12) My Father sent me with a Bottle of Rum in a Basket, to carry to Black's- Fields. The Prisoner follow'd me from Layton's-Yard (where they build Ships) to a bye Alley, close by a Pond, and there he said he belong'd to the King, and must have my Rum, and so he laid hold of it, and made me set it down, and then he took it up, and walk'd a little with it; I cry'd for my Basket, and a Gentleman coming along, the Prisoner took to his Heels and run off - This is the Basket, there was a Handkerchief in it, and he took that too.

Prisoner. In what County was this?
Boy. In Farthing-Alley, in Jacob-street,on t'other side of the Water.
Prisoner.Then it was in Surry.
Court. Where was the Basket found?

He ask'd us to go with him to a House in White-Chapel, we went, he own'd he had sold the Rum there, and the Woman of the House deliver'd the Basket to the Prosecutor.

                  Allen

Prisoner. I never sold a Drop of Rum there in my Life; but I and another got drunk aboard a Ship, and coming along where the Boy had set down the Bottle to rest himself. and both of us being a little Maggoty, we gave the Bottle a push for fun, and down it fell and broke, and I having three Pounds of Tea, I put it into the Basket and carry'd it away and sold it, and then left the Basket at the House where it was found.

            . On Friday the 4th of Jan. I had been in the City to receive some Money for my Master's Brother 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Hales 
               



             Esq; and as I was going home to Suffolk-Street, I met the Prisoner by Temple-Bar, and she took me to her Lodgings by St. Giles's Pound


, and there she robb'd me of 8 Guineas, and a 
               
                  Crystal 
                  Seal 
               



            , set in Gold, that belong'd to my Master's Brother; and a Silver Watch; a Mother of 
               
                  Pearl
                   Snuff-Box
               



            , and a pair of Silver Knee-buckles of my own, and these were all in my Breeches.
Court. And do ye know how they were taken out?
Edwards. She took them when I was asleep, for I pull'd off my Breeches, and the rest of my Things and went to Bed with her, and she took the Buckles out of my Shoes and another out of my Stock. But the Buttons were in my Shirt-sleeves and the Ring upon my Finger.
Court. Then there was nothing taken from your Person but the Ring and the Buckles?
Edwards. No, and when I waked in the Morning I mist my Things, and she was gone too. I enquired for her of the People of the House, and left Directions with them where I lived. And soon after, I heard she was in the Round-house. I went to her there, and she Confest she took the Things from me, and fell on her Knees before the Constable and asked pardon.
Prisoner. He has kept Company with me above a twelve-Month, and he knows very well that I am with Child by him.

Edwards. I never saw her, to my Knowledge, before that time.


                  William 
                  Davis 
               



            . On Saturday, the 5th of January, between 6 and 7 in the Morning, the Prisoner came to a Shop where I live, call'd for a Dram, and ask'd me to change her a Guinea. I said I could not, and then she gave me a Shilling to change. She shew'd me a Gold-seal, a Snuff-box, a Silver-watch, two Knee-buckles, two Shoe Buckles, and a pair of Stone-buttons.


                  John 
                  Smith 
               



            . The Prisoner took a Cellar next the Street, of my Father.
Court. Did she live in a Cellar then?
Edwards. Yes, her Lodgings were below Stairs.


                  Josiah 
                  Allen 
               



            . I was sent for by Mr. Hadly at Mr. Nevil's the Red-Lion, in St. Giles's to take the Prisoner. I found upon her 8 Guineas, 3s. 6d. a Mother of 
               
                  Pearl 
                  Snuff 
               



            -box, and 1 Shoe-buckle.
Edwards. I was told she gave the Seal to the Man at the Brandy-shop.
Davis. Yes, she gave it to me, and I deliver'd it to the Owner.
Allen. She told me she had the Money and Goods from a Man for lying with him 3 or 4 Nights at the Bell in Smithfield. I enquir'd there, but could hear nothing of her.
Court. Did she say, he gave them her, or that she took them?
Allen. He charged her with other things, and she said there was all she had; but did not say that he gave it her. Court. Did she kneel to you and ask pardon? Allen. No; but I saw her offer the Man who charg'd me with her, two Guineas to let her go.


                  Francis 
                  Waker 
               



            . About one a Clock a Saturday Morning, the Prisoner came into a Publick-house where I was, for a Pint of Beer, and ask'd if they could change a Guinea; she was answer'd, No. She lighted a Candle, and went out, some Body there said, she had a Watch, and a Snuff-box; upon which I follow'd her 4 or 5 Doors, and she went into another. I stood at the Door to listen, and heard a Woman's Voice, saying, Well, Grace, What have you got to Night? She answer'd, That as will fetch my Clothes out of pawn, and now I'll follow this Trade no more, but get into a Place and live honest. I suppose some Body there had got a Buckle from her, for I heard her say, Now I can bang you for taking that Buckle. She was ask'd how she could be so barbarous to serve the Man so? And she reply'd, I did it out of Spight, for when I had pick'd him up, and carry'd him to my Lodging, he could do nothing.
Prisoner. The first House where the Prosecutor lay with me, was the Coach and Horses in Bond-street. I am an Oyster-woman by Trade, and that Night as he lost his Things, I was sitting by Temple-Bar with my Goods, and he came out of the Devil-Tavern, and call'd, Here, you Oyster-woman! and I turning about, O, says he, is it you my Dear? How do you do ? Will you go and take a Night's Lodging with me? I said, No, and with that he threw my Oysters about the Street. You Villain you, says I, han't you done enough in getting me with Child, but you must throw my Goods away? Then he said, truly, that he'd make me any Satisfaction, and so he gave me a Crown for my Oysters, and follow'd me to my Cellar, where he would go to Bed, and there was another Woman with me, and I went out and left them together - When I was at the Red-Lion against Drury-Lane, Will. Adams, the Thief -catcher, told me, if I'd give him two Guineas he discharge me, and because I would not, he sent for Allen the Constable - When the last Witness follow'd me from the Coach and Horses Alehouse, where I went to change a Guinea, he went to put his Hands up my Coats, and ask'd me to go along with him; and when I was at the Brandy-shop, Davis bid me go backwards and warm myself, and he brought me half a Pint of Liquor, and begg'd the Seal of me, and said it was Brass; but when he found I would not part with it for nothing, he gave me a Shilling for it - If I would have spent the Money among these People, I should soon have been let loose again.
The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10d.

*Whitesides was in April, 1732, convicted of stealing a Hat. Sessions-Paper, Numb, IV. pag. 114. And last Sessions he was try'd with 
               
                  James 
                  Ford 
               



             for a Burglary, but they were both acquitted.


                  Robert 
                  Alcock 
               



            . I live with Mrs. Wall, who keeps a Shop
 the Corner of Mark-lane in Tower-street


. In the Evening I shut the Sash-door next the Street, but did not bolt it, and went backward to light Candles. In about 5 Minutes I return'd with the Candles, and found the Door open. I look'd in the Pigeon-holes behind the Counter, and miss'd a Parcel of Men's Gloves, upon which I enquir'd in the Neighbourhood, if any suspicious Persons had been about the Door; and 
               
                  Richard 
                  Pitt 
               



             inform'd me, that he had seen such a one as Whitesides loitering up and down, and sometimes standing by a Ballad-singer; and he said, if we went directly to Rag-Fair, we might chance to find him with the Goods in some Gin-shop. So Pitt, and 
               
                  John 
                  Hawkins 
               



            , and 
               
                  Edward 
                  Ford 
               



            , and I went all together. And as we were passing by the backside of the first House, from Tower-hill, going into Rag-fair, we look'd in at a Window, where there was a Candle, and saw Whitesides trying on a pair of the Gloves; upon which we went to the Fore-door, and found Marshall shutting up the Stall (it was an Apple-stall;) we search'd him, and took one pair of Gloves out of his Pocket, and then we went in; but having made some Disturbance in seizing Marshall, I suppose Whitesides took the Alarm and hid the Gloves; for at our first going into the Back-room we could find nothing but the Paper they had been wrapp'd in, and one pair lying loose on the Dresser: However, upon farther search we found the rest under a Cherry-Sieve. Whitesides ran up Stairs, and Marshall got into the Cellar; but we got a Constable and secur'd them both.


                  Richard 
                  Pitts 
               



            . As I stood at my Door, a Girl was singing Ballads, and Whitesides came and saunter'd about her for some time, and all on a sudden he was gone. I was hardly three Minutes after, when Robert Alcock came out, and said, he had lost a Parcel of Gloves. I told him what a loose Chap I had seen, and that if we went immediately to Rag-fair, it was a Chance if we did not find him a selling the Gloves in some of the Gin-ships. So we and 2 more went, and at a Back-window, I saw Whitesides standing by a Candle, and trying a Pair on. We took Marshall at the Door, and found a pair of Gloves in his Pocket, and going backwards, Whitesides ran up, and Marshall down Stairs. One pair of Gloves lay on the Dresser, and the rest we found under a Cherry-sieve, which a Girl was sitting on. Marshall bid Whitesides go and fetch the Man they bought the Gloves of, and Whitesides would fain have gone, but we would not trust him.
Whitesides. I was try'd here last Sessions, and resolving to get clear of ill Company I enter'd my self on board a Ship; but going to take Leave of my Brother, I met Marshall, who ask'd me to buy a pair of Gloves, and so I stepp'd into the House to try them on.
Marshall. That's very true, for Whitesides is an innocent Man. I found the Gloves in a Dust-hole by the Postern on Tower-hill, and meeting one Mrs Pattison, she desir'd me to call at the Corner-house going to Rag-fair, and help the Girl ( 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Gibbs 
               



             ) to shut up Shop, which I did, and Whitesides coming by, I said to him, See here, what I have found! and, says he, What will you have for a Pair? I told him, a Groat. So he went backwards to try them on, and in the mean time these People came and broke in upon us.

            . On Saturday Morning, my Wife told me, as she came by Mr. Hackshaw's empty House, which is but 3 Doors from mine, she saw the Bar of the Cellar-door loose. Then, says I, some Rogues have been stealing the Leaden-sink in the Kitchen. That would be worse, says she, than when they stole the Pipes a Year ago. As I had the Key of the House, I went to examine how it was; I found the Lead of the Sink was taken out, and laid upon the Floor ready to be carried away. O, thinks I, the Gentlemen will come to fetch it at Night, and I can't do less than to give them a Welcome. So I spoke to 
               
                  Robin 
                  Ballance 
               



             to bring his Gun and to sit up with me that Night, which he did. I went out about 12 but found nothing stirring. I went again in less than an Hour and heard a ticking in the Cellar, and by and by a light was struck. I goes home to my Wife - Her Name is Nanny, says I, now my Chaps are in the House, but call the Watch - I warrant you the Rogues have got Pistols, if they have, says I, we'll send the Dog in first and he won't value their Pistols, for he don't know a Pistol from a Broom-stick. Then Bob shall go with his Gun, and Fire upon them, and I'll hide myself behind the Door, till the Danger is over. But all this wou'd not make her easy. And so being willing to obey my Wife's orders, I ran to the Watch as fast as if I was running for an Estate, and brought them with me: But when we came to the Door they were so full of their good breeding, that they stood disputing who should enter first: I was vext at it, for I thought their Noise would alarm the Rogues within, and so it proved, for presently I heard a Window slap to. Now, thinks I, they have made their Escape Backwards, and I have watch'd all Night for nothing. So I push'd in foremost, and ran into the Kitchen; I saw no Body at first, but looking into the Closet, there stood the Prisoner, squeez'd in a Corner bolt upright, with a Plaisterer's Lathing-hammer in his Hand. I Knock'd him down, and catch'd him by the Collar as he fell. His Head run with Blood, and I was sorry to see it; but I thought it was better so, than he should serve me worse with his Hammer. I took the Hammer from him - Here it is - And this Knife, but it is not worth a Fill of a Farthing. When I had pull'd him out and secur'd him, the Watch came in to my Assistance.

Prisoner. What do you say?
Court. Show him the Charge in writing, [Then a Paper was shewn him.]
Prisoner. I can't read.
Court. Prosecutor, could you make him hear when he was apprehended.
Prosecutor. He pretended to be deaf then.
Court. Is there no Body belonging to Newgate, that knows whether he can hear or not ?
Whitesides. He could hear sometimes when they baul'd to him in Newgate.
Court. Then we must make him hear now.
Whitesides, bauling, the Court will make you hear.
Prisoner. Indeed I am quite deaf.
Court. If he remains obslinate he must be press'd.
Whitesides, bauling. The Court says, you must be press'd to Death if you won't hear!
Prisoner. Ha!
Court. Read the Law - Batlet the Executioner first tye his Thumbs.

Prisoner. My dear Lord, I am deaf as the Ground.
Executioner. Guilty or not guilty?
Prisoner. My sweet, sugar, precious Lord, I am deaf indeed, and have been so these ten Years.
Executioner. Guilty or not guilty?
Court. Hold him there a little - Now loosen the Cord, and give him a little Time to consider of it; but let him know what he must expect if he continues obstinate, for the Court will not be trifled with.

Then the Prisoner was taken, away but in five Minutes was brought back again and pleaded not Guilty.

            . I am an Engraver. Two Gold Plates, and a Gold Rim of a Snuff-box belonging to my L Harvey, and a Gold Tweezer Case of Mr Dutems were delivered to me to do some work to them. They were lost out of my Drawers on the 25th of January, and not hearing of them in three Days, I advertised them the Monday following, with a Reward of 10 Guineas, to the Person who brought them to Mr. Dutems, at the Golden Cup in Leicester-Square. And the same Night the Prisoner, (who is my Apprentice
) and 
               
                  Peter 
                  Hales 
               



            , Mr. Dutems's Apprentice, came to me at a House where I was, and told me with a great deal of Joy, that they had heard news of the Box, and then they shew'd me a Letter.
Prisoner. was it I, or 
               
                  Peter 
                  Hales 
               



            , who gave you the Letter.
R. M. I can't be certain which, - But here is the Letter.
Mr. Dutems. I receiv'd this Letter by the 
               
                  Penny 
                  Post 
               



            , and sent it by my Apprentice to Mr. Manisire.

Court. Let the Letter be read.
Clerk reads.
`To Mr. Dutems at the Golden Cup, in `Leicester-Square. Send the Boy or Girl, of `the Person from whom the Things were took, `with the Money this Night'. [the Letter is torn in this place, and here's something wanting] `Shoulder of Mutton fields, let them `be there by Eleven. Send nobody with them. `Let them be in a Red Coat or Gown.
`P. S. None but them will have it, and `they must bring this Letter, I shall drop it `first and so let them the Money.
At 11 a Clock I and the Prisoner, with some of my Friends, went to the Shoulder of Mutton-fields: but not caring to venture the 10 Guineas, before I saw some probability of getting the Goods, we waited at some distance, and sent the Prisoner without the Money, to see if the Man was there, and brought the Goods. He went, and return'd in a little time, and said to us; I have met the Man, and he ask'd me if I had brought the Money. I told him no, for my Master was afraid he had not got the Things. He told me that he had, and put the Top of the Tweezer Case in my Hand, and jingled the other things in his Pocket; and then he bid me come to morrow Night at the same Hour, and bring the Money, but let nobody come with me. So we returned home, and went again the next Night: but having some suspicion of the Prisoner, I sent two of my Friends, a little before, (without the Prisoner's knowledge) to watch if any body came to him. But neither of them are here. For one of them can't speak English, and the other (Mr. Costeau ) is now a Prisoner in the Fleet. We took Arms with us; but when we came to the Field, the Prisoner pretended to be afraid, and desir'd to have a Brace of Pistols. I let him have one, and bid him fire it off if the Man went to take the Money from him without delivering the Goods. So giving him the 10 Guineas, he went towards the appointed part of the Field, and we lay perdue. In a quarter of an Hour we heard the Pistol fir'd; upon which we ran towards the Place, and saw the Prisoner struggling with a Man. I took that Man to be the Thief, and was going to shoot him, but was afraid of killing the Prisoner. But when I came quite up to them, I found that Man was my Friend Costeau. We searched the Prisoner, and found a Guinea in his Pocket, he said the Man gave it him in goodwill. I ask'd him why he fir'd then? and he answer'd, because he saw 2 Men coming along. I ask'd him what he had done with the other 9? He said he had given them to the Man for the Goods. Mr. Costeau said, that no Man came to the Prisoner.
Court. You should have brought Mr Costeau hither by a Habea Crpus.
E. M. I have been at a considerable Charge already about this Affair - we went to the Salmon and Ball, and I told the Prisoner I suspected he had hid the Money in the Bank. He said, Do you think I would serve you so? But three of the Company took Links, and went back to see if they could find it. While they were gone the Prisoner call'd me aside, and said it was Necessity that drove him to do what he had done, and beg'd that I would not prosecute him; for if I did, he was ruined. I told him, his best way would be, to make a plain Confession; and then he own'd he had hid 9 Guineas in the Bank. Upon this we went out, and met the three Men coming back with their Links. The Prisoner desir'd the Links might be put out, or keep at a distance, and so he went to the Place in the Dark, and went into the Ditch, and brought out the Money.
Prisoner. Did not I describe the Man to be in a Lac'd hat and a Great-coat.
E. M. Yes; the first Night.
P. And the second Night, I told you which way he went, and that he was not gone 20 Yards off when you came up to me.
Mr. Dutems. I am a Jeweller, and Goldsmith. My Lord Harvey gave me a Family-Box to fit up. Mr. Manisire had it from me, and after sometime, he told me, it was lost. We advertised it; and the same Evening I received the Letter that was produced in Court. I sent my Servant with it to Mr. Manisire: But his Servant (the Prisoner) came, and told me his Master was not at home. I sent them both back to look for him, and at last they found him. We thought it was not  safe to send the Prisoner alone with 10 Guineas, for fear Somebody, who might have seen the Advertisement, might wait at the Place, and Rob him - I never mistrusted the Prisoner, because he always behaved well.

            . I went with the Rest to the Field. When we came near the Place, we sent the Boy (the Prisoner) before, and then we laid down on the Grass - It was about the middle of the Field. He went about half a Field's length, and returned in 6 or 7 Minutes. When he came to where we lay, he started, and said, O is it you? I have met my Chap; he was very civil, and said, young Man be civil to me, and I'll be civil to you It was not a foggy Night; for as we lay down, we could see the Hedges at a reasonable Distance: But we saw Nobody but the Prisoner. - The next Night, Mr Costeau and another Frenchman went beforehand to hide themselves in a Ditch, and we follow'd - We came to an Alehouse, and mark'd some of the Guineas unknown to the Prisoner, and then wrapt them in a Paper, and put them into his Stock, and so set forward. He told us we might go 2 or 3 Fields farther, till we came to the Bridge. I had one pair of Pistols, and his Master had another. I lent the Prisoner one of mine, and he went towards the Place, which was about 60 Yards off. He fired his Pistol, and we ran up. At first we scarce knew Friends from Foes. Mr. Costeau had got hold of the Prisoner, and said, Aye, you are the Thief. Says the Prisoner, I have got the Things, and the Man is gone over the Bar-gate that way. I follow'd, but it was Knee deep, and I could go no farther; and so we return'd to the Salmon and Ball. I was one of the 3 who first went back from thence, to look for the Money. And as we returned, the second Time towards the Alehouse, we met the Prisoner and the rest of our Company. Somebody said, the Prisoner had confest, and was going to fetch the Money; but he would have the Links put out, and so they were. Then he would do nothing before me and Mr. Costeau; upon which we staid at a little Distance, and the Prisoner went into the Ditch, where he hid himself. His Master call'd to us, Hist! Hist, we came forward, and he said, he believ'd he was gone. We call'd the Prisoner, but he would not answer; but at last his Master tumbled over him. Then the Prisoner said, he must have a Link, and I went back to the Ale-house and brought one. At my Return, Mr. Manisire shew'd me the Money, and I knew it to be the same by the Marks.

            . At 9 at Night, my Master told me he had received a Letter, and sent me with it to the Prisoner's Master; but he was not at home. I told the Prisoner, the Thief was found, and he must meet him in the Shoulder of Mutton-Fields. He said, he would not venture his Life for his Master, nor never a Man in the World - At last he found his Master - I went with them that Night to the Salmon and Ball, and thence over 3 or 4 Fields; the Prisoner went before, and we lay down in the middle of the Field. He soon returned, and said it was no Bite, for he had met his Chap, who had shewn him the Top of the Tweezer-case, and chinked the rest of the Things in his Pocket. When I first came to the Place, says he, I walk'd about, and the Man came out of the Ditch, and walked about too; and then he said, young Man do me no Harm, and I'll do you none. Next Night we went again, and the Prisoner went a Field or 2 before us; and then he returned, and said, He was afraid, and desired us to come nearer, which we did; and he went forward again. In a little time he whistled, and fired a Pistol; upon which we all ran up, and a Man met me, and clapt a Pistol to my Breast. He did not know me in the dark, nor I him, till he spoke, and then I found he was one of the Frenchmen who went before hand to watch the Prisoner. Coming all into the Shoulder of Mutton-Path, Mr. Manisire searched the Prisoner, and found a Guinea in his Pocket; and when we came to the Salmon and Ball, we agreed to be searched all round, that no Exceptions might be taken, by searching some, and not others. After the Search, 3 of the Company would go back with Links, to see if the Prisoner had hid no Money in the Bank; and while they were gone, the Prisoner call'd his  Master aside into another Room. I don't know what Discourse they had together; but when they came out, we 3 likewise went to the Shoulder-of-Mutton-Fields to look for the Money. We met the other 3 with Links, and the Prisoner desired they might be put out, which was done; and coming near the Place, there was a Farmer with a Lanthorn looking for the Money too; for I suppose he had heard something of the Matter. Mr. Manisire beckon'd for the Farmer to go away; and then beckon'd me to go away too, which I did, and left them in the dark.
Prisoner. The Things were lost on Friday Morning. I advis'd my Master to get some Bills printed for the stopping them. He did not approve of this, but advertised them on the Monday following, and the same Evening Mr. Dutems receiv'd a Letter, to send me or the Girl to meet the Man in the Field. I went with my Master and several others; but they stopt on this side the Place appointed, and sent me forward. When I had walk'd about for 2 or 3 Minutes, a tall thin Man in a laced Hat call'd to me, and said, I believe you are the young Man - have you brought the Money? No, says I. Why so? says he. Because, says I, my Master is afraid you have not got the Goods. Yes, but I have, says he, for here they be; and with that he put a Part of them in my Hand, and bid me come next Night and bring the Money, and be sure to come alone. So I went back to my Master, and we all went home, and came again next Night. My Master proposed, that I should give the Thief 10 Counters instead of Guineas; but I was afraid the Thief would discover the Cheat, and so my Life would be in Danger, and therefore I would not undertake it. Then my Master gave me ten Guineas: But as I went along, I began to consider, that my Master would be very glad to save his ten Guineas, and so I hid 9 Guineas in the Bank, and gave the Thief 10 Counters, and he return'd me one for my Civility.
Court. Was any Counters found upon the Prisoner when he was search'd.
Mr. Dubois. I found no Counters about him.
Mr. Manisire. Nor I, and yet we searched him every where; all his Pockets, his Coat, Shoes and Stockings, after we had found one Guinea, in hopes of finding the Rest.
Court. The Prisoner gives a good Reason for refusing to impose the Counters upon the Thief, for he says, he was afraid of a Discovery; and this appears natural; but it's by no means natural to suppose, that this Terror should vanish, and his Mind should change so suddenly. And it's very unaccountable, that he should hide only 9 Guineas in the Bank: If he did it for Security, why did he not hide all the 10? And if he intended to return the Money to his Master, why did he so long conceal where it was, and pretend he had given it to the Thief?
Prisoner. When I had concluded to impose upon the Thief, by giving him Counters instead of Guineas for the Goods, I confess, that, having such an Opportunity, I did design afterwards to defraud my Master of the Money, and therefore I put one Guinea in my Pocket, to make believe, that I had really given the Thief the Money, (tho' I gave him only the Counters) and that he had return'd me that Guinea for my Trouble.
Mr. Bowen. The Prisoner was my Scholar, I have known him 4 Years. I taught him Writing and Arithmetick, and he always behaved very well and deservingly.
Juryman. Pray my Lord let the School-master see the Letter.
Mr. Bowen. I don't take this to be his Writing. 'T is nothing like what he wrote when he was with me.
Court. No doubt but a Person would disguise his Hand on such an Occasion; but sure you can distinguish betwixt a natural and a feign'd Hand - Do you think this is natural?
Mr. Bowen. I can't say as to that.
A great many Witnesses appear'd to the Prisoner's Reputation, and gave him a very good Character.
Court. To Mr. Manisire. Did you ever propose to deliver the Counters to the Prisoner.
Mr. Manisire. No; I did not, but some such Thing was mentioned.

Mr. Dubois. It was I who propos'd it, upon which the Prisoner said, he would not go for the World. Then said his Master; well, give him 10 Guineas. Pray don't go to deceive me now, says the Prisoner, for it may be of very ill Consequence.
The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

                  , in his House
            , Feb. 28
.
Mr. Kendrick. On the 28th of February, I lost a Pair of silver Candlesticks out of my House in George-Yard Lombard-street


. I enquired who had been there that Day, and was told, that the Prisoner had been to visit one of my Servants. I sent for her next Morning, and took her and my Servant with some others before Sir 
               
                  Edward 
                  Bellamy 
               



             to be sworn, and the Prisoner was as ready to swear as any of them. But Sir Edward said he suspected her, and advised us to search her Lodgings, and my Servant went, and found the Candlesticks there; but the Crest was taken out as nicely as if it had been done by a Silversmith. I went to see her in the New Jail in Southwark, and she confest the Fact, and said that she took the Crest out her self with the Scissars.


                  Jeremy 
                  Amat 
               



            . The Prisoner came to my Fellow-Servant. She went away about 5, and about 7 the Candlesticks were miss'd. Next Morning I fetch'd her from her Lodgings in Vine-Yard in Southwark, and we all went before Sir 
               
                  Edward 
                  Bellamy 
               



             to be sworn. Sir Edward advised us to search her Lodgings, and I and 2 more went. Mrs. Lee her Landlady produced them in 5 Minutes; and then we went before Justice Nichols. The Prisoner was committed to the New-Jail, where she confest to me and my Fellow-Servant, that she put the Candlesticks in her Gown, one in each side, and pin'd them up; and that she took out the Crest the same Night with her Scissars.


                  Mary 
                  Sawyer 
               



            . These are the Candlesticks - The Prisoner came to see me between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon. She staid but a little while, and about 7 they were miss'd. I went to her Lodgings next Morning; and she came readily, and 6 of us went before Sir Edward, and took our Oaths - Then  we went again to the Prisoner's Lodging, and 
               
                  Jane 
                  Howland 
               



             (who lodg'd with the Prisoner) beckon'd me down, and asked if any thing was lost? I said, Yes; a pair of Silver Candlesticks - Then follow me, says she, and going with her, we met Mrs. Lee, with the Candlesticks under her Apron - and she told me the Name was scratch'd out. I said to the Prisoner, Mary, how could you do so? She made no Answer, but when she came before the Justice, she own'd that she took them, and eras'd the Crest.


                  Jane 
                  Lee 
               



            . The Prisoner lodg'd five Weeks at my House, and behav'd well. On the 1st of March about Noon, I went to make my Bed, and found the Candlesticks under. I was surpriz'd, and ask'd my Husband and 
               
                  Jane 
                  Howland 
               



             if they knew how they came? They said, No. I desir'd my Husband to ask Advice about it, and I produced the Candlesticks in the open Yard, before Mr. Kendrick sent to search for them.
The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

            . I drank 2 or 3 Bottles of Wine with the Prisoner, at the Key and Garter in Drury-lane


. When the Reckoning came to be paid, I pulled out some Money and this Medal among it. She asked me to let her look on it, and so She took it out of my Hand; and put it into her Mouth; and then told me she had swallow'd it. Mrs Jones the Landlady, let her out at the back Door. I desir'd Mrs Jones to call the Watch; but She bid me do it my self. I ran out and catch'd the Prisoner; and getting Assistance, carried her to St. Martin's Round-house, Mrs Jones came, and said, if I'd take her Word, the Prisoner should be forthcoming on the Morrow, and I shou'd have the Medal in 3 Days, if I would give the Prisoner the Value of it in Silver.
Prisoner. Was not you with other Whores in Windsor-Court, where you drank 5 or 6 Quarterns of Brandy with them, and then they beat you?
Prosecutor. Yes, I had been up the Court with another Woman, but she wrong'd me of nothing.
Prisoner. But was not you a fighting with them? and did not I come and take your part, when they were a beating of you?
Prosecutor. There was a little of a Debate - but no Fighting as I remember.
Prisoner. You was drunk, and don't know what there was - I am sure you begg'd of me to see you safe out of the Court, for you was afraid they'd quite demolish you; and when we came into the Lane, you invited me to drink a Glass of Wine for my Civility.

Prisoner. Did I say, I robb'd him of it?
Ewen. I don't say you did.
Prisoner. Did not I say he gave it me?
Ewen. I believe you might

            , Constable. In the Round-house the Prisoner said, She had swallow'd the Medal; but if the Man would give her the Value of it, he should have it again; and she said he gave it her.
Prisoner. And so he did about 2 in the Morning. And the Woman of the House knows it; for she was in the Room all the while - but she is not here, because they want to prosecute her for keeping a Baudy-house.
Prosecutor. Why did you run away, if I gave it you?
Prisoner. I did not run.
Prosecutor. You are a saucy lying B -
The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

            . My name was Morris when I was 
               
                  robb'd
               


            , but I have since been married. The Prisoner was my Servant
, and had lived with me three Quarters of a Year - She asked me to go out to see her Child, and she staid out several Nights, which made me mistrust her; and when she came again, I examin'd my Trunk, and mist the Goods. She confest she had pawn'd them at 
               
                  Joe

            's, in Villars-street. He refused to let me have them, without laying down the Money they were pawn'd for, which was 6 Guineas; and so my Husband got a Search Warrant.
Humphry Fortune. Missing the Goods, I tax'd the Prisoner. She fell on her Knees and begg'd Pardon, and said, she'd make me amends, for she had some Goods of her own, and would sell them and redeem mine, which she said she had pawn'd at Jo. Euthard's, at the 3 Bowls in Villars-street. He would not produce them till I got a Search-Warrant and he was very unwilling then; for he  brought them before the Justice at 4 or 5 times.


                  Joseph 
                  Uthard 
               



            . The Prisoner pawn'd the Goods with me at several times, in October, November, and December. She came in her Mistresses Name, and I knew her Mistress used to send to her, and a former Maid, to pledge things at my House; and sometimes she came her self, and she own'd that she sent the plate by the Prisoner - I shew'd them the Goods when they demanded it.
Prisoner. My Mistress sent me to pawn some of the Things, and the rest I pawn'd for my own Use - They put me in here last Sessions, but fetch'd me out themselves, because the Goods were laid in a wrong Name.
Mrs Fortune. I did send her with 5 Spoons, and that was all, and I sent her again with Money to redeem them.
Court. When were you married?
Fortune. The 3 of January last
Uthard. They did not come for the Goods till the 15 of January.
The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

            . About 12 on Saturday Night, having just let a Customer out, I was going to sweep the Shop, and my Back being turn'd, I thought I heard some Body behind me, upon which I look'd, but seeing no Body in the Shop, I ran to the Door, and took the Prisoner, with the Wig-box in his Hand, but the Wig was taken out. I know the Wig was in it a few Minutes before, for I put it in myself, and set it on the Shelf; and I knew the Box, because I myself had writ Mr. Bright's Name on it. The Prisoner said, he found the Box at the Door.

            , alias Cock-my-Chin. The Prisoners and I, had been a stealing Oil that Night, at the Old-Swan. We got two Kettles full, and sold it to 
               
                  John 
                  Gill 
               



            , a Hempdresser, in Bridewell-Alley, and then going over London-Bridge, we saw Mr. Dun's Shop open. Stay, says 
               
                  Jack 
                  Jones 
               



            , I'll go and get something. So we staid at the Door, and he went in, and brought out a Wig in a Box; I took the Wig, and put it into my Bosom, and the Man came out, and seiz'd Jack. His Mother seeing this, bid me follow her to Plumb-pudding-Square on London-Bridge. So she ran away, and I ran after her to Plumb-pudding-Square, and gave her the Wig. She ask'd me to go home with her, but I refus'd, and went and took up my Lodging on the Pipes, that belong to the Water-house at the Bridge. The Watch found me there, and carry'd me to the Constable, he threaten'd to send me to Bridewell for a Black-guard; but I promis'd never to lie there any more, and so he let me go. On Sunday Morning I heard, that Jack was in the Poultry-Compter, I borrow'd 6 d. of the Hempman, and went to Jack, and gave him, 2 d. - On Tuesday I went to Lingard's Gin-shop in the Mint, where the Wig was pawn'd for 17 s. I ask'd for some Money, but Mrs. Lingard kick'd me out of Doors. Then I met 
               
                  Jack 
                  Baldwin 
               



            , and another Black-Shoe-Boy, eating a Marrow-bone, I ask'd them to give me a bit, for I was very hungry; but they said, there was 2 Guineas bid for taking me up, and so they got a Constable and took me.



                  Elizabeth 
                  Jones 
               



            . I was not with them that Saturday Night, for having been hard at Work all Day, I went home to Bed. And next Morning, as I was cleaning Shoes, I saw the Evidence, and ask'd him where my Son was? He damn'd me for a Bitch, and said, my Son had stole his Blacking-pot - A Porter afterwards told me, my Son was in the Compter.


                  John 
                  Jones 
               



            . I own I was with the Evidence at the Old-Swan, but left him there, and went with the Kettle of Stuff to the Hempman's, and when I came back, I found the Wig-box at the Barber's Door - Yesterday a Woman brought me 2 d. for some Victuals, and said, she saw the Evidence, and that he had told her, he swore against my Mother only because she abus'd him on Sunday -
Cock-my-Chin. It was you that draw'd me away when I liv'd at Mrs. Bradley's, in Pudding-Lane, where I had a Shilling a Week for cleaning Shoes - I know all the Butchers in East-cheap, and they can give me a Character.

In June and July, 1731, the Prosecutor's Family being in the Country, his House (in St. Margaret's Westminster


) was enter'd, his Boxes, Chests, and Cabinet broke open, the Drawers left on the Floor, and the Goods in the Indictment, with other rich Furniture, &c. taken away. Above a Bushel of Soot, lay on the Dining room Hearth, and was thought to be left there, to make believe, that some Body came down the Chimney; but it sifted fine, no bits of Mortar were among it, nor any Footsteps in it; and besides, the Chimney was hooded at top, and the Lock of the Street-door was out of order.
The Goods were advertis'd, and in August, 1731, the Prisoner offer'd to pawn those in the Indictment to Mr. Pretty, in Vere-Street, and being examin'd how he came by them, he said, they were lent him to raise Money to christen his Child, and then he ran, away and left the Goods.

            . The Squire came into Mrs. Moor's Brandy-shop at the lower End of King-street, Westminster


, about 10 at Night. The Prisoner, and another Woman came in, and he desir'd they might have a Glass of what they would drink; which I gave them. He took out 7 Guineas and laid them on the Counter. I ask'd him why he pull'd out his Money in a publick Shop, and bid him put it up again. The Prisoner took it up, and counted it over, and I bid him take care of it. And she said she would call a Coach, and see him home; but he would have no Coach, and desir'd her not to be in a hurry. Other Customers coming in, I turn'd my back to draw some Liquor, and the Prisoner went away. The Squire staid a Quarter of an Hour after, and said his Money was gone.
Court Is he here?
Griffith. No; he's a Commander of a Man of War
, and is gone to Sea.

Captain Davis ask'd the Prisoner to drink, she wanted him to go out with her, but he said he'd tell his Money first, and so he laid 8 Guineas on the Counters she took it up, and slipt one Guinea into a Creature's Hand behind her, and then offer'd to return him 7. He said that was not all, but she swore and curs'd that she had but 7, and then she swept it all up, and left him, and 2 Soldiers went with her. I follow'd, and she was catch'd in Duke-street, but the Soliders let her go again; and afterwards she was taken at the Valiant Trooper in Bow-street, between 11 and 12, and I went to see the Captain home, to the 2 Brewers - He was very much fuddled.
Prisoner. You are a vile Wretch, you have been 3 times in Bridewell - I was at the Shop for a Quartern of Gin, but I saw not a Soul of a Man there. And when I wa carried before the Justice, the Captain did not know me, for he asked which was the Woman? The Jury found her 

               Guilty

John Laws. Near 11 at Night, going by the Lock and Key, in Smithfield, the Prisoner catc'd hold of me, and ask'd me to give her a D am I went with her to a Brandy-shop in Duck Lane


; I stay'd there half an Hour, and we had three Quarterns of Brandy. I was a little Suspicious, and therefore felt several times for my Watch, and still found it in my Pocket. But by and by, she suddenly call'd the Woman of the House, and gave her the Money for the Brandy, at which I was a little Surpriz'd, and feeling again for my Watch, I miss'd it. I held fast hold of the Prisoner, and call'd for a Constable, upon which two Men, who were in the Foreroom, for she and I were in a private Room backwards, came and hussled me about, and one of them pretended to be a Constable, and order'd me to quit her, but however I would not let her go, but carry'd her to the Watch-house in Cloth-Fair, and the Constable committed us both to the Compter - Next Day she offer'd to return the Watch for 2 Guineas, and afterwards the Man at the Brandy-shop promis'd to help me to it for a Guinea and a Half.

            . I keep a Chandler's-shop
, the End of Leather-Lane , in Liquor-Pond-Street


, I counted 5 l to pay my Baker, and put it in a blue and White striped Ticking-cap. The next Day my Soap-boiler's Man came, and I took out this Cap, and paid him 13 s. out of the 5 l. and several Customers being in the Shop, I twisted the Cap up, and laid it by the End of the Counter, and threw a Cloth over it. The Prisoner came for some Small-beer and a Dram. Betty, says I, 'tis a busy Time (for it was Saturday Morning) and therefore don't trouble me. So she went to that Part of the Shop where the Money lay, and serv'd herself, and then walk'd backwards and forwards a good while, and then went away. I miss'd the Money in half an Hour after she was gone, and suspected her, because no Body else was at that End of the Counter while the Money lay there.

            .  The Prisoner came into the King's-Head, Parker' Lane, with a little Fellow that she had pick'd up in the King's-Road She pull'd out a Handful of Silver, swearing and throwing it about the House like mad She treated any Body, and spent 4 or 5 s. standing, while I was at Dinner. At Night I heard Mr Dixon had been robb'd by such a Woman; and she was taken next Morning in her Room - She swore prodigiously, and damn'd her Eyes if she knew any thing of the Matter; but when she was told of her being at the King's-Head, and spending and throwing the Money about there she confess'd that is was Mr. Dixon's Money, and that she took it out of his Shop but she had none of it left, for she had spent it and thrown it away, she could not tell how.

Capt.
 Ketteridge. The Goods were lost out of my Ship on the 15th of July in the Night. On the 17th I went to buy a Hat at Ben. Green's in Rosemary-lane, and there I found one of those Hats I had lost - Green produced Lucas, from whom he said he had the Hat; and by Lucas's Information the Prisoners were taken.
Ben. Green. Lucas brought this Hat to me to dress - The Captain came to buy a Hat, for he said all his Hats were stolen out of his Ship. He bought one, and in an Hour afterwards came for another. Here's a Hat would do for you now, says I, but it's none of mine, it was brought to be dress'd; and so I shew'd him the Hat that Lucas left. Why this is one of the Hats that I have lost, says the Captain. Is it? says I, then I can help you to the Man I had it from. And so I took Lucas at a House he frequented in Wells-street


                  Joseph 
                  Lucas 
               



            . I and the two Prisoners were drinking at Reynold's Brandy-shop, in Weil street, near the Watch-house, in Rag-Fair, and about 10 at Night we went from thence to Iron-Gate, where we stole a Boat and a pair of Sculls, and row'd about to see what we could get. About 12 a Clock we came to The Happy Return, near King James's-Stairs


, and seeing no Light on Board, we wrenched open the Cabbin-window. Then Newell struck a Light, and lighting a Candle in a dark Lanthorn, he gave it to Martin, who went in at the Window, but came out again presently, and said he heard a Woman speak to a Child. Upon this I pull'd off my Shoes and crept in, and brought out 2 Coats, 2 Petticoats, 3 Hats, a silver Watch, a pair of silver Buckles, some Linen, and other Things. My Wife sold the Watch for 36s. I kept 12s. for my own Share, and gave the Prisoners 12s. a-piece. Martin allow'd 4s. 6d. for the Buckles, he reckoned 18 d. for his own Share, and gave us 18 d. a-piece. We sold all the rest, except one Hat and a Handkerchief, to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Baily 
               



            , who is gone off, for 50s. We spent half a Crown of the Money, and divided 15s. 10d. a-piece. I carry'd the Hat next Day to Green's to have it dress'd, and he would have given a Shilling for it; but I told him I could get more. However, he bought the Handkerchief of me.

            , Headborough, in White-chapel. I took Lucas, and he inform'd against the Prisoners - Newell confess'd before Justice Lade, that he was concern'd in this Fact.
Newell. I made my self a voluntary Evidence against Lucas, and one 
               
                  John 
                  Faucet 
               



            , for robbing this Ship; but Lucas's Friends had Money, and so he was admitted to be an Evidence.
Keeper. Newell was an Evidence this time Twelvemonth.*

I was very much frighted, took out my Purse, and threw it upon the Grass, and ran away as fast as I could. The Man was immediately taken by some Person who jump'd over the Wall.
Court. Is the Prisoner the Man?
Miss M. TREVOR. I was so frighted that I could not take much notice of him -  I did not see that he took up my Purse I had it again, and it had not been opened.

            . I saw the Man coming towards us with a Pistol. I was frighted, and ran away.
Mr. Justice Deveil. The Prisoner was brought before me, and made a voluntary Confession, which was taken in Writing, and sign'd by him.
Then the Confession was produced and read in Court. It was to this Effect, That being lately come from on Board the Namure, and being in want of Money, on the 19th of July, about eight in the Evening, he went into the Queen's-walk, in the Upper-Park, and seeing two young Gentlewomen walking by themselves, he pull'd out a Mask, which he had brought on purpose to rob with, and going up to them; presented a Pistol, and demanded their Money. One of them dropt a Purse on the Ground, but he did not take it up; for they squaling out aloud, he took to his Heels, and threw away his Pistol and Mask.
The Jury found him

, Aug. 5

Edward Mason. On the 5th of August, between 2 and 3 in the Morning, I happen'd to be in Liquor, and as I was going along Fleet-street, I was pick'd up by what we may call - not a Woman, I suppose - but - a Mistress of the Town, and I was taken into Sword and Hanging-Alley, or Hanging and Sword Alley, or some such a cramp sort of a Place.
Court. What happen'd after you were carry'd into this Alley?
Mason. Carry'd? - No, have a care of that, I was not so drunk as that came to neither - I was not carried - I walk'd or as a Body may say, I was conducted, by this Woman, as I took her to be; but I can't be positive what she was, Because I did not examine her, and I would not swear to a Thing that I was not sure of.
Court. Was it either of the Prisoners?
Mason. No; no, it was none of the Prisoners - But I was conducted up into a Room where I found the Prisoners. We had 2 or 3 Quarterns of Cherry-brandy, and other Liquors to the Quantity of 2 or 3 Shillings. Then they persuaded me to go to Bed, because they saw me in Liquor; and so I began to strip, and in the first Place the Shoes - Aye, I suppose the Shoes must come off first; and then to be sure the Breeches must come next, and the Breeches I laid upon the Table, and then -
Court. You went to Bed?
Mason. No; I don't suppose I went to Bed - But I was making Preparations to go to Bed, and so far is right. And when I had laid my Breeches upon the Table, the Prisoner, Betty Cook, snatches them up, and runs down Stairs with them. I cry'd out, Stop Thief ! my Breeches! my Breeches! she has got my Breeches, and all that I have - And indeed it was all that I had at that time.
Court. All that you had?
Mason. That is, all that I had in my Breeches, when my Breeches were off - Take me right - I don't say t'other and all - No, no - that was all safe.
Court. What did you lose?
Mason. My Watch, and two half Guineas, and 30 s. may I believe I could swear to a Guinea more, for I had 4 or 5 l. not long before I met the Woman, and I had been in no other Company that Night.
Court. Where did you get fuddled?
Mason. At the Tavern along with some Friends.
Court. Then you were in Company?
Mason. Yes; in Company with Men, but with none of the other female Sex, that was what I meant, for I was not so drunk as not to know one from t'other - I left my Friends at a Tavern upon Fleet-street-hill, and at several other Places, and I had my Money and Watch then, and that was not much above half an Hour before I lost my Breeches
Court. Did you follow the Prisoner Cook when she went away with your Breeches?
Mason. No; the other Prisoner Bartlett bolted the Door, and would not let me run after my Breeches.
Court. Was the Bolt within side the Room where you were?
Mason. Yes.
Court. And could not you open it then?
Mason. I might have done to, but if I had where should I have found my Breeches?
Court. Did you ever get your Breeches again?
Mason. Yes? a Man brought them to me afterwards, but there was nothing in them except this Rule.
Court. When you were so drunk as you say, could you take so much notice of Cook as to know her again, and especially as you had been such a little while in her Company?
Mason. Yes; for I'll tell you what - It's just like as when a Man was frighted, his Senses strike quicker than ordinary at such a Time.
Court. That's a new Piece of Philosophy.
Prisoner Cook. Did I bring you into the, House?
Mason. No; but you took my Breeche that I'll swear, and I was not over and above drunk neither, for I remember that you were brought out of the Bed, and had no Stockings on, because as I have heard since, you were famous for slight of Hand - And I found you again, about a 11 a Clock, the same Morning, with the Watch upon you - No, that's a Mistake, for you were upon the Watch.


                  Francis 
                  Skelborn 
               



            , Constable of St. Brides. The Prosecutor told me, that he had lost his Breeches in Gale's House, in Hanging-Sword-Alley


, upon which I took up the Landlady, and Bartlett, the Girl, and carry'd them before Alderman Brocas, and soon afterwards I heard that Cook was at another House in the same Alley. I went and thither and found her upon a Bed. As soon as we came in, I perceived her take something off the Bed, and put it in a Chair, and then she sat down upon it. She desired us to go out a little, because she wanted to make some necessary Occasion. You Saucy Toad, says I, get up! and then we found the Prosecutor's Watch under her. I carry'd her to the Bull-Head, and there she was so outrageous, that she swore, and damn'd, and broke all the Windows, and we were forced to send for a pair of Handcuffs from the Compter, before we could manage her - At last she offered the Prosecutor 18 s. to make the Matter up.


                  Robert 
                  Misset 
               



            . I went with the Prosecutor and Constable to Cook's Room. The Prosecutor said, That's the Woman. She got into the Chair, and said she wanted to make Water - I swear to the Words Verbatim, and I took the Watch from the left side of her Buttock - Yes, I say, her Buttock, for I think that is a proper Word.
Prisoner Cook. She that carry'd the Prosecutor into the House, was more likely to rob him than I.
Court. But how came the Watch in your Possession?
Cook. The Woman that pick'd him up, was a little Woman big with Child, and her Husband brought the Watch to me, and desired me to Pledge it for him.
The Jury 

               acquitted
             Mary Bartlett, and found Elizabeth Cook, 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

Prosecutor. On Sunday Night between 9 and 10, I met with some Company, and went to drink with them at a House in Newtoner's-Lane, where I left my Watch-case for the Reckoning, and then going out I met with the Prisoner and three more. They ask'd me to drink, and said it should cost me nothing. So they pull'd me into a Gin-shop; I ask'd what was to pay, for they promis'd to treat me. I did not expect they would. They said there was a Crown to pay. I found I was got into ill Company, and therefore pull'd out my Watch, in order to secure it; but the Prisoner snatched it out of my Hand, and ran away. I follow'd her, but could not catch her. Indeed I met with her next Day, and took her up with a Warrant, but I never got the Watch again.
Prisoner. I never saw him before the Monday Morning that he took me up, and then he said he was inform'd by some Neighbours that I had got a Watch that he had lost - But he had pawn'd it a Month before to Bess Thompson.

            , July 23


Mr. Bird. I kept the Ship-Tavern at Temple-Bar




 and was burnt out by the Fire that happen'd there, on the 23d of July, about 2 in the Morning - And afterwards a Man came, and enquir'd, if I had not lost a Silver Cup, and a Brass-candlestick - I knew the Cup was mine by the Mark, but was not so positive to the Candlestick, and therefore did not put it in the Indictment.


                  James 
                  Jemmit 
               



            . I keep a Brandy-shop at the End of Gloucester-Court in White-Cross-street. On the 23d of July between 6 and 7 in the Morning, the Prisoner came to my Shop for a Dram. The Woman had something ty'd up in a Handkerchief, and desir'd me to let her leave it a little while in my Shop, and let Nobody but her have it. So she put it upon the head of a Cask, and they both went away together; the Man came again by himself, in half an Hour, and wanted the Bundle. No, says I, the Woman bid me deliver it to Nobody but herself. Well, says he, then take care of it and don't let her have it except I come with her, for there is something of Value in it. Something of Value? Says I, Then it can never belong to her, for she thinks herself rich when she's worth a Bushel of Cinders - You must know she's a Cinder-Wench - It's no matter for that, says he, there is a Salver Taster in it. So I opens the Handkerchief, and there was a Parcel of Rabbit-skins, a Brass-candlestick, and this Silver-cup. Is this your Taster? Says I, 'tis a good sizeable one! By and by in comes the Woman, and I charges a Constable with them. And upon enquiring I found out the Prosecutor; I had never seen Edesbury before, but the Woman had been several times at my Shop.


                  Sarah 
                  Griffin 
               



            . I had been at Covent-Garden Market, and as I came back I found this man (Edesbury) standing at the Fire. He had got the Cup and Candlestick under his Coat, and he ask'd me if I knew any House where I could leave them for him.


                  Thomas 
                  Edesbury 
               



            . Are not you a lying Toad? Did you ever see me in your Life before - My Lord she's wicked vile Woman, never set Eyes on her in my Days.
Court. It seems you were taken up together.
Edesbury. That's true to be sure; but I never had the least acquaintance with her till that Morning when I happen'd to see her at the Fire - I was drinking at the Woolpack in Petticoat-Inn till 12 at Night, with others of the Craft - The gentle Craft, my Lord; and there was a Prize-shoe to be shewn, and after that I went to see one of my Shop-mates home to St. Martin's lane; and in coming back I saw this Woman at the Fire with these Things in her Apron. You Bitch you, says I, what have you got in your Lap? She said it was something she had found, and then she ask'd where Tom Gilpin was -
Court. 
               
                  Tom 
                  Gilpin 
               



            ? You said you had never seen her before, how came she then to know that you were acquainted with Tom Gilpin?
Edesbury. That's well observed indeed, my Lord - I believe I over-run my self a little there - I have but a bad memory, for I forgot the main Article - Yes, I had seen her before, for I and my Shop-mate and Tom Gilpin, coming from Petticoat-lane, met this Creature in Cheapside and pick'd her up; Tom asked her to go to Drury-lane, and she agreed to it: But there she dropt me, and my Shop-mate went along with Tom; and so I and my Shop mate went to St. Martin's-lane together; and as I came back I met this Bitch at the Fire, and ask'd her what she had got in her Apron, and so she came to ask me where Tom Gilpin was; You Bitch, says I, You have must reason to know where he is, for you were with him last. And then she and I went through Temple Bar into Fleet-street, and turn'd down Chancery-lane, and so came to Fetter lane, and then to Shoe-lane, and down Harp-Alley to Fleet-ditch, and up Fleet-lane to the Old-Baily, and cross Newgate-street to Giltspur-street, and through Pye-Corner into Smithfield, and so to Long-lane, and cross Aldersgate-street to Barbican, and then down Red-Cross-street, and up White-Cross-street to Jemmit's Brandy-shop; and there we drank together, and she left the Things and then we parted.
Court. But you thought fit to call there and demand the Bundle, as if you had aright to it; and it seems you knew there was something of value in it.
Jemmit again. When the Constable came, Edesbury said, for Christ's sake be favourable, or I shall be hang'd for these Things; and he own'd they were taken at the Fire.
Edesbury. I said I believ'd she had stole them there - And has for her part she got drunk, and gave Jemmit a slap of the Chops as she was going into Newgate.
William Drogheda and

                  Williams 
               



             depos'd, that Edesbury had Lodg'd with then, and they took him to be a very honest Fellow.
The Jury found both the Prisoners 

               Guilty
            .

I look'd upon them, and saw they were mark'd with the Three-Tuns, by which I knew they belong'd to the Quaker's Tavern in King-street, Westminster; and thereupon I sent for a Watchman, who apprehended her - Mr. Francia is the Master of that Tavern, but he has put another Man into it.

Then she felt a good while in her Bosom with her left Hand for her Money, and the same time fumbled under her Apron with her right Hand. I suppose she was hiding the piece of Cambletee. Then she said she had left her Purse at home; and so she laid down half a Crown earnest, and said she would go home for her Purse and come again presently; but as she and her Companion were going out at the Door I mist the piece of Cambletee ; the other Woman run up the Street, and the Prisoner into an Entry; I follow'd her, and brought her back, she said she had got nothing, but the piece was afterwards found in that Entry.

            . I am a Pawnbroker
, the Prisoner was Nurse
 to my Boy, she had been with me 4 Months, and last Saturday was 3 Weeks she went away Sick. After which there was a Quarrel betwixt her and one of her Companions; and thereupon I was inform'd that several of my Things had been seen in her Box at her Lodgings in Wild-Court. I went to a House in that Neighbourhood, and sent for her and told her she had robb'd me; she said yes, and so she had. I desired to see her Box, she open'd it, and the first Thing I saw was a Handkerchief of mine which I claim'd. Yes, says she, that is yours, and a great many more Things which you little think of. Some of the Things were my own, and the rest had been Pledged to me. There was in particular a little Doll's Gold-Ring. I asked her if she did not take a Moidore out of my Breeches as they hung up; she said no, but she tookout a Guinea - I lost in all to the value of 12 l. or 14 l. She said she took the Goods at several times at the Ware-house Door. My Ware-house is up Stairs on the same Floor with the Nursery. When a Customer comes to redeem any Thing, 'tis common for us to take the Bag in which are several sorts of Goods, and empty at the Ware-house Door to look for what we want, and when we have found it, we carry it down, and leave the rest of the Things there till we come up again; and the Prisoner took these Opportunities to steal the Goods.

            . I went with my Son John to take the Prisoner up. She own'd that the Handkerchief was his, and many more Things in the Box, and that she took the Guinea out of his Pocket.
This was confirm'd by the Mistress of the Rose-Alehouse, the Corner of Wild Passage where the Prisoner was examin'd.
She call'd several Witnesses to her Character. They depos'd they had known her some Years; that she bore an honest Character, and always behav'd her self well.
The Jury found her

I can't say but I had a very good Character of the Prisoner, or else I should not have taken him for a Lodger. On my leaving my House I removed the Trunk into another Room; I thought it was very light; but my Head was so full of my own Affairs, that I did not then enquire into the Reason of it.
Three or four Witnesses appeared to the Prisoner's Character. They deposed, that they known him several Years, that he was a Taylor

I was the first that made the Discovery; I ask'd Smith how he came by the Pieces? He said, he bought them of a Waterman. Looking farther, I saw some of Mr. Theobald's Timber, and some belonging to the Company. In one of the Pieces the Mark was cut out with an Adz - Mine cost me 31 s. a Load.

Joseph Greathead. On the 21st of October last about 6 in the Evening, as I was going down Snow-Hill


, 3 or 4 Men stopp'd me and buffet'd me about. The Prisoner was one of them, and he push'd me on the Breast thus, and then 3 of them run towards the Conduit. I presently miss'd my Watch, cry'd Stop Thief, pursued the Prisoner and took him within about 10 Yards from where I was robb'd.
Prisoner. Was I coming up the Hill or going, when you saw me first, Mr. Greathead?
Witness. You and your Companions were coming up and met me - I went to the Prisoner twice, when he was in the Counter, and he owned to me there that he was in the Robbery, and his Companions had sent him part of the Money that the Watch was pawn'd for.
Prisoner. Ah Lord! ha, ha, ha!

            . Last Monday I went with Mr. Greathead to see the Prisoner in the Compter - The Prisoner had made an Information and Confession before Alderman Brocas of a great many Robberies that he had been concerned in with several others; and I think two of them were taken; upon which the Prosecutor said to him, Were those two concerned with you in taking my Watch, The Prisoner answered, Yes. Are you sure of it? says the Prosecutor. Yes; reply'd the Prisoner. And adds the Prosecutor. Do you know where the Watch is? No, says t'other, for I was taken up immediately, and they pawn'd it, and sent me part of the Money.
Then the Prisoner's Confession was proved, and read in Court.
He therein says, that he, and others stole a Silver Watch in Leaden-hall-street - a Tuck Sword - a Silver Watch in Queen-street - another Sword - a Gold Watch - a Silver-hilted Sword in Long-Acre - a Silver Watch behind the Exchange - another near Drury Lane - a Gold Watch - a Silver Watch in Fleet-Street - other Watches - and lastly, that on the 21st of October, about 6 at Night, that he, and four more on Snow-Hill, picked the Pocket of Mr. Greathead of a Silver Watch.

, he follow'd his Business, at which he could get 18 s. a Week; and I never saw any ill of him.
The Jury found him

But by good luck, in about a Fortnight, going to a Bawdy-house, not far from my House, on the Backside of Drury-Lane, I met with her. She was lock'd up in a Room, and they denied her to me at first; but when I told them, and stood stifly to it (as well I might, for it was nothing but the Truth) that I had seen her through the Window, I gained Admittance, and there was my Gentlewoman, drest up, I'll warrnt ye, like one of the tip top Madams of the Hundreds. I asked her what she had done with such and such Goods and Money. She said, truly, that she knew nothing of my Money, or my Silver-hilted Sword; but as for the rest of the Things she confest that she had taken them, and pawn'd them to Mr. Hamlin at the Corner of Cole-Yard in Drury-Lane, and some at other Pawn-brokers; and I found them accordingly.

            . The Prosecutor came with a Constable in Disguise, and the Prisoner, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Wheeler 
               



            . The Prosecutor said he wanted to redeem a Coat and Waistcoat that were pawn'd for a Guinea. I asked him who pawn'd 'em. He said his Wife, What's her Name, says I. This is my Wife, says he, pointing to the Prisoner, and her Name is Mary Wheeler. So I brings out the Goods, and then truly they told me the Goods were stolen - Now I can't swear that the Goods were pawn'd by the Prisoner, tho' it's true they were pawned in the Name of Mary Wheeler, and I don't know how it should be she, because I don't know her, and we take in Goods of no Strangers.

                  Newark

Prisoner. I was the Prosecutor's Servant a Month, and I hope he'll give me my Wages before I plead my Cause -
Pros. Wages! You have a good Assurance.
Prisoner. This Man kept a Cook's Shop formerly. Then he was a Pedlar about the Country with hard Ware, and now is a Cobler
, and mends Shoes for his living. When I lived with him he sold a Dram, and let out Lodgings to Gentlemen for two Pence a Night, and if a Gentleman and Lady came together, then he got three Pence for a Bed. His House was a Thorow-fare, and always open to all Comers, and so as I did not like such irregular Doings, I left his House, and provided for myself.
The Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

                   in his House
            , in the Parish of St. Martins in the Fields


, Octob. 27
.
Mr. Allen. The Prisoners were both my Servants
; Thursby came to live with me on the 14th of August last. Brown was my Cook
. They both lay together in a Room, up three Pair of Stairs: My Mother lay in another Room on the same Floor. On the 27th of October my House was broke and robb'd in the Night: I don't know who did it; but we were alarmed by Thursby. She goes first to my Mother, lays her Hand on her Face and wakes her, and tells her there were three Rogues in the House; but desires her not to come out of her Room for fear the Rogues should murder her. Then she goes to the Window and calls out Thieves. The Noise waked me. I got up, and taking the Key of the Door with me, went down Stairs, I found all my Doors and Windows fast, except the Parlor Window, and that was open. The Sash was thrown up, and the two Alarm-Bells were taken and laid down upon the Table. The Drawers were open. The Goods in the Indictment were taken away; besides which, there was a Petticoat dropt, and a Gown half in and half out. Thursby told me that as she was a-bed with Brown she was waked by the Noise of her own Trunk being broke open, and then saw three Men, one in Grey, one in Olive, and one in Black: That two of them had Masks, and the other had a black Crape over his Face, and a long Knife in his Hand, that he threatned to cut their Throats if they did not lye still; that he plunder'd her Trunk, took out her Cloths and a Purse of Money which he chink'd in his Hand, and then they tyed up her Clothes in a Table-Cloth and went away - I called in a Constable: he said. This must be done by your own Servants. I said, I believed my Men to be very honest, and had no suspicion of 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Thursby 
               



            , because she had been robb'd; but Brown had lost nothing, and therefore carried her before a Justice who, committed her to the Gatehouse, where she lay three Days - Three Weeks after this we found a Suit of Thursby's Clothes at Pawn, and they proved to be the same that she said she had been robb'd of: Upon this I carried her before the Justice. At first, she said she had pawn'd no Clothes, but afterwards own'd that those were hers. She was carried before the Justice again the next Day; but as we could prove nothing upon her, he bid her go home again, and not fly from me, for if she did he told her it would be an Argument of Guilt. But notwithstanding this, she left my House and I went next Day to enquire for her at a House in Wapping, where her Mother-in-Law lives: Her Mother-in-Law told me that she had been a Thief to her -
Court. You must not swear to what the Mother-in-Law told ye - Tis no Evidence.
Mrs. Allen. Thursby said she had lost 20 Guineas and the Value of 20 l. in Clothes. One Suit which she said was lost at that time, we afterwards found at Pawn, where it had laid three Weeks before.
Prisoner Thursby. Was not there a Corner-Cupboard full of Plate in the Parlor from whence your Goods were taken?
Mrs. Allen. Yes, there was Plate.
Thursby. As I knew this: it is likely, if I had been concerned in the Robbery, that I would have taken the Gowns and Petticoats and left the Plate?
Court. Did you ever find any of your Goods again?
Mrs. Allen. No, none of them.


                  Mary 
                  Keeble 
               



            . Thursby pawn'd those Clothes to me.
Court. What Clothes?
Mary Keeble. I suppose they were her own. I have them here in a Paper - But - beging your Pardon - I must put my Spectacles on - Let me see - and here's a Gown and Coat Sept. 7. laid for 40 s: Sept 13, a Cap for 5 s. Octob. 8. a black silk-Hood and a Body of a Shift for 4 s. Octob. 12 a Velvet Cap for 6 s. Octob. 19. a Pair of Ruffles for 5 s. - that's the last - the last? No, hold - here's some in November - but that's nothing -.
Mrs. Allen. That Gown and Coat she said she was robb'd of: tho' she had pawn'd it in September, and we were not robb'd till the 27th of October.
Thursby. 'Tis not the same, for the Gown and Coat that I lost were of another Colour. My Mistress knows that I told her another Colour; and as I told her, so it was put in the Advertisement, and here the Advertisement is to prove it.

Mrs. Allen. It was a drest Suit, and she told me that she had but one drest Suit.


                  Sarah 
                  Cox 
               



            . On the 20th of November, Thursby came to me much better drest than I had seen her lately. She brought these Men's Shoes and Stockings and desired to get her a Suit of Men's Apparel, and procure her a Passage to Jamaica with some Captain that would take her as his Boy. She seem'd to be under a great Concern; but being so well drest I said to her, Mrs. Collet, (for that was her first Husband's Name) the Times are well mended. She answered, But indifferent. Are ye out of Service says I. Aye says she, I have left my Master these three Weeks, tho' it seems she had then been come away but one Day; And she told me that Captain Towers had given her a Suit of Cloaths, and a Fan and five Guineas.


                  Henry 
                  Tomlin 
               



            . Thursby came to me on the 25th of August in a Brocade Suit with red Flowers. Court. Are ye sure it was in August. H. T. Yes. Court. Were those the Clothes that were pawned? H. T. Yes - I am glad to see you so tight says I. And so, says she, 
               
                  Christian 
                  Brown 
               



             our Cook let three Men into our House and kept them five Hours in the Dust-hole, and then they came up Stairs in Disguise, and one of them had a long Knife, and I lay with my Hand upon my Eyes pretending to be asleep for fear they should kill me, and they took this Brocaded Suit out of my Trunk.
Court. How is this possible? Could she tell you on the 25th of August, that she was robb'd on the 27th of October following?
H. T. No, this was not all at the same time. She came to me in that Suit on the 25th of August, and she came again in October, and it was then that she told me the Rogues had robb'd her of the Suit she had on the last time she saw me.
Mrs. Tomlin deposed to the same Effect.
Thursby. My Master and Mistress tamper'd with these People to make it up with me; but I would not agree to it.


                  Martin 
                  Johnson 
               



            . Mrs. Allen was at my House several times, and endeavour'd to persuade me to go to the Prisoner Thursby, and tell her that I could swear, that I knew the Clothes that were at pawn were the same as she said she had lost.


                  Mary 
                  Johnson 
               



            . Mrs. Allen came to me, and shew'd me a Piece of Silk, and said, Go to your Sister, and swear, that you can swear this to be a Piece of the Clothes that she lost.
Then ten or twelve Witnesses appear'd to the Prisoner's Reputation. They deposed that she was about 21 Years of Age, and they had known her some seven or eight, some fifteen, some twenty Years, and that she bore a very good Character.
The Jury acquitted 

               Brown
            , and found Thursby 


               guilty to the value of 39 s
            .

            . About Eleven at Night I met 
               
                  Jenny 
                  Anslow 
               



            ; Sir, says she, It's very cold, will you give me a Dram? Aye, says I, Will you go to a Brandy shop? No, says she, We can't have an Opportunity at a Brandy-shop, but at my Lodging in Old-Bedlam


 we may. So I went with her, and when we came to the Door, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Thomas 
               



            , her Landlady let us in, and we went up Stairs. I gave her Landlady 6 d. to fetch a Dram, and then Jenny and I sat down together, and she making very free with my Breeches, got my Watch away before I was aware: But as soon as I mist it, I charged her with picking my Pocket; upon which, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Thomas 
               



             and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Low 
               



             came in and rescued her, and so they all ran out of the House. The Watch-man coming his Rounds, I called him in, and told him my case, and he called a Constable; we searched two or three Houses in the Neighbourhood, and at last we met with 'em all three; and the Constable found my Watch under Jenny Anslow's Arm-Pit.
The Constable confirmed the finding the Watch.


                  Jane 
                  Anslow 
               



            . This Man met me, and would needs go home with me, whereof when I came home, he said, he would give me a Crown to oblige him. He pull'd out half a Guinea and bid me give him Change, but I told him I could not; and then he said he'd leave me his Watch in pawn; but when I had obliged him, he wanted his Watch again without any Money; whereof I told him, I could not afford to work for nothing; especially, as I had taken so much Pains, for I wore out a Bunch of Rods before I could make any thing of him.
The Jury found Anslow 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.
             and 

               acquitted
             the other two.

, and looked upon some striped Thread Sattins and at last bought 14 Yards. I heard a Piece fall, and one of them took it up and laid it on the Counter. I observed that they were shuffling something under their Riding-hoods, and I told Mr. Young, that I suspected they had stole a Piece, upon which he presently follow'd them, and found this Piece of Sattin upon Ward - This was about noon.
Hezekiah Young. I overtook Fream first, and turned up her Cloak, but finding nothing there, I stopt Ward, and found the Sattin upon her. They were both carried to Covent-Garden Round-house: and the same Day examined before Justice Hilder, who granted a Warrant for commiting them to the Gatehouse, but in their way thither, with two Constables with them in a Coach and the Beadle behind, they were rescued, by several Men. We afterwards found the Prisoners committed to the Gate-house for a Fact of the same kind.

She said she had none of them, this was on the Tuesday following, and three Weeks afterwards a strange Man came and asked me if I had not lost such a Suit of Gray. I told him, Yes. And then he told me, The Cloaths are pawn'd for a Guinea, and you must give me a Guinea before you see them or the House where they be. I gave him the Money. Then he carried me to the House of the Prisoner Martha Daniel, and she shew'd me the Cloaths, and said she had them at eight o'Clock the same Night that I lost them; I asked her why she did not let me have them when I first enquired for them and offer'd her the Money. She said she was afraid that when I had got the Cloaths, I would not be so good as my Word - I found that the Stranger was her Daughter's Husband.

Court. But had not you acquainted your Mistress with it in all that time?
Pattison. No.
Pippin. She has sworn falsly, for she was in the Shop when I went to enquire for the Goods. I asked her if she had not taken in such Things, and she said she did not know, but she would ask her Mistress. And so she called her Mistress into the Shop. Do you know, says her Mistress, in whose Name the Things were pledged. No, says I, for to tell you the Truth they were stolen.
M. Pattison. My Mistress afterwards order'd me to stop Wardlow the next time he came, and so I did when he came to pawn a Black Suit.

               guilty

Then Bentley went to the Money Box and took out 3 s. 6 d. I stood at the Door all the while to watch, and then we went away to our Lodging at - Bedfords, in Well's Yard by St. Giles's Pound.

It appear'd that a large Quantity of Logwood belonging to Mess. Sidebotham and Wright, was lost out of the Ware House of Mr. Farmer. That the Prisoner Joyner, who was a Ballast-man
, lodged at the Prisoner Stedman's House, the Hand in Hand at Bow Creek. That a remarkable Boat (both ends being alike) loaded with Logwood was seen at Stedman's Back Door on the sixteenth of March. That Joyner own'd he put the Logwood into the Boat: And that Joyner's Mate (
               
                  Richard 
                  Bogue 
               



            ) had carried the Boat into Bow Creek






. That three Cart Loads of Logwood were carried from Stedman's (by order of Joyner and Bogue) to the Prisoner Bedford's House, at the Grey-hound against White Chappel Church






 on the seventeenth of March, besides one Load from the bottom of Old Gravel Lane, and one Load from the Hermitage. And that two Hundred Weight of Logwood was afterwards found, part in Stedman's Brew-house, and Part in his Stable.
But there not being sufficient Proof that this Logwood was the same that was lost, or that Joyner stole it, the Jury 

               acquitted
             the Prisoners.

             I live at Lime Kiln Dock






. My Warehouse and Dwelling House are Contigous; they are not both under one Roof, but the Roofs join, and there is a Door goes out of my Dwelling House into the Warehouse, in which I had a considerable Parcel of Logwood belonging to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Sidebotham

                  Wright 
               



            . Between one and two on Sunday Morning, the twenty seventh of April, the Watch called me up, and said, my House was broke open. I went into my Yard, and saw a Man standing there, but as soon as he perceiv'd the Light of the Lanthorn, he stept into a Ballast Lighter that was moor'd under the Crane. I found fifty two Sticks of Logwood lying in the Yard close to the Water Side. The two Prisoners were both found in the Lighter, and pretended they were driven thither by Stress of Weather, tho' there was no Wind stiring. They had left their Key in the Warehouse Door. Before the Justice they denied that they were in the Yard; yet Joyner own'd that Key, and they both confest that they moor'd the Lighter there.


                  Daniel 
                  Lewis 
               



            . About one in the Morning, it being just High Water, my Boat got a Shore by this Gentleman's Yard, and had like to have been over set. I saw this Ballast Lighter coming up with two Men in her, and suspected they had no good Design, and so I lay down in my Boat to watch them. Presently they moor'd the Lighter under the Crane and both came ashore, and whispered. Then they went towards the Warehouse, and I heard the Door open. I saw them bring out Logwood, and lay it by the Water Side. I believe they went seven or eight times in the same manner. It was a Moon-light Night, and tho' I could not then distinguish their Faces because I was on the other Side of the Dock, yet I can swear that the Men that came out of the Lighter, were the same Men that opened the Warehouse Door, and brought out the Woods, for I could see very plainly that there was no other Person in the Yard; and they and no others were taken in the Lighter. I went and call'd the Watch, and then the Prisoners jump'd off the Wharf into the Lighter, where they were both taken.
Easton. Was there no other Lighter?
Lewis. Yes; there was a Chalk Lighter.


                  John 
                  Jones 
               



            . I was just come from Eriff, and went to the Watch House, when Lewis came and told us the Ware House was broke open. We went in my Boat, and I heard the Logwood rattle; but as soon as the Light came, I saw the Prisoners jump off the Wharf into the Lighter. Joyner crept under the Foresail, and Easton laid down on the Windless, both pretending to be asleep. I pulled the Foresail off Joyner, and he asked hastily what's the matter? what's the matter? - When they were before the Justice, Joyner own'd that the Key which was found in the Ware House Door, was the Key as locked his Oars.
Joyner. We had no Oars at that time.
Jones. May be so - But you said so for all that.
J. Swainson. There were fifty two Pieces of Logwood, and one piece of Redwood, taken out of the Ware House, and left at the Edge of the Wharf. The Logwood weigh'd fifteen Hundred, one Quarter, and twenty one Pound, and was worth ten Shillings a Hundred.

            , deposed, that Easton was a hard working Man, and they knew no ill of him: But they added, they could say nothing in favour of Joyner.
The Jury found them both 


               Guilty of Felony only
            .

David Forrester. The first Night of June 1 was a lattle fuddled, and coming fra' Charing-Crose I mat this Woman and anither near the Saven Dials. They got me intull a Hoose, it was a Tavern 
               
                  Brandy 
                  Shop 
               



            , and got mare Liquor tull me, and gard me mare fuddled than before. They wanted Money o' me, but I tald 'em I had none, and I said, There's my Sward, what wad ye ha' mare? Tack ye that for a Pledge, but dunna ye tack it out of the Room, and I'll send for some Money in the Moarning. Then I ged to bed wi'the Prasoner and the ither Woman. Next Moarning, Su Murphey, who lodges in the same Hoose, came and tald me that this twa Woman were rin away wi my Goods. Sa I gade to Justice Mitford who committed Murphey tull Prison, and granted me a Warant for apprehending the Prasoner, and in twa or three Days she was sent tull the Round-Hoose. The Constable and I gade tull her and found my Stockings upon her Legs. I wad a' taken 'em off, but she said if I did she wad sware a Robery upon me, and sa she tack 'em off her sell.
Prisoner Was I in your Company any farther than to drink with you and 
               
                  Susan 
                  Minion 
               



            , or otherwise alias Day?
D. Forrester. I lay with them both.
Prisoner. But I say you had no Carnal Copulation with me - You told Su Minion, or otherwise alias Day, that you was just come out of the Country, and had no Money, and was loth to disturb your Friends, and she said you should lye in her Bed, and so you gave her the Sword for -


                  Edward 
                  Hayes 
               



            , Chairman. Between five and six that Morning as I was in a 
               
                  Brandy 
                  Shop 
               



             in St. Martin's Court in the Strand, the Prisoner and 
               
                  Sue 
                  Day 
               



             said they'd take a Dram with me at my House. With all my Heart, says I, and so I goes and knocks my Wife up. But she having no Liquor. I fetch'd a Quart, and then went to Bed and slept 'till she waked me, and said, that they having no Money to pay the Reckoning, she had pawn'd a Laced Waistcoat for the Prisoner, but was afraid it was stole, because they two had been a quarrelling, and charged one another with the Robbery. So I abused my Wife -
Prisoner. Your Wife? Ye Rascal! What is Mrs Wileman your Wife? She hanged a Man two Sessions ago - Every body knows Moll Wileman.


                  E 
                  Hays 
               



            . And what made me suspect the Prisoner the more, was, that she had got a Silver Hilted Sword with a Blue Belt, and she pull'd up her Coats and buckled it on next to her Smock - So after she was gone I went in pursuit of her, and finding her in a Night Cellar at Charing Cross, I desired her to fetch the Waistcoat out of pawn, for it being pawn'd in my Name I might come into a scrape about it. But instead of that she abused me. Then I left her and met 
               
                  Tom 
                  Day 
               



             - 
               
                  Sue 
                  Minion 
               



             goes for Tom's Wife - and Tom carried me to the Constable, who said the Gentleman would be easy and give no body any trouble if he could have his Things again. I goes to the Prisoner again, and asks her if she had made away with the Sword; she said, No. Then she came up Stairs and took Coach to Cabbage Lane - I dogged her, and saw her housed. I went back to the Constable, and he and I fetch'd the Waist-coat out of pawn, and then we went and took the Prisoner - but she had disposed of the Sword.


                  Mary 
                  Hays 
               



             alias Wileman. After my Husband went to bed, the Prisoner and 
               
                  Sue 
                  Day 
               



             drank twelve or eighteen Penn'orth of Surfeit Water. The Prisoner shew'd me this Laced Waistcoat, and desired me to pawn it, which I did, in Hemmings's Row for thirteen Shillings, and gave the Money to her.
Prisoner. You lye Mrs. Wileman! You gave it to Sue Day who is one of your own Creatures.


                  Mary 
                  Hays 
               



            . Then the Prisoner sent me for a Pot of Beer, and when I returned they two were a bitching one another; and says Sue Day, This Bitch and I have both been a-bed with a Man, and brought away his Waistcoat, and Sword, and Stockings. Well, says the Prisoner And I wish I had brought away his Coat and Breeches too. They were going to fight, and I awaked my Husband, who went for a Constable, but before he came back they were both gone.
Prisoner. The Prosecutor wanted me to go to bed with him, but I said, No, not to the finest Man upon Earth. Then he gave his Sword to Sue Day to let him lie with her - Next Morning she told me he had made her a present of his Waistcoat as well as his Sword - The Stockings were in the Waistcoat Pocket, and them she gave me. We went to Wileman's, where we got drunk and quarrelled, and thereupon she went into York Buildings, and fetch'd 
               
                  Tom 
                  Day 
               



            , and he charged me with the Robbery, but said, if I'd give him a Guinea, he would make it up with the Gentleman; because I refus'd it, this has followed. 
               
                  Sue 
                  Murphey 
               



            , who is a Prisoner below, will prove that he gave the Sword to Day.
Susan Murphey. When the Prosecutor came, he said, he had no Money, but would send a Porter for some if they would oblige him. They asked him for a Pledge, he said he had often been tricked that way but was grown wiser. At last he said he would give his Sword to Sue Day, but that she should lay it in the Chair, and not carry it out of the Room  So he put it into her Hand, not, I believe as a Present, but as a Pledge. He asked me to pawn it to my Landlady, who is a Pawn-broker, though she keeps a Brandy-shop.
Prisoner. You are a vile notorious Woman Susan.
The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 4s. 10 d
            . - As soon as she heard the Verdict, she said, my Curse and God's Curse go along with ye! and the Prayers of my Children fall upon ye.

, August 14


.
Mr. Manning. As I was going into Long-Acre




 between eleven and twelve in the Morning on the fourteenth of August, which was the Day the Fire happened there; I found a great Croud of People, and before I came to the Vine Tavern I was hussel'd about and beset by several Persons. My right Arm was held up so that I could not get it down. The Prisoner was close behind me with his left Hand on my Shoulder pushing me along. I felt my Watch pulled out of my Fobb, for my Breeches were prodigious tight. At the same time I saw the Prisoner's right Hand in between the Skirts of my Coat, but before I could get my Arm down he had got his Hand out and turned it behind him. In that posture I seized his Hand, G - D - ye, says I, You have got my Watch. I your Watch? says he, You are a Scoundrel, I have none of your Watch. Then says I, You have handed it to some of your Companions. Sir, says he, I am a Man of as good a Character as your self - but do not raise a Mob, and I will go with ye to the Tavern. So we went into the Tavern Kitchen, and there he readily pulled off his Coat, and I searched him, but to no purpose, upon which, he began to taunt, and threatned to make me suffer for scandalizing him.
Prisoner. By the vertue of your Oath, Did you see me hand the Watch, or so much as speak to any body?
Prosecutor. No.
Prisoner. Or was any body near me?
Prosecutor. Near ye, Yes, prodigiously crouded - I had my Watch just as I turned the Corner of Long Acre, and my Coat was then open, but seeing the Croud, I buttoned my Coat on purpose; notwithstanding which, my Watch was lost before I came to the Vine.


                  John 
                  May 
               



            . I saw the Prisoner with one Hand on the Prosecutor's Shoulder, and the other Hand under the Flap of his Coat. I heard the Prosecutor say, D - ye, I have lost my Watch; upon which I said, That Man (the Prisoner ) has got it.
Prisoner. Why did not you seize me then?
J. May. So I did.


                  Samuel 
                  Holditch 
               



            . I was sitting on a Chest of Drawers that was brought out from the Fire. The Prisoner with his left Hand on the Prosecutor's Shoulder pushed him up to me; D - ye, says I, Do not squeeze my Legs ye B - ; presently I saw the Prisoner's Hand under the Prosecutor's Coat while two or three Men were pushing behind. I whipt off to seize the Prisoner but could not get at him for the Croud.
Prisoner. I was going with Capt. Brown (who is now at Sea) to go to the Kentish Town Races when the Prosecutor seized me in the Croud - I have some Witnesses to my Character.


                  John 
                  Huff 
               



            , Apothecary in New Bond-street. The Prisoner lived as Journey-man
 to me about two Months, nine Months ago he was recommended to me for an honest Man, and behaved pretty well - He told me that he served his time to his Uncle who was a Surgeon in the Army - Indeed since he has been gone from me I have heard but an indifferent Character of him, his Name having been in the publick Papers.
Prisoner. After I left Mr. Huff I went into Scotland.
Mr. Eustace. I knew him several Years ago - His Family were very credible People in Dublin - But for the nine Months last past I can say nothing.


                  John 
                  Williams 
               



             I live at an Alehouse in Neal's Yard by the Seven Dials, the Prisoner used our House for about three Months, and I never saw any hurt by him.
Court. May be so - And did not Maccray come with him sometimes?
J. Williams. No; The Prisoner always came alone, I never saw Maccray.
Court. Have you no body to give an account of your Behaviour for the last nine Months? Where is your Landlord Mabson, who kept the Brandy-shop in Cow-lane, where you lodged on the fourth of June last, when you were such a notable Surgeon for Maccray? *
* Maccray was convicted at last Kingston Assizes for robbing Mr. Hammerton on the fourth of June. Gaffney was one of Maccray's Witnesses, and swore that Maccray was very ill, and that he attended him, and gave him a Vomit at the time the Robbery was committed.
Prisoner. He is not in Town.
The Jury 

               acquitted
             him.
He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing two Silver Tankards value twenty eight Pound, the Goods of

               receiving the same knowing them to have been stolen
            , July 5


.
The Witnesses were examined apart.
Mr. Shirley. I keep the Hoop Tavern against Beaufort Buildings in the Strand






. On Sunday the twenty ninth of June at about a Quarter before ten at Night, my House being very full of Company, two young Gentlemen came up my Passage and went into a Ground Room in the Yard, and rung the Bell. I went my self with a Candle. One of them turned his Face aside under presence of wiping it, and then laid his Head down on the Table, which gave me some Suspicion. The other called for half a Pint of Red, which being carried in they bid the Drawer send for a Coach - Do they take this for a Coffee-house, says I, Do they think it is worth my while to keep Servants to run on their Errands - Let them walk - In two Minutes my Drawer 
               
                  Giles 
                  Wilton 
               



             came with a Pint of Lisbon for a Cool Tankard I bid him take care of the Tankard for I did not like my Customers. He said he'd warrant the Tankard should be safe and so he carried it in. They afterwards ordered twelve Pennyworth of Beef Steaks, some of which were set by the Fire to keep warm for another Person, whom as they pretended they waited for. They bid 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Fisher 
               



             another of my Servants bring them a Tankard of Oat Ale, and thereupon he carried in another Tankard. They sent my Porter on three Errands, and while he was gone the last time they made off with both the Tankards - A little before this, I saw one of them looking out - The large Tankard weighed sixty nine Ounces twelve Penny-weight, the other cost me Ten Pound.
Gaffney. By the vertue of your. Oath am I one of the Men?
Mr. Shirley. I cannot swear to either of them.


                  John 
                  Ratcliff 
               



            . On Sunday Night the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June, between nine and ten o'Clock the Prisoner and I went to the Hoop Tavern. The Room we went into was a Ground Floor on the Right-hand going up the Court. He called for half a Pint of Wine as soon as we came in, and afterwards for a Pint with Lemon and Sugar for a Cool Tankard, which were brought with a large Silver Tankard. He spoke for something to eat, and some Steaks being brought, he ordered a Tankard of Oat Ale, and that was brought too. He sent the Porter to some House in Cheapside to enquire for some Man, but I do not know what name - When the Porter returned, he sent him again to the Bull Head at Temple Bar, and when he came back from thence he bid him go to 
               
                  Tom 
                  King 
               



            's, and while he was gone the Prisoner went out to see if the way was clear, and finding it was, he took one Tankard and I the other and so we both went away. The Room we were in, is before we come to the Bar. Three Weeks ago I made my Information before Justice Deveil.
Gaffney. This Man was catched in a Capital Offence - He was taken up for a stolen Mare, and he swears this to save his own Life.
Mr. Deveil. Ratcliff was indeed taken on suspicion of stealing a Mare -
Court. How did you dispose of the Tankards?
Ratcliff. Next Day about three in the Afternoon I sent 
               
                  Frances 
                  Charnock 
               



             with the least Tankard to the Prisoner Barthelemi a Goldsmith
 at Charing-cross




. She staid till the Evening, and when she returned she said she had sold it to him for six Pound.
Court. How came you to send her thither?
Ratcliff. Because I knew Persons who had sold him Goods which he bought without asking Questions. I went my self once with 
               
                  John 
                  Delany 
               



            , and carried a Tankard we had stolen from the Boar's Head. The other Tankard was melted down in three or four Lumps in Gaffney's Room while he was present, and three or four Days afterwards I carried it my self to Barthelemi; he weighed it, and gave me nine Guineas, but I said it came to nineteen Shillings more. He reckoned it at four Shillings and nine Pence or four Shillings and ten Pence an Ounce, I cannot say which.
Court. Did he ask ye no Questions?
Ratcliff. He asked me if I dealt in the Country, and I answered, Yes, I deal in small Wares. I sent Charnock next Day for the nineteen Shillings, and he gave it her.
Barthelemi. I bought the first Tankard for the full worth - As to what he brought I do not know what it had been, for it was melted down, and it weighed but forty three Ounces: And he being well drest, and telling me that he dealt in the Country, I had no suspicion of him.
Mr. Deveil. When I had examined Ratcliff and Charnock. I sent a Warrant for the Prisoner Barthelemi. When he came I read Ratcliff's whole Information to him, and he absolutely denied that he knew any thing of the matter; but when I brought out Ratcliff and Charnock to confront him, he owned that he bought the Tankards, and said he gave ten Pound seven Shillings for one of them.
Mr. Shirly. As one of the Tankards was whole, I desired him to return it, but he told me it was gone to the Refiners - And when Justice Deveil prest him to produce it, he said he had sold it. It was marked IER for I bought that and other Plate of the Widow Emery, who kept the Cardigan's Head. He had frequented that House, and had often seen the Tankard there, and afterwards knew that I bought it: Besides, I advertised it, with a Description of the Mark and the Weight which was set at the bottom, and one of these Advertisements was left at his House (as will be proved by the Man who left it) but a few Hours before he bought it.


                  Frances 
                  Charnock 
               



            . Gaffney, and Ratcliff and I, all lodged in the same House. They came home together on Sunday Night, the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June, and brought two Silver Tankards which they said me they had got from the Hoop Tavern. Next Day about three in the Afternoon, I went to Barthelemi's House with the small Tankard. He was not at home, but his Wife desired me to stay, which I did. And soon after he came in, he lighted Candles, and shut up the Shop. He asked me no Questions how I came by it, but I told him without asking, that I came from Mr. Ratcliff. Then he weighed the Tankard in a Room behind the Shop, and cast it up on a Piece of Paper, and told me how many Ounces it weighed, and how much it was an Ounce, but I have forgot both, only I remember he said it came to six Pound three Shillings, or wanting three Shillings, I do not know which. Then he asked me where I lived, I told him in Holborn - I then lived in Gray's Inn-lane - He said he was going that way to meet some Company, and he would see me so far homeward. So he went with me to the upper end of St. Martin's Lane in Long Acre, and would have gone farther but I refused, and so we parted, and I carried the Money to Ratcliff, who gave half of it to Gaffney.
Barthelemi. Did not I ask you how you came by it?
Charnock. No, not a Word.
Barthelemi. Did not you pass for the Wife of one Johnson, and bring a Note?
Charnock. No.
Barthelemi. You did, and you said your Husband had had a Suit of Law in the Country, and on that account you was forced to sell the Tankard - What Letters was it marked with?
Charnock. I do not know.
Barthelemi. It was not on Monday that you brought it, but on Thursday.
Court. Produce your Books and contradict her if you can, by shewing a regular Entry.
Barthelemi. I keep no Books - I cannot write -
[As this was hardly spoke loud enough for the Court to hear him distinctly, he dropt this Pretence and said] - I set it down so in my Book, and that I gave her six Pound nineteen Shillings.
Mr. Deveil. After I had brought him to own that he bought the Tankards, he took me aside into another Room, and told me this matter might prove very troublesome to him, but it was in my power to make it more agreeable, and if I would go to his Shop he would make it easy to me, or Words to that effect: When I came back with him into the other Room, I asked him before twenty or thirty People, if he was not ashamed to offer to bribe me? He answered, that what he intended to give me - was only his Prayers.
Mr. Shirley. He sent for me into the same Room, and offered me twenty, twenty five, and then thirty Guineas if I would be easy - Will your Lordship please to ask Charnock about her selling him a Silver Pint Mug that was stolen from the Crown Tavern by GuildHall.
Court. No, I cannot enquire into particular Facts for which he is not indicted.
Barthelemi. I gave her five Shillings an Ounce for a Silver Mug.
Court. Why will you needs take this upon your self?

             I am a Messenger to the Goldsmith's Company. On Monday, June 30. between three and four in the Afternoon, I left a Printed Advertisement of the same Tenour as this in my Hand at Barthelemi's Shop, and I think I gave it to his Wife. It contains a Description of the two Tankards, the Marks, Weight, and Size.
Then he read the Advertisement in Court.
Gaffney to Charnock. Did not you live with Ratcliff as his Wife, and go by his Name?
Charnock. Yes, I did.
Gaffney. How many were concerned in stealing the Tankards?
Mr. Shirley. Two.
Gaffney. The unfortunate Dr. Dunn was tried here last Sessions for stealing these Tankards; and did not you and your Servants swear positively that he was one of the two Men?
Shirley. I never did, nor do I swear to you.
Gaffney. It would be but Justice to bring your Servants here, to see if any of them know me.
Shirley. I did send two of them to the Gate-house, and they said they did not know the Prisoner.
Gaffney. Very Good!
Barthelemi. I have Witness to prove that I gave to the Value of the Plate.
Mr. Mansfield, Goldsmith. The usual Price of Old Sterling Tankards when melted. is five Shillings, or five Shillings one Penny an Ounce, for there is a vast deal of Sodder in it.
Mr. Shirley. The Tankards were both New Sterling.
Mr. Mansfield. Then they were worth three Pence an Ounce more.

            , Silversmith. I offered to sell Mr. Barthelemi a Tankard at a Crown an Ounce, but it was Old Sterling.
Mr. Pattison, a Turner. I live opposite to Barthelemi; he works hard in his Shop from Morning to Night - I have seen him buy Goods publickly, and never thought that he would buy any thing in a private clandestine way; for I took him to be as honest a Man as lived.
Court. Have you never heard of his absconding on some account?
Pattison. I have heard that an Action at Common Law was brought against him for a Watch; and that thereupon he went abroad because he had not Money to pay for the Watch and Charges.
Barthelemi I stopt a Maid for offering to sell me a Tea-pot, till she sent for her Mistress.
German Bonette. I was not present when the Maid came by her self, but I saw the Maid and her Mistress together in his Shop; and he told me that he had obliged the Maid to send for her Mistress.
Several others deposed that they believed him to be a fair Dealer, and that he would not knowingly buy Plate that he suspected to be stolen.
The Jury found them both 

               Guilty
            . Gaffney received Sentence of 


               Death

. My House was broke open May 23, between twelve and one in the Morning. The Entrance was made at my Window, from whence they came through the Celler, broke open a Cupboard, and took the three Tankards, which weighed about eighty Ounces.

                  Davenport 
               



            . The Prisoner Lewis and I, committed this Fact. He pulled up one of the Bars with his Hand, and with that Bar he wrenched up the others; and then I standing to watch, he went in and brought out the Tankards. We went with them first to Mrs. Pritchard's at the Brill, but it being so soon in the Morning, she would not let us in, and so we carried them to Mrs. Morris, in Eagle Court in the Strand, and knocked her up about two in the Morning. Her Husband let us in. At first she seem'd scrupulous of dealing with us, for she said she had been in trouble on the like Account. * Lewis had been recommended to her, but she said she did not know that I went abroad (that is a Thieving.) though she knew something of me when I was Apprentice to a Glass Blower in the Strand. We told her she need fear no harm from us, for no body was concerned in it but our selves. About eight the same (Saturday) Morning, her Son fetched some Charcoal to melt the Plate. We melted it below Stairs while she was above, and then we carried it up to her. She weighed it with old Leaden Weights, and said there was forty six Ounces in all, and reckoning it at four Shillings an Ounce it came to nine Pound odd. She gave us five Guineas then, and the Remainder on the Thursday following - I made my Information seven or eight Weeks ago before Justice Deveil.
* She was tried in April, 1733. but acquitted. She was an Evidence for

            ) for apprehending Lewis. In the Morning when she came to go with me, she bid me take help enough, for he was very desperate. We went to his Lodging next to the Black Jack in Dyot Street about seven in the Morning, and the Door being ajar, we entered and seized him abed. In the Room we found all these things, two Hangers, a Pick-lock-key, a Dark Lanthorn, Pistols, Powder and Bullets.
Davenport. This Pick-lock-key we bought of Morris's Son.

On the nineteenth of August, the Prisoner came to our Shop, and said, he had a little piece of Plate to dispose of, and then he produced this Escallop'd Silver Salver. Seeing a Crest on it, I asked him whose it was. He said he did not know, for it was left him by his first Wife. I told him I must stop the Plate till he could satisfy me how he came by it. He asked me what I meant by that, and said, he could soon fetch one that knew him; and so he went and fetched Mr. Stafford from the Stamp Office. Mr. Stafford told me who the Prisoner was, and said that he believed him to be an honest Man - I looked into a Book of Arms, and thought the Crest was like the Duke of Chandos's. But on my going thither, I was told it was Sir Robert Walpole's. I went to Sir Robert's, and there the Plate was owned.

            . My Master Bullock of Colebrook keeps a Warehouse
 here in Town which I look after. He employs forty or fifty Servants, and when he wants a Hand he sends to me - I sent the Prisoner to him about three Months ago. On the twenty ninth of July, 1 heard that a Man was stopt with some of my Master's Goods. I went and found the Prisoner, and these Skins, which I believe to be my Master's. I asked him how he came by them; he said he found them, and as he was coming to bring them to me he was stopt; but though he found them, he would pay me for them if I would give him no farther trouble - They had not the King's Stamp on them.

            . On Tuesday, July 29, between four and five in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came to my House with two Bundles, and called for a Pint of Beer. He desired me to let him leave those Bundles. I put them behind the Bar. Then he said, he wished I could let him lye there if it was but for one Night, for he wanted a Lodging, and there were so many wicked Houses about Town, that a sober Man could hardly find a Place to lay his Head in - At Night my Maid lighted him up Stairs, and when she came down she said she wondered I would let that strange Man lay there, for though he pretended so much Godliness, he had been very rude to her, and forced his Hand up her Coars. Upon this, we examined his Bundles, and found they were wet Skins, and suspecting he did not come honestly by them, we got a Constable, and made the Prisoner get up. And then he denied that ever he delivered the Skins to me.

            , Beadle. When I saw the Skins were wet, and had no Stamps on them, I sent for a Constable. The Prisoner at first refused to rise, and denied that he brought the Bundles. He told us however that he worked for Mr. Bullock, at Colebrook. Upon which, one who was present, said, that Mr. Bullock had a Ware-house in Town, and so sent for King who belongs to the Ware-house.
J. Robinson. I know these are my Master Bullock's Skins by the Marks, for each of his Men marks his own Work, that if there is any Fault we may know who to blame.
Prisoner. I would not have left my Master but for the Wickedness of his Workmen, for they were so given to drink Gin, that I who had always behaved my self with Sobriety, could not bear to see them go on in that pernicious Practice. As for the Skins, I found them on this side Colebrook, and considering with my self that they might belong to my Master, I resolved as I was going to London, that I would deliver them to his Ware-house-keeper there. And this was my Design, on my Word and Truth, and as I hope for Mercy in the Kingdom of Heaven. But for Christ's Sake! for the Lord Jesus Sake! let me have my Punishment in my own Country.

I went accordingly, and met Lawler, who told me the Mony was ready, and so took me to the Thatched House in Butcher's Lane, where I saw O Brian an Attorney sitting by the Fire. Presently in came Mac Cray and the Prisoner. I had never seen Mac Cray but once before, and that was by accidentally being at a House where he was drinking. He was O Brian's Clerk. As soon as he came in, he took me by the Hand, and was so mighty glad to see me that nothing could be like it. He pulled out a handful of Gold and Silver, and asked me if I wanted any Mony. I told him I only wanted a Note of sixty five Pounds to be discounted. O says he, I will do that for you in five Minutes. So he took me to the Door, and called a Coach, and he and I and the Prisoner went in, and Mac Cray bid the Coachman drive to Mr. Heath's, a Tavern in Spring Garden. When we came there, he asked who was in the Parlor. He was answered, Mr. Heath with some Company. Then we went up Stairs, where they shewed me some Pictures to amuse me, and said, why do you keep Company with such low lifed Fellows? See what a House we bring ye to ! In a little time the Drawer came and said there was now Room in the Back Parlor. So we went in there, and they told me Heath should discount the Note. Heath came in and talked of Horse Races and went out again. We knocked, and 
               
                  Peter 
                  Senhouse 
               



             the Drawer came. I gave the Note to Mac Cray, who gave it to Senhouse. They brought Pen and Ink and bid me indorse it, which I did. Mac Cray asked me if any body thereabouts knew the Hands of the other Indorsers. I said, yes, a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood. Mac Cray took the Note, and said he would go and enquire. He went out, and coming back he told the Prisoner that the Gentleman's Footmen were sawcy Fellows. Upon which the Prisoner pretended to be in a violent Passion, snatched the Note out of my Hand in a hurry, and said, D - the insolent Rascals! I will have them turned out of their Places. And then he went out, and returning to me he said the Note was very good and I should have my Mony in two or three Days. I insisted upon having my Note again, but the Prisoner went away. Mac Cray turned me out at the Back Door, and carried me to the George Tavern in Spring Gardens, and from thence he took me in a Coach a second time to

            's, at the Hare and Hound in Peter Street, and from thence to Mr. Mac Kelly's at the King's Arms Tavern in Wild Street.
Prisoner. It's surprising you should go to all these Places, and not complain to any of the Company where you went.
Boyle. I knew not what to do, nor how to get my Note again, and then I had been drinking. We had Punch at Heath's, where Mac Cray filled me brimming Glasses, and swore by G - I should drink them off. And at the George Tavern we had a Pint of Wine. So that I was drunk when I came the second time to the Hound and Hare. And besides, Mac Cray all along amused me with one pretence or other, and told me if I would but be easy and meet him the next Morning, I should certainly have the Mony. But instead of that, I have been sued for this Note; I have had thirty seven Actions brought against me on account of this Note, and another which was forged for forty eight Pound. It has cost me above two hundred Pound, and has been the ruin of me.

            . On the twenty eighth of November last, between nine and ten at Night, the Prosecutor and Mac Cray came to my House by Clare Market in a Coach. The Prosecutor was drunk, and Mac Cray would have some Punch. I refused to let him, but he would have an eighteen-penny Tiff, and so at last I made it. When that was out he would have had another, but I was resolved to make no more. They staid about two Hours, and at going away, I advised Mac Cray to take care of his Friend the Prosecutor, and see him safe Home. No, says Mac Cray, I will make a hundred Pounds of him before to-morrow Morning.
Mr. Kelly. Between eleven and twelve at Night, the Prosecutor and Mac Cray knocked at my Door, the King's Arms in Wild Street, and wanted a Bottle of Wine. I told the Prosecutor he was drunk and had better go home. However, they came in, and then I went to Bed - I think Mac Cray was not drunk.
Mr. Kelly's Drawer. They had a Bottle of Wine, and then called for the Reckoning; the Prosecutor put his Hand in his Pocket, and said, By G - I have no Money, and then Mac Cray gave a six and thirty Shilling Piece to change.
Mr. Clendon. I have heard the Prisoner say that he never had but twenty Pound for the Note, and that was from one Wreathock an Attorney in Hatton Garden.

            , I keep the Wine Cellar
 under the Chappel in Spring Gardens, but I live in a House next Door. Gray (Mac Cray) brought Boyle to me to have a Note discounted, but I could not do it, and so Boyle had his Note again.
Prisoner. Was not Boyle at your House the next Day?
Boyle. Yes, I was there, and they made me pay Four Shillings for my Dinner, though I was so vext that I could hardly eat any thing. I saw the Prisoner there, and I asked him for my Note or the Money, but he said Mac Cray had got the Note. I staid there till the Evening, and then Mr. Heath told us that Mac Cray and the Prisoner were two notorious Rogues, and vile Villains.
Heath. I did not say vile Villains, for I do not love Law Suits; but being told that the Note was not taken away, but that it was given to be discounted, I thereupon said, they were got into bad Hands - Meaning Mac Cray and the Prisoner?
Heath. No, meaning only Mac Cray, for Boyle said that 
               
                  Tom 
                  Gray 
               



             (Mac Cray) had got the Note.
Boyle. I said no such thing.

                  Bowyer 
               



            . I went to Mr. Heath's about eleven in the Morning, and there I saw Boyle, and afterwards the Prisoner came down, and Boyle told him that he waited for Mac Cray to whom he had given a Note the last Night. But he did not say a Syllable of the Prisoner's having the Note.
Boyle. I am positive that this Man was not there, for there was no such Person in the Company, and I never saw this Man before Yesterday.
Heath. Bowyer was there, and drank with Boyle, and they afterwards dined together with other Company.
Heath and Bower were put out of Court - Now Boyle, what had you for Dinner that Day?
Boyle. A Leg of Mutton boil'd, but it was half raw, and when the out-side was cut off, we broil'd some of the rest.
How many might there be in Company?
Boyle. Five or six. It was but a little Room, and they pretty well filled it. I scolded and made a Noise about my Note, and there was one Bradshaw a lusty Man, who said if I would give them an eighteen-penny Tiff of Punch, they would help me to my Note again - The Prisoner came in about two of the Clock, and I insisted upon his giving me the Note, but he said Mac Cray had it.
Now call in Bowyer - Here Bowyer ! What had you for Dinner that Day?
Bowyer. I cannot say what; for I dined there two or three Days in a Weeks, and this was four or five Months ago. We pay nothing for eating, but each Man pays for a Bottle of Wine.
- What Day of the Week or Month was it?
Bowyer. I cannot pretend to remember the Day, nor what Discourse happened.
- Not remember what Discourse? And yet you have been very particular as to what Boyle said.
Bowyer. I am sure of this, that he did not speak to the Prisoner.
- You swore otherwise just now.
Bowyer. But I mean he did not say a Word to him as to charging him with having the Note.
- What is the Prisoner's Character?
Bowyer. I never heard any harm of him, but that he was a Split-cause Lawyer.
- Call in Heath - Do you remember what you had for Dinner that Day?
Heath. I cannot say that I do.
- Or what Day of the Week or Month it was?
Heath. No, for I do not set down a Minute of every thing.

            . I have heard both Bowyer and Heath say, that three were not two greater Rogues living than Mac Cray and the Prisoner.
Prisoner. Pray ask him if he has not had Malice prepense against me for these three Years?
Osgood. No other than what I have had to any other Person of such a Character - I had no private personal Malice.
Prisoner. He and I have Horse-whipped one another, and I threw Water in his Face.
Osgood. Mac Cray indicted two innocent Women for a Robbery * I was concerned on their part, though what I did, was at my own Expence, I went to a House where the Prisoner and one Driscol where, to give notice for Mac Cray to attend the Tryal. The Prisoner and Driscol quarrelling, the Prisoner threw Water at him, and part of it fell on me.

I'll take Care of your Bundle the while, and give ye Three-pence now, and Three-pence when you come back. So he gave me Three-pence, and I left the Cloth on the Bulk, but when I returned he was gone.

Henry Dun. Having been taking a Bottle on Sunday Night, and being a little merry, I met the Prisoner near Charing Cross


 about twelve o'Clock, and took her up an Alley. I had stood but a little while before I found her Hand in my Pocket, upon which I felt for my Watch, and it being then safe, I staid a little longer, and then we parted; but soon after I felt again for my Watch and it was gone. I described her to the Watchmen, and they found her on the Friday Night following. She confest before the Justice that she had the Watch, and by her Direction it was found at the Pawn-brokers; she says indeed that I gave it her, but this is the common Pretence of such Creatures to make People ashamed to prosecute them; but I knew better, and I hope others will follow my Example.
Prisoner. He picked me up, and took me into the Alley, where he offered such unseemly things that it is a shame to speak of them. He said he had no Money, but if I would oblige him he would pledge his Watch with me; and as he supposed I was commonly to be found thereabouts, he would redeem it the next time he saw me.

, and there, between Ten and Eleven at Night, Sutton and Beesly knocked down a Gentleman, and took his Money, I cannot tell how much, but Sutton afterwards gave me Two Shillings for my Share of it - I lay in the Ditch ready to assist them.
Q. Where was Goodman?
Winn. He lay in the Ditch too; but I don't know that he was acquainted with their Design (for I never saw him before that Night) nor that he had any Part of the Money.
Sutton. What Places do you say we were at before and after the Robbery?
Winn. I came directly from my Mistress (Mrs. How's) House in St. Martin's Church-yard, and after the Robbery I went home again - We afterwards agreed to rob my Mistress's House.

John Watson. This Thomas Jordan keeps a Lodging House in Rag-Fair


. We went to drink together at Mr Smith's, and there I told Jordan, that I did not like my Bed. He said I should have a better, and so I went home with him again, and there I saw the Prisoner whom I had never seen before. I drank a Mug of Beer, there and then was for going to Bed. Jordan bid the Prisoner, take the Candle and make the Bed; and while she was doing that I undrest. I put my Breeches under the Pillow and got into Bed. My Money was sew'd up in my Fob. The Prisoner came pretending to take the Candle, but took hold of my Breeches. I got a grip of them. But she cryed, Let go ye Old Dog, or I'll cut your Neck, and so pulled them away from me, and run down Stairs and out of the House, tho' I got out of Bed and called to Jordan to stop her. I put on my Coat and went down to follow her, but he stood at the bottom of the stairs, and would not let me go out, for he said if I did, the Mob would kill me. He gave me a pair of his Breeches to put on. I would have-gone out the next Day but he would not let me. At last I took him up, then he found out the Woman. It was I that made her a Woman, for she was a ragged ars'd Beast before she laid hold of my Breeches.

Coming into my Room I mist my Goods, and found a Man's Hat upon the Floor. I was informed that Sarah Miller (who buys and sells in Rag Fair) had pawned such Goods as I had lost. I met with her, and she told me she had them from Belmosset, and Sears. I found some of them pawned at Mr. Martins, against White Chappel Church. Some she sold to the Prisoner Weston. The Constable went with a Warrant to search for the rest, at the three Blue Balls in Mansell Street in Goodman's Fields, but the Pawn-broker would not let him search.

             - I happened to see Belmosset just as Mr. Brain had seized him, and so I assisted to secure him. He swore D - him he had nothing of the Goods, but an old Cloak, and a Shilling. We went to Martin the Pawn-broker, and he readily shewed us what Goods he had. But Harrison refused to let us search, though we had a Warrant; and he told us, if the Justice himself was to come he should not search his House.
Belmosset was found 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

            . The Gown was sent me to alter, I have Lodgings in John King's House, I went out on Friday and when I returned I heard the Gown was lost. I enquired who had been there and was told only a Woman, who went up stairs to one that lodged above - I went to several Pawnbrokers, and among the rest to Mr. Heatons and shewed a pattern of it to his Servant, who said he could not or would not ( I forget which) tell me any thing about it. I advertised it with two Guineas Reward, and then Heaton came and gave me notice, that he had got the Gown, which he said was pawn'd for forty Shillings, but he expected two Guineas Reward. Next Day the Prisoner came to justify herself to me. I sent for Heaton and asked him if she was the Woman that pawn'd it. He said No, and then she fell upon me and abused me, and he seemed to be concerned for her. I afterwards got an Attorney to write him a Letter, that if he would not produce the Person that brought him the Gown, he should be Prosecuted, and then he said it was the Prisoner. When she was taken she offered to pay me a Crown a Week till the two Guineas were paid, if I would make it up.

When I came home I saw the Brocaded Gown on my Counter, She came again next Day, and I sent her Ten Shillings more upon it. Mrs. Cosins sent for me in the Evening, and I had taken so little notice of the Woman in the Morning, that I could not be positive to her But afterwards when she was brought to our House, she own'd herself to be the Person that took the Gown, and then I sent for Mrs. Cosins,

                  Baccett 
               



            . On the ninth of June about Ten at Night I met two Women in Fleet-street, who asked me to give 'em a glass of Wine, I thought one of them was like a Maid who had been my Servant, but had rob'd me of a pair of Silver Spurs, for which I dismist her, and so to be satisfied I went with them to the Prisoner's House in Hind-Court in Fleet-street


, where I soon found my Mistake. However, I trea ed them with a Tiff of Punch, and after that, with another, and then they went away, and then I and my Landlady (the Prisoner) had another Tiff. I had been drinking before with a Captain on board a Ship, of which I was part Owner. - And so I fell a Sleep - When I waked I asked what was to Pay. The Prisoner said I had nothing to Pay, and that was true enough - for she had left me nothing in my Pocket ( except three Pence ) as I found when I came home. So I went to her next Day, and asked her if she knew the two Women that were in my Company over Night. No, says She, but they were merry free Girls, and you gave them a Shilling a Piece, and went out with them. I told her, I mist some Gold and a Gilt Metal Watch, and an old fashion'd Tweezer Case. She said she would endeavour to help me to 'em again So we had a Tiff of Punch, and we agreed to Advertise the Watch and Tweezer-Case, to be left at her House, with a Reward of a Guinea for the Watch, and a Crown for the Tweezer-Case. I Advertis'd accordingly, and in two or three Days went to the Prisoner's House again. And she told me a Woman had been there with the Watch, but would not leave it because I had not left the Money. Why Madam, Says I you might have laid the Money down for me, when you would have had the Goods for your Security. But however, there's a Guinea for the Watch, and a Crown for the Tweezer Case. So I left the Money and came again next Day, and had another Tiff of Punch, and then she produced the Watch. But where's the Case Madam? - What Case! is not the Watch in the Case? - Aye but the Tweezer-Case, Madam - Lord Sir, I know nothing of the Tweezer-Case - Why Madam did not I leave a Guinea for the Watch and a Crown for the Tweezer-Case? I swear Sir I thought you had meant the Watch Case, for I never read the Advertisement; but D - the Bitch, I know where she lives, and she shall never sting me so, for I'll make her bring the Case. So we parted, and when I came the next time, she told me, truly the Case was Pawn'd for a Crown, and she must have a Crown to redeem it. Why Madam this is a sort of a Bite upon me, did not I give ye a Crown for the Case! - Aye, but Sir I paid that for the Watch-Case. Nay Madam if that's the Case I am as far off as ever, tho' it has cost me three times more to get this Case than ever the Case was Worth. And with that I went away and resolv'd to go no more after it, for I thought with myself I might chance this Woman to Eternity, about my Case, and all to no purpose. However, about two Months afterwards I received 100 l. at the Bank, and paid away 75 l. of it. And going home about twelve at Night with the rest of my Money in my Pocket, and seeing the Prisoner's door open and a Woman in the Window, a Whim came into my Head to call once more for this Case, And so I goes in, and there was Madam mighty glad to see me, and wondring what was become of me, and why I did not call for my Case, Well, have ye got it now? - Aye, Sir, but shall we not drink first - With all my Heart, let's have a Tiff of punch. So the Punch was brought, and then she bid her Maid fetch the Case, but the Maid told her it was too late. Upon this I gave Madam half a Guinea to Change. I can't change it says she, but shan't we have t'other Tiff. I answer'd No she replied, yes but we will, and I'll join with ye. I was not forward to join with her, but, she brought in another Tiff. I tasted it and told her it was to strong, for it was almost all Brandy. She said she loved it so, for if it was not Stiff it would give her the Cholic. Then I ask'd her for my Change, and she said she'd fetch it; but she stay'd so long that I fell asleep, and when I waked I found her leaning over my Chair with her Hand in my Pocket I ask'd her what she meant by that? She pulled her hand away with my Gold in it and said, Here is a fine parcel of Money to carry along the streets at this time of Night. Do ye think I'll let you go out of my House with so much Gold about ye? - No - if you should fall into ill Company and lose it, you'll think you have lost it here, and then I must bear the blame, and therefore I'll take Care of it till you come again. But Madam, says I, is that a Reason for Picking my Pocket? Why Dovee, says she, do you think now that I would rob you of this Money? No, it shall be as safe as if you had it at home. I'll assure you I keep as honest a House as any in London. - One Night a Gentleman went up stairs with a Girl, and left his Gold Watch upon the Bed. I found it after he was gone, and gave him it the next time he came, and so I did by another Gentleman that left his Pocket Book with a 100 l. Bank Note in it. - Madam I'll have my Money says I, before I go, D - ye but ye shan't says she, and if you stay much longer I'll have your Watch too. - But by good luck I had left my Watch at Home. I continued telling her I would not go without my Money, she threatned to fetch them that should silence me, and so she went away and I expected some Mischief for she had told me before that she kept a Soldier to assist her when People would not conform to the Rules of the House. But in a little time she came in again by herself, and said, What, han't you made an end of your Punch yet? get you out of my House? And so she dragg'd me to the Door, and tossed my Hat and Cane after me. I was so disabled with Drinking that I could not defend my self; I made shift to get Home, but being very sick I lay a Bed all that Day. The next Day I went to her House again to enquire after my Money, and then she said I had not been within her Doors that Night. - My Tweezer-Case was sent to me after she was committed to Newgate.
Mr. Parrot. The Prosecutor told me he had got the Slut in Newgate. I went to see her there; she said she was afraid this unhappy Affair with him would be the Ruin of her. That she had sent one to offer him all his Money to make it up; and had likewise sent to a Man that keeps a little Baudy-Ken, and sells Ale in an Alley in Fleet-street, to tell him that if he did not return the Tweeser Case to the Prosecutor, she should be obliged to discover all.

             The Prisoner is my Mistress. On the twenty eighth of October about twelve at Night, the Prosecutor brought a Woman into our House, and I made them two Tiffs of Punch, and when the Punch was out they went away together; he had his Hat on, and his Cane in his Hand. But all the time he was in our House, my Mistress was asleep in the Coffee-Room, and did not see him that Night, nor at any time afterwards till he came and took her up.

            , Watchman. Between one and two in the Morning, going up Hind Court, I found a Hat, and looking forward, I saw this Gentleman standing as if he was making Water. I asked him if he had lost his Hat, he said yes, and his Cane too. I found it and gave it him, and asked him where he lived. He said, in Nevil's Alley in Fetter Lane. I went home with him, and at parting he said, he did not know but he might be one thousand Pound the worse for that Night's Work.
Q. Was he drunk?
Hill. I leave the honourable Court to judge of that.
Q. What sort of a House does the Prisoner keep?
Hill. I cannot say as to that, for I watch without Doors and not within - I do not know of any Disturbances - in this way - once indeed the Constable was called, about a Trifling Affair of a Boy's losing two Guineas.
Q. What Reputation has the House?
Hill It is very hard for a poor Watchman to give a Character of a House-keeper.
Q. What do you mean by trifling with the Court?
Hill. Why she does keep a - Bawdy-house.

Thomas Grant. I had just received 3 Shirts, 4 Stocks, and two Night-caps, ty'd up in a Linnen Handkerchief, as this Man came begging to the Door. They lay at a little Distance from the Door on the Counter; I was engaged in Business with my Back to the Linnen, and the Man was advanced almost within the Door: I was busy, and not very watchful. I told the Prisoner there was nothing for him, but I was mistaken as it happen'd. He went away; about 4 or 5 Minutes afterwards, I mist it, but thought the Servants might have taken it away. Upon enquiry, I found it was gone, and imagined that this Man must take it. On the Monday following he came again, and I seized him with one of the Shirts on his Back, which he resign'd, and then asked me to forgive him.
The Prisoner own'd his taking the Goods, and said by way of Excuse, that he wanted a Shirt, therefore he took them: That he was in Liquor and had forgot the Door, else he would not have came there again, and that he gave this Shirt back to the Prosecutor with a very good Will, and in a very good natur'd Manner.

            . December 23 d

.
Richard Baker, Senr. We have a Ware-house which belongs to me and my Son; we make Lines and Twine in that Place, and these Iron Crows, we stick into the Ground to fasten our Lines to. All I have to say is, on the 23d. of last Month at Night, or the 24th. in the Morning, I know not which, we were robb'd. The Iron Crows I can swear to, the Lines I cannot, tho' I believe I might swear to them. I could have been very willing the Grand Jury should have found the Bill against the Persons where we took the Goods. We miss'd our Goods the next Morning, but could not find them, 'till some Days afterwards.


                  Charles 
                  Charnock 
               



            . I was concerned in this Robbery, Dun, Beshaw and I, went from a Brandy-shop in Winford street that Night: Says Dun, let us go round Ratcliff-high-way; the back Yards there are good Places to get wet Linnen from: We went round Ratcliff-high-way



, cross'd Sun-tavern-fields



, and came to Mr. Baker's Shed.
Q. What sort of a Place is this Shed?
Richard Baker Junr, 'Tis built as strong as the Carpenter could build it: We have abundance of Goods there, and we use it as a Ware-house, as well as a Work-house.
Charnock. We propos'd getting into Mr. Baker's Shed to look for the Iron Bolts; when we came to the Door, Beshaw took a Key out of his Pocket, and open'd the Door; this was about one o'Clock in the Morning; he went in and saw the 2 Iron Crows; then I went in, and Beshaw stood at the Shed Door: I brought the 2 Crows out to Beshaw at the Door, and Beshaw gave them to Dun, and he stood up with them in Shakesby's Walks, while Beshaw and I went back again, to see if there were any more Bolts; we found two Balls of Line in the Shed, one of Hand-Line, and the other of House-Line, and thirteen Pound and a half of Hemp, which we ty'd up together; Beshaw carried one Bottom, and I carried the other and the Hemp; we brought the Things to my Mother's in Hare street, but this Dun and Beshaw went away with the Bolts, (Iron Crows). I knocked my Mother up, and staid half an Hour with her; then I went in the back Yard, dug a Hole, and buried one Bottom of Line in the Yard; the other Bottom, in single Lines as I could spare Time.
Beshaw. Did not you call me from the Brandy-shop?
Charnock, We went out together, as we have done many a Time, to get what we could meet with.
Mr. Baker, jun. The Crow I swear to; the unfinished Lines, I cannot swear to; but we have two Men here who made them, and who will swear they are my Property. The Prisoners and Charnock were suspected, and we took them before Justice Philips. Charnock begg'd to be made an Evidence (he had worked with me some years ago) the two Prisoners owned the Fact before the Justice.

            . When we came to work on Christmas-Eve in the Morning, we found our Work gone, and the Shed robb'd: We made Holiday, and I and my two Mates went up and down to make some Discovery; we found some of the Hemp at the Bottom of Shakesby's Walks, which we put into the Ware-house again, and got a Search Warrant, to search where we suspected, but we found nothing; but going to drink a Dram with a Friend we met, we told him our Master had been robb'd; he told us he had seen such Things as we had lost at Bigg's; we went there, and found them upon a Cask-Head; there were several Skains of House-Lines in Bigg's Shop in Whitechapel: Whereof after we had found them, we desired Biggs to stop the Man that brought them if he should come again, but he said he would not; but going up Brick-Lane we met Charnock. Whom we believed to be concerned, and we agreed to have a Penn'orth of Gin together, whereof we turned up to Bigg's again, and there we desired Biggs to stop the Man that brought those Lines; he said he had no Business with it, the Man that brought them should have them. I left one of my Mates there, while I stept down to Justice Philips; and while I was there, word was brought down that the Man that brought the Lines was in Bigg's Shop; he (Charnock) was brought down, and there he told us, the Bolts we should find at Webb's, a Smith's, against Spittle-fields Church, and that some of the Lines were at his Mother's; we went, but the Hole in the Yard was dug up, and the Lines were gone; whereof we searching farther found a Ball of Line buried at their Vault-door, and the Line was my Master's; we found Part of the Hemp in the Cellar, and the best had been spun up.

The Prisoners having little to say in their Defence, the Jury found them 


               guilty to the Value of 4s. 10d
            .

I went to her House, and she shewed me the Handkerchief: I told her it was mine; she said she had it 12 Years, and I must prove it to be mine. or I should suffer for it.

Council. Did you miss it while Jordan liv'd with you?
Sparkes. Yes, and charg'd her with it.
Council. How long was it, from the time you lost it, to the time you saw it again?
Sparkes. I saw it no more, 'till the Morning I took out the Warrant for them.

'Tis my Business to visit the King's Watchmen: I was going that night over the Key, and saw the Prisoner loitering about some Hogsheads of Tobacco; I went to look at him; he ran; I cry'd, stop him; one of the Evidences stopt him, and the other saw him drop the Tobacco. I am positive to the Prisoner; and upon searching the Hogsheads, we found one broke open, and about the same Quantity taken out, that he had dropt.

Mary Pickering. The Prisoner and another young Woman came into my Shop, the 10th of February, about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and asked for a Bit of Cambrick; they had not been long in the Shop, before I perceived they wanted none. The Prisoner put her Hand down, and dropped something; I saw her stooping to take it up. I had no Body then in the Shop, but before they went away, my Mother came in: I gave her a Hint to watch them: They bought a Quarter and Nail of Cambrick, and paid for it; then they went away. I miss'd immediately the spotted Lawn, and though my Mother saw them turn down the next Court, yet we could not find them: So I went to the Pawnbrokers to desire them to stop it, if such a Thing should come to be pawn'd. The next Morning one came and asked me, if I could swear to the Woman and the Lawn: I said, if the Woman was in the same Dress, I could, and the Lawn was very remarkable, for there were several Darns in the End of it: I knew the Prisoner again, and I value the Lawn at 40 s.

Pope said it was Brass; I said it was Iron, but it proved Brass, and we sold it the Prisoner, Whitehead. She always bought what we stole; she liv'd in George-Alley, at Fleet-Ditch

- Partridge. I was at Home one Evening and Cockran came to my House, and asked me where Whitehead liv'd; if I would fetch her, he said he would satisfy me. I fetched her, and he shew'd her the Mortar: He asked her, if she could help him to dispose of it; she said she could, and went out to enquire for a Chap: She returned and said, if he would bring the Mortar, she had found one that would buy it. Whitehead and I carried it to one Mrs. Peaton's: She bought it; what she gave for it, I don't know, but Whitehead received the Money, and gave it Pope and Cockran.
Q. Did she receive it, and dispose of it as stolen Goods?
Partridge. Yes.
Q. Do you know any thing of her?
Partridge. I know no ill of her.
Q. Why, is not receiving stolen Goods, a Crime? You are on your Oath: Was she not a Receiver of stolen Goods?
Partridge. Yes. She paid Pope for this Mortar, in Black-Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane. The Prisoners had nothing material to say in their Defence.

John Baskerville. At the Queen's Head in Ratcliff Hamlet, in White-horse-street, the Prisoner and I lay together; there was 3 of us in all; I lay in the middle. The Buttons were on my Cloaths when I went to Bed, and the Buckles in my Breeches; when I waked in the Morning. the Prisoner was gone and all the Buttons cut off my Cloaths. I had laid my Cloaths on a Chair close to that side of the Bed on which he lay. When he was before the Justice he said he went away from us in the Morning before we were up, because he had no Money to pay his Reckoning: But when his Mittimus was made, and he was going to Prison, he said if I would discharge him, he would work his Finger-nails off to make me amends.

If she would tell us where we might take Cock-eye, but she would not consent to her being taken. But the Night after, I being upon the Watch saw her in the Watch-house; O says I, you are Cock-eye, are you not? She said she was not, but at last I found she had been taken up, and left with us, for safety 'till next Morning.

William Davis. I am a Linnen-Draper
 in Cheap side


; between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, the Prisoner White came into my Shop for half an Ell of Holland: Ann Jones came in immediately after her. White paid me for the half Ell of Holland, and was going out: Mr. Hodges, who is likewise a Draper, stopped her, brought her into my Shop, and said she had been in his Shop. and had stole a Piece of Cambrick, therefore he would search her: He got hold of both her Hands and held them out; and a Piece of Lawn dropped from her on the Ground in the Shop: These are my Goods, says he, but they proved to be mine, and was marked in the End. I had just shown some Lawns to a Customer, and several Pieces Lay upon the Counter.
Mr. Hodges. They had been in my Shop just before; I discovered what they were, and clear'd my Counter, that there might be nothing near them. White came in first, and Jones followed her. I could not keep them together, they would be running one to one end, the other to the other end of the Counter. I had just laid 5 Pieces of Cambrick at one end. White had bought a Quarter of a Yard, it was tore off, and was abruptly going away without paying for it: I made her pay for it, and then they went away. As soon as they were gone. I miss'd a Piece of Cambrick, and pursued them to Mr. Davis's Shop. I let her come out a little way into the Street; then I carried her back into his Shop, and to prevent her conveying the Goods away, I held her Arms open; but she got one Hand at liberty, and shook her Petticoats, and I saw the Lawn drop from her, before it came to the Ground, and she endeavoured to kick and spurn it from her.
Several Persons appeared to White's Character.

Sherwin. The Prisoner was my Master's Servant
, on Sunday Feb.1. I was sent to Church in the Afternoon: When I went out, the Box hung up in the Shop: When I came home, it was gone. Jack, says she, do ye know where your Christmas-Box is? I told her, no: I suppose, says she, your Master has put it by for you. I had set down the Customers Names that had put Money in for me, and by Calculation there was about 3l. in it. My Master was out, and no one was in the House that Afternoon, but the Prisoner: When he came home, he taxed her with it, and sent for a Constable; at first she said she knew nothing of it, but afterwards, she said, a Journeyman Apothecary had been there, and had taken it away; my Master was going to take him up, but at last she confess'd it.

When I came home, she asked me where the Box was; I told her, she must know something of it; she denied it at first; then she said, the Apothecary's Man had been there, and he took it: I charg'd the Man with it, but he cleared himself; at last she confessed the Fact, and that she had taken the Money out at the top of the Box: She said, she did not tell the Money, but there was a great deal of Silver in it.
The Person was produced that found the Box, and another Evidence swore she had confessed the taking the Money, and had given it to a Washerwoman.

            . I serve Mr. Nesbit, and had laid the Cloath in the Parlour according to Custom. There were on the Table 4 Salts, four/Salt-Shovels and four Spoons. I shut the Parlour Door, and went down to dress myself then I went into the Parlour again, to mend the Fire, and seeing the Entry dirty, as if somebody had been there, I went down to the Cook, and asked her, if any body had been in the Parlour; she said no: I went in again for something for my Mistress, and found the Salts, the Spoons, and the Salt-shovels were gone. I called the House-keeper, a we look'd into the Buffet, but nothing was taken from thence, nothing but the Plate that was upon the Table. We sent for the Silversmith who made the Plate, and advertised it; but before the Advertisement came to his Hands, the Spoon mentioned in the Indictment, was brought to his Shop, and he stopt it.


                  Archibald 
                  Gilchrist 
               



            . After Mr. Nesbit had lost the Things, he sent for me, and I caused Advertisements to be printed, and left at the Goldsmith's. I offered two Guineas Reward and no Questions ask'd: About 7 o'Clock as the Man who gave out the Bills, was putting one into my Hand, Mr. Newsome came, and told me, he had stopt one of the Spoons, and said he believed he could help us to take the Person that brought it to him.
Mrs. Newsome. The Prisoner at the Bar brought this Spoon to me to be valued; I asked him whose it was; he said it was his own. I told him he must bring somebody to make that appear, before he should have it again, he then went away, and I saw him no more till he was taken up.
Prisoner. I was drinking at Cow cross, and fell into Discourse with a Sea-faring Man: He pulled out a Pack of Cards; I play'd with him and won all his Money; then he pulled off a Ring and would have me play against that: I did not think it was Gold, so I refused; then he pulled out the Spoon, and desired me to lend him Money upon it; I lent him 10s upon it, and won the Money of him again; he said the Spoon was worth 14s. and wanted more Money, I would lend no more till I knew the Value: why then says he, as you live but over the way; I will entrust you with it, go, and see what 'tis worth: I carried it, to this Gentlewoman, and she stopt it. I told her, Madam, I am at present the Owner of the Spoon, but I will go and fetch the Man I had it of, in a Quarter of an Hour: I went back to the Alehouse to look for him, but he was gone. I never absconded but was taken at my own Door.
Gilchrist. We were told by this Gentlewoman, that she had seen the Prisoner go by her Shop with a Woman she had some Knowledge of, and as we were talking about this Affair, a Grubber, one who sweeps the Streets, heard us, and said, if you are talking of Newgate Nan, or Pin Nan, you may find her at a Brandy-shop at Cow-Cross; so we went to Cow-Cross, and enquired for New-gate Nan, or Pin Nan; but the People told us, if we wanted her, it was not for any Thing that was good, and refused to let us know where she was. At last we found out the Grubber, and he said, when we described the Prisoner, he knew him well; a little tidy Fellow, who would spend 4 or 5 Guineas at Cards: The Constable said he had some Knowledge of him, so he got a Warrant and went to look for him, and saw him standing at a Door; I charged the Constable with him, and asked him if he did not know Newgate Nan, or Pin Nan; he said he did not, we carried him to an Alehouse, and presently Newgate Nan came in and asked for him, and said he was her Husband. I went to get the Warrant back'd, and they staid at an Alehouse till I came back, and till I could get a City Constable; then I brought them word to march; and while I was gone, they had drank half a Crown's worth of Liquor; I paid for it, and ordered them to march: G - d D - m your Blood, says Newgate Nan, he shall not sir, till you give me half a Crown's worth more. I went to Newgate, and gave him a Dram to persuade him to tell us where the rest of the Plate was; he said he would return it; say no more says he, a Word to the Wise is enough.

                  Barret 
               



            . I keep a Brandyshop, and sell Gin, and the Prisoner has frequented my House four or five months, I know him to be an honest, sober, civil Man; I never saw him drunk above two or three times in my shop.

                  Chalkley 
               



            . I live right against Hicks's-Hall, and am an Embroiderer. I have known the Prisoner to have followed sometimes Portering, sometimes Coal-heaving, and sometimes carrying a Basket in Newgate-market for his Living; he came home from Sea about 7 Months ago, and I can't deny but that I have heard a Talk of his having been transported, but I cannot say any thing to it.
Prisoner. I should have been glad if the Man I won the Spoon of had been here.
Q. Aye; is it not odd, that the Person you won it of should not appear?
Mrs. Newsome. If he won the Spoon at Cards, he made quick Work of it, for the Spoon was lost about One o'Clock, and he brought it to me before Two. The Jury found him 


               Guilty 4s. 10d.
             And the Prisoner told the Court they had not done him Justice.

            . I keep a Publick House
. On the 20th of January the Prisoner and 2 more came into my House and call'd for Drink; they went away without paying the Reckoning and took the Mug with them. The next Day it was offer'd to Mr. Bond a Silversmith, and we having had Advertisements sent from Goldsmith's-Hall to all the Shops, he sent me Word, and I came to take up Evans.
Bond. Mrs. Evans, and Mrs. Parker came to my Shop early in the Morning, January 21st. Evans had got the Pot under her Apron, she pull'd it out, and Parker said, what don't you know her? 'Tis Mrs. Evans at the end of the Alley. I had a suspicion of them, but I weigh'd it, and told them it came to 4 l. 18 s. 9 d. Evans said if it came to no more she should lose Money by it, for she had lent 7 l. on it. I advised her to acquaint the Person she had it of, that it was worth no more; and so they went away. About an Hour afterward, Parker came and asked me if that was the most I would give for it. I told her, it was as much as it came to, at 5 s. an Ounce. Well, says she, Mrs. Evans has try'd, and she can't get more, so she desires you to send the Money for it. No. I told her I did not care to meddle with it at all: Why, says she, you don't think it stolen, do you? you don't hear me charge you, says I. As soon as she was gone. I search'd my Warnings, and did not find the Pot advertis'd But about out an Hour and a Half after, the Man brought a Notice of it: says I, the Pot was here about an Hour and half ago, a Neighbour of mine has got it to sell. I was telling another Neighbour this Master, and he say'd he knew Silvester, and would tell him, and bring him to me. He did so, and I told him, if I had had his Warning a little sooner, I could have stop'd the Pot. He was for having a Warrant to take them up, but I desired him to go and speak to them first. I went with him, and took Evans aside, and told her I had got a Customer, who wanted such a Thing; she said it was too late, she had sold it to another for more, and to one too who had asked no Questions. He got a Warrant for them; and Evans told us then that she had sold it to Mr. Green in the Minories I went thither, but he had it not: but at the next Shop, (Mr. Boddy's we found it.

            . The Prisoner at the Bar and another Woman, came to my Shop the 22d of January. The other Woman whose Name was Parker, had been in my Shop often. I gave 4 l. 18 s. 6 d to Evans for the Pot.

            . The Man at the Bar and two more came to drink at our House: They sat very near the Bar, and I saw them serv'd with every Thing they call'd for: The Reckoning came to 19 d. halfpenny; and while I stept up Stairs, tho' I staid not above a Minute, before I could get down again, they were gone, without paying a Farthing, and had taken the Mug with them.
Prisoner George. I was sick at the Queen's Head at Shoreditch when one of the Men came in and ask'd me if I knew 
               
                  Daniel

             and Country-Jack, they asked me, if they were in the House; I knew nothing at all of the Mug, nor of the three Men, who were drinking there.
Prisoner Evans. Mrs. Parker brought the Mug to me, she desired me to sell it for her: she owed me 20 s. and I was to be paid when the Mug was sold. I went with her to sell it, and know nothing how she came by it.
- Matthews. The Day Evans was taken up she told me, she had had the Mug 4 Years, and had lent 7l. upon it. I press'd her to tell the Truth, and then she said she found it in the Entry, as she was shutting up her Windows.
- Bond. When we had her before the Justice, he told her in our hearing, she was in an Information, for receiving Lead and other stolen Goods.

Several Persons appeared to the Character of Evans, but George had nothing material to say in his Defence.

Elizabeth Wingfield. On the 9th of January about 8 at Night, I was in a back Room, behind my Shop, at (Lime-house

            , and one Bird, and myself committed this Robbery: Busk shoved up the Sash, and Bird ran away with a Bundle of blue Bird-ey'd, and a Bundle of Copper coloured Handkerchiefs, a Bundle of white Linnen, and a Bundle of chequ'd Linnen. We sold them to Elen. Willford for 7s - we call her Irish Nell.

D. Whalebone, Busk, and Bird's Wife sold them to her for 7s.
Holderness. Lawrence the Constable on the other side of the Water, had been looking after Dumpling, and he desired me to seize him if I should see him. While I was at work in Leaden-hall-street, I thought I saw him go by; I went after him, and charged him with stealing a shew Glass, he desired to be made an Evidence and put Busk into an Information. I went to Kent street to look for him, as I had been directed, and searched the House, but could not find him: at last we made a Woman who was sitting in the Chimney Corner get up, and found Busk upon his Hands and Knees under the Woman's Petticoats; she had been sitting upon his Back. When he was carryed to the Constable, he desired to be made an Evidence: I told him I would speak to Lawrence about it, if he could do any thing to save his Life: Lawrence would do nothing without the Advice of Justice Lade; he admitted Dumpling to be an Evidence, and then Busk cryed, G - d - my Eyes I shall be jamm'd this time; I wish I might either lye in Jayl, or be transported, but I shall be jamm'd now. He mentioned this Robbery, but could not remember the Particulars, and confessed he had knocked a Boy down in Ratcliff-high way, and took his Hat.
Pris. Busk. 'Tis the Practice of these Thief-takers to take up young Fellows, make them drunk, and get them to say what they would have them, that they may take their Lives away for the sake of the Reward.
Pris. Willford. I never laid out a Half-penny with these Creatures in my Life.
- Mitchell. I know Willford has a very ill Character, and has been tryed before this, at Kingston Assizes.
D. Whalebone. I have sold Irish Nell a great many stolen Goods. On the 30th of January I sold her a Coat for 6 s. I took it from a Coach-Box, and she knew I made it; and on the 1st of February, she bought a Looking-Glass, and gave me 6 s. for that.

            . The Goods mentioned in the Indictment were my Mother-in-law's, Mrs. Gresswell. She has been confined to her Bed a great while, therefore could not attend here. The young Prisoner lodged at one Mrs. Grigson's, who keeps a Chandler's Shop, and she having a large Quantity of Candles, which she offered to Sale, the Officers of the Excise, suspecting them to have paid no Duty, seized them: They were found to belong to Mrs. Gresswell; upon Enquiry, Grigson owned she had them of Yates the younger: He sted from his Lodging, out at a Back-Do
or, but was taken afterwards in Farthing-Fields, Wap. ping, and before the Justice gave a very frivolous Account of the Fact. We then enquired after the Father; he was employed as a private Watchman by Mrs Gresswell and others, beside the publick Watch, to look after their Houses. Mrs. Gresswell's Cellar-Door had frequently been open'd in the Night, and the Watch-man never gave them notice of it: He was asked the Reason of his giving no notice when the Cellar was open'd, and he told us, he always shut it, and stuck it close with Clay, when it had been open'd: There were some Candles found upon him which he would give no Account of, and therefore the Justice committed him.

            . Now I am Apprentice to Mrs. Gresswell. We frequently found the Cellar Door open, tho' they watch'd for us. I saw 7 Dozen and odd Pounds which were taken by the Constable out of the House; I know them to be my Mistress's Candles, by the Colour, the length of the Cotton, and the drawing off. Young Yates confess'd he sold them to Mrs. Grigson for 3 s. and a Dozen; before Justice Martin, he said the Candles were brought to him by a Man on Tower-hill, but he could give no Account of him, but he own'd his selling them to his Land-lady.

                  Cogan

                  Bray 
               



            , Constable. I have some of the Goods, taken upon the Old Gentleman; and at the Place where the Young one lodged we found 71 Pounds conceal'd in Paper. We found but 3 Candles on the old one. When Young Yates was carry'd before the Justice, he said he had the Candles from one Stevens a Watchman belonging to the Custom-house, and that they were Perquisites belonging to his Place.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Grigson 
               



             was call'd again, and appear'd.
Grigson. He lodg'd in my House, (the young one) and he brought the Candles in, as Perquisites belonging to a Watchman of the Custom-house, and I received them as such.
Yates, junior. I saw the Cellar Door open'd one Night by a Coach Wheel, and I thought there was no need of disturbing them. How the Candles came into my Room, I cannot tell. I found them under the Stairs, when I went to look for a bit of Wood to make a Fire.
Yates, junior. I lodged in Grigson's House, and was out of Business. She asked me one Time to go along with her a little Way; I went with her to Tower-hill; we met a Man, she took a Box from him, and said to me Dick carry the Box home for me. I did, and left her with the Man; when she came home she bid me carry the Box up Stairs; whereof I did, it was full of Candles, and I weigh'd them.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Holden 
               



            . I was coming over Tower hill, I can't say for the Day of the Month, but it was about 5 in the Morning, and I met Yates the Younger: I asked him how he and his Father did; he desired me to lend him a half-penny for a Dram: This Grigson was with him, and had a Box which she desired Yates to carry over the Hill for her, and she said she would give him 6d. He asked her whether he must carry it up, or leave it belows Stairs; she said, carry it up. I don't know what was in the Box, but I believe she keeps a very disorderly House.
Constable. We found the major Part of the Candles done up in Dozens in Papers, some few in a Box.
Justice Martin. When the Boy, and the Witness was before me, he continued in the same Story, that they had them of a Watch-man, belonging to the Custom-house, and that they were brought to him, to a Bulk upon Tower-Hill, and that he carried them to this Witness to sell for him. I asked him if he could find this Man, and he said he could not.
Yates, jun. Mrs. Grigson bid me say such and such Words before the Justice; whereof I being ignorant of any such Affair, did so. She hired me once when a Box came in, to carry a Letter and the Box to her Mother's at St James's; whereof I did so, and her Mother when she had read the Letter, paid me 18s.


                  Richard 
                  Farrow 
               



            . I was with him when he carried the Box to St. James's I was out of Work, and he asked me to go with him, and he received 18s. 6d.
Yates, jun. And I paid it to her, and she paid me for my Trouble. She sold them out of her Shop at a half penny a piece.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Holder 
               



            . I sent my Daughter for a half penny Candle. and she brought me one so large, made me think there was some Mistake so I went to her about it, and she told me she would sell' 3lb together so, if I would buy them.
Yates, sen. 

               acquitted

, in the Parish of St. Botolph Aldgate


.
John Strahan. On the 19th of January, between 10 and 11 at Night, I was coming along the Minories


 and tumbled down: the Prisoner took hold of me, and asked me for a Dram: Well Woman, says I, because you are so civil, I will give you a Dram; I have an Acquaintance hard by, says she, and we'll have it there. I was a Stranger in that Place, therefore I went with her; they called for a Dram.
Q. They - was there more than one?
Strahan. Yes, my Lord, there was three of them in all; and I gave them all three a Dram, and then I sat down by the Bed-side, and fell asleep. 'Tis not a Dram-shop, my Lord, nor was I on the Bed, but by the Bed-side: I was asleep in two or three Minutes after I came in, and the Prisoner took that Opportunity to pick the Watch out of my Pocket.
Q. How did you know she took your Watch, if you was asleep?
Strahan. I wak'd and saw it in her Hand, and said, Woman, don't take my Watch from me; but the Landlord came and took me by the Collar, and shook me up and down the House. I am a Scotchman, my Lord, and unacquainted with such ways; I told the Landlord, the Woman had my Watch; you Villain says he, pay your Reckoning and get out of my House; so I threw down three Half-pence, but he told me, the Drams came to 6 d. I paid him 6 d. and he took the three Half-pence too, and push'd me out of doors. I made a Noise, and one of the Neighbours fetched this Gentleman, a Constable, from the Watch, but they had put out all the Candles and lock'd the Door, so we could do nothing that Night. The next Morning I got a Warrant for the Man and his Wife, but he was fled; I carried the Wife before Sir 
               
                  Richard 
                  Brocas 
               



            , and he came down to see after his Wife; and calling me aside, told me I might find the Watch in the Prisoners Bosom; this Gentleman found the Woman, and took the Watch out of her Bosom.

            , Constable. About 12 the same Night, the Prosecutor told me he was robb'd in an Alley in the Minories; I went down to the House, but could not get in. The next Day, at Sir Richard Brocas's, I saw the Man that keeps this House; he call'd me aside, and told me Grace Williams had the Watch, and I might find her at some of the Brandy-shops in the Minories or Petticoat-Lane: I found her at a House where they sell Sheeps-heads and Drams, in Moses and Aaron Alley, in Petticoat-Lane: She damn'd me and would not be search'd; but I search'd her and took the Prosecutor's Watch out of her Bosom. She told me the Man of the House had got the 2 Seals.

             came to me to be hired as a Servant
; she said, she had not been above a Fortnight in Town, but Mr. Williams the Prisoner, was a Relation of her's; and as he had liv'd in the Neighbourhood 14 Years, I thought I might depend upon him for her Character. I sent for him, and he told me, she had not liv'd any where in Town, but if he was worth a thousand Pounds he would give that Security for her honesty; I told him, our Service required a trusty Servant; but as you are an honest Neighbour, I believe I may depend upon you; so upon his Character I took her. She had not lived with me above a Week, but I miss'd a pair of double Ruffles, which cost me 7 l. I desir'd Mr. Daffey to part with her, for I was sure she was a Pilferer; he said, we could not do without a Servant, and we must therefore watch her. I believe she had convey'd away most of the Goods mention'd in the Indictment before; she took away (for ought I know) Things to the value of 200 l.
Mr. Bird. I saw her Confession sign'd; she own'd the taking of 2 Table-cloths, 2 Sheets, 6 Pewter Plates, 6 Glasses, 2 Chocolate-cups, 2 Tea-cups, 2 Saucers, 3 Pound of Candles, an Earthern Flower-pot, a pair of double Ruffles, and some other things, which she could not recollect.

                  Daffey

                  Williams 
               



            's.
Mrs. Daffey. When I found I was robb'd, I sent to Williams directly: he came to our House, and saw the Goods I had taken from her; he said he knew nothing of the Matter; but the next Morning he came and said her Sister Grace had convey'd all the things, which were at his House away to Aldgate.
Mrs. Acton I was at Mr. Daffey's the Night that Williams was sent for, and I told him, he had not done well to recommend a Thief: he said he thought she had been honest, and blam'd Mary Hughes for behaving so wrong: They whisper'd together, but he said not a Word then, of the Boxes which were at his House, nor did we know there were any things at his House, 'till the next Day. The next Morning he came and told us there were Boxes at his House, but Mary's Sister had gutted them by 3 o'Clock in the Morning; when Grace was taken up, she own'd she had taken the Goods out of the Boxes; and that a young Man in the Neighbourhood assisted her to carry them to Duke's-Place: They were brought back by 
               
                  Grace 
                  Hughes 
               



            , Williams and his Wife, and were found to be Mr. Daffey's Goods.
Mrs. Rutter. I was with Mr. Daffey at Sir William Billers's, and while we were there, Mrs. Williams told us, Mary had brought all the things back; she owned that Grace had taken them away at 3 o'Clock in the Morning. Mr. Bird and I were present, when they were open'd in Mr. Daffey's Warehouse; we advis'd her to fetch Grace; she did so, and brought the Boxes and Goods with her to Daffey's Warehouse.
- Thomas. Mary Hughes lived with me as a Servant in April last; she went from me the 24th of June. The Prisoner Williams recommended her to me, as an honest Body, a Country Woman of his, and newly come to Town from Chester. I believed Williams to be an honest Man, and took her on his Character. I presently found she knew the Town as well as I, and that she was a saucy impudent Woman. I lost some things while she lived with me, but as I could not swear any Fact upon her, and she threatned me with the Law if I charged her; I was cautious, and only turn'd her away; she liv'd with me about 5 Weeks.

                  Rutter 
               



            . I was at Mr. Daffey's that Evening the Constable was carrying Mary Hughes away; Williams was sent for, and he said he would meet them at Sir William's, but said not a word of any Goods at his House. The next Morning he said, he was sorry for what had happen'd, and told us there were 2 Boxes and a Trunk at his House, which were sent for to Mr. Daffey's, but they were stripp'd; Grace, he said, had carry'd off the things in the Night; but he would go to Rosemary-Lane where she had lodged some other Boxes and enquire after them.

                  Smith 
               



            . The Prisoner Mary owned the taking the Goods with a design to carry them off, and if I would go to Williams's House I should find them there; but Williams and his Wife told us, 
               
                  Grace 
                  Hughes 
               



             had carry'd them all away in the Night. Mary said, she believ'd we might find her in Barnaby-Street; Williams and his Wife went to see for her, and about 10 o'Clock at night, they came to Mr. Daffey's House with Grace Hughes, and the Goods which Mrs. Daffey claim'd.
Mrs. Daffey. Mary Hughes had left some Boxes, full of other things at Williams's House, but upon Mary's being taken up, Grace had pick'd out all that were mine, and carry'd them away in the Night.
Mary Hughes had nothing material to say in her Defence: and Grace said, she expected Mr. Rawlinson of Hackney to appear to her Character; but no one appearing for either of them; the Jury found both the Hughe's 

               Guilty
            . Several Persons giving Williams a fair Character, he and his Wife were 

               Acquitted

Ambrose Reason. On Twelfth Day last the Prisoner came to me as a Journeyman
; he had not liv'd with me 3 Weeks before he lay out on Sunday Night, and the next Morning when I had open'd my Shop I miss'd 4 Perukes: they were my own, and worth 15 l. - About 11 o'Clock he came home; I charg'd a Constable with him, but he deny'd the Fact, even before Sir

I went to one Mrs. Barnes's at St. James's, knowing he used to resort to her, and told her Perkins had robb'd me; she promis'd to come to my House the next Day, but did not: After this, he sent for me and confess'd one of the Perukes was at Barnes's; and inform'd me where he had dispos'd of the rest.
- Crisp. I bought this Wig in my own House on a Sunday; Mrs. Barnes brought it to me, and I gave 25 s. for it.
Reason. This very Wig I made for Mr. Dutch, and was to have had 5 Guineas for it.
Mrs. Barnes. He us'd to bring Wigs to my House; what I did was on his Friends Account, who lives next Door to me. He left the Wigs at my House when I was abroad, and had before shewn one of them to another Man; my Husband told Mr. Crisp he could help him to a Wig, a Penniworth; they could not agree, but Perkins afterwards sold it him for 25s. I was surprized when Mr. Reason came to my House, and did not think of telling him what I knew of the Affair.
The Prisoner said he was very sorry it should happen so
The Jury found him 


               Guilty, 4s. 10d.

.
Joshua Thompson. The Prisoner and another Woman, came into my Shop on Monday last, and asked to see some Cloaks: They were at first for a Cloath-colour'd one; then they would have it Scarlet: After they had try'd on several, they bid me 10 s. for one, and we parted for 6 d. Mr. Turcan was at the Door when they went out: He came in, and asked me, if I had sold them any Thing; I told him, no; they have got something, says he; so I went after them, which the other Woman perceiving, she slept between me and the Prisoner, to give her an Opportunity of throwing the Cloak into an Entry. I did not see her throw it there, but as I followed her, I saw the Edge of it under her Cloak, and there I found it. I laid hold of the Woman, who I was sure had the Cloak, and while I was busie with her, the other got away.
Mr. Turcan.

It was my Landlady that was with me at this Gentleman's Shop: She wanted to buy a Cloak, and bid 10 s. for one; the Gentleman would not take it, so we came out; and as we were going along, See here, says I, what need we go any further? here's a very handsome Cloak lies here in the Entry, upon which up comes this Gentleman and seiz'd me, and the People told him, he must swear it downright upon me; his Wife, my Lord, promised my Husband, I should be kept in the Round-house only till next Day; and as soon as he was gone, they sent me to Jayl.

 Dobson; then he made himself an Evidence, and by his Directions, we took Nixon, and found five of my Fowls alive at one Nevet's in the &ack lane, Well-street. Nevet denied them, but upon searching with a Warrant, I found five in his House.

We went down and broke the Pales, and took out two Cocks and 8 Hens; 5 of which we sold to Nevet alive; 2 we sold dead over against Nevet's House; two we sold in Petticoat-lane, and one we gave away: When the Fowls were disposed of, we all three went into Petticoat-lane; there we shared the Money, and bought a Hog's Face, which we eat in an Alehouse.
Nevet appeared, and was examined; but the Court understanding that he was indicted as an Accessary, the Jury was inform'd that they must not regard his Evidence.
Dobson's Defence.
I met with Dodd and Nixon in Well Street, and they made me drink half a Pint of Gin; I was drunk, and went with them to the Corner of the Lane; I stood at the Corner, and they brought the Fowls to me.

HENRY JUSTICE, hold up your Hand.
Justice. My Lord, 'Tis my Misfortune to be very Deaf, I beg I may be permitted to come nearer to your Lordship.
Clerk of Arr. Can't you hear there?
Justice. I am very Deaf, and have a wretched Cold, which has stuck by me all the Winter: (Then he was permitted to come to the Inner Bar) I hope I shall be allow'd the Liberty of Pen and Ink; and as there have been many Books seized at my Chambers, which can be proved not to belong to Trinity College, I hope your Lordship will order them to be restored me.
Then the Indictment was read.
Justice. My Lord, I observe in this Indictment, here is mentioned a much less Number of Books, than was taken from my Chambers; therefore, I hope, those that are not mentioned in the Indictment, may be restored me; or else they may bring another Indictment for the rest; and those that are in the Indictment I must abide by.
He pleaded Not guilty.
Then the Jury were sworn, whose Names are as follows:

            , against the Peace of our said Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.
Mr. Greaves, of Council with the King, open'd the Indictment, and Mr. Attorney General open'd the Evidence in a very eloquent Speech.
Then the Reverend Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Wilson 
               



             was call'd, and the Charter of the University, was produced and read.
Justice. No one has prov'd that Charter: They should be obliged to shew that Trinity College was incorporated by Letters Patent: there is no time mentioned in the Indictment when it was incorporated: And as Mr. Attorney General has opened the Indictment, they should produce the Warrant, by Virtue of which they seized the Books.
Council. What Book is that in your Hand Sir?
Wilson. This is, Opus novum Gildas Britannus Monachus, cui Sapientis Cognomentum est inditum de Calamitate excidio & Cononeila Britaniac, quam Angliam nane vocant, author vetustus, a multis diu desideratus & nuper in Gratiam D. Cuthberti Tonstalli Londinen. Episcopi formulis excusus.
Justice. Is that the whole Title of the Book?
Wilson. 'Tis all that is in the Indictment.
Justice. Read the whole Title of the Book: Is it in the Indictment?
Council for the Prisoner. We have an Objection to make to all the Books on this Account: In the Indictment they say Triate Col.
C. K. 'Tis so in the Charter. 'Tis not necessary to set forth every Thing that is mentioned in the Title Page; for the Description of the Book and the Title Page, are two different Things. The Title is set forth, tho' what giveth an Account of the Contents of the Book be omitted.
Wilson. The next is intituled, Literarum quibus invictissimus Princeps Henricus Octavus Rex Angliae et Franciae, Dns Hiberniae ac Fidei Defensor, respondit ad quandam Epistolam Martini Lutheri ad se missam, et ipsius Lutheranae quoq; Epistolae Exemplum, value 5 s. in the Indictment.
C. P. How is Dominus spelt there?
Wilson. Dns.
C. K. 'Tis not material, tho' there be a Contraction in one Place, and the whole Word be set forth in another.
C. K. What was the Value of the first Book?
Wilson. 'Tis a curious scarce Book, that Gildas; it has, I know, been sold for 10 s. a curious Man would give more: I value this at a Crown.
C. K. What is the Worth of Luther?
Wilson. Half a Crown.
Justice. What, worth Half a Crown, and imperfect?
C. K. Make some Allowance, if there be a Leaf wanting.
Wilson. 'Tis worth Half a Crown still I believe.
C. K. Go to the next Sir.
Wilson. This is Gulielmi Postelli Baren. Doleriensis de Onginibus seu de Hebraicae Linguae & Gentis Antiquitate; deque variarum Linguarum affinitate Liber.
Justice. Does the Title end there?
C. Yes, this Title ends at Liber.
Justice. I beg to look at that Book.
C. K. What's the Value of this Book?
Wilson. One Shilling.
C. K. What is the next, Sir?
Wilson. I will take them in Order. The next is Pyramidographia, or a Description of the Pyramid in Egypt, by 
               
                  John 
                  Greaves 
               



            . The Indictment mentions four Tracts bound up together; we found them separate as they are now; but I remember them bound up together in the Library: I remember them particularly.
. If they were in the Library bound up together, and have afterwards been separated, they may be said to be one Book, containing four Tracts: Pulling off the Cover alters not the Thing at all.
Justice. I ask whether or no these Books at the Time of finding the Indictment, and taking them from me, were then in one Book as laid in the Indictment. Can Mr. Wilson say they were bound all together when they were taken?
Wilson. I cannot say they were. But I had them at my Chamber bound all together; and I lent them to the Master of Pembroke bound all together; and there's an Account of the four Parts wrote upon a Leaf, which I don't find now.


                  Charles 
                  Mason 
               



            . I remember they were bound together, but I can't be certain whether these Tracts were the 4 that were bound in this very Cover; but I remember, a Scholar desired he might have the Use of it, and I got it from the Master of Pembroke, and lent it him, and returned it to the Library about 3 Months before Mr. Justice went away; when I returned it, they were all bound together in a brown Calf-Skin Cover.
Another Witness. That was the Book that was lent to the Master of Pembroke, and I remember the Tracts were bound up in a brown Cover.
C. K. What were the Tracts contain'd in that Book?
C. Mason. Pyramidographia, or a Description of the Pyramids of Egypt; a Discourse o the Roman Foot and Denarius, by John Greaves Jacobi Usserii Armachani Macedonici Asianorum Anno Solari Dissertatio Graecorum Astronomorum Parapemateiad Macedonici & Juliani Anni Rationes accommodato, and Roberti Stephani Notae Novum Testamentum. This last was an imprfect Piece.
C. K. What is the Value of the Pyramids?
Wilson. I asked the Price of that, and I  could not get one under 10 s. 6 d. The Deescription of the Pyramids, and the Discourse of the Roman Foot are reckoned very curious Piece
C. K. What is Usher's Book worth?
Wilson. About 18 d. Stephanus is imp, is worth 6 d. I believe.
Justice. If I mind the Indictment right, it says, Book containing 4 Tracts; the Pyramids and Roman Foot: Usher & Robertus Stephanus in Novum Testamentum.
C. K. The different Tracts have been mentioned: and here is the Stephanus.
Wilson. The next is an Epitaph of D. Edmund Bonner: declaring the Life and End of D. Edmund Bonner: And another made by a Papist, in Praise of D Edmund Bonner, and set up in Paul's Cross: Also a Reply to a scandalous Lie cast abroad in Defence of D. Edmund Bonner The Value I believe is 1 Shilling, and Authores rei venaticae antiqui cum Commentariis Jam Ulitii ad Christinam Augustam.
C. K. What is the next Book?
Wilson. De Francicae Linguae recta pronunciatione Theodoro Beza Auctore.
C. K. What is the Value of this?
Wilson. One Shilling I believe Sir.
C. K. While they are looking for the next Book, I will ask you Sir, whether you believe all these belong to Trinity College Library?
Wilson. I believe they do: The next is Bonner's Articles, but they are not at hand: The next is, La Bibliotheque D'
               
                  Antoine 
                  du Verdier 
               



             Seigneur de Vauprivas: This was found in Mr. Justice's Bureau, and has Trinity College Arms upon it. We can prove the Book to belong to the Library.
C. K. Mr. Hutchinson, had you such a Book in the Library?
Hutchison. It is now missing from the Library; it was there within these 2 Years.
C. K. Mr. Wilson, when did you see this Book there?
Wilson. I know by the Catalogue there was such a Book there, I can't remember I have seen it: 'Tis not now in the Class referr'd to in the Catalogue; here is the Arms of the College upon it.
C. P. I would ask whether Books may not often be misplaced in the Library, and put into an improper Class?
Wilson. 'Tis possible, but not commonly so.
C. P. I would ask whether the Books in the Library are chain'd?
Wilson. No. they are not.
C. P. Are they all loose?
Wilson. Yes: and any of the Fellows have Liberty to borrow a Book.
C. K. What is the Value of the Book, of which that Leaf was the Title?
Wilson. About 10 s.
C. K. What is the next?
Wilson. The next is, Jacobi Sadoleti de laudibus Philosophiae, Libri duo. And the Value of this is 2 s. The next is, D. Camerarius de Fortitudine, Doctrina & Pietate Scotorum: The Title is wanting: The current Title begins with the Words Introductio Generalis.
C. P. Then this is not in the Indictment.
C. K. We can put it by; we have enough without it. What is the next?
Wilson. La Methode nouvelle & Invention extraordinaire de dresser les Chevaux les travailler selon la Nature & parfair la Nature par la Subtilite de Part; la quelle n'a jamaisete trouvee que par le tres noble haut & tres puissant Prince Guillaume, Marquis & Comptede Newcastle. I know not the Value of this myself, but I have known some Gentlemen have given 10 l. for it.
Justice. Let me see the Book: I know it very well: I know not whether 'tis material or not, but Newcastle is imperfect; here is one Leaf paged 5. and the next Leaf is 7.
C. K. How come you to know this so suddenly?
Justice. I own the Book was found in my Chamber.

Wilson. The next is Notitia Monastica, or a short History of the Religious Houses in England and Wales, by 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Tanner 
               



            .
C. K. What is the Value of that?
Wilson. About a Guinea; 'tis a very scarce Book. The next is D.Junii Juvenalis Satyrae; the Louvre Edition: I have seen it valued in a Catalogue at 10 or 12 s.
C. K. Go to the next, Sir.
Wilson. The next is sacrae Scripturae veteris noviq; Testa mentiomnia. This is an Aldus Edition, a very valuable Book, worth three orfour Guineas.
C. K. What is the next?
Wilson. I quattro Libri dell' Architettura di Andrea Palladio, the value of this is one Guinea or a Guinea and half.
The next is Les Memoires de Messire 
               
                  Philippe 
                  de Comines 
               



            , Seigneur d'Argenton; the Paris Edition, Value 1 l. 1 s.
C. K. Pray go to the next, Sir.
Wilson. The next are three Volumes. The first is, Prima Pars Romanae Urbis Topograhiae & Antiquitatum; and all the Volumes consist of two Parts. The 2d Part is, Secunda Pars Antiquitatum Romanorum seu Topographia Romanae Urbis.
C. P. The Title is not compleat in the Indictment, the Title of the Book ends at Accuratissine, and not at Antiquitatum.
C. K. I believe it is so; lay them by.
Wilson. The next is, Addenda to the Statutes at large.
C. P. All the Title here too, is not in the Indictment. (This was laid by likewise).
Wilson. The next in the Indictment, is, the Statutes at Large, beginning, &c.
C. P. You have not all the Title; 'tis only the Statutes at Large, in the Indictment. This was laid by also.
Wilson. The next is the French Plutarch: Les Vies des Hommes illustres Grecs & Romains comparees l'une avec l'autre, par Plutarch de Chaeronee; it is worth two Guineas. The next is Quinti Horatij Flacci a Louvre Horace, worth about a Guinea. The next is an English Field's Bible. The Title is, The Holy Bible, consisting the Books of the Old and New Testament.
C. K. What is the Value?
Wilson. Twenty Guineas, both of them.
C. K. What is the next?
Wilson. The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacrements, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England; with the Psalter or Psalms of Devil. This and the other I value at twenty Guineas.
C. K. Go on, Sir.
Wilson. This is Godefridi Bidleo, Medicinae Doctoris & Chiruurgi Anantomia Humani Corporis.
C. P. This is a Copper-Plate; and not set forth right in the Indictment.
Wilson. The next is, De Bello Belgico Decas prima Famianae Stradae, Rom. Soc. Jesu. I value the two Vols. at a Guinea, they are worth more.
The next is, Vetus Testamentum multiplici Lingua nune primo impressum: & imprimis Pentatenchus Hebraico Greco atq; Chaldaico Idiomate, adjuncta unicuiq; sua Latina Interpretatione: Here are four Volumes, and this is the Complatensian Edition, worth about twenty Guineas.
Mr. Richardson. The next is the Aeschylus; but while we were in Mr. Justice's Chamber, that was convey'd away.
(The Council for the King, did not think proper to take up any more Time in proving the Books, but went to the Fact.)
C. K. Do you remember that Gildas to have been in the Library?
Wilson. I cannot say I do; but there is a particular mark on it, by which we know it to be ours. We found many of our Books in the Library defac'd: Prints taken out of curious Books, some of which were found at Mr. Justice's, and made a Report to the College of what we found there.
C. K. Give an Account how this was discovered.
Wilson. 'Tis known (I suppose) that there was a Report of the Temple Library being robb'd; this gave us a Suspicion that the Libraries with us had suffered likewise. On that Occasion we examined Trinity Library, and found many Books wanting, and many defaced. The Vice-Chancellor then commissioned the Register to consult Lawyers, that we might know what was proper to be done: And according to their Advice, Mr. Allen, Mr. Hutchenson our Librarian, and my self, were sent up in January last, to take the Direction of Council, in order to our proceeding further in this Business: We waited on Mr. 
               
                  Baron 
                  Thomson 
               



            , and he gave us a Search-Warrant: We search'd Mr. Justice's Chambers, and there we found all the Books that have now been produced in Court.
C. K. Is there any Marks on that Book by which you know it to be yours?
Wilson. I found several Tracts taken out of books of Miscellanies: These I laid aside, and gave Account of them to the College: Mr. Jackson examined the Library particularly, and found this Volume in my Hand with the Tracts cut out. King Henry the Eighth's Answer to Luther was cut out of this Book: Upon the Leaves of it (23) being marked, the Belly of the 3 was wanting: And this very Tract we found in his Chambers, and putting it in that part of the Volume, from whence it had been taken, it tally'd exctly, and made up exactly the Figure 3, which before was deficient; and this Volume I had out of the Library
Mr. Jackson. The Gildas was cut out likewise of another Volume. On the Inside of the Binding there is a Catalogue of the Tracts contained therein; this was wanting and was found at Mr. Justice's Chambers. It comes in, in the same Order, as mentioned in the Catalogue, the Colour of the Leaves is the same, and it tallies exactly: And for a farther Confirmation there is the Coll. Arms upon it. There is another Tract wanting, which we can't find; but we have got the College Catalogue, which mentions every one of them: this was Numb. 32.
C. K. Is it a Manuscript Catalogue?
Jackson. Yes, Sir.
Justice. I submit it to the Court, whether that Catalogue should not be proved by somebody who has compared the Books in the Library with the Catalogue; otherwise the Catalogue can be of no Service: Besides, how does it appear that these Books ever were in the Library.
C. K. What, must we bring a Man to prove a Catalogue, that was wrote, perhaps, a Hundred Years ago?
Jackson. I believe it to be a true Catalogue: I found the Volume, out of which these Tracts were taken, by the Help of Catalogue.
C. K. I would ask you Sir, whether as far as you have compared it, it is always been found agreeable to the Books.
Jackson. As far as I have observed, 'tis an accurate Catalogue.
C. K. Have you often seen him in the Library?
Wilson. I have often seen him there last Summer, but never observed what he was doing; he came from College in October (I think.) He entered himself a Gentleman Commoner, in August was two Years.
C. K. Was the Postellus Hebraicae Linguae in the Library?
Jackson. By Mr. Wilson's giving an Account of the Tract, I found the Volume in which it was bound, in the Library thus mutilated: the Tract was missing: here is a Catalogue of the Tracts in the Book, and putting this in its Place, from whence it was cut, it fitteth exactly: and the College Arms are upon it. We found it in Mr. Justice's Chamber.
Justice. I acknowledge all this; 'tis all true; but I would -
C. K. Don't confess what you should not. Did not you take this Book from Trinity College?
Justice. I can't say that I - But before I was sent to Newgate, I would ask Mr. Wilson, whether I did not own to you Mr. Wilson (Here Mr. Justice burst into Tears, and when he had composed himself, he went I would ask whether I did not own I had a great Number of Trinity College Books: Did not I own it, before I was taken up by Warrant from Baron Thomson? Did not I acknowledge it? Did not I give you up the Key of my Chambers, that you might take them?
Wilson. We had some Conversation with you, and you did say you had many Books belonging to Trinity, and you did say we might take them; but it was thought adviseable not to do so, as there were Warrants out. We were advised to proceed regularly, by Warrant from Mr. Baron Thomson.
Mr. Justice. And when you found them in my Chamber, were not many of them directed to my Tutor? Was not Professor Taylor my Tutor? Was there not two Boxes of Books packed up and directed to Professor Taylor? And was there not in one of them, a Letter to him?
Q. When was it you searched Mr. Justice's Chambers and found the Books?
Wilson. It was on the Monday. Mr. Justice did say on the Saturday we might take the Books, but we did not obtain the Search-Warrant till Monday. Mr. Justice was in Custody when the two Boxes were packed up, and had been in the Custody of the Constable three Days, at the Bolt and Tun.
C.K. Were the Books pack'd up before or after Notice was sent to Cambridge?
Wilson. After.
Justice. I admit I had a great Number of these Books, and that a great many of them belong to Trinity College: I was so far from altering them or defacing them, that the Arms of the College are in many of them to this Hour. I would not give the Court trouble, I admit them all, and never did deny it.
C.K. Which Books were in the Boxes, and which were not packed up?
Wilson. Juvenal was in one of the Boxes; The Aldus Bible, Palladio, the Complut. Bible, the Statutes at Large, the French Plutarch, the Paris Horace, Field's Bible and Common-Prayer, and Strada, were in Boxes.
Justice. Was there not more in the Boxes than are in the Indictment?
Wilson. Yes; Gildas was not packed up, that we found in his Chamber. Henry the 8th's Answer to Luther, Postellus, Beza de Francicae Pronunciationis, Newcastle's Horsemanship, were not packed up: Greaves's Pyramids, the Account of the Roman Foot, Sadeletus, Bonner's Epitaphs, Authores reivenatica, these were not pack'd-up; there are more mentioned in the Indictment, but you have not gone thro' them, so they have not come before you.
C.K. Were any of the Tracts taken out of the Volumes packed up?
Wilson. No, none of them.
Justice. Have you done with Mr. Wilson? I would ask him, whether it is not usual to give Pupils leave to take what Books they have occasion for? Mr. Wilson is a Tutor himself.
Wilson. It is; to take them regularly sending a Note, Permit such a one to take such a Book, and place it to my Account: None of these were placed to Mr. Taylor's Account.
Justice. I would ask whether you remember where my Chambers were?
Wilson. I remember where you liv'd last.
Justice. I would ask you, how far 'tis between the Library and my Chamber?
Wilson. The Library is at some Distance.
Justice. Is it not quite cross both the great Courts?
Wilson. 'Tis not so: Your Chamber is in the first Court, and the Library is by the River.
Justice. I would ask how 'tis possible for any one to carry them away unseen? How came I by this Privilege?
Wilson. That you best know.
C.K. Do you give leave to any but Members of the College to take Books?
Wilson. No.
Justice. And in what Capacity was I?
Wilson. A Fellow Commoner.
Justice. What are the Privileges of Fellow Commoners?
Wilson. They sit at the Fellows Table, and take the other Advantages that Fellows have; they have no Right to take Books ad libitum. You have a Right to take a Book if your Tutor gives leave, and 'tis placed to his Account. Fellow-Commoners we look on as Boarders; they are no part of the Corporation, and have no Right to take Books without this Licence.
Just There are two sorts of Scholars: A Foundation Scholar, who lives on the Stipend of the College; and one who pays for what they have, and are at their own Expence: Don't you look on a Student as a Scholar? did not I on my Admission pay a Guinea, or a Guinea and a half, according to the Custom of the College (as you do) to the Library Keeper.
Wilson. 'Tis paid upon Admission.
Justice. Can you swear these Books were all taken in London?
Wilson. They were taken in your Chambers.
C.P. I asked before, whether there was any Fastening to these Books?
Wilson. None, in Trinity College Library.
Justice. You say, that Tutors licence their Pupils to take Books, and they are entered by Order of the Tutor in the Register Book. Now I would ask you, Sir, whether it is not a frequent Practice to borrow Books without making such Entry?
Wilson. I have something to do with Pupils my self. I write, Let such a Person have such a Book, and place it to my Account.
C. P. You are a cautious Man. I would ask whether any Body can go into the Library without the Librarian's Leave.
Wilson. 'Tis not always open: There are Hours when the Keeper attends. When a Gentleman studies there, he has leave of a Fellow. A Fellow Commoner of a House is indulged with leave to study there; but he can't take them to his Chamber without his Tutor's Note.
C.P. I would ask whether any one can go into the Library without leave of the Librarian?
Wilson. When any come to see the Library, the Librarian walks with the Person: If he comes to study; he has leave to sit down.
Justice. Has it not been common for Books to be wanting in Trinity College Library?
Wilson. There are many Books out: Because Fellows, according to their particular Studies, have particular Books. I have some; Mr.Taylor has some.
C.P. Ask him if they don't keep them 20 or 30 Years? And if they don't bring them away with them to London?
Wilson. If they do, they should not.
C.P. I ask if you don't know of Books belonging to Trinity, now in London?
Wilson. There are a great many here now. I know but of a Volume of Stillingfleet beside, and that is charged on his Head; he is a Fellow, and is now in Court.
Justice. Who is the under Library-Keeper?
Wilson. The present Man's Name is Harris, he is about 18 Years old.
Justice. In relation to a Fellow Commoner, I would ask whether they have not more Privileges than other Graduates.
Wilson. We allow you to go into the Library to study there, not on any other account.
Justice. Are not Fellow Commoners looked upon as superior to Scholars?
Wilson. Yes. -
Justice. What do you mean by a Fellow Commoner?
Wilson. One who sits at the same Table with Fellows, and enjoys their Conversation.
C. P. Pray does Mr. Justice's Name still continue in the Buttery Book? When did you see it last there?
Wilson. His Name was on the Buttery Boards in October, whether it is now taken off or not, I cannot tell.
C. P. Is it not usual for a Fellow Commoner to have the Liberty of taking a Book without a Note from the Tutor?
C. K. And I would ask if he knows they are allowed to take them, not only out of the Library, but out of Cambridge.
C. P. Have you, every time any of your Pupils have wanted a Book, given them a Note?
Wilson. Yes.
C. K. I would ask whether in all your Time, you ever knew leave given to any Body to cut a Treatise out of a Book, carry it away, and leave the rest behind?
Wilson. No.
Mr. Brounker sworn.
C. K. Do you know where Mr. Justice's Chambers are?
Brounker. In London, in Elm Court. We reckon all the east part of Temple-lane to be in London. Take a Line from Sheer-Lane, and run it down to the Water-side, all on this side the Line we reckon in London. All on this Side the Middle-Temple-Lane we call London. New Court and the Garden is called Middlesex. E'm-Court is on this side of Middle-Temple-Lane.
Mr. Atkinson, the Constable was sworn.
C. K. Had you any Search Warrant brought you?
Atkinson. Yes; It was signed by Baron Thomson.
(The Warrant being proved was read)
C. K How did you proceed upon this?
Atkinson. As I am a City Constable, I did not care to serve it in the Temple without leave from the Benchers. I had leave, and with Esquire Taylor, and Mr. Brounker, we found these Books, which I have had in Custody ever since. We took Mr. Justice in his Chambers, and carried him before Baron Thomson on the Wednesday, who asked him Questions, and told him he hoped he could give a good account how he came by them: He said, he thought he could: and the Baron gave him 3 Days to do it in: I was ordered to keep the Books, and he had leave to go at liberty from Wednesday to Saturday: I was ordered to bring him again before the Baron, on Saturday. and he then not giving a good Account how he came by them, he was order'd to get Bail, and 'till he could find Bail, he was to remain in my Custody; I kept him at my House 'till Monday, then I took him again before Baron Thomson, and he committed him.
C. K. Do you know any thing about his packing up Books?
Atkinson. Yes. On Sunday in the Evening he desired I would let him go to his Chambers, to put some Papers in order. I went with him, and he then packed up these Books in order to send them to Cambridge, and put in a Letter to one Mr. Taylor I believe: When the Books were packed up, he went home with me again.
Justice. I don't know whether your Lordship understood him as I do: I think he said, when he came with the Warrant to my Chambers, he found these Books here, or else he speaks of another Parcel of Books.
Atkinson. I don't know whether the Books that are here are the same Books that you pack'd up.
Justice. Did you find any of the Books mentioned in the Warrant?
Atkinson. No.
Justice. I ask you who it was that pressed you to execute the Warrant?
Atkinson. I believe his Name was Kinaston.
Justice. There was a second Warrant granted. When was that? before or after the packing up of the Books?
Atkinson. The Books were packed up, before the second Warrant was granted.
Justice. There was no Warrant against me then for Trinity College.
Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Taylor 
               



            . I am a Fellow of St. John's.
Justice. I beg leave to say one Thing; I have an Objection to the Gentleman's Evidence; it will appear that he was Under Librarian, and had the Care of the University Library.
Taylor. I received Orders from the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge; about Christmas last, to procure a Warrant to search Mr. Justice's Chambers: Baron Thomson granted a Warrant on the 6th of January. On the 7th they were searched, and Mr. Justice taken before the Baron. I saw some Books which were missing in the Library: On Saturday Morning he was before him again, and then he was put into the Constable's Hands; and on Sunday Night I was informed that Mr. Justice was packing up Books: I went to him and asked him the Reason of his packing the Books up; he said, he was advised to do it, but that it was contrary to his own Judgment.
C. K. How came the Gentlemen of Trinity to suspect Mr. Justice?
Taylor. The Gentlemen desired me in my Search for the University Library, to look for Newcastle's Horsemanship; I saw it in Mr. Justice's Chambers, and sent them word of it.
Justice. When you came to search, was not my Study Door lock'd?
Taylor. Yes.
Justice. When I gave you the Key, did you find any of the Books mentioned in the Warrant?

Taylor. No.
Justice. My Lord, when they came to my Chambers, tho' my Name was not in the Warrant, yet I freely let them search, and they found none of the Books mentioned in the Warrant. There was a Trunk that was lock'd; I opened it, and there was nothing there that they wanted. I will go farther, to shew how willing I was to give Satisfaction, I let Mr. Taylor and Mr. Brounker the next Day search, even my very Cellar, without Constable or Warrant. On their second coming, they found me at Liberty, and my Doors open, and they can't say there was any Obstruction to their searching.
Taylor. There were some Covers of Books in the Cellar.
(The Council for the King rested the Evidence here, and the Prisoner was called on to make his Defence.
Justice. My Lord, I acknowledge, as I always did, and have now done, that I had the Books. I apprehend, I had Authority to take them. First, a General Authority to take what Books I wanted, out of the Library. Secondly, An Authority in my own Right, as a Scholar of the College; and if this appears, this Matter will be so far from being Felony, that it can't be a Trespass. I intended to return them, and this may appear from my declaring that I had them, delivering up my Keys, and packing them up before the Warrant for the College-Books was granted. There was no Warrant against me for the College-Books, before I endeavoured to send them away. As to the Matter of my being a Scholar; it will appear from the Statutes, there are two sorts of Scholars. From the Statute 25 Sept. 12. Eliz. where 'tis said, Nullus Scholaris quicunq; &c From this Statute it appears, that there are stipendiary Scholars, who receive Money or Victuals, who are supported by the College, and Scholars who live at their own Expence; of which Number I am one: And if any Doubt arises on that, I hope these Gentlemen (my Council) will be permitted to argue for me. But I apprehend, if I had no Right as a Scholar of the College, yet I hope this Clause in the 2d of Eliz. Chap. 14. which says, Omnes Scholasticos, &c. will give me the Right of a Fellow. I beg leave to observe, that the constant Word in all Statutes and Chapters, when a Scholar is spoken of, is Scholaris: A Foundation-Scholar is called Discipulus, and I must be the Scholaris. The Pensionaries are the Stipendiaries of the College. Fellow-Commoners have always the same Privileges with Fellows. My Lord, I was so far from secreting these Books, that 'tis intirely owing to the Negligence of a Child, whom they have made Library-Keeper, that my Name was not entered with the Books, according to my Order. But if I had not ordered them to be entered, yet by the Statutes it cannot be a Felony. They lay openly in my Room; they have the College Arms on them, and have particular Marks: Could any body (intending to secret them) be so mad, as to let them lie about openly, with these Marks. There were many Books I intended to send down, before there were any Complaints against me, but they would not suffer me. I had a Message from my Tutor, to inform me, he thought it proper I should send down the Books I had, belonging to the Library, which I had from him. I sent him word, I hoped I should spend my Christmas with him, then all the Books should be put in order; but this Affair happening, prevented my going, or sending the Books. There is something appears in my Behalf from the very Face of these Books. My Chambers were in the Corner of the first Court, and the Library in the Corner of the other great Court; I appeal to any Man, whether it was possible for any one to carry these great Books, (and some there are which are much bigger) out of the Library to my Chambers without Discovery; here are these Bibles, and Plutarch's Lives; the Thing speaks itself; 'tis impossible to remove these Books in a clandestine Manner. But, my Lord, I never was there, but the Boy, the Library-Keeper, was with me: He is a negligent Boy, and, I believe, 'tis no Wonder that Books should be lost from Trinity Library. When I was at College there was 15 or 1600 Books wanting, and must I be answerable for their Neglect, and be subject to Punishments and Indictments? I hope your Lordship does not think it necessary for me to call any Manner of Evidence; the Books are the Books of the Master, Fellows, and Scholars and I am a Scholar, consequently the Books I have a Right in, and they will be as much mine as theirs, therefore it cannot be Felony: If they have been carried away, it cannot be feloniously. I desire my Council may be heard. But it not being proved that Mr. Justice was a Member of the Corporation, his Objection was over ruled.
Justice. I would ask Mr. Professor Taylor if he did not give Directions to the Library-Keeper, that I should have what Books I wanted.

Taylor. Yes, I gave Orders that Mr. Justice should have what Books he had occasion for.
Justice. You are Greek Professor Sir, and was my Tutor: Is it not an usual Method for Tutors to give Orders, that their Pupils may have what Books they want?
Taylor. 'Tis not very common; but as Mr. Justice was a Gentleman, I indulged him.
Justice. I would know whether Fellow Commoners are not indulged with particular Privileges?
Taylor. We make some Distinction to be sure: They sit among Masters of Arts at Church, and in the publick Schools.
Justice. Don't they frequently attend the Schools?
Taylor. Yes.
Justice. What do you take a Scholar to be in Trinity College?
Taylor. They have about 14 l. a Year allowed them.
Q. Do you take Fellow Commoners to be Part of the Corporation?
Taylor. 'Tis taken in the College that they are not.
Justice. I desire to know if 'tis not taken in the College, that there are two sorts of Scholars, and the general Name for them is Scholaris, and that is, because they attend the Schools; don't Fellow Commoners attend the Schools?
Taylor. Yes, and take Degrees as others do.
Justice. There are Scholars in the College who have Pensions, and many others who have not: Well, Sir, I would know the Custom and Practice of the University: There is a Jurisdiction by some of the Charters, granted to the Chancellor, Master and Scholars.
Taylor. Yes, Sir.
Justice. If I had Money owing me, or owed Money, where must I sue, or where might I be sued?
Taylor. In the Vice-Chancellor's Court.
Justice. Why so?
Taylor. 'Tis always the Way.
Q. Suppose a Gentleman at Trinity is not matriculated, how is it then?
Justice. The very same Thing.
Taylor. This Question was never asked in any Suit in the University Courts, whether a Man was matriculated or not.
C. K. Your suing and being sued, is as you are a Member of the University, not as you are a Member of a College.
Justice. I apprehend what I am upon is material, because in all the Charters of Colleges, Scholars, as I am, are called Scholares, and the Stipendiary Scholars are called Discipuli. As the Distinction depends upon the Charter of the University, I would make use of the Words of the Charter, to describe the two sorts of Scholars. I would ask Mr. Taylor, is not a Fellow Commoner looked upon as a Member of a College?
Taylor. He is an admitted Member; I cannot say an incorporated one.
Justice. On the Admission of any one into the College, are there not Fees paid?
Taylor. Did not you pay those Fees?
Justice. I cannot tell: 'Tis not material, whether you or I paid them: But I would ask whether the Bed Makers have not Keys of our Chambers as well as we?
Taylor. Yes.
Justice. Then if I had stolen the Books, they would easily have been discovered. But did not you about November or December, send me word, you thought it proper I should return the Books I had taken?
Taylor. Yes, I said the Library was to be review'd, and it would be proper to replace the Books.
Justice. What Answer did I send you?
Taylor. You said you should come down at Christmas, and then the Books should be replaced.
Jury. We desire to know if there were any Books enter'd in the Library-Book to Mr. Justice on Mr. Taylor's Account?
Taylor. The last time he was at College there were some enter'd to him.
Jury. Were the Books now produced, or any of them enter'd?
Wilson. Not one of these were enter'd.
Justice. I hope the first thing we shall go upon, will be to see whether I am a Scholar or not.
Hutchinson. This is a Register of the Books lent out to the Fellows of Trinity. I am Head Library-Keeper, and keep the Book; it always lies in the Library, and I look into it every Day. There are some enter'd to Mr. Justice on Professor Taylor's Head, and made Return'd. Our Method is, when a borrow'd Book is return'd, the Under Library-Keeper gives a Stroke through the Name of the Book. Rhymer's Faedera, Vol. 1. Ashmole's Order of the Garter, are scratched out.
Justice. Mr. Taylor says, that Fellow Commoners are so far look'd on as Scholars, that they attend the publick Schools, come to Lectures, take Degrees, and therefore I am a Scholaris. I would ask him, whether for neglect of Duty they are not punished?
Taylor. Yes, as junior Fellows are.
Jury. I would ask Mr. Taylor, whether he apprehended he was regular in giving such Licence to Mr. Justice, as he says he did? and whether when he wrote the Letter to him, he apprehended he had more Books than were entered to his Name?
Taylor. I had no suspicion that he had, at that time.
C. K. Pray of whom does your Foundation consist? What do you call your selves?
Taylor. Master, Fellows and Scholars; a Fellow Commoner is not considered as a Fellow, nor as a Scholar.
C. K. Are Fellow Commoners and Scholars chose in election?
Taylor. Those that are Scholars in the House are chosen by Election; Fellow Commoners are not; they are examined, but not elected, nor are they considered as Scholars of the House. A Fellow Commoner may be chosen a Fellow, but he must be chosen a Foundation Scholar first.
C. K. Is there any Form of their Admittance?
Taylor. Yes, they write their own Names in a Register Book, and are sworn before the Vice-master
C. K. Are there any Advancements in the Colledge; to which if a Man be raised, it is necessary that he has been admitted a Scholar Can a Man be Master without he has been a Scholar?
Taylor. Yes; in such Cases the King nominates.
C. P. King Edward VI. gave them a Body of Statutes: and Queen Elizabeth gave them another, which are the Rule of Government; and on one of these Statutes, if I rightly understand, Mr. Justice depends. Here the Charter of the College was referred to, which incorporated them by the Names of Magister, Socii &c Scholares.
C. K. There is no Description in the Charter what a Scholar shall be. Henry VIII. when he gave this Charter reversed the Power to himself to give Statutes; but dying without giving them, Queen Elizabeth gave these, and there is a Distinction throughout between the Socii and Scholares.
Justice. In the 14th Chapter of Queen Elizabeth, you may observe the Stipendiary Scholar is called Discipulus, not Scholaris: Scholaris is another Word for Fellow. The Scholares & Socii are the constituent Parts of the Body. Common Pensioners are not elected, they take no Oath, therefore they cannot be on the Foundation. Commoners are part of the Foundation, the others are no part of the Foundation; if there be any Revenues to be divided they have no part of the Profit.
Here the Statutes were read concerning the Number of, and Distinction between, the Socii Scholares and the Discipuli Scholares.
C. P. I am far from saying that a Crime of this Nature is not punishable. I do not mean any such thing, nor advance any such Doctrine; but what I would insist upon, is, whether it is not a Larceny; punishable it is, but whether it is Felony is the Question.
Justice. I believe the University-Statutes may be given in Evidence, to shew the Meaning of the Word Scholaris. I apprehend it may be material to shew there are stipendiary Scholars, and Scholars of another kind.
(Read the Statutes.)
C. K. This does not shew that Fellow-Commoners are Members of the Corporation; here are Sociis Scholares and Discipuli Scholares, and these are all that are mentioned, and you don't pretend to be of the Discipuli Scholares.
There are to be 62 Discipuli Scholares, one of these you will not allow your self to be.
Justice. No, not a stipendiary Scholar, but a Scholar in general. I desire the Statutes of Edward VI. may be produced.
C. K. We had no notice of them. Here is the Charter of Henry VIII. and the Statutes of the College with relation to Fellow Commoners. There was a Dispute how far the Statutes of Edward VI. were in force; and they are now in the Bishop of Ely's Hands. He has the only authentick Copy of them; it was ordered by the Privy Council that they should be put in to his Hands.
Justice. I desire the 29th Chapter of Elizabeth may be read. Mr. Taylor gave a general Order for me to take what Books I had occasion for, and by Vertue of that Order, I took these; I ordered the Boy to set them to Mr. Taylor's Account; 'tis hardly possible I should take them secretly.
Taylor. I supposed they were to be regularly enter'd in my Name.
Justice. Call 
               
                  Robert 
                  Marsam 
               



            . (Who was sworn.)
Marsam. I liv'd with Mr. Justice as a Servant, about a quarter of a Year before he was taken up; he had many Books, I cannot swear to any in particular.

Justice. The Books always lay about in publick, openly, and my Study-Door always unlock'd; a Man that had stole them feloniously, would have been fitter for Bedlam than Newgate - (Weeps) Do not you remember (to Marsam) a great large Bible lying openly? Shew him the Book.
Marsam I can't say that ever I saw that Book.
Taylor. We found Newcastle's Horsemanship on the Floor in the Study, without its Binding, and the Study Door was lock'd.
Marsam. I can't say I saw that Book.
Justice. He is no Scholar, and so might not take notice of Latin and Greek Books. My Lord, I hope the Distinction as to the Scholares is plainly express'd by Queen Elizabeth's Statutes, and I hope it will be look'd upon, that Scholar is a Student, and every Student a Scholar.
The Council for the Prisoner very learnedly spoke to the Points in Debate, viz. Whether he was not to be considered as a Member of the Corporation. Whether a Member of a Corporation could be guilty of Felony in taking the Goods of that Corporation; and though the Prisoner should not be prov'd an integral or Foundation-Member; yet considering the Liberty or Indulgence granted him, whether it would not be too hard to construct his Crime into any Species of Felony. Their Arguments were severally and distinctly answered by the Council for the King, and the whole Evidence and the Substance of the Arguments on both sides being laid before the Jury in a very judicious and learned Charge, they withdrew, and in short time return'd, and found the Prisoner 

               guilty
            .
He was a second time 


               indicted for stealing a great Number of Books to a considerable value
            , being the Goods and Chattels of the 
               
                  Chancellor, Master, and Fellows of the University of Cambridge




            : To which he had pleaded not Guilty: But the Jury finding him guilty of the first Indictment, he desired leave to retract his Plea, and 


               pleaded guilty
            , and recommended himself to the Favour of the Court, and hoped for their Intercession to his Majesty for Mercy.
On Monday Evening the 10th of May, Mr. Justice was brought down from Newgate, to receive the Judgment of the Court; and being asked, what he had to say why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against him according to Law: His Answer was as follows:
Justice. My Lord, In my unhappy Situation, I have nothing left, but to plead the Benefit of the Statute, and pray the Favour of the Court, that I mny not be sent abroad, for the sake of the Prosecutors. My Lord, I was so far from denying that I had the Books, that I always ackowledged it; and I should be glad of an Opportunity of making them a farther Reparation, than they have at present. But if I am under a Necessity of going abroad, it will be absolutely impracticable. As therefore it will be more for their Interest than my own, I hope that will be considered. I speak not from any Desire I have to stay here; for I declare, that if I was to be discharged immediately, no one should see my Face more. (then wept) I own I took these Things, but with no Design to keep them: And I have many more belonging to them; which, if I must go abroad, they will never come at: Therefore, I hope, as the Law gives a discretionary Power to send abroad, or to punish at Home, by burning in the Hand, I hope for Punishment here, that I may be of Service to People with whom I have great Transactions. The Situation I have been in in Life, has occasioned my being intrusted with the Affairs of other People, and the Notice I have of my being to be sent away, is so short, 'tis impossible for me to settle them, or put them into any Method, whereby they may know what Course to take. I have also a young Family to take care of; and, I hope, for their Sake, as Justice has already had its course, and taken Place, your Lordship will think proper that Mercy should take its turn: And, indeed, it will be more Mercy to others, than myself. I have the Honour to be acquainted with many Gentlemen of the same Honourable Profession; I am not unknown to your Lordship; but this fatal Error has been a terrible one to me, and the Consequences of it will always lie upon me; and has deprived me of the Profits and Satisfaction I had Reason to hope for from an Honourable Employment. Instead of being punished, by being sent abroad I beg for Punishment here, for the first Reason assigned; viz. that I may have it in my Power to make Reparation to the People injur'd. I never deny'd the Books; always acknowledged them, and took them with an honest Intent; yet, I have been obliged to remove a great many: I ow'd Rent to my Landlord, and was under a Necessity to send them into the Country, and afterwards to Holland; If I am sent away, they can never come by their own, therefore I hope they will not be averse to what I offer. I have not much more to offer: But as I have the Honour to be known to some Gentlemen on the Bench, I should be glad to have the Favour of the Court, that I may be useful to the People I have injur'd.
My Lord, there is one thing which bore pretty hard upon me at my Trial, and which I mention now, not to extenuate my Guilt, but for the Preservation of those who otherwise may fall into my unhappy Condition: In Relation to the Bibles and Newcastle's Horsemanship, I solemnly declare, that I did charge the Librarian to put them to my Account. If a Man goes and takes a Book according to the Rules of the College, and orders the Book to be set down, if it should be neglected, no Gentleman can be safe: I mention this that they may take more Care, and that Accidents of this kind may be prevented for the future. I am now going to suffer the Law, and the Sentence to be pronounced. The Act gives a discretionary Power to the Court, and if they think fit, the Offender may be burnt in the Hand: But whether the Court will use that discretionary Power with Mercy to me, I know not.
For my own Part, I had now rather go abroad, than stay at home; but there are some Reasons which make it better for me to stay at home. I have been confined half a Year already, and I don't know whether I shall have Opportunity to make Application for Mercy, or to make any Discoveries before the Transports go.
Then the Sentence of 


               Transportation
             was pronounced.
On Tuesday, May 11. Mr. Justice mov'd by his Council, that he might be allow'd to transport himself, or that a worthy Gentleman of the City of York might contract for him; but the Court would not grant him such Liberty.

His Sister liv'd up Stairs in the same House, and upon my talking to him, he was just going to confess, but she cry'd out upon the Stairs to him, you Blood of a Bitch, what are you going to do! come up Stairs! I took him up the next Day, and he confessed he broke the Window, and got in and took the Things mention'd. I never found my Things, for he said he had given them to his Sister, and what she had done with them he knew not.

            . The Prisoner became my Journeyman
 in January last; since which he has robb'd me of the Things mentioned in the Indictment. Cousens had carried two Pieces of my Goods to pawn; and when she went with the third, the Pawnbroker suspecting she had stole them, stopt her, and made her give an Account, how she came by them. Mr. Page, the Pawnbroker, brought her to my House, and she confess'd she had the Goods of Baxter; that she pawn'd them for him, and that she gave him the Money they were pawn'd for.

            . The Prisoner Cousens brought three pieces of Shagreen to me; I lent her Money upon two; the first piece was brought the 5th of May, the 2d, the 14th, and the 20th, she came again with another, I then ask'd whose they were; she said a Person near St. Clement's Church, and desired me, if I did not care to lend Money upon it, to let her have the Goods again. I insisted upon her going with me to the Person she had them of, and as we were going along, she said she had them of one Baxter, a Servant, and wanted to go to an Ale-house and send for him; but I would not suffer that, but made her go to the House. I called for the Master of the Shop, and asked him if he had not a Servant whose Name was Baxter, and I discovered the Affair to him. Baxter immediately begg'd for Mercy, and that we would not charge a Constable with him; he own'd he would make his Master Satisfaction.

            . I am a Constable. Mr. Salt sent for me the 20th of May: Baxter own'd the taking the Goods, and she own'd her receiving them knowing how he came by them: He fell upon his Knees and own'd both in the Shop and in the Garden that he gave Cousens the Goods, and wish'd his Arms might rot off his Body if ever he had wrong'd his Master of any Thing else; but next Day we found several Things at the Woman's Lodging, and all the rest we found at Pawnbrokers. All that she said by way of excuse, was, that she was very sorry she was brought into this Scrape. She went for his Wife, and he kept her in Lodgings. Baxter

In January last the Prisoners and I got into the Water house: Thomas Smith made the Picklock Keys in his Cellar with which Baily open'd the Door; we took about 1/2 hundred of Lead, and Tom Smith sold it at the End of Lombard-court near the seven Dials at 9 s. 4 d. per hundred, and we all shared the Money. About 7 or 8 Days afterwards, we enter'd again and got as much again, as we did the first Time; and this we sold in Dyott-street for 11 s. per hundred. We shar'd the Money at the Cock Alehouse, and drank two pots of Beer. And the latter end of January, we went again and got the Spindle of a Brass-Cock, and sold it to one Green. Tom Smith told us, we might rob there these seven Years and not be found out.

Def. I did go into this Man's Shop for Bacon, and as I stood by the Counter, says he, Mistress are not you with Child? Yes Sir, says I Why then if you will let me feel your great Belly, I'll give you a Groaning Cheese. I had 3 Children, and going to lye down again, and I thought God would forgive me if I let him, and I let him do it; but after that he required farther Favours, which I would not grant him. Customers coming into the Shop, I went away with my Cheese, and I had got but a little Way before he came after me and charged me with stealing it, when I knew I had not stole it.

I served her, and the Minute she was gone, I missed the Ribbon. My fellow Servant ran after her, and brought her back, we searched her; but found nothing upon her.

My fellow Servant and I had counted the Ribbons over a little before she came into the Shop; the former Witness served her, and the Minute she was gone, he told me, he missed a piece of Ribbon, green Saxe Gotha; and I am positive it was in the Drawer just before. I pursued her, and took her in the Little Minories Gate way, and brought her back; then we got a Constable and carry'd her before a Justice, and at the Bull Head in Bread street, she said, if my Master would be favourable, she would tell us where the Ribbon was, and according to her Directions, we found it hid behind some Shutters, which stand under that Gate-way. I pushed the Shutters, and the Ribbon fell down.

Adderson. I had the Misfortune to be confined in the Fleet 22 Weeks, and was discharged 3 Weeks ago this very Night. I entrusted this Woman to lye with my Daughter, thinking her to be an honest Woman; but when I came home, I found all my Things gone: I knew she was absconded before I came out of the Fleet, and have never seen her 'till she was taken up. Several of my Things I found at 
               
                  John 
                  Dorman

                  Glover 
               



            's, two Pawn-brokers, who are here in Court, and can swear they were in my House, when she came there.


                  John 
                  Dorman 
               



            . The Prisoner used to bring things to pawn, and fetched them out again; I thought she had been entrusted by Adderson with the things, and that it could not be a Felony. She pawned them with me in her own Name; here's a List of them. April 12, an Apron for 1 s. April 22, a Cap for 1 s. May 24, an Apron for 1 s. March 4, a Cloak for 4 s. April 16, an Apron for 1 s. The 17th or 18th of May, a Suit of Pinners for half a Crown. February 7, an Apron half a Crown. May 19, a Cap 4 d. May 15, a Petticoat 8 d. May 1, a Handkerchief 8 d. April 28, five Napkins 3 s. May 12, a Handkerchief 6 d. May 13, a piece of Stuff 4 d. The same Day a Mob 8 d. May 5, a pair of Stays 9 s. May 20, a Petticoat 7 s. 6 d. May 24, a Quilt 14 s. 9 d. and with this 14 s. 9 d. she redeemed two Spoons of Mrs. Adderson's; so by that I took it she was entrusted with them.
Q. Did you entrust the Prisoner to pawn Goods for you?
Adderson. No.
Q. Did you commit these Goods to her Custody?
Adderson. No.
Q. Then the Pawn-broker is mistaken in his Law. You ought not to have received these Goods, without knowing what Authority she had to pawn them, and you are very faulty in taking them in.
Dorman. Here are other Things in the List of Mrs. Addersons, which the Prisoner brought to our House. She always pawn'd them in her own Name; and when I asked her any Questions, she always said she was sent.
Q. If you thought she was sent, why did you take them in her Name?


                  John 
                  Glover 
               



            , I took from the Prisoner a check'd Apron for 18 d. a short silk Apron for 9 d. and a Remnant of new Stuff for 1 s. a Breadth and a half of Muslin for 1 s. She said she brought them from one 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Cox 
               



            , but she laid them in her own name.
Q. You that receive Goods in pawn ought to be very cautious: You are Nurseries of Thieves, and they would have no vent for stollen Goods, if you did not receive them in pawn. Half the Felonies committed in Town, are owing to this Encouragement.

John Donnel. The 26th of June, the Watch was stole on board a Ship (The Willing Mind)


 riding off the Armitage. I was just got out of Bed to roll some Goods out of the Hold; and while I was in the Hold, he stole the Watch out of my Breeches which lay on a Chair in the Cabbin. I advertised it, and the Watchmaker he had sold it to, brought me the Watch again. I took the Prisoner before Justice Farmer, and he confessed the Fact, and signed his Examination.

The said Cisti being charged before me, by

             stole out of the Cabbin in the said Sloop a Watch, value 40 s. the Property of John Donnel; he confesseth and saith, on the 26th of June he took the said Watch, and sold it to one Major Woolhead in Leadenhall street for 42 s. and farther saith not.

            . I had the Misfortune to buy this Watch of the Prisoner, three or four Days afterwards I saw the Advertisement: it did not come up fully to the Description in the Advertisement, for the Maker's Name is advertised (W A Y) and the Name on the Watch is WISE; however I immediately carried it to the Prosecutor, who own'd it; the Prisoner was taken up, and carried before Justice Farmer, where I saw him sign his Confession.

            , June 9
.
John Vere. On Wednesday Night, the 9th of June, my House was broke open, and I lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment; there is an empty House joining to mine. and in my Kitchen on the Ground Floor, is a Window which serves my House and that. In the Morning  we found the Lead of that Window Part of the Window taken off: the Sink where I wash myself every if it had been broken befoe, 'tis impossible and the whole family must have seen it I cannot swear the Prisoner committed the Fact;  but I was present at his Examination the Justice, and I swore to a back Waiste at, which he had on his Back, when he was apprehended.

            . The Prisoner lives in Bel-yard: I know him very well; and I saw him or such a one, come out of the empty House early that Morning.

                  Elis 
               



            . I am acquainted with the Prisoner: On the 12th of June about 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon, I met the Prisoner on Clerkenwell-green; he asked me to go and drink with him: we went to an Alehouse, and he told me he wanted Money, and desired me to pawn a Shirt for him: I took it and carried it to Mr. Parsons, he told me, he had bought it.

                  Ellis 
               



             brought the Shirt to pawn and was stopped with it; I was sent to take the Prisoner: This is the Shirt which was stopped, and Mr. Vere's Maid, swore to the Shirt he had on his Back: It has been in my Custody ever since. I did not see them take it off, but the Justice's Clerk delivered them to me in the Office.

            . These are my Master's Shirts: I made them, and am positive to them: Eight of these Shirts which I had put into the Drawer on Wednesday Night were lost; and the Window I know was safe that Night between 11 and 12.

            . I saw the Waistcoat and Shirt taken off his Back at the Justice's, and delivered to the Constable; and the Buckles taken out of his Shoes, and the Knee-buckles out of his Breeches. He begged very hard for one of the Shirts to go to Jail in.
Mr. Gravener swore to his Goods mentioned in the Indictment, and produced a pair of Pincers which were found on the Ledge of the Window, with which he supposed the Lead was untwisted.

Defence. I found these Things in Chancery Lane: I suppose the Person that robbed the House dropped them.

            . I know nothing of the Prisoners. In January my House was robbed; I was up my self 'till 11 o'Clock, and left my House safe when I went to bed; in the Morning, a Shutter was taken off, and the Sash which was nailed down, was forced up. I lost 3 Pots, 6 Copper Sauce-pans, 3 Pewter Dishes, a Velvet Cap, and a Peruke.

            . I made my self a voluntary Evidence against the Prisoners, intending to go to Sea, and get away from them. A pretty while after Christmas, Pritchard asked me to take a walk with him, and he and I, and Morris went to Hoxton, about 12 o'Clock at noon; we viewed Allen's House, and Pritchard said, this is a proper House, we can get in here. Then we went to the Farthing Pye-house, and drank two Full Pots; about 11 o'Clock at night we went to Allen's again, and staid about the House 'till 12. We found the Doors lock'd and fast, but with a ripping Chissel and a Knife, I made way to open the Pin of the Window; then we wrenched the Shutter down, and finding the Sashes nailed, I forced one of them up my self. Then says Pritchard, D - n me, who will go in; one was afraid, and t'other was afraid; keep a good look out, says I, and I will go in: They said, if any body came by, they would cry, Hyp. I got in, and unbolted the Door, then I handed out three Porridge Pots, one of them had three Feet on the bottom; six Sauce-pans, they were Copper, I believe, and as soon as we had got them, we carried them to the Prisoner Eades, three Pewter Dishes, a Velvet Cap, and a Natural Wig; we put them into a Flower-bag, and thinking we heard a Noise, we got out, and went off. I put the Cap and Wig in my Pocket; Pritchard and Morris put the rest of the Things into the Bag, as I handed them out. Then we made the best of our way, and took spell and spell, turn and turn to carry them to Rag-Fair, and we got there between two and three; from thence we went to Salt-Peter Bank, to a Glass-house, which is tumbled down, and we hid the Things under the Rubbish, and stow'd Bricks upon them. Happening to see 
               
                  Mary 
                  Eades 
               



             there, (for 'tis a common Place for such People) she told us, she knew a Place where they bought such Things. I asked her, if she would sell them for us, and told her, we had stole them; she said, she knew a Case, where she could dispose of such Things; so I gave her the three Porridge-pots, and the six Sauce-pans, to another Woman who was with her. They went away together, and came back for the Dishes; we gave them the Dishes directly, and then they went away, and brought us 25 s. G - d d - m your Blood, you B - ch, says, Pritchard to Eades, have you brought us no more? she said, no, she could not get any more. About two o'Clock that Afternoon, I sold the Wig, and the Cap for half a Crown each, which made just 30 s. together, and Eades had 4 s. for her Trouble; 2 s. we spent upon her, and divided 8 s. a piece. The 2 s. we spent at an Irish Man's at Salt-Peter Bank, at the Sign of the Hoop: After this, I did not see them for a matter of four Months.

            , Can you say I received the 4 s. from you?
Shaw. She kept 4 s. out of the Money. She said, she had sold the Pots to one in Bishop's Gate street; I sent Word to the Prosecutor, but there was no such Person to be found.
Eades. Who was the other Woman that was with me?
Shaw. Phoenix, was with you.

            . I was at Justice Farmer's to have a Warrant discharged; and while I was there, Shaw came voluntarily, and made this Information: I staid while he made it, and by his Direction we took the three Prisoners.
Morris. I can prove where I was when the Robbery was done.
Pritchard. I am as innocent as the Child in its Mother's Womb.
Eades. Shaw quarrelled with me about fetching a Hat out of pawn, and because I would not, he has made himself a Puff. I was drinking a Dram, and he came with these Gentlemen, and said, these are your Prisoners; I said, Daniel, you know Phaenix has got the Hat: I shewed her where to pawn it; and he gave me a Quartern of Gin, and told me he stole it from a Man, in the first Field in Stepney.

Edward Eavley. I was coming from Black-Fryers about 1 o'Clock in the Morning, August the 16th, and I saw 
               
                  Alice 
                  King 
               



             in Ludgate-Street; I asked her the way to Cheapside: She said if I would give her a Dram she would show me. We went to a House in Black and White-Court, in the Old-Baily


, and she call'd for a Dram and bid me pay for it, it comes to 6 d. said she: I gave her a Shilling, and desir'd her to return me 6 d. but she would not: I made words about my 6 d. and presently the other 5 Women came about me, and I felt one of their Hands in my Pocket; Don't pick my Pocket says I; no, no, say'd they; but Susan Anthill, by Violence took the Watch out of my Pocket, and ran down half the Stairs, and jump'd the rest; I ran after her a little way and came back to the House, but I was obliged to cry out Murder before I could get out of it again, for all the Women were about me at once; One had her Hands about my Wast; another unty'd, and pull'd off my Apron, for I am a Porter
.
Q. And did not you Porter do very wisely to go along with these Women?


                  Alice 
                  Bunningham 
               



            . I was Servant in the House.
Q. And which of your Mistresses did this Man charge with stealing his Watch?
Bunningham. Susan Anthill ran down some of the Stairs, and jump'd all the rest, and out of Doors she went directly; but the next Day she told me, she had got the Porter's Watch, and that she had pawn'd it, but did not tell me where.
Prisoner Anthill. I was coming from the Bar that night, at half an Hour past 12, and I met this Woman and that young Woman, and I desired them to go make haste home and take care of my House: When I came home, I found my Door broke, my Maid drunk, and found that a Watch had been lost in my House. The Man told my Maid, he would give her a New Gown if she would swear against me, to transport me.
Q. How come you to have this Maid for your Evidence?
Eavley. This Man (the Beadle) will tell you.
Prisoner Anthill. This Man has had many a Shilling of mine.
Beadle. The Watchman at 2 o'Clock told me there had been a great Hubbub at Anthill's, I said 'twas a very disorderly House, and going down, we met Anthill. I told her if she suffer'd such doings at her House, she would soon he routed away. 'Tis my impudent Maid, says she, that is the Occasion of this; I am going home. When we came down, we found the Man stamping and making a Noise for his Watch; and before we were admitted, the Man cry'd out Murder: We made them open the Door, and he charged 4 Women with robbing him (Anthill was not then in the House:) We carry'd them to the Compter, and the next Morning before Sir

            , in the House of Benjamin Baddily, Nov. 7
.
Benjamin Baddily. The Prisoner came to me as a Servant
, September 22, and was turn'd away Nov. 8. After she was discharged, this Parcel of Cambrick was found conceal'd in her Bed; another Servant found it, and brought it to me. I examined the Stock in my Shop, and found I had lost Cambrick, but I cannot swear to this, because she has destroy'd the Mark. The Fan belongs to a Lady who came to my House on Lord-Mayor's Day to see the Show; 'tis a very particular Thing, and I took particular Notice of it, and swear 'tis the same. The Day after she was discharged, I went in pursuit of her, and found her; I tax'd her with the Goods, and she confess'd she stole the Cambrick while the Family was at Church, and that the Fan was at one Mary Brand's House; she took it off the Table in the Dining-Room; she own'd she took the Fan, the Cambrick, and this Apron. I did promise, (in order to bring her to a Confession) that I would be as favourable to her as I could; but I did not promise her that I would not prosecute her.


                  Mary 
                  Brand 
               



            . A Day or two after my Lord-Mayor's Day, the Prisoner brought this Fan to me, to keep for her; she told me that she found it; but when she came so suddenly from her Place, I delivered it to her again; she did not care to take it, and desired I would burn it; I refus'd, and her Master taxing her with it, she return'd it to him.



                  Ann 
                  Weston 
               



            . I live with my Brother Baddily; we had a Suspicion that she was not honest, therefore she was turn'd away. The Cambrick being found in the Bed where the Prisoner lay, I went immediately to look over my Things, and miss'd an Apron and a Cap: The Apron she brought again, and confess'd to me that she took it; but as the Mark is taken out, I will not take upon me to swear 'tis the same I lost.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Callowell 
               



            . I was the Prisoner's fellow Servant; she desired me, just before she went away, to look in her Bed for some Cambrick which she had bought to make Handkerchiefs, and begg'd I would convey it to her unknown to my Master. I found it, and it was shew'd to my Master.
Mr. Baddily. This is the Cambrick which she confess'd she took from me.
Callowell. She confess'd the same in my hearing.


                  Ann 
                  Abbot 
               



            . I live with Miss Andrews, and was with her at Mr. Baddily's on Lord-Mayor's Day: My Lady had this Fan with her there; but at Night it was missing, and could not be found.
Prisoner. I know nothing of the Things they charge me with; the Fan indeed I found next Morning in the Dining-Room, and gave it to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brand

.
Mrs. Goddard I lost a Piece of stripp'd Cotton, and a Piece of Check, Oct. 7, the Value of them is about 4 s
- Cook. About two Months ago (I can't remember the Day) we robb'd the Prosecutor's Shop in Moor-Street, by St. Ann's





. The three Prisoners and I had attempted it several times; but at last we found an Opportunity to do it; for about Seven or Eight o'Clock at Night I lifted up the Sash and took out the Check. I was not content with that, so we all return'd and fetch'd twenty Yards of Cotton. We carry'd it to
                Ann Hill
            's House; she pawn'd it for 21 s. and we equally shar'd the Money in her Room. This David Brown, lost his Great Coat, we stole it: Pell was taken up about it, and I was catch'd in the very Coat my self.

I was inform'd by a Lad that Pell and this Evidence had been lurking about the Coach, so I pursued them and took Pell, and about a Week afterwards Cook was taken, and he made himself an Evidence and discover'd this Robbery.

            . I live in Brook-street, Grosvenor-Square





; on Monday the 9th of August about nine at Night, I was at Supper in a Ground Room, and all of a sudden I saw the Window Curtain and a Silver Cup which stood in the Window was gone; I run out, but could hear no Tidings of it, only we found a little old Hat, which the Evidence Cook said was his.
Cook. Pell and 
               
                  John 
                  Lowder 
               



             and I, committed this Robbery; I saw the Sash a little open, and some Body in the Room, but seeing the Cup in the Window I ran to the Prisoners, and told them there was something we must have; so I push'd the Sash up a little higher, and watch'd till the Maid was gone out of the Room; then I snatch'd up the Cup, and away I ran with it. We sold it to Ann Field who lives by Hicks's-Hall





, and she knew it to be stole. We asked her two Guineas for it, but she said she would give but one for it, because it would cost her something to melt it down, and she should have a good deal of Trouble to make away with it. I gave a Man that us'd to deal with her in this Way, Half a Crown to shew me where she liv'd. I had been at 
               
                  Bess 
                  Anderson 
               



            's who buys our Handkerchiefs, to know where I should sell this Cup, and this Man happening to be there, he carried me to the Prisoner Field's, she would not weigh it, because she would not give too much Money for it.
Dickins. I had a Direction from Cook, where this Woman liv'd; so I took two Friends, one of them is a Constable, and we went in and called for a Pint of Beer (she keeps a Publick House
) then we asked for the Mistress of the House; she came to us, and we enquir'd if her Name was not Field. Yes, said she. Then said I to the Constable, here's your Prisoner. Oh! but, said she, my Name is not Field, my Name is Pritchard, and she called several People and asked them if her Name was not Pritchard, and they all said yes. She told us then she knew where this Field liv'd, and would go and fetch her; so she turn'd herself round and away she ran, and we lost her, though one Man stood at one End of the Court, and another at the other, to prevent her escaping; this was on Friday, and she was not seen 'till 11 or 12 o'Clock on Sunday Night. A Person I had employ'd to watch, sent me Word he had heard a Noise in the House, so I got a Constable about one o'Clock, and found her packing up all her Goods in order to be gone.
Field. Field is none of my Name, and as for that Fellow, I never saw him in my Life. Cook the Evidence came to my House, and ask'd for 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones 
               



            , and the Woman and he went into a Room together, and they had a Quartern of Brandy and a Pint of Beer together.

               receiving a Gown, a Cloak and other Things, knowing them to be stole
            .
Sarah Smith I was in our Cart almost asleep; and I heard some body ask the Man that drove it, where his Master and Mistress was: They had no sooner spoke, but they pull'd the Tilt off the Cart, and said, Money they wanted, and Money they must have: My Husband said, Gentlemen, I am a poor Man; but they clapp'd a Pistol to his Head, and pull'd of my Pocket in the Cart; what Money I had, I hit down in the bottom of the Cart, but they pick'd it up; I can't swear how much it was. Then they pull'd me out of the Cart, and carry'd me into a Field, and stripped me of my Gown, three Cloaks, one of them was my Maid's ( Eunace Newman) a linnen Apron, a Handkerchief and they took my Shoes off my Feet. I cannot swear to any of the Prisoners, for they all the Time endeavoured to hide my Face, that I might not for them. I saw one of them abuse my Husband, but I cannot swear to him.


                  Francis 
                  Smith 
               



            . We were going Home with our Cart, and four Men assaulted us; two of them got up into the Cart and robb'd us: I remember one of them, I believe, but I don't care to swear positively; one of them had a red Coat on.
Q. Was either of the Prisoners there?
Francis Smith. Yes, Ryan stood on the off Side of the Cart, and gave me several knocks as I was in it. One had a red Coat, but I can't swear to him. Ryan cry'd d - n you come down, and gave me several Blows. They took all the Money I had from me, I can't say how much that was.
Ryan. What is the meaning that you can swear to one, and not to another? - Hah! How many of us were in Company?
F. Smith. There were four of you in all.
Ryan. And pray which of the four do you know?
F. Smith. You in particular.
Ryan. With humble Submission my Lord, why should he know me in particular?
F. Smith. Because you gave me a great many ugly Knocks.
Ryan. With humble Submission my Lord, I can't tell why he should have any Notice of me.
F. Smith. Why you damn'd me, and bid me turn about, and it was you that pull'd my great Coat over my Back.
Ryan. And will you swear it?
F. Smith. Yes, I do.
Ryan. With humble Submission my Lord, inform your self about that Fellow.
F. Smith. They took nothing but our Money from us in the Cart, but they made us go into the Field, and they took my Great Coat, and my Wife's Cloaths from her in the Field, after they had plunder'd the Cart.
Ryan. Well, I suppose you know who they were.
F. Smith. I can't swear that the same Man that robb'd the Cart stripp'd us in the Field; but I can with a safe Conscience swear that Ryan was among them in the Field; they d - 'd us when they drove us up the Field and bid us go faster.
Ryan. I have no Business to ask him any Questions.
F. Smith. My great Coat was brought me from Justice De Veil's, and the Cloak which was brought from thence, my Maid will swear to.
Ryan. My Lord with humble Submission, what's the Reason he should know particular Marks of me, before three more? with humble Submission my Lord, why does he know me?
F. Smith. I know you by your Voice, your Nose, your black Hair, by your laying so violently upon me (for I was cover'd all over with Blood) I know you by your Boldness, and your strutting Manner.
Ryan. My Lord, with humble Submission, that Fellow will swear that a Cow is a Jack-ass. With humble Submission, you must understand the Evidence; I don't know what they are, not I, the Thief-takers instruct them for the sake of the Reward, - and that's every Thing.
F. Smith. He clapp'd a Pistol to my Head in the Field, and bid me lye down; then they bound us; they ty'd my Hands behind me with a strong penny Cord, and my Legs they fasten'd up to my Hands. Before they bound me, they pull'd off my Coat and Waistcoat and Shoes. I don't know the Day of the Month this was done, but my Wife does.
S. Smith. 'Twas the 8th of this last December.

Q Would you ask the Witnesses any Questions?
Ryan. With humble Submission, he swears so much, that I don't know what to ask him.

            . One of them jump'd out of a Ditch and stopp'd the Cart; they turn'd the Fore-horse, and swore if I stirr'd they would shoot me as I sat on the Copses of the Cart. 'Twas that Man (Ryan) that turn'd the Horse.
Ryan. With humble Submission, inform your self what this Fellow has sworn, - and these Evidences.
Nash. I swear you abus'd my Master, and pull'd his coat off, and he, hope (help'd) to pull it off. I lost 22 d. in Money, and my Hat and my Knife. There was four of them, and they all jump'd out of the Ditch upon me.
Ryan. You swore before Justice De Viel, that I was the first Man that knock'd you down.

             and I, met this same Man in the High Road, between Tottenham



 and the quarter House, in Hampstead Road



: we stopp'd his Cart, and got the Man down, and took a Shilling and some Brass, about 16 d. in all from him, as far as I can understand, that same Hugh Macmahon, and John Macdonald went into the Cloth that cover'd the Cart, stripp'd it off, and took a Pocket from the Woman; then they made the Man and the Woman come out of the Cart, they took the Man's Coat, and the Woman's Pocket; I can't justly tell whether they took any Cloaths from the Woman 'till they came to the Field; but there they took her Handkerchief, her Cloak, her Gown, her Apron, and her Shoes.

            , that goes under the Name of Ryan's Wife. That very same Night I came into Ryan's Room, and he delivered the Cloth Coat to her to pawn; and the Gown he gave to her, I cannot justly say whether I told her the Things were stole or not.
Q. Was you there when the Things were deliver'd to Coleman?
O'Bryan. Yes, my Lord, and the same Time we all went to one Lacey's House to drink. Coleman knew it was on the same subject it was, - when she receiv'd the Things, and she knew we could come by them no other Way but by robbing on the High-way.
Macmahon. Please your Lordship, ask how long he has known me in this Country?
O'Bryan. About Three Months before he was taken up.
Macmahon. Very well: where, (with Submission) did you know me first?
O'Bryan. Not in Ireland, but in France. I became acquainted with you in this Country at London: the first Time I saw you was at Ryan's Room.
Macmahon. Very well, please the Honourable Court, he lodged over against my Room in Newtoner's-Lane; and the first Time I ever saw him was at Gravesend. The whole Court and your Lordship will all know by and by, that I will prove this Man to be a Perjury [perjur'd] before the whole Court. On what Occasion did I become acquainted with you?
O'Bryan. I was at Ryan's Room, on the same Intention, to go a robbing on the Highway.
Macmahon. Did I ask you, or did you ask me?
Ryan. My Lord, with humble Submission, - he is very capable of swearing, - pray how long have you known me?
O'Bryan. I knew Ryan in the same Regiment that I was in, about four Years ago, and about three Quarters of a Year ago, he went to get Recruits for the same Regiment. He was in Garrison with me in the French King's Service at St. Omers.
Ryan. With humble Submission, my Lord, how came he to have Access to my Room, - out and in, above any other?

                  Coleman 
               



             for receiving stolen Goods. Ryan was taken in Rag-Fair, in Company with others, upon him we found a Handkerchief, ('twas here produced) 'twas taken from him at Colonel Williamson's: I can't swear positively this is the very same which was then taken from him; because it was left in the Colonel's Custody all Night, but 'tis like it, and if it is the same there is the Colonel's Seal upon it.
S. Smith. This very Handkerchief they took off my Neck in the Field.
Griffith. It was left with Colonel Williamson, who is Governor of the Tower all Night, and I received it from him seal'd.
Col. Williamson. This Handkerchief was taken from Ryan in my Presence, and these Buckles were taken out of his Shoes; this Hat was took from him too, in my Presence. I lock'd them up in my Scrutore all Night, then I seal'd them, and deliver'd them to the Constable.
Griffith. After the Governor had committed Ryan to Newgate, I took Coleman in Custody on a different Warrant for receiving Goods stolen; so we brought her to the Round House to be examin'd. Next Day when we came to Newgate, Colonel Deacon inform'd us, that the Cloak on Coleman's Back was the same that was taken from Smith; accordingly I went to the Round House and took it from her, and here it is.
Eunace Newman. This is my Cloak, the same I lent my Mistress.
Ryan's Defence. With humble Submission, my Lord, 'tis all false that they have sworn about the Handkerchief and the Hat, and the Governor of the Tower. Inform your self how she lost them, and who took them from her.
C. Why she says you took them from her.
Ryan. 'Tis a cursed Lie, with humble Submission; my Moan is, - shall this Woman here, (meaning Coleman) answer for this? I tell you, - I don't deny but I have been a Transgressor, but that's no Reason an innocent Person should lose her Life by the Liar and the Perjuror. I don't deny but I have been a Transgressor, and by the Grace of God I shall suffer.
Macmahon's Defence. When I came over from France, and got to Gravesend, I met this O'Bryan, he had Six Men with him, which he was carrying into the French Service. This was Two Days before Allhallontide, he went on toward France, and I came to London, with two young Fellows in my Company. There is one Garvey can justify that he lent half a Guinea in France or Flanders, about 14 or 15 Days after I parted with him, yet the Man swears I did these Things. Lord! see what difference there is in the Man's Talk. The Woman he lent the Money too, keeps the Horse-shoe and Magpye in Drury-Lane. I hope you'll look into his Manners, - why, and how he is striving to take my Life away, because I have no Friends to stand by me.

                  Coleman 
               



            . Ask him how he came acquainted with me.
O'Bryan. I became acquainted with her in Flanders.
Coleman. Examine him over again, my Lord, pray examine him over again. I am a poor Woman, and have serv'd the Counsellors in Lincolns-Inn and Chancery-Lane, and several of the Council now in the Court with Flowers very honestly.
Ryan. What she has done was by my Order, I am her Husband: I don't know any Robbery she has committed.

The Rogues when they had got into my Yard, took out some Glass from a Window near the Door, and I suppose they put their Hands in and unbolted the upper Bolt, and the bottom Bolt they wrenched off, and the Batten of the Door likewise. They took the Things mention'd in the Indictment. We found 5 of my Plates that very Night in Bullock's-Court, which is next my House, and the Prisoner was taken the same Time.

We left our Candles and Lanthorns at the Watch-house, and waited at the Place where the Pales were broke, in about an Hour the Prisoner came to the very Place, and we took him. He was carry'd to the Counter that Night, and next Morning we had him before Sir

James Bannister. About 5 Weeks ago, I went to Worthington's (this old Woman's) House to enquire for Mr. Hinton a Printer; I waited for him till 11 at Night, then I fell asleep; the old Woman asked me to go to Bed; I did, and in the Morning, when I got up, all my Money was gone. I told my Landlady I had been robb'd, - Lord, says she, I have kept House 40 Years and never any such Thing happen'd before. She told me, she had let the Prisoner in about 12 o'Clock, and she would examine her. While I was contesting with the old Woman, the Prisoner came in very drunk, but we got her to sleep, and she awaked and was come to herself, she told us she had the Money, and that she took it for Funn, but if I would be good natur'd I should have some of it again. I pallaver'd with her, and at last she said the Money was in the Hands of St. James's Watch-house Keeper, so she and I went to him; he asked me who I was? With a very reverend Bow, - I said, - with Submission, you have Money of mine in your Hands; he deny'd it, and order'd me to be put out of the Watchhouse: Well says I to the Prisoner, you said you took it for Funn, you shall go along with me for Funn, and so I pull'd her away with me, and got a Constable; he search'd her and found the Purse upon her. She told Justice Lambert that I gave it her, but in the Round-house she said that Col. Turner gave it her.
Prisoner. Ask him what Woman that was that was a Bed with him at my Landlady's? I am an unhappy Woman 'tis true, but I never pick'd a Pocket in my Life.

            . The Prosecutor came in that Night and asked for Mr. Hinton, he was not at Home, so he sat down to wait his coming in, and falling asleep I asked him to go Bed, and he did so. This Prisoner was foul, and she was with me upon Cure; I take in sick People; the Woman to be sure is a vile Creature in her Way, - when she was well, could not she have made use of her own Way of Living again, without robbing the Man? She came Home fuddled two Hours after he was gone to bed, and there being never a Lock upon the Prosecutor's Door, and her Chamber being upon the same Floor with his, I charged her to go up softly. In the Morning he told me he was robbed, I bid him make himself easy, I should hear of it again; while he was disputing with me, in comes Madam with a Man with her; we taxed her with the Money, and under Pretence of helping us to it again, she led us from Bagnio to Bagnio, the Lord knows where; she was in Liquor indeed, but we brought her Home and made her lye down, and when she awaked, I said, how could you do such a Thing in my House, - I that have done you such Service in curing you and making you right again! Why, says she, I did it for Funn, and if he'll be very civil I'll get him two Guineas and a Half again, but if he is saucy he shall have none. About five or six o'Clock we went to the Watchman at St. James's that had the Money; he turned us out of the Watch-house, but the Prosecutor got hold of the Prisoner and pulled her out, she took hold of me, and so I was tumbled into the Kennel among them, but I got out again like a Cat; then we got a Constable and searched the Prisoner, and found the Bag upon her, and then we returned to the Watch-house Keeper, and he owned he had received five Guineas and a Half from the Prisoner, which he gave us back again.
Prisoner. Pray ask him whether the Money that Wingfield the Beadle returned him, - whether the Prosecutor did not give it me, - and ask him for what?
Bannister. I never saw her till after my Money was gone.

             (that is one of the Prisoner's Names) was not come in We went to bed, and in the Morning the Man said he was robbed, and that he had lost 8 Guineas and some Silver. The Prisoner came in soon after very much fuddled, and she said she took his Money for Funn, and if he'd be civil, perhaps she'd give him a couple of Guineas again.
Prisoner. Ask the Witness how she came acquainted with that Man - She's a very disorderly Woman.
Hinton. I knew him when he drove the Stage Coach for Mr. Baldwin of Slough.
Defence. The Prosecutor came into this old Woman's House, and ask'd for a Woman, and for something to drink; Mrs Hinton brought him some Brandy or Gin - so he drank to me, and I to him; then we went up Stairs together for about an Hour; and I leave it to you to guess what we did there. He liked me so well, that he said he would come again, and make me a handsome Present; for, says he, 'tis Pity you should live in this old Bawd's House. I will keep you at Kensington. So the Thursday Night following he came again, and lay with me all Night; but on Sunday Night he got to Bed to another Lady of this old Woman's Family, and it made me so angry, that I pull'd off the Bed-cloaths; and he desired me to be quiet - he would oblige me too. I would not let him, but was still very angry: So he pull'd out the Purse and gave it me, not to make a Noise about the other Girl, and I carry'd it directly to Wingfield the Beadle. This old Woman keeps a notorious Bawdy-house; and ever since I have known her I have been miserable.
Worthington. I took her in foul, and cur'd her, as I do many of these poor Wretches; and I do it for never a Farthing; and when they are well, if they will go to Service, - they're welcome.
C. I am afraid you are the Occasion of these Wretches being in such unhappy Circumstances.
Jury. Where does the old Woman live?
A Witness. On the Backside of St. Clement's Church.

. March 7
.
Arabella Evans. If your Lordship pleases to swear Justice Frazier; he has an Account of the Goods; he has seen them all, and will be a Witness for me.
Q. Why can't you tell what you lost?
Evans. Really they are so many - There's Things of all Sorts, Damasks, Mantua Silk, Poplin, Stuff. I keep a little Mercer's Shop
, and took this Prisoner for my Maid
; her Master that she liv'd with before, told me she was honest, but I soon found she had a very saucy Tongue. Here, - where's the Constable? There's Justice Frazier, she own'd all the Goods to him, and he said he would be a Witness for me. Some of them she cut off of whole Pieces, and sometimes she took the whole Pieces; I'll swear they are all my own, and I have got the Remnants to match with some of them. This Italian Mantua Silk, she took to make her self a Gown and Petticoat; here's Sattins, Damasks, and every thing; here's all Sorts, and here's the Spying glass.
Q. When did you lose all these Things?
Evans. She went away from me on a Wednesday, 'tis a Matter of two Months ago. She lay in the Shop, and I suppose she got my Goods, by Piece-meal and Piece-meal, when I was a-bed.
Q. Did you miss them while she was with you?
Evans. No, no, I miss'd them after she was gone, and now I come to look over the Shop, I miss a great many Things more.
Q. How come you to think the Prisoner had them?
Evans. O my Lord, I found them upon her; they were in her Box, in her Lodging in Moore's Yard, by Church-court.
Q. Were they all found in her Lodging?
Evans. Part in her Lodging, and Part where she had left them, in order to their being pack'd up and sent off. When I own'd the Goods, she begg'd me not to prosecute her; - but why Nelly, says I, did you do so? Why the Devil pospossess'd me I think, said she. She told me that a Maid, who was an Acquaintance of her's, came to see her, and advis'd her not to cut off any more Bits, but to take the whole Pieces.
Q. Where were the other Things found?
Evans. I found some in Feather's alley. Here, why don't some of the Witnesses speak too? Why this Bundle I found at Mrs. Jane Tyree's in Feathers-alley, and the Goods in it are Part of what I lost.
Q. How do you know she carry'd them there?
Evans. Why she own'd she did. Ask her upon her Oath if she did not? If you require any more Questions - I say these are my own Goods; I can say no more.
Prisoner. She swore to a great many of my own wearing Things; she took the very Pins and Aprons out of my Box.
Evans. O, the Creature! She took all my Grandchild's Frocks, which cost me 14 s. apiece.
Prisoner. She took the Gown off my Back, and her Pretence was, that she could match it in her Shop.
Evans. Pray let Mr. Justice Frazier be sworn.

             Mrs. Evans brought me a Search Warrant, and I executed it. In her Lodgings we found a Poplin Gown, made up, and some of the same Stuft. While we were searching the Prisoner came in, and I secured her; we found several Things more, which have been ever since in my Custody. The best Part of the Goods was found in her Box, and Mrs. Evans was present. When we were going to the Justice, the Prisoner desired us to stay a little, and she would tell us where the rest of the Things were. Mrs. Evans taxed her with a Piece of Burdet, and she said, she had sold that to an Old Cloaths-Man, and hoped her Mistress would not prosecute her. We carry'd her before Mr. Justice Frazier, and he committed her that Night. This first Search was on Saturday, and on Sunday I was sent for again, to the same House, and we found some Trifles. On Monday we search'd Tyree's House, in Feather's-alley, in St. Martin's-lane, and there we found all the Things which were not made up.
Q. How come you to search Tyree's House?
Walker. The Prisoner was in the Gatehouse, and Mrs. Tyree came to Evans and inform'd her, that probably, some of her Goods might be found in her House. I asked her if any one was concerned with her, and she told me a Maid that used to come for Victuals in a Morning, advised her to it, and not to cut Bits off, when she had the same Opportunity to take the whole Piece. She told me, this Maid lodg'd some where at an Alehouse in the Hay market, but would not say who she was, nor tell me the House; only she said, she was a Welch woman.

             My Husband is a Taylor: We live in Feathers-Alley, but we keep a Stall against St. Martin's-Court. The Prisoner brought this Bundle to me, one Morning before I went to my Husband in his Stall, and desired me to take care of that Bundle for her, and told me, there was a great deal of Money's worth in it. I put it into our Room and went to the Stall to work. When we came Home at Night, she came again, and asked for her Bundle, come says she, I'll show you what I have got, and so she open'd the Bundle. Why, says I, you have bought a great many good Things; yes, says she, pray lend me a Yard: I bought all these Things in Piccadilly. When she had measur'd them, she said, the Measure was rather too short; why if 'tis so, says I, carry them back to the Man. No - she would not she said, for tho' the Measure was short, - she had them cheap enough, and I must keep them, 'till she call'd for them. This was on the Thursday, and on Sunday following, a Man came from the Gatehouse and enquired in the Alley for one Tyree; he found us out, and look'd like a credible Person. He asked me if I knew one Eleanor Smith. I told him no, for I did not know her Sirname: She knows you, says he, and she desires you to come to her; she is in the Gatehouse for thievery; so after Dinner I went, and she desired me to send her the Bundle, and I told her she should not have it; then she desired my Husband to pawn it, and bring her the Money, and she would satisfy him for his Trouble, but he said he would not do such a Thing for an hundred Pounds. After this we found out Mrs. Evans, and she own'd the Goods.

            . The Prisoner lodged in my House. On Saturday May the 5th, Mrs. Evans and another Person enquired for her, and told me they had a search Warrant; they found this Poplin Gown made-up, and these other Things in her Box which Mrs. Evans own'd. She sent the Box into my Apartment by a Porter, and when Mrs. Evans and the Constable came to search, she was not at Home, but she came in before they had done searching, and I fell upon her, and call'd her all to pieces for being guilty of such a Thing; tho' what she had at my Apartment, were but trifling Things. Before the Justice, the Prisoner own'd a Piece of blue Burdet to be Mrs. Evans's, and promis'd to let her have it again, and there was likewise some Remnants found in her Box, which the Prosecutor own'd.

            . I was present when the Prisoners Lodging was search'd, and when the Things were found; she confess'd she had taken a Piece of Burdet, and promis'd (if her Mistress would let her go) she would help her to it again: She said the same before Justice Frazier, and the Justice told her, if she would tell where it was, he would send for it; then she began to equivocate, and said she had sold it, to an Old Cloaths-Man. This was on Saturday, and on Monday the rest of the Things were found at Tyree's, and the Burdet among them.

            . The Prisoner brought this Coat to sell in Rosemary-Lane. A Man that lives there agreed to give him 8 s. for it, but was dubious about his Property in it; I being present, the Prisoner said, if I would go with him, he could satisfy me about his Character; so I went with him to one Bigs's against St. Giles's Church, but he was not to be spoke with; then he carry'd me me to another Place, and at last to his Father's, and his Father came back with us, to the Man that was to buy it; but he not liking the Men, would have nothing to do with, so they had it away again. Some little Time afterwards, Mrs. Myers came to the Shops in Rosemary-Lane to enquire after such a Coat; I found the Prisoner out and got him committed; this is the Coat.
Myers. This is Uriel's Coat.
Uriel. This is the Coat I carried Myers to clean.
Defence. I went to Rosemary-Lane to buy a Coat, and as I was going along, I met a Man with this upon his Arm, and I bought it; 'tis a great deal too little for me indeed, but as it came cheap, I bought it; I gave 6 s. and a full Pot of Beer for it.
Q. This is a good Defence; can you call your Witnesses and prove it?
Prisoner. No, I have no Witnesses.

Ann Oakes. The 3d of March, between 7 and 8 o'Clock at Night, I was just stepp'd about a Yard and a half from my Window to cut a Candle, and the Sash (which was pin'd down with a great Nail) was thrust up; I saw a Hand put into the Window, and that Hand took out a Silk Cap, a Hoop Coat, and an Ell of Holland, and a Bundle of Holland beside. I never pursu'd after the Thief, nor ever thought of hearing more about the Matter; but Mr. De Veil sent for me, and this Evidence informed against the Prisoner.

Thomas Newman, I live at the Blue-Boar-Inn in Holborn


. I lost this Clock off the Stair-case, and advertis'd it, but heard nothing of it, some Thieves being taken up at Westminster, one of them turn'd Evidence, and inform'd me, that the Clock was at one Mrs. Garton's, a Pawn-broker in Long-Acre.

                  Steere 
               



            . I gave this Clock to Mr. Newman; it had been in my Possession and hung in my Chamber at Christ-Church in Oxford, 2 Years. I know it from an hundred; there are Holes in the Case to hang it against the Wainscot, and the Pendulum is a little bent. I sent it from Oxford to Mr. Newman's.


                  Ann 
                  Garton 
               



            . I am a Pawnbroker, a single Woman. The Prisoner at the Bar lodged in Red-Lyon Court, in the House of one Reeves; the Prisoner and Reeves brought the Clock to me, and I lent half a Guinea upon it. I am sure the Prisoner was the Person that brought it to me, and he order'd me to deliver it to no body but him.


                  Charles 
                  Walker 
               



            . There were some People taken up on Suspicion of uttering false Money, and one of them turned Evidence, and inform'd about this Clock, and where it might be found. He said it was stole by one Liberty, from Mr. Newman's in Holborn. I acquainted him with what I had heard, so he got a Warrant, and found this Clock at Mrs. Garton's, which she deliver'd to us.
Defence. Liberty brought this Clock one Night into my Lodging, and Mr. Reeves pawn'd it for him the next Morning at this Gentlewoman's. Liberty ow'd me 4 s. 6 d. so I went to her, and desired her not to let the Clock go till she saw me, telling her that the Man owed me Money.
Mrs. Garton. The Prisoner and Reeves brought it to me, and the Money was paid to the Prisoner.
C. I would ask Mrs. Garton a Question: In the Way of your Trade (and 'tis a very bad one) don't you enter the Names of Persons who bring you Goods, and the Money you pay them, in Books?
Mrs. Garton. Yes. The Prisoner said it was his, and he bid me enter it in the Name of Thompson, and deliver it to none but himself.

            . On the 11th of March about five in the Morning, a Watchman came from St. Giles's, and knock'd us up, and enquired if we had not been robb'd? we found that a shew Glass near the Window had been broke, and it must have been done before the Shop was shut up, for the Shutters of the Window were whole and fast. The Goods mention'd in the Indictment, were taken out of this Shew-Glass, which I am sure was whole (and the Goods were in it) about a Quarter of an Hour before we shut up the Shop.
Latchlin Ross. His Evidence was to the same Effect.


                  Edward 
                  Haines 
               



            . We set out from -
Q. How old are you?
Haines. I was 14 last October.
Q. Do you know the Nature of an Oath?
Haines. Yes; I should not take a false Oath against any Body, if I do, I shall go to Hell; the Devil will have me, and I shall burn in Fire and Brimstone for ever. - We set out from Blunt's Cellar to Kensington the 10th of March; it was not quite Dark when we got there, so we walked up and down 'till Kensington Clock struck eight. Then we came to this House, and Powel took a Knife and cut the Putty from a Pane of Glass and took the Glass out; then he let some of the Glass fall down, and I took the rest out of his Hand and put it into a Cart-rut. When he had clear'd the Glass out, he took out the Silk Handkerchiefs and I took out four Pieces more, and five Pair of Stockings: then the Prisoner Starr came up, and he took out several more; how many, I cannot tell. Blunt and Drummond took out more. Powel made me try again, and I got more; but we observing a Gentlewoman to stand at some Distance, we were afraid of being discover'd, we bundled up the Things and carried them in our Bosoms and Pockets to Blunt's Cellar in Church-Lane, St. Giles's. (in this Cellar he sells Gin, and harbours Thieves and Pickpockets) When we came to Blunt's, we found there were seventy Handkerchiefs, and five pair of Stockings; that was one Pair for each of us, and the odd Pair was made a Present of to Blunt's Wife. We intended to sell all we had got the next Day, so we bundled them up again, and put them under Blunt's Bolster, and then we all went to Bed. Presently after this, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Steel 
               



            , Drummond's Wife came in and told us, that Blunt would certainly cheat us out of some of the Goods, because we were (all of us) drunk so William Starr went to Blunt's Bed, and would have the Goods from under his Bolster. Blunt would not part with them, but after some high Words, he threw them at him, and got out of Bed in his Shirt and charged the Watchman with Starr, and Starr charged the Watchman with Blunt. So the Discovery was made.
Q. How long have you been acquainted with this Company?
Haines. Not above three Months: My Father sent me to Tothill Bridewell, for stealing some Half-pence from him, and there I got acquainted with Starr. We us'd to be at Blunt's Cellar all Day, and at Night we us'd to turn out. If we had no Money he'd trust us, even to the value of 5 s. He supply'd us with Gin, and boil'd two-penny Mutton Chops for us. I came acquainted with Powel, at one Marget Fox's in Church-Lane, who was cast last Sessions for Transportation. Powel would have been glad to have been made an Evidence that he might have sav'd Starr, for Starr and he were born at Bristol, and were Townsmen.
Q. Does Blunt sell Gin, in his Cellar now?
Haines. Now - no not now, - but his Wife does.

            , Constable. Between twelve and one at Night March 10, Blunt came into the Watch-house in his Shirt, and Powel was with him; they called one another Thieves, and Powel said, he could carry me where I might take ten Thieves more. As I was going to take these ten Thieves, I met this little Boy (the Evidence) and Blunt's Wife, coming along with the Goods. Powel carry'd us to Blunt's Cellar, where we found Drummond and five Boys more. I intended Powel for an Evidence, but Mr. De Viel not thinking him ingenuous in his Confession, admitted this Boy ( Haines ) to be one.

Prisoner Blunt. They did come to my Habitation with about Half a Guineas-worth of Things, and afterwards when I was asleep, they brought in more and put them under the Beds Head, and my Wife and her Sister serv'd them, out of the Gin that I keep for my own drinking, to the Value of 2 s. 4 d. farthing. I found something was under my Head, and mistrusting 'twas not honestly come by, I jump'd out of Bed and accused them; they said they would swear my Life away, so carry'd some of them to the Watch-house, and order'd the Things to be carried to the Constable of the Night.
Blunt to Haines Did I ever sell any Thing for you, or take any Thing in Pawn from you?
Haines. Powel sold him a pair of ribb'd Stockings, but the Day before he was taken up. As he entertained us, we generally was in his Debt, so whatever we got, we brought to him, and left them with him till they were disposed of, and then we always paid him what we ow'd him. We ow'd him about a Crown when this Quarrel happen'd, and he would not be content to have 2 or 3 Pieces of Handkerchiefs, and that occasion'd this Riot. He was indeed at the taking of them, and got as many of them, as any one of us all.
Starr's Defence. In the first Place, my Lord, Haines and I, and 2 or 3 young Women, went to see the Men hang in Chains, and as we came back thro' Kensington, one of our Company said, there's a Chance for some Bird-ey'd Handkerchiefs; so we came to Blunt's, and resolved to set out the next Day: Accordingly next Day we went to one Adley's, and there we all din'd, and at 3 o'Clock we went to Kensington to rob this Man's Shop; we walk'd 2 Hours 'till 'twas dark, then Powel took out his Knife and cut the Putty, and took out the Glass, - so we got the Goods.

: On Friday the 4th of March, Thomas Hargrove, or Yorkshire Tom, (for that's one of his Names) and Matthew Martin, the 2 Prisoners came to our Shop to buy a Pair of Buttons, I asked them 20 d. for a Pair; Hargrove said, I must use him well, for he always came to Mr. Davis when he wanted any Thing in our Way; so I allow'd them for 18 d. and he threw down a 36 Shilling Piece to change, I put it into the Till, and took out a Box of Gold, and gave him a Guinea out of the Box, in part of his Change; then he asked me to let him have a Queen Ann's Guinea, I looked for one in my Box (which was full of Gold) and I found one; if you have got more of them says he, I should be obliged to you if you'd let me change them; but while I was laying down that which I had found, he slapp'd his Hand into the Box, and took out as many as he could grasp; then he turn'd his Hand, as tho' he would look for the Queen Anne's Money, and I saw he had as much Gold as cover'd the Palm of his Hand; I was surpriz'd, and would have taken it from him, but he turn'd his Hand upon the Box again, and gingled some of it in again, keeping his Thumb bent underneath the Palm of his Hand, - and there's your Money gain, he cry'd, - pray Madam give me my Change: His Handkerchief lying on the Counter, he took it up with the other Hand, and toss'd it into the Hand in which he had conceal'd the Money, and put it into his Pocket. When I recover'd my self, I said, - hark'e Sir, - I don't like your putting your Hand into my Box, - I desire to see what you've got in that Pocket; why, says he, d'ye think I have got your Money! - search me and welcome, I have above 20 Guineas about me; I will see, says I, what you have in that Pocket, and I did take Hold of his Coat, and endeavoured to put my Hand into his Pocket, but that Moment he clapp'd his Hand into it himself, and took out a Piece of rumpled Paper, and gave it to Martin, who stood behind him, and he ( Martin ) whipp'd it at once into his Coat Pocket, and at the same Instant I heard the Guineas chink as they fell to the Bottom of his Pocket. Why, says I, you've robb'd me! I robb'd you! says Yorhshire Tom (the lusty Fellow there) - yes, you, said I, - you took my Money, and your Companion has receiv'd it from you, and immediately I call'd out - Thieves! Thieves! I am robb'd! (for I had no Body in the Shop but my self.) When I cryed out so loud, they star'd upon each other, and Yorkshire Tom, and the other Prisoner Martin, threw me down, each of them a Guinea, and said, - there, there's your Money, but I ran towards the Window and beckon'd to the People, who were now gather'd at the Door, and when they came in, I told them, I had got a couple of Thieves. We have a Sash Door to the Shop, and it being Friday and Cattle coming in the Street, the Sash Door was shut, but my Maid hearing me cry out, she came down Stairs and had open'd the Door. I desired some of the People to call a Constable. -
Prisoners Did we endeavour to get away?
Mrs. Davis. No, they did not, - there was a great Croud about the Door, and they could not. - But when the Constable came in, I took them backwards, with several of my Neighbours; some of them knew Yorkshire Tom, and his Character, and desired me to take care of him. My Husband came Home presently after, and they told him, though they knew nothing of the Affair, yet they would give him 5 or 6 Guineas rather than he should expose them.
Q. How much Money did you miss.
Mrs. Davis. I can't tell exactly how much; but after the Hurley Burley was over, and I came to recollect my self, I found several Pieces of Gold missing.
Q. Were there more Pieces missing than those which they threw down again upon the Counter?
Mrs. Davis Yes several; but how many I can't really say; and as they were going before the Justice, I believe they shufled the Money from one to another, for they were search'd before him, and then Martin had none of it, but Hargrove had three Guineas and 9 s. 6 d. in Silver and 2 new Handkerchiefs.
Q. You are not sure those three Guineas were yours?
Mrs. Davis. No, I am not sure, but I believe they were as much mine as any one I ever had in my Life.
Councel. You can't be positive, what Money was in the Box.
Mrs. Davis. No; the Box will hold 30 Guineas.
Councel. And can you distinguish by taking two or three Guineas out, whether there has any been taken.
Mrs. Davis. Yes; four Guineas will make a great Vacancy; for it was a Box that screw'd, and 'twas quite full when I took it out to give them change.
Yorkshire Tom. The Box is so small, that I can't get my Finger into it.
Mrs. Davis. But you put all your Fingers into it. He insisted upon his 36 Shilling-piece, and I said, I have got your Money, and you have got mine. Well says Hargrove, whatever you think you have lost, I will give it rather than be expos'd.
Yorkshire Tom. Ask her if she did not turn my Pocket inside out?
Mrs. Davis. No, my Lord; I never put my Hand into his dirty Pocket. He had his 36 Shilling piece again before the Justice.


                  Samuel 
                  Davis 
               



            . I had been out about a Quarter of an Hour, when the Fact was committed; when I came Home, my Spouse declared the whole to me in the same Manner she has now done. I look'd over my Money, and miss'd 2 Guineas, beside the 2 Guineas which they had thrown her back. There was about 30 l - in the Box, - 14 Guineas and the rest Portugal Gold.
Q. Was all the Portugal Gold there?
Mr. Davis. I am doubtful of that; but I am sure there were 2 Guineas wanting. When we came before Sir 
               
                  Richard 
                  Brocas 
               



             they were search'd, and Hargrove had three Guineas and some Silver, but Martin had only 6 d. and a pair of Dice, about him. Martin keeps a sort of a Gaming Table, - a raffling stool.
Councel. You say there were both Guineas and Portugal Gold in it; are you sure there were so many Guineas?
Mr. Davis. Yes; I inspected the Guineas, but a triffling Time before I went out.
The Constable. The 4th of March I was sent for to Mr. Davis's, and found the 2 Prisoners there. I had a suspicion of them, for I had some Knowledge of Yorkshire Tom. I took charge of them; and when Mr. Davis came in, says Yorkshire Tom to him, may be you may know better what was in the Box than your Wife, tell it over; he did so, and said he miss'd Gold, but did not mention the Sum. When we came before the Justice, Yorkshire Tom told me, I might have made up this matter for them; I said, I did not understand making up such Things; why says he if you'll make it up I'll give 10 Guineas, and you shall have a handsome Present yourself.
Yorkshire Tom. You wanted me to give you 10 Guineas, and you sent for Mr. Taylor the Thief-taker with that Intent, and I said I would not pay any Thing in my Wrong.
The Constable. On my Oath, he propos'd the making up the Affair to me himself Taylor desired me to take Care of him; for (he said) he was a dangerous Fellow with his Knife. Yorkshire Tom, about two Months ago came to my Shop, and would have serv'd me the very same Trick I suppose, for he wanted some of Queen Anne's Guineas then too.
Councel. That does not relate to this Fact, and it must not be given in Evidence.
Hargrove's Defence. I made a Bargain for the Buttons, and she gave me Change out of a 36 s. Piece, I asked her to give me a Queen Anne's Guinea, and she did. I desired her to let me have another, and she tender'd the Money into my Hand, and bid me look my self; I look'd it over, and then bid her take her Money again.

            . I have known the Prisoners Seven Years: As to Martin I have dealt with him for some Pounds, and never found but that he was an honest Man. I live in Tottenham-Court Road, and deal in Plate, Martin deals in small Plate
 likewise.


                  John 
                  Bedford 
               



            . I'll speak nothing but the Truth; - I deal in Birds, my Lord, and live at St. Giles's in the Fields, Martin goes up and down the Country with small Plate.
Mr. Davis. My Lord, please to ask, if he does not go up and down with Dice and Totums, a Gaming?
Bedford. I know nothing of his Totum, his general Character is, that of an honest Man.
- Green. I was a Labourer a while ago; but now I am a Victualler in St. Giles's. Hargrove used to go about the Streets with a Wheel-barrow, what he does now I can't tell.
C. But his Trade is improved, he does not do so now.
Green. Martin used to go under the Name of an honest Man, in the Way of dealing fairly by his Neighbours, and not being given to quarelling.
Mr. Davis. Ask him if Hargrove has not been in Newgate before?
Hargrove. Yes, I have been there before, and so have you; for you have been 2 or 3 Times there to see me.
Green. Hargrove has been in Newgate before, but Martin (I believe,) never has.

                  Edwards 
               



            . Hargrove I know nothing off, I have been in Martin's Company some few Times, but I know very little of him neither.


                  Joshua 
                  Murphey 
               



            . I deal in Soot, and that very largely, and I live in Newtoner's-Lane. Martin I believe has a pretty good Character, and breeds his Children very behaving. I know no ill of Hargrove; he never did ill to me: I can't say - what I have heard, - I can't remember what I have heard, - I can't say so much to his Character.
Q. Has he a good or a bad Character?
Murphey. I don't know what to say in the Case.
Q. Have you heard any Hurt of him or not?
Murphey. Why, - if I must - speak the Truth, he has been in Newgate before.


                  Ann 
                  Edwards 
               



            . In Cross-Lane I live, by St. Giles's, and I keep a Chandlers Shop there. Martin lives in the Neighbourhood, and I only know him as a Neighbour - no, no, I have no Conversation with him, but he bears the Character of a civil Man there.
Q. Do you know Hargrove?
Edwards. I never was here before, and God bless me, I'll never come here again. - Yes, I have known him too some Years, - I won't forswear my self for any Body, - He used to sell Peas and Cherries, and Fruit about Streets. He was in Newgate once I know, for 'sulting Justice Midford in his Office, - nothing else, as I know of. Both

            , April 13
.
Mr. Hookham. Last Wednesday se'en-night, I order'd my Man to clean my Cloaths, and he hung this Coat on the Rails of the Stairs. I sent him out of an Errand, and went backward my self to a Stable I have in the Yard, after I had lock'd the Hatch at the Door. In a little Time my Brother came to see me, and he stopp'd the Prisoner in the Entry with the Coat upon her. I made her come back, into the Yard, and there she fell upon her Knees, and begg'd I would forgive her. She had one Pair of Pattens on her Feet, and another Pair in her Apron.


                  John 
                  Hookham 
               



             gave the same Account.
Prisoner. I had bought a Pair of Shoes about a Month ago of a Woman in that House, and she order'd me to call for something else, so I did, and the Coat happening to fall down, I only went to take it up.
Mr. Hookham. My Lord, I have not had a Woman Servant in my House these five Years. My Sister comes to make my Bed, when she's at Leisure; when she is not, my Man-servant does it.


                  Edmund 
                  Manning 
               



            . I have known the Prisoner 9 or 10 Years; she goes about with China and old Cloaths. I have entrusted her to collect Rent for me to the Value of 100 l. and she never wronged me.
Mr. Hookham. Ask him if he has known, or entrusted her within these three Years?
Manning No, I have not.
Mr. Hookham. I would ask him, whether she has not had the Character of a drunken, disorderly Woman for these three Years?
Manning. I never heard any thing but that she was honest.
Mr. Hookham. This very Person apply'd to me to make up the Matter, and to know the Circumstances of the Fact; I told him, he should hear them in this Place; and the Mother of the Prisoner was with him, and declared in his Presence, that she was a drunken, idle, disorderly Person.
Q. Did you hear this?
Manning. Yes, I did.
Q. Then how could you give her this good Character?
Manning. Drunkenness is not Dishonesty.


                  Michael 
                  Bell 
               



            . I never knew her dishonest; she will drink Gin indeed.


                  Ann 
                  Manson 
               



            . I have known her many Years, I never heard of her wronging any Body.
Q. Do you keep Company with the Prisoner much?
Manson. No.
Q. Has she not had the Character of a drunken Woman these 3 Years?
Manson. I never saw her drunk.
Q. I ask you whether she has not that Character?
Manson. Why - as to Drunkenness - I never heard any thing of Theft.
Q. Why don't you answer the Question?
Manson. Why, yes I have heard something of that; but a Person is not to be hang'd or transported for Drinking.
Jury. I desire to know how the Gentleman can live in a House, without a Woman?
Mr. Hookham. Sir, If you desire to know the Oeconomy of my Family, I'll give it you in a few Words. My Sister, when she has Leisure, comes to make my Bed; when she has not, my Man does it.
C. The People that have appear'd to the Prisoner's Character, have behav'd in so odd a Manner, that they need call some Persons to their own.

            . I keep a Chandler's Shop
. On the 18 th of February about seven o'Clock at Night, I saw my Shop Door latched with an iron Latch; I was in a back Room behind the Shop, and a Boy came and told me I was robb'd: I went directly to see what I had lost, and looking about, I miss'd the Till, Money, Lock and Key, - all was gone together. The Boy told me he saw them and knew them.
Burn. Pray Mr. Atwood, was the Door fast?
Atwood. Yes.
Burn The Door was open; we never broke a Lock in our Lives: We had no Knives, nor any Thing to open a Door with.


                  William 
                  Walton 
               



            , (the Boy) I was going of an Errand, and saw the two Prisoners, and Jones the Accomplice at Mr. Atwood's Door about 7 o'Clock, (I don't remember the Night) but Jones cross'd the way and stood still: Burn open'd the Door, and brought out the Till, and left the Door open When Burn came out with it in his Hand; Jones cross'd the way to him again, and they all went out together: Burn spoke to Ingram when he came out, but what he said I was not near enough to hear. I knew all of them, and so I told Mr. Atwood.
Q. Was it so light at 7 o'Clock in February, that you could know their Faces.
Walten. It was dark; but there was a Lamp by the Door and the Shop Windows were open. I don't know whether I could distinguish their Faces, if there had been no Lights.
Q. Did Ingram and Jones seem to be of the same Company?
Walton, Yes, they were all 3 standing together at the Door, when I pass'd by them.
Burn. Do you know whether the Door was latch'd or no?
Walton 'Twas a Hatch, and 'twas fast; I saw him lean over it and open it, tho' I cannot say I saw him lift up the Latch.
Burn. The Door was a Foot open, when I went to the Door: I only went in for a Farthing's worth of Small-Beer, and the Till was half in, half out, and that was not lock'd neither.
Ingram. Did you see me at the Door?
Walton Yes; I knew them all 3 very well, and saw all their 3 Faces, but did not speak to them.


                  John 
                  Jones 
               



            . About the middle of February, the 2 Prisoners and I, coming down the Street, saw Mr. Atwood's Door shut. I cross'd the Way and stood still: Burn went in and brought out the Drawer, and we ran together to the end of Bell-Alley; then Ingram perceiving that Burn's Hand was in the Drawer, - You Rogue, says he, what are you doing, and took it away from him; there was 23 s. and Eight-pence half-peny in it; if there was more, Burn sunk it while his Hand was in it. The Money was empty'd into my Apron, and at the Tobacco-Roll against St. Andrew's Church in Holbourn we shar'd it. I had 6d, less than either of the Prisoners, for they said 6d, had been lost, and so to prevent Disputes I took the Loss to my self. We had some Beef-stakes dressing then for our Suppers, but Ingram's Mother informing us that Mr. Atwood was coming upon us, we went away without eating them.
Q. Was the Hatch latch'd or not?
Jones. Yes, it was; for he push'd against it, and it would not open, then he lean'd over, and lifted up the Latch?
Q. On your Oath, Did you see him lift up the Latch?

Jones. I can't say I saw him lift it up, but I saw him lean over, and then it opened. There was a Light in the Shop, but 'twas Dark in the Street.
Burn. I never touched the Latch with my Hands, and how can he say he saw me lift it up, when he stood on the other side of the way.
Jones. I was not more than 3 yards distance from the Door.
Burn. My Lord, we had just stole some brass Weights, and the Evidence carried them to his Wife to sell for us, and he came back to us after I came out of the Shop, and said, Charles, have you made the Lob?
Jones. This was half an Hour before.
Burn. My Lord, he is an old Rogue; he brings up Youth to Thievery, and then Swears against them for the sake of the Reward.
Ingram. The Night this Robbery was Committed, I was at the Magpye at Holbourn-Bridge, and Burn and Jones came in there; my Mother persuaded me to go out of the way, and with long Persuasion I did: I knew nothing of these Fellows, not I. To Ingram's Character,

                  Gill 
               



            , appear'd.
Ingram. If the Rogue had not Swore so heartily against me, I could have had 40 more to have appear'd for me.
Burn I serv'd his Majesty; but have fell into bad Company; I was just about to leave off, when the Evidence Jones Swore this against me. * My Lord, when Jones and I, and Ingram, stole the Weights, it wanted half an Hour of Dark, and he only went up the next Alley with them to his Wife, and while he was gone, we did this, so it could not be Dark.
* This Declaration, and the Prisoner's Questions with Regard to the Time, and the Doors being fast, were to make the Burglary doubtful.

               receiving eleven Pieces of the same, knowing them to be stole
            . Dunnick 


               pleaded guilty
            .
Mr. Uthar. I spent two or three Weeks enquiring after the Prisoner Dunnick, and in the Course of my Enquiry, I found that Smith and his Wife had pawned some of the Pieces so they were committed on Suspicion. The Woman is Dunnick's own Sister; he liv'd with them at that Time, and she conceal'd him. Some of the Silver they had pawn'd to Mrs. Gordon, and some to Mr. Wild, who are both in Court. These are the Piece.s
Mr. Wild. I live in White-Cross Street: Elizabeth Smith brought two of the Pieces to me, and borrow'd six Shillings upon them the 29th of March. Afterwards on the 31st, she and 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Dunnick 
               



             brought five more, and had 16 s. upon them.
Mr. Gordon. About ten Weeks ago I lent 13 Shillings and odd Money to 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     Smith 
                  



                
            , upon Four Pieces, but he had them again the next Day.
Mr. Wild. These are the very Pieces brought the 29th and 31st of March by the Woman Prisoner; here are the Tickets I pinn'd upon them when I lent the Money.
Mr. Utbar. Smith and his Wife both deny'd that they ever had any Pieces of Eight; and his Wife knew that I was in Pursuit of Dunnick, yet she told me that she harbour'd him and concealed him. Her Husband sent me a Message, that he desired me to give him a Meeting on the 31st of March, and I reproached him with concealing his Brother; this was the very Day upon which he pawn'd some of the Pieces to Mrs. Gordon Mrs. Smith owned she had the Pieces from her Sister Dunnick.
Thomas Smith I never had any of the Pieces from Dunnick. I deal in Needles
, and I took these Pieces in Truck of a Sailor at Wapping for my Goods.
Mrs. Gordon. When he pledg'd them with me, he said he had them of a Sailor at Wapping, and truck'd Needles for them.
Mr. Utbar. She deny'd her having pawn'd any at all; and afterwards she said, she had them of Dunnick.
Mr. Wild. She did deny she, ever pawn'd any. Her Sister was with her when she pawn'd them, and she said her Husband desired her to pawn them.
Several Witnesses appear'd who never knew any Hurt of Smith and his Wife Both 

               acquitted

. May 1
.
Glasspool. Between 10 and 11 o'Clock at Night, the first of May, I was coming thro' Whitechappel


 to my Lodgings in Billiter-Lane, and I met with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Solomon 
               



            , that little Girl
 at the Bar, and she desired me to give her a Glass of Liquor; the other (Wilson) perswaded me to go to their Lodging. I went with them, and when I got into the House I gave them a Shilling to get a full Pot of Flip: While we were drinking the Flip Wilson got her Hands about my Waist, under my Cloaths, and drew my Watch out of my Fob. I seized her Hand with the Watch in it; she dropp'd it down, and I took it up again and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket, and told them, I would stay no longer with them, because I saw they had a Mind to defraud me of my Watch. Wilson rapp'd out an Oath, and assur'd me, she scorn'd to use any Gentleman so ill; so I staid a quarter of an Hour longer, and she got about me again, and took the Watch out of my Pocket and gave it the little one (Solomon) who stood behind Wilson and me. 'Tis true, I did not see her, but I felt her, and my Watch could go no other Way; beside, I saw her push her Hand by my Side, towards Solomon.
Q. Did you and Wilson sit together?
Glasspool. We were upon the Bed together. - She and I were upon the Bed's-Feet. She threw her self upon the Bed's-Feet, and swore I should - have to do with her, and so she pull'd me upon the Bed to her, and as we lay together I felt her take the Watch, and saw her push her Hand by my Side, towards Solomon, who stood behind us at the Feet of the Bed. I would have got up immediately, but she had got her Arms about me, and held me fast, that I might not pursue Solomon. However, I made shift to slip out of her Arms, and I ran after Solomon; I saw her go into the next House, and a Jew being at the Door, I said, Sir, I have lost my Watch, and the Woman that has got it, is come into this House; and tho'I saw her go into the House with my own Eyes, yet the Jew would face me down, that no body was come in there.
Wilson. When you found the Watch drawing out of your Pocket, pray why did not you lay hold of it?
Glasspool. 'Twas done so suddenly, that I had not Time. - I stood at the Jew's Door a quarter of an Hour, and then she came out and run into another House; and while I was waiting at this Door, Wilson came out with her Petticoats over her Head, and went into the House where Solomon now was. I got into this House, and here they offer'd to be searched.

            . I saw Wilson and Solomon in the Cage at Whitechappel the 2d of May: I told Nan, she had made good Haste to get in here, when I saw her at her own Door last Night at past Ten o'Clock; for when she was before Justice Philips, she said she had not been out all Night.

            . Glasspool was at my House that Night about Ten o'Clock, and he had his Watch when he went away. The little Girl has got a Husband, one Solomon (a Jew) and he came to me and said, if the Man would not prosecute, he should have his Watch again.
Wilson. The Man told me when he and we were together, that he had been in Company with some Women, and had lost his Watch. He wanted me to be concerned with him in a very sad, ugly Thing which I am ashamed to speak of, and because I would not consent, he said he would swear it upon me. He was very troublesome in our Court, and call'd Watch, Watch, and I got a Watchman and a Constable to get him home.
James Hill. Wilson lived at the Waterman's-Arms, St. Mary Overies Stairs. (I come to give her a Character.) After that she liv'd at the African Coffee-House; she behav'd well, and was a clean Girl.

I miss'd it the 1st of March; it was put up in a Box in my Bed-Room; the Box was locked, but I found the Lock broke, and as none comes into that Room but the Prisoner, we suspected him and charged him with it. He did not confess it at first, but about 3 Hours after we had taxed him with it he made a Confession that he took about 9 Guineas; that he open'd the Lock with a Picker, such as we pick Horses Feet with, and that he had lost some of the Money at Gaming; he shew'd us where the rest was hid, and we found 6 Guineas, 8 Shillings, and 3 Six-pences.

            . About 4 or 5 o'Clock, August 5, I was carrying a Bundle of Mr. Stepple's Things to the East-Ham Coach; the Prisoner met me in Whitechapple


, and asked me if I did not come out of Thames-street? I told him no; then he enquired if I was not going to the East-Ham Coach with my Bundle? I said, - Yes. You'll be too late, says he, the Coach is just going off, and so he snatched the Parcel from under my Arm, and away he ran with it, and turn'd up Gulston-street. I follow'd him, and cry'd Stop Thief; upon which several People pursued him, and he threw down the Bundle, in hopes of making his Escape, but he was taken in Gulston-Square. I am positive to the Prisoner, because he was not three Minutes out of my Sight.
Q. Was he carry'd before a Justice of the Peace?
Castle. Yes; and I was present, and charged him with taking the Things, but he did not say any Thing to excuse himself, as I heard.

Prisoner. Ask him whether he did not give me the Bundle to carry for him?
Castle. No? he snatch'd it out of my Hands.
Q. Where does the East-Ham Coach stand?
Castle. At the White Hart and Three Tobacco Pipes, in Whitechapple.
Q. When he had got the Bundle from you, did he run towards the Inn?
Castle Yes, he ran a little Way towards the Inn, and then he cross'd the Street from the Inn, and ran up Gulston street.
Prisoner I walked a little Way before him, - pray, ask him why he did not immediately cry out - Stop Thief?
Castle. Because I thought he might belong to the Inn, 'till I saw him run out of the Way.

            . I was going up Gulston-street, on the 5th of August, and heard the Boy (Castle) cry - Stop Thief. I turn'd to see what was the Matter, and the Prisoner was just then at my Elbow. As he ran, he threw down the Bundle, so I call'd out - Stop Thief, and though he run very fast, yet the People took him at the Corner of the Square. I am very positive the Prisoner is the Man that was taken, but he flew so swiftly by me, that I could not then take any particular Notice of his Face. I said to him, - you Rascal, how dar'd you take the Bundle from the Lad? why, says he, I did not design to run away with it; this was his Answer, as near as I can remember.

            . I happen'd to be in Gulston-Square at this Time, and seeing the Prisoner runing along, without either Hat or Wig, and hearing People cry Stop Thief, I took hold of him, and held him 'till the Boy and the other Witness came up. He had nothing upon him, when I seized him, for (it seems) he had thrown the Bundle away before I saw him.
Defence. I was walking along, and met the Boy very hard loaded; I asked him how far he was going? He told me he was going to the Ham Coach. I told him I would help him; so he gave me the Bundle to carry for him; but I had not gone far, before I saw some Bailiffs following me, and considering that I owed a Man 5 l. I flung down the Bundle and took to my Heels: upon which the Boy cry'd out, - Stop Thief, and these People took me.

Richard Cox. I keep a Publick-House
; on Monday the 29th, of August, the Prisoner came in between 1 and 2, after Dinner, and call'd for a Tankard of Beer. I pass'd to and fro' in the House, while he was drinking his Beer, and at last some body call'd me out into the Street: I look'd back and saw the Prisoner go towards the Necessary-House in the Yard. When I went in again, I met the Prisoner coming out: I observ'd his Coat was then button'd up close, when he came in it was open. Here, says he, take your Reckoning, (and he gave me a Shilling) if a Man in a green Coat should come to ask for me, tell him I am gone. But seeing something button'd up in his Coat, I pull'd it open, and found these Six Plates upon him. I carry'd him before Sir

Defence. My Lord, there was a young Man with me, and it was he that gave me the Plates: Says he to me, there are some Plates in the Yard, we'll have half a Dozen of them: I bid him let them alone, but he would take half a Dozen, and then he gave them to me, and I put them in my Bosom. - Here Mr. Cox, you did not give me my Change out of the Shilling, I gave you for the 3 Pints of Beer, I hope you'll give it me now.
Cox. Aye, - Here's your Change, - and I thank you for leaving the silver Tankard behind you.

He said a Cooper had given it him, and that he only went up into the Buildings to pick up a few Hoopsticks; but at last he rapp'd out an Oath, and bid Weldon take Care what he did, for he could not swear he saw him take it. He shamm'd being drunk, - but so he has done very frequently upon the Keys. I have seen him with something in his Hat-several Times upon the Wharfs, and have had several Runs after him, but could never take him 'till now.

Tapling. 'Twas I that took the Thief, and the Gentleman asked me my Name, and said he would prosecute him, if it cost him five hundred Pounds. I did take hold of the Prisoner indeed, and the Gentleman asked me my Name, and made me come here against the Prisoner.
Prisoner. I had been drinking in a Booth, and was in Liquor; so meeting with a Boy who had won this Cake at the Turnabout Thing, I bought it of him. They say, I am a notify'd Thief, but it will appear quite contrary, for I am an innocent young Fellow.

Robert Heathfield. On the 29th of August in the Morning, the Prisoner came to my House, (I am a Surgeon
) with a Tumour upon her Hand: I told her I must open it, before it would be well, which I did accordingly. The next Day she came again to have it dress'd, and then she stole a Stock, and Stock-buckle. I mistrusted her; so as she was to come again, I pull'd out one of my Knee-buckles and laid it down in the Window, and when she came the next Day to have her Hand dress d, I went into a Back-room, and left her in the Surgery to put on her Rollers herself. When my Patient was alone, she took the Buckle; I watch'd, and saw her, and I suffer'd her to go out of the House, and follow'd her half-way up the Street; then I took her and the Buckle upon her. She was a poor Woman, and I had often done such Jobbs for her out of Charity, and never have had any Thing for my Pains. When she was before the Justice, she said if I would let her go, she would give me an Account of all she had taken from me at other Times, as well as at this; So she confessed, that about a Twelvemonth ago, she stole a Shirt from me, - I have lost a great many other Things, but did not charge her with them. She confessed that she had, (at this Time of her coming to my House) stole a Stock, a Stock-buckle, and a Knee-buckle.
Prisoner. I do not know any Thing of it - please to do any Thing with me, but pray don't Transport me.

            . I charge the Prisoner with taking the Lead from the top of the Houses, on Saturday Morning, the 30th, of July. Two of these Houses are empty; they stand at the lower end of Foxes lane, near Pelican-stairs, Shadwell


. I was call'd out of Bed between 2 and 3 o'Clock in the Morning, and found the Lead carried about 16 Feet from the Place where it was fixed, and just ready to be thrown down.
A Witness. I can't say any Thing to the Prisoner's taking the Lead, but hearing the Noise that Thieves were upon the Top of the House, I went up, and saw the Lead ripp'd up, and the and the Prisoner behind the Chimnies. I endeavoured to take him and he dodg'd me round the Chimnies, but at last he said, if I would not hurt him, he would surrender. The Lead was mov'd 16 or 18 Feet from the Place where it was fix'd.
Another I was on board a Ship hard by, but hearing the People say, a Thief was behind the Chimnies, I came ashore with a Staff 6 Feet long, and a Ladder being raised against the Houses, I went up, and asked the Prisoner what he did there. What's that to you says he? Come along say's I, and immediately I seized him, and brought him down. There was about 2 hundred Weight, roll'd up and carry'd to the Corner of the House, just ready to throw down.
Q. When did any of you see the Lead fix'd?
Gillings. We see it almost every Day.
Defence. I came from Shadwell Market to these Houses, and the Street being all in an Uproar, I asked what was the Matter? The People told me, that somebody was stealing Lead from the Tops of the Houses; so I went up the Ladder to help them take the Thief, and when I was upon the Top of the House, that Man came up with his Staff and knocked me down.
A Witness. I was the Man that set up the Ladder; I was the first that went up, and there was no Person upon the House but the Prisoner.
Gillings. I help'd this Man to raise the Ladder; the Prisoner never went up the Ladder. - I believe he got in at the Cellar-Window of an empty House.

 by Trade. This very Day the 29th of July, I sent him with two Rabbets to Poplar; he return'd to our House between 8 and 9 o'Clock at Night, and 'twas half an Hour past One before he left us.
Q. And what then?
Tyler. Why I never heard any ill of him in my Life.
Q. To the Prisoner. You say you are a Brick-layer, where are any of your Masters, for whom you have work'd?

.
Joshua Howard. The Prisoner liv'd 3 Weeks with me as a Servant
; on the 18th of July, in the Morning, she went away, - before my Wife was up. Her going away in this Manner made me suspect she had robb'd me, so I search'd about the House, and I miss'd 5 Guineas, a Silver Spoon, and a Gold Ring; they were lock'd up in a corner Cupboard.
Q. Was the Cupboard broke?
Howard. No; therefore I suppose she had a Key which would open it; or she might watch her Opportunity and take our Keys.
Q. When, and how did you take the Prisoner?
Howard. I was informed she was at Islington, so I went there, and met her last Sunday Night near the Green Man, in the Road to Holloway. I charged her with the Robbery, and told her she must go with me; she said, she had not meddled with any Thing, but as we were coming along, she owned that she had taken two Guineas. I got a Warrant for her that Night, and carry'd her before a Justice; there she own'd she took the Spoon out of the Cupboard, and had laid it upon a Shelf in the Shop, upon which the Justice committed her to Prison. On-the Tuesday, the Justice would have had her to have sign'd her Confession, but she refused. She told us, that she had taken the two Guineas one Morning when my Wife was gone to Covent Garden. We are both of us out every Morning about two Hours; she goes out with Fruit, and I with Milk.
Howard's Wife. A Neighbour having informed me, that my Maid liv'd extravagantly when I was abroad, I suspected her to be the Thief; so I enquired into the Affair, and I found out this Mrs. Victor, her Acquaintance. Mrs. Victor had receiv'd a Guinea from the Prisoner, to buy Shifts and Aprons. Upon this, I taxed her with the Robbery; - She wished sad Wishes, if ever she was Mistress of a Guinea in her Life: (this was one Night when we were going to Bed.) I told her I would enquire farther into it next Morning, but next Morning, when I got up, - my Maid was run away.

                  Victor 
               



            . I did not know any Thing of her having any of Howard's Money: - 'tis true - indeed, - she did give me a Guinea to buy some Linnen for her; and she told me it was Part of her Wages, receiv'd at a Place in the Country; but a Fellow-Servant where she had left her Cloaths, having run away with them, she must desire me to lay out that Guinea in Linnen for her.
Q. When was all this?
Victor. This was within a Week after she came into Howard's Service. I saw she had 2 Guineas more, (at that Time) and some Silver.
Mrs. Howard. The Prisoner own'd, that she took the Money out of a Horn Cup, two or three Days after her first coming to us.
Defence. I am very Innocent, - I was frighted when they took me, and did not know what I did
Q. But what was the Reason that you ran from your Service in so abrupt a Manner? What do you say to that?
Prisoner. I was frighted, - and so I was, when I was before the Justice.
Mr. Howard. She was never threaten'd at all; she confessed voluntarily where the Things were.

            . I keep a Pawnbroker's Shop
 upon Saffron Hill


. On the 31st of May I lent 4 l. upon this Gown and Petticoat, and the Gentlewoman that brought them to pawn, giving me a great Charge about them, I wrapp'd them up in a Napkin, and carry'd them into a Parlour behind the Shop; in the Afternoon my Maid carry'd them into the Shop again, and while they lay there, the Prisoner came in to redeem a Petticoat. I was busy in the Parlour with a Man that came to see my Maid, so she went up Stairs to fetch down the Prisoner's Petticoat, and in the mean Time she found Means to convey away the Suit of Cloaths. I did not miss them 'till next Morning, and then I imagin'd my Maid had put them away; but soon after I missed the Things, the Prisoner came in, and told me that she had met with a rich Uncle, who had given her 3 Guineas, and she was so full of Money, that she gave me 15 s. for a Gown that was forfeited, and hung up for Sale. This gave me a Suspicion that the Prisoner was a Thief; so I got a Warrant from Justice Poulson and took her before him; there she own'd that she had pawn'd the Things, but she said she had them from a Woman in Hatton-Garden. The Justice asked her, where this Woman, and her rich Uncle and Aunt were to be found? She told him they were all gone over Sea; and the Justice told her, he believ'd she would be sent after them.
Q. And where did you find the Goods at last?
Birchmore. At one Mrs. Aris's in Baldwin's-Gardens.


                  Rebecca 
                  Aris 
               



            . The Prisoner pledged these Goods with me for 3 Guineas and a half, the 31st of May. She told me they belonged to a Gentlewoman in Hatton-Garden, who was sick, and was straiten'd for Money, and that when she was well she would fetch them again. I saw the Cloaths were very good, therefore I refused to receive them unless she could give an Account of her self; upon this, she carry'd me to one Mrs. Hale, who keeps a Potter's Shop in the Neighbourhood, and Mrs. Hale told me, I might safely lend her the Money. I let her have it accordingly, and kept the Cloaths 'till the People came to enquire for them, and I deliver'd them to the Constable.
Mr. Cook, Constable. These Goods I found at Aris's, and she swore they were brought to her by the Prisoner. I have had them in my Custody ever since.

Q. To Birchmore. Is this Shop of yours next the Street?
Birchmore. Yes, I take in Pledges, and now and then hang up a Thing in it, (that happens to be forfeited) to sell.
Q. Who did this Gown and Coat belong too?
Birchmore. To one Mr.

            . About the 11th or 12th of July, I let the Prisoner a Lodging in my House at 3 s. a Week; she came in the Evening, and then I saw all my Goods in the Room, for I help'd her to make the Bed. In the Morning I intended she should breakfast with me, so I went up Stairs. to call her, but no Body answered. About 12 I open'd the Door, and found the Bed just as I had made it the Night before, - only it was stripp'd, and the rest of my Goods were gone. About a Month afterward, one Mrs. Cotton inform'd me, that she had seen some of my Things in a Broker's (one Mrs. Bushnel's ) Shop in Castle-Street. Upon this, I went thither, and found my Looking-glass, but the Broker would have 6 s. for it.
Mrs. Cotton. About a Week after the Prosecutrix was robb'd, we found the Candlestick and the Glass at Bushnel's, and nothing more, for the Constable did not search carefully; he open'd no Boxes nor Drawers.
Roberts. Bushnel informed us, she had the Goods of the Prisoner, and the Prisoner when she was before Justice Mercer own'd she took them.

            . The Prisoner when she was produc'd, acknowledged that she had stole a Candlestick, a Blanket, and a Looking Glass and no more; but 4 Days after this, she own'd that she took all the rest, and had sold them all to this Bushnel.
( Bushnel not appearing, the Court order'd her Recognizance to be estreated )
Prisoner. I am very well acquainted with this Mrs. Bushnel, and happening to be there one Day, who should I see with Mrs. Bushnel but fat

            ; so they took me to the Gin-shop, and made me almost drunk, while we were at the Gin-shop says Betty Cook, I want a little Money, - let's go and take a Lodging. We agreed upon it, and went out together for that Purpose: when we came to Mrs. Robert's House, says Cook there's a Bill up, - and 'twas the first Bill we came at, - do you go in and take the Lodging, and so I did. At Night I went to my new Lodging, and at a proper Time I handed the Things out to them - they waited at the Door for them. My Lord, I am a Housekeeper my self at Hyde Park Corner, - please to let me suffer here, by burning me in the Hand, - or what you please.
Justice Mercer. I granted a Warrant to search Bushnel's House, and had her before me, and she said the Prisoner was to be produced, for she liv'd at Hyde-Park Corner. What the Prisoner says now is very different from what she said when she was before me.

Q. Which way did he get into the Stable?
Green. Thro' a Sash Window. I waked just as he had drest himself in my Cloaths, and cry'd - who's there! upon that he jump'd out at the Window; I open'd the Door and took him directly.

- Nuttal. I am a Watchman, and was calling the Hour, - 'twas past Three o'Clock, when Christopher Green call'd me to assist him. I saw the Prisoner jump thro' the Window; Green seiz'd him and order'd me to take Care of him. He had the Man's Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches upon him. I asked him how he came to take the Things? And he told me, - the Devil put it into his Head.
Another Witness confirmed the former Depositions.

Abraham Castle. I charge the Prisoner with stealing about 40 lbs. of Lead from my Stable We found him sitting in St. Ann's-Court with a Parcel of it under him, while his Companion Reeves was selling the rest at an Ironmonger's over the Way in Dean-Street. The Prisoner was taken with this Lead in his Possession, and he impeach'd Reeves.

On the first of August we miss'd about a third Part of the Lead from the Gutter over my Master's Stables, and about a Week after one Dyos, a Carver, told us he had taken a Man with a Quantity of Lead in his Custody; I went to St. Ann's Round House, and saw the Prisoner; from thence he was carried before Mr. Justice Deveil. The Lead we found all belonged to Mr. Castle, and the Prisoner told us he had it from Reeves, and directed us to Reeves's Cellar, where we might find more. We went accordingly, and found several Pieces more; and upon comparing it with the rest that was left upon the Gutter, it tally'd so exactly, that I am sure nothing but the Knife parted it. The Prisoner was pretty open in his Confession; he owned that he helped Reeves up to the Top of the Stable, and received the Lead from him.

            . These are 5 Pieces out of 12, which we lost out of our bleaching Grounds, the 23d of June last. We could get no Information concerning them a great while: but at last I heard of a Woman, who knew something of them. The Prisoner at that Time, worked at Mr. Gerrard's, and he having a Ring of this Woman's, she came to enquire after her Ring; the Prisoner told her he had some Pieces of Printed Linnen, and desired her to get some Money upon them: One Mr. Vincent over-hearing this Discourse, informed me of it, and I found out that Woman, the next Witness. The Goods were found in the Possession of one 
               
                  Grace 
                  Adkins 
               



            , but she is secreted. These Pieces now produced, are Part of the Goods taken from the Bleaching Grounds; they are not half finished, or whiten'd, nor are half the Colours in them which they should have.
Q. Why do you lay them as the Goods of a Person unknown?
Mr. Movillion. Because they have cut of the Marks at the Ends of the Pieces, by which we know every Man's Goods.


                  Mary 
                  Skreen 
               



            . The Prisoner at the Bar about 4 Months ago, took a Ring from me, and when I went to him to ask after my Ring, he told me he had 7 Pieces of printed Linnen to dispose off, so one Day he brought the 7 Pieces to me, and desired me to get him 7 Guineas upon them, if you can do it says he, I have 4 Pieces more, and I will bring you them too; I told him I could not raise the Money; then he asked me if Grace Adkins could, and while we were talking of her, who should come in but Grace her self; I did tell her of these Pieces of Linnen, but indeed, my Lord, I did not ask her to lend the Money upon them. Grace told the Prisoner, tho' she could not lend so much Money upon them, yet she would borrow it, and she did so, and I saw the Money paid to the Prisoner, and the Goods deliver'd to Grace. I did not take Notice of the particular Time, but I think it was about a Month before the Prisoner was taken up. - Hold, - by Recollection 'twas about the 25th of July, and there were 6 Pieces then pledged to her. She ( Grace Adkins) lives at 'Squire Clark's at Spring Gardens
Q. Pray what's become of this Grace Adkins?
Skreen. I did not see her for a Month after the Goods were pawn'd to her, not till the very Night that the Prisoner was taken up; then she produced the Goods, and she fell out and quarrell'd with me for saying any Thing about them.
Q. What's become of Grace now?
Skreen. I do not know indeed.

            . Grace Adkins borrow'd the 7 Guineas of me, which the Prisoner had upon the Goods; she was to pay me again. I never saw the Prisoner before that Time, when Grace paid him this Money for the Pieces of Linnen, but I never saw them open'd.
Skreen. This is one of the Pieces that he then deliver'd.
Mr. Movillion. I took the Goods at Grace Adkins's Lodgings, the 24th of July.

                  Webb 
               



            , Constable. These are the same Goods which were deliver'd me at Grace Adkins's Lodging; and she own'd before the Justice that they were the very same which the Prisoner brought to her. At the Watch-house he told us, he bought them of a Scotsman, one 
               
                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            , who traded to Holland. These are the same Pieces, - here's 4 whole Pieces, and 2 half Pieces.
Skreen. He brought first 2 Pieces - then four; and one of them he redeem'd the Night before he was taken up.
Prisoner. If I may be indulged 'till to Morrow Morning I will bring my Witnesses.
Q. Where's this Grace Adkins?
Prisoner. I don't know, she's a Stranger to me.
Q. To Skreen Has the Prisoner used any Endeavours to get you out of the Way?

Skreen. Grace Adkins came to me about 4 Days after the Prisoner was sent to the Gate house, and told me, if I would go there to him, he would give me my Ring; so I went to him, and he told me, if I would not appear against him, I should never want Money or Friends. I said I would take Councel upon it, and accordingly he sent me to his Father's Agent, and he told me I might get off with Ease, and that drawing ( withdrawing ) the Cullisses (Recognizances) would not cost above 14 or 15 s. I had set my Mark to one of the Peices, and his Sister came and begg'd me not to Swear to that, because it would save his Life.
C To the Prisoner. Your Trial was put off in the Morning, because your Friends were not come, who were to give an Account how you came by this Linnen?
Prisoner. They are not come yet.
C. If you have any Witnesses send for them, you shall have an Hour allow'd you.
The Prisoner was taken from the Bar, and allow'd an Hour's Time to produce his Witnesses, but none appearing he was put upon his Defence.
Prisoner. I did not buy these Goods, I had them of one John Johnson, who Trades over Sea; I met this Man one Day, and I went with him to the White Swan Ale-house at Holborn-Bridge, and he ask'd me to get him 7 Guineas upon them; I carry'd them to Skreen's for him, and she produced Grace Adkins.
Constable. He told me he bought them of Johnson, and that he had bought Goods of him, and sold them several Times.
Mr. Movillion. The Prisoner was a Servant
 to another Printer, and he and his Brother went suddenly from their Places upon such another Affair.
Q. Have you no Body here from the Swan, where you say this Johnson deliver'd you the Goods?
Prisoner. No.
Constable. Why, he told me himself, that he knew the Goods were not finish'd.
Skreen. Adkins told me the Prisoner offer'd to sell her 2 Gowns at 5 s. a Piece, and that she had bid him 4 s. 6 d. The Prisoner was then in Company with us, - we were all drinking Tea, and in Discourse, Grace said, she would have the first Man that asked her the Question. The Prisoner asked her if she would have him? Upon my Faith (says she) I will; upon which they both went to Merlin's-Cave at Charing-Cross, and there the Prisoner tore off enough Linnen to make her a Gown, and made her a Present of it, to bind the Bargain. I have seen several Gowns upon the People's Backs, which Grace Adkins had sold for him.
The Court allow'd the Prisoner 2 Hours more to send for his Witnesses; after which, Mr. Norton, and Mr. Lutwych appeared.
Lutwych. The Prisoner's Sister gave me Money for Councel and Subpoena's against to Morrow.
Norton. I am the Prisoner's Father's Agent, and the Prisoner used to bring me a Guinea now and then to send to his Father, for he said he thought it his Duty to help him in his Need, as long as he was able, and I commended him for it. The Prisoner has work'd 3 Years in Whitster's Grounds, and I never heard ill of him before.
Lutwych. I gave Subpenae's to Mr. Dottery and his Wife, but I did not imagine his Trial would have been 'till to Morrow
Mr. Movillion. Mr. Dottery is the Prisoner's Brother-in-Law, and he told me positively, that he should not care to appear at the Old-Bailey for him.

                  Jarvis 
               



            . I am Servant to Mr. Watson a Printer, the Prisoner was under me, and he behaved well till latterly: 'tis 3 Years ago since he worked with me first. About the Time that I complained the Grounds were robb'd, he went away, and never bid me God b'w'y.
Q. What was the Cause of his going away?
Jarvis. I don't know.
Q. Upon your Oath did not Mr. Watson turn away 2 Servants for being Acquaintances and Accomplices of his?
Jarvis. Yes, he did.
A Woman. I know the Prisoner to be an honest Man; I have known him some Years, and I never knew any Thing but good Behaviour by him.
Q. Are you any Relation of the Prisoner's?
Woman. Yes, I am his Sister. He bore a very good Character, both in the Country and here; Mr. Dottery would have appeared for him, but he's not at Home.

Jacob Kendall I charge the Prisoners with breaking open a Door, and robbing me of a Pewter Bason and Dish, and other Things, between 3 and 4 in the Morning; they had moved 3 Sauce-pans, 2 Stew-pans, and a Tea-kettle, in order to carry them off.

Then he pretended to be making Water, within a Yard of the Door: I pushed it open and saw the Stew-pans and Sauce-pans, and the Tea-kettle, all ready to be taken off. I saw nothing of Harrison, but Howard I took particular Notice of, and observ'd that his Hands and Face were crock'd and black'd.

The Morning he was robb'd I was up at Work, and as I was opening my Window, I saw the Prisoner Harrison at Mr. Kendall's Wall, with something like a Bundle under his Arm. He pretended (when he saw me) to be making water too, so I went to my Work, but in about half an Hour, my Wife bid me go and see what was the Matter at Mr. Kendall's; when I came there, I found they had got Howard; and Harrison coming in, to enquire what the Disturbance was, I told the People that I had seen him about half an Hour ago, with a Sack full of something under his Arm; upon which Mr. Kendall detained him with the other.
Q. The Things that were remov'd, and lay ready to be carry'd off, - where did they stand over Night?
Kendall. In my Wash-house. We found the Things again which they had carry'd off, in King Harry's Yard, not far from my House.
Sanders. While I was telling Mr. Kendal that I had seen Harrison with a Sack under his Arm, some People came in with one which they said they had found in Maudlin's Rents, in a Dust Cart, and the Goods in it proved to be Mr. Kendall's.
Prisoner Howard. I know nothing of the Man's Goods being stolen: I was going to the Hermitage, and stopping at Mr. Kendall's Door to make Water, a Man rushed out of the House, and went by me.
Bundey. When I saw Howard turn as if he intended to make Water, there was no Body at all passed him.
Howard. As to my Hands and Face being crock'd, I had been mending a Hole in a Porridge-pot for a Woman, who is here in Court, and she gave me 6 d. for doing it.
C. This is a notable Evidence; as it happens she cannot swear you was at another Place.


                  Margaret 
                  Cannon 
               



            . Howard (the Prisoner) liv'd with me about 3 or 4 Months, and kept very good Hours. The Morning this Thing happen'd, I let him out; the Watchman (as I shut the Door after him) went - past 3 o'Clock? I heard no more of him 'till I heard he was in Trouble.
Q. How far is your House from Mr. Kendall's?
Cannon. I live in Church-Lane, Whitechapel. Mr. Kendall's is about a quarter of a Mile from thence.
Howard. There is the Woman whose Porrige-pot I mended, and crock'd my Hands and Face in doing it.


                  Eliz 
                  Vaughan 
               



            . I have known the Prisoner Howard since Whitsuntide, and know no Harm of him.
Howard. Ask her, my Lord, if I did not mend her Porrige-pot that very Night? - 'Twas an Iron Porrige-pot, and I had 6 d. of her for mending it.
Vaughan. I am upon Oath, and can't say any Thing I don't know, - no, - upon my Oath, I know nothing at all of it.

                  Pickering 
               



            . Howard serv'd his Time with me very well: he buys and sells Pewter; - he has dealt in Pewter
 a pretty while.
C. That seems to be true: 'Tis sworn upon him here:


                  Tho 
                  Colcott 
               



            . I know no Harm of him; only this - he will get Drunk and bring himself into Trouble.
Q. Does not he deal in Pewter?
Colcott. I don't know what he deals in, - not I.
Harrison's Defence.
I never was guilty of such an enormous Crime in all my Life. I am a Seaman
, and I came here in the Contrivance, Capt. Franklin. The Night this Thing happen'd, I had been drinking at the Newcastle upon Tine, at the Hermitage, with some Seamen who were to help me to a Birth; I came from thence past Mr. Kendall's Door, and seeing the Hubbub, I just put my Head in to see what was the Matter, and so they seized me.
Q. To Sanders. Was not that the Man you saw with the Bundle under his Arm?
Sanders. Upon my Oath 'tis the same Person.
Kendall. Harrison says now, he is a Sea-faring Man; when he was before the Justice, he said he was a regular bred Parson, and had worn Canonical Robes. They both said then, they lived in Petticoat-Lane, and had liv'd there 3 Months.
Harrison Why, I served my Time indeed at Sea, but I was brought up and educated at Eaton College.

            . On the 21st of September, between five and six in the Morning, I heard a Noise at my Master Heweys Door in Aldermanbury


, so I jump'd out of Bed, and opened the Door in my Shirt; the old Gentleman at the Bar was at the Door, but seeing me open it, he was going off with all Expedition; I resolved to go after him, and intended to have laid hold of the Knob on the Outside of the Door to pull it too. - but the Knob was gone. As he made off I heard something rattle in his Pocket, so I followed him, and asked him what he wanted at my Master's Door? He said he wanted nothing; but I laid hold of him by the two Shoulders and gave him a Shake or two, and though he is an old Man, yet I can assure you he made a stout Resistance before he submitted. Then he begged I would let him go, but I told him he was a Villain, and that if he would not come back with me I would use him ill; I was obliged to be expeditious with him, because I had left the Street Door o'jar to follow him, and I was uneasy and afraid some of his Gang might get into the House while I was disputing with him; therefore I gave him another good Shake, and while I shook him, I saw the Brass Knob which he had wrenched from my Master's Door, drop from him on the Ground; I saw it fall, but I did not care to stoop for it, for I found him a stout Fellow, and was afraid, he might either get away, or knock me down while I was taking it up; so I brought him back to my Master's Door, and he run himself up, over the Window of our Small Beer Cellar, which is covered with an Iron Grate. While he stood over this Window he dropped this Instrument, - here's a little Hook, - with which he hung it to his Girdle under his Great Coat. I saw it fall from him, and was exasperated. I told him that he was mistaken - that Instrument could not fall through the Bars; and I swore I would use him ill if he resisted me, or refused to come into the House; so I got him in, and called out to one of my Fellow-Servants. Upon examining his Pockets we found - all these Brass Knobs upon him, this in particular is my Master Hewey's, and I saw him drop it; I did not stay to take it up myself, but a Carpenter coming by and seeing me engaged with the Old Gentleman, he bid me hold the Old Thief fast, and he would bring me the Knob, which he accordingly did, and told me if I wanted help, he would assist me. When we had secured the Old Man, we sent for a Constable, and as soon as we could, we carried him before Alderman Brocas, who asked him how he came by that Collection of Knobs? (there was a Brass Knocker or two among them) The Prisoner told him he found them as he went down to Thames-street, he found them in a Parcel of Straw. This very Knob I swear to, - 'tis my Master's, I saw it drop from him, and I'll pick it out from five hundred.
Prisoner. As for that Instrument I know nothing of it, it was standing at the Door before I came there. I have been Lame these Thirty Years, and have a Fistula in Ano upon me - That Man swears to the Knob, - why the Knobs, my Lord, are all alike, and how can he swear to one in particular so positively? I found them all under a Bench. And now, - as to the Instrument, - he says 'twas hook'd to my Girdle, - why, he held both my Hands, - then how could I dropt it?
Jury. Did you see the Instrument drop from him, or did you see it only on the Ground?
Oscullin. When I had got him over the Cellar Window, I easied his Right Hand, and perceiv'd him immediately busy with it. - I actually saw it drop upon the Grate, and told him, that it would not fall thro' the Bars, and that I would stoop and take it up for him.

            . This Letter I pick'd up in the Area of Mrs. Alderson's Yard, which is next the Street, in St. Mary-ax. It was fasten'd up with three Bits of Sealing-wax, which were dabb'd upon it, and wrapp'd up in a Sheet of Brown Paper.
(The Letter was read.)
Directed to Mrs Alderson.
Madam, Please to lay 50 Guineas under the Stone between the Water. plug and your Rails, before your Kitchen Window, close by the Steps, near your own Door. Let it be left there, on Wednesday next in the Night, and I and my Comrades will come for it. If you fail leaving it, according to Direction, the first Time you go to the Play, we will shoot you in your Coach, as you come Home; we all know the Time of your coming Home, so we shall make no more Words, but leave the Money if you value your Life; if you set any Watch, we will Murder them and you too. Do as you think fit, but if you value your Life, and your Son's Life, leave the Money, and you shall receive no Harm from us.
Mrs. Briar. This Letter was found the Day before Michaelmas-day: About a Fortnight after, the Prisoner was taken up, and when he was carry'd to Sir William Billers's Office, he sent for my Mistress; she did not care to go to him, so I went and desir'd him to make a Confession, if he knew any Thing of the Letters. He told me, he would say Nothing, but to my Mistress her self; I told him he might write his Mind to her, and accordingly he took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and went into another Room and wrote this Letter. I saw him take a Peice of Wax, out of his Pocket, and dabb'd it on the Letter, and fasten'd it down with his Thumb. The sealing this Letter, was so like those found in our Yard, that it immediately put me in Mind of them. This was the Letter he sent by me to my Mistress.
Honoured Madam,
No Man did induce me to do this, but the Man at the White-Swan, who promis'd me a Reward, so I like a Fool took his Advice, and I ask your Pardon for this great Fault, which I acknowledge with all my Heart. It was he that did throw the Letters into the Yard at your House. Do not send me to New-gate, but any where else where you please.
I am your most humble Servant to command,

Mrs. Brian. The second Time I went to him, he desir'd my Mistress not to send him to Newgate, and he would come and make a Confession against the Man, whenever she pleas'd; I told him he had done too many bad Things, for my Mistress to release him; and that the Spoon and the Candlestick which were taken from him by the Constable, were my Mistresses. He own'd his taking them, and that he put them into his Pocket to sell that very Day.

            . I took up this 2d Letter in my Mistresses Yard, facing the Window, the 2d of Oct. wrapp'd up, and ty'd in this Piece of Blanket.
(The Letter was read)
To Mrs. Alderson, '' Madam,
Since you deceiv'd us we will try you one other Time, and we will come some Night next Week, if you leave the Money, it will be well for your self and Family: if you leave it not, we will do as we told you in the first Letter. We give you no ill Words, nor bad Language, and it lies in your own Power to make yourself both easy and happy Think not to escape us. if you leave not the Money, for we shall light of you when you little think of it.

             came to me at Sir William Billers's Office, and told me if I would make a Confession, my Mistress would forgive me. I own I wrote the Letter she carried from me to her.
Mrs. Brian. I only said, if he would make a Confession, he would save his own Life, and he told me he would confess to no one but her self.

            . I was sent by my Mistress to see for the Prisoner one Day, and I found him with Thurston at the White Swan in Leaden hall street. I told him my Mistress wanted him; he charged me to take no Notice who was with him, and Thurston said, pray don't; but I came Home and told my Lady that the Prisoner was with Thurston, upon which she was very much frighted. After this I went to call a Constable; he was at a Barber's and there I found Thurston; they were talking of the Thing I believe, for I heard Thurston say, he would not do such a Fact for 10,000 l.
Mrs. Alderson. I had an Information that the Man at the White-Swan had taken up the Stone after the first Letter was found; upon which, I sent for him, and he own'd he came that Night, and look'd under the Stone for the Money; but he told me he was drunk, or else he should not have done it. This gave me however, a bad Opinion of him, and I order'd my Servants never to go to his House to drink. About a Fortnight after, the Prisoner was abroad, and I sent my Footman to look for him, he brought me Word he was drinking with Thurston at his House. When the Prisoner came in, I ask'd him who he had been drinking with? He told me he had been with one whose Name I did not know. I let him know that the Footman inform'd me he had been with Thurston, the Prisoner replied, - then he's a Rascal for his Pains, - if he had not told you, I never would. In a few Days after this I discharg'd him, and when he was gone, I look'd over some Bills of his, and imagined the Hand-writing of some of them bore a Resemblance with the Letters; upon which I enquir'd after him again, and he was taken up.
Thurston. The first Time that ever I saw the Prisoner in my Life, was when the Lady sent for me to her House; he was then call'd into the Room to speak to Mr. Mispley about these Letters. They ask'd me if I had not search'd the Place for the Money? I said, I was that Night disguised in Liquor, and a Gentleman being at the House and saying there had been Threatning Letters sent to Mrs. Alderson, and that there was a Watch set, both within, and without the House, I had the Curiosity to go down to see how the Watch stood: I own'd I went down, and that I saw no Watch, and that I did kick up the Stone. At that Time I did not know where the Lady liv'd, nor her Name, but I did kick up the Stone indeed. On the Sunday after, I went to an Alehouse, the 3 Crowns to enquire for the Prisoner. I saw him, and asked him how his Lady did, and whether she was easy, or had any Mistrust of me. When the Lady's Footman came to enquire for the Prisoner at my House, I don't remember my ordering him to deny he was with me, for I took no Observation of the Thing. I never rested Night nor Day since this unfortunate Affair, and as I desired the Thing should be found out, I desired the Prisoner to let me know, if any body should be taken up about it.

Upon the second Indictment, Mr. Hunter, the Constable depos'd, that he took the Prisoner about 9 in the Morning; that as he was following him, he observ'd him to shuffle something into his Breeches; upon searching him they found the Things mention'd in his Breeches, which he told them he had taken from his Wife, in order to sell them.

Mrs. Allen. I live in Buckler's-bury



; the 22d of October my House was broke open, between 1 and 3 in the Night, and I was robb'd of the Things mention'd in the Indictment; the Watchman knock'd us up, because he found the Door opens The Prisoner had been my Servant; I keep a Tavern
, and he was my Errand-boy
. I lost a dozen of Table-cloths, a dozen of Napkins, 6 Handkerchiefs, Cambrick and Muslin, 6 gilt Tea-spoons and a Strainer, a Velvet Hood, and a Scarlet Cloth Cloak, and 4 Aprons. The Linnen was in a Place that was like a Seat, to sit upon, and I believe they could not have been found, but by Some-body that knew the House. He had been gone away from me 3 Weeks or a Month before I was robb'd. The Goods were advertis'd the next Day, and the Prisoner was taken up on Suspicion, and carry'd before Justice Midford, where he confess'd the Fact. He was ask'd to sign his Confession, but he refus'd to do that. The Substance of it was, that he and 
               
                  Richard 
                  Williams 
               



            , and another, (whose Name I have forgot) came in through the Window; that the Pin not being fast, he took it out, and then threw up the Sash; that they then got into the House, and took the Goods, which they carry'd to several Persons Houses, who knew them to be stole. I employ'd the Constable only in the Affair, and he brought me some of my Linnen again. The Whole of it, I believe, is mine, but Part of it I can positively swear to.


                  Hen 
                  Mold 
               



            , Constable. On the First of November, or the latter end of October, I found the Prisoner at a naughty House in the Cole-yard in St. Giles's. I brought him away, but he would not speak 'till I got him to my House. I ask'd him if he knew 
               
                  Dick 
                  Williams 
               



            ? He shook his Head, and said, yes, I know him to my Sorrow; 'tis he that has brought me to all this; and he desir'd me to go back to the House where I took him, for he was sure that Williams and Humphries would come there. I went there to look for them, but one 
               
                  Sue 
                  Chapman 
               



             had given them Notice to get out of the Way. The Prisoner inform'd me, that his Companions were to be paid for the Goods that were dispos'd of at one Harbin's in Leicester-street, by Hockley in the Hole, but they never came there for the Money, nor did we find any of the Things at Harbin's House, but he help'd us to some of the Linnen, a piece of black Tabby, and some of the Stockings again. The Prisoner Carter own'd before Justice Midford that she carry'd the Goods to Harbin, to sell for these Men.


                  John 
                  Davis 
               



             gave an Account, that he was Mrs. Allen's Drawer, and that the Windows and Doors were fast over Night; that he lost 4 Guineas, some Silver, and 18 d. in Half-pence, out of a Cupboard which was nail'd up in the Yard, and likewise a pair of Pumps. That the Prisoner confess'd he got thro' the Window, and broke open the Cupboard, and had pawn'd the Pumps.


                  William 
                  Satchwell 
               



            . I left two dozen of Silk Stockings, and two pieces of Tabby at Mrs. Allen's, which she inform'd me were stole with her Goods. I believe these to be the same which I lost.
Hen. Mold. The Prisoner told me, that if it had not been for him, his two Companions would have murder'd the Maids, and the Mistress too.
Harbin. The Goods were brought to Sue Chapman's House, and there I saw them. The Prisoner Carter brought them from thence to my House, and desir'd me to dispose of them. I was to get what I could for them, and was to be paid for my Trouble. The two Prisoners, and Williams and Humphries, coming daily after me for the Money, I got one Mrs. Stokes, who is run away, to help to sell them. I receiv'd 4 l. from her, and gave the two Prisoners some part of the Money; some part I kept my self, and 5 s. Stokes had for her Trouble. I ask'd the Prisoner Cook how he came by the Goods, and he told me they were safe enough, for they got them 10 Miles off. The Monday after Lord Mayor's Day, Cook and Williams, and Humphries were quarrelling at an Alehouse, and Cook said if they had not been Fools, they might have gone up Stairs, and have got 150 l. One of them reply'd, we should then have disturb'd them, upon which Cook said, if they had made any Noise, we would have blown all their Brains out. I dispos'd of the Spoons, and the Prisoner had his Share of the Money at the Black-Bull upon Saffron Hill.
Prisoner Carter. Ask him how he can have the Assurance to say the Goods were brought to my Room without his Knowledge? He and Sue Chapman brought them to me, to look at, and I fastned my Door with the Poker.

Legg. I was going past the Fleet-Market


 about half an Hour after 7 at Night, and the Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket, and took my Handkerchief. I seiz'd him, but he beat me, and ask'd me if I had a Mind to rob him. I saw him by the Light of the Market, and am positive he is the Man.

            . I was in the Country when the Spoon was taken; when I came Home my Servant told me she suspected the Prisoner had got it. I went to her in St. James's Workhouse, and asked her how she could take the Spoon? She told me she was drunk when she did it, and own'd she took it from the Dresser in the Kitchen. I took her before Justice Lambert, and he committed her to Tothill fields Bridewell As we were carrying her thither, she told me she had pawn'd it at Mrs. Martin's in Peter-street. I found it there; and paid 6 s. and three half-pence for it again. The Prisoner liv'd by blacking Shoes, and sweeping the Streets
, - she was not my Servant.
Prisoner. The Prosecutor condescended to let me pawn it.
Richardson. No; I did not. I told her I knew a Gentleman that was acquainted with Justice Lambert, and if she would let me know where the Spoon was, I would get him to do her what Service I could; upon which she told me where I might find it.

. I suspected a parcel of Boys, and took the Prisoner up on Suspicion; another of them is made an Evidence. I took one Southall first, and he told me, that my Check was sold to the Prisoner Correl, in Thieving-lane

I went with the Constable to Correl's House, and ask'd him for the 2 pieces of Check, he deny'd them, and said he had no such Goods; but at last he told us we should have them, and bid his Wife fetch them. She went with the Constable, and he brought them to me.

Then he went in and took 2 Bundles of Check: I took it from him and gave it to Southall. He went in a second Time and took out a Bundle of Stockings; we carried all to Correl's House. Chap was with us, and went out with us upon this Business. Smith and Alexander lodged in Correl's House; he gave us but 5 s. for the two Peices of Linnen and we were obliged to carry off the Stockings from his House, because Southall having offer'd a pair of them to a Soldier, at a Cook's-Shop, next Door to Correl's, he stopp'd them, and we were afraid of being pursu'd. Alexander receiv'd the Money from Correl for the Check, and we were to have our Shares the next Morning, but the Constable came and took me out of Bed. Correl us'd to buy the Goods we brought him.

I said, if it was in my Power, I would do him what Service I could. Upon this he carry'd me to a Cockloft, on the Top of his House, and there he grop'd about, for a quarter of an Hour. I bid him not sham with me, I must (I said) know where they were. At last he bid his Wife fetch them, and she brought me these Peices of Check.

Dor. Elliot. Last Sunday was se'nnight, I work out about 8 o'Clock in the Morning to Church; and when I came Home, People met me and told me I had been robb'd. I came Home as fast as I could, and found the street Door lock'd. I open'd it, and ran up into my Chamber; there I found the Lock upon a Box where I keep my little Substance, quite broke off. I had six Guineas, ten Shillings and Six-pence in Silver, a silver Tankard, a Cocoa shell-Cup, with a silver Foot, and a silver Ring, in this Box, when I went to Church; but when I came Home, - they were all gone; the Prisoner was taken before I got Home, and the Things were found upon him. When he was before the Justice, he own'd he did the Fact, and that he had taken the Tankard, the Cup and the Ring; and as to the Money, he said he had but 1 Guinea and 10 s. 6 d. but he said he knew where the other five Guineas were. I knew nothing of the Prisoner before.

            . I am Constable, and was sent for the 5th of this Month, about 11 o'Clock to take Charge of the Prisoner. The Things mention'd in the Indictment, I found upon him, except the 6 Guineas. These are the Things.
Elliot. And they are all of them mine.

            . The Tankard is mine; I gave it my Sister Elliot to take Care of it for me.
Mr. Dobey. I carry'd the Prisoner before Mr. Justice Phillips; he own'd taking of the Plate, the Ring, and the half Guinea in Silver; but he had some Partners (he said) concerned with him who took the Gold.

                  Drummer 
               



            . On Sunday Feb. 5th in the Fore-noon, I was sitting in my House, next Door to Dame Elliot's, and saw the Prisoner cross the Way toward her Door. He had a dirty Canvas er his Arm. I heard him lift up the Latch of her Door, so I sent my Brother (a Boy, about 10 Years old) to tell him, there was no Body at Home; the Boy came back and said, there was no one at her Door, nor in the Street; while I was making a Noise at the Boy, my Sister who was up Stairs, making the Bed, call'd to me, and said somebody was in Dame Elliot's Room; I bid her make hast and come down; she did so, and saw him. This was between 10 and 11 o'Clock; I am sure he's the Man.


                  Mary 
                  Drummer 
               



            . I was above Stairs making the Bed, and hearing the Noise in Dame Elliot's House, I call'd down to my Brother, and asked him if she was at Home? He told me no, and bid me come down Stairs. As I came down, I heard the Prisoner lock the Door, and saw him go into the Alley. One of his Pockets was stuff'd out, and he had a Bundle under his Arm. After he came out of the Alley, he ran down the Lane, as hard as he could. I told my Brother, - there he ran. About three quarters of an Hour after, I saw him again, and said hold of him I took him; and asked him how he could be so base, to rob the old Woman? He told me, he had met her in Stepney Fields, and she had given him the Key, to carry up a Bag of Iron Nails; she deals in Iron. However, I took him by the Shoulder, and carried him to my own Door; he begg'd Leave to go into the House, because the Mob rose upon him. When I had got him into the House Mr. Jackson got a Constable.

Yes, said she, and describ'd the Man to me, and told me what sort of a Coat he had on. While we were talking, the Prisoner went by, and we ran after him. We ask'd him what Business he had to rob Neighbour Ellot's House? He said he said he met her in Stepney Fields, and she gave him the Key of her Door to carry in a Bag of Nails. I told him she did not use to buy Iron on Sundays, - so we carry'd him to Drummer's House.

Mr. Holland. I keep a Goldsmith's Shop
 at Bishop-Gate


. On Monday Afternoon last, the Prisoner came into my Shop, and asked to see some Seals. I took out a Drawer, and shew'd him. 5 or 6 Doxen. He look'd over them, and asked the Price of one, and another. At last he bid Money for one, and pull'd out 2 s. with his left Hand. I thought I heard a jingling of something more than Money, and watching his Hand, I perceived one of my Seals with his 2 s. I observed him carefully, and saw him take up another. What will you have for this, says he? I told him he had got one in his Hand already. No, he had not he said, and open'd his Hand, and there was nothing but the 2 s. I told him I was sure he had it, and desired to look into his Hat. He pulled off his Hat and Wig, and open'd his Breast, telling me I might search him. I came round the Counter to search him, and in his Pocket I found these 5 Seals; I had no sooner taken them from him, but he ran out of Doors; I got hold of him again at the Kennel, and in struggling with him I tore his Coat up to his Back. My Man and I with much ado, got him back to the Shop, and sent for a Constable to take Charge of him. These are the Seals, they are mine, and some of them I have had these 3 or 4 Years.
Prisoner. I was vastly in Liquor; I never knew I had any of them, - I was vastly much in Liquor.

             gave exactly the same Account and deposed farther, that he was not in Liquor, of which he was convinced by the Resistance he made when he was taken.
Prisoner. My Lord I know nothing at all of it, - I was vastly in Liquor; I have People to prove that Liquor disorders me vastly, and I live in the Neighbourhood with a Gentleman that entrusts me with a vast Number of Things. The People of the Goal know I was vastly drunk when I was committed.

John. I am his Brother in Law; I have known him about 4 Years, and have seen him - not much in Liquor, but when he is - I am always glad to get out of his Company. As to his Character, - I nothing of that.
Jones. I am a Porter in Borough Market work for his Wife; I have known him 12 or 13 Months. I have heard that he deals in Callamancoes, Muslins, and Handkerchief - not old Handkerchief, - but new ones.

Mr. Dodson. I live in the Borrough As to the Prisoner I know no Good of him; his general Character is but very indifferent, and I desire to be excused from entering into Particulars.
Prisoner. This is because they call me a Molly, and say I am more like a Woman than a Man, and how can I help my Face?

Mary Kinshillug. The Prisoner came into my House, and laid she was just come off the Water; she call'd for a Quartern of Brandy, complaining she was very cold. I was drinking Tea, so I invited her to drink a Dish to warm her; I got her some Toast and Butter, and made very much of her, tho' she was a Stranger. In our Conversation, she told me she had a Brother who was a Holland Trader, and for my Civility she would make me a Present of a quarter of a Pound of Tea. Thus we passed away an Hour or two, and then she asked me, if I had a Room in the House to spare; for if I had her Brother (she said) should make use of it. I shewed her my Dining-Room above Stairs, and she order'd a good Fire to be made in it against her Brother came. The next Day she came again, and told me she was a Seventh Daughter, and had studied the Planets, and that there was hidden Treasure in my Cellar, - (but 'twas she found, the Treasure, - and I lost it.) When I heard there was Treasure in my Cellar, I told her I wish'd she could find it, - if she did, she should take what she pleased out of it for herself. Why, won't you believe me, said she, I said I could hardly think there was any; but she fell down on her Knees, and wish'd bitter Wishes if it was not true; and on Account of this Treasure, she directed me to put all the Money an valuable Things I had in the House together in a Napkin, and lay it on the Table. I did so, and wrapp'd up 16 Tea Spoons, a large Spoon, a Gold Ring, 8 Guineas, and 10 s. in Silver. Then she took a Pound of Bay Salt and a Pewter Spoon, and wrapp'd the Spoon and the Salt up together. I was call'd down to a Customer, and when I went up Stairs again, all my Things were gone, and she too. I never had any of them again. I am positive the Prisoner is the Person that robb'd me; tho' she is dirty now, she was clean then. I am sure she gave me so aching a Heart, that I could have remember'd her 20 Years. I could have remember'd she was with me 2 Days, a conjuring me out of my Senses.
- Gray. The Prisoner is the Person who was there 2 Days: I was at the Door when she went out with Kirshillug's Money and Goods, when she was out of Doors, she turn'd back and desir'd me to keep a good Fire in my Room, for she was coming back again with a great quantity of Tea in 5 Minutes, and she would put it in my Room, because she did not care (she said) to trust my Landlady Kinshillug. She was call'd out of the Dining Room from the Prisoner, to give Change to a Customer below; and in the mean Time she ran away.
Kirshillug. There was no Soul in the Dining-Room but she and I talking about the hidden Treasure, I left her but a very little while, but when I went up Stairs again she was gone, and all my Money too.
- Galloway. I saw Kingshillug carry her Spoons and Things up Stairs, and I am positive there was no one but she and the Prisoner in the Dining-Room. I saw her come running down Stairs (after the Prisoner was gone off,) - crying out, she had lost all her Money, &c.

            , Apr. 11
.
Mrs. Rowley. I was last Tuesday to hear the Rehearsal at St. Paul's, and when it was over, I endeavour'd to avoid the Crowd, by going through Cannon Alley, in Pater-noster-Row


. In the Alley I was stopp'd by 2 Men, who push'd me close against the Prisoner. Before I could get away, I felt her lift up the Side of my Hoop, and put her Hand into my Pocket. This Gentleman (Mr. Addy) was looking at the same out of his Window, and call'd out to me, - Madam, your Pocket is pick'd. I put my Hand into my Pocket, and found I had lost 8 s. 6 d. I brought 11 s. 6 d. out with me, but I had no more than a Half-Crown and a Six-pence left: Mr. Addy told me he knew the Woman, and if I would step into his House, he would go and take her; and he went out, and took her accordingly. She was carry'd before the Lord Mayor, but she was not search'd; for my Lord imagin'd she had her Receivers about her, and that it would be to no Purpose to search her. I felt her Hand, and cry'd at the same Time - What, are you picking Pockets here!
Mr. Addy. I was looking out of my Window to see the Crowd at the Rehearsal, and had observ'd the Prisoner, with the Assistance of her 2 Fellows, to have pick'd a great many Pockets that Morning: But this Lady was robb'd under my very Window. I observ'd the 2 Men to shove the Gentlewoman against the Prisoner, and saw her put her Hand into her Pocket, and afterwards clap something into her own. I was positive she took Money out of this Gentlewoman's Pocket, and put it into her own; so I told her, if she would Prosecute her, I would take her, for I knew her. She had been an Hour and Half, or 2 Hours, about the Alley that Morning, and had pick'd a great many Pockets.
Prisoner. Then why did not you call out before?
Mr. Addy. Because that was at a Distance - She was hurrying and picking Pockets as fast as she could, at a Distance; but this was under my Window.


                  Mary 
                  Read 
               



            . I was with Mrs. Rowley at this Time. The Prisoner and her Fellows stopp'd me first, and held me for some Time; but I had emptied my Pockets before I came out, so they let me go, and stopp'd her; she was close behind me. I heard Mr. Addy call out to Mrs. Rowley, and tell her, the Prisoner had pick'd her Pocket.
Prisoner. I was in a Shop when that Man came up and accused me, and I offer'd to be searched. I told the People I had 7 s. 6 d. and a Guinea in my Pocket, and if I had any more, 'twas the Lady's
Mr. Ashly With Relation to her asserting he was in the Shop when she was seiz'd, 'tis false. At the very Time he seiz'd her, she was going to pick Doctor Best's Lady's Pocket, and I call'd out to her. I have known her for a Pick-pocket these 5 Years, and saw her pick 20 Pockets that Day. She is so well known, that I could have brought a Dozen People to have prov'd this, if I had imagin'd it would been necessary.
Mr. Addy. Her Janizaries have been with me since she was taken up, and offer'd me Money to keep out of the Way, that the Thing might be dropp'd before the Grand Jury.

, Apr. 9

John Robins. Last Monday Night I was going up Holborn and met that Gentlewoman there, and another with her. So Countryman, said they, where are you going? Why Home, says I, where should I go? Go along with us, says one of them. What should I go along with you for, I can't Kiss you? Will you bung your Eyes, said I? Yes, if I pleas'd they said; and so they carry'd me to one Mrs. Wests House, - I don't know what Street 'tis in, not I, - I am but a stranger here. But that woman there, and I, went in and drank; I saw none but she and the Landlady. When we had drank together a while, I call'd for the Landlady to give me Change for the Liquor, but I never got my Change of her; when she came in, she said to the Prisoner, bilk him - make the best of him; so we drank together, and she grew mighty familiar, - more familiar than I thought she should be, - stand further off says I, - I am afraid of you. Presently after this the Landlady came in, and put out the Candles, and pushing me out of Doors, I had like to have broke my Shins. When I was out of the House they run me up against the Wall of a Brew-House, and left me. I found my Money was gone, so I ran roaring and hallooing out for a Watchman, and at last a Watchman found me, and carry'd me Home, Next Morning I was a little uneasy about my Money, and I told the Folks how I had been serv'd, and that I had lost 9 l. 3 s. What's her Name said they? Her Name, says I, - why I don't know her Name, - only they call'd her Peg. O! says one of them, we can help you to Peg again, and so they carry'd me from one House to to'ther House, and at last we found Peg at a Pawnbroker's redeeming her Cloaths out of Pawn, with my Money I suppose. I ran for a Warrant to take her up, and when I return'd, the People told me she had confess'd her taking my Money, and she had return'd a Guinea and a half, a 36 Shilling-piece, and Half-a-Crown. When she was before the Justice, she own'd the Fact again, and upon searching her, we found another Guinea in her Snuff-Box, and 13s in her Pocket, which she own'd was Part of my Money. Some of the Gold (she said) she had chang'd to redeem her Things, and three Guineas her Landlady took from her, for her Share. She said she took it out of my Fob-Pocket, - I don't know how she did it, not I, - 'twas in my Fob, in a green silk Wallet. I have no more to say, - not I.
Prisoner. Do you swear I pick'd your Pocket?
Robins. Yes; and you know you did. I did not miss it 'till they push'd me out of the House. There was none but she in my Company; the Landlady only brought in the Liquor, and I felt for my Money and had it as I went into the House.
Geo Thompson. The Prisoner was brought to my House, by some People, to whom she had return'd the 36 Shilling-piece, with a Guinea and half, and Half a Crown; the Money was paid in my Backside, - my Back-side in the Yard. While she was before the Justice we found 13 s. in her Pocket, and a Guinea in her Snuff-Box. She own'd she took the Money she is charg'd with out of his Pocket; and put the rest into it again.
Robins. No; she did not take all, - for I had 14 l. in my Pocket. She took what she pleas'd, and left me the rest in the Wallet.
Prisoner. Where did you go to see what Money was lost?
Robins. To my Inn. I could not tell my Money over in the Street, - in the Dark.
Prisoner. Was you asleep in the House?
Robins. Asleep, - no; nor I was not asleep.
Prisoner. Was you drunk or sober?
Robins. Sober - why I was not very sober - nor I was not very fuddled.
Prisoner to the Constable. Was he drunk or sober?
Thompson. He was drunk. She own'd she took the Money (before the Justice) out of his Pocket, and said nothing in her Excuse.
Prisoner. Did you give me the Purse to tell the Money over?
Robins. No - no - no - I did not like you so well. I was only drinking there - that's all: she was greater with me than I desir'd. We had 3 Bottles of Ale, and I paid the Reckoning - 3 Shillings and 6 Pence

                  Stollard 
               



            . The Prisoner confess'd the Fact in my hearing; but she said the Countryman and she had 3 Bottles of Ale, and 2 half Pints of Gin. She said, her Landlady charg'd her to bilk him, when she put them together.
Prisoner. How was it possible for me to put the Purse into your Fob again?
Robins. How was it possible? Why how was it possible for you to take it out? We sat upon the Bed together; but I don't know any Business she had with my Fob.
Prisoner. You can't swear but your Money might drop out of your Fob.
Robins. Can't I! - yes, but I can tho'.

             I have nothing to say, but that the Goods were my Property, and were stole out of my House in Noble-street


, on the 25th of March. There was about 22 Dozen of Silk Loopes, and 8 Gross of Thread Loopes, a Pound of Thread, a Check Apron, and two Bandboxes. I saw them all in the back Room below Stairs, on Saturday the 25th of March, and on Monday following, we miss'd them. Upon Enquiry, I found that this Witness (Elizabeth Haydon) knew something of the Affair, so I had her before Mr. Justice Polson, and she discover'd the Prisoner and his Wife. Thro' her Means we took him; and we found some of the Goods at Mr. Compton's ot the White-Hart in Pater-noster-row, 12 or 13 Dozen of them were sold there. When Cockran was taken up, he own'd he had had the Goods, but he told us, he had them from one Bolingbroke and his Wife. Two Gross he said were pawn'd, he could not tell where, and the rest he deliver'd to Eliz. Haydon to dispose of for him. Part of the Goods which were found in Pater noster-row, were carry'd before my Lord-Mayor, and were put into the Hands of Nettlefold the Constable.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Haydon 
               



            . The Prisoner sent for me on the Thursday before Good-Friday to his Lodging; I went up Stairs, and he shew'd me a great quantity of Silk and thread Loopes. There were 16 dozen of Silk Loopes, and 6 gross and better of thread Loopes. He told me if I would dispose of them for him, he would satisfy me for my Trouble. I saw no Banboxes, nor any check Apron. I ask'd him whose they were? He said they were his own, and he ty'd them up in a Handkerchief, and his Wife and I went to Mr. Crouch's Shop, (he is dead, and Mr. Compton keeps it now) Mr Compton would not have bought them if he had not known me. He knew me, and bought 12 or 13 Dozen of Silk and Thread Loopes together, and the Prisoner had the Money. 'Twas either 14 or 15 s. that we had for them, I can't tell which. I told him I never did sell such Goods for the Money, but having Cockran's Consent, I took the Money and gave it to him, at the Post-Boy in Black-Fryar's. After this, I sold 6 Dozen to one Mr. Plummer in the Borrough for 6 s. Tee Prisoner's Wife and he were both at the Door, the same Time. This Money I likewise deliver'd to the Prisoner, and he gave me 3 s. 6 d. for my Trouble.
Prisoner. I desire she may be asked, whether one Mrs. Deal, did not deliver her the Goods at 1 s. per Dozen?
Haydon. I don't know Mrs. Deal, nor did I ever see her in my Life, as I know of.
Prisoner. Was not Mr. Deal and his Wife in the Room when she was there, and took the Loopes to dispose of?
Haydon. No, there was none in the Room but the Prisoner.
Eliz. Turland. I saw about 6 Dozen of the same Goods I had lost in Mr. Compton's Shop in Pater-noster row. We gave him Notice to be here Yesterday; but I have not seen him here to Day. Mr. Compton own'd before my Lord-Mayor, that he bought them of 2 Women, one of whom, he knew to be a Loop-maker upon Clerkenwell-Green, but he said he could not tell where to find her. I saw only Thread Loopes at his Shop, but he said he had bought 2 Dozen of Silk Coat Loopes among them, at 2 s per Dozen, when a Crown a Dozen is my Market Price. My Lord granted me his Warrant to bring Mr. Compton before him, and he order'd him to let the Constable have the Goods. I saw them, and they were part of the Goods I lost. Mr. Compton said he did not know the Value of them. My Lord-Mayor granted me a Warrant for Mr. Plummer in the Borough, but he refused to let me have my Goods, unless I would pay him 12 s. tho' I saw them at his Shop, and he gave but 6 s. for them.
Mr. Turland. Mr. Justice Engier told me I must return Mr. Plummer 12 s. then I might take my Goods. Mr. Plummer and his Wife said, they bought them of 2 Women who had a great deal of Work, and that they might have bought much more; and Mrs. Plummer told her Husband she had a Notion that they were 2 loose Creatures, of whom he bought this Work, and she seem'd to be frighted. Mr. Plummer lives at the 3 Kings on the other Side of the Bridge.
Prisoner. I had the Goods of one Deal and his Wife; and Haydon saw me deliver the Money she gave me to Deal and his Wife, at the Post Boy, and they gave her 6 s.
Haydon. I never changed a Word with any one but the Prisoner upon this Affair; nor had I any Money but what he gave me.
Cockran. Here's the Prisoner who heard Haydon say, she would swear my Life away for a full Pot of Beer.


                  Tho 
                  James 
               



            , a Prisoner. I am in Custody for taking a Handkerchief. I heard Haydon say, she had the Loopes to dispose of from Cockran's House. I heard nothing more

, in the Parish of St. Bride's March 20
.
Jane Ellard On the 19th of March I was going along one of the new Streets near Grosvenor-Square, and two Women came up to me from the other Side of the Way, and told me I had a mighty pretty Gown on; - pray, says one of them, what did it cost a Yard? I informed them what I gave for it; Oh! 'tis a sweet pretty Thing they said, - pray which Way are you walking? I told them I was going to look after a Place; they said I should have the Refusal of two or three very good Places, and if I would tell them where I liv'd, they certainly would come and give me Directions about them. I told them that I should be very much obliged to them, and that I lodged at Mr. Pullen's, in George-Alley


, by the Ditch Side. The next Day as the Bells rung Eleven, they came up Stairs; I am very positive to the Prisoner; the other Woman that was with her pass'd for the Prisoner's Mistress. I asked them about the Place they were to help me to, but they told me they were Apprentices to Sir 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Newton 
               



            , at Turnham-Green, and that they must first calculate my Nativity; so out they pull'd a great Book with Heads and Hands in it; they told me a vast deal out of the Book with the Heads and Hands in it, and said I must bundle up all the Things I had, - Rings, Money, and Cloaths. I have but little Money, says I, and I don't Care to bundle up my Cloaths, that can relate nothing to my Fortune, - that's quite silly, and if any body should hear this Business besides our selves, they would laugh at us. Well, they argued with me a great while, and said it must be done, and began to be angry because I would not do it. Why, - says one of them, suppose you were Sick, and a Physician comes and prescribes Physick for you, - if you won't take it, what Good can he do you? 'Tis all the same Thing, we can't pretend to do you any Good, unless you'il do as you are ordered. At last I bundled up all my Cloaths, and they went away, but they returned again, and asked me if I had done as they bad me? I said I had, and that I had put them in my Trunk. Then now, says the Prisoner's Mistress, - with the Blessing of God take them out of your Trunk; I did so: Now, says she, with the Blessing of God, get a Ha'p'orth of Brown Paper. I did not care to go for the Paper, so she went herself, and did up all my Cloaths, telling me they must be done up very close, and not a Breath of Air must come upon them. When this was done they bid me down upon my Knees and say the Lord's Prayer; I refused at first, but by fair Means and foul they made me at last say the Lord s Prayer. Then they bid me turn about and open the Windows, which we had shut, for fear any body should see what we were about. I opened the Windows, and in the mean Time they chang'd the Bundle, and left this in the Room of it, - 'tis full of nothing but Hay and Straw; my Bundle was made up exactly like this Bundle, and they carry'd it quite off. After they had put down this Bundle instead of mine, the Prisoner's Mistress said she must treat with me upon such a Spot of Ground, and bid me, - because it rain'd, - put on my Hat, least I should catch Cold. I went out with them as far as the Royal Bed, the Corner of Holborn, there they told me a young Man was to meet me, and would give me a Gold Ring, charging me not to look at my Bundle 'till Eight o'Clock at Night; at Eight o'Clock I found myself a great Sufferer by them, for all my Cloaths were gone, that I had worked for a great while.
Some little Time after I got a Place at the Corner of Shoe Lane in Holborn, and about a Fortnight after I had been there, I saw the Prisoner go by the Door; I was so fluster'd, that I had no Power to get off my Chair, but by and by I saw her come past again; then I ran after her and begged a young Man to stop her, for she had robbed me. He call'd after her, Hark ye! Hark ye! - and stopped her. She was brought back to my Master's House, from thence she was carried to Guildhall, and so sent to Newgwate.

Prisoner. It was not I that did this, my Landlady knows I never had any Companion belonging to me in my Life, nor did I ever in my Life see any Conjuring Book.

            . I can say nothing to this Fact, but the Prisoner robbed me of two large Silver Spoons, two small Spoons, two Gold Rings, and several other Things, exactly in the same Manner; I said the Lord's Prayer, and this was the Bundle she left me instead of my own.
Prisoner. I am a Mantua-maker
, and never kept Company with any other Woman in my Life. I am as innocent as the Child that is born, - and welcome is the Grace of God.

            , in the Parish of St. Mary-Hill, May 25
.
Mr. Gordon. On the 25th of May, my Cooper and a Constable came to tell me a Man had stole a Quarter-Barrel of Raisins from Smart's-Key


, where I had thirty in all. I went down to the Key, and miss'd one of them. They told me the Man was in Custody; and while I was talking to them, the Barrel was brought to me, and had been taken out of the River; for the Prisoner (it seems) had thrown it over Board. The Mark upon the Barrel was mine, and I believe it was my Property. I lost nothing by the Goods, but sold them for the same Money, as I should have done, had nothing of this happen'd.


                  William 
                  Symmonds 
               



            . I was coming in a Boat past Smart's-Key, and saw the Prisoner there, with a Barrel in his Arms. He was coming into a Boat with it, and tumbled down, Barrel and all, into the Boat. My Waterman said, - There's a Thief. I made him shove back, and then the Prisoner heav'd something over board. Upon this we took him, and carry'd him ashore. In his Boat we found two Pieces of the Head of the Barrel, and some of the Raisins. In two or three Hours afterwards, the Barrel was taken out of the Water, and we compar'd the Pieces we found in the Bottom of the Boat, with the Breaches in the Head of the Barrel, and they fitted: Part of the Mark was upon the Pieces, which flew out when he fell with the Barrel, and part was upon the Head of the Barrel itself. We found, by comparing this Mark, with that upon Mr. Gordon's Barrels, that the Goods belonged to him, so they sent for him, and he own'd them.


                  Robert 
                  Colson 
               



            , the Waterman, confirm'd Mr. Symmonds. Testimony, adding, that he very plainly saw the Prisoner throw the Barrel over-board, after he tumbled into his Boat, and that the Pieces of the Barrel Head, which were shewn Mr. Gordon, were the same that he took out of the Prisoner's Boat

. The Gown was lost 5 Weeks ago, off the Back of a Chair in the back Parlour. The Doors of the House were open, and we imagine she watch'd her Opportunity to slip in and take it. But it being advertised, Mr. Smitherman the Pawnbroker brought the Prisoner to our House, and she fell down on her Knees, and swore she never took the Gown away. My Mistress then took her into our back Parlour, and there she confessed before

            . This is the Gown which the Prisoner brought me to pledge on the 28th of Aug. She asked 4 Guineas upon it, and said it was a Gentlewoman's in the Neighbourhood, who knew me very well. I did not care to lend so much upon it, so she took it away; but in 5 Minutes Time she brought it again, and said the Gentlewoman would take 3 Guineas, I told her I would lend but 2 Guineas upon it, which she took, and I sent my Boy after her to see where she went. The Boy watch'd her into a House, and I was satisfied; but the Gown being advertised 2 Days afterwards, I went to Mr. Hayward's, told them I had the Gown, and they have it again. Then I set People to watch for the Prisoner, they sent me Word that she was at an Alehouse; I went and took her from thence and carry'd her to Mr. Hayward's. I am positive she is the Person that brought me the Gown.

Tho. Davis. I live in the Tower of London



. On Monday the 25th of September I went to my Burean, in my Chamber, and open'd it (as usual) to take a Guinea out of a Purse, which contain'd 7 Guineas, and a mourning Ring, but it was gone; somebody had taken it away. The next Day I miss'd 9 Shirts, a dimitty Waistcoat, 3 Scarves, - 3 or 4. Three Handkerchiefs, and (I think) a pair of Stockings. Mrs. Bennet having been robbed likewise, and the Prisoner having her Goods, it was suspected that he had got mine; and Endeavours were used to bring him to Confession. At last this Corporal, (
               
                  John 
                  Alexander 
               



            ) brought me 7 of my Shirts, the dimitty Waistcoat, and the Scarves. After these Things were deliver'd to me, I went to the Prisoner, in the Black Hole, and desired to know where my Money was? His Answer was, that he had given his Wife Orders to deliver all, and it she would come to him, he would endeavour to find the rest of my Goods.

                  Alexander 
               



            . I went to the Prisoner after he was taken up, to ask him, if he knew any thing of Mr. Davis's Things? At first he said he did not: but at last he sent me to fetch his Wife to him. She came, and I went back with her to her Lodging, and she deliver'd me all the Things mention'd in Mr. Davis's Indictment, by the Prisoner's Order. He order'd her in my Presence to let me go with her, and to deliver me the Things. These are what she deliver'd to me.
Mr. Davis. These are all mine.

                  Bennet 
               



            . I was robb'd on the 26th of September of some small Linnen, (mention'd in the Indictment) which hung upon the Lines in a Summer-house, upon the Ramparts of the Tower. A Window-shutter was taken off, and all my Things were gone.

                  White 
               



            . I mounted Guard at the Tower on the 26th of September. The Prisoner came on Duty about One o'Clock, and went off without Leave about 3 in the Afternoon. Upon which I return'd him to the Officer. About 11 at Night, the Robbery of Mrs. Bennet was found out; and about that Time he came on Duty, and being suspected, I disarm'd him and took him Prisoner, and found a great many Things that Mrs. Bennet swore to, in his Pockets. Then I took him before the Officers, and he own'd that he clapp'd one Foot against the Wall, and the other against the House, so got up, and wrench'd open the Window with his Bayonet; but he begg'd the Officers would not bring him to Trial for the Fact. I can swear I deliver'd Mrs. Bennet the same Things, I took out of his Pockets.
Mrs. Bennet. And I swear they are all mine.
Prisoner. I lay down to sleep on the Guard-Bed, and don't know how the Things came into my Pocket.

            . On the 10th of September my Family and I had been abroad; we came home about Seven at Night, and I being the last Person that went in, I took the Key from the outside of the Door, and put it into the Lock, on the inside, and latch'd the Door, though I did not lock it. The House is in Catherine-Court, in Princes street, Lothbury


. We sat 'till about 11, and before we went to Bed, the Watchman beat past 9, 10, and 11 o'Clock very hard, and the Door did not open. When we went to Bed I bid the Maid make fast the Door, and I suppose the Watchman having beat at it, and she seeing the Key in the Lock, imagin'd it was fast; but a little after 4 in the Morning the Prisoner (who is a Watchman
, and was upon Duty that Night) came up Stairs, with a Neighbour, to my Chamber, and told me, the Door of my House was wide open, and he thought proper to let me know it. I thanked him for his Care, and gave him 6 d. then I went down, and seeing the Brass and the Pewter standing as they did when I went to Bed, I fasten'd the Door, and was going to my Chamber again; but missing my Hat, (worth about 12 or 14 s.) I call'd up my Family, and then we found one had lost one thing, and another, another Thing. I miss'd nothing but my Hat; and the next Morning a young Man came and told me the Prisoner had sold a Hat; and that the Man who bought it, had pawn'd it in Grub-street. I went to see it, and it prov'd to be mine. When he was before the Lord Mayor, he said he found the Door open, and going in, he saw two Hats hang up, so being a poor Man he took one of them. The Hat was produced before the Lord-Mayor, and he confess'd it was the Hat he took.

            . I liv'd in the House with Mr. George, and lost on the 10th of September at Night, a Velvet Mantelet, worth 15 s. a Hood lac'd, worth 5 s. a Cambrick Apron, worth 5 s. a Cambrick Handkerchief, 2 s. 6 d. a Tortoise-shell Snuff-box inlaid with Silver, 10 s. a Nutmeg Grater 6d. a Muslin Tucker, half made, 1s.

             On Monday Morning, Sept. 10, about 4 o'Clock, the Prisoner call'd out, and said, - here's a Door open; I bid him stay at the Door 'till I came down. He told me 'twas not my Door, however I desir'd him not to go from it 'till I came down. He did so; and I found Mr. George's Door wide open; but as the Brass and Pewter was standing, I was in good hopes nothing was gone. The Prisoner and I went up Stairs to call Mr. George to shut his Door; and he gave the Watchman 6 d. and thanked him for his Care; but in an Hour or two afterwards I heard of these Losses.

             On the 11th of Sept. I heard that Mr. George had been robb'd, and the Prisoner being suspected, I took him up before my Lord Mayor, who committed him to the Compter. Some Days after, I went to see him in Prison, and he told me, that several of the Things were at Mrs. Abdy's, and own'd he had taken them out of Mr. George's House, himself. I inform'd these Gentlewomen what I had heard, and went with them to Abdy's, where we found the Things that have been mention'd. As to the Things that are not found, he told us he knew nothing about them.

            . The Prisoner brought me a Velvet Manteel, a Hood, Handkerchief and Apron, and a scarlet Cloak, on the 11th of September, and pawn'd them with me for 19s. He said they were his Wife's, and that he bought them for her of a Man that ow'd him Money, but as they wanted Money, to prevent her lying in the Street with a young Child he must dispose of them. So I let him have the Money, and afterwards these Gentlefolks came and claim'd them.

            . I am a Watchman in the same Ward with the Prisoner. The Morning after the Robbery was committed, I heard the Prisoner had sold a Hat, and found out the Person he had sold it to, who told me he was to give 6 Shillings and half a dozen of Beer for it. The Tortoise-shell Snuff-box and the Nutmeg-grater, I found the next Morning in a Closet in the Prisoner's own Room, Mr. George and the Constable were present at the same Time.
Mr. George confirm'd these Circumstances.

Prisoner. He did not give me the 2 s. I had but 18 d. I never was at that Stand before that Night, and was told that the Door was open by another Watchman, so I came with him to the Door, and pull'd it close, telling him 'twas only an empty House. Then I went away, and when I came again to beat my Rounds, I struck at the Door and it flew open. Mr. Cotton came to me in the Counter, and promised to give my Wife half a Guinea if I would tell him where the Things were, and when he had got what he could out of me, he gave her nothing at all. Acquitted of the Burglary, and

Prisoner. When you took the Stockings under my Feet, were not other People about the Place?

Mr. Knelms. I had a good Character of him, when I took him, - only I heard he was a little light-finger'd, in such Things as a little Tea, &c. But he confess'd all the Things in the Indictment, and by his Direction we found them at the Pawnbrokers.

            . Last Quarter-Day, I happen'd to be at Mr. Ball's a Cane Chair Maker's in the Minories, and this Gentlewoman at the Bar came in, and enquired for a Woman, with whom she wanted to board; and she told me she had something coming in yearly, and would board with me if I pleased I told her, I would ask my Husband, when I went home, if he car'd to take a Boarder. In the Afternoon she came, and I shew'd her a Room above Stairs, where there was a corner Cupboard, in which we kept our Plate; I open'd it, to shew her the Cupboard, and lock'd it again, (all the Plate was then in it) and having some Business to do in Seething-Lane, I went out, and left her in the Room below Stairs. When I came back the Prisoner was gone, but I did not miss the Plate 'till 11 o'Clock; we were then going to Bed; then I observ'd a Policy of Insurance, which was in the Cup, to lie in the Window; upon this I look'd in the Cupboard, and miss'd all the Things mention'd in the Indictment.

When my Mistress (Williams) was gone out, the Prisoner went up Stairs with me into the Garret, to help me tie up some Lines, while we were there, she ask'd me for a Chamber-pot; I told her there was one in my Room, and she went down again by herself; after this she wanted Snuff: I said, if she would go down and sit by the Kitchen-Fire 'till I had done, I would fetch her some, but when I came down she was gone, I stepp'd to the Chandlers Shop at next Door, and there I found her; she told me she was only going to see her Mother at the Tower, and would come again, but she never did. She did not stay long in the Garret with me, but went down a Quarter of an Hour before me.

            . The Prisoner was taken in Bishopsgate street, on the 2d of Oct. and was carry'd to the Tower Goal. Next Morning I went to her there, and she told me she had sold the Necklace to Mr. Barnes on the other Side Ludgate for 25 s. and the Cup and the Spoons for 4 l. to Mr. Spring on this Side Charing Cross. I went to them both, and they readily told me, they had bought such Things, and there we found them. She offered to go with us herself to the Places if we would give her a Coach.
Mr. Barnes. The latter End of Sept. this Neck-lace was brought to me by a Woman in a Coach, she gave it me to weigh; I told her what it came to, and sent the Money to her (in a Coach) by my Boy. I can't swear to the Prisoner.
Smedley Moore confirmed Mr. Barnes's Evidence, and swore positively the Prisoner was the Person who was then in the Coach, and to whom he carry'd the Money.
Mr. Spring swore, that his Servant fetched him from a Neighbour's House the latter End of Sept. When he came Home he found a Coach at his Door, and the Cup and Spoons upon the Counter; that he weigh'd them, and carry'd the Money for them to the Woman in the Coach, but as it was Candle-light, he could not swear to her.

John Dew. Mrs. Lynnel and I had been to see my Mother in the Strand, on the 4th of February; we came back after Seven o'Clock, and at Fleet ditch we took Coach to carry us to St. Margaret's Hill. On the South Side of St. Paul's, the Prisoner came, and put something into the Coach, and another (who was with him) cry'd out, - Stop! stop! but the Coachman drove on; upon which the Prisoner ran from the Coach-door, and told the Coachman, - If he did not stop, he would knock his Brains out. The Coach was stopp'd by the Prisoner; and I open'd the Coach-door and jump'd out, Mrs. Lynnel jump'd out after me, and slipp'd down; I had no sooner help'd her up, but the Prisoner ran from the Horses Heads to the Coach door again, and cry'd, - D - mn it, where's the Man and the Woman that were in the Coach! I cry'd, here; and he laid hold of me; I took hold of him; he had a Hammer in his Hand: But a Gentleman happening to come by, assisted me, and we took him to a publick House, 'till we could get a Constable. When the Constable came, we found a Peruke under him, but he would not own it belong'd to him. This is the Hammer; and a Knife was also found in his Pocket. He beg'd hard to be let go; but the Constable secur'd him, and the next Morning when he was carry'd before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Thompson 
               



            , he said he believed the Wig that was found under him, (the Night before) was his, and it was accordingly return'd to him by the Constable. I apprehend his Design was to rob us, by his stopping the Coach.

            . On Sunday the 4th of this Month, I was coming through St. Paul's Church-yard, between Seven and Eight o'Clock at Night, and heard a Cry of Stop Thief! - Murder! I went to see what was the Matter, and found Mr. Dew and the Prisoner between the Posts and the Houses. The Prisoner said, - Where's the Man and the Woman that was in the Coach? the Prosecutor said, - I am the Man. Then the Prisoner struck him, and disengaged himself from him; but upon the Prosecutor's calling out, - (What will nobody assist in taking a Street Robber,) I seiz'd him by the Collar.
Prisoner. I was coming along Paul's Churchyard, and this Man and Woman cry'd out, Thieves. I was then before them, and cry'd, - What's the Matter? Upon which the Man said, I suppose you are one of them, and so he laid hold of my Coat, and said I had a Pistol about me; and they carry'd me into a House, and took a Knife from me, tho' I told them I was a Coachman, and that we Coachmen seldom go without Knives about us.
Three Witnesses spoke to the Prisoner's Character, and said they thought he had been an honest Fellow.

Mr. Carter. Last Saturday was three Weeks, (I think it was) about Seven o'Clock in the Evening, my Shop Door was shut, and the Sashes in the Shop Window were shut down, and I was in the Shop myself; but yet somebody in the Street lifted up the Sash, and I saw a Hand take out seven Yards of strip'd Linen. I cry'd out Thieves, and ran to the Door and open'd it, but the Thief was got off with my Goods, and I have never seen them since, nor heard of them, 'till Huddle made his Information before Justice Farmer, and then I was sent for, and Huddle said the two Prisoners were concern'd with him in robbing me.
Huddle. On the 27th of last Month, as the two Prisoners and I were coming down New Gravel Lane


, we stopp'd at this Man's Shop-window. I lifted up the Sash, and we took a Roll of Check, which we carry'd to Mrs. Turner, and she sold it for us, and brought us for it, between nine and ten Shillings, to the best of my Knowledge. I think Mrs. Turner paid the Money to Crockat, and we shar'd it between us.
Keeble. Whereabout did I stand when you took the Linnen?
Huddle. Keeble was at the Steps at the Shop-door, and Crockat was at a Post before the Door, about three or four Yards from the Steps.
Keeble. Where was the Money parted?
Huddle. At Mrs. Turner's House; we turn'd our Backs upon the rest of the Company, and divided the Money.


                  Ann 
                  Turner 
               



            . The two Prisoners at the Bar, and the Evidence, brought me seven Yards of check'd Linnen, and I sold it for 8 s. and gave the Money to Crockat; he was the Man that generally took the Money for all. They brought me some Gloves to sell for them before they brought this Linnen. I think the Linnen was brought in January, on a Saturday Night.


                  John 
                  Smith 
               



             and 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Higgens 
               



             had known Crockat a great many Years, and believ'd he had the Character of an honest Man.


                  John 
                  Riles 
               



             had known Crockat sixteen or seventeen Years, and swore he had been trusted wich a great many Hundred thousand Pounds. Both

            . Feb. 13
.
William Mumford. I went to Bed that Night about Eleven o'Clock, and fasten'd my Door. I rose at Six the next Morning, and found the House broke, and twenty-four Pair of Shoes gone: The Lock of the Door and four Bolts were broke. We have Part of the Goods here; this large Pair of Men's Shoes, and these Girls Pumps, are mine, and they were mark'd, - 2 s. each, but they have rubb'd the Marks out. I don't make them; I only buy and sell. Campbel confess'd before the Justice, that he broke open the House, between Twelve and One o'Clock, and that he took but fourteen Pairs, tho' I miss'd twenty-four when I came to number my Shoes.
Q. What Sort of a House was this?
Mumford. 'Tis a Shoemaker's Shop, and a Cook's Shop; I lie in the House: There are eight Rooms in it.

                  Lewis 
               



            's Husband, came and knock'd at my Door about Six in the Morning: The two Women had their Aprons ty'd up with something in them; I asked them where they had been so early? they told me, - to see the Birds couple, and to gather Chickweed. By and by 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Booth 
               



             put some of her Shoes into my Bed, and Lewis convey'd some of hers under the Table, and they both desired me not to take any Notice, for they would raise some Money upon them, unknown to the Men, and would share it between themselves I hid the Shoes, and Campbel and Booth stay'd there all Day, and quarrel'd about them. He damn'd her for a Bitch, and said there was not all the Shoes; she said, she knew nothing of them; so he lick'd her, and gave her two black Eyes. The next Day Booth and her Sister came and ask'd for one Pair, which I deliver'd into her Apron: And the Day after this Campbel and Booth came again, and as they both sat by the Fire, a Breeches-maker came in, and told me, (in their Hearing) that Mumford's Shop had been broke open, and he had lost a great many Shoes: This was on Friday, and they both seem'd very uneasy, and went away. The next Day, (Saturday) Booth came for the rest of the Shoes; and I told her, I would stop them for Mr. Mumford. As I was speaking, - in came Campbel, and says Booth to him, - do you know any thing of Mumford's Shoes? he told her, no: Push off, says she, and so away he went. When he was gone, she (Booth) asked me if I stopp'd the Shoes? I told her, - yes. Then d - mn my Eyes, (says she) I'll go and see if you have carry'd them home to Mumford, or not. Upon this I sent to Mumford, and he own'd the Goods. I can't say whether the Men had any of the Goods upon them when they came in; 'twas the two Women brought them in, in their Aprons. When they open'd their Laps, and shew'd me the Shoes, I thought 'twas fine Chickweed.
Prisoner Campbel. Did you see any of the Goods upon me?
Clark. He said before the Justice, - That he gave the Woman the Shoes, and if he had had a Sack, he could have carry'd off more.
A Constable. I had a Warrant against the Prisoners, and when we had found them, we carried them before Justice Mercer; Campbel confessed that he broke open the Shop, and stole fourteen Pair of Shoes, and if there was more, the two Women cheated him. He said the two Women were there to receive the Goods, as he brought them out; but they said they were both innocent in the Affair.
Campbel. This Martha Clark owes me a Grudge, because I lodged in her House, and have not paid her; so she and Addey the Thief-Taker have collogu'd together, to take away my Life for the Sake of the Reward.
Prisoner Booth. This Lewis and her Husband had quarrelled, and I went out with her that Night to see Him, about Twelve at Night. Between Five and Six in the Morning, we called at this Clark's for a Dram. There we found Campbel and Lewis's Husband, with their Aprons full of Shoes; which they gave to us, and bid me tell Clark it was Chickweed. We had three or four Pints of Gin among us; and about Ten o'Clock they called us out into the Entry, and took them from us. Campbel told me - his Master was going to break, and he had been helping him off with those Goods.
Lewis. About Eleven at Night my Husband and I had Words; he went out, and I asked Booth to go with me to see for him. We went to several Places, and at last we found him and Campbel at Clark's with the Shoes.
Mumford. When Booth was before the Justice she said Campbel broke open the Shop, and brought out the Shoes, and that she and Lewis took them into their Aprons.
The Constable. Campbel told us, That Lewis's Husband was with them; that He and Lewis broke open the Shop, and the two Women were there, to assist in carrying the Goods away.
Campbel. I did not get up that Morning, till about Five o'Clock, and is it probable that after I had drank Share of so many Half-pints of Gin, I should break open a House! It takes up a good deal of Time to do such a Thing.
Campbel,

                  , about Eight at Night, and stealing a Cloth Coat, a Cloth Waistcoat, a Pair of Buck skin Breeches, five Shirts, five Guineas, four Half Guineas, and twelve Pounds thirteen Shillings in Money, the Property of the said Bridley, in his Dwelling House
            , Feb. 8
.
John Ridley. My House was broke open the 5th of February. I keep Coaches, and there is a Stable joins to my House, and a Door in the Stable, that goes up Stairs to my Chamber. This Door in the Stable must be broke first, and then the Chamber-Door. I went out in the Morning about Nine o'Clock, and left the Prisoner in the Stable, for he used to help me about my Coaches, and I did not come home 'till between Nine and Ten at Night. I am sure I locked the Chamber Door, for I called him up and gave him a Glass of Brandy, before I went out, and he saw me lock the Door when I came out. But when I came home, I found the Door broke, and this Iron was left in my Room, which Mr. Johnson in Grays-Inn Lane proved to be the Prisoner's, and the Prisoner owned Mr. Johnson gave it him. I lost seven Shirts, a Cloth Frock, a Cloth Waistcoat, a Pair of Buck-skin Breeches, and 20 l. in Money. I am positive I had all these Things in the Chamber on Saturday Night, and no one else had been in the Room from that Time to the Time I came home, and found I was robbed. When the Prisoner was taken, one of my Shirts was upon his Back, and he owned it was mine. He deny'd his taking any thing else, at first, but afterwards, when he found I was about to search his Lodging, he confessed his taking every thing, but the Money; and he acknowledged that he he forced open the Door in the Stable with this Iron.
Prisoner. Were all the Things you found in my Custody your's?
Ridley. Yes: - The Shirts were all numbered and marked with I. R. They are in the Constable's Possession, but he could not be here.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Basiere 
               



            . The Prisoner lodged in my House, a Week and two Days; and two Days before he was taken up, he desired me to tye up four Shirts in a Napkin for him, and put them in a Chest which stood in his Chamber, which I did, without looking for any Marks, either good or bad; and seeing a Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches upon his Bed, I put them in likewise. I can't tell whether he had these Things when he came to my House at first, nor did I know what Linnen he had; but three of the Shirts, and the Breeches, were found there, which Mr. Ridley owned, when he searched his Room, and one of the Shirts was upon his (the Prisoner's) Back, but the Coat and the Waistcoat were gone I was present when Ridley searched, and he carry'd the Things he claimed before the Justice. During the Time the Prisoner lived at my House, he used to go out in the Morning, and come home at Night to Bed. I never saw him but twice in his Room, and I know nothing of his Character. A Coachman brought him to me, as an honest Man, and he behaved as such, to the best of my Knowledge.
Bury. Did he break the Door in the Stable, or the Chamber Door with that Iron?
Ridley. He broke the Door in the Stable first, and then the Chamber Door. The Stable Door was a strong Door, but he bent the Staple of the Door back, and then forced open the Chamber Door, which he saw me lock; 'twas a Stock-lock, and a very good one: When he came out, (I apprehend ) he came thro' the Coach-house, which was fastened on the Inside with a wooden Pin; for those Doors were left open, and the Pin was gone.
Prisoner. The Shirts were, - all my own, - every one, - all my own, and the Breeches too. I bought the Breeches in Monmouth-street, and the Shirts in Rag-fair, but nobody was with me when I bought them. 


               Acquitted of the Burglary*, Guilty of the Felony
            .
* Burglary is breaking into an House in the Night, with a Felonious Intent. In Law, 'tis Night when one Person's Face cannot be distinguished from another; Now, although the Prisoner confessed he broke open the Door, he did not in his Confession own at what time it was; and as the Prosecutor was out in the Morning the Offence charged as Burglary might have been committed before Night.

Edward Spragg. About two o'Clock in the Morning the 2 d of last Month, I was coming from the King's Arms Tavern in the Strand, and at Charing Cross



, at the Entrance of some Court thereabouts, I met with the two Women at the Bar. It was dark, so I have no Knowledge of their Faces, and I was pretty much in Liquor, so I can't answer for it, how far I was prevailed upon to listen to them. I was going to my Lodging in Westminster, and either in the Street, or in the Court, one of them took an Opportunity to pick my Pocket. I suspected them, on their endeavouring to run away, so I seized Jane Smith, and charged her with picking my Pocket: She deny'd it, but I held her fast 'till I got to Whitehall, and then I demanded the Assistance of some Soldiers, and they carried her to the Round-House in St. Margaret's Church Yard, where she was searched, but to no Purpose, and she deny'd the Fact. Presently after, the Beadle, or Constable went out, and took Mary Corker, and I believe she was search'd, and nothing being found upon her, she deny'd it likewise. Next Morning this Man, (George Swindell) came to me and told me he believed he could tell me where my Watch was; and that I must get a Warrant for the Man that had it was a Soldier
 upon Duty on the Parade. I got a Warrant for him, (Thomas Smith) and the Officer delivered him up to us. At first he deny'd knowing any Thing of it; but when he was before the Justice, and was ordered to be searched, he said he would not give us that Trouble, he had the Watch about him, and produced it directly. When the two Women were before the Justice, Jane Smith owned she picked my Pocket of it: She said she took it out of my Pocket.
Jane Smith. I will take my Tryal when my Husband is cleared; for he was abed and asleep when the Thing was done. Did not you pick us both up, and ask us where we were going? And did we not tell you, we were going where we could pick up a Sweetheart? Upon which you told us you would give us a Glass of Wine in a convenient Place, and make us a Present.
Spragg. I own I met them in the Strand, but 'tis to no Purpose to ask me any Questions, for, as I hope for Mercy, I can't tell what I said to them.
George Swindell. I am a Barber, and shaved and powdered Thomas Smith. He came into my Shop that Morning about Seven o'Clock, and pulled this Watch out of his Pocket, and I looked at it.
Spragg. This is my Watch.
Swindell. This is the Watch the Prisoner (Thomas Smith) shewed me. I saw him afterwards under Arms on the Parade, and having learned at the Round-house that a Gentl man had lost such a one the Night before, I went to Mr. Hilsley, the Constable, and he directed me to Mr. Spragg.


                  John 
                  Hilsley 
               



            . On Monday Morning, April 2, between Two and Three o'Clock, this Gentleman brought Jane Smith to the Watch-house in St. Margarets Church-Yard, and charged her with picking his Pocket of a Gold Watch in a Court somewhere about Chairing-Cross. I understood by Jane Smith, 'twas done in Northumberland Court. She insisted upon it, that she had it not, and that several other Women were with him, and if it was lost, somebody else had it. The Gentleman was positive that only she and another Woman were with him; upon which I purged her, to know who that other Woman was, and at last she said if it was any body, 'twas Mary Corker, and described her to us. We then secured her, and went out to see after Corker; and hearing by a Watchman, that She and Thomas Smith, the Soldier, were just gone down an Alley, we went after them, and seeing a Man and a Woman before us, I stepped after the Woman, and caught hold of her, [Corker] but the Soldier ran away as hard as he could. We carry'd her to the Watch-house and searched her, but did not find the Watch. However we locked Her and Jane Smith up in the Round-house 'till Morning; and about Nine o'Clock Swindell (the Barber) came and inform'd me he had seen such a Watch in Thomas Smith's-Possession, so we got a Warrant and took him off the Parade; and at Justice Manley's he pulled out the Watch, and said he would not give us the Trouble to search him. After this we sent to fetch the two Women, and at an Alehouse (where we waited 'till the Justice could hear us) Jane Smith confessed she took it out of the Gentleman's Pocket, - yes, damn her Soul she did, and she did not value it, - she had kept a House before now, at Antigua, she said; and (snapping her Fingers) she did not value being sent there, nor going abroad, provided she was not sent to Virginia or Maryland. She owned that while the Gentleman was fond of her, she took his Watch out of his Pocket, and convey'd it to Corker.


                  Ann 
                  Swindell 
               



            . The next Morning after the Fact was committed, I going to Tothil-street; and seeing a Mob about the Round-house, I made up like one of the Foolish Women, to see what was the Matter: I saw 
               
                  Jenny 
                  Smith 
               



             at the Window, and Molly Corker was asleep; I bid Jenny wake Molly, and then I asked them, what they were there for? Jenny Smith took a Gold Watch from under her Petticoats, and a black String and a Seal and Key out of her Stocking, which she shew'd me, and said, - Is not this a noble Watch? And Thomas Smith, her Husband, standing at the Window, she gave it to him, and said, - My dear Tom Smith be true to me; he took the Watch from her, and said, - D-mn my Soul if I am not, then he put it into his Pocket.
Jane Smith. This Woman came to the Round-house, to ask Molley Corker for her Cloak; and she told us she was going for two Gallons of Liquor, and would send us a Dram; and she said, that as we had been searched, we might keep the Watch, and might make the most of it; so she took it away with her in some foul Linnen, and carry'd it to my Husband. The Gentleman that pick'd us up told us he had no smaller Money than a Moidore, and must trust to his Honour; I found the Watch in my Cloaths, and as he was so dishonourable as to cheat us, I thought I would not give it him again.
Thomas Smith. I met Mrs. Swindell that Morning in Green's-Alley, and she desired me to carry a dirty Cap and an Apron, and the Watch, to her House: She told me a Man had left it with her for a Pledges so I took it and went to the Barber's, and from thence to the Parade, where I was taken.

                  Swindell 
               



            . On my Oath, Smith gave it her Husband through the Window.

                   in the King's Highway, putting him in Fear, and taking from him three Shillings and a Penny Half-penny in Money
            , March 18



.
The Witnesses were examined a-part.


                  David 
                  Parry 
               



            . About Nine o'Clock at Night, on the 19th of March, as I was coming over Tower-Hill





, I was stripp'd of my Money, but who took it, I can't tell. I can give no Manner of Account of my being attacked, or having a Squabble, but I did not carry home one Farthing of Money. I had been at Lambeth, and carried Money out with me, and the last Publick House I was at, was on London Bridge. And I remember I parted with a Friend at the Monument, and that somebody took my Money from me on Tower Hill, but who they were that did it, I can't tell, nor what passed between us; but I lost 3 s. and some Half-Pence upon Tower-Hill. I'm sure it was there.


                  Achilles 
                  Dent 
               



            . The two Prisoners and I, made an Agreement to go a-thieving on the 18th of March last -
Prisoner. And the former Witness swore to the 19th.
Parry. It was the 18th of March, - I am sure 'twas on a Sunday Night I was robbed.
Dent. They and I went out a Thieving; we went out first upon the Water, and got into two Sloops, but we could make no Hand of it, and being pursued, we came ashore, and as we were going over Tower-Hill, Bull said, the first Man we met, he would have his Money or his Life. And happening to meet Mr. Parry, we held him, while Bull searched his Pockets. He pulled out a Penknife with a Buckshorn Handle, and threatn'd to rip out his Guts if he did not deliver his Money. We took three Shillings and one Penny Half-penny from him, and divided one Shilling and a Half penny a piece. I never saw the Prosecutor before that Night, to my Knowledge, but I heard his Name, for while Bull was rifling his Pockets, he said, don't hurt poor Mr. Parry, for he is a Man that hurts nobody. When the Prisoners were carry'd before the Justice, and Mr. Parry was sent for, Bull, as soon as he saw him, said to a Gentleman that stood by him, - here comes the Jamming Cull, (meaning the Man that was to hang him.)
Prisoners. How come you to find out Mr. Parry so soon?
Dent. After we had robbed him, we followed him down Rosemary Lane, and I took Notice where he went in.


                  Thomas 
                  Sullivan 
               



            . I was at the apprehending the two Prisoners, and Bull told me, if he had thought he should have seen my ugly Face, he would have been many Miles off. When they were before the Justice, Black Sam [Stanton] desired me to speak to the Justice, that he might be admitted an Evidence, for says he, this Evidence (Dent) can speak to nothing but this Robbery, and I can speak to four or five more, he (Dent) has not been long enough with us to tell of any more than this one.
Bull. If Col. Williamson was here he would secure Sullivan, for sending Men to France.


                  John 
                  Miller 
               



            . I am a Servant to the Keeper of New Prison. The two Prisoners and Dent were brought to us at Twelve o'Clock at Night, and the next Morning were carry'd before Mr. Justice Farmer; the two Prisoners were hand-cuff'd, and the Evidence had an Iron on: When they were before Mr. Farmer, Dent told us where Mr. Parry liv'd, and a Porter was sent for him, but he return'd, and could not find the House; upon which Mr. Farmer order'd me to go with Dent, and see if we could find it; so we went out together, and he carry'd me to it, and told me at that Time, that the Man's Name was Parry; I enquired at the House for Mr. Parry, and his Wife told me he belong'd to the Custom-house, and was not at Home, but he should come between Two and Three o'Clock; and he accordingly came, and gave an Account of this Robbery. As to the Knife which the Evidence mentions, I search'd Bull, and took it out of his Pocket the Morning he was hand-cuff'd: I heard the Evidence mention before the Justice, that while they were rifling the Man, he said, Don't hurt poor Mr. Parry, &c. When we had been before the Justice, Bull snatch'd up a Pint Pot, and gave the Evidence such a Knock with it, that I thought he had beat his Brains out.
Bull. And I had Reason enough, when he was about to swear my Life away.
Miller. This is the tenth or twelfth time that Bull has been tried for his Life.
Jury. How came this Evidence to be taken up?
Dent. I was taken up on one Emanual Hubbard's Information; and was in Custody, but he could not find a Prosecutor.
Bull. When the Thief-Takers caught us, they said, There was 280 l. dead Money for them. I was born in Colchester, and have no Friends, but I am not to be cast for that.
Stanton. I have no Friends; I was born in Antigua.
Both 


               Guilty of Felony * only.
            

* N. B. Robbery is a felonious and violent taking away from the Person of another, Goods to any Value, putting him in Fear: Now the Jury were of Opinion, there was not sufficient Evidence of the Violence, (in which Case the Law would presume putting in Fear) and that it was no more than a private taking from the Person.

            . I have seen the Prisoner bring Lamps into my Room, in Lambeth-Rents, in Petticoat-Lane. About five Weeks ago, I saw him bring a Globe Lamp in his Apron into the Room, about two o'Clock in the Morning: I can't remember the Day of the Month, but 'twas the Day the Charity-Children walked to Christ-Church. I saw him pull it out of his Apron and set it down on the Dresser: Then He, and William Greenaway's Brother, called up Greenaway out of his Bed, and asked him, if he would go out with them to get more, and they all went out again on that Design. The Prisoner had formerly lodged in the House, but had left his Lodging there, some Time before the Fact was committed.

            . About seven Weeks ago we lost seven Lamps out of our Ward, and upon Enquiry after them, I heard that some disorderly Persons had a Lodging in a little Alley, in Petticoat-Lane. On the 15th of May I went to this Room, having been directed to it by a Watch-man, and found five or six Fellows playing at Cards, but there was neither Chair, Table, nor Stool in it.

             told me he belonged to the Room, and upon looking about, I saw a Heap of Rags, under which, I found six Rims of Lamps. Greenaway told me they belong'd to him, that he was a Lamp-Lighter, and lit Lamps in Thames-street. I told him we had lost several Lamps, and that I must take him into Custody. I seized him accordingly, and he was committed to Bridewell as a Disorderly Person, because the Tin Man could not swear to the Rims. The next Morning I went again to the same Room, and took Vaughan, the Evidence. As I brought him down Stairs, he told me he had a Favour to beg of me; which was, that I would intercede for him, that he might be made an Evidence.
Prisoner. I was coming along, and saw two or three Fellows upon some Lamp Posts, and they asked me to take down one or two for them; I was in Liquor, and took one down, which I carry'd for them to this House: Then they ask'd Will. Greenaway to get up, and go out with them again for more; he did so, and they all went out again, but I did not know what they were about, for I was in Liquor the same Time.

            . I am a Book-keeper
 to the Peterborough Waggon, at the Horse-shoe Inn, in Goswell-street



. The Box of Goods was brought to me, on the 28th of April, it was taken in by my Servant, and was directed to Mrs. 
               
                  Barbara 
                  Jakeman 
               



            , at Peterborough. The Goods were lost out of the Yard, and I paid 50 l. for them.


                  John 
                  Spencer 
               



            . On the 28th of April, ('twas Saturday Night) between Nine and Ten, I took in the Box to go by the Peterborough Waggon on Monday Morning to Mrs. 
               
                  Barbara 
                  Jakeman 
               



            , at Peterborough. Mr. Marriot's Man brought it in, and a Carman brought up a Truss of Goods, and put it under the Shed, and the Box was set upon the Truss. The Prisoner Wint brought up the Carman's Whip after him, and I thought he had belonged to him. In less than Half an Hour, the Box was taken away, but I can't say the Prisoner took it.
Wint. Ask him whether he's positive I am the Person that brought the Carman his Whip?
Spencer. Yes.
Wint. Did you ever see me before?
Spencer No.
Wint. Then how can you be positive; you say it was between Nine and Ten o'Clock at Night?
Spencer. I had a Candle and Lanthorn, and saw more Men at the Door, but I cannot swear the Prisoner Brown was one of them.
Wint. Are you positive that I brought the Carman his Whip?
Spencer. I don't care to swear it positively.


                  James 
                  Akins 
               



            . This John Brown, Jemmy Wint and I were in Moorfields, playing at Skittles, and from thence all went through Coleman street, and along the City, to see if any Chance offered. When we came to Aldersgate, we saw a Cart going through the Gate: Wint said, - here's a Chance, and he jumped up, and pulled the Box towards the Tail of the Cart, but at Long-Line End, the Carman turned about and put it farther in the Cart again We followed the Cart to the Horse-shoe Inn; then the Carman took the Box to carry up the Inn, and cry'd, - who will hold my Whip? Wint said, - I will. Then the Carman took a Truss and carry'd it and the Box up the Yard, and Wint followed with the Whip. In a little Time he came down the Yard again, and said, - 'twas hoddy enough; - we shall have it presently. Then he went up the Yard again, and brought the Box as far as the Horse-Pond, but a Woman coming up the Yard he set it down, and when the Woman was gone, he went in again, and brought it clear off. Brown stood at the Watch-House at a little Distance from the Inn, and I sat upon a Bench, where I could see all he did; we kept asunder, that the People might have no Occasion to suspect us, from seeing too many of us together. I have known Wint and Brown a great while, and here's a Man they call the Handsome Drawer, that has often seen us together.


                  Robert 
                  Staples 
               



            , the Handsome Drawer. I am Servant at the Farthing Pye House, the Sign of the Maiden Head, a Publick House on Windmill Hill. I have seen them several Times together, but can't recollect the particular Days. I have often seen them together in Moorfields, and they have been several Times, since last Christmas at our House, and at other Ale-houses. I know nothing of their Characters, for I never conversed with them, nor do I know how they get their Bread. I have heard, that one of them is a Calender, and the other a Weaver.
Wint. Have you ever heard any Harm of me?
Staples. Harm! - I never saw any thing of Harm. - I have heard but an indifferent Character of them. - I can alledge nothing against them. - I have heard their Characters are but indifferent.
Akins. When we had got the Box, we carry'd it into the Fields, and there we broke it open, and took out the Goods. We carried them to my Room, and fetched Bullinbroke and Deal to buy them. We bargained for 7 l. 8 s. 6 d. She knows 'tis true, and that this was not the first Time she has been at our House, and she knew how we came by our Goods. I went to her that very Night about Eleven o'Clock, and she told me, she could not come to look at the Things that Night, but she lent me a Shilling, and she was at that Time a-bed with Deal. On Sunday Morning she came to see the Goods; we bargained, and she took the Silk away with her then, and gave us a Guinea in Part, out of a Green Purse. On Monday Morning they came and took more of them, and gave us another Guinea, and in the Afternoon they came and took all the rest away, and paid us the rest of the Money.
Bullinbroke. Did I, or Jemmy Deal, buy the Goods?
Akins. She made a Bargain for the Silk, and was to give four Guineas for it. Deal and she fetched away the Gloves in a Hand-Basket. The Woman knows me very well, her Husband, 
               
                  William

             was hanged * a very little while ago. And Wint was an Evidence against Grafton Kirk and Terry Gerrard+.
* He was convicted last December Sessions. See his Trial, No. 16.

            , and Mr. Adams in the Endfield Coach.
Wint. I have People to speak to my Character, ever since I was Guilty of that Fault.

                  Meredith 
               



            . I come to speak for the young Man, - I can't think of his Name, - but I know him; my Brother marry'd his Mother, - I can't think of his Name, - he never wronged any body in the World.


                  John 
                  Anderson 
               



            . I live in Brick-Lane; am a Broker and a Weaver too. I come to speak for 
               
                  John 
                  Culverrwell 
               



            , -
Brown. That's my right Name.
Anderson. He is a Journey-man Weaver
 by Trade, and I have seen him at Work at his Father-in-Law's, - 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Meredith 
               



            , in Angel-Alley; I believe I have seen him at Work, within these twelve Months. As to his general Character, I have heard but very little amiss of him. - He might be given to Drinking, or so, - I have not heard much against him.
Mr. Chamberlen. On the 23d of May, Brown was bought before me, and made a voluntary Information of ten or twelve Robberies, and put Akins into his Information. I had heard of this Robbery, in Goswell-street, and asked him if he was concerned in that. He said, - upon his Word he was not. I bid him conceal nothing, and told him, if I found he did, I would have nothing to say to him. Akins had put this Robbery into his Information, and so I would not stop him. If Brown had confessed this, I should have admitted him an Evidence against Akins.
Three Witnesses appeared for Brown. One always thought him to be honest and just: Another took him to be a sober Lad, but as to his Character he never enquired into that; and the 3d never knew any Harm of him.
A Woman appear'd for Wint, and gave an Account that she had employ'd him in carrying Fruit, Greens, &c. for her to Spittlefields Market; that he did this Business for her about four Months, and then enter'd himself on Board a Man of War; that he came home about Christmas last, and since that Time had fetch'd Scores of Pounds for her.
Jury. Had Brown Part of the Money?
Akins. Yes. Out of the first Guinea we had 7 s. a-piece, and the Money was shar'd in the Room where we liv'd. The other Guinea was shar'd in the Street, at Whitechappel, and the rest we shar'd in the Afternoon. Brown had his Share of the whole. Wint,

 * Whitehurst had been try'd several Times before, as a Receiver from Felons, and but last Sessions was try'd as a Principal, for stealing an Iron Chain, the Property of the Governor and Company of the New-River Water. See Sessions-Book, 1739, p. 78, No. 271.

            . On the 27th of December, it being Holiday-time, I went out about One o'Clock at Noon, and left one Shutter down, in the Front of my Shop, and order'd my Maid to shut up the Shop in the Close of the Evening. The next Morning I miss'd the Things mention'd in the Indictment, and which stood in the Window when I went out. I keep a Plumber's Shop
, and I believe the Goods might weigh about 1 C. Weight. I never heard any thing of them till the Evidence was before Mr. Deveil.

, in the Christmas Week, and seeing the Shutters just open, we push'd them on one Side, and took out the Cistern-head; which we sent by the Prisoner Francis to Whitehurst then we got the Pump, and carry'd it to him, and he gave us 5 s. 6 d. for them.
Wright. They were of the Value of 3 l.
Lewis. Whitehurst is a Man who buys such Things; he knew how we came by them, which was the Reason of his having them so cheap. He has been try'd four or five Times for such Things before this Time.
Francis. We did not sell them to this Man; we sold them to one Lambeth in Compton street.
Lewis. Whitehurst gave me Half-a-Crown this very Day, to clear him upon this Trial, and promised me three Half-Crowns more when he was clear'd: This is the very same Half-Crown he gave me under the Leads this Day. He was let out of the Place where the Prisoners are lock'd up, to take the Air.
Mr. Townsend. He was let out to air himself, and I saw him in the Yard; but I did not see the Witness there.
Lewis. I was there; and his Wife took it out of his Pocket, and gave it another Woman to give me.
Whitehurst. I gave him none; I have not had Half-a-Crown in my Pocket this Month.

Candy. I was going home between One and Two in the Morning, in the Month of May, the 9th Day of the Month. - I live in a Habitation in Flying-Horse Court


, - just by the Waxwork Shop, between Chancery Lane and St. Dunstun's Church; and I had not got up above two Thirds of the Passage, before I found my Hat go off my Head: I made a Back-blow with my Stick, but I miss'd my Man, (else he would have felt me) and I turn'd myself round at the same Time, and saw the Prisoner run over the Way; I ran after him, and he got Ground of me, but he dropp'd my Hat, and this honest Chairman stopp'd him as he ran between the Poles of the Chairs. When I came up to him, he said, - I'faith I have name of your Hat No, says I, - but, I will carry you to the Place where you dropp'd it. That's the Man at the Bar, - for I never saw the Face of him till the Chairman took hold of his Wrist, and turn'd him about; then we carry'd him to the Watch-house, and asked him where he lodged? He told us in Rosemary-Lane. I asked him where he was going at that Time o'Night? He said, - to see a Friend at St. James's: I reply'd, - He was likely to have more Halberds than Links to attend him. - All the whole Thing was done in three Minutes.
Prisoner. I ask him, whether he had any Debate with any other Person, before he came out of the Alley?
Candy. I was not in the Court, - but in the Passage; and I saw no one Soul living, till finding my Hat go off, I struck at him by Guess, and if I had hit him, he would not have been here, for I should have pay'd him heartily, and so have dismis'd him.

            . I was standing at the Temple Exchange Coffeehouse with my Chair, and hearing Candy cry, - Stop Thief, and seeing the Prisoner run, I clapp'd hold of his Wrist, and Candy said, - Let's lead him back, for he has dropp'd my Hat; I carry'd him five, six or seven Yards back, and found the Hat in the Kennel: Then I carry'd the Prisoner and the Hat to the Watch-house, and deliver'd the Hat to the Constable, or the Watchman, I don't know which, I am sure the Prisoner is the Man I took; for I had the Watchman's Lanthorn, and my own, to see him by, - and I was with him at the Watch-house.
Prisoner. Please to ask him, whether the Prosecutor was drunk or sober?
Couster. I can't say for that I was at Charing-Cross a little while before, and saw him ( Candy ) at the Fountain Tavern, and he was talking about having a Chair, and my Partner said, - Candy don't want a Chair, and in about half an Hour afterwards he came homewards. He said no more that Night, than he said in the Morning, nor was he so disorder'd, as to be incaple of knowing what he did.
Prisoner. Did not the Deputy-Constable tell him he was a drunken, troublesome Fellow?
Causter. There was a Dispute in the Watch-house, and a great many People crowded about, so that I could not tell positively what the Constable said.

            , Constable. The Prisoner was brought to the Watch-house, and Candy charg'd him with taking his Hat. I was not there when he was first brought in, but Candy (I found) charged him with taking his Hat, so I sent him to Bridewell, and afterward carry'd him before a Justice. This is the Hat; I have had it ever since in my Custody. Candy had been drinking, but was not so fuddled as not to know a Man. He told me, he had been serving Copies of Writs; he walk'd as well as at other Times, but he is but a lame Walker at best.
Jury. Who is your Deputy-Constable?
Lewis. We have no Deputy-Constable: One of our Watchmen is a Staff-man in the Parish; his Name is Glover.
Jury, to Candy. What is your Business?
Candy. I am a Porter
 at Temple-Bar, and have ply'd there these fifty Years. Here's a Gentleman in Court has known me a great many Years; I have received some Thousands of Pounds at his House.
The Gentleman. I have known him 25 Years: He is a Porter at Temple-Bar, and is employ'd by Gentlemen belonging to the Temple: I never heard any Thing amiss of him, nor of his being a drunken Fellow; with regard to that, I believe he is like other Porters. *


               Guilty, 10 d
            .
 * As this was laid for privately stealing from the Person, had the Jury found the Value to have been above 1 s. it had been a Capital Offence.

The Watch pursu'd him, and we followed them, and took him (about twenty Yards from the Place where he stopp'd me) with the Knife in his Hand, and the Crape upon his Face, which he pull'd off, as soon as the Watchman laid hold of him.
Mr. West confirmed the former Evidence.

, July 29
.
Richard Summer. On the 29th of July, as I was coming along the Devil's-Nook, - 'tis an Alley in Long-Lane, I met with 
               
                  Richard 
                  Goodyere 
               



            , so he and I went to drink together at the Green Dragon in Long-Lane: I had a Horse to dispose of, and he was to help me to a Chap who was to buy him, but they wanted me to take their Note for the Money. After we had talked a while about the House they told me they could help me to the Watch I had lost*, and if I would> give him a Guinea, they would get it directly: Upon this Account I went to Goodyere's House, between Seven and Eight o'Clock in the Evening, and there was the Prisoner and two other Women. We fell to drinking Gin, and after we had drank a while, Richard Goodyere began be quarrelsome, and said he believed I had not Money to pay the Reckoning, I pull'd out my Bag, to shew them that I had Money, and the Prisoner snatch'd it out of my Hand, and Richard flung me down, and I fell with my Head against a Chair, the Blow stunn'd me for some Time, and I got up as soon as I could, - but every Soul of them were ran away, there was no one left in the House but myself: They all ran over into the Marshalsea, where they had a Friend who took them in, and it was a Week before I could take them; there were three of them concerned, but I took only the two Goodyeres, and carry'd them before the Lord Mayor, where she said nothing at all, and he confess'd he had my Gold.
* See the preceeding Trial of Elizabeth Allen.
Prisoner. Ask him if he has not been robb'd, since?
A Gentleman. He has been simple enough to be robb'd of 70 l. since this.
Prisoner. Richard Goodyere was my Husband: He died in Goal, on this Account. Here's my Certificate.
Summer. They were a-bed together when they were taken, and I believe they said they were Man and Wife before the Lord Mayor.

                  Seares 
               



            . I received this Certificate from the Prisoner, as a Proof of her being marry'd.
The Certificate was read.
'' These are to certify, that 
               
                  Richard 
                  Goodyere 
               



            , '' Brewer's Servant, of St. Sepulchre's, Batchelor, '' and 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Watkins 
               



            , Widow, were '' marry'd in St. Sepulchre's Parish, in London, '' the 30th of July 1739, according to the '' Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of '' England, as appears by the Register in the '' Custody of '' W. WIAT, Minister.''
Summer. But I am sure I was robb'd the 29th of July. She took the Money out of my Hand the 29th, and I charge her only, with taking it in the Warrant: I am positive she is the Woman. I saw her (I believe) once before, in Smithfield; she is a remarkable Woman, and is a little humpback'd.
Prisoner. Ask him if he did not ask my Husband to give him some of the Money again, and if he did not tell him he had none of it?
Summer. I did ask him to give me some of it again, before he was committed; I should have been glad to have got some of it again.

Woodall. I am a Pipe-borer
 to the New River Company. I was coming home from Work about Ten o'Clock at Night, on the 19th of August, and the Prisoner asked me to give her a Pint of Beer; I told her I would spend my three Halfpence with her, and she carried me to a private House, a Ginhouse in Love-Court, in George-Alley


, between Shoe-Lane and the New Market. We had two Quarterns of Gin, and I staid with her about Half an Hour. I had my Watch at a Quarter past Ten, and miss'd it before she went down Stairs. We had been pretty near together, and I felt her pluck something out of my Pocket, but I could not tell what it was: As soon as I miss'd it, I ran down Stairs after the Prisoner, and met a Woman upon the Stairs, and she blew the Candle out, to prevent my following her; but I pursu'd her, and found her out; and took her last Friday, but she would confess nothing, and I have never seen my Watch since.
Prisoner. Ask him if he did not promise to give me a Shilling?
Woodall. No: I promis'd her nothing, but she made bold to pay herself well, - for she got my Watch, and that's the Truth.
Prisoner. Ask him if there was not another Woman in Company with us.
Woodall. There was another Woman who brought the Liquor, but she only staid to drink two Glasses of Gin.

            . When this Woman was put in the Compter, I happen'd to be there myself, and I ask'd her, what she was brought in for? She told me, - for picking a Cull's Pocket of a Loge, (a Watch) three Weeks ago, which I have sold for - Money, said she.
Prisoner. This Woman is a nasty drunken Creature, and knows nothing of the Matter: 'Twas the other Woman that was in the Room with us, who took the Watch. The Man shook Hands with me when I left him, and he bid me Good-night.

This Mark [ + ] is prefixed to such Indictments on which the Prisoners would receive Sentence of Death, should the Jury find them Guilty, generally; which will in this Case, and many others, account for the Jury's finding specially the Value of the Goods to be less than is laid in the Indictment.
The following are Capital Offences, viz.
Privately taking above the Value of 1 s. from the Person. Stealing the Value of 5 s. out of a Shop, Warehouse , Coach-house or Stable. Stealing the Value of 40 s. out of a Dwelling-house.
Mrs. Fountain. I am a Widow, and live in St. Martin's Lane


. On the 14th of November I lost this Piece of Cloth; 'tis about twenty-two Yards, and the Value of it is 20 s. I sell Linnen Cloth; and the Prisoner came into my Shop (with another Woman) between Three and Four o'Clock that Afternoon, and I thought they had been acquainted with each other. The Prisoner asked for nothing, but the other Woman asked for Cloth, and bought some of my Daughter. After she had paid for it, she went away, and the Prisoner with her, but she (who had been the Customer) returned presently, and said, - I believe you have lost something, look after that Woman that was in the Shop: I said, - O Lord! I thought she had belonged to you! and immediately I ran out of the Shop, and saw the Prisoner at the Corner of Long-Acre, I pursu'd her, and she ran away very hard, upon which I call'd out, - Stop that Woman! and accordingly she was stopp'd in Angel-Alley by 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Holder 
               



            . As soon as he took hold of her, she squatred down on the Ground, but he lifted up her Cloak, and found this Piece of Cloth, which is mine, and was lost off my Counter. When the Cloth was found, she beg'd Pardon, and desir'd she might be let go for God's Sake, for she was a poor-Widow, and had two Children. I was mov'd, and sorry for her; but the People about us bid me carry her back to my Shop, and there she fell down on her Knees, and again ask'd Forgiveness: I told her, she had not offended me, and bid her ask Pardon of God; then the Beadle came up, and took her before Mr. De Veil, and so she was brought here.
Thomas Holder. I took the Cloth from under the Prisoner's Cloak, in Angel-Alley, in the Presence of Mrs. Fountain, and by her Order. The Prisoner own'd she took it, and beg'd Pardon.

What's your Husband's Name said I? O says she, you need only call - Corporal. I did so, and while I was going to the Window, I saw her go to the Bed's Head. After I had called - Corporal, he came up to the Top of the Stairs, but she pushed him back, and told him, the Room would not do. I followed them down Stairs, and they had not been gone long , before a Thought came into my Head, that perhaps I had lost my Watch. I went up Stairs, and saw 'twas gone.

Roger Life. Last Saturday Night I lost nine Sheep, out of a Field in the Parish of Acton


 , five Ews and four Wethers: They were all mark'd with R. L. the Letters standing cross each other, and a Dot on the near Shoulder. They were found on Monday, in the Possession of one Simmonds , a Butcher, in Smithfield: Five of them were kill'd, and four I saw alive, with my Pitchmark on them: I know they are mine. Simmonds told us he bought them of the Prisoner, and when we took him up, he offer'd to make us any manner of Satisfaction. I ask'd him if he had nobody with him, to help him to get the Sheep out of the Ground? He told us, no; he had no body but himself.
Prisoner. Ask Mr. Life if he and his Son did not at first say the Sheep were lost on Sunday Night?
Life. My Son will give an Account that he saw them, and told them on Sunday.
Prisoner. You have said they were lost on Saturday Night.
Life. No - we follow'd them on Monday Morning to Smithfield, and there we found them. The Prisoner lives about half a Mile from the Ground where these Sheep were kept: He looks after Sheep there.

            . I live with Mr. Life. On Sunday Morning I told 53 Sheep in the Field: On Monday Morning Nine were missing: I follow'd the Marks of their Feet Half a Mile into the the Road, and concluding they were gone to Smithfiels, I went thither, and found Mr. Simmonds killing one of them: I knew it, and asked him, if he had any of them alive? He said yes, and shew'd me four mark'd R.L. the Letters across, and a Dot on the near Shoulder: I found likewise five of the Skins there; all of them had the same Marks: I could discover by the Skins, that there were five Ews and four Wedthers. Simmonds told me he bought them all of the Prisoner; upon which I went to his House, and charg'd him with having sold our Sheep, and he offer'd to make any Satisfaction that my Father-in-Law desired. He did not say he took the Sheep, but when I ask'd him if he had any one with him when they were taken, he said no, there was no body but himself, and he said he had sold them to Simmonds.
Prisoner. He said he measur'd the Mark of the Man's Foot in the Field.
Stevenson . I did so: And as I brought the Prisoner along, I measur'd his Foot: The Prisoner's Foot was a little longer than the Mark in the Ground; but the Ground being slippery, his Foot might draw back.

             . I bought five Ews and four Wethers of the Prisoner: They were all mark'd R. L. the Letters cross each other, and a Dot on the near Shoulder: He sold them to me as his own; and he has often come to Market with Sheep: He had eight more, with these which I bought; but they were mark'd with his own Mark.

,
Mr. Deane. I keep The Cross-keys Tavern, in Cornhill






. I lost a Silver Cup, which I value at 35 s. and a Spoon, worth 7 s. I missed them on the 17th of October in the Evening; and I have a Servant here, who saw them that Evening, in the Room where the Prisoner sat. This is the Cup, and this the Spoon, and they are mine The Spoon is broke in two, but I swear 'tis mine.
Prisoner. I would ask this Witness, if he has any Personal Knowledge of me?
Mr. Deane. No: I have none.


                  Gabriel 
                  Sleath 
               



            . I am a Goldsmith: On the 18th of October, about Nine in the Morning, I bought the Spoon of the Prisoner: It was broke in two, just as it is now. I gave him five Shillings and Five-pence an Ounce for it; it came to 10 s. 7d. and I gave him half a Guinea and a Penny. I asked him no Questions, for 'twas broke, and not fit for any Thing, but to melt. I never saw the Prisoner before that time.


                  Samuel 
                  Wood 
               



            . I am a Goldsmith: I bought the Cup of the Prisoner, the same Day Mr. Sleath bought the Spoon, - 'twas the the 18th of October. I gave him 5 s. 6 d. an Ounce, and I think it came to 36 s. 9 d. I did not ask him how he came by it. I am sure the Prisoner is the Man I bought it of.


                  John 
                  Lord 
               



            . I am a Servant to Mr. Deane . The Prisoner came to our House, on Wednesday the 17th of October towards Evening, and called for a Drawer. I shewed him into a Room we call the Nag's Head. He bid me bring him half a Pint of Mountain. I drew him the Wine: He drank a a Glass, and then asked me what he had got in the Larder? I told him several different Things, at last he chose a Whiting. It was dressed, but it did not please his Palate, - it was not over and above good, he said; - so he ordered a poached Egg or two, after he had eat about half the Whiting. I was about the House, and was not at the clearing away of the Things, but I can swear the Cup was brought to him with small Beer, and the Spoon, I believe, was carry'd in with the Whiting. When he called to pay, I told him 15 d. He gave me a Guinea, which I changed, and he gave me 3 d. out of 18 d. for myself. When I went in to him, about the Reckoning, I observed him to be writing upon a Piece of blotted Paper, and he seemed to lean his Head from me. I won't be too positive to him, but I think: have seen him several Times before. I can swear he had on the same Wig, and as near as I can guess, the same Coat. He was at our House between Five and Ten, and I missed the Things about an Hour and a half after he was gone.
Prisoner. I would ask him whether he is certain he ever saw me before?
Lord I think I have seen him at the Mitre Tavern, where I served my Time. I told him last Sunday in Newgate, I had seen him there; and he said, to be sure, Sir, you have.
Prisoner. I would ask him if he was the Person that took the Things away?
Lord . No: When I took the Reckoning of him the Things were all taken away, and the Table brushed clean. There was nothing then upon it, but a Half-pint Decanter, a Decanter of Water, and a large Water Glass.
Prisoner. I am not the Person that conveyed the Things away from Mr. Deane's House; and that is the Substance of what I have to say. The Indictment is laid for a Silver Mug, and they swear to a Cup. There, my Lord, is a manifest Distinction.
Mr. Fruchard . Last August was twelve Months, I was in Want of a Book-keeper, and the Prisoner apply'd to me, and told me he came from a Place called Kimlade in Worcestershire , and shew'd me a Recommendatory Letter from a Gentleman of the Law, - one Mr. Massey , of Shessinghurst . I told him, I should be glad to have a Line from that Gentleman, and he accordingly wrote me a Letter, and gave the Prisoner a good Character: So I took him upon Trial, and he behaved with me, in a very decent Manner, and I thought him religious. He continued with me, but a little while, - about six or seven Weeks, for he had wrote an Essay on the Divine Attributes, (which in some Peoples Judgement, was a very good Piece) and other Poetical Pieces; and I found when he should have been about my Books, his Imagination was in the Clouds. This was the only Reason I parted with him. He has received Money for me, and brought it justly to Account. It is a Par-dox to me, that the Author of such Pieces, as he has wrote, should be an Hypocrite. I would have served him since he he went from me, had I not been obliged to tell him; that his Inclination to Poetry would disqualify him from Merchandizing.

Jeddory. I bought 7 lb. of the Prisoner, and gave him 8 d. a Pound. We sell it again for 9 d. to the Founders.
Rawson. I gave 15 d. a Pound for it myself.
Another . I am Servant to Rawson, and was accidentally drinking with Jeddory, and he told me, and he told me, he had bought some new-cast Brass, which he believ'd was not honestly came by. I desired to see it, and I went to his Shop, and saw it, and knew it to be my Masters. I saw 54 lb. and he told me, he had several Hundreds of it, which he had bought in small Parcels. This Brass is my Master's, and he must give 15 d. a Pound for it, if he was to buy it himself.
Jeddory . I bought it with an Intent to catch the Thief: The Prisoner's Wife used to come with a little Bit now and then. I did not pay for the last Parcel, but went to look for the Thief, and thought I should find him out, by going among the Trade, and describing the Patterns. My Son bought the last Parcel, and told Mr. Rawson's Servant of it.

Mr. Robinson . On the 2d of November, about Six at Night, I was coming through the Temple


, and felt a Hand sliding into my Pocket. I immediately saw the Prisoner with my Handkerchief in his Hand, but he could not get it away, because it was ty'd to my Pocket. I got hold of his Hand; he struggled, and got from me, but the Mob seized him, and pump'd him. Just after this, Mr. Fern lost his Gold Watch, and the Prisoner having been pumped, was taken again, and detained by Mr. Fern: Then I was sent for, and he acknowledged his having attempted to take my Handkerchief, but he said he was not Artist enough to take a Watch.
Prisoner. I was coming thro' Butcher-Row , and the Gentleman's Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket, the People about him, took me and pumped me.

             the 15th of September, between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night, I was robb'd of all the Things mentioned in the Indictment. They were taken out of my Shop in Water Lane, in Fleet-street


. The Shop-door was open at that Time, but the Hatch was lock'd. Tis always lock'd o'Nights. I was gone to Bed, but my Wife was in the Shop, at the same time; though she did not miss the Things till between Seven and Eight the next Morning. On the 24th of October last the Prisoner came into the Shop, (I was present at the same time) and he asked my Wife, if she had not lost some Tea, and two Tea-cannisters? yes. Did not you lose a Coffee-cannister, and some Coffee? Yes. Did not you lose two Brass Candlesticks and a Drudging-box, and Pepper-box? Yes. Did you not lose a light Peruke , and a Poker? Yes. Was not your Money-drawer like to have been broke open? Yes. Why then, Mrs.Foster, I am the Thief. I am not drunk; I come to tell you that I am the Thief, and here I am, and will stay till you get a Constable. My Wife asked him, where she sat when he took the Things; you sat, (said he) asleep by the Fire-side. She told him, she had rather sit down with the Loss, than have any Trouble, and so she bid him take himself away; but he damn'd his Eyes, and said, If you don't prosecute me, I'll prosecute you, and will make it cost you 40 l. he was then very sober, and wrote down an Account of the Things we had lost. Upon this I sent to see for an Officer, but we could not get one, nor find a Magistrate at home, so we let him go about his Business. On the Saturday after I took him again, and carried him before Mr. Alderman Lambert , where he deny'd all.
Prisoner. Do you know that I ever wronged any body of a Farthing?
Mr. Foster. I have known the Prisoner several Years: He is a Fellow that follows the Coal-Carts, he's what they call a Scuffle-hunter, and lives in Hanging-sword-Alley; that's no very good Place.
Tviphena Foster gave the same Account, with only this Variation, That she believed the Prisoner had been drinking, but he was (she said) compos mentis.

             . I know nothing of the Robbery, but I was in the Prosecutor's House when the Prisoner came in and made the Confession (as above.) He told them, They endeavoured to break open the Till with the Poker, but he would not tell who he meant by - They I asked him, if he knew what he was about? yes. Why, (says I) this is a Thing of bad Consequence. I know it, (says he) - I shall go to New Prison. I told him, no, he would go to the Compter: But he said, he knew better, for Evidences went to New Prison, I thought it look'd as if he intended to have made himself an Evidence. He told them, he knew he must go to Prison somewhere, and insisted on their charging a Constable with him, and would not stir out of the House till an Officer came. Upon this I went for a Constable, but the Constable told me, he was busy, and as the Prisoner came voluntarily, we might go with him ourselves before a Magistrate; and we went accordingly to my Lord Mayor's, and to Sir

            's, but they not being at home, the Prosecutor let him go about his Business, and next Day they took him up with a Warrant. I can't say I ever heard he had wrong'd any body, - only he lives in Hanging Sword-Alley with an ill Woman.

             . I was present when the Prisoner told Mrs.Foster he was the Thief; I took hold of his Hand, and told him, I was sorry for it. He mention'd all the Things, and said the Poker was taken with an Intent to break open the Till. I told him, - surely he was suddled; no, he damn'd his Eyes, - he was not: He knew, (he said) what he was about, and said, if they would not take him up, he would prosecute them, and make it cost them 40 l.
Prisoner. I made no Confession at all, and I have Witness to prove, I was not from home that Night they were robb'd. Her Name is

Thomas Sparrow . The Prisoner was a Person who used to do the Business of a Chair-woman
 in my House. I keep my Money in a Chest of Drawers in my Bed-chamber; and on the 3d of June last, I lost out of the Drawer six Guineas and a Moidore. The Lock of the Drawer was pick'd, but not broke. On Sunday the 5th of August, my Wife lay dying at Brumpton , and the Prisoner being employed in my House, I went to see my Wife at Two o'Clock, and returned home at Seven. When I got home, I found two folding Doors between the Dining-Room and my Bed-chamber, (which I had nailed up after the first Robbery) broke open. The next Morning I examined my Drawers in the Bed-chamber, and missed nine Guineas, five 36 Shilling Pieces and a Moidore, which was all the Money I had there, except a Moidore: On the Thursday following, I took her to Task, but she'd confess nothing. No, said she, - confess and be hanged. Upon this I turned her out of Doors , and bid her be gone about her Business. On the Sunday following I was sent for to her Lodging, and she confessed she took my Money , and to clear her Husband of being concerned with her, she owned she put the Money in his Pocket. I had lost twenty Pounds all but four Shillings. She owned taking the Money, but said it was not quite so much, and she hoped I would be favourable . Her Husband asked her, - No , do I know any thing of the Money's being taken? No (she said) I took it, and put it into your Pocket.

            . I was present when the Money was found by her Husband in the Pockets of a Pair of Breeches of his, which lay in a Chest in their Lodging. Mr. Groom found it himself, and was vastly surprised: 'Twas in two Papers in the Breeches Pockets; there was nine Guineas, a Thirty-six Shilling Piece, a Moidore, and eighteen Shillings in Silver. He sent for Mr. Sparrow , and delivered it to him, while the Prisoner lay upon the Bed, and to all Appearance was dying: For after Mr. Sparrow had turn'd her off, on account of this Robbery, she came home, and got blooded, and having opened the Bandage, she let herself bleed almost to Death. When her Husband found this out, he sent for me, and wondering what could induce her to do such a Thing, I told him she was charged with this Robbery: He searched, and found the Money. I never heard her speak till after she was taken up.

             . I was present when the Money was found: The Prisoner at that time had lost so much Blood, that we all thought she had been dead. I sat up with her all Night, and the next Morning she spoke: Her Husband , she said, knew nothing of the Money, but she had put it into his Breeches Pocket, unknown to him. On the Sunday following Mr. Sparrow asked her , if it was his Money? She told him it was; and Mr. Sparrow said, if she had owned it when he first earned her with it at his own House, he would not have taken her up.

            . I live at Mr. Bradbury's, in Bishops-Court


 in the Old Baily. On the 27th of October, the Prisoner (who used to go on Errands in the House) came up into my Room with a Gold Ring enamel'd, upon her Finger. I asked her, whose it was? She said, it was Mrs. Renward's. I bid her carry it down Stairs again, and put it into Mrs. Renward's Room. She went down, and said she would do so. After this Renward gave her a Guinea to fetch her a Gill of Wine, and she not returning again, I was employ'd to search after her. The third Time I was at her Lodging, I found her, and she had deck'd herself up very handsomely. I ask'd her, where the Rings were? She told me, she knew nothing of them. As I had seen one of them before upon her Finger, I got Mr. Jones at the Elephant and Castle in Fleet Lane, to take Charge of her; and then she acknowledged, she had taken one of them. I took her at her Lodging over against the Three Daggers upon Saffron-Hill.

             . I happen'd to be taken ill that Day, and sent the Prisoner, with a Guinea, to fetch me a Gill of Wine. She not returning, I suspected she had done me some other Mischief, and upon looking in my Drawers, I miss'd a Mourning Ring, and another with a Ruby and two Diamonds. Upon this I sent Gulliford to look after her: He found her, and brought her to me, and she own'd she took my Mourning Ring, (inscrib'd -

Mrs. Robins. I live in Knight-Rider-Street


. My House was not broke open, but the Window that goes down into the Cellar was wrench'd, October the 8th. It was fast as we could make it, but it had receiv'd such Damage by a Cart, that any one might get into it, provided the Bars and the Iron-work should be wrench'd. The Bars I found wrench'd, and I suppose the Prisoner got into my House that Way. I lost between Three and Four Pounds out of a Cupboard in the Back Counting-house. I had bolted the Door at the Top of the Stairs (that lead into the House) myself, when I went to Bed, but I found it open. The Counting-house Door was latch'd, but not lock'd. In the Morning I found the Lock upon the Cupboard wrench'd, and it hung only by one Nail. The Prisoner was my Servant, and I suspect him, because I sent him out on an Errand that Night' and he took the best of his Cloaths away with him. My Son, another Servant and I, sat up for him, but he did not (as we know of) come home that Night, and next Morning I found the Money gone, and the Door at the Top of the Cellar Stairs, and the Cupboard Door broke open, and my Money gone. My Husband at this Time was out of Town.

            . On the 8th of October, at Night, Mrs. Robins desired me to shut up her Shop, because the Prisoner (she said) was gone out with Candles. About Eleven o'Clock I saw him at her Door, and told him his Mistress sat up for him: He did not care to knock at the Door, so I told him, I would. No, says he, you shall not, - I'll get down the Cellar Window. The Iron Bars were fell so much, that any body might get down, and he said he would sit in the Cellar till his Master Franky (his Mistress's Son) got up; and so down he got directly, but I know nothing of his getting out again. He was taken about seventeen Days afterwards, and was carried before Mr. Adderman Parsons.
Prisoner. Was the Family a bed when I got in?
Pearce. No; the Clock had not gone Eleven. Madam was sitting up for him then.

            . I was one of the Persons that took him. I know nothing of the Robbery, but one Mr. Major, an Acquaintance of Mr. Robin's , happen'd to see the Prisoner at Hoxton ; he ran after him till he was tired, then he cry'd Stop Thief, and I took him. Mr. Major told me he had robb'd his Master; to which the Prisoner made (at that Time) no Answer: But when we got him into Mr. Weaver's House at Hoxton, he own'd he had taken Three Pound in Silver, but did not mention from what Place he took it. We asked him, What he had done with it? He said, he had spent it. We sent for his Master, as soon as we had taken him, and he asked him, how he could serve him so? The Prisoner cry'd, and said, he was sorry for it.
John Chitham's Evidence was to the same Effect.

.
Mr. Arnold. I am a Painter
, and live in Covent-Garden . On the 29th of last Month, between Six and Seven o'Clock at Night, I was coming out of the City, and two Doors above Milford-Lane, near Arundel-street in the Strand


, the Prisoner forced between me and the Houses. I turn'd, and ask'd him what he wanted, and would have given him the Way. My Watch was then in my Fob; but a second Man came immediately up on the other Side of me, and the Prisoner and the second Man held me, while a Third took my Watch out of my Fob* . Then they all three ran away, and I cry'd out, Stop Thief! The Prisoner turn'd down Arundel-street , and I pursu'd him till I was out of Breath, and could run no longer, but
 *The Prisoner was indicted only for a Single Felony; as it appears upon this Evidence, he might bavcharg'd with a Street Robbery. he was follow'd by others who overtook him and seiz'd him, and he was search'd directly, yet we found nothing upon him, except an old Razor. The other two got quite away. I am positive the Prisoner was the Man who held me by my left Arm, and I charged him with being an Accomplice as soon as he was taken. Indeed I think he is in some Measure accessary to the Loss of it; and 'tis very hard a Man can't walk the Streets of London, - 'tis a very hard Case. We carry'd the Prisoner before Colonel De Veil, and there he would confess nothing, only he said he had a Being in Rag fair; but when he was at the Roundhouse , he said his Being was in Broad St Giles's. I have advertis'd the Watch, and offer'd twelve Guineas for it again, but have not had it, and as for the Seal, I could not have such a one for two Guineas. In short, he's the Man that laid Hands on me first, and held me till the two others came up; and what could I do? They might have knock'd down three such little Fellows as I am.

            . I am Apprentice to Mr. Darves , a Bricklayer, in Holborn, and happen'd (at the Time the Gentleman lost his Watch) to be coming through Arundel-street . There was a Cry of Stop Thief, and the Prisoner running very fast, I clapp'd my Hands round his Waist, and stopp'd him: He made no Resistance, though he had a Stick, but said the Fellow is gone this Way, and I was going after him, The Gentleman came presently up to us, and charg'd him with being an Accomplice of those who stole his Watch.
DEFENCE.

            . I have liv'd with the Prisoner ever since last Christmas. He keeps a Lodging-house next Door but two to the Hay field, the upper End of Rag-fair, and he has a Child that I look after in his House. I went to see a Friend, and staid out with the Child all Night at one Mr. James's in Belton street , St. Giles's. The Prisoner came there next Day, to see for us, and between Six and Seven next Evening we were coming home down the Strand, and there being a Crowd of People, he endeavour'd to push along, to make Way for me, and the Child who was asleep in my Arms. I had hold of his Arm at the same time, but I let it go in the Crowd, that he might push through. At the same time I heard a Cry of Stop Thief, and stood still a little while, but having lost the Prisoner in the Crowd, I went home, and next Morning I heard - he was in Trouble.

I have known him between six and seven Years; he has been a House-keeper in one Parish for some time, and now he keeps a Lodging-house , and as far as I have heard, he bears a good Character. He kept the Ship in Bowl-Yard, and The Plough and Harrow in St. Thomas's street, and now he lives at the other End of the Town.

JOHN WHITE
was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of October, 20 sovereigns, the monies of 



William Sturgess, his master.






WILLIAM STURGESS.
I am a publican, and live in North-street, Fitzroysquare. The prisoner was a fortnight and a few days in my employ, as waiter and potman—on the 25th of October I gave him twenty sovereigns to get changed in the neighbourhood for silver—he did not return—I found him at the station-house last Monday week.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX.
I am a policeman. I was looking for the prisoner from the 25th of October until last Monday week, when I apprehended him at his father's—I told him I took him for robbing Mr. Sturgess of 20l., and what he said to me would be given in evidence—he said, "Never hello"—I said, "What has become of the money? "—he said it was all spent long ago, and on the way to the station-house he said he would have had 100l. if he could have got it.

Prisoner. That part of his statement is false. Witness. It is true—there was a pistol and shot found in his bed-room at the prosecutor's.

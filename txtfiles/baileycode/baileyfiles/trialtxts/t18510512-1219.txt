MESSRS. CLARKSON

HUDDLESTON
conducted the Prosecution,






THOMAS TURNER
 I am a draper, at Cuckfield, in Sussex. In April or May, 1849, I sent a silver watch, by my brother Joseph, to Mr. Cragg, of London, to be repaired—I saw that same watch in the possession of Carpenter, before the Magistrate, about two months ago.





JOSEPH TURNER
. I am a carpenter, and live in London. On 24th April, 1849, I received from my brother Thomas a silver watch, and two others—I took them to Mr. Cragg's, of Northampton-square, Clerkenwell, to be repaired, and delivered them to the foreman, Mr. Botten.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLETT
Q. How many watches did you take? A. Three—they were all silver.





JOSIAH BOTTEN
 I am foreman to Mr. Cragg, of Northampton-square, In April, 1849, I received three watches from last witness—I afterwards packed them in a parcel, and sent them by George Cragg to Mr. Low, in the Minories.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. How long had you the watches? A. A fortnight—I can swear that the three I received from Turner were the three I sent to Mr. Low—I kept them in an iron safe with a great many others—we keep a book with the number and the description of the watches—that book is not here.





GEORGE CRAGO
 I am nephew to Mr. Cragg. On 9th or 10th May, 1849, I taw three watches made into a parcel at my uncle's factory—they were for Mr. Turner, of Ditchley—I took them to Mr. Low, of 3, Minories, and gave them to some person there—it was a brown-paper parcel, and addressed, "Mr. Turner, Ditchley."

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Who was the person from whom you received it? A. Mr. Botten—I saw him do up the watches—there were three—it was on a Wednesday.





ISAAC FURMER
 I am manager to Mr. Josiah Low, a clothier, of 3, Minories. I recollect a parcel being brought from Mr. Cragg's on 9th May—it was a brown-paper parcel, not very large—I had seen him that day, and sold him a variety of articles, thirty-three pairs of trowsers, nineteen waist-coats, five jackets, and five coats—those goods were made up into a truss, and the parcel from Mr. Cragg's was enclosed in it—it was directed, "To Mr. Edw. Turner, Ditchley; to be left at the Hassock's station"—Robert Lynch, the porter, took it away to the station.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Did you do up the truss yourself? A. I helped to do it, and the porter—I saw Mr. Cragg's parcel put in; it was a squareish parcel, it had the appearance of a box being inside—our house is not far from Rosemary-lane.





ROBERT LYNCH
 I assisted in packing a parcel for Mr. Turner, of Ditchley, in May last—I took it to the Dean-street station of the London and Brighton Railway Company—I took my delivery-book with me (producing it), and the person to whom I gave the parcel gave me this acknowledgment. JOHN SMITH On 10th May, 1849, I was in the service of the London,

Brighton, and South-Coast Railway, at their receiving-house, Dean-street, Tooley-street—I produce the receiving-book, in which I take a description of the goods I receive—I find an entry, on 10th May, in my writing, "I truss, Turner, of Ditchley, from Low, Minoriet; 1cwt 7 lbs."—it was sent the same night, by the company's van, to the Bricklayers' Arms station—I find in this book of Lynch's my signature, acknowledging the parcel—this (produced) is the way-bill I sent that day.





EDWARD TURNER
 I am a draper, of Ditchley (the other Mr. Turner it my brother). I bought some goods of Mr. Low, of the Minories, and ordered them to be sent to me—they did not come—on the same day I purchased some lace, net, and shawls, of Messrs. Bridges, Gresham-street—I marked them with my own mark, and directed them to be sent to Messrs. Hinds, Milk-street, where I was going to buy other articles—I never got them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Have you any partner? A. No—I looked out the actual goods at Mr. Low's; I did not mark them all; I marked all I bought at Mr. Bridge's.





JOHN BUTCHER
 I am in the service of Stephen Bridget, of Wood-street. In May, 1849, he carried on business in Gresham-street—Mr. Turner purchased some lace, shawls, and nets of me—they were tent to Messrs. Hinds', Milk-street, by Charles Reynolds, the porter.





CHARLES REYNOLDS
. I received a parcel from Batcher, and took it to Messrs. Hinds'.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNBLL
Q. You find something about it in that book? A. Yes; the entry is "Turner, Ditchley."





WILLIAM THOMAS
 I am packer to Hind, Parker, and Co., of Gresham-street, and was so in 1849—I made up a truss, containing gloves, socks, hose, and braces; it was directed, "E. Turner, Ditchley, Brighton Railway, Hassock's station"—I packed with it a parcel I received from Messrs. Bridges, and took it to the Swan with Two Necks.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Have you any particular recollection of putting into this truss anything which came from Messrs. Bridges? A. I have a memorandum of it, which I have referred to.





ALFRED JINKS
 I am in the service of Messrs. Chaplin and Home—I produce my receiving-book—I find, by an entry in my own writing, on 10th May, 1849, that I received a truss at the Swan with Two Necks from Messrs. Hinde Parker, and Co., for Turner, of Ditchley—it was sent by Allen, the guard of the South-Coast Railway Company, the same day, to the Bricklayers' Arms station.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Was anything paid upon it? A. Merely the booking—the carriage was not paid, or it would have been inserted in the book. RICHARD ALLEM
did not appear






BARNARD HATTRED
 On 10th May, 1849, I was in the service of the Brighton Railway Company—I received a number of packages from a man named Allen that day—there was one directed to Turner, of Ditchley—I saw my man weigh it; it weighed 2 cwt. 20 lbs.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN
Q. Do you recollect the direction on the other parcels? A. No; it is a considerable time ago—I recollect this one, because I had to answer a report about it next morning from Hassock's-gate—my man weighed the parcels, and I checked them with the bill, and I recollect making an alteration in it—it was placed about the centre of the truck, with three or four others—I did not see it sheeted down; there was another truss for Mr. Turner there.


Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Did you see the train go off? A. No; the truck was not standing in a corner, it was on the next line to the train which was going off, and within a yard of it





THOMAS PUNNETT
. I am employed in the goods' department, Bricklayers' Arms station. On the day in question I loaded a truss directed to Turner, of Ditchley, which came from Dean-street station; it weighed 1 cwt. 7 lbs.—I also loaded in the same truck another truss, which came from the Swan with Two Necks, weighing 2 cwt. 20 lbs.—I saw the truck sheeted down and tied with strings—the train started about eleven o'clock at night.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Did you see it go off? A. No; I saw it all in readiness; nothing had been done to the sheeting then—it would be in the watchman's charge till it started—I last saw it between nine and ten o'clock—there is no one here who saw it later.





JOHN WEST BIGLIN
 I am station-clerk, at Hassock's-gate Railway Station. Between six and eight o'clock, on the morning of 11th May, I examined the luggage-truck which came from London—I found by the way-bill that there were two trusses short for Mr. Turner.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Did the sheeting appear to have been disturbed? A. No; it was just as usual—it had been there three or four hours when I examined it, the guard was not there then—Hassock's-gate is forty-three miles from town—I had charge of the station.





JOHN CARPENTER
 (police-sergeant, R 38.) On 15th Feb., in consequence of something, I went with a man named Owen to a house at Marsh-end, Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire—I saw a person named Griffin in the house—I searched it—I found a great many articles of all descriptions in the shop, five pairs of boy's braces, seven pairs of men's—they were shown to Mr. Thomas—I found two waistcoats in a box, which were shown to Furmer—on the following Friday I went to William, about two miles and a half from Newport Pagnell, and saw Abbott at a house there—I asked him if be knew George Pearson Barrett, he said he did—I asked him if he had heard he was in trouble—he said, "Yes;" I asked if he had had a letter from him; he said he had—I told him I was an officer, and he need be very careful what answers he made me, as I should have to use them against him in another place—I asked him what goods he had had from Greorge Barrett at different times—he said he had had no goods of him—I asked him if he meant to say he had had nothing from him—he said, "I had a couple of handkerchiefs, and a pair of braces, nothing else,"—I said I must search his house, as there were a great many things that had been stolen by Barrett which had not been found—I asked him if he was not a hawker, and if he did not carry a pack—he said he was not, and he did not carry a pack—I searched a bedroom in his presence, and found in a watch-pocket, at the head of the bed, this watch (produced)— I opened it, turned to Abbott, and said, "This is a stolen watch; it is one of three watches stolen out of a truss of goods"—he said, "My brother William, who is dead, had it of George Barrett;" his sister, who was there, said, "Yes"—he said he was sorry for what he had said to me before about not having more things of Barrett, that he had told me a lie, and if he had known what it was coming to he would not have done it, and that he would tell me all the dealings he had had with him—he mentioned about a dozen persons to whom he had sold goods, and said he would go with me to them, and render me every assistance he could, and he was sorry he had not done so in the first instance; and that he had sold lengths of cloth, tweed, gown-pieces, and some coats to them—he said Barrett was his brother-in-law; that he was not a hawker, for he did not dispose of the things, he did not take them

until he had got an order for them—I asked him if he bad got any license for hawking; he said no, and he never had one—he said the first thing he ever had of Barrett was about two years ago, a box of drapery; and he bad continued to have things from him until the present time, but not so much lately as he had done before, and if be had known how he came by the goods, he should have had nothing to do with them—I showed him eight pairs of braces which I bad from Mr. Sykes, a tailor, of Newport Pagnell, who said he had made up several pieces of cloth for him and his two brothers-in-law—he said, "These are part of a dozen of braces which I had of George Barrett"—on 25th March I went to Enoch Barrett, Gilbert-street, Deptford—I saw his wife, and then found him in his bedroom getting up—I told him the affair of his brother had become very serious, and I had come again to search his house, and he must consider himself in custody, and must be careful what answers he gave, as I should have to use them against him—he turned to his wife and said, "We had better tell the whole truth about this affair"—I searched the bedroom, and found these braces and this waistcoat in his clothes-box—in his jacket pocket I found four whistles, of different notes—on 24th Feb., Abbott was brought to the Greenwich Police-station—he was in there, in George Barrett's presence—he said, "I am brought here about that watch my brother William bad of you"—Barrett said, "There is nothing wrong about that, I know"—I said, "Yes; he is brought here about a watch, and this is it"—producing it to him—he said, "This watch is all right, for I bought it of a man at the corner of Rosemary-lane, more than two years ago" I said it was stolen, and belonged to Mr. Turner, of Ditch ley—he said, "I don't believe it—I know it is nothing of the sort; I bought it honestly"—I said, "Do you know the person you bought it of?"—he said, "No; it is more than two years ago"—I opened it, and showed it to him—he said, "Yes; that is the watch"—I said, "It was stolen out of a truss of goods that were sent to the Brighton Railway"—I found in George Barrett's house these three pieces of what has been a guard—it is of the same material as this guard on the watch, also some, wrappers, such as are used for packing trusses,—one of them has on it, "Mr. Barrett, Abbey-end, Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire "—in Enoch Barrett's bedroom I found a piece of cloth, and a piece of white lace, which were spoken to by Mr. Butcher—also in a cupboard, in the back kitchen, this rope, which is one of the sheet-cords attached to the trains.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. You give it as your judgment that these two pieces of guard correspond? A. Yes; that they formerly were one guard—this is not now as long as ladies use their guards—I found six dozen of braces at George Barrett's—Mr. Thomas only speaks to some of them—his wife kept a little hosiery shop—nobody knew what he was—there were three or four second-hand gowns in the shop.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN. Q. Was not what Enoch said, "We had better tell the truth about the things we had of George?"—A. He said that afterwards, and the wife directly said she had them for his board and lodging—the things were all of a heap, and the two pairs of braces, and the waistcoat with them—and he said, "These are what George brought."

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLBTT
Q. Did you take down the conversation in writing? A. I made a few little memorandums—I have not got them with me—when I first asked him whether he had had any goods of George Barrett, he said he had had none—I asked him a second time, he then hesitated a moment, and said he had had two or three little things—I saw Abbott's two sisters at the house, and his father, who is the parish-clerk and

post-master—I cannot say whether I found the watch in the room of one of the sisters; there were women's dresses in all the rooms up-stairs—I took a pair of women's boots from under the bed—I inquired, and found Abbott to be a very good character—the Magistrate, who is the minister of William, said he was never so surprised in his life—William is fifty-eight miles from here.





JAMES PEDDER
 I am porter, at the Hassock's station. I was not there when the train came in on the morning of the 11th—I went there about a quarter-past six—I then went to look over the goods, to check them off according to the invoices; after doing that, I had charge of the truck.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Did you do it at the same time as Mr. Biglin? A. Before, somewhere about the same time.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN
Q. Was there more than one truck left there that morning? A. No; I cannot say how many trusses there were in the truck—I removed the sheeting before Mr. Biglin came up—it was only on examining the contents of it that I discovered anything missing—the sheeting and everything was all regular.

COURT
Q. When you examined it, was the cord of the truck cut? A. No.





MATTHEW OWEN
 I am inspector of police, in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company. In Feb. last I went to Newport Pagnell, and took Carpenter with me—I assisted in searching the house at Marsh-end—I saw Mrs. Griffin there—on a drawer at that house I found this card, with a portion of lace on it—I also found a box belonging to Pearson, of Canterbury, and some things relating to a robbery committed at Hailing Pearce and Stones—I found two or three skeleton-keys in a box—I have not got them here.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. How long had George Barrett been in custody when that card was found? A. I cannot say exactly, perhaps a few days; I think not a fortnight or three weeks.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLETT
Q. Were you present at the conversation with Abbott? A., Yes; he at first said he had bad no dealings with George Barrett, he subsequently said he had had two or three little things.





HANNAH GRIFFIN
 I am the wife of Samuel Griffin. I know George Pearson Barrett—I know the house the constable searched, at Marsh-end—he had never occupied the house, his wife occupied it—I have not seen George Barrett there—he lived at Abbey-end, but was moving to Marsh-end—his goods were moved.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. How long had he and Mrs. Barrett been living at this place? A. I do not know how long, about a year and a half—he kept a little shop for the sale of second-hand clothes, hosiery, and goods of that description—his friends and relations have always lived there—it is his native place—some of his relations are living there now—I am sure that George Barrett had never been in the house where the card was found—as far as I know, he has conducted himself respectably—he lived there before, and I lived next-door to him for some time.





WILLIAM ACTON
 I am superintendent of police, in the service of the London, Brighton, and South-coast Railway Company. Enoch Barrett was in their service, as switchman and signal-man—he was so in May, 1849—he had been for a long time performing his duty at a junction from the Bricklayers' Arms station to the main line—in that position he would have the power of stopping the goods-train at any time he thought right—it would be his duty to see that the line was clear—he would stop a train in the night by

putting on a red light, and by a red flag in the daytime—goods-trains travel at night—George Barrett is the brother of Enoch—he was also in the Company's employment—he was so part of May, but not the whole of it—I cannot say whether he was about the 9th or 10th; he was at the beginning and latter part.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN
Q. How long has Enoch Barrett been in the Company's employ? A. I have known him there about five years, but he has been longer than that—he had received a gratuity from the Company for good conduct, in Jan. last—it would be necessary for him to be at his post, at the switches, when the train was coming out—his hands would be employed, and his feet also—there is a guard to the goods-trains, an engine-driver, and a fireman—I cannot tell who was the guard on that night—I have endeavoured to ascertain, but could not—there is not more than one switchman on duty at the same time at that place—a person named George Wood was the other—he is now employed on another part of the line—I cannot say that he was not switchman at that time—if a train is delayed for any considerable time, the guard would have to make a report to the station-master—the guard would never leave the train he has charge of—his seat is in the last carriage—he could not command a view of the whole train—I do not know the number of carriages that were in the train that night—I never knew of a goods-train with so little as three carriages, or even ten or twenty—the reports were made verbally; they could be made to the head manager, Mr. Hawkins—I heard of the loss of this parcel immediately afterwards—I do not know that any inquiry was made at to who was the guard on the train that night—the first inquiry was in the hands of Carpenter; it did not come into my hands till 13th Feb. this year.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLIETT
Q. You were before the Magistrate? A. Yes; Abbott was let out on bail—I was examined on the last trial—Abbott was then allowed to go out on his own recognizance.

MR. CLARKSON
Q. The goods-trains generally consist of a vast number of carriages, do they not? A. Yes, they are very heavy trains—it would be easy while one man stopped the train, for another to take a parcel out—that train sometimes stops at Hay ward's-heath, when it has goods for there—if there were no goods for Hayward's-heath, it would go right through—there is another short train, which takes the intermediate stations.

MR. PARNELL
Q. How long would it take to undo the tarpaulin, remove a truss weighing a hundredweight, and re-place the tarpaulin? A. I think it might be done in two minutes—I think I could do it in less time—there is nothing in the way—the string is cut, the corner of the sheet thrown up, and it is out in an instant—they do not stop to untie it often—we have had a great many cuts.





THOMAS PUNNETT

re-examined The truck might be left halt-an-hour, or not so long, after it was fastened up, before the trains started, as soon as they could get the carriages on—I packed the train that night, between nine and ten o'clock—it would leave the station about a quarter before eleven—it would remain a very few minutes in the siding, because the engine would go in, and bring it out at once—there were, I should say, about forty or fifty trucks that night—50l. was about twenty from the engine.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN
Q. Have you any recollection of the train that night? A. No; I cannot say how many trucks there were—I cannot say who was the guard—there were two or three, one to each train—I cannot say whether there were one or two that night—the sheeting was put on by two men, between nine and ten o'clock—I did not see it after that, till it

went—there were not a number of men about, only me and Bloxam—other trucks were sheeted—the two men left as soon as they had sheeted the trucks; I cannot say what time that was—a man named Copeling had charge of them till they left—he had a horse to run them out of the siding—he is now at the Bricklayers' Arms.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNBLL
Q. What is the furthest point to which this train goes? A. To Hastings and Portsmouth; the Hassock's-gate station would probably be the first at which it would stop—those that stop first are placed next the engine, and then detached.





THOMAS TURNER

re-examined This is my watch, and the one I sent to Mr. Craig's to be mended.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Is there anything particular by which you know it? A. There is a very particular mark in the dial-plate, and the initials "F. R." on the back—when it was shown to me, I looked at that to ascertain that it was my watch—it is rather a particular make, and I know it by its general appearance—I have not the least doubt it is mine.





ISAAC FURMER

re-examined These three waistcoats, produced by Carpenter, are the manufacture of Mr. Low—two of them have "Newport Pagnell" marked on them—I have no doubt these are a portion of the waist-coats which I sold to Mr. Turner in May—this buff-quilting waistcoat, found at Enoch Barrett's, is the same description as those I sold—I have no doubt this is the jacket I sold Mr. Turner, there is a peculiar make about it—we make a great many.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN
Q., In May or June, 1849, can you say how many of this description of waistcoats might have left Mr. Low's shop? A. I cannot; we never had two dozen at any time—there is one in stock now—this might have been sold out of the shop, I do not say it was not.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. Do you mean to say, this is an uncommon pattern (those found at George Barrett's)? A. No; we have not made thousands of them—one piece would make about three dozen—we have not had above three dozen of that pattern—I have a distinct recollection of the pattern, and have no doubt that some of that pattern were included in Mr. Turner's parcel—I do not undertake to swear positively that it was made at Mr. Low's, but to the best of my belief it was, from the peculiarity of the make and cut—there is no private mark.

MR. HUDDLESTON
Q. In the waistcoats you sold to Mr. Turner, were there three of these patterns? A. I have no doubt there were similar patterns and similar pieces.





EDWARD TURNER

re-examined Here is my private mark on this card—it it in pencil—I made it at the time I purchased it from Mr. Bridges—it is my general practice to do so, and I have no doubt I did so then—I am quite sure this mark was made by me—it is a mark of what the article costs—I only bought one other parcel, and that I did not mark.





JOHN BUTCHER

re-examined The figure "3" on this card of lace is my writing—I see the joiner's mark, "five dozen"—I am sure that card came from our warehouse; I have got the journal here—I find, that on 9th May I sold Mr. Turner some Paris whisker, No. 3, at 12 1/2 d.—this is the same kind of lace that I sold him on that occasion—I also sold him floss fine quilting of this description—I also sold him a nine eight bobbin net of this description—this was found at Enoch Barrett's—I am sure I sold to Mr. Turner goods of this description.





WILLIAM THOMAS

re-examined These five pairs of braces are of the same quality and description as those I sold to Mr. Turner; I did not sell them,

but I packed them—a dozen pairs of boys braces were sent, of the same quality and description as these three pairs produced—these mens cotton braces are of the same quality as were sent to Mr. Turner's—I sent articles of these three descriptions in the same parcel on 9th May—they are of a very common description.

MR. PARNELL
submitted, that there was no proof of the offence having been committed within the jurisdiction of this Court. The
RECORDER
was of opinion, that unless the Jury thought the goods were stolen at the point of junction where Enoch Barrett had charge of the line, the Indictment could not be supported,





JOHN CARPENTER

re-examined The junction is about a mile and a btlf from the Bricklayers' Arms, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford, on this side of the Grand Junction Canal—I know the bounds of the parish, I have walked over them once or twice.

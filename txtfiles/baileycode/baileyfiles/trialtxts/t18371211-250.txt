JOHN LANE SCORE
. I live with my mother, at No. 2, Elliot's Court, Old Bailey. On Wednesday week the prisoner came to my house to lodge and sleep—on Saturday morning I was called up and found he had gone—I missed my trowsers, waistcoat, and all these things—I had left them on a chair in the same room as he slept in—I slept in the same room.





MARGARET SCORE
. I am the mother of John Ravenscroft. I went to call my son on the morning of the 2nd—his clothes were gone, and the prisoner too—I found him at eleven o'clock in the morning in the Old Bailey—I seized him, and asked him how he could do such a thing, he said it was a mistake—I took him to my house, and the policeman came—he took off my son's clothes which the prisoner had on, and put on his own—his clothes were not so good as my son's.

WILLIAM MARLBOROUGH
. I live in Plumber-street, City-road. The prisoner was in my employ eight years, on and off—my watch hung on a nail, in my workshop on the 5th of August—I went out a little while, and when I returned the prisoner and the watch were gone—I met the prisoner in the afternoon, and charged him with stealing the watch—he said it was not pawned, but the party it was with had made away with it; and if I had not acted as I had done I might have had it again.





JAMES REDWOOD
. I am an officer, The prisoner was given to me in charge—his master asked him what he had done with the watch, whether he had pawned it or not—he said he had not pawned it, but made away with it altogether.

Prisoner's Defence. I went out to tea at a quarter before four o'clock, and my master came and met me in Long-lane, and laid hold of me—I said, "Don't choak me, I don't know any thing about the watch"—he said, if I would give him the watch, or tell him where it was, he would not hurt me.

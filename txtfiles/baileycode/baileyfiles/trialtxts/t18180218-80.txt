, and live at Brentford


. On the 27th of January, when I went to work at seven o'clock in the morning, I missed my two spades; suspecting the prisoner, I went to his mother; she said, he had not been at home all night. I traced him out of my ground, and went after him to some labouring men, who were digging gravel, and found my spades.

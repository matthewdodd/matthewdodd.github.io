THOMAS WHITE



, stealing 3 shillings, 1 sixpence, and 4 pence, the moneys of 



Frederick Cordeux, from the person of 



Sarah Cordeux, having been before convicted.






SARAH CORDEUX
. I am the wife of Frederick Cordeux, of the Old Kent-road. On 31st Jan., about six o'clock in the evening. I was at the pit-door of the Victoria Theatre—I saw the prisoner come close by my side—I put my hand in my pocket, and missed three shillings, a sixpence, and four pence, which were loose—the prisoner was gone directly—a policeman asked me if I had lost anything—I told him the sum—I am sure the prisoner was close by me.





JAMES ELPHICK
 (policeman.) I was on duty at the Theatre, and watched the prisoner and another, who were standing close by Mr. Cordeux—there was a rush, the man behind the prisoner was pushed away, and I saw his hand come from her pocket—I did not see it in it—the pocket was partly exposed—he rushed into the Theatre with the crowd—it would cost him 6d. to go in.





WILLIAM COOMES
 (policeman.) I went after the prisoner, and found him at six o'clock next morning, at a coffee-house, where he sleeps—I charged him with the robbery—he said he was not near the Victoria Theatre.





ROBERT FENNING
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Aug., 1845, of stealing money from the person, and confined six months)—he is the person.

            . I am the daughter of James Harris, of Whitechapel-road


. On the 5th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went into the back parlour - my mother said there was a man in the shop; I ran after him, and he turned up an alley - I saw him stopped - he threw away this watch; the gentleman who picked it up is not here.

            . I am a headborough. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and took the prisoner into custody - Miss Harris said he had taken this watch: he said he had been there purchasing a pair of stockings, and Miss Harris cried Stop thief! that he ran after a man, and they took him.

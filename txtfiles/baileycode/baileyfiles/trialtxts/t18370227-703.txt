JOHN CARROLL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
10th of February, 6 hats, value 5l. 8s.; 6 caps, value 6s.; and 1 box, value 3s.; the goods of 



Joseph Stainburn and another.






JOSEPH STAINBURN
. I live in Southwark-square, in the Borough, and am a hat maker. I am in partnership with William Bolland—these hats are mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Are you swearing to these or to the paper in which they are? A. I swear to the marks on the paper—I had seen them the evening before they were lost—I did not give them out—they were going to a customer at Cambridge—when I sell hats I always send them out in that way—I can swear to these hats being in our warehouse the day before, by the name of "Palmer" on them, the person we sold them to.





THOMAS HORSFIELD
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I had a truck

with two boxes in it which contained hats—I left home with it about seven o'clock on Friday, the 10th of February—somebody came and told me of a box being gone—I then missed one of them.

Cross-examined. Q. you were carrying these in a box? A. I was drawing the truck up a gateway, and I was told my box was out of the truck, and on the ground—it could not have fallen out as it was in the bottom.





RICHARD BAKER
. I am servant to Mr. Scoles, who keeps the Elephant inn, Cripplegate. About eight o'clock that evening I saw Honfield draw the truck up the gateway—I saw the prisoner walk up, and take the box out of the truck—he was coming away, when I secured him with it.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that when you took him he had it on him? A. I took him by the collar, and it dropped from his hand.

ISAAC JOSCELYNE
. I am a tailor, and live in Shoreditch. On the morning of the 10th of July I put a summer coat at my door—I missed it in about an hour—it was brought back by my shopman, and this now produced is it.





ROBERT SCALES
. I am a letter-sorter in the Post-office. I was near the prosecutor's door that morning—I saw the prisoner and another lad together—they went to Mr. Joscelyne's shop, and sat down a little while—the prisoner then changed his apron with the other—the other then took the coat off the horse, and the prisoner ran away with it.

Prisoner I was at work at Woolwich that day, seven miles from here.




GUILTY
.** Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a grocer
, and live in Golden-lane


. At ten o'clock on the evening of the 30th of October I was in my back parlour, and saw the prisoner come into my shop - I had seen him before, but not in my shop; he snatched up a pair of scales, and ran off - I followed, and caught him a few yards from the door; he dropped the scales - I know them to be mine: he ran very well, and spoke like a sober man - these are the scales.
Prisoner's Defence. I was intoxicated - I had drank a great deal of liquor; if I had been sober I should not have done it.

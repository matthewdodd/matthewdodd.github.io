JAMES TIMOTHY BRADY
. I met the prisoner in Whitechapel-road, on the 24th of September—she asked where I was going—I said, "Home"—she said, "You had better come home with me; I have got a room of my own"—I went with her, and sat down—she asked if I was going to give her any thing to drink—I sent her for some gin—she came up and drank it, and then took the things down, and came up and said, "What have you got in your pocket?"—I said, "What is that to you?"—I had put my watch and other things in my handkerchief in my pocket; and no sooner had I said the words than she took the handkerchief out of my pocket, and she ran down stairs—I did not see her again till the policeman had taken her—this is my watch, and key, and guard—I live in Johnson's-exchange and was steward of the Dart steam-boat.

Prisoner. He had no money, and gave me the watch till the morning, Witness. No, I had 1l. 15s. in my pocket—I was in the house half as hour—I gave her 1s. to buy the gin—as she was going out of the room, I told her if she would give me the watch I would give her 5s.—I owed her no money—I agreed to give her 2s.—I did not give her that—she did not take the watch because I did not give her the 2s.





RICHARD COOPER
 (police-constable H 85.) I took the prisoner—I said I wanted her to go to the watch-house with me—she refused—I accused her of stealing the watch—the denied it—as she was going along Rose lane, she put her hand to her bosom, took the watch out, and threw is across the street—I went and took it up—she ran away once.

             . Last Saturday, a little Girl told me, a Man had run away with my Loin of Pork; a Butcher told me, he went through Clements-Inn


, so I followed him, and took it under his Arm; says I, You Villain, what do rob the Spital; he began to damn his Eyes in a sad Manner; when he was before the Justice, a Man said he belonged to a Gang; he was asked whether he was concerned in the Murder of the Man in Chelsea-Fields; he said he was not, but he supped with them the next Night that were.
- I was going through Clements-Inn, and hearing a Cry of Stop Thief, I saw this Fellow jump down all the Steps at once, I caught him fast in my Arms; then the Prosecutor came up and took him.




               Guilty 10 d.

My Mother lodged in Mr. Fuller's House, and so did the Prisoner; the Money was in a Box under my Mother's Bed, it was told in there on the Wednesday Night, and miss'd on the Friday following, and the Prisoner coming often to the House to see her Mother, was suspected, and being examined she confess'd and sign'd her Confession before the Justice, which was read in Court. The Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

WILLIAM JACKSON. I am shopman to Mr. Samuel Everingham: he is a hosier
, and lives in Oxford-street


. I was at his door about twenty-five minutes past ten o'clock in the morning of the 6th of December: I saw the prisoner looking at the things - I went behind the counter, and in a few minutes I saw something fall at the door; I ran out, and saw the prisoner in about a minute in Noel-street - he had an apron on with something in it; I brought him back to the shop, and called an officer, who opened his apron, and found these eleven pairs of stockings, which are my master's, and had been at the door.

            . On the 6th of December I was called, and took the prisoner in the shop; I found these eleven pairs of stockings in his apron - I took him to the watch-house, and asked what he meant to do with them; he said some boys in Regent-street said they would give him 6d. a pair, if he could get some.

            . I am watchman in Cavendish-square. After 11 at night, on the 7th of April, I stopped the prisoner with three pieces of timber, called Fir-quarter, about 5 feet long each: I took him to the watch-house: on the Monday morning he confessed he had sold a piece to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Hicks 
               



            ; we took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and Sir John granted a search warrant: we took the prisoner with us, and one of Sir John's constables: we searched, and found the piece of timber in 
               
                  Henry 
                  Hicks 
               



            's cellar: we desired him to take it up, and carry it to the place where he brought it from, which was Lloyd and Johnson's Meuse: he took it up, and carried it to Messrs. Lloyd and Johnson, in Marybone parish, called Queen Anne's street, to some new buildings, and said he brought it from that place. He said, the first he carried to Hicks, Hicks told him if he got any, to bring them to him, and he would give him as much as any body would for it; and not to come in at the shop door, but come round another way. The three pieces now lie at the watch-house, and nobody as yet has owned them.

            . I am clerk to Johnson and Lloyd. On the 9th of April, we took the prisoner at the bar before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            . He confirmed Woodman's account, with this addition, that he valued the piece of timber laid in the indictment at 3 s.
Prisoner's Defence.
I throw myself up to the mercy of God and the jury: I have nothing to say for myself. The first thing I carried to Hicks, were some chips, and he gave me 2 d. for them. I declare they were not worth one penny: he encouraged me to do it: I am a labourer

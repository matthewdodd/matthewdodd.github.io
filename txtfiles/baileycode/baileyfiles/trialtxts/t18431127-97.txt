 for stealing 9 cheroots, value 10d., the goods of 




Thomas Wilson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MATTHEW HESWELL
. I am in the service of Thomas Wilson, tobacconist, in Brook-street. On the 30th of Oct. I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, about a quarter to nine o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner come in, and, before I could get into the shop, he had the cigar-box lid off, and took these cigars out—I spoke to him—he made no reply, but knelt down and begged pardon, and said he would not do it again.





STEPHEN TAYLOR
 (police-constable S 11.) I went to the shop, and took the prisoner—I saw the cheroots under his feet—he was crying, and begged to be let off.





THOMAS DOWNING
 (police-constable E 47.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(ready)—the prisoner if the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 10.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Parkhurst.

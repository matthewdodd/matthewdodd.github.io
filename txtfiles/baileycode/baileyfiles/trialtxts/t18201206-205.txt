            . I live two doors from Solomons. On the 11th of December two boys passed my shop. I watched them - they went to Solomons' door, looked in at the window, stood about two minutes, and then one ran by my door very quick. I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the flannel; I went and told Solomons. I saw them lurking about the door the next day, told my husband, and he secured the prisoner - I am sure he is the person.

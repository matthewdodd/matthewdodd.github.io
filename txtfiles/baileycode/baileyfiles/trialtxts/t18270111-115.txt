            . I am a jeweller, and live in Old-street-road. On the 26th of December the prisoner came and offered a gold brooch for sale - he said his mother, who was in the country, had sent him to sell it - I asked where he lived - he said in Liquorpond-street, Lower-road, Islington - I told him to go home and send his father - he said he was at work; but he would send him when he came home - I kept the brooch. Taylor and an officer brought the prisoner to me, and asked if I had seen him before - I said Yes, and gave the brooch to the officer.

            . I lodge with the prisoner's father, in Catherine-street, Old-street-road


. On Christmas-day this brooch was in my room - I missed it next day, and spoke to the prisoner about it; he at first denied it, but at last said he had taken it, and took me to Fitch, where I found it.

             . The Prisoner came to my house when I was in bed, and asked for a washer-woman ; I directed her to one. This linnen was ready ironed , and lay upon the dresser , and she whipped them up, and took them away.
Q. Did you see her take these shirts?
Griffith . No, I was in bed; but a neighbour of mine saw her drop one of the neckcloths: They are the goods of Mr. Roberts, a presser
 in Coleman-Street


 .

            . Last Friday morning I saw the Prisoner drop a neckcloth, and called her to take it up, and then she took to her heels and run away . That made me suspect her to be a thief ; she was secured, and there was in her apron six shirts and three neckcloths, and one which she dropped, which Mrs. Griffith swore to before the Justice.

            , Mrs. Ball said that a woman had dropped something, that she had called to her, and she run away, and would not take it up: I run after her, and took her, and found six shirts and three neckcloths in her apron, and

RICHARD RICE
. I am an Excise-officer. In consequence of information on the 9th of Feb., I obtained a warrant, and on the 10th I went with it, with William and Thomas Hughes, M'Kay, Shakesby, and Frith, to No. 61, Princes-street, Lambeth, about a quarter after eleven o'clock in the morning—we knocked at the side-door twice—there was about a quarter of a minute between the two knocks—there are two doors, one in the street, and a side-door down an arch—the prisoner Brown opened the door—I asked for Mr. Jones, or Brown, or some fictitious name—he opened the door a few inches, saw me, and went to shut it again—we forced our way in—he left the door, and made his way towards the stairs—we secured him about half way up the first flight of stairs—he was taken down into the front parlour by myself and Thomas Hughes, and given into custody of a policeman—I then proceeded up stairs to the back room, first floor, and there saw a chair standing opposite the fire-place, with a board lying across it, and a fire-shovel with one end resting on the board, and the other between the bars of the grate—I saw some moulds with coin in them, and a great quantity of coins lying about—I put my hand on the moulds, and they were quite hot—there were two shillings in one mould, and one shilling in another—there was a pipkin on the fire, with white metal boiling in it, in a fluid state—I took it, and threw it on the floor—there was nobody in the room then besides me—some files and a knife were lying on the board, and two new metal spoons—some coins laid on the mantel-shelf—I saw about forty coins in the room altogether—I called Mr. Hughes into the room, and he took possession of all the articles.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You went on some information connected with the Excise I apprehend? A. Yes—the parties were working a private still—I went through every room in the house—there were three floors and seven rooms in it—I found two beds, one in the coining-room, and one in the back parlour—the other rooms had no furniture whatever—I found no female apparel about the first floor—I do not think there was any—Mr. Hughes was with me when I searched—I took possession of nothing besides these articles, which I considered suspicious—when I look Brown into custody he did not say he could not be bound by what his lodgers did, and did not know anything about it—I was not with him above a minute—he did not say in my presence that he had a female lodger who had people coming to visit her—I saw no one in the house besides these two—I first saw Tucker down in the

still room, in the custody of the police—that was below, in the kitchen, I think.





THOMAS HUGHES
. I am assistant to William Hughes, the supervisor of Excise. I accompanied the officers to this house on the day in question—I observed Brown open the door—I asked if Mr. Smith lived there—he attempted to shut the door, but I put my foot in, and it was forced in by Mr. Rice—when I got in, Brown made his escape towards the stairs—he got half-way up—I followed him, pulled him back, and, after a deal of difficulty, two or three of us got him into the front-parlour, and kept him in custody—he was in his shirt sleeves, which were tucked up—he asked for his coat, and said, "Do I know whether I came out of the still-room?" (meaning down stairs) "or from up stairs"—I told him, "From out of the still-room, (meaning down stairs)—he said he came down stairs, and not up stairs, I am sure of that—he was making his way up stairs when I went in—I went over the house after he was in charge of the police—I did not find anything—I did not observe any sign of paper-staining or paper-manufacturing—all the rooms were empty but the still-room, the coining-room, and the back kitchen—there were seven rooms-five were totally unfurnished—the still-room it on the ground floor, under the front parlour—that was one of the furnished rooms—the front parlour was furnished—that would make three rooms furnished, the front parlour, another room, and the coining-room—there was a bed and bedstead, a box or two, and a chair, in the coining-room; also, a bed in the back parlour, and one in the front parlour—there were but two beds in the house.

Cross-examined. Q. Had he his coat off when you took him? A. Yes it was in the front parlour—I believe I have told you all the conversation I had with him—he did not tell me he could not be answerable for what his lodgers did—I am the son of Mr. William Hughes—I am not in the Excise, I am employed by him—I found the still going on, a thriving trade apparently—Tucker was found down in the still-room—I first saw him there.





WILLIAM HUGHES
. I am a supervisor in the Excise. On the 10th of Feb. I accompanied the other witnesses to No. 61, Prince's-street—I guarded the front door, to see that no one came out, while the other parties made their entrance—I went in after them, and found Martin in custody of Rice and my son—they took him to the front parlour—I left him in custody of my son and the police, and proceeded after Rice, up stairs to the room, where I found the implements of coining—these are the articles, which I produce—this silver watch was lying in the centre, with two heaps of base coin, on the mantel-piece—the moulds were quite hot—I could not hold them in my hand at first—there were two impressions in one mould, and one in another—I produce a file, a knife, and a pipkin—when I left the room up stairs, I proceeded down stairs the under-ground kitchen or cellar, where I found Tucker, and the private still going on—I there found a quantity of spirits—I examined some ashes that were lying in the still-room, and found one of the base shillings unfinished, which I produce—this shilling was not kept apart from the others—they were all put together—it was rough in the edges—I also found some pieces of cuttings, or parings of metal, lying in the ashes—I did not take any notice of them—I left them there—they had a bright appearance, as if not long cut off—they had been melted—they had been pared off the shillings, I have no doubt—I asked Tucker how long he had been in the house—he said between three and four months—I asked him if the man Martin had been there the same time he had—he said they both came together—I then asked if he knew any thing about the coining going on up stairs—he said no, the business was carried on up stairs by the other man, Martin, and he did not know what he was doing there—I said it was impossible for the business to be carried on

up stairs without his knowledge—he said he did not know what he was doing—I then asked him if they were not partners—he replied, they were—I asked him about the shilling I found in the ashes—he seemed rather confused at the first moment, and stated after, they might be brought down in the ashes, a Martin used to bring his ashes down into that room—I do not believe he saw me rake it out—the front parlour had a few chairs in it, and a table—I found some papers in a cupboard, such as receipts for hats, which I did not remove—I also produce a receipt from the landlord, which I found in an ornament on the mantel-piece, in the front parlour—I went over the house—I did not see any thing of paper-staining or hanging going on—not the least—there was one bed in the coining-room, and there were two or three beds on one bedstead in the room below—the distance between the still-room and the coining-room is perhaps about ten yards.

Cross-examined. Q. I suppose your cross-examination of Mr. Tucker took some time? A. Not a very little time—I might be five minutes in the questions I put to him—I have been in the Excise upwards of twenty-seven years—I did not arrange this conversation when anybody else was present—there were parties in the room—I cannot charge my memory, at the present time, who the parties were that were present—I am sure there were parties present, because they had not left the still-room—Tucker was with me in the still-room, the police, and also my brother officers—I cannot charge my memory with their names—they could not be very far off—the room was not three yards across—I cannot say whether my son or Rice was present, or the other witnesses—Martin was taken down out of the parlour into the still-room—I do not know whether he was present—it might be before he was taken down—I think there were persons in the room at the time—those were the words that I put to Tucker—I have told all that was said—I never heard a word about a female being up stain before this time from anybody—my information was connected with the private still and something else—I did not know where to find the still till I got to the house—I first went into a lobby which leads to the staircase—the first room I went into was the room up stairs, where the coining was going on—that was the first place I went to, after Brown was brought down stairs into the front parlour—I assisted in getting him into the parlour, and I bolted up stairs a quick as I could possibly go, leaving him with my son and the police—I think there was a gown, or something of that sort, which Tucker said belonged to his daughter—there was a little piece of very inferior linen, in a chest in Tucker's room) in the back kitchen, where the bed was, adjoining the still-room, going down to it.





JOHN CHARLES KAY
. I was one of the Excise officers that went to the house—I remained outside for some time, to see that nobody escaped—when I went in 1 found the prisoner Brown in custody of Thomas Hughes, and the policeman, just coming off the stairs as I entered the house—I assisted Thomas Hughes in securing him—he became very restless—I told him to be quiet—we took him into the parlour, and got his coat—I left him for a moment, and ran up stairs, where the coining had been going on—I just cast my eye round on the things, but did not touch anything—Thomas Hughes called me down stairs, as Brown was very restless—I assisted in taking him down into the still-room, where I found Tucker—Thomas Hughes and one of the policemen was there—William Hughes came down then to me—I continued there for some time—I heard William Hughes say he had picked up a shilling while I was in the still-room—he was raking about the ashes at the time—Brown was there, at the time Hughes said he had found it—I did not hear the coversation between William Hughes and Tucker—I heard him talking to him—I did not direct my attention to what was passing—my attention was chiefly

called to looking after the still, seeing there was no accident happened with that—I left my brother officers to attend to that.





THOMAS SHAKESBY
 (police-constable L 114.) I went to this house—Brown was given into my custody—I took him to the station, and then returned to the house—I went up stairs to the front room first floor, and found these things by the fire-place—I found this plaster of Paris at the right-hand side of the fire-place, in this state, in this box—I produce a tin band which was by the side of it, and a file, which I found in a box at the side—I afterwards went down stairs to the still-room, and found this crucible by the side of the still, and this iron spoon, in the back-kitchen, which is very near the still-room, it goes down the steps into the cellar—it is under ground, and this was the kitchen, just four or five steps above—I found some more plaster of Paris in a paper, in the coining-room—I did not make a minute search before I took Brown to the station—I left the Excise officers in possession of the premises.





EDMUND FRITH
 (police-constable L 122.) On the 16th of February I received a small paper box, containing cuttings from William Guest.





RICHARD GLOAG
 (police-constable L 113.) On the 10th of Feb. I went to the house in Prince's-street—the four excisemen were there—I remained till ten o'elock at night, Etheridge then relieved me.





JOHN ETHERIDGE
 (police-constable L 35.) On the 10th of Feb. I went to this house—I staid from nine o'clock at night till Saturday morning—Tawerden then relieved me.





ALEXANDER TAHERDIN
 (police-constable L 57.) Early in the morning of Saturday, the 11th of Feb., I went to this house—I staid there three hours—Shaw relieved me—on the Monday following I went again—Shaw was there then—I went into the back-kitchen—seeing Shaw raking over the cinders, I took a stick, and picked up several pieces of metal, which I put into a box, which I returned to Shaw—I left him there.





JOHN INGS
 (police-constable L 22.) On Saturday, the 11th of Feb., I went to this house—I relieved Thomas Shaw—I staid from nine till six o'clock the following morning—Shaw returned to relieve me—I went again on Sunday evening at nine, and staid till six the following morning—Shaw then relieved me.





THOMAS SHAW
 (police-constable L 30.) On Saturday morning, the 11th of Feb., about nine o'clock, I went to this house, and staid till nine at night—Ings relieved me—I went there again at six the following morning, Sunday—I relieved Ings, and remained there till I was relieved by Ings again—I went there again on Monday morning—I then understood that coining had been going on—that induced me to search—I went into the back-kitchen, and searched the fire-place—I found a quantity of metal cuttings—Taberdin came in afterwards, while I was raking among the ashes—I took a little box off the mantel-piece, put the cuttings into it, and kept it in my possession till the following Wednesday, the 15th—I took it to the superintendent's office and gave it to Sergeant Brown.





WILLIAM BROWN
 (police-sergeant L 9.) On the 15th of Feb. Shaw gave me this card box—I was sent for to the office, I gave it to him again—I do not know what became of it afterwards—this is it.

COURT. Q. Why could you not have kept it? A. I did not know anything of the case at the time.





THOMAS SHAW
 (re-examined). After Brown returned it to me I gave it to him again. Lupton took it, and afterwards I saw it in his possession.





HENRY LUPTON
 (police-sergeant L 7.) I received this box and gave it to Guest. I did not keep it, because I was ordered to go into West-square.






WILLIAM GUEST
 (police-constable L 62.) I received this box from Lupton and gave it to Frith.





JAMES RANDALL NASH
. I am a barge builder. I am the owner of the house, 61, Prince's-street—about the first of Oct. the prisoner Brown called at my counting-house, with a friend, for the purpose of renting this house—I enquired what trade or business he intended to carry on in the premises—he told me a paper stainer—I let him the house; he was to pay 24l.—this receipt has my signature—I received the money from Brown on the lst or 2nd of Jan.

Cross-examined. Q. You went to receive the rent on one occasion, I believe? A. Yes, I saw a young woman there, and left a message with her for Brown.

MR. DOANE. Q. In consequence of that did you receive the money for your rent? A. Yes, it was paid by Brown himself.





MR. JOHN FIELD
. I am inspector of coin to the Mint. This platterd of Paris mould is intended for casting two counterfeit shillings at one time—it has the impression of both sides of a shilling on it—it is in a condition to work—here are two counterfeit shillings which appear to have been cast in it—these appear in the state in which they first came out of the mould, with the get attached—the plaster of Paris and these moulds are of the same kind of material—this is another mould for casting shillings—it has a shilling cast in it—it has never been removed till this moment—this tin band is for the purpose of forming the mould—it appears to have been so used—there is plaster of Paris now in it—here are twenty-eight counterfeit shillings which appear to have been cast in the mould which now has the shilling in it—there is white metal in this pipkin, of a similar description to the counterfeit coin—it appears to have been in a fused state—these white metal spoons are corresponding metal to that in the pipkin and the counterfeit coin—they are known as Britannia metal—the crucible appears to have been used for the purpose of fluxing metal—it has a portion of metal of a similar description in it now—the files would be used for the purpose of removing any superfluous metal from the edge of the coin after first cast—they appear to have white metal in the teeth—here are some more clippings of white metal of a similar description—they appear to have been taken from the edges of the counterfeit coin after first cast—such particles would attach to the coin cast in these moulds, and must be removed by scissors, a knife, or file—these appear to be of that description—here is a knife and files—there appears to be every thing necessary for coining—here are also five shillings cast in the double mould—they are different from the twenty-eight.

MR. BALLANTINE
called






JAMES ALLEN
. I have known the prisoner Brown two months. I know the house he lived in, No. 61—I have brought coke to the house and shot it in the bottom room, by Mr. Brown's orders—I have brought a bushel and half a hundred weight of coke up stairs, as far as the front door, and shot it in the cupboard on the left of the party that lived up stairs, by order of the party that lived in the room—she was a tall genteel woman dressed in black—I have seen her standing at the door—she lived in the room—she was standing there when I brought the coke and coal, and showed me the cupboard where to shoot it—on the Sunday after that I served her with a bundle of greens—I never was in the room in my life—I saw her at that time—she paid me for the things—I cannot tell how often I have been in the house; as often as they ordered me to bring things—I have not seen this woman in the lower room—I never saw Brown in the upper room.

Tucker's Defence. I worked the still since I went into the house, but I do

not know any thing about any thing else, not the least; all the ashes and other things were sent down to me in the cellar, and I took no notice of what is was.





WILLIAM HUGHES

re-examined. There were two doors to this house, a side door, and a door to the street; no other—I was guarding the front door and a window very near it, that no person might make their escape—Kay was standing at the side door—we were so stationed round the house that no one could escape—the windows were all fast down with the catch and not disturbed—I examined every part of the house, and am sure no one could have escaped without our notice.

J. C. KAY
re-examined. I was stationed at the side door and window—it was impossible that any one could have escaped without my perceiving it—the other witness was at the front door—there is no other door, no back door—the back of the house butted on other premises.

Brown. There are two sliding windows to the top room, from which any body could escape; Tucker told Hughes that a woman went out three minutes before they came in, and they were not round the place then; I took the house, intending to work the still with Tucker as partner, and the upper part of the house was occupied by other people.

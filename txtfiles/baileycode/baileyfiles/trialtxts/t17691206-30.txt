            . On the 13th of November I lost the things, laid in the indictment, out of my house (mentioning them by name) I found the prisoner with the coat and waistcoat, and hat on him, two days after. He knew they were my property; he worked for me, I am a taylor; he made them for a customer; he had pawned the burdett.
Prisoner's Defence.
I can't say nothing for myself.

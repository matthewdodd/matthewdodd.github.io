THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant D 4.) On the evening of the 26th January, about half-past six o'clock, I met the prisoner in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, with a bundle—I asked what he had got—he said a jacket, and that he got it from Charles-street—I asked where—he said he would show me—I went with him—he showed me a dead wall, where he said he had picked it up—I opened the bundle, and found a tablecover, a red shawl, and a jacket in it—they were wet—there wet—there was a pin in the shawl—on our way to the station-house, he told me two boys saw him pick them up—I asked him if those two boys would he down at the office he said he did not know, but they would be fools if they were.






JANE ELIZABETH OLDAKER
. I am the wife of Thomas Oldaker, a butcher, in Homer-street, New-road. This jacket, table-cover and shawl are our property—I hung them in the garden about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, on the pales, in front of the house—the line was cut, and all the linen fell down—I took them all in but these things, which were on the pales, and I missed them that night—I do not know the prisoner—they were quite wet at the station-house—they hung on the inner paling—there is an outer railing round the house—he must have got over the wall of the next house, which is a good height.

Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday nigh, I was walking up Charles-street, and against the dead wall, I saw these things—a man came, by and kicked it—two boys were there—I picked them up.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years to the Prison Ship.

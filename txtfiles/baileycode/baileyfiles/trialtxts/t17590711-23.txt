            . I was in the house drinking when Mrs Lang missed the silver mug. The prisoner was going out; she asked where it was; he said, he gave it to the maid. Mr Lang was coming in at the same time, and bid me stop the prisoner 'till the maid came in. I searched him, and found it between his legs, (produc'd in court) and depos'd to by the prosecutor.

I was drunk and foolish when I did it.

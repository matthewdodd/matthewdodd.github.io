JOHN REID
. I am a sailor in the coal-trade. I was in company with the prisoners and another woman at Deptford on the 23rd of November—I was rather the worse for liquor—I had a leather bag in my left hand trowsers' pocket, which had in it the money stated—I missed it in the street, and charged the prisoners with having robbed me—I had been

drinking with them just before at a public-house—this is my bag, which I lost—I had a handkerchief also taken out of my pocket.





JOHN EVANS
 (police-constable R 190.) I was on duty in High-street, Deptford—I was passing the end of Dowling-street—I heard a number of persons talking—I listened, and went down—I saw the prosecutor holding Mary Smith by the hand—he said she had robbed him of a bag with 15s. in it—I took her—she got from me and ran, but I caught her—she got one of her hands from me, took something from her bosom, and dropped it—I sent for a candle, and picked up this purse with 15s. in it—I found this handkerchief on her at the station-house—there was nothing found on Mary Ann Smith—the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what he was about.





CHRISTOPHER CHAPPELL
. I saw the prisoners and another woman with the prosecutor—he accused one of them of robbing him—the other woman advised the prisoners to give it up, and one of them, I do not know which, said she would go to the light, and see what was in it—the other woman got away.

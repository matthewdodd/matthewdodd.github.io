            . I was in Fenchurch-street


 last Saturday night, a little after nine o'clock, two men came by me; a gentleman called to me, and said, Capt.
 Hammet, a fellow has picked your pocket; I felt, and found my handkerchief was gone; he said, this fellow has got it, meaning the prisoner; he shewed it me; there was another person with the prisoner, he made off.

            . On Saturday night last I passed Captain 
               
                  Hammet
               


            , I saw the two lads behind him; I turned round, and saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of his pocket, and was going to convey it to the other; he seing me observe him, threw it against the wall; I took it up, and called to the captain; I held the prisoner by the collar; the captain owned the handkerchief.
Prisoner's defence.
I never was nigh the gentleman; I am as innocent as the child unborn.

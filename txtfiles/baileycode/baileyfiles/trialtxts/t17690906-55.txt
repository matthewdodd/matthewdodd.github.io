            . On Monday the 10th of July, a little after eleven o'clock at night, I was going up Fleet-street


, when I felt something at my pocket. I turned round and saw the boy at the bar with my handkerchief. He ran away with it, and I after him. Just before I overtook him he dropt it. I took hold of him, and picked up my handkerchief. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw two boys throw it down, and I picked it up, when the gentleman ran after me, and said it was his. I said, Take it.
Prosecutor. There were three boys with him, and a young fellow about twenty-four years of age.

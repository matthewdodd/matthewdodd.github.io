                  John 
                  Waring 
               



            . I am a plumber
 in Aldgate High-street, I lost four shirts, four sheets, and two table cloths.
Q. What is the value of them all?
Waring. They may be worth about twenty shillings or better. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Allen 
               



             was my servant. I charged her with taking them. She said they were gone to have some iron moulds taken out, having had an accident with them, as she pretended; after that she own'd she gave them to 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Nesbit

                  Sarah 
                  Burton 
               



            , the other prisoner. We took up Burton, who own'd she received them of Allen, that she knew them to be my things, and said they were brought to her apartment in New-Gravel-lane, Shadwell, and she had sent another person to pawn them, and they were pawned in her own name.
Q. Did you find them again?
Waring. I was with the constable when they were found at Mrs. Achinghead's, in Ratcliff Highway, where she directed me to go for them.
Q. Where are the goods?
Waring. They are in the hands of the constables 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Town 
               



             and 
               
                  John 
                  Hunt 
               



            , and they are not here.
Q. How did Burton say she knew them to be your's?
Waring. She had lived servant with my father some years, and she knew them to be mine.

                  Collier 
               



            . I lodge at Mr. Waring's; I lost three shirts, a pair of white silk stockings, and sundry other things belonging to my mother and my aunt.

Q. What things belong'd to your mother?
Collier. A cotton gown, value 5 s. a muslin apron, and a pair of hose.
Q. What of your aunt's did you lose?
Collier. A capuchine. Her name is 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Jackson

                  Mary 
                  Allen 
               



             confessed before my Lord mayor and alderman Blachford that these things were taken out of the house by 
               
                  John 
                  Jones 
               



            , otherwise English, who carried some of them to pawn; the capuchine and several other things were found in her custody, that and a pair of white stockings were found in her drawer. Produced in court.

                  Mary

            . She confessed it, and brought some of the things, thinking her master would make it up with her. She confessed she had been robbing him for some time, and said she was very sorry for what she had done.
Q. What things did she bring you?
Motlow. Two shirts, a sheet and a blanket, which are not in the indictment. I found these two tablecloths in her custody. Produced in court, and deposed to by 
               
                  John 
                  Waring

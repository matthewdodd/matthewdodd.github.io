            . I am a watchman of Wellclose-square. On Sunday morning, the 10th of June, about  half-past five o'clock, I met the prisoner in Church-lane, St. George's in the East, and stopped him, with a bag of tools on his shoulder; he said he was going to Bury's, a dealer in marine-stores, and that he had brought them from a person at Stepney - we found it contained eight chisels and six planes - he was three or four hundred yards from Hogg's premises.

JOSEPH HOGG. I am a plane-maker

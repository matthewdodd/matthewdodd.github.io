            : I keep a haberdasher's shop

 in Cheapside


; I am a sole and separate dealer; my servant informed me the prisoner had taken a piece of ribbon; he stopped her as she was going away. I sent for a constable; she was searched, and six pieces were found upon him, and one piece she produced before the constable came. It is hardly possible to swear to the ribbons because we do not mark them; I believe them to be mine; she went down on her knees, and said she never did so before, or never would again; I thought that an acknowledgement of it.

            . I am porter to Mrs. Smith; the prisoner came in and asked for some ribbons; while she was looking over the ribbons I saw her put a piece into her pocket; I called my mistress, and one of the gentlewomen told her of it. I stopped the prisoner and went for a constable, and he said it was proper for the maid to search her.

            . When the constable came I was ordered to go up stairs and see her searched; when she was undressed, six pieces of ribbon were taken out of her pocket; I remember seeing one of the pieces particularly that day in the box.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing about it; when they took my pockets off first, there was nothing in them; afterwards they said the ribbons were in them.

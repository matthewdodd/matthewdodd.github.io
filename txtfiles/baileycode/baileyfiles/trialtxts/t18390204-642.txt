JOHN KNIGHT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
21st of January, I truss of hay, value 3s., the goods of 



Thomas Jennings; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS JENNINGS
. I keep the Windsor Castle, in King-street, Hammersmith. The prisoner was horse-keeper to a widow, who runs omnibusses out of my yard—he had no access to my hay—he must pick a lock to get at it—a truss of hay was taken from my loft on the 21st of January, the lock of which had been picked and locked again—in consequence of information I got a policeman who took him, and in going along he confessed he had taken a truss of hay and sold it to Smith next door but one to me, for 2s.—we went and found it in Smith's stable, where the prisoner said if was—it was my hay, and I had missed it.





JESSE PICKTON
. I am journeyman to Mr. Dobson, a baker, at Hammersmith. I saw the prisoner bring the truss of hay out of the prosecutor's, and take it to Smith's and leave it there, about six o'clock in the evening on the 21st of January.





HENRY BEAVEN
 (police-sergeant T 3.) I took the prisoner—I went to Mr. Smith's and found the hay, which the prosecutor claimed—the prisoner said he sold it there for 2s.—it was a truss of good meadow hay.

Prisoner's Defence. He never asked me a word about it, but took me to the farrier's shop and said, "You know all about it, come along with me."





JAMES STEEL
 (police-constable T 140.) I produce a certificate of the

prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read)—I was at the the prisoner is the man.

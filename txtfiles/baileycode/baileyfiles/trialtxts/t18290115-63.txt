            . The prisoner was in my employ, and had the care of a shop for me, and used to receive money, which he should enter in this book; there is no entry of 14s. on the 17th of December.

             requested me to go to the shop, and purchase two dozen collars, a pair of spurs, and a bit of sponge; the prisoner made this bill for them, but did not put a receipt to it - "I pair of spurs, 8s.; 2 dogs' collars, 4s.; sponge, 2s.," making 14s., which I paid him.

            . This is my property - they ought to have been sold for about that price; it was the prisoner's duty to have entered them in this book, which he has not; I went in about an hour after Mr. Clarke had left, and asked him if any one had been there to buy any thing; he said there had not.
Prisoner's Defence. I found I sold the collars too cheap, for a gentleman came into the shop, and asked the price of one, and I told him half-a-crown; he would not give that, he went to the other shop, and the boy came to me for some: I asked him what they sold them for: he said 4s.; I then found I sold them too cheap, and I meant to keep the money back till Saturday to make it right.

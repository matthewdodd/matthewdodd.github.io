            . I am shopman to James Withenberry Hawthorn, a linen-draper
, of Islington


. On the 30th of August the prisoner came into the shop with another person - the prisoner had a basket; she asked to see some bonnet ribbons - I showed them different things; they bought one yard of gauze ribbon at 21/2d., and said they would call again on Saturday - they then bought a pair of stockings at 71/2d.; before they left the counter I saw a piece of ribbon in the basket, which they had not bought- the prisoner went out alone; I followed, tapped her on the shoulder at the next house, and brought her back - when she got back the ribbon was not in the basket, but Davis produced it; it was taken out of a drawer on the counter.

            . I am a labourer
, and live in St. Giles'


. On Sunday morning, the 5th of July, I had four half-crowns and one shilling in my pocket - I was going to chapel, and was going to give my money to Mrs. Fox to take care of for fear I should be robbed; the prisoner came and snatched it out of my hand, and put it into her bosom - she was quite a stranger; I took hold of her - there was a mob; I called out and she was taken - I lost my money.
Prisoner. He struck me in a broker's-shop before that. Witness. No, I did not.

            . I was going by between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and saw a great many people; the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner - he said he had been robbed, but I was afraid to interfere, there were so many thieves about; I told him not to let her go; I got another watchman - I saw the prisoner take some half-crowns from her bosom, and give them to a dustman.

            . I am an officer. I was called; I saw about forty thieves there and some girls of the town; I did not see the dustman, he was gone; the prisoner owned to me that she had the money.

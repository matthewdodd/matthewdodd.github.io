             sworn.
I am a dealer in horses
. On the 26th of December last, I lost five saddles, and six bridles; they were in the window, the frame of which was taken out.


                  DAVID
                   WATSON
               



             sworn.
I am a saddler. These three saddles were offered me for sale; one was my own make, I knew. They were offered by King, the prisoner. I do not know the other. Six bridles were offered with the saddles. I told Lovell, the baker, for whom I had made one of the saddles. I informed Justice Wilmot, and obtained an order to search a place in Plow-yard. I was afterwards informed by another man, such articles were there to be sold, and King was in the room then, and offered them for sale. I went afterwards with one Mr. Green, to whom a part of the property belonged, and who had got a search-warrant; and we found part of the property which is now in court, at this apartment. The things have never been out of my possession. I do not know how they came there.

                   HARLOW
               



             sworn.
The prisoner, Lamb's brother, came and took this little tenement of me. I have been there several times, and seen the prisoner there with his brother. I took the prisoner, Lamb, at a publick-house. I could not find his brother. Nothing was said to him; but he begged he might not be sent to goal, and he would tell where the things were; only a part were found; he said they were at a fence in Wentworth-street, but did not know the house;
(Produced. That part deposed to by Watson, which was found in Plow-yard; and 
               
                  James
                   Green
               



             particularly deposed to an old bridle which King offered for sale, but which was of little or no value.)and several of the other things were deposed to by Green.
PRISONER LAMB's DEFENCE.
I told what I knew of the saddles, on Mr. Green's promise that I should not go to goal. The place was not mine. I did not take the saddles; I saw them there, and asked my brother what they did there, and he said it was no business of mine.
PRISONER KING's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of it.
The prisoner, Lamb, called one witness, who gave him a good character.

               GUILTY

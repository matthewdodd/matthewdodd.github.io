JOHN ROBERTS
 was indicted

 for stealing on the 
9th of November, 1 handkerchief, value, 2s., the goods of 



Thomas Barbour, from his person.






WILLIAM CHILD
. I am an officer of the Tower-ward. On the afternoon of the 9th of November, I was in King-street, near Guildhall—I saw the prisoner with another—they went from Guildhall towards Cheap-side, following two gentlemen—they crossed from the top of King-street to go up Cheapside—there was a very great crowd there—Mr. Barbour had got in among the crowd—they followed him close up—the prisoner got in amongst the crowd close to Mr. Barbour, he got the handkerchief out of his pocket, and was putting it behind him, as if to give it to somebody, when I took it from his hand, having got in between him and his companion—I collared him and took him to Guildhall, but found nothing but a common handkerchief on him.

Prisoner. If I was common pickpocket, is it likely I should put the handkerchief into his hand—the gentleman had his handkerchief out part of the way, this man caught hold of me and snatched the handkerchief out of the pocket himself. Witness. I did not pick the gentleman's pocket—it was not hanging out at all till the prisoner pulled it out.





THOMAS BARBOUR
. I live in Cavendish-square. This is my handkerchief—it was in my pocket on the 9th of November—I am not aware that it hung out at all—I know it was safe not five minutes before.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of May, 1 hat, value 15s.; 1 pair of gloves, value 4s. 6d.; and 1 handkerchief, value 3s.; the goods of 



William Jones.






WILLIAM JONES
. On the 23rd of May I was at the Castle public-house, in Whitechapel—I hung up my hat, which had a pair of gloves and a handkerchief in it—when I came to look for them, they were gone, and an old hat left in the place of mine—I lost my hat altogether—I did not observe the prisoner there.





JOHN TAPSCOTT
. I keep the Castle public-house. On the 23rd of May I was sitting drinking a glass of grog with a friend—the prisoner came in, and called for a glass of ale—I served him—he then went out backwards, and returned—before he went he hung up his hat—when he came back he took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's hat, and wiped bis face with it—he then doubled up the handkerchief, put it on his forehead, put the hat on, and went out—I looked up soon after, and saw an old hat in the room of it—I am certain he is the person—the prosecutor went out, but could not find him.

Prisoner. I never was in the house in my life.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             had lived a servant

 with me a fortnight; on friday morning, the 28th. of September, she went out about 6 in the morning; my brother went down and found the door open, and no body there; he came and told me as I lay in bed; I got up, and she was not to be found; I suspected something might be lost; I looked about, and miss'd a silver spoon, also a child's cotton gown, not quite finish'd; a child's colour'd frock, a short red cloak of my wife's, 12 yards of flaxen cloth, a straw hat, a cotton gown of my wife's an apron, a black calamanco quilted petticoat; I went about in the neighbourhood, thinking she might have pawn'd them. After I was come back, John Rawlings came and ask'd me my name, I told him; he said, Was not you robb'd over night? I said, I had been this morning; he ask'd me what things I had lost, I mentioned some of them; he said, he had the girl and things at his house; I went with him, and found some of the things and

            , who directly own'd she had taken them away that morning. I cannot swear any thing against the other person, only Mary James said, she gave her some of the things, which she carried to pawn.

                  James 
               



             brought me this spoon; she told me she was servant to one Mr. Leach; I said, I must send to him, to know if he had knowledge of it; she immediately confess'd he knew nothing of it; and that she got up to go to fist the cinders in the street, and took the opportunity to take the things away; She had a bundle in her lap, which were the other things; the cloak she had on; she gave me 4 s. 6 d. which she said she had of another woman, who had pawn'd the gown and coat. The other prisoner was at the door, but I know nothing of her being concern'd, any further than what

             brought the gown and petticoat to me, and told me they were her own; I lent her 9 s. upon them. I had known her some time, by her using my shop. I did not see the other prisoner.

            's Defence. I got up in the morning, and was going to wash; I had sifted my cinders. This other prisoner came to me, she us'd to desire me to bring things away from my master's several times; she said, if I would take some things away, she would pawn them; she look'd on the silver spoon, and said, there was no mark on it, and it would do very well to sell to a silversmith; she brought but 8 s. for the gown and petticoat, and demanded half a crown of me, and 9 pence for carrying the things; and a shilling for her breakfast.

            . I am a carpenter
, and live with my father, at Tottenham-high cross


; the prisoner worked for my father four days, and left him about a fortnight ago. Last Tuesday morning, about five o'clock, I found my chest broke open, which I locked over night, and all the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name) were missing.
Q. How did the person get to your chest?
Hunt. One of the windows that was screwed over night, was down in the morning. I and another person came in pursuit to London, but suspected another person: we found the prisoner with the tools, at the White Hart, in Shoreditch. When we were going to the watch-house with him, he said he was sorry for what he had done, and desired me to be as favourable as I could.
Mr. Hodge, that went with the prosecutor in the pursuit, confirmed the account he had given.
Prisoner's Defence.
The man that took the tools out of the shop, delivered them to me, and he went to Hackney, and was to meet me afterwards.

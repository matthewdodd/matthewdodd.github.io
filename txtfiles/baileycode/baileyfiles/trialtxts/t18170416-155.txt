            . I live in Bread-street, Cheapside. On the 1st of March, I was in Holborn, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; when I came to Broad-street, St. Giles's


, there was a crowd - I was passing through it; just before I got to Queen-street, I felt something touch my pocket, and I missed my handkerchief. The prisoner turned round, and asked me if I had lost any thing, and the officer secured him.

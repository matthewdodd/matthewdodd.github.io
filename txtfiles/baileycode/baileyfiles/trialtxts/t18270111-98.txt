            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Broadwood, piano-forte-makers
. On the 9th of December I was out with their van, and left my coat on the box, while I went into the Barley-mow public-house, Dorset-street; I received information, came out, and it was gone - I have not found it.

            . I am a butcher. I was in Dorset-street, and saw this van at the Barley-mow. The prisoner and another stood on the opposite side; I saw them come over, and the other man took the coat off the box; I had seen them talking together - the other ran off, down the mews, and the prisoner after him - he had seen him take it; he came over to me, and told me not to say any thing about it - I knew him before.

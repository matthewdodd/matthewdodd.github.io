             sworn.
I lost a linen handkerchief the 21st of August, value one shilling, just on this side Temple Bar


, I was coming through the Bar a little after six, and I thought I felt something at my pocket, I immediately put my hand into my pocket and found I had lost my handkerchief, I turned round and saw the prisoner go across the way, and I stopped some little time doubting whether he had it or not, for I did not see it in his possession then, and a gentleman who followed me, and saw him do it, immediately stopped him: The prisoner dropped the handkerchief, and I went immediately and picked it up, there was a coach passing at the time, which prevented me taking it up directly.
- MARTIN sworn.
I was going through Temple Bar, and Mr. Speed was coming towards Fleet-street, and I saw the prisoner with his right hand take Mr. Speed's handkerchief out of his pocket, and he crossed from the pavement, and I caught hold of his coat, and a coach was going past, and he almost got under the wheel: I brought him back, and he dropped the handkerchief immediately, Mr. Speed took up the handkerchief, which the prisoner dropped, for he had no pocket: The prisoner was taken into a shop.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

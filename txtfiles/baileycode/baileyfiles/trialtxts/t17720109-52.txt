. The prisoner was charged with the things in the indictment, and she acknowledged she had pawned them. She was my servant
 four months; we had a pretty good character with her. She frankly acknowledged she had pawned them, where she pawned them, and what she had on them.
Q. Did you make any promise not to prosecute her?
Tomkins. No, I did not; I charged the officer with her, and she was committed.

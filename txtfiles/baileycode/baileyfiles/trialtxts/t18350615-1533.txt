PATRICK MURRAY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
4th of Jane, 1 half-crown and 1 shilling, the monies of 



Moses Wells, from the person 



John Wells.






JOHN WELLS
. I am the son of Moses Wells. My father sent me on an errand; he gave me half-a-crown and a shilling to take to the brushmaker's—as I was going I met the prisoner—I did not know him—he was standing still, with a donkey and a cart—he asked me to feed the donkey, and to get up into the cart—before I got into the cart I counted over my money, and put it into my pocket—I then got into the cart, and then he got up into the cart after me—he said, "What have you got there?"—I said, "What is that to you?"—he then forced my hand out of my pocket, and forced his hand into it, took my money out, and ran away as fast as he could—I called out," Police "as loud as I could—the policeman came, and he was taken soon afterwards—the man was in the public-house who belonged to the cart.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known the prisoner before? A. I never saw him before—the man who was in the public-house knew that he was minding the cart.





MOSES WELLS
. I am the witness's father. I live by carding horse-hair—I intrusted him to go with the money for one dozen of soft waste, at 3d. a pound, to Goswell-road.





EDWARD CUMMINGS
. I sell fish. On the 4th of June, I left the prisoner to mind my cart while I was with my master for two hours—I then came out—I saw this child crying—he said, "That boy has robbed me of 3s. 6d. "—the policeman asked me his name—I told him, and where he lived—I went with him to the place, and took the prisoner—he threw the 3s. 6d. to his brother, who ran off with it.





WILLIAM GARROD
 (police-constable G 169.) I took the prisoner in charge. (The prisoner received a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

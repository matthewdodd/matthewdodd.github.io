            . As I was going down Tottenham court-road on the 29th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning; I was followed by the prisoner and by another person; I wanted to get rid of them; I went into a public house; they followed me into the house; they sat down on each side of me; I had twelve shillings and upwards in my pocket; I am certain I had it safe when I went into the house, for I had bought some cheese just before and had looked at my money; the prisoner sat on that side of me where my pocket was; I found his hand in my pocket; I had him taken up; he then confessed he had stole my money, that he had bought a handkerchief with part of it, and that the other man had the rest.

             the Headborough deposed to the prisoner's confession.
The prisoner in his defence said he knew nothing of the money.

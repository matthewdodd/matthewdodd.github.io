            . I saw the two prisoners standing by a pint pewter pot, which stood on Mr. Tisciker's green stall, in the Fleet Market


; I saw her put her gown over the pot, and then she took it away; I told Mr. Tisciker of it; he followed her, and brought her back with the pot upon her.
The pot produced and deposed to by Henry Green.

I intended to carry the pot home; before I could read the name upon it they stopt me.

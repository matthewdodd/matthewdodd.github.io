                  BREMLIDGE
               



            . I am clerk of the judgments in the Court of Common Pleas, and have a copy of the record of an action, T. C. Shields and H. J. Johns, plaintiffs, and 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Russell
               



            , defendant.

                  WATTS
               



            . I am cryer to Lord Chief Justice Dallas. I remember this case being tried, and administering the oath to the defendant. I heard him examined as witness for the plaintiffs.
MR. 
               
                  WILLIAM 
                  B. GURNEY
               



            , I am a short-hand writer. I attended and took notes on the trial of this cause, and have an examined copy of the defendant's evidence. I examined it word for word.
Q. Just turn to where he speaks of the delivery of the parcel - A. He was asked whether he had a parcel to carry to Russell's warehouse - he said he had three to carry out that day, the 1st of December, 1820; that he received the parcel in question from Mr. West, Sir J. Perring's clerk - that he went to the Swan-with-two-Necks, and delivered the two others, and then went to Russell's office, with the third, the one in question, and got there not much after seven o'clock in the evening - that the first person he saw there was a working man, who loads the waggon, he desired to be served first - laid down the parcel, and came away - and was certain that the parcel he received from West was the same he delivered. He was asked, on cross examination,
"Do you know a person named Nightingale - A. Yes, my Lord. Q. Is he a man with one arm - A. Yes. Q. And very red whiskers - A. Yes." He could not exactly say how long he had known him, not to be intimate with him - he first saw him about three years ago. He is then asked. Q.
"He did not go to the waggon-office with you - A. No. Q. I mean at the time the parcel was delivered by you at Russell's office, was or was not Nightingale there - A. No." Nightingale was then called forward close to the witness, and he was asked,
"Is that Nightingale - A. Yes. Q. Was he or not with you on the 1st of December, when you went to the office - A. He was not. Q. I understand you to swear positively, that he was not at Russell's waggon-office with you - A. He was not." He stated that Nightingale was in the habit of occasionally visiting him at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            's, and taking tea with him. He was asked by Sergeant 
               Pell
            , on cross examination,
"Q. You did not observe anybody in the office -A. No. Q. If there had been you must have seen them - A. Yes." He said he observed nobody but the bookkeeper, and two persons at the door. He had before spoken of these two persons having called about a parcel.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you take down the re-examinations, and all the cross-examinations - A. Yes.
Q. Is there nothing in them that will give any explanation - A. No, nothing that I recollect.
- WEST. I am clerk to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring - Messrs
               



            . Shields & Johns were correspondents of ours; they are bankers at Plymouth Dock - their notes are payable at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            's. On the 1st of December, 1820, I made up a parcel of their notes to be transmitted to Plymouth-Dock. It is usual, on the 1st of every month to return all we have collected in the preceding month. I produce a book which will shew what notes I packed up. The entry is not my own writing. I compared the sums with the entry, but not the numbers. The notes are paid daily, and in the evening they are pinned together and entered in this book, I compared the amounts. I packed up in this parcel 1316 l., and put Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            's seal on the parcel, after tying it in cartridge paper, and directed it to Messrs. Shields & Johns, Plymouth-Dock, on the left hand side. I made it up in the morning, put it in the strong box, and I think between half-past four and half-past five, delivered it to Painter, to be delivered at Russell's warehouse.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you certain it was between half-past four and half-past five o'clock - I cannot say positively, it might be something later - it might be near six. I delivered him three parcels.
Q. And after, that he had to go with letters to the post-office - A. It was his duty to deliver letters. I believe he took the letters out with the parcels - it depends on his own arrangements whether he would go to the coach or waggon-office first; his general custom was to take the letters and parcels together - I counted every note.
Q. How long has the defendant been in the banking-house - A. I have been there ten years, and I believe he was there before me. He was entrusted to receive large sums, as receiving clerk, and was scrupulously punctual in his accounts. I always considered him strictly honest.


                  RICHARD 
                  TILLETT
               



            . I am clerk at Sir J. Perring's banking house. It is my duty to enter the country notes paid at the counter. I have examined the book, and find entries of different notes of Shields and Co. paid in Nov. 1820. I deliver the notes I receive to Mr. Vile, who delivers them to West - we pin them together, and enter the numbers in this book, and pin them up in parcels. I have here an account of all notes of Shields and Co. received that month; the whole amount is 1316 l.; and I find by the book, that on the 5th of December, 110 l., 130 l., and 50 l. of the same notes were presented and repaid.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are the notes given to you, or handed over by another clerk. - A. They are paid by the cashier, who puts them in a drawer - I compare them with the counter book, to see that they agree, and then enter them. I find above 1000 l. of the same notes were repaid before the 15th of December.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know whether all notes issued by Shields and Co. are following numbers, or whether old notes are re-issued. - A. I cannot say. I only took the numbers, not the dates. I do not recollect ever seeing two of the same number.


                  AMBROSE 
                  COCK
               



            . I am cashier of Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            's. I pay the notes at the counter, and have examined the book produced. I find by my entry of 5th of December, that I paid one lot of notes 110 l., another of 130 l., the numbers of which notes correspond with those put in the parcel. On the 6th of December, I paid 160 l. more of them, and most of the rest come from bankers at the clearing house.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You cannot say from memory whether the notes you paid had been in before. - A. Certainly not; only by examining the book I find the same numbers were paid. I cannot say whether I have met with two notes of the same number.


                  JOHN 
                  CHASE
               



            . I am clerk at Russell and Co.'s waggon office, No. 12, Friday-street, and have been so nearly six years. It is my business to receive parcels and book them. On the 1st of December I recollect the defendant coming to the office with a parcel, and knew him before. He came about eight o'clock in the evening - we have no dial in the office, but I say it was near eight o'clock, because we were to have a supper that night at eight o'clock. He had a person with him, whom I afterwards saw at Guildhall - it was Nightingale; he had but one arm, and very red whiskers. I am quite sure he was with him. Painter produced a parcel to me, and paid 1 l. 2 s. 8 d. insurance on it. I locked it up immediately in an iron safe at the top of the warehouse, in the counting-house. I keep the key - there were four or five other valuable parcels there, worth 1400 l. or 1500 l. together. This parcel was insured for 450 l. I put it in the waggon, on Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock. I had kept the key all the time, and took it out of the safe about four o'clock, and locked it with the other valuable parcels in a strong box in the waggon, and saw the goods loaded over it - there was 95 cwt. put over it.
Q. At the time Painter brought it, did any thing pass between you - A. Yes; two persons came into the office nearly at the same time as him, to enquire about a parcel from Bridport; I referred to the weigh-bill and found no such parcel. Painter blamed me for not attending to him first, and asked if I meant to keep him all night; he did not ask for any thing to drink, though he generally did on other occasions, and he used not to appear in a hurry - the waggon left our office, at five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 3d of December - Willis was the waggoner, and Bury the guard; it arrives at Plymouth in about ten days, there was nothing to be delivered till he got to Blandford, where he would arrive on Wednesday the 6th. I never heard any complaint of the loss of the other valuable parcels.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The parcel was brought about eight o'clock in the evening - A. Yes; on Friday; I did not say, at Guildhall, that it was about seven o'clock; it was between half-past seven and eight - I did not say the key hung on a nail, that was the key of the strong box of the waggon. I did not know either of the two persons who called about the parcel; I never saw them afterwards - there were two people at the door, named Hodder and Maize, and who were examined at Guildhall.

MR. WALFORD. Q. The key of the strong box would be of no use to any body - No; it would take four or five men four or five hours to unload the waggon. I did not leave it till it was loaded.


                  DANIEL 
                  HOLLAND
               



            . I have been a porter at Russell's warehouse sixteen or seventeen years, and I recollect the night Painter was there with the parcel; I knew him before - I remember this night, because we had a supper given us; I am sure Nightingale was with him, he has but one arm, and very red whiskers; I stood at the window at the time they were there, and had seen Nightingale before. There was a very bright gas-light in the office, and outside too - they came about half-past seven o'clock.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MAIZE
               



            . I was groom to Mr. Russell. I had lived between two or three years there. I knew Paynter, and remember his coming to the office that evening, on account of the supper being given us; he came in with a person, whose name I know to be Nightingale, he had but one arm, and red whiskers.


                  THOMAS 
                  WILLIS
               



            . I am waggoner to Messrs. Russell, and drive from London to Blackwater, which is thirty-three miles. I drove on the Sunday morning, and left at Blackwater, on Monday morning, about eight o'clock - nothing was taken out while it was under my care.


                  ROBERT 
                  BURY
               



            . I was guard, and travelled with Willis; nothing was taken out while I was with it.


                  JOHN 
                  HOARE
               



            . I was waggoner to Messrs. Russell, for ten years. I received the waggon at Blackwater, and drove it eighteen miles, to Wortling - it stops there, to be taken by Frampton, who comes from Andover; nothing was taken from it while under my care. I left it between four and five o'clock on Monday evening.


                  DANIEL 
                  FISHER
               



            . I am a horsekeeper, at Worthing, in Mr. Russell's service, and have been so four or five years. I received the waggon, and watched it till about three o'clock in the morning, when Frampton drove it away.


                  JOHN 
                  FRAMPTON
               



            . I am a waggoner, in Mr. Russell's service, and have been so twenty-three years. I received the waggon from Fisher, and drove it to Salisbury. I got there at eight o'clock on Tuesday night - nothing was taken out while I was there.


                  OLIVER 
                  VILE
               



            . I am clerk at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            's. I receive the notes on the evening of the day; they are brought in, I deliver them to Mr. West, and did so with Shield's notes, in November, 1820. I am sure all the notes paid in November, were locked up, and afterwards delivered to West. I never heard of two notes of the same number and amount - I have been twelve years in the house.
MR. WEST, re-examined. I was present at the trial at Guildhall. This was produced in the defendants presence, as the parcel delivered at Plymouth (looking at it), it was shewn to Painter, the seal on it is not the genuine seal of Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            ; it resembles it - the P. S. and Co. on it, but I can say it was not made by Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring
               



            's seal; and the direction on the parcel is not my writing, and it is not the cover which I put the notes in - I do not know whose writing it is.
The parcel produced contained nothing but paper.


                  JOHN 
                  CHASE
               



            . To the best of my recollection. this is the parcel delivered to me by Painter.

                  MACHINSON
               



            . I was agent to the plaintiff's attorney, when the case was tried. This is the parcel produced at Guildhall.
Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant.


                  JAMES 
                  PITT
               



            . I live in New Broad-street, city. On the 1st of December, 1820, my wife was ill. I had been accustomed to leave a person named Nightingale to nurse her, and went to Compton-street, Clerkenwell, after her. I knew 
               
                  John 
                  Nightingale
               



             by having been to that house three or four times before, for his mother. I consider it to be about six o'clock when I got there, and my motive for thinking so is, I usually take tea at five, which would last about half an hour, and I think it would take half an hour to go there; it is a chandler's shop - Nightingale was in the shop. I staid there about an hour, and left a little after seven.
Q. From the time you went in till you quitted the house had Nightingale been out - A. I did not observe him out, and think if he had gone out his wife must have gone into the shop. I think it quite impossible that he could have gone to Friday-street.
MR. WALFOOD. Q. Did you look at any clock or watch - A. No. I have three children, one living in Whitechapel, one at Cambridge, and one at Sheerness.
Q. At the hulks - A. I am not bound to answer that question. There is no family connexion between me and Nightingale.


                  MARY 
                  LILLY
               



            . I know Mr. Pitt, and remember his coming to ask me to attend his father. I do not recollect the day he came; as near as I can guess, about six o'clock in the afternoon. Nightingale, my son, was at home. I had let my apartments the day before, and had been robbed, and went to consult him, whether I should leave the house or continue in it. I do not know what month it was, but I was robbed the day before, which was Thursday. I went there about four o'clock, and staid till the shop was shut up, about ten o'clock.
Q. Was he out of the house all that time. - A. Only in the shop, and at the door, and he went to the public-house to fetch the supper beer.
MR. WALFORD. Q. Were you secured at Guildhall. - A. No; I know my son is to be tried for something, but what I do not know.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your name was Nightingale, but you have been married since. - A. Yes.


                  SARAH 
                  NIGHTINGALE
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  John 
                  Nightingale
               



            . In December, 1820, I lived in Compton-street, Clerkenwell, and remember Mr. Pitt coming for my mother. On the 1st of December, about six o'clock, my husband was at home; then Pitt staid till about seven o'clock, or a little after. - My husband did not go out that evening, except for the supper beer, and then he went about his coat.
MR. WALFORD. Q. You know your husband is indict - 
               
                  ed 
                  A. Yes
               



            . I was not at Guildhall.
JURY. Q. What reason have you for recollecting the day Pitts called - A. On account of my mother being robbed on the day before.


                  JOHN 
                  NIGHTINGALE
               



            . I am indicted here for perjury. On the 1st of December, 1820, I lived in Compton-street;my mother came to me on business, and Pitt came that day for her to go to nurse his wife - he came about six o'clock, and staid an hour, or an hour and a half. I was not out of the house, except going to the public-house, till bed time.
MR. WALFORD. Q. How long had you know Pitt - A. About three years. I had visited him at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Perring

                  HARE
               



            , re-examined. Q. How long did the waggon stay at Worthing, before Frampton took charge of it - A. Four or five hours. Wortling is fifty miles off.

            . The waggon arrived at five o'clock at night, and left between two and three o'clock in the morning; it was under my care at the time. I was in the yard all the time.

            . I live with Mr. Samuel Adams, he is a hatter
. On the evening of the 4th of October, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came to buy a hat; I showed him several; I asked him 6s. 6d. for this one, he offered me 6s., which I agreed to take; he then said he wanted it made more fashionable - more narrow in front; I went to the end of the shop to get the iron to do it, when I missed the prisoner and the hat - I went out and turned up a court by the side of our house, where I saw him with the hat - I pursued him, and called, "Stop thief;" I did not lose sight of him till he was taken.

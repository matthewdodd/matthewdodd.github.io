WILLIAM ASCHCROFT, JUN
. On the 12th of April, at half-past ten o'clock, I was passing through Fenchurch-street, I felt a slight jerk at my pocket. I turned and saw the prisoner going across the road with his hand as if putting something into his pocket—a stranger said he had taken something out of my pocket—I took him and took my handkerchief from his breast-pocket—I held him five minutes and gave him to the officer—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner. I was passing—some one dropped the handkerchief—I took it up and somebody said it belonged to that gentleman—I gave it him—I never moved at all. Witness, He was walking off across the road—a stranger came up and said, "This has your handkerchief"—I turned the moment I felt the jerk.

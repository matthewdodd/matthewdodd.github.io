            , JUN. I am clerk to my father, whose name is Edward - he is a surveyor
. The prisoner was employed by us as a porter
, and to clean shoes; last Friday I hid myself in a closet in the office, from whence I could see where the money was kept, through a hole which I had made the day before; I saw the drawer open, and a hand put in and withdrawn again - I pushed the door open, and caught the prisoner with 3s. 6d. in his hand; he laid it down on the desk, and that money was missing from the drawer - he has been with us about eight months, and had 1l. per week.

            . The prisoner was given into my charge; he said distress was the cause of it- I went to his house, but saw nothing like distress.

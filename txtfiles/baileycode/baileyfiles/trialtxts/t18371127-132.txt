ELIZABETH SAMPSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of November, 2 sheets, value 1s., 3d., the goods of 



Matthias Powell, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE VANHESON
. I lodge at No. 9, Rose-lane, Spitalfields, and have lodged with Mr. Matthias Powell three years. These sheets were his property—I rented a furnished room of him—about twenty minutes past two o'clock on the 9th of November these sheets were on the bed—I returned home about two o'clock, having been absent about six minutes—I had been speaking to a neighbour, and my door was latched—I returned and saw the prisoner coming through the kitchen with a bundle under her arm—she asked if I could tell her where Mr. Martin lived—I said, "No," but if she would go next door with me, I could tell her—she threw the bundle down—I saw it contained the sheets, which had been on my bed—I then took her into custody.





THOMAS BISLEY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and have the property.





MARMADUKE LOVELL
. I have the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person that was then tried.




GUILTY
. Aged 53.—


Transported for Seven Years.

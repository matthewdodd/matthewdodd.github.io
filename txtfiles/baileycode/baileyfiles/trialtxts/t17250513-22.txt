             thus deposed: The Prisoner was a Lodger. I lost the Goods on the Wednesday, and on the Saturday following I distributed printed Advertisements to the Goldsmiths, and Pawnbrokers. The Goods were very remarkable, exactly described, and a Reward of 20 s. offer'd. I carried one of these Bills myself to White, a Pawnbroker, in Baldwin's Gardens, who positively denied that he had any such Goods in his House; but going thither again with a Search-Warrant on the Monday following, he presently confessed that he had the Plate, and deliver'd it up; but yet in the Afternoon, he sent his Servant to demand the Reward promis'd in the Advertisement. 


               Guilty val. 4 s. 10 d.

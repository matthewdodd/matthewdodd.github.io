            . I am a Constable in Wapping, and was call'd to assist the Headborough: According to Cook's Direction, we search'd Lovelock's House, and found the Goods they are charg'd with receiving. Cook inform'd us that he and one Bull, us'd to go out o'Nights, to get what they could, and that they always carry'd their Goods to the Prisoner, Lovelock's House. Lovelock and his Wife both, denied knowing any thing of the Goods, but upon search, we found them concealed: When they were taken, they made but very little Excuse for themselves, only said the Man that informed against them was a Rogue.

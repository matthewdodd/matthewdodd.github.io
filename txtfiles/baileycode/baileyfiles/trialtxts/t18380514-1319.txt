ELIZABETH SMITH
 and 



ELIZABETH BALDWIN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
21st of April, 3 pieces of handkerchiefs, containing 20 handkerchiefs, value 4l., the goods of 



Thomas Bosberry and another; and that Smith had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM HEWER
. I am assistant to Thomas Bosberry and another, in

Regent-street. On the night of the 21st of April the two prisoners came, and requested to look at some black merinoes—they then bought another article—in going to the other end of the shop to put it up, I thought I saw something gone; and when they were gone I missed three pieces of silk handkerchief—I went after them, and Smith threw these handkerchiefs from her before my face—Baldwin came into the shop with her, and I requested her to wait, but while I was looking for an officer she went off.

Smith. I am very sorry to be in such a situation, but it is through having a bad husband—I left my house, and did not know what to do, nor where to go—I owed a great deal of rent—the other prisoner knows nothing about it—she wanted some merino, but it was too high for her—she bought a pair of stockings.





JOHN MAGAZINE
 (police-sergeant U 166.) I produce a certificate of Smith's former conviction—I got it from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person.

SMITH—

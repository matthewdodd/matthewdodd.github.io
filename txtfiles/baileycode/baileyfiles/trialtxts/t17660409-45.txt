            . I live in Coventry-street, St. James's, and carry on several branches; watch-making
 is one: the prisoner was my journeyman
; he came to me about 16 months ago, to mend and sit up work in the shop. I missed a great number of watches (mentioning the particulars laid in the indictment ) I took the prisoner before a magistrate, and charged him with taking them; 4 of them were laid upon the table; he owned 3 of them belonged to me, and the other was the property of customer of mine. He owned he pawned them with Mr. Hodges, by whom they were produced; he owned to some of the others, to that of Mr. Lloyd's, Mr. Jomart's (which was pawned to Mr. Marriat) and a silver watch of Mr. Stubbs's, pawned to Mr. Brown.
Mr. Hussey deposed the prisoner pawned 4 watches to him.

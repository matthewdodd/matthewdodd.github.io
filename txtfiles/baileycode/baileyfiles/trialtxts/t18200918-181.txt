            . I am an officer in the East-India service
, and live in Bedford-row. On the 30th of August, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was just entering Bloomsbury-place


, with a lady on my arm, I felt something touch me, turned round, seized the prisoner, and saw him drop my handkerchief; he said,
"What have I done?" I said,
"You young rogue, what do you mean by saying you have not robbed me?" he said,
"There are two boys behind who took your handkerchief?" There were two boys four or five yards behind, but I saw it in his hand.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

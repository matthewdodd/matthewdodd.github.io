            . I was coming out of Mr. Pontifex's of Shoe-lane, and saw a crowd round the prisoner, she had her arm and leg tied up, as if she was lame; two womencame up, and loosed her leg and arms, and one of them fought with her, and she ran off as hard as she could, I followed her, and was telling a person about her impositions, and turning round to point her out, I saw all these things under her arm. I knew the gown, and the prosecutrix claimed it.

            . I am a carter
 at the King's Arms, Holborn-bridge. My daughter's box contained the property stated in the indictment, which was in my cart. I stopped at the end of May's-buildings, St. Martin's-lane


 - it was safe then. I went into a shop on the opposite side of the way, leaving an old man, named Dawson, in the cart; I returned in about five minutes, and saw the prisoner go between two coaches, get on the wheel, and take something out of the cart. I seized him as he stepped off the cart with the box; he broke away, but I stopped him immediately, without losing sight of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw it lay by the cart, and picked it up.

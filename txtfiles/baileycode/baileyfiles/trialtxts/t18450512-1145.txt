WILLIAM ORFORD
 was indicted

 for stealing 4 1/2lbs. weight of pork, value 1s. 10d., the goods of 



James Procter; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES PROCTER
. I am a cheesemonger, and live in St. Marylebone. On the 28th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, a woman called out that a man had stolen a piece of pork—I missed a piece—I ran out, and found the prisoner running up Bell-street, with this piece of pork, which is mine.

Prisoner's Defence. A man had just before given it to me.





JAMES CLOWLING
 (police-constable D 156.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction which I got at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 1st January, 1844, and confined three months)—he is the man, and he had three months besides for assaulting a constable.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

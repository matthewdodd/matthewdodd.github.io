             sworn.
I live in Princes-street, Leicester-fields; I have also a house in Mary-le-bone-fields



, where we sleep in the summer; and when I do not go myself, I always send a servant as a guard to the house; on the 14th of July I sent a servant not sleeping there myself; the next morning he returned to town; the next evening he went as before, and returned the same night; he informed us -
Court. You must not tell us that; is that all you know of your own knowledge? - Yes.

             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Vernon; his house was broke open on Sunday the 15th of July, at what time I cannot tell; I was not there.
When had you seen it last before? - The same morning; I left it about seven o'clock.
Did you leave any-body in it? - No, nobody; I returned to it again at about half past nine o'clock; as I was going in at the gates, I found two boards pulled off from the paling that goes round the garden, that was not done when I left it; I opened the gate and went in, and there were some long stakes laid across the gateway, I knew they were not there when I left it; I went into the house and struck a light.
Was it dark? - Yes; I looked about and saw there was a hole broke out, from the stable into the kitchen.
How large was the hole? - I cannot say, but it was large enough for me to go in and out, but not quite so easy as I could wish to do; after I perceived that, I was terribly frightened, for I did not know but there might be somebody in the house at that time; I went up stairs, and found my master's things all thrown about the floor in the dining-room, the drawers and scrutoire broke open, two knives, and a screw-driver which was broke, on the ground, all the cupboards up stairs were open; I went back immediately, and told my mistress of it; she desired me to return again as quick as I could; I went and took a man to stay all night with me, and that is all I know about the matter.

             sworn.
I am the wife of the prosecutor; I went to our house in Marybone-fields, on the Monday morning, the 16th of July, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw in the kitchen, the hole that had been made out of the stable; I found the scrutore up stairs broke open, and a great deal of linen lying about the room; upon examining, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. (Repeats them.) some of them belongs to

                   Vernon
               



            , my mother.
Have you seen those things since? - Yes, some part of them.
Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long might you have seen the riding habit before you was alarmed, that your house was robbed? - I saw it on the Monday morning.
Then from the Monday to the Saturday, you had not seen it? - No.
Were your servants used to go to your house at Marybone, when you were not there yourselves? - Yes, the porter.
Neither Mr. Vernon nor you had been there from the Monday to the Saturday? - No.
You had seen none of the things you missed since the Monday preceding? - No.

             sworn.
I live in Greek-street, Soho.
What are you? - I keep a house there.
Are you of any profession? - No, I am a person of a small fortune; I bought this riding habit of the woman at the bar and Gregory.

In what month? - I believe the beginning of August, but I cannot say.
Prisoner Bond. We were taken up the first of August.
What day of the week was it? - Either Monday or Tuesday, I am not certain; it was about two o'clock, the woman's son, a little boy, lived servant with me, as an errand boy; she came frequently to see her son, and met me one day in the passage, and asked me if I wanted a riding habit; I told her I did not want one much; she told me she knew a man that had one to dispose of, and would sell it reasonable, because his wife was dead, and he wanted money to pay the funeral charges; she came again the same day with it, and brought Gregory with her; I asked her the price of the habit; she said the man could afford to sell it cheaper, on the account he wanted money; she told me it was a guinea and a half; I gave her half a guinea, and told I had no more change; I told them any other time they chose to call, I would give them a guinea more; some time after I was out about some business, and Gregory, who owned it, called for the money.
Did he come with the woman before? - Yes, he stopped in the passage while she came to me; I paid her no more than half a guinea.
Mr. Knowlys. You say this woman's son served you as an errand boy? - Yes.
The woman told you there was a man had a habit to sell, who had lost his wife? - Yes.
She never represented that this habit was her's? - No.
You understood her to be bringing you this to accomodate a neighbour? - Yes.
You did not understand her as making any bargain for herself? - Certainly not.
You know this woman very well? - No, I do not.
I do not mean as having any intimacy with her, but you know her by sight as coming to your house to see her son? - Yes.
Court to Mrs. Vernon. Have you ever worn this habit? - Not above three or four times?
What did it cost new? - I believe about five guineas.

             sworn.
I know nothing of the prisoners committing the robbery, any further than what they told me; about the middle of July last, I was sitting in a room at 
               
                  George
                   Bragg
               



            's, No. 7, Long-acre.
What is Bragg? - A receiver; I was sitting there with Vandebus and Everard, and they told me they had done the house facing the Jews-harp-house, in Marybone-fields, and had got a great coat, and a pair of boots, which I saw in their possession, from that-house; Vandebus bought the coat and boots of Everard for five shillings.
Had you any conversation with them relative to this robbery? - No, only they told me that, and that it was done of a Sunday afternoon.
Do you know Mr. Vernon's house? - Yes.
Is Mr. Vernon's house opposite the Jew's-harp-house? - Yes.
What is the meaning of doing a house? - The meaning of it I suppose is the robbery.
Did they tell you at what o'clock in the afternoon? - Yes, between four and five,
Was any body in the house? - Nobody that I know of; they did not tell me whether there was or not.
Do you know any thing else? - Yes, I went with Gregory and Mrs. Vandebus, to Mrs. Lynus's; he went in, and I staid at the door; Gregory came out, and shewed me half a guinea.
Did Mrs. Vandebus go into the house? - No not when I was with her, she and I sat withoutside the door of the next house.
What did she come for? - To get the money to carry to her son.
Where was her son? - In trouble.
How in trouble? - In gaol; he had been in gaol about a week.
What had the son to do with this habit? - Nothing that I know of.
Do you know from her or from anybody else, where this habit came from? - Gregory said it came from the house opposite the Jews-harp-house.
Did he tell you when it came from there? - No.
Did the woman? - No.
Why did she go with you? - Because she was to have the money to carry to her son.

            ; I found this waistcoat, and this pair of boots on the bed. (Produces them.) I searched Mrs. Vandebus, and found the duplicate of the silk gown in her pocket.
Mr. Vernon. I will not venture to swear to the boots; my boot-maker is here, I believe he can.
Was there a pair of boots in your house at the time of this robbery? - Yes.
Was there a waistcoat? - Yes.
Mrs. Vernon. I know this waistcoat to be my husband's, from a mark on the back of it.
Was it in the house at the time of the robbery? - Yes.

I am a shoemaker; I made this pair of boots for Mr. Vernon.
Are you sure? - If they are Mr. Vernon's, there is his name in my own writing, withinside the top of the boot; I will rip it to see. (Rips it.) Here it is, my Lord.

            's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of the charge; I found Mrs. Lynus kept a very bad house, and I took my son away; I made a riding shirt for her, and she never paid me for it; she said she would transport me if it was possible; I have worked for Mr. Priddle, in Bond-street, sixteen years.

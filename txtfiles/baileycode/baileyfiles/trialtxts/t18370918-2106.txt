EDWARD BRADSHAW
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of August, 1 pair of trowsers, value 6s., the goods of 



Thomas Vesper and another.






WILLIAM JEFFERY WATSON
. I am salesman to Thomas Vesper and another. On the 17th of August I was standing at the door, and saw the prisoner likewise at the door—I turned my head to speak to a person—I directly saw the prisoner run off—I had some suspicion, and ran after him—I had some trowsers at my door at the time—by the time I got to the

prisoner, Scott had hold of him, with these trowsers, which were at the door just before, outside.

Prisoner. Q. When you saw me go away from the door, did some one give you information that a man had got a pair of trowsers? Witness. No.





WILLIAM SCOTT
. I live at No. 15, Exmouth-street, Stepney, and am a joiner. On this evening I saw the prisoner running, and trying to conceal these trowsers under his coat—I seized him—a struggle ensued, and I took the trowsers from him, and gave them to the man.

Prisoner. Q. Are you the first person that stopped me? Witness. Yes, and there was a mob round you, till the man came up—it was not more than a minute before he came—no one went back to the shop to say that a man had got a pair of trowsers.

Prisoner. I was walking behind two ladies, they made a bit of a stop, and said, "Look at those things there," I saw them, and took them up, and was going on with them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

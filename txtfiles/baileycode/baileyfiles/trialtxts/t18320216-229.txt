            , a market-gardener
, at Isleworth


. On the 21st of January, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner - he came to the door of the shed where these baskets were, and tried to lift the latch, but found it fast; he then went to a window, wrenched one of the shutters open, then wrenched two iron bars, which were across the window, and got in - I was concealed inside the place; he began to throw the baskets out - he threw sixty dozens out, and was shutting the window up that they should not be missed - I went round, and secured him; he must have opened the gate or climbed over to get to the premises.

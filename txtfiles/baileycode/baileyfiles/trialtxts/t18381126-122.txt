JOHN YOUNG
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of November, 84 combs, value 7s., the goods of

JOHN MACDONALD
. I hawk combs about the country. On the 24th of November, about ten o'clock at night, I went into a public-house at Brentford—I had seven dozen combs rolled in one parcel in my coat pocket—I found the prisoner there when I went in, and there were other persons drinking—I did not drink with them there—I went with the prisoner to a second public-house—I had my combs secure then—we were drinking a pot of beer together—I was not to say sober, nor yet drunk—I knew what I was about—I was standing against the fire, and felt something against my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner give a parcel to another man—the prisoner had spoken to him before, and given him beer—I turned and said "You have taken my combs"—I asked him to give them me, and he threatened to give me a knock of the head—I asked the other man to give them to me—he answered me the same way—I went out and told the policeman, and the prisoner was taken as he was coming out of the house—I do not know what became of the other man—about seven minutes elapsed between my going out, and returning with the officer.





JOHN HANSLOW
 (police-constable T 172.) The prosecutor came to the station-house—he had been drinking, but knew what he was about—he related this story, and I took the prisoner—he said some man had received the combs, and that man I have not found.

Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent—I know nothing about the combs.

Transported for Ten Years.

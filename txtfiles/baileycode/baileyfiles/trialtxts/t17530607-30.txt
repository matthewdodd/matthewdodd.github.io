            , at South Mimmes, in the county of Middlesex


. The prisoner had lodged in that house about eight nights.
Q. Is it a publick or private house?
Adkins. It is a private house. I came home from work, and missed my things, that is, a pair of leather breeches, a wig, a cloth waistcoat, a plad waistcoat, a pair of shoes, a shirt, two linnen handkerchiefs and a cap. I heard the prisoner was going for Barnet, I pursued and took him there, with all my goods upon him, except the shoes, which he said he had sold. Groom was along with me. (The goods produced, and deposed to.) The prisoner called at a house, and had two pints of beer, and there left Groom's two shirts.

            . I live at South Mimmes, where the other evidence lodged, and likewise the prisoner. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found my two shirts at a publick house, where he had left them in pledge for two pints of beer. We took the prisoner with Adkins's things upon him, except the shoes; and he directed us where the shirts were.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all of it, I was quite drunk.

WILLIAM WEBBER
 was indicted

 for stealing 136 yards of printed cotton, value 1l. 13s.; the goods of 



James Richmond Smith, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN GREENFIELD
. I am assistant to James Richmond Smith, a linendraper, of No. 133, Tottenham Court-road. On the 9th of April, about six o'clock, we had some printed cotton safe—I received information, and ran out—I saw a bag lying on the ground; I picked it up—it contained the 136 yards of printed cotton—it is my master's—it was stolen out of the shop.





JOB DICKS
 (police-constable E 44.) At a quarter before seven o'clock, on the 9th of April, I saw the prisoner going about Warren-street with this bag, and its contents under his arm—I crossed the way, he dropped the bag, and ran away—I ran and caught him—I was bringing him back and met Greenfield, who had picked up the bag—I am sure the prisoner is the person who dropped it.
Prisoner. I was standing at the corner of Warren-street, waiting for my mother—a respectably dressed gentleman asked if I would earn 6d.—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Go and wait, and I will bring you a parcel" he brought this parcel, and he saw the officer, and said to me, "Drop the bag, here in a policeman coming"—he ran down a mews, and the officer cried, "Stop him."

Witness. I called, "Stop him," meaning the prisoner—I saw no other man with him—he said, another man gave it to him, and he was not the party who had the bag, but I swear he was.





JOHN PACKER
 (police-serjeant E 14.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—"Convicted the 11th of Feb., 1845, and confined three months")—the prisoner is the person—he does no work—he associates with a gang of thieves.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 14th of February, about one o'clock, I was in Hart-street, Bloomsbury


, and felt a pull at my pocket - I turned round, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand; he was five paces from me, and concealing it under his apron. I seized him, and said,
"How came you to be so impudent, as to pick my pocket" - he said,
"It was not me, another man dropped it, and I picked it up" - there was nobody else near.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. (Written) I was returning from an errand, and in Hart-street I saw three boys running - one of them dropped the handkerchief - I picked it up, and called after them - they took no notice. I went on, and in a minute or two this gentleman came, and said, he had lost one - I said, if it is yours, take it. I have picked it up.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.

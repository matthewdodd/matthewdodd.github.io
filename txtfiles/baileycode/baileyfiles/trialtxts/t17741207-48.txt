: I found my handkerchief drawing out of my pocket; I turned round, and seized the prisoner with it in his hand; there were some boys behind him, who got the handkerchief from him: I secured him, and he was committed, he is so altered now, I don't know him; he was committed by the name of Phillips.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing about it; I am not the boy; I was put in Newgate very wrongfully.

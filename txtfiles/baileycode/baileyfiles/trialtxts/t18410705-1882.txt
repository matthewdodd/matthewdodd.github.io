1882. 




EDWARD TRIMLETT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of June, 1 breast-pin, value 10s., the goods of 



George Bode, from his person.






GEORGE BODE
. I am a clerk in the General Post-Office. I was standing among the crowd on the 29th of June, the Election day—I had a breast-pin in my breast—I received information, and missed it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. There was a great crowd? A. Yes—there was great excitement.





GEORGE BAKER
. I am a constable. I was in Guildhall-yard—I saw the prosecutor there, and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner take the pin out with his right hand—he dropped it—I collared him with my right hand, and picked the pin up with my left—I had a great deal of bother to get him out of the crowd.

Cross-examined. Q. Where were you standing? A. Directly opposite the Guildhall Coffee-room—I was on the right-hand side of the prisoner—the prosecutor was standing between us—he was nearer to the prisoner than I was—I am positive I saw the prisoner take the pin out, and then drop it on the ground.





THOMAS RADCLIFFE
. I was there—Baker called me—I did not see the prisoner take the pin—about ten minutes previously I had seen the prisoner working very busy in the crowd—I laid hold of him at the corner of Milk-street he laid down, and called "Murder! Rescue me! Knock the b—y policeman down!"—I had my hat beat in—I suppose there were forty or fifty persons upon us.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you constable to the Society for Preventing Cruelty to Animals? A. Yes—I was there out of curiosity.





HENRY HOMEWOOD
. I saw the prisoner take the pin out of Mr. Bode's handkerchief.

Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. On the left-hand side of the prisoner—he put his hand up, snatched the pin out, and threw it down on the ground, and Baker collared him.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

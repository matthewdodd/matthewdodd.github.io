                  ESTHER 
                  TURNER
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Turner
               



            , who is a salesman
, and lives in West-street, Spitalfields


. On the 12th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was told my door was broken open. I came down and found it so-it was fast when I went to bed. I missed between 10l. and 12l., in halfpence, out of the desk.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The robbery must have taken place between twelve and five o'clock in the morning.


                  JOHN 
                  TURNER
               



            . I am the nephew of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Turner
               



            . I went out about seven o'clock in the evening, and left the copper in the desk. The prisoner is quite a stranger to me. Mr. Turner has a son-in-law of the name of Beadle


                  JOHN 
                  GAY
               



            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 12th of June, about twenty minutes after two o'clock in the morning, I and Forbes saw the prisoner coming down Cow-cross, with a bag of halfpence on his shoulder - I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there? he said they were halfpence, that his name was Matthew Beadle, and that he was going from Mr. Turner's, of Spitalfields-market, to carry some halfpence to Covent-garden to give change. I told him that was the wrong way to Covent-garden - He said the cart was gone on with a load of potatoes, and there was not room in the cart for the bag. He said he was going to a coffee-house in Clerkenwell first to get some coffee. I told him he must go to the watch-house. He said Mr. Turner was a potatoe-dealer, and mentioned several potatoe-dealers in Cowcross. I went to the market, but could not find Mr. Turner's stall. I had a full opportunity of seeing the prisoner. I came back to the watch-house, found him gone, and the halfpence left behind him. On the 16th, I saw him at the watch-house again-Forbes had taken him. I have no doubt of his person.
Cross-examined. I had a great deal of conversation with him. I am positive he is the man.


                  JOHN 
                  FORBES
               



            . I am a patrol. I was with Gay, and saw the prisoner coming down Cow-cross. On seeing us, he crossed on the other side. Gay has spoken correctly. He was left with Newton at the watch-house-there was a man there on another charge. I returned to the watchhouse, and found the prisoner had made his escape. I am certain he is the man. On the 16th I found him in Spitalfields near Turner's house.
Cross-examined. I had never seen him before.


                  JOHN 
                  NEWTON
               



            . I was the constable of the night. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house about twenty minutes after two o'clock. I stood on one side of the table and he on the other. I did not suspect him from the references he gave. He said he wanted to go into the yard for a necessary purpose. I told him to follow me; I turned my back, and thought he was behind me - I heard the door open; I ran out and found him gone-he got away. On the 16th I saw him again, and am sure he is the man.
THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. Turner claimed the halfpence by the papers they were wrapped in.
Prisoner's Defence. I have witnesses to prove I was in bed at the time.


                  JAMES 
                  SNAITH
               



            . I am an upholsterer, and work for my father, in Paul-street. I remember the Monday that the prisoner was taken up, and the Wednesday before that, I lodged with the prisoner's father, in Clifton-street, Northgreen, Holywell-row, Curtain-road; he deals in asses-milk - I slept with the prisoner in the same bed. On the Wednesday night we went to bed together about eleven o'clock; the door was fastened inside. I got up between six and seven o'clock in the morning, he was still in bed. I awoke once in the night and found him in bed - I have no reason to think he was out of bed all night. In the morning, about six o'clock, a young man came into the room, he lodged up stairs, he is a japanner; he said he was going to work; the prisoner's father locks the door, and keeps the key. I remember his fastening the house that night, in the usual manner, atten o'clock, or a little before.
Court. Q. What makes you remember that night - A. Because we all went to bed together; he did not go to bed generally till after me, we slept in the kitchen. The prisoner's brother slept in the same bed with us. I lodged with the prisoner since Whit-Monday; that was the first time I ever lodged there.
Q. How long was that before this matter happened - A. I think about two, months.
Q. Are you sure you lodged there more than one month before that happened - A. Yes.

Q. 
            Whit-Monday was the 26th of May, and this happened on the 12th of June - A. I think I had lodged there two months, but am quite sure it was one. His father and mother, two sisters, and three brothers, supped there. My father lives in Paul-street, he is a cabinet-maker, and pays 60l. a year for his house.

Q. 
            Instead of being at your father's house, you sleep three in a bed at another's - A. Yes; I have not paid any thing for my lodging yet.

Q. 
            What are you to pay - 
               A. 
            Eighteen-pence per week. I do not know what I am to pay.
Q. How came you to know that Wednesday was the day the prisoner was charged with the robbery - A. I wassitting at my father's door on the Thursday morning, which was the next day after the robbery was committed. The prisoner's father came to me, and told me that he was taken up on suspicion. This was the next day after I had slept with him on the Wednesday.
Q. He was not taken up until the 16th. What reason have you to know that you slept with him on the Wednesday night - A. We all supped together that night. I removed somewhere else about a fortnight ago, but sleep there again now. I do not usually sup there, but was invited on that night, we sat down to supper, about nine o'clock - We had about a dozen boiled mackarel for supper; the prisoner's sister, who is married, was there, his grandmother, and the prisoner's brother's wife (twelve of us altogether). The prisoner's grand-mother and the married sister went home - I am certain the prisoner slept in the house.

            . I am the prisoner's brother. Snaith lodged at my father's house about Whitsuntide. I slept in the same bed with my brother and Snaith. I remember the Wednesday night before my brother was taken up.
Q. What do you remember it by - A. There was a young man named Boston, that lodged in the house, came down when we were in bed, and talked to us. My three brothers, two sisters, and father and mother were at home. I have a married sister, and grandmother - They were not there.
Q. Did Snaith sup with you that night - A. I do not remember. My grandmother did not sup there that night. If there had been a dozen mackarel for supper I should have remembered it. I do not remember that any person came into the room before I got up.

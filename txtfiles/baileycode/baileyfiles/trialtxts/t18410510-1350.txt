GEORGE BINKS
. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On We 21st of April, about a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning, I was on London-bridge—I missed my handkerchief, and turned round—a gentleman said, "If you have lost your handkerchief, one of those three has got it"—I

saw three persons walking about a dozen yards from me—I followed them, and collared two of them—the gentleman followed the other, who was the prisoner, and brought him up to me—I asked if either of them bad got my handkerchief—they all denied it—I insisted that one of them had got it, and as the policeman was coming up, the prisoner drew it from his breast—this is it—the other two got away—I was not aware I could detain them.

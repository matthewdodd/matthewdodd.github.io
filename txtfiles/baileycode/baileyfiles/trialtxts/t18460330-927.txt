REUBEN BIRD
 and 




ELLEN BIRD
 were indicted for

stealing 2 blankets, value 7s. 6d.; 3 sheets, 15s.; 2 table-cloths, 3s.; 1 bolster, 3s.: 6 pillows, 12s.; and 2 flat-irons, 1s. 6d.; the goods of 



Reuben Carter; and that Ellen Bird had been before convicted of felony.







ELIZABETH CARTER
. I am the wife of Reuben Carter—we live in Palmer's-buildings, Westminster. The prisoner lodged with me in a ready-furnished room—about seven or eight o'clock, on the 25th of Feb., I observed some feathers about—I went to the police-sergeant, who lives just below me—I asked him to come and go up stairs to the prisoners' room with me—the feathers were about the bedstead—I found Ellen Bird had cut the bed up, and pawned the rest of the things—I asked her what she cut the bed up for—she asked me to forgive her—I gave her in charge—I missed two blankets, three sheets, a bolster, two table-cloths, and the flat-irons—these now produced are them—they are mine—Reuben Bird was out at work all day, and Ellen Bird was at home.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. There was furniture, such as chairs and tables, in the room? A. Yes—I do not think Reuben Bird had anything to do with it—Ellen had filled the bed up with rags and stockings, and taken the feathers out.





JOHN ROBERTS
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce these articles—I took in the greater part of them from the female prisoner.





EDWARD TRUELOVB
 (police-constable B 13.) I went and searched the house—I found twenty-nine duplicates.





HENRY WRIGHT
 (police-constable B 133.) I produce a certificate of Ellen Bird's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 12th Aug., 1845, and confined four months)—she is the person.

ADAM BUSH. I am a cutter
 at the Bedford eating-house, Bedford-street


. On Thursday, the 12th of October, about ten o'clock, I missed a sovereign and two shillings from my box, which I had seen safe on Sunday, and locked it up; the key was in my pocket - the prisoner slept in the same room - I told him of it; he denied taking it - I gave him in charge, and at Bow-street he said, that at three o'clock in the morning, he got out of bed and took the key from my pocket, and took the sovereign from my box.

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to the house, and took the prisoner - he said he bought a coat with part of the sovereign; I asked for the change - I followed him down to the cellar, and saw him take up 11s. out of the earth.
Prisoner. Q. Did he not say he would make it up? A. He said he would, if the prisoner's father would pay the money; but he said, he had made up so much, the law should take its course.

            . I made him no promise; I went to his father, who said he had settled so many things, the law should take its course.

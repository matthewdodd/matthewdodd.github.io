            . The prisoner is what we call a Scupple Hunter
, that haunts the keys. I have known him a good while; I did not see him taken, but I found some hogsheads of tobacco cut open on Galley-key.

            . I had charge of a lighter of 62 hogsheads of tobacco; going with my lanthorn, I saw the prisoner betwixt the casks; we searched him, and found this tobacco, (producing some) which was placed all round his body under his waistcoat, and there was some gone out of the hogsheads.

            , the constable, confirmed the testimony of the last witness.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to sleep between the hogsheads, and this man waked me; I went away; they called, stop thief; I did not know I had any tobacco about me.

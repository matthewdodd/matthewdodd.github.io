THOMAS BENNETT
 was indicted

 for stealing 11 yards of mousseline-de-laine, value 1l; 1 shift, 2s; 12 yards of lace, 3s; 2 caps, 4s; and 4 yards of ribbon, 2s; the goods of 



Henry Avis, from the person of 



Charlotte Gap; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN AVIS.
 I am the wife of Henry Avis, of No. 25, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On Saturday evening, the 27th of March, I sent Gap, my servant, to Wilton-street, for a bundle, it was to contain mousseline-de-laine and other articles—she returned without it—it has not been found.





CHARLOTTE GAP.
 I am servant to Mr. Avis. On the 27th of March, she sent me to No. 22, Wilton-street—I received a bundle—I saw a dress of mousseline-de-laine, and the other articles named in it—I was taking it home, and the prisoner came up to me in Dean-street—I had not seen him before—I am sure it was him—he did not say anything, but snatched the bundle from me, and ran away—I ran after him.





WILLIAM NOWLAN
 (police-constable B 56.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief" and saw the prisoner running with a bundle—I pursued him, but he got away over a wall—I took him the next morning in his mother's house—I told him I took him for this bundle—he said he knew nothing about it—I am quite sure he is the person who had the bundle, and who was getting over the wall—Gap knew him immediately.





GEORGE BANHAM.
 I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted the 24th of Sept. 1845; and confined six months; six weeks solitary)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY.† Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

A copy of the record of the trial and conviction of 
               
                  John 
                  Lamden 
               



             read in Court; wherein it appeared, that he robbed the prosecutor, Mr. Bigott, of the watch, seal, a guinea, and a quarter guinea, on the highway, in the county of Essex, on the 20th of September, 1768, and was tried and capitally convicted for the same at the Essex assize, February 28, 1769.

                  Bigot 
               



            , Esq; On the 20th of September last in the evening, going home to my house at Upton in Essex, attended by my servant, about a mile beyond Stratford


, 
               
                  John 
                  Lambden 
               



             attacked me and my servant, and robbed us both. I prosecuted him at Chelmsford, and he was convicted. But before that I applied to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , who advised me to put out hand-bills. I did. After which, I was informed a man was apprehended, offering my watch to pawn. By his being apprehended, I came at the knowledge of Lambden. I gave evidence against him on the trial. It was a Pinchbeck metal watch and seal; the watch was ordered to be kept, in order to be produced on this trial.


                  John 
                  Nash 
               



            . I live at the corner of Strutton-ground, with Mr. Hulsey, a pawnbroker. On the 22d of September last, the prisoner came to our house, with this watch, (producing a Pinchbeck metal watch) and asked fifteen shillings on it. I was told there was another man came with him to the door, but I do not know who he was. I heard that man say, Don't take less than fifteen shillings upon it. I had read the hand-bill from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , so I saw the watch answered to the bill. I asked him how he came by it, or whose watch is it? He said, What was that to me. I shewed him the hand-bill, and told him it was stole. I sent the boy in the shop for an officer. The prisoner said, You may keep the watch, but I shall go. He went away, and went down Strutton-ground, and I after him. He walked till he came to the bottom, where there was another man waiting for him. They looked back, and saw me, and immediately they ran towards Tothill-fields Bridewell. They found I got ground of them; then they parted. The prisoner asked me what I wanted with him; he then was walking on. I then went immediately to Mr. Wright, at Bridewell, and said, Here is the watch, and there is the man; pointing to the prisoner: Then he, I and another person went and took him upon the Green. He made some resistance. We took him into Bridewell. There we examined him. He was very resolute. We found this pistol loaded in his pocket ( producing a flat pocket pistol): He said, he bought the watch of a journeyman baker. He was examined afterwards before a magistrate, and confessed he had it of Lambden.
Prosecutor. Lambden was a journeyman baker.
Nash. The last time he was examined before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , was about a fortnight or three weeks after; then he said he had the watch of Lambden. Lambden was taken about three days after. Lambden was found out by a letter that was sent to some person.
Prosecutor. This is my watch ( holding it in his hand) which I was robbed of in Essex by Lambden.

                  Wright 
               



            , the turnkey of Tothill-fields Bridewell, confirmed the evidence given by Nash, as to the taking and searching the prisoner, and his confession.

            . I keep the Red-Lion alehouse, Christopher-yard, Southwark. I have known the prisoner three years. I never saw Lambden but twice in my life. He came to my house the 14th of last September, and asked if I could lodge him. About ten minutes after that, the prisoner came in. They drank together, and then they and two others went all up stairs and lay in one room, where were two beds. I do not know whether they were bedfellows or not; they both lay in one room. I saw Lambden and the prisoner together. Also on the 16th, Lambden had about a pound and a half of beef-steakes dressed in my house. The prisoner was in my house before he came in. Lambden asked him to eat with him; he did, they had a pot of beer and a glass of brandy. This was the very same Lambden that was tried at Chelmsford. I was also there upon the trial.
Prosecutor. The seal was found upon Lambden, when he was taken.
Prisoner's Defence.
I received that watch of 
               
                  John 
                  Lambden 
               



             to pawn for him. I lit of him promiscuously in Westminster. I innocently went to pawn it, and the pawnbroker stopped it. He asked me how I came by it. I said, I had it of a young man to pawn, who was at the door, at that time. When the man said it was advertised, and shewed me the bill, I went out of the shop to the young man, to clear myself, but he was gone up the street. I followed him, and the pawnbroker came after me. I told Lambden I was stopped with the watch, and begged of him to come back. He ran away directly. I never ran, I walked away. I lived with Mr. Hobbs's father at Stanmore. He is upon the jury, please to ask him my character, and also Mr. Fulcher.
To his Character.

                  Fulcher 
               



            . I never heard any thing amiss of the prisoner before this. I knew him when he lived with two bakers. I have trusted him, and he has paid me.
Tussin Hobbes. The prisoner lived with my father a little while. I know but very little of him. I can say nothing as to his character for or against.

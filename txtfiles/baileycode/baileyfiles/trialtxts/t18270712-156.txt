            . I am the wife of Alexander Simpson, a private in the Coldstream Guards
. I have known the prisoner about eighteen months, but had not seen her for twelve months, till the 28th of May, when she came to me in great distress, without clothes or food; I took her in, and kept her till the 30th of June, when I went out, and on my return I missed these articles - she was out, but came home about a quarter-past ten o'clock at night; she took off my gloves and laid them on the table - they fell off, and some duplicates fell out of them; I said nothing, but on Monday went to the pawnbroker's, and there found my property, and gave her in charge.

            . I am an officer. I went to the prosecutrix's house and took the prisoner; she said she knew nothing about it; I asked her how those duplicates came in the glove; she then said she had taken them, and hoped Mrs. Simpson would forgive her.

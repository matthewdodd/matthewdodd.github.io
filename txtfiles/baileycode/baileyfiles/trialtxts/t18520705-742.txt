, stealing 1 coat and 1 shawl, value 25s.; the goods of

THOAMS STAGG
. I drive an omnibus. On 25th June, about a quarter past 9 o'clock, I was at Whitechapel Church, and asked the prisoner to attend to my horses—I left him with the omnibus, came back in four or five minutes, and the omnibus was gone—I left my great coat and shawl on the omnibus, and a coat and shawl belonging to my conductor—I have not seen them since.





JOHN MITCHELL
. I am conductor of the omnibus. I left a coat and shawl on the top of the omnibus, behind the driver's seat—I left the omnibus, and when I came back it was gone, and the things also—I have not seen them since.





SAMUEL TAYLOR
. I am street-keeper of Whitechapel. On Friday morning, 25th June, about 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner with the omnibus a few yards from Whitechapel Church—he was standing by the side of the horses, and the coats were on the omnibus—I afterwards found the omnibus in Prescott-street, half a mile off—there was no one with it, and the coats were gone.





WILLIAM KENTISH
. I am an omnibus conductor. I was minding my own omnibus, and saw the prisoner sitting on the box of this omnibus, and saw him drive the houses off—I did not see where be stopped.

Prisoner's Defence. Stagg asked me to mind the horses a few minutes; he was gone a long while, and I left a boy to mind them; the coats were safe then.

JOSEPH BRAY
 (policeman, H 43). I produce a certificate (read: "Central Criminal Court; James Weight, convicted Nov, 1846, having been before convicted; confined one year")—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.

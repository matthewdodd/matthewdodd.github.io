DANIEL DESMOULINS
. I live in Gainsford-street, Horselydown, and am warehouseman to William Merry and another, of Whitechapel. On the 27th of Sept. we had some firkins of butter in the warehouse—I received information between eleven and twelve o'clock, and missed a firkin of butter from the warehouse—the carman went after the man—the firkin was brought back to the warehouse—it was their butter.





GEORGE TEAKLE
 (police-sergeant.) I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and overtook him with the tub of butter on his shoulder, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning.

Prisoner. Q. Was it not on the ground? A. No, on your shoulder.

Prisoner. I saw a man put it down at the corner of Petticoat-lane; I went up, and the policeman came and took me.





GEORGE TEAKLE

re-examined. On the way to the station he tripped me up, and kicked me violently—he said he would kick my b—y guts out—I was so ill the next day I could not move.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

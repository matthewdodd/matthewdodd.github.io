             (Police-constable N 217). On the 26th of April I was at my window in Church-street, Hackney - I saw the prisoner coming down the grove with a great coat; two more men were behind him - he was walking very fast, and when he turned into the main road, he ran as fast as he could; I ran after him for about ten minutes, and took him - while he was running he threw the coat down in the dirt; this is it - he said at the station that he bought it of the two men who were with him, for 2s. - the other two had run off; it was a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and he was coming from the prosecutor's.

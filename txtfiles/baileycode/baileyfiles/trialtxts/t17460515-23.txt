Q. How came you to discover these Persons?
White. The Boy was in Custody, that was the Way I came to hear of the Things.

             and I sat at the Alehouse Bench opposite to that Gentlewoman's House.

Q. When she said she would not give two Guineas, what did she say she would give?
Davis. One Guinea my Lord.
Q. What then?

Court. You said something of her Husband's getting out of Bed.
Davis. He got out of Bed and gave a Guinea to change.
Q. What then?
Davis. Then we went away directly.
Q. Was that all that passed ?

            (to the Prisoner Kipping) Will you ask this Witness any Questions?
Prisoner. When you met me on the Stairs did I squeeze you?
Body. I did not say it was you; I said it was James's Daughters, and, my Lord, we found this Fellow, Burn, (the Prisoner) in the Cock-Lost at this Merrit's House: We open'd a litle Place where he sat, and I said to my Brother Constable, shoot him, if he won't come down; with that he came down directly; I got away immediately, knowing what Place we were in being so very near Black-Boy-Alley, and knowing what desperate Folks have been there.

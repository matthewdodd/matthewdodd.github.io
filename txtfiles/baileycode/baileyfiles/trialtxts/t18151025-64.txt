            . I have the repairing of Burlington House


. The two prisoners were employed upon the premises as plumber's labourers

. I watched the prisoners into the plumbery, where they melt the lead. I saw them take some old lead, and concealed it under their clothes. When they were going out, in about five or ten minutes afterwards, I stopped them, and took them into a little room adjoining the porter's lodge when they dropped the lead from them; they then owned their guilt, declared their contrition, and offered if I would let them go never to be guilty of the like.
Lead produced, and sworn to.

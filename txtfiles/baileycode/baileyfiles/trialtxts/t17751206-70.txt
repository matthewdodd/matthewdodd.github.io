             sworn.
My house is in George-yard, Lombard-street


. Upon Sunday the 5th of November
 my servants came to me in the country, and told me my house in town was broke open; I came to town the same night and found the chest of drawers broke open: I obtained a search warrant, and at the prisoner's house in Houndsditch I found four of my shirts, three of my servant
s, and a pair of sheets; I cannot swear to the sheets: the prisoner did not choose at first to let us in; he said he had not the key, but found it afterwards, and we went in and found the things.
Mrs. HARROP sworn.
The sheets are my husband's: I was present when they were found in the prisoner's apartment; he said he bought them of two men: that if we had been there an hour sooner we should have seen them, and he could produce them in a day or two.

             sworn.
My master's house was broke open upon the 5th of November: a pane of glass was taken out of the garret window; the padlock to the bar of the window was broke and the bar taken out; and the window opened: there was a great quantity of things taken away: I saw the mark of dirty feet at the window where they came in. I saw the window safe at twelve at noon: I went up stairs in the evening for a book, and found the house in great disorder.

             sworn.
I saw the garret window fast at four in the afternoon: at seven we found the window broke open: the next is an empty house, the roof of that house communicates with Mr. Harrop's, so that there is a passage from the one to the other by the gutter.

JOSEPH NEWIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of December, 3 fowls, value 9s., the goods of 



Edward Rogers.






WILLIAM CHURCH
. I know the house and premises of Mr. Rogers, near Kingsland turnpike—he keeps fowls—on the 8th or 9th of December I saw three fowls sitting on the grain-tub—at a quarter past twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner and another lad come round the gate—the other had something in his hand by way of enticing the cock, and the prisoner caught a fowl in his hand—I ran for the policeman, but could not find him—I came back, told Rogers, and he missed the three fowls which had been on the grain-tub—I am sure the prisoner is one of the boys—I had seen him once before.





CHARLES GIBSON
. I was with Church on Kingsland-green—we saw this lad and another make a snatch at the fowls—we ran for the policeman, and when we came back the lads and the fowls were gone.





ANN HOBDELL
. I bought a fowl of a respectable woman—she asked me 2s. for it—I gave her 1s. 9d.—she said she lived at the toll-bar down the street—I cannot find her—I bought it about six weeks ago, in December.





THOMAS JOHNSON
. I was in Hobdell's shop about six weeks ago, when the prisoner brought in a Poland fowl for sale—it had a mixed top-knot—I cannot say what he asked for it.





GEORGE HOBDELL
. I bought two Poland fowls of the prisoner—one I put into the pens, the other I did not—Mr. Rogers came and claimed the one in the pens, the other I sold.





JOHN HOLLAND
 (police-constable N 234.) I was on duty on the 26th of January, and took the prisoner, from Church's information—there was another boy with him, who ran off.





HEZEKIAH WILMER
 (police-constable N 202.) I produce the fowl.





EDWARD ROGERS
. I live at Kingsland-green. This is my fowl—I lost three—I found this at Mr. Hobdell's shop.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

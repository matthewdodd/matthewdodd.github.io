PATRICK BROWN
. On Sunday, the 16th of September, about three o'clock, I was coming home, and met the prisoner in Holborn—she asked me to go to her lodging—I said I would not—she then put her hand into my breeches, and took out 7s. 3d., and 2 farthings—I had a half-crown, three shillings, one sixpence, and the rest in copper—I held her till the policeman arrived.





RICHARD LOCK
 (police-constable F 148.) The prosecutor called for me, and I took the prisoner to the station. I had seen them standing talking together.





ANN CLARK
. I searched the prisoner at the station—I found in her bosom a half-crown, two shillings, and one sixpence-and one shilling and three pence, and two farthings in her pocket.

Prisoner. I had seven shillings—I put it into my bosom—I met this fellow, and he said, "Come, and I will treat you"—I said, "I want no treat"—he said, "Stop, I will treat you"—he stood talking, and then said, "You have robbed me of my money"—I said, "What do you mean? I will stand here till the policeman comes"-and they took me to the watch-house-before the prosecutor went to the watch-house he said he had half a sovereign.





RICHARD LOCK

re-examined. The prosecutor said he had half-a-sovereign and had changed it and bought some grub, but he told me the next morning, before be heard what was found, how much he had lost.




GUILTY

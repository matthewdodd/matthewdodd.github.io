JOHN DUNN
. I was midshipman's-stewaxd of the Castor frigate—she was lying at Chatham—I had 213l. on my person, besides a little silver, when I left Chatham on the 12th of February—there were thirty-four £5 notes, one £10 note, thirty-three sovereigns, and some silver—the notes were in one purse, the gold in another, and the silver loose in my pocket—one purse was a foreign one, which I had bought in Spain, and the other an English one—they were both red—I came by the coach from Chatham, on my way to London—we got to Dartford about seven o'clock—the axletree broke there, and the coach turned over—I was outside, and was stunned by the fall, as I pitched on my head and shoulders—I had two pairs of trowsers on, and the money was in the pocket of the inside pair—I came to myself while I was on the ground, and was carried into the first public-house—I went from there to another public-house and inquired for a lodging Hawkins was there when I went in—she said she could let me have a bed and a room, that it was but a poor one, and she did not know whether it would do for me or not—I stopped at the public-house a short time and took out my money, and counted it to sec that it was all right—the people there saw it—it was quite right at that time—after remaining there a short time I went with Hawkins to look at the lodging—I observed the prisoner Gell in the public-house, but neither of the men—when I came out with Hawkins I saw both the male prisoners standing outside the door, and Gell with them—Hawkins spoke to them as we passed—she borrowed a candle from a neighbour, and took me to a house not far from the public-house—she showed me the room, and said, "Here is the bed and the room; I Don't know whether it will Do"—I said, "Any thing will do as long as I am safe; I have a little money in my pocket and don't wish to lose it"—she said, "You are perfectly safe, sir; nobody comes here but me"—I asked her to get me a drop of porter, and said if she had not got money I could

give her half-a-crown from my pocket—she did not take any money of me, but said something about her husband which I did not understand—she went away without getting the porter, and I went to bed, and went to sleep—I awoke in the morning between five and six o'clock—I had left my trowsers, the money was in, inside the others, and placed them by the side of the bed—when I awoke in the morning it was very dark, and I fell over them in the middle of the room—one pair was separated from the other—I picked them up, searched my pockets, and found both purses, with the Dotes and gold gone—the silver remained—there was a half-crown, and, I think, two sixpences—I ran into the street, and met Pearce the constable—he went back with me to the house, but found nobody there—I have seen both ray purses since—I had described them.

wkins. He followed me up stairs, and said, "You take this money, for I mean to live with you"—he next said, "I have a wife and one child, bat if you will but live with me, I will never go home to her any more—take that money, and do what you like with it." Witness. I did not say anything of the kind—she did not stop half a minute in the room—I had no conversation with her at all, except about the lodging—I did not make any proposition to live with her, nothing of the kind—she told me she was a married woman, and was going to her husband.





WILLIAM LUCAS PEARCE
. I am high-constable of Dartford. I saw the four prisoners in the course of the day in question—when the coach broke Down, I was sent for—the prosecutor was hurt, and I suppose 150 people were about—I observed the two female prisoners among the crowd, very busy among the sailors—there were five or six sailors among the passengers—Weyman and Hawkins have lived at Dartford together, as nun and wife, since November last—I occasionally see Haydon, and on the day the coach was overturned they were all four together—Gell was with one of the sailors, and as she came by, I heard her say to Hawkins, it appeared to me, that one of the sailors had got plenty of sovereigns, but it was tied so d—tight in, that she could not get at it, but she would bare it before morning—about five o'clock next morning Mr. Dunn called me up, and told me of his loss, and I went to Hawkins's and Weyman's lodging—they occupied that room—it is a detached part of the premises of the Granby public-house, let off in separate tenancies to labouring people—the other two prisoners lodged on the opposite aide of the yard.

Haydon. You did not see me that day, for I had been very ill, and came from Gravesend; and when I came home, I went to bed at Mrs. Brown's—You never saw me before in your life. Witness. Yet, I did—Mrs. Brown's husband keeps the Granby, which is opposite the church.





GEORGE WEYMAN
. I am the prisoner's brother, and live at Northfleet, which is about five miles and a quarter from Dartford. On the night of the 8th of February, my brother came home about twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess—he asked me if I could put him over the water—I said yes. I would if I could, I thought I could get a boat down at my master's—he went down with me, and he ran the best part of the way—we got the boat, launched her about a dozen yards into the water, and got in—we rowed round the causeway, which is the best part of a quarter of a mile, and there found the two females and Haydon waiting for us—they got into the boat, and I rowed them over to Grays, and they landed there—when I got ashore, Tom gave me a sovereign—when we got about a dozen yards, Haydon said, "How much did you give him, Tom?"—he said,

"A sovereign"—Haydon said, "D—his eyes, give him another, for he has well earned it"—he gave me another, and then said, "You must stand something to drink out of it"—I said, "Yes, I will, and thank you too," and we went across the wharf—Gull caught hold of my arm, and said "You have no occasion to say any thing, for they told me not to tell you but we have got about 500 of them altogether, you have no cause to say any thing that you put us over the water, for I dare say you will hear of this in the morning"—we went to the public-house—the male prisoners kicked at the door, but they were all in bed, and we could not getany—we then went to the White Hart, and then to the Bull and the King's Arms, but could not get any thing—I then left them, and came across the water with master's boat, and put it safe.

COURT. Q. Was Gell an acquaintance of yours before? A. No—she was quite sober—I have seen Hawkins before with my brother.

WEYMAN. It is all false—he was out that night stealing turnips—he said in the boat that he had been out to look for a sheep, but could not get one. Witness. I and three more were going to get a mess of turnips that night, but I did not go—by a mess, I mean a few in a handkerchief.

HAWKINS. I heard him say in the boat that he got his living by thieving. Witness. I did not.





CHARLES JAMES MURRAY
. I am a constable of Uxbridge, which it about thirty miles from Dartford. On Friday evening, the 10th of January, I saw the two female prisoners at the Jolly Ostlers public-house, at Uxbridge—on the following morning (Saturday) I saw Haydon coming up the street with two reputed thieves—on Sunday I read the Hue and Cry, and in consequence of a description contained in it, I went to the Jolly Ostlers again between nine and ten o'clock that morning with Darvill and Birch—we went into the back parlour, and found the four prisoners at breakfast—I asked them where they came from—Haydon said they came from Reading in Berks—I said, "Have not you been to Dartford, in Kent, lately?"—they said not—I had the Hue and Cry in my hand, and said, "I suspect you of a robbery, and will read you this, and then will ask you some questions"—I asked them their names—Hawkini described herself as the wife of Weyman, and Gell as Haydon's wife—I then said, "You are the very persons I want"—I read the paragraph to them, and said, "Do you still persist in saying you have not been at Dartford in Kent?"—they said they had not—I said, "You are my prisoners; I have come by order of the Magistrate, and shall search you"—I first searched Weyman, and found two £5 bank notes in his fob, also this green purse, nine other £5 notes, and eleven sovereigns in his breeches pocket, making 66l., and 18s. 6d. in his other pocket—I asked him how he accounted for the money—he said Nance (meaning Hawkins) had given them to him—I directed Darvill to search Haydon, and while he was Doing so, I heard something drop from Haydon—I said to Darvill, "Look out, there is some money dropped"—I looked round, and he had his foot partly on it—Darvill picked it up, and gave it to me—it was this new purse, containing eight £5 and one £10 bank notes, and six sovereigns, making 56l.—I asked him how he accounted for having so much money—he said Tom (meaning Weyman) had given it to him—when Weyman said Hawkins had given it to him, I said to Hawkins, "How came you by so much?"—she said a gentleman had given it to her—nothing was found on Gell—I took all four into custody—in consequence of something Haydon said, I took George Weyman, the brother, into custody, but found nothing

on him—he gave me precisely the same account as he has given to-day.





JOHN BIRCH
. I am a constable. I have heard Murray's evidence—it is correct—I searched Hawkins and Gell, hut found nothing on them—I fetched their bundles down from up stairs—Weyman and Hawkins claimed one of them, and in that I found a pair of trowsers, in the pocket of which I found this red purse, empty—after they were committed, the two male prisoners had a quarrel, and Haydon said that Weyman had done him out of the greater part of the money, that he did not have his share—Weyman then asked me how many sovereigns the sailor had said he lost—I said thirty-three—he then said, "There now, d—You r eyes, You only accounted for nine and twelve; I believe the sailor lost all he said he did lose, and you have done me out of my share of the money."





JAMES DARVILL
. I am a constable. I accompanied the officers, and niched Haydon—I found this purse in his pocket—I also picked up a green purse, which Murray called my attention to—it had 56l. in it.





JOHN HAWKES
. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On the 31st of January, I received instructions to forward 600£5 notes to the Navy pay-clerk at Chatham—it was for a ticket drawn by the paymaster of the navy, Sir H. Parnell, for 600l. to pay away—I don't know to what ship—I entered in the books 400£5 notes from No. 18, 401 to 18,800, dated 20th December, 1836, and 200£5 notes, from No. 20,401 to 20,600, dated 31st December, 1836—I made the entry, and Mr. Williams gave the money to another clerk.





JOHN WILLIAMS
. I am a clerk in the Bank. On the 31st of January I delivered the 600£5 notes to Mr. Geddes, another clerk.





ALEXANDER JAMES GEDDES
. I am a clerk in the Bank. I received the parcel of notes in question—on the 1st of February, I took them to Chatham—I delivered them to Mr. Wright, the Navy pay-cashier there.





WILLIAM THOMAS WRIGHT
. I am one of the clerks in the Navy Pay-office in his Majesty's Dock-yard at Chatham. On the 1st of February I received from Geddes a parcel containing 600£5 notes—I paid off the crew of the Castor frigate with them—I did not take the numbers of the notes I paid, but I paid off the frigate with the same notes I received from Mr. Geddes—I had no other notes in the office.





JOHN DUNN

re-examined. These two purses, one found in Weyman's bundle, and the other on Haydon, are both mine—one contained the gold, and the other the notes—they are both red—this £10 note, found on Haydon, is mine, and was one of the notes I had on my person that day—I had but one £10 note—I know it by the blot, and having it given me as a present for my good conduct when the ship was paid off.
(The notes produced by the officers corresponded with the numbers and dates referred to by the witness Hawkes.)

Weyman to
MR. DUNN. Q. How did you first come into the Granby publec-house? A. I went in and called for a pint of beer—I did not call for a glass of grog, and turn to the fire—I did at the first public-house I went into, but I did not drink any of it—that was exactly where the coach broke down.

Haydon. Before he saw the purse opened, which was found on me, he said that his purse had a tassel on it; and when it was turned out, he said it had, two tassels. Witness. It was just as it was when I lost it—I cannot say whether it had one or two tassels on it.


Hawkins. That is not the purse he gave me the money in. Witness. I never gave her any money—I went to bed about ten o'clock—I was not in her company longer than going from the public-house to her lodging—I played two games at cards, but not with her—I did not give her a farthing—I did not say that the money should be hers as long as it lasted, and I liked the place very well—I did not take any liberties with her—she did not stay in the room a minute—she did not bring me any supper—I never told her to get me some fish for supper.

Hawkins. you gave me the money to stop and live with you—I will take my oath of it—that is not the purse you gave me the money in; it belongs to this man, and he can bring witnesses to prove it—that red purse is yours, and that you gave me the gold in—he said he did not care about his wife as long as he could get one to please his fancy, I should have his money—the other three are innocent of it—when the money was given to me Weyman was the proper person for me to give it to—he asked hot I came by it, and I said I had it given to me—I live with him, and gave him the money.

Weyman's Defence. When I asked her how she came by the money, she said, "I had it given to me"—I said, "Did you?"—she said, "Yes I had, so help me God," and then I accepted it.

ELIJAH VENTHAM. I live at Hounslow


. I lost these things on the 26th of February, out of my box, which was in the loft, at Mr. Woodwards, where I live; it was about seven o'clock - I was feeding a team of horses at the door, and heard a noise in the left; I went and looked up, and saw the prisoner coming down; I asked what he did there, he said he went there to lay down - I asked what he had got under his frock; he said, his shirt - I took it out, and it was this property of mine; he was a stranger - he struggled, but I called for help, and he was secured.

Prisoner's Defence. I had come out of the country; a man stood by the horse-trough - I asked him where I could lay down, as I was in distress; he took me up to the loft, gave me the things out of the box, and said if I took them to Hounslow, they would tell me where to find him - and he would give me 1s.

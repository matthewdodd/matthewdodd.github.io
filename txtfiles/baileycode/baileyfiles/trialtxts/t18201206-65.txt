            . I am servant to Mr. Brien, who is a surgeon
, and lives in Spencer-street, Northampton-square


. On the 11th of November I was coming up the kitchen stairs and saw the prisoner going out of the house from the parlour - I looked into the parlour, missed the spoons, and ran out - I got Jones, who took him, and brought him back. I had seen the spoons in the parlour not ten minutes before. I ran after another man who got away.

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Goswell-street. Greening came into the shop and asked my master to let me run after the prisoner. I ran out, saw him a good way off - he pointed him out - I secured him, and another man went away - the prisoner gave me four spoons which I gave to Mr. Brien. I had pursued him near a mile.

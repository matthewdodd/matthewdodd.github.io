 was again indicted

22nd of August, 2 handkerchiefs, value 10s., the goods of

JOHN FARMER
. I am a patrol of Farringdon-Within. On the evening of the 22nd of August I had the prisoner in charge on the last case—I searched him, and he took out from between his waistcoat and shirt two silk handkerchiefs, which I produce—I asked him where he got them from—he said he had bought them—in searching further I found another handkerchief stuffed down the knee of his trowsers—he had another handkerchief in his hand, with a waistcoat and two pieces of cloth in it; and also a paper parcel, with a silk handkerchief and two pair of stockings, which he said he bought at a shop lower down—I saw the name of Harvey on the paper, and went there.





CHARLES MILLER
. I am in the employ of John Harvey and Son. I recollect the prisoner coming to the shop on the 22nd of August—I showed him some silk handkerchiefs—he was in company with another man—he bought one handkerchief and a pair of stockings, and then went away—they did not but these handkerchiefs—they have our mark on them, and are the same I showed them.

Cross-examined. Q. Has Mr. Harvey any other Christian name? A. No—the things the prisoner bought are in the paper.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the articles at the west end of the town.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

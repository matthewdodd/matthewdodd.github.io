James Patman, and stealing 6 night-shirts, 17 handkerchiefs, 3 petticoats, and other articles, value 8l.; his goods.






FANNY PATMAN
. I am the wife of James Patman, of 43, Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; he was master of the house, but we have since removed. On 13th Jan., I was alone in the house, about 8 o'clock—there were then twelve towels, seventeen handkerchiefs, some petticoats, and other articles, safe in the kitchen—I went to bed at a quarter to ten, leaving the doors and windows fastened—I got up next morning about eight, missed the linen, and found a quantity of matches on the hearth—I went up-stairs, and found the front window half open—I know this shirt and pair of socks (produced)—they were in my care, to wash.





THOMAS ROBERTS
 (policeman, M 28). On 16th Jan. I took the prisoner on another charge—he was wearing this shirt; I spoke to him about it—he said his sister made it a long time before—these socks were in a tobacco-box in his pocket—he said he bought them two or three days before—I also found this whistle on him; a knife was found on one of his four companions, and he said that if he had known it had come to this, he would have put it into my guts.


Prisoner's Defence. I bought the shirt and socks in Petticoat-lane of a man with a bundle.




GUILTY
. * Aged 22.—


transported for Seven Years.

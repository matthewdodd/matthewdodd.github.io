             sworn.
I am a waterman, on the 29th of March, I was going over the water with a fare, and I saw this man laying under the ship's bows cutting a rope away, in this boat and pulling along-side of him, they shoved away, there was a waterman in the boat with the prisoner; the rope was hanging along-side the cable; I put the man out of my boat into the ship's boat, and pulled after these men, I came along-side of them, and talked ten minutes, the waterman had the sculls; after that this prisoner got up, and took hold of one of the sculls, and pulled away from me; at Ratcliffe-cross they pulled the boat ashore, and they both jumped out and ran away; I ran after the prisoner, and stopt him; I am sure the prisoner was one of the men in the boat.

I had the watch on the 29th, and seeing two men run, I ran after them; I heard the cry of stop thief! and immediately pursued them, and caught this man; I did not see him come out of the boat; he was running when I stopt him.

BOWEN DUNN MEREDITH. I am a grocer
, and live in Whitechapel


. On the afternoon of the 15th of December, I was standing about six yards inside my shop - the prisoner came in, and took a bag of coffee; I pursued him, but he carried it so dexterously that I could not discover he had it till I came up to him; I then collared him - he dropped the bag; it was picked up, and carried into a shop - I was surrounded by several more of his gang, who endeavoured to rescue him - this is the bag and coffee.

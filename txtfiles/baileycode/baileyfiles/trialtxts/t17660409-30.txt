            . I stopt the prisoner at half an hour after 2 o'clock, or thereabouts, in the Fleet-market, and took him to the watch-house; he had 2 brass wheels about him: he put them down under the bench, and said, What have you to do with me now? I asked him where he brought them wheels from. First he said, he brought them from Aldersgate-street; after that, he said he had them from Wapping; and at last he acknowledged where he took them, and said he was in liquor.

            , the watchman, brought the prisoner to the watch-house, about a quarter before 3; he had in his possession this brass wheel, and 2 iron ones. I took him before the Alderman, who ordered me to advertise it, as he could give no account of himself; and the people came and owned it.
Prisoner's defence.
The man stopt me at Holborn-bridge; I picked up the wheel in the street.

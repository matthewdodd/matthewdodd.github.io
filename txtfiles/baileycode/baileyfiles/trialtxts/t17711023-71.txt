            . I live in Brook's market


. On the 3d of October I was removing to Lambeth; when I returned, about six o'clock, my wife had taken up the prisoner, and had her to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding

                   Harris
               



            . Whilst my husband was gone to Lambeth, I heard a bustle in the street; presently the mob brought the prisoner back to my house; she had these things in her apron (producing them.) They are my property; I had them in my hand about an hour before; they were wore by my apprentice; she acknowledged before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             that she went up stairs, and took them.


                  Elizabeth
                   Taylor
               



            . I am apprentice to Mr. Harris; I saw the prisoner going from my master's door with something in her lap; I suspected her; I cried out, Stop thief; she ran, the mob stopt her, and brought her back; I saw my mistress take the things out of her apron.
"The prisoner, in her defence, said the girl gave them to her; she called two witnesses who gave her a good character."

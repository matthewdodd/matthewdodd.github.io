            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Holywell-street, Strand


. About one o'clock on the 3rd of April, the prisoner came and said, "I want a pair shoes;" he took a pair off the hooks, and said, "These are about my size, but I can't have them now, I am going to Charing-cross;" I turned my back, and he walked out of the shop - I missed these shoes, and pursued him; he had got half way down the street - I went and said, "You scoundrel, you have a pair of shoes of mine;" I brought him back; he threw down the shoes, gave me a blow, knocked me down, and ran off - I pursued; a Thames Police-officer was coming up, and stopped him - he gave him a blow, but the officer got up and took him; he was quite sober.
Prisoner. Q. Did not I give you the shoes back again? A. When I brought you back, you threw them down and struck me over the head - you said you were in the army, and was going to Cox and Greenwood's.

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner running down Arundel-street; I caught him - he hit me in the eye, and made it bleed; I lost my hold of him, but I got him again and kept him.
Prisoner. I was twenty-five years in the army, and a serjeant nineteen; I have been handsomely remunerated; it is not likely I should compromise a 35l. a year salary to get 6s.

               Transported for Seven Years

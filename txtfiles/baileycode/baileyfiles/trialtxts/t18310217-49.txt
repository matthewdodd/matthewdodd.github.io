            . I am shopman to Mr. John Dent, a linen-draper
. On the 26th of January, about half-past eight o'clock. I saw the prisoner going out of the shop with this cloak, which had been about two yards within the door - I did not see him come in; I followed him about two hundred yards, and stopped him with it; I said he must come back with me - he said he could not; I took him back to the shop - this is the cloak; it is my master's.

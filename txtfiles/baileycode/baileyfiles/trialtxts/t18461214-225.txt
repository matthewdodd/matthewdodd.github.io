Ebenezer Howard.






WILLIAM JOSEPH DARLING
. I am shopman to Ebenezer Howard, a poulterer, in Leadenhall-market. On the 5th of Dec., about half-past eight o'clock, I watched the prisoner—he had the basket, which the policeman has now, hanging on his shoulder—he looked through our shop, and drew four fowls off the board—he put them into the basket, put it on his shoulder, and walked away.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Were you not attending to a customer? A. I was, and said to the customer, "Did you see that man?"—I swear I saw him take the fowls, and put them into his basket—he had a hat on, and a velvet coat—he did not say that he did not put them into his basket, but they were in it—he said before the Lord Mayor that he went into the shop to inquire the price of fowls of Mr. Howard, and when he came out these fowls were in his basket—I am quite sure I am not mistaken in the prisoner—I had seen him two hours before, and watched him—at the time he took them he looked through the shop, and up the stall—I saw his features as plainly as I can see you.




GUILTY
.*† Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

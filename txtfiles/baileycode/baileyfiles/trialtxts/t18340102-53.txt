            . I live at No. 35, North Bank, Regent's Park


, in the parish of St. Marylebone - last Wednesday, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by a noise - I got up and went to the bed-room door, where I found a pair of men's shoes outside the door, and at the door of the next room, which is my dressing room, I found a large clothes-bag, filled with a variety of clothes taken from the wardrobe - I immediately rang the bell to call up my servant from below - a female servant at the same time came out of the bed-room adjoining - I rang the bell for my man-servant - he came from the room below, undressed - I told him I had heard the noise, and suspected somebody was in the house; I desired him to slip something on and make a search; a very short time elapsed before we had both clothed ourselves, and were in the course of proceeding to examine the house, when we heard the outer bell ring, and the noise of persons endeavouring to alarm us; it proved to be the policemen - we then went down below into the kitchen, and found the door open which leads into the yard, and from thence into the front garden, and to the garden-gate - by the timewe had got through the yard, and ascended the steps, we found five or six policemen having the prisoner in charge - I immediately recognised him to be a servant whom I had discharged nine or ten months ago - I asked the policemen if he was without shoes, and he was so; I said, I had his shoes up stairs, which I should take the liberty of detaining for the present - the policeman produced five silk pocket handkerchiefs, which I recognised to be my property - I spoke to the prisoner to recognise him, and asked him if there were any other parties concerned - he replied, in a tone of insolent bravado, "Oh, yes, there are three or four more round the corner;" - I requested the policemen to take him to their station-house, requesting two to remain with me for the purpose of searching the premises; I discovered no signs of depredation whatever - it appeared on examination that the only mode by which he could have effected an entrance was by a grating over the coal-hole, which had been accidentally left unlocked, and there were evident marks among the coals of a man having scrambled down them - the only other circumstance I noticed was a large piece of meat between two pieces of bread, wrapped up in a piece of paper, which had been cut from a joint in the larder - I discovered that my watch and purse, ring and key, and snuff-box, seal, and pocket-book were missing from the top of a chest of drawers in front of my bed in the room I slept in - on the following morning I attended the police-office, and preferred a charge against the man, and described the property - I had placed the articles on my drawers when I went to bed - my bed-room door was not locked, it is possible it might have been a-jar - the clothes-bag was examined the following morning by the servant who took the things out, and placed them in the wardrobe - I did not see that done - when I saw the bag I put my hand into it, and felt a coat and a velvet waistcoat, and other things in it - and I can swear they were all in the wardrobe the night before - when I got up, on hearing the noise, I think my bed-room door was open - the grating is a small semi-circular grating, opening over the coalhole - it is generally fastened by a spike inside, and as there was no appearance of force on it - I suppose it was not fastened that night - the grating is of itself a sufficient weight to be kept down - I had not noticed it the night before at all - the value of the watch is 10l. or 12l. - the chain 2l. or 3l. The things all together were above the value of 5l. certainly; there were two £5 notes in the purse, besides other things.
Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q.Are you a military man or a naval officer? A. A military man, belonging to the East India Company's service - I am married - Mrs. Grindlay was at this time indisposed, and I slept in a spare bed-room - nobody slept in it besides myself - there are two bed-rooms adjoining my room - I have three female servants - the female servant came from the room immediately adjoining.
Q. Is there a door besides the outer door between your room and your servant's room? A. No; as far as I can describe to you, there is only one door to each room, and they are close together, so that persons cannot come out of both doors together without coming in contact with each other - there is only one door to each room - they open close together - the female servant came out of the door immediately next to mine - her name is 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Sherold
               



            , or something like it - I have a female-servant named Kellet- she sleeps in the same room with Sherold and the housekeeper, three of them together - Kellet was in my service at the time the prisoner was - I am not aware that the prisoner was courting Kellet - I know nothing of it one way or the other - my room was not fastened - I don't think even the latch had caught - any servant in the house had access to my room at any time, by day or night.
Q.What did you mean by asking the prisoner if any persons were concerned? A.Because I wished to know if there were others, that we might look sharp after them - I rather addressed the question generally to the prisoner, and to the police I said, "Are there any more? let us look round" - I did not expect to get any answer from the prisoner - I certainly did not allude to any persons in my own house - I did not suspect any of my establishment - When the prisoner left me, he requested I would give him a good character - I discharged him with great reluctance, because I found he had acquired a habit of drinking, which all my endeavours to prevent were fruitless - I found him so excellent a servant in other respects, I wished not to part with him - I gave him three or four warnings, and he promised to give up that habit; but he did not, and I discharged him- I don't think he has been in service since - I have given him a character two or three times, but I believe he has not been in service.
Q.Have you given him a good character? A. Whatever questions a person puts to me, I answer sincerely, in the presence of the servant, that he may not fancy I have said anything against him without foundation - about three months ago he requested me to give him a character - I said yes, but I insisted on the prisoner remaining in the room at the time - which might be thought extraordinary, but I was determined to abide by it.
RICHMOND MOORE. I am a policeman - about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning of the 1st of January, I was walking down North-bank, Regent's-park, on duty - my attention was attracted by a noise which I heard on Captain 
               Grindlay
            's premises; and, while I hesitated whether I should go and see what was the matter, the prisoner made his appearance out of the front gate without his shoes, attempting to make his escape; on which I ran in front of him, and asked him who he was - he told me he was Captain 
               Grindlay
            's servant; on which he said, "I dare say you know me well enough" - I told him, I had no right to know any man coming out of a gentleman's house at that hour in the morning - upon putting his hand into his pocket, he said "Here, take this - it is Christmas time; the Captain won't let me go out in the day, and I am going out for a lark" - I told him unless he would go back with me to Captain Grindlay, and be recognised as being his servant, and he sanctioned his going out at that hour in the morning, I should take him as a prisoner - he then said, putting his hand out again, "Here is plenty to make it all right; and you are a d-d fool if you don't take it" - with that attempting to speak to me, he, at the same time, gave me a blow on my head, he put his foot out and threw me over on the ground, on my right shoulder - by the time I got up he was ten or fifteen yards in front of me, making his escape - I saw him throwing something from his pocket,as I supposed, a pocket-handkerchief - he dropped five successively, and told me to stop and pick them up - upon which I got very near to him, and told him I should not be bought with silk handkerchiefs, and that I would not be bribed by any man, for I was determined to do my duty; and told him if he did not surrender I would strike him on the head - he did not seem willing to surrender, and I struck him three blows on the arm with my staff; but, being injured a little by the fall, the blows made no impression on him; on which he closed in on me and we both fell to the ground - I held him as long as I could; but in a short time he made his escape a second time; and by the time I got up he might be twenty yards distant, but still in sight - on which I hallooed, "Stop thief;" and my brother constable, 
               
                  John 
                  Hull
               



            , stopped him in my sight, twenty or thirty yards further on - I took him back to Captain 
               Grindlay
            's, and as I went back I picked up the five handkerchiefs in the same place where I saw him throw them - he was searched at the station-house, and a gold watch, a guard-chain, a seal, a purse with two £5 bank notes and the two sovereigns and a half, a snuff-box, a ring (which Captain 
               Grindlay
             has now on his finger), and two pocket books, and other things were found on him - he had no shoes on - he walked down to the office in the shoes Captain 
               Grindlay
             produced; and then we took them off him - they fit him - the notes were in the purse.


                  JOHN 
                  HULL
               



            . I am a policeman - I stopped the prisoner.
CAPTAIN GRINDLAY re-examined. I have the ring on my finger - it is mine - this is my watch - these are two £5 notes, which I believe to be the same I received at Coutts' the same morning, but I have not the numbers; but they were in my own purse - this pencil-case belongs to a memorandum-book which was returned to me before the magistrate - these are my handkerchiefs - the two sovereigns and a half were in the purse with the notes.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not break into the house, nor steal the articles named in the indictment - the articles were given to me by a person in the house - I had been out with a person living in the house for two or three hours in the evening, and I went outside at eleven o'clock, and when part of the servants were gone to bed, I returned, and one person came down and let me in, a person who I believe my counsel has named to Captain 
               Grindlay
            , which Captain 
               Grindlay
             very well knows was a sweetheart of mine from his own words in conversation between them. I believe it is fruitless to say any thing more, but that I leave it to your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury. Several gentlemen I have lived with, had I time to have let them know, could have given me a character, but the time has been so short nobody but the servants know I am here - I was only committed on the 1st of January.

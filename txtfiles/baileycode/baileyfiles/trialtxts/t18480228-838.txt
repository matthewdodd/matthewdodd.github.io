, stealing 1 ham, value 8s.; 1 pair of boots, and 1 pair of slippers, 7s.; the goods of 



John Sellers; having been previously convicted.






WILLIAM WILLIAMS
 (policeman, D 141.) On 18th Feb., I was on duty in Sale-street, Paddington, about a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning and saw the prisoner standing behind a cab that was passing me, with three parcels on the roof—I saw him reach off this parcel, then jump down, and run along Cambridge-street with it—I called, "Stop thief!"—he dropped the parcel and ran into the Edgware-road—I took him—he said, "I am a

respectable man, I know nothing about it"—I had asked if he knew anything of the parcel he had dropped—I never lost sight of him.





JOHN SELLERS.
 I am a brewer, at Lyme Regis. I and my wife came up by the mail-train to the Paddington-station, and were inside the cab, going as witnesses to the House of Commons—this basket was on the top of the cab—it had a ham in it, a pair of lady's boots, and a pair of gentleman's slippers—I missed it—this is it, and its contents are mine.





SAMUEL MOYES
 (policeman, D 45.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Jan. 1847, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

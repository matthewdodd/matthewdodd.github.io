            . On the 18th of September, the prisoner came in, and he asked me to look at some pocket hankerchiefs. I asked him silk or cotten, and he said silk, I took a bundle out of the window, and put them before him. He then asked me if I had any with a white spot. I turned round to look in the window, and a piece out of that description. A gentleman came in to buy some articles, and he made a full stop, and accused the prisoner of taking a piece of handkerchief. The prisoner seemed very much confused, and denied it, and tried to be seated, and turned his pockets out. I also contradicted the gentleman; however we unbuttoned the flap of the prisoner's small clothes, and pulled the said handkerchiefs out. He begged very hard to be let go, but I told him I could do nothing of the kind. I was persuaded that he was an odd hand by the wayhe did it. In the mean time, the gentleman who detected him, prevailed on Mrs. Wilson to let him go.

He had two indictments against him in the name of 
               
                  David 
                  Roberts 
               



            , in May Sessions, 1767, and was capitally convicted on one of them. He received his Majesty's pardon the June Sessions following, on condition of being transported for fourteen years (See No. 204, in Mr. Alderman Kite's Mayoralty.)


                  Mary 
                  Coleman 
               



            . I live in St. Martin's-Lane. I am servant to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Wainwright 
               



            , a carpenter. I lost all the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them by name.) They were in four boxes, in a garret, in my master's house: they were taken away last St. Thomas-day, between the hours of twelve and four in the daytime. They were found where 
               
                  David 
                  Roberts 
               



             lodged.


                  John 
                  Conyer 
               



            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Gunston, a pawnbroker, in German-Street; this apron (producing one) was pledged to me by 
               
                  Frances 
                  Newcomb 
               



            , on Friday the 27th of September.
M. Coleman. This is my property, which I lost with the other things.
Conyer. Mrs. Coleman came and enquired what things 
               
                  Frances 
                  Newcomb 
               



             had pledged, and I produced that.


                  Margaret 
                  Tipton 
               



            . I received some linen of Robert-Davis to cut into shirts the day before he was taken, I think it was the Wednesday night before Christmas day. The piece ran eighteen ells, for I measured it.
M. Coleman. I bought twenty-five yards: I think I had cut off a yard and three quarters.
M. Tipton. The day the search-warrant came into the house, the prisoner, Newcomb, came in a hurry and took the cloth from me. This was the Thursday or Friday in the Christmas week. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Coleman 
               



             was there. My apartment is at the bottom of the yard belonging to the same house: when Newcomb came for it, she told me there was a search-warrant come. I desired her to let the cloth lie. She put them in her apron and carried it down stairs. I had cut some out after that. She brought it up again, and soon fetched it a second time; but I never saw the cloth afterwards.
Q. Do you know whether Davis and Newcomb were acquainted?
M. Tipton. That I do not know. I know they both lodged in the same house, at Kensington.


                  William 
                  Shaw 
               



            . I live at Kensington. I heard some of Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's constables were come where Davis lodged. I went there after they were gone. I went to 
               
                  Fanny 
                  Newcomb 
               



            . I found this cloth down in the necessary-house, (produced in court, deposed to by prosecutor) by a place on it where she had cut a small piece off at one end.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had the misfortune to lodge in the house where Davis lodged. He was quite a stranger to me. I go out to washing and ironing. I was not at home when these things were brought in. The apron he gave me in some linen which I washed for him. They were brought in on the Wednesday night. What I had were delivered back again. The landlady of the house desired I would take them away: she likewise desired I would get the shirts and throw them out on the dunghill, or any where I could. I took the clothes and went into the necessary house, and, by accident, I let it fall in.

            . The prisoner was servant in my house near a year and a half ago, in Tyburn-road. She always behaved just and honest while in my house.

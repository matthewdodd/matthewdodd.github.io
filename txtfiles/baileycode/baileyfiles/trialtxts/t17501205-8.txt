            . I was at Billingsgate




, Nov. 23, about 6 o'clock in the morning; I had a linen handkerchief taken out of my pocket; about 5 minutes after I miss'd it I heard the cry, pickpocket; I went to the George, where the prisoner Leeman was taken to; there the constable pull'd out some handkerchiefs from his pocket, one of them was mine.

            . I was coming down Billingsgate market the time I heard the cry, pickpocket; I took hold of Leeman by the collar, some of the people cry'd duck him ; his apron was tied about him, I took two Dabbs from him, said I, as he has these fish, he is likely to have something else; so we brought him to the

             ; he was very rustical, I had not time to take out my staff to shew my authority for some time; I thought he would have got away; I search'd him, and took out two handkerchiefs, and found a third on the ground, near his feet; the first I held up, it was a silk one, was own'd by

            : the second I held up, it was a linen one, was own'd by the prosecutor; I had observ'd his hand under the table, I saw a third lying under the table, I took up that, and it was own'd by

            . Then they brought in Kingston ; when they were standing together, Kingston stood before Leeman; I saw Leeman's hand under the other's great coat, I mistrusted he was going to give him something; a young man perceiv'd a pistol in his hand, we took it from him; he swore, and d - d our eyes, and ask'd, what we wanted with him.

            . I was that same morning at the market about 6 o'clock, and had bought some shads, and we were dividing them; the man that was with me said, he had lost his handkerchief, at that time my handkerchief was in my pocket. I saw the two prisoner's standing together ; going by Kingston he directly turn'd upon me, and I felt him pick my pocket; I felt his hand in my pocket, and miss'd my handkerchief directly; I saw him go to the other prisoner, and give him a handkerchief, whether it was mine or not I will not swear; the other was about four yards from me, when he pick'd my pocket; then I went past him and happen'd to meet a fishmonger; said I, such a one has lost his handkerchief, and I have lost mine, and that man has taken mine, and given it to that other man. We secured them as beforemention'd.

            . I am servant to Mrs. Dalton. she keeps a shop in Aldgate-street


; on the 4th of August one of the servant-maids found a paper bag of Scotch snuff, of between two and three pounds, in a place that I was sensible was intended to be carried away; she brought it to me, then I insisted upon having all their keys to search, as all denied it; as I was searching one box, I observed the prisoner (who was one of the servants) take something out of his box; I laid hold of him, and found it was a pound of snuff, which he acknowledged he took, and said he intended to make a present of it; he owned it was my mistress's property, and begged pardon; then I sent for my mistress's brother-in-law; after which the prisoner confessed he had concealed the paper bag of snuff, with intent to take away; then he confessed he had taken snuff and tobacco.
Q. Was any thing said to him to induce him to confess?
Rayner. He was desired to tell what else he had done, which would be the only way to save himself; he confessed he had concealed a bag of tobacco in the stable; we went there and found a box and a bag, with each tobacco in them; the box weighed nine pounds, and the bag seventy-four pounds.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the affair.

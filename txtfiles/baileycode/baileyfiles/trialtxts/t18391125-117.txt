MART ANN ROWLAND
. I am the daughter of William Rowland, who keeps a grinder's shop in Cross-street, Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the morning of the 13th of November, I was in a room adjoining the shop—I heard a chinking of money, and went into the shop directly—I saw the prisoner coming from behind the counter, I caught hold of him, and asked what business he had there—I do not recollect that he made any answerhe got from me by struggling—I followed him outside the shop, and caught him again—there was another boy outside, to whom he attempted to give what be had got in his hand, but I was too close to allow of that—I laid hold of the prisoner, and he dropped four shillings—a little girl who was going by picked them up, and gave them to me—I took the prisoner in, and gave him into custody—I noticedthat the till was drawn out, and the prisoner came from the end of the counter, where the till was—I thought there had been about 6s. 6d. in it—I gave the four shillings to my father, who gave them to the officer.





RICHARD BAKER
 (police-constable H 31.) I was called, and took the prisoner—I received the four shillings from the prosecutor—I found nothing on the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my dinner—this witness ran out of the shop, and caught me—I had not been inside.





MART ANN ROWLAND

re-examined. There was another boy, bigger than the prisoner, outside—I am certain it was the prisoner who was in the shop, and whom I took hold of, and who dropped the money—I caught him again before he had got off the step.

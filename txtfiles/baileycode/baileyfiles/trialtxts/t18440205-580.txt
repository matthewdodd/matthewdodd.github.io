ROSINA JOHNSTON
. I am the prisoner's wife; he is a mason; previous to the 24th of Dec. we had been living apart for fifteen weeks. On Sunday, the 24th of Dec., he came to my lodgings between five and six o'clock in the morning, but I did not see him—I went in the middle of the day to Mr. Miller's, No. 18, King-street—Mrs. Miller had sent for me—when I got there he was in the house, but I did not see him then—he afterwards came into the room, and asked me how I did—I said I was pretty well—he asked how the

child was—I said, "Quite well"—we have had one child—I wished to leave the room, but he would not allow me—I told him I had some work to get ready for a customer—he said he did not care for customers; he would not allow me to leave the room—the work was for a person who was going out to tea—I told him I wished to go home to get it ready—he said I should not—Mrs. Miller said she would give me needle and thread if I would do it there—she did so—he took the band-box from me, with the work in it—I asked him to give it me back—he said he would not let me have it, except he got to my lodgings—I asked Mrs. Miller for a pair of scissors to cut the trimming of a cap—the prisoner took a pair of scissors from his pocket, and said he had brought them back to do my work—he had taken those scissors away better than a twelvemonth before—I said I did not wish to see them, Mrs. Miller had lent me a pair—he then put them into his pocket—Mr. Miller was in and out of the room, and Mrs. Miller was there all the time—the prisoner wanted me to take him to my lodgings—I said, as I had been before a Magistrate, and been honourably separated from him, I did not wish him to come—he went into the hall, and had my band-box, with the work in it, in his hand—I did not feel inclined to go—Mr. Miller came and wished me to go—the prisoner asked me to go into the back room, and talk with him—I did not wish—Mr. Miller came to me, and asked me to go again—I asked him to go and talk to him; and while he was talking, I got out of the house without him—the lady had sent her servant for the work—I was going back to Mr. Miller, to get him to get the work from him, but I saw him with the band-box—he came out with Mr. Miller—I let him go up the street, then went and asked him for the work—he said I should not have it—I took hold of the band-box, pulled it from him, and ran from him—he came into the street, to strike me—I asked him the meaning of this foolish behaviour, and what he wanted—he said he wanted to go to my lodgings, he wanted to see his child—I told him to go and sit down till I had delivered my work, and he could either go home and see the child, or I would bring it to him—he asked how long I should be—v said it might be half an hour, or better; I would come as soon as possible—he said he would go into a public-house at the corner of the street where I live—he said, if I would not come to him, he would buy pistols, and blow our brains out—I left, and came as soon as possible to the place, which was the Magpie and Stump—I found him sitting there with Mr. Miller—he said v had been to let some person know he was coming—a quartern of rum was called for—he desired me to pay for it, which I did—they had been drinking before v went in—I had a little of the rum—the landlord cleared the house, as it was time for afternoon service at Church—the prisoner told me to lead the way—he wanted me to take him to my lodgings—I said, "Very good, you can come, so that you come quietly"—Mr. Miller wished to go home, but he insisted on his coming with him to see his child—we got to the lodgings—I went in first, and when I got up stairs, my landlady and the old lady who kept my child were sitting at tea—he came up immediately after, and called to Mr. Miller to follow him—on coming into the room he struck at Mr. Miller—he called to Mr. Miller in a very rude way, and asked what brought him there—Miller 'said he came at his invitation—he then turned and struck me, knocked me off the chair, and then turned to strike Miller again—Miller said he did not wish to interfere with him and his wife, and left the room—he said, "Mr. Miller, you have been a fancy man of my wife's," when he struck him—Miller's nose was bleeding, and he went away, saying he did not want to interfere—only me and the prisoner were in the room then, and he locked the door—v wished to pacify him—he said, "Sit still, you shall never rise more"—he had struck me twice,

and at the third blow I became insensible—he had struck me on the temple—I felt the blood spring from my head through my right ear—when I recovered he had got me on the other side of the room—he had dragged me from one side to the other, and was jumping on my breast with his feet, and beating me on the head occasionally—he said he had come to do for me—he gave no reason for this, except saying Miller was my fancy man—I was too much beaten to recollect what he might say, but I recollect his coming forward with a pair of scissors—I put up my hand, and the scissors cut my finger, and went through my lip—I became insensible; and when I came to myself, the floor was covered with blood—my head smarted very much; I felt it bleeding very much, and became quite blind—he shook me, and told me to look up—he said, You are not dead yet"—some time afterwards he called me an ugly name, and said, "Look up, here is your child"—I said, I could not see my child—he said, "You shall never see it more till you are in hell; I could finish you with one stroke, but it would be too much mercy for you"—he said, "I have a deadlier stroke for your heart yet; if your much beloved son was here, you should hear his cries while I thrust his heart, and you could not help him"—he went and opened the door, and listened, and seemed to stand in an attitude—I could not see him, but heard him unlock the door, and he seemed as if listening—some period afterwards I heard voices coming up stairs—the officers then came—I went to the hospital, and was there twelve days or a fortnight—my head is still in a great deal of pain.

Cross-examined by
MR. COBBETT. He was at your lodgings between five and six o'clock in the morning? A. He was there better than an hour, but I told my landlady not to let him in—they did not let him in till I had got over the paling into the other yard with my baby—the next time I saw him was at Miller's, between twelve and one—I think he had been there better than an hour—he did not offer me the scissors, but asked if I knew them—he had been drinking, but did not look tipsy—I am confident he used the words I have stated—he has never accused me to my face with going with other men, but behind my back he has scandalised me very much—v heard so from several people—he never had any occasion—I never said anything to him about it—as he was very passionate I thought it better not—I have told him he was very foolish, but he always denied saying anything of the kind—he said not to mind his way, because I was aware he only said it in a passion.

COURT. Q. When did you go to the London Hospital? A. On the Tuesday—a medical gentleman attended me till then, and dressed my wounds.





CATHERINE WEST
. I am a widow, and wjis living in the same room with the prosecutrix, and was in the habit of minding her child—v did not hear the prisoner say why he beat his wife—he came on the morning of the 24th, and knocked at the door—Mrs. Ford answered him, "Who is there?"—he said, "Johnston"—she came up stairs to tell Mrs. Johnston, and asked what she was to do—he went away without seeing her—I saw no more of him till about five minutes to three o'clock in the afternoon—Mrs. Johnston came up first and Mr. Johnston afterwards—on the stairs I heard him say to Mr. Miller, "Come on"—he came into the room and Miller stood against the door—the prisoner came in and put his arm round his wife's neck—he then turned to Mr. Miller and asked what he did there—Miller said, "I should not have come only you asked me, to make things comfortable between you, and now I shall go, you seem as if you were likely to be comfortable"—the prisoner turned round, looked at him, and said, "You have no business here," and he struck him—he then turned round to his wife and struck her, then turned to Miller again and struck him and caused his nose to bleed—I heard nothing said

about a fancy man, or why he struck Miller—he then turned and repeated the blows to his wife, and said, "I will do for you"—I was in the room all this time—I begged of the prisoner to govern his passion—he said he wanted to see his child—I went down stairs to fetch the child, and as I came up he aimed a blow, but I am not able to say whether he meant it for me or the child—he did not strike either of us—he struck against the door—I went down to speak to Mrs. Todd—Miller had gone down after he had the second blow—I told him he had better go down—when I came up again I found the door locked—I knocked, and the prisoner opened it—I took the key out of the door and put it into my pocket—I saw a great deal of blood about the room—his wife was removed from where be first knocked her down, up to the opposite corner under the clock—she was sitting on the floor with her bands extended on the ground supporting herself, bleeding furiously, and holding her head down—I went for a constable—I could not get one at first, and went to Denmark-treet—the prisoners had been drinking, but was not quite tipsy—I think be knew perfectly well what he was doing—v did not hear him say anything about a man being in bed with his wife till the police came—when v remonstrated with him and held his bands, he said if I did not leave the room be would serve me the same.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you go down for the child as soon as he asked for it? A. Yes—that was after he had knocked his wife down, and while she was on the floor—I went down and returned immediately with the child—he was very violent—when he aimed the blow I stooped, and be hit the door—he was striking every thing, he appeared in a mad state—is ten months old.





WILLIAM MILLER
, cabinet maker. No. 18, Lower King-street, Commercial-road, About ten or eleven o'clock on the 24th Dec. I saw the prisoner, and went to the Magpie public-house with him—I fell in with him again, and he persuaded me to come with him—we had some liquor at the Magpie—his wife was with us then—she met him as she bad promised—she was not with us at first—I think we had about three quarterns of rum between us three, what he had before I do not know—we had had about half a pint of rum at my bouse between five or six of us—after we came out of the public-bouse, he persuaded me to stop a few minutes longer with them as I had been so kind to them—I said I would go as far as the door—he begged me to come up with them—I said no, I had had enough of their family affairs—he went up, and I staid there for a few minutes to see how they got on up stairs—hearing all was not quiet, I went up and said, "Halloo, Mr. Johnston, I thought you were all comfortable up here"—as soon as I said that be gave me a blow on the nose, and made another hit that I did not get—he made use of a very bad expression, and said, "Go out of my room"—he did not say why he struck me—he behaved very well all the time he was with me—I did not hear him say anything about fancy man—as soon as got the blow I was struck-like, I did not know what it was or what to think of it, and left the room to wash my nose.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say he struck you the moment you got up stairs? A. Yes—as soon as I got within the door—I was half in the room and half out—I do not think I had stood there a moment—I went up because all was not quiet, and the landlady told me to go up—I did not say when I got up stairs, "Seeing you are pretty comfortable, I shall go," that was at the street door—he never accused me of being his wife's fancy man that I know of—v never heard him.





GEORGE SEAMAN
 (police-constable H 150.) On the 24th of Dec., about four or five o'clock, v saw Catherine West—in consequence of which I apprehended

the prisoner—I saw his wife lying on the floor—there was a great quantity of blood on the floor—she was bleeding from the head, nose, mouth, and ear—the prisoner was sitting on a chair—I saw something bright in his hand which Iconsidered at the moment was a knife—I asked him what he had done with that knife—he said he had no knife—I senrched about, but could find no knife or any implement like one—I told him he must consider himself my prisoner, and come with me to the station—he asked me to wait a few minutes, for his wife would forgive him for what he had done—he was the worse for drink in my opinion, but was quite sensible of what he was doing—on the way to the station he said he had found a lump of an Irishman about six foot high with his wife when he entered the room, in the very act of committing adultery, and he asked me if I would not do the same as he had done if I found the same when I went home—he said he had given the man a d—d good slap at the side of the head and kicked his * * * down stairs—in searching him at the station in the morning I found on him this pair of scissors and a sixpence—his shoes were all clotted with blood, and the fore part of the legs of his trowsers, about three inches high, were all wet and clotted with blood.





CHARLES THOMAS BLACKMAN
. I am a medical student and house-surgeon at the London Hospital. On the 26th of Dec. I admitted the prosecutrix into the hospital—I found two wounds on the head, one on the upper lip, and another on the hand between the two middle fingers—her head, face, neck, and upper part of her chest were covered with contusions—she was in a very weak state, and there was great difficulty of breathing—she was sent to bed—all the wounds were incised wounds, and were very likely to have been inflicted with such an instrument as these scissors—she was released as an inpatient in about a fortnight.

Cross-examined. Q. You found no wound on one of the fingers? A. No, it was between the fingers, on the hand.
Ann Connibear, College-street, Westminster; Ann Ladd, No. 69, Orchard-street; Elizabeth Harris, William Harris, Hannah Kitchen, and Alexander Gibson, deposed to the prisoner's good character.

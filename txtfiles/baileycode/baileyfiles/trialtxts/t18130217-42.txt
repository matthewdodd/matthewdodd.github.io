            . I am shopman to 
               
                  John 
                  Harris
               



            , linen-draper
, in the Strand, in the parish of St. Clements Danes


. On the 25th of January, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hines
               



             came into the shop, about six o'clock in the evening; she asked to look at some printed cottons. I shewed her some. She bought three yards, which, came to four shillings and sixpence. She gave me two three-shilling pieces to give change for them. I turned round and was the other woman push something up her petticoats. I immediately accused Hines of stealing some property of 
               
                  John 
                  Harris
               



            's. Hines immediately let the print drop. This is the cotton: it was folded up. There were about forty prints folded up on the counter. It has our shop mark upon it.
Q. How long before had you seen it, before they came in - A. I had seen it in the course of the day. Upon her letting it drop I sent for an officer. Then there was a lad at that time serving 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Smith
               



            . 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Smith
               



             stepped forward and held me by the arms, and said she knew 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hines
               



            . She held me by the arms, so that 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hines
               



             might make her escape. I held both of them fast, so that neither of them could go until the officer came.
Hines's Defence. There were things on the floor and on the counter. I am quite innocent. I went into the shop to buy three yards of cotton, which I wanted for a bed-gown.
Smith's Defence. I hope you will shew mercy upon me, for God's sake.

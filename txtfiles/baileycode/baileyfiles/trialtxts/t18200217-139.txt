            . I live at Hanwell. On the 6th of January I stopped with my horse at the Red Lion, at Acton


, about ten o'clock in the evening; my horse stood at the door - when I came out the saddle was gone. Williamson brought it to my house about a fortnight after.

            . I am a horse-dealer, and live at Brentford. I bought the saddle of Hutton, about the middle of January, for 15 s. - I knew him before. He said he had taken it for an old debt for tares. I did not ask him who he had it from. I saw Narroway in his company afterwards.

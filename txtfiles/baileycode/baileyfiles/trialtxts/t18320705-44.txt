             (Police-constable D 102). On the 28th of May I was passing through Portman-square, and saw the prisoner open an area gate, go down, and come up again; I followed him, he ran through several streets, and then into a public-house - I went in, and took him as he was going out at the back door; I asked what he had about him - he said he did not know; I said, "I will see"- I took him back to the area, and saw Janson coming out of the area - I asked if he had lost any thing; he said he did not know; he looked into his basket, and missed these two parcels.

            , Sen. I went to Admiral Drummond's - I left my basket in the area while I went into the kitchen to speak to the servants; when I came up the officer met me, and I missed these things.

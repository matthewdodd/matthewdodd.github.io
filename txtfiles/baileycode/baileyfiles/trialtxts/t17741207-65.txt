            . This was an old copper, it used to stand in a hay-loft, where I live, it was lost between the 26th and 27th of October, or there about; I was not at home at the time; when I came home on the Sunday morning, it had been taken away and brought back again.

            . On Thursday either the 26th or 27th of October, I took up the prisoner in Hogg-Lane, with this copper (producing it) which he was offering to sale; he first of all, said it was his own, afterwards he said he had been employed by another man (who was with him at the time, and who ran away) to sell this copper.
Taylor. This is my copper, the prisoner must have seen it scores of times; he used to go up at times and fetch corn out of it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was only employed as a porter
, I never offered it to sale at all; but the other people that hired me as a porter offered it to sale.

            . There were two other people with the prisoner; but the prisoner asked me if I bought copper.
Taylor. I know nothing to impeach his character, as an honest man; I turned him away for keeping bad hours.

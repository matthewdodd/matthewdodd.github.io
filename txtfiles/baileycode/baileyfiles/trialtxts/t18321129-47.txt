            . I am a servant, but out of a situation. On the morning of the 17th of November I saw the prisoner near the Merlin's Cave public-house - he went in, and had nothing, but he came out again with a brass candlestick wrapped up in a pocket handkerchief; I stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said something he was going to sell to get something to eat; I took it from him - he ran off, but I took him; I gave the candlestick to Mr. Edwards' servant, who is not here, but I know this is the same that I gave her.

            . I keep the Merlin's Cave




. This is my candlestick - my servant gave it to the officer.

             (Police-constable C 61.) I received this candlestick from Mr. Edwards' servant.
Prisoner. It is the same candlestick; I should not have stolen it if I had not been without food for three days- it is a thing I never do.

ELIZABETH WEST
 was indicted

for stealing, on 
17th of January, 2 handkerchiefs, value 3s., the goods of 



Henry Wharton and 



John Wharton; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE TRAVELL
. I am shopman to Henry and John Wharton, pawnbrokers, in Bermondsey-street. On the 17th of January the prisoner pledged a gown for half-a-crown—as she was going out my attention was drawn to her—Bennett fetched her back, and two handkerchiefs dropped from her—the officer was passing at the time—the prisoner was very violent, and in dragging her into the shop a gown-piece fell from her—I delivered the handkerchiefs to the officer—these are them—they are my masters'—they had been hanging two yards and a half inside the shop when the prisoner came in.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. When had you seen them? A. About five minutes before—there is no mark on them.





ROBERT BENNETT
. I am shopman to Messrs. Wharton. I saw the prisoner in their shop on the 17th, and followed her out—I brought her back, and on the way she droped this black silk handkerchief—the boy picked it up, and brought it to her—she said it was not hers—this other handkerchief I took from under her cloak—she struck me on the head—I dropped the handkerchiefs in the scuffle, and they were taken up by another person.





JOHN KELLY
 (police-constable M 85.) I took charge of the prisoner and the articles.





HENRY TRITON
 (police-constable M 175.) I know the prisoner, and was present at Newington, in 1836, when she was tried—I have the certificate of her conviction from the Clerk of the Peace's office—(read.) 


GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

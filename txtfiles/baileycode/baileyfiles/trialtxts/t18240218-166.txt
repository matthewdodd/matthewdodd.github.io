            . I am errand-boy to Mr. Chandler. On the 19th of February the prisoner came into the shop with another boy, and asked for low priced shoes. I shewed them some, which would not suit - they then asked for laced boots; he said he would go for the money, and come in half an hour; the prisoner asked if I had any to fit him - I shewed him some; they both left together, saying, they would go for the money. I saw the prisoner take a pair of women's shoes off the rail, and put them under his coat - I went out, took hold of him, and took them from him - the other ran away.

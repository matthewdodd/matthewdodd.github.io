            . I am a cook on board a ship
. On the 19th of November I received my pay, and stopped at the prisoner's house that night, in Blue Coat-fields


. I gave her a 10 l., a 5 l., and two 1 l. notes to take care of till the morning, as I was too late to go home. Next morning she gave me the money-bag. I can neither read nor write, She said,
"Here is a ten, a five, and a two." I went to the barber's to ask if it was right. He said there was no 10 l. among them. She had given me three ones and a five. I am sure I gave a 10 l. I made her a present of 35 s. in silver. She returned the other notes. I have known her eleven years.

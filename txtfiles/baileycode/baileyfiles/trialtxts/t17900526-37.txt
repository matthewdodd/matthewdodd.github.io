            , and Matthew Handcock. Part of the silk stockings were taken the 29th of April; I cannot tell when the others were taken; they were all found together; the prisoner was footman and porter and stept in the warehouse, to take in, we suspected him some time silk stockings were in his box on Friday the 30th of April; he was then in house; I saw them in the box, but did not see the box opened: Newman, the constable, has the stockings; I knew one by the clock; there were six pair in the box, in the whole.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This man came to Mr. Wakefield, from Salisbury? - Yes.

Darwin. This is the remarkable pair, that I swear to by the point of the clock: I can say for certain, that some were missing from the parcels.

             is the only partner in town; and he very seldom sells.
Jury. Do you make these stockings? - The man that works for us, does not work for other people.

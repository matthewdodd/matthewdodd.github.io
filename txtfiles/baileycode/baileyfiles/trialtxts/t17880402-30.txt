I live in Fleet-street


; I am a jeweller
; on the 6th of March, my man had been gone out about ten minutes; I had quitted my shop about five minutes to go into the back parlor; my man brought in the prisoner, with one pair of stone knee-buckles; there was only myself, daughter, and maid servant at home.

             sworn.
I went on business, and coming home, I saw Delaney take his hand out of the shop window, and put his hand in his pocket; the prisoner Delaney turned round, and saw me; then they both ran off in company together; I pursued them, and caught Cameron, the other ran on; I cried, stop thief! I delivered up Cameron to a man, while I pursued Delaney past St. Dunstan's church, and caught him in Chancery-lane, when one of the snuff-boxes dropt on my foot by my shaking him; I took him, and brought him to the other prisoner, and took them both to the shop, and searched them, and found none of the property; the snuff-box was given in my presence to the constable; it was my master's property.

             sworn.
I was passing down Fleet-street; I saw Cameron drop a pair of knee-buckles; I picked them up, and gave them to the constable; they were dropped by Cameron.

I am a constable; I took charge of the prisoners; I know nothing of the robbery, only that a pair of stone knee-buckles and snuff-box was delivered to me by Fauldo and Bradshaw.
(Produced and deposed to.)

Prosecutor. I know them by my shop-mark, which has remained on them ever since; the things before they were lost, were laying on the shop-window, not in the shew-glass, the glass was cracked by the prisoners; they had been seen walking past for two or three days before; the glass was cracked by one of the prisoners, who broke a piece out; it was not done five minutes after the prosecutor left his shop; the buckles were about four inches from the glass of the window, the snuff-box about five inches; I lost four pair of knee-buckles and three snuff-boxes.
PRISONER CAMERON's DEFENCE.
I was going out of an errand; I knew nothing of it, and was stopped, not knowing for what.

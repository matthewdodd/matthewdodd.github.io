                  Elgar

                  Elgar 
               



            .]

                  Taylor 
               



            . I do, I act for Mr. Sheppard, it was sworn before me.
Hopper. I filed up this affidavit in the name of Elgar.
Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Hopper. The Prisoner came on the 2d of March, and said he wanted to enter an action, and gave me a little bit of paper, and in that paper was wrote, Edman Elger and 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Travers 
               



            .
Q. Where did he live?
Hopper . He said, he lived on Saffron-Hill , and was a broker; I desired the Prisoner to sign his name to it, and I administred the oath to him.
Q. Did he sign it himself?
Hopper . Yes.
The Plaint was read, viz. Edman Elger, Plaintiff , and 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Travers

             is indebted to him 40 l. 0 s. 6 d. for victuals, drink, and lodging.
Hopper . The first time I saw the name, it was spelt 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Elgar 
               



            .


                  John 
                  Cuthbertson 
               



             sworn.
Q. What are you?
Cuthbertson . I am a Sergeant at Mace at Woodstreet Compter .
Q. Do you know any thing of this affair ?
Cutbbertson . Yes; on the 2d of March last, between the hours of three and four, this 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Blake 
               



            , who represented 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Elgar 
               



            , came to me, and asked me what it would cost to take out a Writ? I suppose, said I, you mean an Action; I do, says he, what will it cost? I said 4 s. 1 d. Said he, I paid but 2 s. before: I told him, that was on the account that there was no affidavit made at that time; it was after the act was expired, and before it was renewed.
Q. Did you know who he was?
Cuthbertson . Yes, I did, I have known him several years.
Q. Did you know him to be 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Blake 
               



            ?
Cuthbertson . Yes: Well , said he, you shall go and take it out, and do it directly, and ordered the Defendant to be arrested immediately; he said, it was to be done in Bishopsgate street. I did not go to the person directly, but went to the office to Mr. Tyler for a stamp; he gave me a stamp, and I gave it to Mr. Hopper to fill up.
Q. Was that the stamp for the affidavit?
Cuthbert . Yes; it was wrote, Edman Elger, Plt. and 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Travers 
               



            , Deft. (in short) and 40 l. 0 s. 6 d. in figures.
Q. Did you suspect the Prisoner then?
Cuthbertson . No; when he pulled out the little bit of paper with the two names on it, that was the discovery of it: when Mr. Hopper had wrote the two names on the affidavit, Mr. Hopper asked of what place and trade 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Elgar 
               



             was? and he said, my name is 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Elgar 
               



            , of Saffron-hill, broker ; which confused me, for I never saw such a thing before: I then went out of the office, and when I came back the affidavit was filled up, and I saw him sign his name to it, and swear to it, and I got him taken into custody upon it; then we came out of the office together, and he asked me to go along with him and do it; I said , I could not just then go along with him, and he gave me the precept into my hand to arrest the Defendant, and desired I would do it immediately; I told him I could not go then, but if he would stay a little, I would go along with him: he said he would go to the sign of the Dolphin in Honey-Lane Market, and get a pint of beer, and wait for me till I came ; as soon as he was gone, I went back to the office, and told the gentlemen in the office, that I knew him to be one 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Blake 
               



            .
Q. Was Mr. Tyler there?

Cuthbertson . Yes; I consulted with them, and told them, I thought it would be proper to take him into custody. Then I went to Mr. Davis at Ludgate , to get Mr. Travers to come, for I knew they were acquainted, and we went and got a copy of the affidavit .
Q. Did you see Mr. Travers?
Cuthbertson . Yes, but not till about six o'clock that evening. Mr. Davis sent to us to meet him at the Half-Moon tavern in Cheapside , and we went with the Prisoner to Sir 
               
                  Henry 
                  Marhall 
               



            's and he ordered us to take him into custody : he was not taken into custody till Mr. Travers came , but he did not stay at the Dolphin till I came back, for he went to the King's-Head in Wood-street, and enquired for me; and I said to Mr. Travers, in order to come at the thing, and to hear what the Prisoner would say, to Mr. Travers , you never will own your debts, and I told him , I would take him to his Plaintiff; so I took him to the Prisoner, and Mr. Travers said, he did not owe him any thing, and he did not know him; and the Prisoner said, does not he? d - n him, I will make him sensible of it before I leave him; at the same time he took as much care as he could to conceal his face.
Q. What did he say before Sir 
               
                  Henry 
                  Marshall 
               



            ?
Cuthbertson . He said no more than this, that he did not know he had done any hurt.
Q. Did the Defendant bail the action?
Cuthbertson . The Defendant did bail the action, and it was nonsuited by Mr. Graves the attorney.
Q. Did he say any thing else?
Cuthbertson . He told Sir Henry, he did not kiss the book.
Q. to Hopper . Did you swear him in the usual manner?
Hopper. Yes, I gave him the book into his right hand .
Q. Do you believe he kissed the book?
Hopper . I believe he did; I bid him do it, but I cannot swear whether he did or no.
Q. If you had thought he had not kissed the book, would not you have made him do it?
Hopper. I would have scratched his name out, if he had not.
Prisoner. Ask Mr. Cuthbertson, whether I did not tell him that it was for another man ?
Cuthbertson. He did not tell me who was the Plaintiff or the Defendant, I have known him a great many years.
Pris. Did not you arrest Mr. Travers?
Cuthbertson. He gave bail to the action that afternoon, but I did not care to serve it.
Pris. Did you tell Mr. Travers this as you came along?
Cuthbertson. Yes, I told him there was an action entered against him, and by whom.
Q. What, that it was Blake that had sworn to it, and taken it out in the name of Elgar ? How came you to take bail for such an action?
Cuthbertson . It was by direction.
Prisoner. Did not I ask you several times, whether it was not a wrong thing to do so?
Cuthbertson. You never said any such thing; you never told me who was Plaintiff or Defendant; and I never saw the paper before it was laid down before Mr. Hopper .


                  Joshua 
                  Travers 
               



             sworn.
Q. Did Mr. Cuthbertson , the officer, come to you about an action?
Travers. I was sent for, and I saw Mr. Weaver, and he did arrest me for 40 l. and 6 d. in the Half-Moon Passage.
Q. What is Mr. Weaver?
Travers. He is a serjeant at mace.
Cuthbertson. He is my partner.
Travers. Mr. Cuthbertson said he believed it was a vile action, and that he believed he could find the person; and Mr. Weaver, Mr. Cuthbertson, and the marshal's man and I, went to the Dolphin in Honey-Lane Market, and Blake was gone, but we found him at the King's Head in Wood street.
Q. Did any discourse pass there?
Travers. It was between dusk and light, and we had a candle brought , and Mr. Weaver said, there is your man . I looked at the Prisoner, and I said, I never saw you before in my life, how came you to have an action of 40 l. against me? and the Prisoner said, that is to myself, whether I knew you or not.
Q. Do you know this Elgar?
Travers. Yes.
Q. Is he a broker on Saffron-hill?
Travers. He was; he is a sheep-driver by business.
Q. Did you owe that 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Elgar 
               



             any thing?
Travers. I never owed him any thing in my life .
Q. Was you indebted, at this time, to Edmund Elgar, or the Prisoner, either to one or the other?
Travers. No, not to my knowledge.

Q. Had you ever any victuals , or drink, or lodging , found you by this 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Elgar 
               



            ?
Travers. No, my Lord.
Prisoner. Ask him whether his wife and children did not live with Elgar?
Travers. My Lord, for a year and an half I was robbed of my wife, and this Elgar and my wife wanted to rob me of all I had.
Q. Was it by your consent that she went there?
Travers. No, my Lord; they found a way to lock me up eleven months in Ludgate, and robbed me of all I had; Esquire Davis knows the whole affair, and I have a note of 50 l. from Elgar to Mrs. Travers.
Q. Where is your wife now?
Travers. My wife has been dead three or four months, and the two children were sent home to me. She sent for me about an hour and an half before she died, and delivered some old things to me, and there was a note of Elgar's hand, payable to my wife, for 50 l.
Prisoner. This Elgar was, at this time, under arrest by Travers.
Travers. No, my Lord, it was not so, there was one Nice arrested him upon his own account.


                  William 
                  Weaver 
               



             sworn.
Q. What do you know of this?
Weaver . I know nothing of the entering the action; my partner told me, Blake has been here, and has sworn himself to be Elgar, for I know Elgar very well; so we went to Mr. Davis, for I believe he was a Prisoner with Mr. Davis then. I believe Elgar has ruined the man.
Travers. I am told that Mr. Blake is sometimes crazy, and half mad, and I heartily forgive him, and I hope the Court will be merciful to him.
Weaver. I know he was going to take seven pounds yesterday, in order to make the matter up, but my partner and I were determined to bring the affair to light.



               Guilty
            .
There was another Indictment against him for forgery, but he was not tried upon that.
The Judgment of the Court was, that 



               he stand in, and upon the pillory, in Cheapside, for the space of one hour
            , and be 


               transported for seven years
            .

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of September, I saw the prisoners in company together at Brandenburg House, attempting to pick people's pockets; Wilks went out of the crowd into a corner, and was fumbling about his breeches. I secured him, and found two handkerchiefs in his hat, and this watch in his fob; hesaid he bought it at Bristol. The prisoner was in his company.

            . I live with Mr. Dobree, a pawnbroker
, in Holborn


. On the 17th of March, between one and two in the afternoon, when I was in the shop, I saw the prisoner put his hand through a broken pane of glass, and take a handfull of gold that lay on a board in the window to shew; we buy light gold; I ran out and secured him before he had got five yards; I took the pieces of gold mentioned in the indictment out of his hand; the guineas and half guineas were light but not cut. I did not know what was in the window.
The constable deposed that he found the pieces of money in the prisoner's hand that are mentioned in the indictment.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am a soldier
: I had been at my quarters to receive a month's money; being very much in liquor, as I was going by this man's shop, a porter pushed me against the window, my hand went through, and the money came into it.
For the prisoner.

            . I am a serjeant in the guards; the prisoner belongs to the same company I do: I have known him seven years as a soldier, but know nothing of his private character.




               Guilty of stealing but not in the dwelling house

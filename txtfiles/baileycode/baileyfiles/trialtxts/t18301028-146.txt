. On the evening of the 12th of October I missed a pair of trousers from inside the door; I had seen them in the course of the afternoon - I missed them at half-past five o'clock, when I took the things in from the door; these are them - they have a mark on the waistband.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner from Newman - he said they were his brother's trousers, and his mother had sent him to pawn them; in going to the watch-house he said his mother knew nothing about them, but he had taken them out of his brother's box, who lived with a white-smith, at No.13 or 14, Barbican.

WILLIAM PALMER
. I am shopman to John Orick Kennard. On the 14th of September the prisoner came into the shop in company with another female—they asked for some prints, which I shewed them—the prisoner walked across to the opposite counter, where there were some handkerchiefs, looked at them, and then came back and asked the price—I saw her hand go to her bosom—I then took her and found this handkerchief in the bosom of her dress—I had seen it safe previous to her looking at the handkerchiefs, and missed this.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

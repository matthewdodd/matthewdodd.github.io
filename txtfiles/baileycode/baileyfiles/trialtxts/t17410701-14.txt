            . On the 5th of last June I was inform'd by a neighbour, that some of my goods were sold to one Tompkins in Moor Fields. I went to him and brought him to my house, and he said the Prisoner, who is my servant
, was the person of whom he had the goods. Upon this I carried the Prisoner before a Magistrate, and he own'd that he mov'd my goods away and sold them to Tompkins.

            . The unhappy person at the Bar is my son: his character from his cradle has always been honest and just, and no one can charge him with a dishonest action.

            . I have known the Prisoner a great many Years, and never knew but that he was a very honest fellow.

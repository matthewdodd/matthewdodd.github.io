            . I live at the French Horn, Holbourn


, I keep a stable-yard
, I lost a couple of hammer-cloths on the 11th of August in the night from the carriages; my ostler found them upon two Jews the next day; we took the two Jews before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , they were committed to Bridewell, they were there from the Thursday till the Monday; then they were let out upon bail to find the prisoner out; the prisoner was taken about a fortnight after for another offence, I heard him own the cloths were my property.

            . I know Mr. Steel lost the two cloths from off his carriages; I went to see the prisoner when in prison, there I heard him confess he stole the two hammer-cloths from off Mr. Steel's carriages; he said he should not be tried for them, because he knew he should be transported for another offence, so he very readily confessed it.
Prisoner's defence.
Mr. Steel gave me half a crown, and said he would not hurt me.
Steel. I desired he would let me know if he took them, because I would not blame an innocent man; he said he knew he should be transported for what he was put in for, he said he did take them; then I gave him half a crown.
Prisoner. I was out of work, and it was for want that I did it.



               Guilty
            . 


               T
            .
See him tried before, No 28, in this Mayoralty.

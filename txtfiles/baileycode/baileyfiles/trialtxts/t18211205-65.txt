            . I am waggoner to Mr. 
               
                  Joseph 
                  White
               



             of Winwaldon, in Essex, about twenty-six miles off. On the 15th of November, about seven o'clock in the morning, I drove my waggon into Whitechapel


, the box was on the top of the waggon, secured by a cord; I took it off to deliver it to Mr. Parkins, it was a blue wooden box; my waggon stood at the door near the church; I set it on the shafts, I had a boy with me, I went to the hind part of the waggon, to tie the rope, and in the mean time it was stolen, it contained apples. Reynolds came up, and I saw three men run up George-yard.

            . I am an officer. About seven o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitechapel, and saw the four prisoners, with three or four others, stopping at the corner of George-yard, about twenty-five yards from the waggon, I knew them well before. When I had passed them about fifty yards, I looked back, and saw they had advanced near the waggon, and at that instant, Mason went from the others, and took the box off the shafts, and returned with it on his shoulder to the others. All ran away together as far as George-yard; Mason, Daley, and another, (not in custody,) ran up George-yard with the box. Clark and Hitchings went with the rest up Whitechapel. I informed the man of his loss, and we followed up George-yard, but they turned into a court, and I lost them. I went into Whitechapel, and took Hitchings and Clark in less than five minutes. About an hour after, I apprehended Mason, at the corner of George-yard. Daley was taken on Sunday. I am certain of them all. It was a blue wooden box.
DALEY. Q. Did you not say I took it - A. Never.

            . - I am an officer, I apprehended Daley on Sunday evening, at a house in George-yard, I told him I took him for stealing a box out of Whitechapel; he said, he thought there were two or three committed already for it; I said, Yes, and I wanted him also; I took him from the description Reynolds gave me.

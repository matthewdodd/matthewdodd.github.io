; I lost my things on board a ship; my clothes were in a bag. I only know that I lost my things; who took them I cannot say.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in a boat with this bag of clothes; the boots and the shoes were out of the bag, loose in the boat. I asked him who the bag of clothes belonged to; he said, to two boys: seeing the boots and shoes were too big for a boy, I took him in custody, and found out the owner Allen.
Q. To Allen. Look at the clothes in the bag - A. They are all mine, and the boots and shoes are mine.

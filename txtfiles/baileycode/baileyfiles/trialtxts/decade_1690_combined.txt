            . Having little to say in his Defence, he was found

, but upon some faults committed by him, was treatned to be turned away; the night before the Robbery was committed, having seen the Prosecutor to bed, and how he had placed his Watch, Ring, and other of the Goods, took occasion before morning to steal the Goods, and was gone, but being discovered was brought to confess his taking them, and said they were hid in a Ditch in St. George's Fields; search being made, the Plate was carried away by one Gray, and some of the Confederates, upon notice of his being taken, only the Prosecutor's Table-Basket was found on the place; and when Hays was seized, some pieces of the plate bruised was found about him; and some of the Goods were found at Pawnbrokers.

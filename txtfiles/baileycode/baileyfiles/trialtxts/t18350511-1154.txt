WILLIAM GRANT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of April, 2 coats, value 5l.; the goods of 



Thomas Keogh.






THOMAS KEOGH
. I am servant to the Honourable Mrs. Carter, of Richmond. On the 13th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was with her carriage in Leicester-square—I got off the carriage to wait for my mistress coming from the Panorama—I had left two coats on the dicky behind, one was my own, the other a young gentleman's who was with my mistress; when I went back to the carriage with my mistress the coats were gone—these are them.





JOSEPH ASTELL
. I am an officer. I was in Castle-street—I saw the prisoner running very fast with some clothes on his arms; I pursued and took him with these two coats; I said we had had a very sharp run—he said, "Yes, we have, I must make the best of a bad bargain"—the pro-secutor came up and claimed the property.

Prisoner's Defence. I deny that I said I had had a sharp run—I deny stealing the coats, or being in the street—I was going down Castle-street and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw a man drop the coats—I pursued him, and was taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years.

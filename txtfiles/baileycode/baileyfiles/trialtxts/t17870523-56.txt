             sworn.
On the 30th of April, I came from Hounslow to buy me some clothes, and coming along Fleet-market, a man recommended me to a bed in George-alley


; and 
               
                  Mary
                   Dawson
               



             opened the door, and 
               
                  Sarah
                   Graham
               



             lighted me to bed, and she said, if I would give her a shilling, I should have to do with her; and while we were upon the bed, I heard somebody coming up stairs, and she put her hand in my pocket and took my purse out and gave it to the other; Graham took it; they ran down stairs and I followed them; they were taken in George-alley in another house; I am sure these are the women; I was as sober, as I am now; I had been with nobody before, only drinking some beer with a shop-mate; they offered me my money.

I took charge of the prisoners; they denied they had received any money but half a guinea; they said that he had no more.

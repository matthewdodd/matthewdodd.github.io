JOHN SCOTT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of October, 46 yards of carpet, value 4l., the goods of 



Thomas Herd.







HENRY JAMES BUTLER
. I am in the employ of Thomas Herd, of Blackfriars-road. On the 6th of October, between seven and eight o'clock I missed the carpet produced, which is my employer's—I had seen it safe about seven.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where was it? A. Against the door-post—a person could take it without coming inside.





GEORGE MARVIN
. I live in Church-street, Black friars-road. I was at my master's door, in Church-street—I saw some man bring the carpet round the corner—the prisoner took it from his shoulder, and I followed them over the bridge—the prosecutor's shop is three doors from Church-street—I first saw the prisoner in Church-street, and the other man brought it round the corner—I did not see any one with the prisoner—I called a policeman.

Cross-examined. Q. Where is your shop? A. Five doors up the street—I did not see a policeman on the other side of the bridge—I was not acquainted with the policeman to whom I gave the prisoner—I never saw him before—I gave information to the policeman, and went back to my shop—I did not see the man taken.





FRANCIS M'DONALD
 (City police-constable, No. 239.) I took the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Marvin? A. Yes, since the 6th of this month—I took the prisoner on the pavement in Bridewell—I asked him how he came by the carpet—he said some one gave it him to carry—he did not point out any one, nor say where he was to take it—I did not ask him.
(James James; Charles Simpson, of Saffron-hill; Henry Sims, a harness-maker; John Shaw, a saddler; and Frances Tyfield; gave the prisoner a good character.)

            . I am a boot closer
, and live in King-street, Soho. On the 8th of November, I was passing down Drury-lane


 with 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Benham
               



            . The prisoner and two others pushed suddenly against me; he snatched my watch, and ran down a court with it. I pursued, and secured him without losing sight of him - he said he had not got it. I felt it in his coat pocket, and took it from him - the other two escaped.


                  SARAH 
                  BENHAM
               



            . I was with Nelson. Three persons came up, and the prisoner took his watch. He secured the prisoner, and took it from him before I lost sight of him.

 was indicted

for stealing, on the

Edward Mitchell.







ALFRED MITCHELL
. I live with my father, Edward Mitchell, a tobacconist, in Albion-place, Islington. On the 3rd of March I was behind the counter—the prisoner came in, and asked for two halfpence for a penny—I turned my back, and missed a box of cigars—I went out, and saw him walking round the corner with it under his arm—I ran after him—he saw me, and ran away—he was stopped, and brought back with it—this is the box and cigars.

Prisoner. The witness said that two labouring men brought the box, and I was taken half an hour after; he denied that I was the person when I was first taken. Witness. No, I did not—I have no doubt that he is the person who took them—I was always sure he was the person—I said it was him directly.





ROBERT BRAY
 (police-constable N 178.) I searched the prisoner, and found the two halfpence on him—I produce the box of cigars.

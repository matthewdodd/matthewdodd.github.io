            . I live in Seven-step Alley, Petticoat Lane


. On the 26th of March, I lost a gown and a pair of stays, out of the bed chamber where I lodge, up one pair of stairs.
Q. What reason had you to suspect the prisoner took them?

S. Baldwin. I took her up on suspicion, and she confessed that she took them.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
S. Baldwin. I never saw her before in my life.
Q. How came you to know her so as to take her?
S. Baldwin. I took her up by the description* a pawnbroker gave me of her. I had been to several, and at one pawnbroker's I found my stays, and he described her.
* The prisoner had remarkable sore eyes.
Q. What is the pawnbroker's name?
S. Baldwin. His name is 
               
                  Moses 
                  Coronell 
               



            . Another pawnbroker's name is 
               
                  Robert 
                  Taylor 
               



            . She had pawn'd the stays at Coronell's, and the gown at Taylor's (the gown and stays produced, and deposed to.)
Q. Did you lend your gown to the prisoner?
S. Baldwin. I never lent it nor gave it to any body.
Q. What did the prisoner say for herself?
S. Baldwin. At first she did not own it, but at last she did, and said where she had pawned them both.

Prisoner's Defence.
It was a young girl that I kept company with who gave me the gown and stays to pawn; she was going down to Coventry the same day. She was in a great deal of distress, her name is

            . I live at Burton in Somersetshire; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment at the Black-and-all-Black at Hyde-park-corner


, in a stable, about a month ago; the prisoner was taken the Saturday following on the other side Edgware, with my coat and waistcoat, and one of my shirts on his back, the other shirt and neck-cloth were tied up in a handkerchief; I found my handkerchief at a pawnbroker's; he was underostler at the stable where they were taken from.
Prisoner's defence.
He brought the coat into the stable, and offered to sell it; I had not money to pay for them, but offered to pay at so much a week; I went to-bed, and in the morning I found them lying there; I thought he brought them to let me have them, my mother being sick; I put them on to go to see her, and intended to be up in two or three days again.

            . On the 18th of June coming through the Monument Yard


, I saw a company of women, and asked what those people were there for; they said they are the wives of those persons who are gone to Flanders ; while I was standing there I felt, as I thought, a hand at my breeches pocket*, I put my hand in this pocket and my handkerchief was gone; the Prisoner was just by me, his right hand was under his apron, and his left hand in his bosom. I had a suspicion of him, took his apron up, and he dropped the handkerchief down upon his feet; I took it up, took him by the arm, and carried him (I think) to the White Hart by Bishopsgate. I said if I could get a good character of him I would not prosecute him. I sent for his mother, and she said he was a vile boy
, and behaved very undutifully, and had followed this practice these two years.
*The Prosecutor found in the Prisoner's left hand near three pounds that he had taken out of his breeches pocket, but out of tenderness to him he would not lay that in the indictment.
Prisoner. My father and mother-in-law were always vile people to me, or I should not have been drove to this way of living. 


               Guilty 10 d.

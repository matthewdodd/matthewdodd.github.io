; the prisoner had been our servant
 two years next February; he was confidentially employed by us; I applied for a search warrant from Bow-street; Carpmeal accompanied me to the prisoner's lodgings, in Great Wild-street; he was at home; he said, he had no property of ours; Carpmeal searched in my presence; we found a roll of silver, in six or eight pieces, on the tester of the bed; it was some virgin silver, and some sterling silver; the plated bradoons were under the bed in a box, and a harness buckle, and a plated nail.

             sworn.
I am an officer of Bow-street; I went with Mr. Lewin to the prisoner's lodgings, and found these things; (Producing them) I asked the prisoner, if he had any thing belonging to Mr. Lewin? he said, he had not; when I found the silver, he said there was nothing more; he begged for mercy of his master, and Mr. Lewin told him, he had put it out of his power to shew him any mercy; I was present when this confession was signed.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Before that is read, did not he say a great deal more than what is taken down in writing? - He asked several times for mercy.
Now, among other things, did not he say this, that he was going to take it back that morning? - He did.
How happened it, that was not taken down in writing? - I do not know.
Therefore, besides saying what is taken down, to affect him, he said, it was his purpose to have restored every thing that he had taken? - He did not go so far as that.

Mr. Garrow to Mr. Lewin. I may venture to ask you, till this affair, you had a good opinion of him? - I had, indeed.

.* 
Eden Wareham. I live in George-street


; on the 2d of Jan. I lost the things mentioned, some from a line, hanging up to dry in my apartment, and some in a chest in my room. The prisoner work'd with me as a journeywoman in winding silk, and lay with me; she got up to make a fire as usual: she said she had occasion to use the pot and must carry it down. She did not return; then I went to get up and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I have since found the quilted petticoat and cloak. Produced in court and deposed to.

            . I live in East-smithfield; the prisoner at the bar brought the petticoat and cloak to me about the 9th of Jan. I lent her 8 s. on the petticoat, and 1 s. 6 d. on the cloak. She brought them as her own property.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

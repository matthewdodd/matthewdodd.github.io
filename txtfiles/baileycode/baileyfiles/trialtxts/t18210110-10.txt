                  LAMBERT
               



            . I am Knight Commander of the Bath. On the 4th of January, about two o'clock, I was just by St. Clement's Church


, a person in front of me told me I had been robbed. I heard a cry of Stop thief! turned round, and saw my pocket-book in the middle of the street, Sweeny was picking it up - some persons were in pursuit of the prisoner.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were not conscious of having been robbed - A. No.


                  WILLIAM 
                  TUCKER
               



            . I saw a man in company with the prisoner take the pocket-book from the prosecutor's pocket and give it to the prisoner, who put it into his pocket; I informed Sir John of it, and then collared the prisoner, who struck me a violent blow and got off. He was taken down Milford-lane - I am sure he is the man.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you never say you doubted it - A. No.

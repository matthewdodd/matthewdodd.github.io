JOHN FARRELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of July, 1 necklace, value 12s., the goods of 



Henry Macrae, from the person of 



Elizabeth Macrae; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






LUCY BROWN
. I am servant to Henry Macrae, of Aldgate. On the 30th of July I was out with his daughter Elizabeth, who is about a year old—I was standing in Whitechapel—the child had a necklace on—I felt a tug at the child, and something touched my shoulder—I turned, and saw the prisoner with the necklace in his hand—he ran away, and when he got a little way from me he stopped—I walked towards him—he ran, and got quite away—he was taken, and I found him at the station-house—I am quite certain he is the person—this is the necklace—(examining one.)

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there another there? A. There was a boy near, that I called to stop him—the necklace was got from the pawnbroker's—the ticket was sent to my master.





JOHN SIMS
. I live with my father—he is a tailor. I saw the prisoner running up the street, and Brown running after him—I attempted to stop him—he knocked me down, and got away—when a man tried to stop him, he went under the man's arms—I went into the next street with Brown—he ran away again, we then all went to the watch-house, and afterwards

saw him in Crispin-street, with a lot of boys—he saw us, and walked away from his companions.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was him? A. Yes—I knew him before.





WILLIAM ALDERMAN
 (police-sergeant H 7.) I went after the prisoner, and saw him in Crispin-street—I took him—the duplicate of this necklace was sent to the prosecutor, and I got the necklace.





CHARLES CHAMBERS
 (City police-constable, No, 523.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 12,—


Transported for Ten Years.

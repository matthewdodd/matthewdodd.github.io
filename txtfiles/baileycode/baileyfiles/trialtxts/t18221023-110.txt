            . I am the son of 
               
                  
                     David

            , a packing-case maker
; he lives in Brydges-street, Covent Garden; the prisoner was in his service as errand-boy
 for two months; my father sent him to Mr. Jupp, Bond-street, for 5 l., about the 31st of August, 1821; he never returned. I am certain of his person.

            . I sent the prisoner to Mr. Jupp's with some boxes, and to receive 5 l. I gave him a ticket for Mr. Jupp to sign, on having received the boxes; he never returned either with the bill or money. I sent for him to his father's house several times, but could not find him.

            . My father owed Mr. Harrow 5 l. I cannot say whether the prisoner was the person who came; but about the 31st of August the money was applied for, and I paid five sovereigns. I do not recollect whether he brought any boxes or books. Mr. Harrow called about it three or four hours after.

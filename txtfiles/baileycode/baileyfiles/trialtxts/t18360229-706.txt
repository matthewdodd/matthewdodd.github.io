SARAH TAYLOR
. I am the wife of James Taylor, a fisherman—he fishes on the coast of Holland—our home is No. 11, Globe-yard, Black-wall. The prisoner lived in our neighbourhood—he goes about selling potatoes—on the 6th of February he came and asked me to buy some—I refused—he carried the potatoes in a truck—he showed me some, and at last I went to the truck, and was picking them out—he said he was going to serve a neighbour, Mr. Richards, who lives next door—he was about ten minutes away—I picked out sixpenny worth—he came back, and

said he would call for the money presently—I had left my door open—my watch was in the front room on the ground floor—I had seen it safe when I went out, and when the watch was missed the prisoner was gone—I gave information to the police, and in the course of the day the prisoner was taken, and the watch was found.





JOSEPH WHATMORE
. I am a policeman. I went to the station at a quarter past nine o'clock, and there I heard the watch had been stolen—I looked where the prisoner lived—his mother, who lives in Cottage-street, told me—I went to his house in Castle-street, Poplar—I searched about: the room and found nothing, and then went into the yard—in one corner I saw the earth had been disturbed—I turned it over, and found the watch, wrapped in a handkerchief, buried in the ground—that was on the 6th February—it was lost about eight o'clock at night—I searched the same night.





SARAH TAYLOR
. This is my watch.

Prisoner. I never saw it.

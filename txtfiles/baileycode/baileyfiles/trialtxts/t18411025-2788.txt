JOSEPH GROUT
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
24th of September, 1 gown, value 3s., the goods of 



William Amor; and that Grout had been before convicted of felony.






ALFRED ROLFE RANDALL
. I am servant to Mr. William Amor, of Lambeth-walk. On the morning of the 24th of September he had a gown hanging at the door for sale—I missed it when the policeman came in the evening—this now produced is it.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFF
 (police constable L 31.) On the 24th of September, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in company near Newington church—I followed them to Lambeth-walk—I saw them go into the lobby of the prosecutor's shop—they came out and went about two hundred yards, then came back and went in again—I waited, and Dowley came out towards me—I stopped her, and took this gown worn under her shawl—Grout went across the road.

Dowley. I was coming down the walk, and saw the gown lying between the shop and the passage; I put it under my arm, and the policeman caught me; I said, "Let me go," and I gave him the gown.





ALFRED ROLFE RANDALL
. No; the gown was tied up inside.





JAMES BROOK
. I was with Goff—we watched the prisoners from Newington church—they were together all the time—I saw Dowley reach up and unpin the gown, and Grout was watching through the window at the time.





SAMUEL WRIGHT
 (police-constable P 172.) I produce a certificate of Grout's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.

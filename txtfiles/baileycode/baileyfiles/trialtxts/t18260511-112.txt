JAMES JOSHUA HARDY. I live with my father. I was in St. James's Park


 on the 24th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning - Gook, the officer, came, and gave me information; I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I saw it in his possession; he had taken it from the breeches of Clark.

                  GOOK
               



            . I was in St. James's Park. I saw all the three prisoners in company, following Mr. Hardy, at the time the Guards were brigaded - Mr. Hardy fell back at the time the circle was formed; I saw Coats take the handkerchief from his pocket, and it got into Clark's breeches - I had heard the words "Got it" from Smith - I think he said, "Have you got it."

            . I was in the Park, and saw the three prisoners in company, behind the prosecutor. I saw Coats take the handkerchief, and give it to Clark - I took it out of his breeches, and showed it to the prosecutor, who owned it.

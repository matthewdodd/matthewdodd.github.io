MARTHA RESTELL
. I am a widow, and live in Quaker-street, Spital-fields—the prisoner lived there. On Wednesday, the 17th of October, I missed my shawl from off the bedstead in the room—I had been out all day at work—she was there, and had an opportunity of taking it.





ROBERT BRODIE
 (police-constable L 132.) On the 18th of October, I was in Mr. Archibald's shop in the Borough—the prisoner and another came into the shop—one of them produced the shawl—I heard them give the name of Smith, No.' 3, New Cut, that roused my suspicions—I stopped the shawl, and took the prisoner.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Recommended to the Penitentiary.


Before Mr. Recorder.

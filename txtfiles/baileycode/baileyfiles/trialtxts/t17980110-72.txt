             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an assistant elder in the India Company's warehouses, in New-street, Bishopsgate-street


; the prisoner was a labourer
 in the warehouse: On the 11th of January, I searched the prisoner, and found upon him, two pieces of chintz, one piece in the seat of his breeches, and the other piece buttoned up t the inside of his breeches in the front, between his shirt and his skin; I had suspected him some time before, and therefore I was particular in my examination of him; these are the pieces, (producing them); they are the property of the East-India Company; there were up wards of fifty men present at the time; he was taken before the Lord Mayor, and committed. We always rub them down when they go out of the warehouse, but these were concealed in such a manner, that if I had not suspected him, he might have escaped.
The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.

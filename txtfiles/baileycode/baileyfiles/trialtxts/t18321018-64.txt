                  FELLOWS
               



            . I live in Cradle-court, St. Mary-Axe


. On the 9th of October, between six and seven o'clock, while I was dressing, I heard William Clinton call his mother - my street door was found ajar, and this property missed, all of which was in the house the night before - none of the apparel was mine; I never saw the prisoner in the house.


                  WILLIAM 
                  CLINTON
               



            . I lodge in the third floor of Fellows' house. My coat, trousers, and pencil-case were at the side of my bed the night before; I shut and latched my room door - 
               
                  Frederick 
                  Clinton
               



             slept in the same room - I awoke at six o'clock in the morning, and missed my things; I had seen nobody in the house - Frederick's things were also gone; James Branch Fellows lived in the house, and his trousers were produced at the Mansion-house; the things were taken before we got up.


                  JOHN 
                  CROSS
               



            . I am a patrol of Aldgate ward. At half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 9th of October, I met the prisoner with these clothes loose under his arm - he was alone; he said he had brought them from the country - the witnesses claimed them: the prosecutors' is a private house.


                  WILLIAM 
                  PLAISTOWE
               



            , JUN. I am an officer of Aldgate ward. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought there with the property - he told me he had bought the things of a man for 12s. 6d.; I went to Fellows' house about half-past seven o'clock, and found they were taken from a bed-room where his children slept together - I found the kitchen door below was open; it has no lock, and any person could get in - the street door was open.


                  RICHARD 
                  SAMPSON
               



            . I am a watchman. I know the prosecutor's street door was fast at one o'clock in the morning; I did not see it afterwards.


                  THOMAS 
                  FELLOWS
               



            . My street door was ajar when we got up in the morning, but the chain was up; it was locked the night before - he must have got down the area, and entered at the cellar door, which communicates with the passage, and has no fastening.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had come from Maidstone, was rather in liquor, and saw these clothes under a wall; I took them up - the watchman asked where I got them: Iwas afraid to say, for fear he should take them from me, and I said I bought them - not expecting an owner, I still stood out that I bought them.

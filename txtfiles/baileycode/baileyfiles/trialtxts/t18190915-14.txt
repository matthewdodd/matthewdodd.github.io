CHARLES M'PHERSON. I am a labourer at the London Docks. On Tuesday afternoon, the 13th of August, between two and three o'clock, I was going up Leadenhall-street


 - two gentlemen were coming towards me; as I passed them, I saw the prisoner put his hand into one of their pockets, take a handkerchief out, and put it into a basket, which he held in his hand. I turned round and secured him till the officer came and took him to the watch-house - he struggled to get away. The gentlemen were gone.

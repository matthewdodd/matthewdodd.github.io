, Bull-street, Piccadilly. On the 16th of September, about twelve o'clock, I put my basket down at a door in Albemarle-street


, and left it for a few minutes; on returning I missed two loaves, and having seen the prisoner about all day, I suspected him, and set somebody to watch him. An alarm was given, and I pursued him, calling Stop thief! and saw him throw two loaves down - he was secured.

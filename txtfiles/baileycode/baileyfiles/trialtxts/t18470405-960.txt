THOMAS HUBBUCK
 (the younger.) I live in Wellclose-square. On the 25th of March, a little before five o'clock in the evening, I was in East Smithfield—I felt something shake my pocked—I turned, and no one was near me within half a yard—I had passed the prisoner, and he could not have been then half a yard from me—when I turned he was about a yard from me m and I saw be was eyeing me very attentively—I went to him and saw that his pocket projected—I opened his pocked—he resisted, and I tore his pocked—I found my handkerchief in it—when I produced it, he said it was his—I know it is mine by the private mark.

Prisoner. I was passing on the opposite side of the London Dock; I picked up the handkerchief; I did say it was mine. Witness. When he was given in charge he said he picked it up, but not when he was struggling to retain it.





WILLIAM JONES.
 I am a lighterman and waterman—I came out of St. Katharine's Dock about five minutes before five o'clock that afternoon—I crossed the road to the Brown Bear, and saw the prisoner lift up the prosecutor's coat, take the handkerchief, and put it in his left-hand pocket—the prosecutor laid hold of him, and asked what he had about him—I saw him tear his pocket, and take the handkerchief out of the pocket.

Prisoner. There were seven or eight men standing against the public-house door; a man ran by, and threw the handkerchief down; I took it up; I did not know whose it was; I was three or four yards away at the time the gentleman turned round.


 WILLIAM PEARCE ( Police-constable H 154.) I received this handkerchief from Mr. Hubbuck—I received the prisoner into custody on his charge.




GUILTY.* Aged 26.—

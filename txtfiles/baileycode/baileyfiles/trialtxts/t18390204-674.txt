MATILDA CHEESE
. I am the wife of William Cheese, a labourer; we live in Hooper's-lane, Enfield. We had a clamp of potatoes in the garden, and about nine o'clock in the evening, on the 27th of January, I found the prisoner taking some away—I knew him before, as he lives in the neighbourhood—I called a young man, and he was taken—he had got out about half a peck of potatoes—the clamp had not been opened before.





WILLIAM SKEGGS
. I lodge with the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner take the potatoes from the clamp—I took him, and he took the potatoes out of the bosom of his shirt.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

. The prisoner worked for him - on the morning of the 26th of March, I left him in the workshop, where my watch was hanging on a nail - he came down soon after, and said he had the head-ache, and would go and take a walk - I afterwards missed my watch - this is it - I gave six guineas for it.

            . I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner at Windsor - he said he had pawned the watch for 30s., and sold the duplicate for 6s.; he showed me where it was.

            ; on the 6th of March, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and bought something, but I do not know what; I did not serve him; as he was going out at the shop door, I saw him put his hand, and take the handkerchiefs from behind a wire in the window; I pursued him, and took him with the handkerchiefs upon him; (Produces them;) they have my shop-mark upon them.
The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but delivered a petition, that he might be permitted to transport himself in the service of the East India Company for seven years.

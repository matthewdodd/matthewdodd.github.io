            . I am a carman
, and live in Edgware-road


. On the 19th of April, at night, all my fowls were safe in my hen-house, which is inclosed in the yard. About half-past one o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by my dog barking; I got up, looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner, Bunker, taking the tiles off the hen-house, and killing the fowls and giving them to Kitchener as fast as he killed them - He put them into a bag. I got up,and awoke my neighbour - They ran into the field, we ran after them. In getting over into the field they dropped the bag with nine fowls - A crow-bar laid by the side of it. I followed them to some hay-ricks, went round, and secured them under one of the ricks.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I swear they are the men - I knew them before.

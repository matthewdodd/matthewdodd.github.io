. On the 13th of February, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was behind my counter, and heard a violent tear at the door; I ran out, looked up the passage, and saw the prisoner about half-way up, and the goods on the pavement close by him. On seeing me he ran out, and I caught him just as he turned the corner of a passage- I brought him back, and gave him in charge; a woman picked up the pelisses. They were hanging on the door post.
HYAM HYAMS. I live in Cranbourn-passage. I saw the prisoner walk up and down the passage several times. About half-past ten o'clock he came again, and snatched the pelisses from Mr. Hopps's door; I ran out, he immediately dropped them. Mr. Hopps secured him.

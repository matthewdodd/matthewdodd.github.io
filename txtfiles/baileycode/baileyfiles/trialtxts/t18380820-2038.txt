My fellowservant went out, and was serving his customers on the 23rd of August—he left his loaves in the street—I saw the prisoner walk up to the barrow, and take out two loaves, which were my master's—I ran after him—he threw them down—I called "Stop thief," and a man took him.

Prisoner. I was standing at the corner, another boy took them, and threw them down. Witness. No, there was no other boy near him.

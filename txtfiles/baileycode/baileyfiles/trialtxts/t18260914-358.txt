            . I am street-keeper to the Foundling estate


. On the morning of the 3d of July I saw the prisoners with another person; I followed them, and saw the one who is not here, trying different area gates - each had a basket; I saw Wood go down some areas with one of their baskets, and when he returned he joined them, and returned the basket; they went off the estate; the same afternoon, at two o'clock, I saw them again: Samuel had two baskets, one in the other - they appeared heavy; I went up suddenly, and took Samuel - he scuffled and got from me, and threw the baskets at me; I called Stop thief! and Morley took Samuel - Avery took John; the basket contained the articles stated in the indictment - Samuel said he found them and was going to Hatton-garden.

SPENCER WHITE sworn.
The prisoner lived with me eight or nine months, I am a baker
; on the 4th of April he stole out of my bake-house one quartern loaf, and on the 6th he stole seven, and on the 7th he stole two; I saw him take them each day, I cannot tell what he did with them, he had concealed them over the oven; there is a small hole over the oven, this he made bigger, and in the course of the day he was taking two out; I caught him in the fact; I marked two of them before he took them out.
(Two loaves produced and deposed to.)
Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. It is not at all extraordinary for your man to take the loaves from the bake-house, and carry them into the compting-house? - Yes, quite so; there is a thoroughfare at the back part of the bake-house, which goes into the cow-yard; I have one customer there, he may go to the customers that way.
Whether he was carrying them to the customers or not, you cannot say? - He had no business with that bread.
This young man is of good family and connections? - I have heard of his friends within a day or two, but I know nothing of them.
- MUMFORD sworn.
I apprehended the prisoner.
The prisoner called nine witnesses who all gave him a very good character.

The Prosecutor depos'd, That as he was standing in Fleet-Street, and seeing the Blue Coat Boys pass by, the Prisoner and two others , who were 
               
                  Walter

             and Thomas Molineux, came up to him, and the Prisoner said to them, I charge you take this Man into Custody , charging him with being a Pick-pocket , and they carried him to the Sugar-Loaf


 , and forced him into a Room, and being there, the Prisoner unbuttoned his Breeches , took from him his Money, Handkerchief, and Knife, the other two holding his Hands behind him; and when they had so done, they all ran away, the Handkerchief was afterwards delivered to him again by James.
The Prisoner pleaded, That as they were going along Fleet-Street, Molineux said to him , this is a Day to look out for Pick-pocket , and bid him look out; that he seeing the Prosecutor have his Hand in a Gentleman's Pocket, he apprehended him, and he gave them the Money, &c. so run away from them; but the Jury not giving Credit to the Prisoner's Plea, found him 

               Guilty

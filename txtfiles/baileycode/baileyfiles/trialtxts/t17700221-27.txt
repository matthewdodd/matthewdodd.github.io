            . The prisoner came to my house last Saturday night; he had six-penny worth of brandy and water. I was not in the house when he called for it, but was when he went out; after which a silver spoon was missing: he was seen to have it in his hand. I had him taken up on the Monday morning, and he produced it to the constable in my presence before he was taken before Justice Welch (produced and deposed to); he was not sober.
Job Rogers. I was in the prosecutor's house at the time the prisoner was; I saw him with a bason in one hand and the spoon in the other asking people to drink. I believe him to be in liquor at the time.
Prosecutor. A shoe-black, that was at my door, told me he carried the spoon out publickly in his hand. He denied it at first, but after that he owned it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was in liquor and was quite ignorant of the thing.

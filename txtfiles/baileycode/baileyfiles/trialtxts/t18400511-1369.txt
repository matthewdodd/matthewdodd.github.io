1369. 




JOHN TULLOCK
 and 



EDWARD LYNCH
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
26th of April, 71bs. weight of lead, value 1s. 6d. the goods of 



Henry Mason.






HENRY MASON
. I keep a shop in Broad-street, Ratcliff. On the 26th of April this lead was in my shop—(examining some)—I can take my oath that three of these pieces were there, and I have no doubt the rest of it is mine.





JOHN MASON
. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 26th of April I heard a noise under the counter in the shop—I went and found Tullock under the counter—I asked what he did there—he said he had come for a bag he had left on the Saturday—he was given in charge.





WILLIAM TAPLIN
 (police-constable K 234.) On the evening of the 26th of April the two prisoners passed me on my beat about half-past

eight o'clock—they went on towards the prosecutor's shop—I saw them separate, and Lynch stood at the end of a turning—I was then called in, and they had found Tullock under the counter—I took him, and he had this lead—I took Lynch the next day.

Tullock's Defence. I went to ask for a bag; there was nobody there; I went under the counter, and got my bag.

TULLOCK**—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

LYNCH—


NOT GUILTY

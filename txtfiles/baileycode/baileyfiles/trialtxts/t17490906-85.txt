            . The 23d of July last, I was in More-street, Soho


, being a little in liquor, I went to lie down on a bed where the prisoner Downing lay; he said, you had better take off your cloaths; I took off my coat, and laid myself down with my breeches and stockings on; he got up when I was sleeping, and took away my coat; I never saw my coat since, but here is a pawnbroker, who has got the buttons, which was brought to him by the prisoner Downing; I believe Crosby is innocent of the affair.

            . The 24th of July, Downing and another person came to my shop with 12 silver coat buttons to pawn, I lent him 15 s. upon them; they being in my custody, the prosecutor came to search, and I knowing Mr. Welch, the other person who came with Downing, he directed me where to find him.

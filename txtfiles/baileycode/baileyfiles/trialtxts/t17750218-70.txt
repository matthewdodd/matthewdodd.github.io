            . I carry on the tobacco business



 for 
               
                  Andrew
                   Barlow
               



            , 
               
                  John
                   Wickendon
               



            , 
               
                  William
                   Francis
               



            , and 
               
                  Henry
                   Holland
               



            . On the 26th of January, about four in the afternoon I saw the prisoner take the tobacco from a hogshead on Botolph Wharf


. The hogshead was open for inspection, and to be weighed: it is common to weigh one hogshead in five. I pursued him, and took him immediately; and found two pounds fourteen ounces of tobacco under his coat. I charged a constable with him, and sent him to the Compter.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know no more of the tobacco than I do of my dying day. I was coming along very much in liquor; they laid hold of me; they tore my coat and dragged me to the compter.



               Guilty

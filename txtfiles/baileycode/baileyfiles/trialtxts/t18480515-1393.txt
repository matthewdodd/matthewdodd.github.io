WILLIAM WEAVING.
 I lodge in Church-street, Greenwich. I was walking up Greenwich on 23rd April, about four o'clock in the day—the prisoner came, out his hand to my waistcoat pocket, and took my watch out—it had a gold seal and key attached to it—when he snatched it it fell on the ground—I saw him drop it, and found it there—this is it—(produced.)





WILLIAM STEERS.
 I was at Greernwich fair. I saw the prisoner place his arm over the prosecutor's shoulder, and lar hold of his watch-chain—the watch was in the pocket—I saw the chain in the prisoner's hand.

Prisoner. Q. Was I behind the man? A. At the side of him—I am positive it was you.





GEORGE RICHARDS.
 I was at Greenwich fair on Easter Sunday. I saw the prosecutor turn and accuse the prisoner of stealing his watch—the prisoner denied it, and tried to back away from him—the policeman caught him by the collar, and the prisoner dropped the watch.





THOMAS ARTHUR
 (policeman, R 202.) I caught the prisoner—he made resistance—I saw the watch drop—I could not see from whom.

Prisoner. He first said he saw me drop the watch, and when the Magistrate asked him if he were watching my hands he said no. Witness. I said I saw it fall from his hand—the Magistrate said, "Did you see his hand?"—I said, "No, but it could not come from any one else"—there was no crowd just at that moment—it fell on your left side.

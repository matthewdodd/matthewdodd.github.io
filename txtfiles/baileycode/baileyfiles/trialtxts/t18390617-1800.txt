MOSES LITTLEMORE
. I work on the Regent's Canal, at Paddington, and have a boat there. On the 31st of May, I left it, about six o'clock at night—the cabin was locked, and all the property in it safe—I went to it again about nine o'clock at night, and found the cabin broken open, and the articles stated gone—the prisoner worked on the canal—I have assisted him when he has been out of work—he had no business in my boat—I gave information to the officer—I missed some salt beef and bacon out of the cabin—I have found nothing but my bed—this is it—(looking at it.)





GEORGE M'DONALD

On the morning of the 1st of June the prisoner came to me, with this bed tied up in a sheet, and asked me to let him leave it for a short time—I gave him leave, and he went away—I afterwards gave it to the police, man.





JAMES TAYLOR
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner—he said he knew nothing about this.

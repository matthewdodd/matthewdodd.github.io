             (Police-constable B 95). At half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 4th of May, I saw the prisoner placing these flower-pots in a basket, about forty yards from Mrs. Moore's - I asked how he came by them; he said he bought them in Covent-garden market for 12s.; I secured him, and took the property to Mrs. Moore.

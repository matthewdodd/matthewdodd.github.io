            . I am a merchant's watchman on the kays. I saw the prisoner, on the 12th of December, go to a frail of plumbs several times, and take out the plumbs. I went to him, and took hold of him. He begged me to let him go. The frail was almost empty. The frail held about half a hundred weight.
Q. Does the prisoner work on the kays?
Butler. No, he is nothing but a plunderer on the kays. I had spoke to him to go away several times.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take the plumbs to make any property of them; I only took them to eat.

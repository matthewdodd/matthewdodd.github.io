PETER MELLISH. I am a dyer
, and live in Berner's-street. On the 24th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Long-lane


 - I did not feel my handkerchief taken; the officer told me of it - I then missed it: it was safe ten minutes before. The prisoner was taken about ten yards from me, and my handkerchief produced by another man.

            . I am an officer of Aldersgate Ward. I saw the prisoner in company with two more; I saw the prisoner pass Mr. Mellish, put his hand to his pocket, and, with his two fingers, draw the handkerchief out, and give it to a man who stood by him, with a boy - that man put it up his sleeve. I told Mr. Mellish, who felt and missed it- he followed me; I said, "These are the two - one on the left, and the one on the right has got your handkerchief, and that is the boy who picked your pocket; if you will take him I will take the other;" I went over to the man, and found the handkerchief up his sleeve: I advised the prosecutor to lay hold of the boy (the prisoner) who had picked his pocket, but he seemed flurried, and I gave him the man to hold while I pursued the prisoner, and took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
MR. MELLISH. I let them both go, for I was surprised to see so respectable a man with it.

            . This iron (a crane of a chariot) is my partner's and my property. I know nothing of the prisoner's stealing it from me, but by his confessing to me in New-Prison that he stole it from my shop, and sold it for 3 s. and 6 d. and a pot of beer, to one Backhouse.
Q. What are you?
Butler. I am a coach-maker
. I have the fellow to it at home.


                  William 
                  Baker 
               



            . On the 29th of August, about a quarter after six o'clock, I met the prisoner with this crane, near Holbourn-Bars, about a quarter of a mile from Butler's house.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.



               Guilty
            .

JAMES WEBB. I live with Mr. Smith, in Curzon-street. I had this bag and money on the 23rd of November, and was going through the Almonry


 to go home - the prisoner stood at the door of a house; she took my cap off, and went up stairs with it - she would not give it to me; she then asked me to give her a halfpenny, and I gave her 1d., then another girl at the door asked me for a halfpenny, and I gave her one - on pulling that out my bag of money fell down; the prisoner took it up and ran in doors - I went in and asked her to give it me; she would not - I went and got the Policeman; I had never seen her before - after she got the money she went and brought my cap down and gave it to me.

            . The prosecutor came and told me of this case - I went to the house, and found the prisoner in the parlour playing at cards with another girl and a man; I charged her with robbing the boy
 - she said she knew nothing about it; I searched her and the place, but found nothing - the prosecutor went with me.
Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the boy nor the money.

            . I am a pauper in the workhouse, of All Saints, Poplar - the prisoner was a pauper
 there; he ran away on the 19th of January. On the 21st, betweensix and seven o'clock in the evening I saw him up stairs in No. 1 Ward, which is a sleeping-room, taking the blankets off the bed, and folding them up - I took him into custody. He got into the room, by putting a plank across the shore, and getting in the back way - it was a heavy plank, and would take two men to carry it.

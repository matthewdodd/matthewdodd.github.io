             depos'd, that coming by Brewer's Key Gate-way


, he saw 2 Men taking Tobacco out of their Cloaths, and putting it into a Shirt, upon which he call'd the Watch; that he 2 Men then ran away, and left the Shirt and Tobacco behind'em. That he, this Evidence, followed and stopt the Prisoner, and found 2 Hands of Tobacco in his Coat but that the other Man got off. And that he believed the Tobacco found on the Prisoner was the Prosecutor's Goods because they afterwards found the Prosecutor's Hogshead cut with a Knife. The Constable and Watchmen confirm'd the former Evidence, and the Shirt and Tobacco was produc'd in Court. The Prisoner in his Defence said he met a Man who desired him to help him carry the Tobacco, and that he thereupon lent him his Shirt to put it in; but bringing no body to prove it, the Jury found him 

               guilty
            .

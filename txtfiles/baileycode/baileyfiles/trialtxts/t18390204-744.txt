GEORGE ANTHONY
. I am a writer—on the 11th of January I saw the two prisoners together, about eleven o'clock in the morning, in Whitcombe-street—I

watched them for about five minutes, and about half-past one o'clock I met them in Grafton-street—I then saw that Johnston had got Pitman's apron with something in it—I followed him to the private door of Mr. Wadmore, a pawnbroker (Pitman was on the other side of the way)—I went in at the shop door, and told the shopkeeper—he produced this caddy to me—I said, "That has been stolen; detain it and the party"—I got a policeman and sent him to the shop—I followed Pitman down Tottenham Court-road, where he was taken.





HENRY KILSSY
. I live in Tottenham Court-road—I am a pawnbroker—Johnston offered me this caddy—the witness told me to detain him.





WILLIAM TRINDER
. I live in Whitcombe-street—this is my caddy, and was on a table in my shop, which is open-fronted.

Pitman. It was outside instead of in.

Johnston's Defence. We were out of work, and forced to sleep in the street two nights before this, and seeing this outside we were tempted to take it—we had nothing to eat.





WILLIAM LANE
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of Pitman's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read—) I was at the trial—he is the man.

PITMAN—

On the 28th of April the prisoner came in, and asked the price of my eggs; I remembered him, and kept my eye upon him - he pretended to be tipsy: I noticed how many pieces of pork I had in my shop; hebought 6 d. worth of eggs, and one of his companions, who was at the door, called out, "Jack, have a bit of bacon with your eggs;" I took the knife, and asked what part of bacon he would like - while I turned he ran out; I followed, and took him with a piece of pork, which he threw down.
Prisoner. I had my hands full of eggs, and could not have taken the pork. Witness. I saw him throw the pork down; I made him pick it up, and bring it back again. The eggs were in his bosom and his left hand.

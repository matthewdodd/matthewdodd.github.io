JOHN SHEPHERD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
8th of June, 26 yards of linen cloth, value 2l., the goods, of 



Jeremiah Rotherham, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS PARKER LOVEGROVE
. I live in Shoreditch, and am a licensed victualler. I was coming out of my house on the 8th of June, and stopped the prisoner in my passage, with a parcel under his right arm—I said, "You scoundrel, why do you come running through my house in this manner?"—I turned him round, and this parcel dropped from him—I seized him by the collar, stooped and picked the cloth up—he said, "I will go back"—I said, "You shall not go back, you shall go with me"—my next door neighbour's shopman told me to take him to Mr. Rotherham—I took him there, and the cloth—Mr. Rotherham identified it—the prisoner said nothing.

Prisoner, He says I had the parcel under my arm? Witness. Yes; there was no other person in the passage between you and me—I swear I saw it under your arm—I saw it drop—I was on the passage side—no person came up to you and then ran away.





JEREMIAH ROTHERHAM
. I am a linen-draper, and live three or four doors from the last witness. This linen was brought to me by him and the prisoner—I can swear it is mine—I missed such a piece—I saw it safe half an hour before.





HENRY BERESPORD
 (police-sergeant G 8.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clarke (read)—I was the officer who took him, and know him to be the man.

Prisoner's Defence, I went through this person's house—the door was pushed against me—a person with a blue coat ran violently past me—the witness took me into his house—he then took me out again—he saw this cloth, and said, "You have dropped this"—I said, "No; I beg your pardon, I never saw it before. "




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

MARY COSTELLY
. I am the wife of John Costelly, of Sussex-place, Cromer-street. The prisoner was employed to take care of my children—she lodged with me, had her board, and 1s. 6d. a week—on the 13th of December, I gave her a table-cloth to wash—I have seen it since at the pawnbroker's—this is it—I missed this counterpane, this frock, and other things—they are mine—I asked the prisoner if she knew any thing about

them—she said, "No"—I asked her again—she said if I would give her time, they would not be lost—I asked her where they were, what had become of them, and if she had given them to any body—she said, "No"—I asked if she had pawned them—she said she had—I asked her to show me the tickets—she said she could not, but she could get the things by giving an oath, for she had destroyed the tick eta—I gave her in charge.

Prisoner. I said I had lost the tickets, not that I had destroyed them—she promised me forgiveness if I would tell her. Witness. No further than that if she put the tickets down, I would not expose her, nor give her into custody, but get the things out as I could.





BENJAMIN KITCHEN
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker. I produce this counterpane, table-cloth, and all these articles—I took them in of a woman in the name of Ann Price—I do not remember who I took them of—Mr. Cordwell took in the counterpane, but he is not here—he is ill.





HENRY MARTON BURTON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—I know she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 54.—


Transported for Seven Years.

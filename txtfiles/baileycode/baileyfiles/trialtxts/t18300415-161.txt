            . I missed my pocketbook on Saturday evening, the 27th of March; I cannot swear to having seen it since the evening of the previous Wednesday, when I returned it to my pocket - I think if it had not been in my pocket I should have missed it; the officer brought it to me about nine o'clock, and it contained this silver pencil-case, some papers, and writings of mine; this is it - I reside with my father, in East India-buildings, Houndsditch.

            . About five o'clock on the Saturday evening, I saw the prisoner and two others following the prosecutor - I followed them, and saw the prisoner take the book from the prosecutor's pocket, and try to conceal it in his trousers; I seized him, and forced him into a shop - I found the prosecutor's residence by a bill that was in book.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a bill up for a light porter - I went to the place, and in coming out I saw the book; I took it up, and the constable took me into a shop.

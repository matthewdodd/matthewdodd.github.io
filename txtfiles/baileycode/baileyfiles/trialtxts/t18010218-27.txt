GEORGE SIMCOCK sworn. - I keep the Bolt-and-Tun Inn-yard
: On the 27th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was going through Fleet-street


, near Serjeant's-inn, towards the Bolt-and-Tun, I felt something touch my thigh; I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner close to me; I said, you scoundrel, you have picked my pocket; I took him by the collar with one hand, and with the other took the handkerchief from under his right arm, under his jacket, he was not two inches from me; this is the handkerchief, (produces it); I took him to the Compter myself.
Prisoner's defence. I have been at sea six years past; I was going through Fleet-street, and saw this handkerchief laying upon the ground; as soon as I had picked it up, the gentleman laid hold of me, and said, I had robbed him; I am as innocent as the child unborn.

            , aged 24.




               Transported for seven years

EPHRAIM BOLLAND
 and 




MATTHEW DEAR
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
6th of October, 7 fowls, price 10s. the goods of 



John Moore.






HANNAH MOORE
. I am the wife of John Moore, a farmer, at Harefield, in Middlesex., We lost some fowls—the constable brought one to me, which had been recently killed, and it is mine—I have not seen the rest—I saw the prisoners in custody.





JOHN LARKIN
. I am a constable at Ickenhara, in Middlesex. I was turning from Uxbridge, on Saturday, on horseback, and met the prisoners in the High-road, between 300 and 400 yards from Moore's house—Holland's hands were bloody, and his jacket also—I said, "Bolland, I suspect you have something in your pocket which does not belong to you—I shall search you"—he immediately slipped by my horse, jumped over the rails and ran away—I took Dear, and a fowl fell from his breast—he said he had picked it up down by the hill—I took him to the cage, and took the fowl to Mrs. Moore—Bolland's pockets were swollen out—he escaped—I sent a note to give information at Uxbridge, and he was taken that evening.






CHARLES MURRAY
. I am a constable of Uxbridge. I apprehended Bolland in consequence of receiving a note from Larkin, in Uxbridge between six and seven o'clock the same evening—I searched him, and found nothing on him—he changed his clothes between Saturday and Monday when he was taken before the Magistrate.

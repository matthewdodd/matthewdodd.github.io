            . I am the wife of George Benjamin Poole of Charlotte-street, Somers'-town


. I let a back room furnished to the prisoner on the 1st of February. On the 22d of March she dined with me, and when we had done dinner I put some things away; she took the table-cloth and shook it in the ashes, and I saw no more of it; the next morning I could not find it - the prisoner was out, but when she came home I said "Where did you put the table-cloth?" she said "I don't know that I had it;" I said "Yes, you had" she said "I put it on the bed;" I said "No, I have searched the room all over:" she turned the conversation, and I said no more; but on the 25th I went into her room with a constable, and missed a pair of sheets from the bed.

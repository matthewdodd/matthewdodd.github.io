             sworn.
The prisoner came into our shop near ten o'clock in the morning, the 26th of March, and asked to look at ribbons; I shewed her some; she said she liked none of them, and I turned to put the ribbons into the drawer, and heard a stocking paper move; I turned round immediately, and saw her whip a parcel under her arm which I was certain she must have taken off the shelf; I halloo'd to her, you thief, you have taken that parcel; upon which she set off; I went out and cried stop thief; she was soon stopped and brought to the door, with the parcel; she never was out of my sight.

             sworn.
I was going past the shop at the same time, and this girl was coming out of the shop, and Mrs. Gibson came out and said, stop thief, and I saw the prisoner throw down a bundle.
(The stockings produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner. She said, if I had ten necks she would hang me.

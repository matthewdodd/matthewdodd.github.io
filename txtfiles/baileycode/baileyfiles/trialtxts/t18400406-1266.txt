THOMAS TAYLOR
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
6th of April, 3 loaves of bread, value 7d., the goods of 



George Beland; and that Hoefler and Taylor had been before convicted of felony.






MARTHA BELAND
. I am the wife of George Beland, and live in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel. About half-past one o'clock, on the 6th of April, I was in my parlour—I heard a rustling at the window, Bowden called me—I went out, and missed three loaves—I ran down Nottinghamplace, and saw the three prisoners running—Dudley delivered some loaves to the other two—he was then secured—he said he had done nothing—I said, "Come back, I will see what you have done"—Hoefler and Taylor got off at that time.





ANDREW BOWDEN
. I live in Duke-street. I was in Charlotte-street, near the prosecutor's window—I saw Hoefler open the window, and each

of the prisoners take a loaf—I went and told—MRS. Beland overtook them—they hid the bread—I am sure I saw them each take a loaf.





ROBERT MIDDLETON
 (police-constable K 216.) I took the prisoners—I do not know what became of the bread.

Hoefler's Defence. I was in Whitechapel about ten o'clock that evening, and they took me.

 (police-constable H 180.) I produce a certificate of Hoefler's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—Hoefler is the person.

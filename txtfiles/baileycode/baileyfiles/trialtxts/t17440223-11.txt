            . The Prisoner took this piece of cloth out of my master's shop in Holborn


, I saw her drop it from under her clothes.
Q. Did she take it in the shop, or out of the shop?
Miles. She took it out of the shop, without coming into the shop. Mr. Matthias's maid-servant saw the Prisoner peep into the shop, as she supposed to see if any body was there to observe her, and saw her take it out of the shop window; then she went to call her master, who was in the neighbourhood, and met the Prisoner with it under her apron. 


               Guilty of single Felony to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

JOHN DAVIS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
8th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Hugh Harding, from his person.






HUGH HARDING
. I live at Chelsea. On Wednesday evening, about eight o'clock or half-past, I was walking with my brother and his wife, three or four hundred yards over London Bridge, towards the City—a gentleman tapped Mrs. Harding on the shoulder and said, "That gentleman has lost his handkerchief, and that boy has got it"—I let go of my wife's arm, and followed the prisoner and another boy, who were together, and took them both—I gave one in charge of my brother and we took both to the station-house—the prisoner said there that he had no handkerchief at all, and never saw it—the policeman found it under his jacket, behind his back—it was taken from my coat pocket.





JOHN HUMPHREY
. I am a Ward constable. The prisoner was given into my custody—I found the handkerchief up his back, between his shirt and waistcoat—I had them both in custody, but was knocked down by a gang, and the other escaped.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked the handkerchief up, which was lying by the side of the road.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

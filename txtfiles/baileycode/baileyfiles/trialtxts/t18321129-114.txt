            , of Beech-street


, linen-draper
. On the night of the 31st of October I was in the shop; some person came and stole five handkerchiefs from the door, and in about ten minutes a person came, and cut a square of glass - I was waiting for him when the prisoner came near the door, and tore down a cloak that was pinned up to a box, between the door of the shop and the lobby -I ran out, overtook him, and brought him back; I am sure he is the person; he had got thirty or forty yards - there was only him running - I only lost sight of him while he was turning from the door - he gave the cloak to his companion.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner.
JURY to WILLIAM CHARLESWORTH. Q. Can you swear positively that the prisoner is the lad who took the cloak? A. Yes; I saw him go up the steps, come into the lobby, and take it down; I had to come round the counter to pursue him.

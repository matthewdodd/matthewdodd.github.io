ELIZABETH ROBERTS
. I am a widow, and keep a tobacconist's shop, in Paul-street, Finsbury. On the evening of the 21st of October a box of cigars was taken from my counter, but I did not see it—this is my box and my cigars—(looking at them.)





JAMES CLIFFORD
. On the 21st of October, a little before eight o'clock, in the evening, I was passing Mrs. Roberts's shop, and saw the prisoner standing by the counter, looking towards the parlour-door—I watched him two or three minutes and saw him take a box of cigars off the counter, and pot it into his apron—he came out—I let him get about two yards, and then took him.

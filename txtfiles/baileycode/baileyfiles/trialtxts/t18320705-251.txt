            . I went to the review in Hyde-park


, on the 26th of June - I was standing against the rails, and felt something move my pocket; I turned, and caught the prisoner, who was close to me, by the coat; he ran - I followed him, and cried thief! I caught and held him till he put his hand into his side pocket, and gave my watch into my hand - this is it; it had been in my right-hand pocket; I gave him into custody.

             (Police-constable D3). I took the prisoner - he said, "You are quite mistaken;" I took him to the lodge - he then said, "I am sorry for what I have done, I hope you will look over it - I have lately been married."

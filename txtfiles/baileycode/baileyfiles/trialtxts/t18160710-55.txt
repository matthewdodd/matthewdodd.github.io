. The prisoner at the bar was a servant
 of mine. About one o'clock in the morning of the 5th of June, I marked all the money in my till; there were three-shilling pieces, eighteen-penny pieces, and I believe some shillings; there were about three pounds in silver all together; I carefully locked the till, and took the key away with me. I then retired to bed. I was the last person up in the house. In the morning I missed the quantity of silver in question. I found the till unlocked, and I found a mark as if a knife or something of that kind had been put in to slip the lock back. I had all my servants searched; but nothing was found on them. I sent for an officer, who accompanied my eldest daughter up stairs, and they will describe what they saw.
WILLIAM CLEMENTS. I am a constable, and I found the money in question at the bottom of the prisoner's box.

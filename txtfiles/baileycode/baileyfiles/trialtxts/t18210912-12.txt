            . I live at Woodford, in Essex. On the 10th of September, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was at the top of Fish-street-hill


, looking at the ruins of the fire, my handkerchief was safe ten minutes before; a constable came up, and I missed it; he had hold of the prisoner, and produced it - I saw him take it from the prisoner.

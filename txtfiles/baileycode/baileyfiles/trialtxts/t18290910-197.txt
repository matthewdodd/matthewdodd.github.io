            . I am a street-keeper. I was on duty at the Seven-dials


, on the 19th of July, at a quarter-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket - there was another person just behind him, and as I was following the prisoner the other turned back; I said to him,"Old man, it will not do;" the prisoner then turned back, and I pursued him up Little Andrew-street - as soon as I caught him he took this handkerchief from his hind pocket, and dropped it down; I did lose sight of him, but not for more than half a moment - I had seen him before, and swear he is the man; the gentleman came and said it was his handkerchief - I wanted him to go to the office; he took out his watch, and said he was rather behind time, and would meet me in the evening, but he did not come.

            . I was with the witness, and saw the handkerchief taken - he threw it down; the gentleman owned it in the prisoner's presence - the prisoner said he did not take it.
Prisoner's Defence. I never had it - I was in deep distress, walking along; there was a cry of Stop thief! and I ran - there was a mob round, and this handkerchief laid on the ground.

            ; his timber was rafted at Blackwall, near Foley House




. All the cargo of the Seven Brothers ship had been rafted there for twelve months. It is marked S X B. on the side, and at the end we put B. K. On the 11th of November, about 10 o'clock, I missed five pieces, which had been secured in the usual way; the ropes were cut with a rope. I have seen it since, and know it.

            . I am a waterman. On Saturday morning, the 10th of November, about half-past 8 o'clock, Fletcher employed me at Ratcliff-cross-stairs; he said he wanted me to fetch some timber from Blackwall. I rowed him by the Foley House, and stopped there an hour and a half, till the water floated the timber, he then shoved five pieces out; we rowed them up to Jessop's Wharf, and got there between two and three o'clock in the morning; he told me to call next morning on Jessop, who paid me.

            . I am a Thames police surveyor. On the 29th of November I went to Mr. Hand's premises, Dog-row, Bethnall-green. Dunkley is a lath render and wood-cutter, and said he rented the premises. I found four whole pieces of timber and three lengths, which appeared to have been cut from one piece, and marked S X B. and B K.; he said he bought them of Fletcher, and produced the bill and receipt. The prosecutor claimed it. Fletcher was in custody, and admitted selling it to him.

            . I am a publican, and have a wharf. On the 10th of November, in the afternoon, Fletcher came and asked me to pay the waterman for bringing the timber to my wharf, if it came: next morning I found it there, and paid the waterman. On Monday, Dunkley came to me and said he would buy it. Fletcher came soon after, and he paid him at the rate of 3 l. a load for it.
MR. BROCKELBANK. It was worth 3 l. 10 s. a load; four months credit.

Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGRAST. Q. You did not see Cias with him? - A. He was paid 4 s. as the waterman. He brought me a note from Fletcher to pay him; that was under his fare; and he came on Monday for a piece of rope which was attached to the timber, as being his.

On the 25th November, Fletcher came and asked if I wanted to buy any timber, and asked me to go and see it; I said, no: as it was Sunday; but I would meet him at Jessop's at six in the morning. I did not go, and between seven and eight he came and knocked me up. I went, and agreed for four pieces at 2 l. 15 s. a load, and 2 s. wharfage.

            . I live in David-street, Berkley-square


, with Mr. Jaques, a coach-maker
. On the 14th of April I brought 2 shirts, a pair of stockings, and a dimity night-cap, tied up in a silk handkerchief to our shop, and laid them on my box under the bench; I missed them on the 17th at night; the prisoner worked in the shop; I heard he had but an indifferent character; I laid the fellow handkerchief to that loose on the bench, in order to find out the thief, on the Thursday night; and on the Sunday the prisoner came in and went up stairs, and came down again; after which, my handkerchief was missing.

                  Hammond 
               



             the apprentice was at watch, who came and told me he saw the prisoner take it: we went a little way with the prisoner and took him into a public-house, and charged him with it; he took it out of his pocket and delivered it to me; he said he took it to wear that day, and intended to return it again: he was taken to the Round-house and searched, and one ring and 5 bolts and nuts were found upon him; then we went to his lodgings, and there we found 2 more rings, they are called poll rings, used in coach-making; (the handkerchiefs produced and deposed to) he never would own to the taking any of my other things.

                  Jaques 
               



            . I am a coach-maker; the prisoner was my servant as a labourer
; when the things were found, the prisoner was taken before Justice Wright; there he owned in my hearing he had taken these 3 rings, and 2 more from me, and sold the 3 to the man that made them.
Q. What are they worth?
Jaques. They cost me 15 d. a piece.

                  Hammond 
               



            . I am apprentice to Mr. Jaques; I was hid on purpose to watch the prisoner: I saw him take some poll rings out of a drawer on the Saturday night, and on the Sunday morning, I saw him take Mears's handkerchief.


                  Gilbert 
                  Silliocke 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Jaques; the prisoner was hired as a labourer, and had been there 10 days. On the 16th of April, I was told, Mears missed his things; we enquired, but could hear nothing of them: we suspected the prisoner: we laid a scheme to catch him. I sent him up stairs to where the poll rings were; Hammond was above, he came down and said, he saw the prisoner take a ring out of the drawer, and after that he said, he saw him take Mears's handkerchief: I was by when he was searched, and saw a poll ring, 5 bolts, and the silk handkerchief found upon him: I heard him own before the Justice, he had taken and sold some rings in Newtoner's-lane.
The prisoner in his defence said, he had been to do a job to a coach, and he put the rings and bolts in his pocket to have of different sizes to fit, and he had forgot to take them out of his pocket when he returned; but upon Silliocke being asked about it, he said, the prisoner was only employed as a labourer, and not in the coach-making way. He called 
               
                  John 
                  Reed 
               



             and 
               
                  William 
                  Simdon 
               



            , who said, they never heard any ill of him.



               Guilty of stealing the rings, bolts, and one handkerchief
            .

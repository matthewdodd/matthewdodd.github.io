            . I am a brewer
; the prisoner was in my service, and received money for me, which he should pay me as soon as he came home; he had a book to enter the day's proceedings - here is the book; he has entered some cash as received on the 2d of June, but not 6s. as received from Black - he has never paid me that 6s.

            . I gave my servant 6s. to pay the prisoner on his master's account, the beginning of June.

            . I am servant to Mr. Black. On the 2d of June, I gave the prisoner 6s. he gave me.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he believed he had paid his master every thing he had received, and if not it must arise from error.

               Transported for Fourteen Years

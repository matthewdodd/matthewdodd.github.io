HECTOR AUDLIN
 (through an interpreter.) I am a poulterer, and live in Grafton-street, Soho. On the evening of the 31st of December I was in a house opposite my shop—I saw the prisoner take a goose, wrap it up in his apron, and go away with it—it was on a board inside the shop—I went after him, and took him with the goose in his apron.





ANDREW VALLANCE
 (police-sergeant C 11.) The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody, with a dead goose—here are the feet of it.

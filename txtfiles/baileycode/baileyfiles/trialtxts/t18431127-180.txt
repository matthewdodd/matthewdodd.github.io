HENRY CARTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of Nov., one copper, value 14s.; the goods of 



George Towgood, fixed to a building.






JOSEPH ZAPHNATH PARNEAH DIXON
, of Bedborough-place, St. Pancras. At about half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 6th of Nov. I was knocked up by a lad—I jumped up, went down, and found the prisoner and another in the water-closet—the copper was seven yards from the water-closet—it belongs to George Towgood—after I took the prisoner to the station, I examined the doors of Mr. Towgood's wash-house—it appeared that the half-door bad been opened, but not forced—one of the binges had been broken some time before—it did not appear to have been bolted.





JOHN DUNCAN
. Between seven and eight o'clock that morning I was at the window, and saw the prisoner getting along the wall—I told my mother—I saw him go into the wash-house—I went to the bottom of the court, and as I was coming back I saw a black hand put out and pull the door to—then my mother told me to go to Mr. Dixon, and while I was doing so the prisoner got out of the wash-house into the water-closet—he laid the copper down in the wash-house—I saw his hands were black and sooty.





WILLIAM FREEMAN
. I am agent to Mr. George Towgood—there ought to be a copper in the washhouse—it was fixed—I have not examined it very lately.





CHARLES HART
 (police-constable 99 E.) I have examined this copper with the place where it had been fixed—I was on duty that night—I examined

the wash-house, and saw the copper safe in its place, through a broken pane of glass—it was safe early that morning—the prisoner's browsers were smutty.

Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing to do with it.




GUILTY
. * Aged 17.—


Transported Seven Years.

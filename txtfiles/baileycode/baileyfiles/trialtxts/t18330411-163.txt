WILLIAM LOCKE. I live at No. 15, Featherstone-street. On the evening of the 20th of February I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, take the desk, put it on his head, and walk out - I asked the prosecutor's wife if she had sold it; she said, No - I then took the prisoner, and brought him back; he said, "What am I to do? I must live some how."
Prisoner. It is false to say I went into the shop; a man told me to carry it.
BENJAMIN ROBERTS (Police-constable G 223). I took the prisoner, and have the desk.
THOMAS WHITLEY. This is my desk; it was safe in my shop that day.

ROBERT GINGELL. On the 23d of June, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was at the top of Strutton-ground, Westminster


; the prisoner came up and took my watch from my pocket - she ran off with it. I swear she is the person - it has not been found.

            . I was in the street and saw the prisoner take the watch. I followed and took hold of her, but was immediately knocked down - the watchman came up and secured her.

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor about half-past nine o'clock - she asked me to go and have something to drink. I took him to the Half-moon, public-house, and had three glasses of rum; he said, "Take my watch and wind it up." I said, I did not like; he then took it from his fob, and put it into my hand; he and this witness came out with me. I had my shawl taken off my shoulders and was knocked down - the prosecutor was tipsy.

            . She was not knocked down - I was knocked down by some persons who she called, and they took the watch from her hand, without any violence; she took it out of Gingell's fob, while I was supporting him - he was tipsy.

            . I know the prosecutor's shop - he is a baker
 - a bird and cage hung in front of his house on the 2nd of June - I saw the prisoner go and take it as I wasstanding at my father's door - I had not known him before - there was another person with him - the prisoner tied two sticks together and took the cage - he lowered it down, and the other took it - they watched the policeman's back being turned - it was just after four o'clock in the morning.
Prisoner. Q. When I came to you, the night I was taken, what did you say? A. I said I did not know you, but I would see in the morning; and when I saw you in the morning, I was sure it was you.

             (police-constable H 32). I received information, but could not find the prisoner till the 19th of June, when I met him with these two sticks. I took him to Allen, who said, "I do not know you now," but in the morning he knew him - the bird and cage have not been found.
FREDERICK WILLIAM BUTLER. I had a linnet in a cage, which I have lost.
Prisoner. Q. How high was your bird? A. Over the window, about ten feet from the ground.
Prisoner. Was not that enough to make any body a thief? I was going down the Hackney-road, when I was taken - the Lord above is my protector.

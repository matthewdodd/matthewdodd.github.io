            . I am a watchman
 to a brewhouse, upon Mill-bank


. The prisoner came into the watch-house to warm herself, and was not willing to go out again: I went out, and was not gone above five minutes, but she and the things mentioned, which were tied in a bundle, were gone. The next day, about 12 o'clock, I found her drunk in bed, and some of my watch-house candles lying in the window; and the handkerchief which my things were in, was tied about her neck (Produced and deposed to.) After she was committed to the Gate-house, I told her I would not appear against her, if she would tell me where my things were; she said, they were at a pawnbrokers, pawned in the name of

WILLIAM BEESON
 and 




WILLIAM LONG
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
8th of February, 1 pair of shoes, value 2s., the goods of 



Henry Emanuel; and that Beeson had been before convicted of felony.






SOPHIA CHAPPELL
. I live with my father and mother, in Baldwin's-gardens. About three o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoners near Mr. Emanuel's shop—they were strangers to me—Beeson took the shoes off the board and put them under his jacket—the other prisoner was by him—they both walked away together, and then ran—I heard Mary Emanuel inquiring about the shoes—I went and told her, and she ran after them—Beeson was brought back—Long was taken on the Sunday morning—I am sure he is the same boy.





MARY EMAMUEL
. I am the daughter of Henry Emanuel. Chappell informed me how the shoes had been taken—I went to look for the prisoners,

but could not see any thing of them tilt Hall brought the shoes to me for sale on the Wednesday, and I claimed them—Beeson was taken that day.





DAVID HALL
. I work for Beeson's father, who is a shoemaker in Red Lion-street. Long gave me a pair of shoes, and told me to go and sell them—he did not tell me where, and I went to Mr. Emanuel's, where they were taken from, but I did not know it.





HENRY STRATER
. I am a policeman. I apprehended Beeson about four o'clock on the Wednesday, and Long on the Sunday following.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





HENRY STRATER
. I got this certificate of Beeson's former conviction from the Sessions-house, on Clerkenwell-green (read)—I was present at his trial—he is the person who was convicted.

BEESON—

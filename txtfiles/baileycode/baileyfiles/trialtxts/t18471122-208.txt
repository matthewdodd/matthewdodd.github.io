208. 




HENRY FORT



, embezzling 5l., the moneys of 



William Harris, his master; having been before convicted of felony.






Prisoner. I am guilty of this offence, but not of having been before convicted.






JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (policeman, T 62.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted, June, 1842, transported for ten years)—the prisoner is the man—I have not the least doubt of him—I picked him out in the yard—I told him he had a wen on his throat, and pulled down his handkerchief and found it.

Prisoner. I am not the man; when the Deputy-Governor called me out, you said I was the man. Witness. He did not call you out.


GUILTY. Aged 25—


Transported for Seven Years.

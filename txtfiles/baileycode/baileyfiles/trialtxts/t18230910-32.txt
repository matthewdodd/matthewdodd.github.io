            . I live in Castle-street, Holborn, and am a wine merchant
. On the 2d of September, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the end of Carey-street, Chancery-lane


, and found the prisoner three or four times at my pocket, but did not speak to him - he was in company with two others, about his own age. He took my handkerchief from my pocket, and I saw him put it behind him, to his companion. I immediately seized him, and his companion picked the handkerchief off the ground, and seeing that I noticed him he handed it to me. I took the prisoner into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. Three boys were behind me - one of them gave me a push; then took the gentleman's handkerchief, and dropped it. The gentleman collared me because I was near.

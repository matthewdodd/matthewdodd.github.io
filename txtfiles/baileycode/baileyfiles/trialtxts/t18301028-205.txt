. The prisoner and another man came into the shop with a petition for relief on behalf of somebody else; I told them I was not the master - the boots hung on the front of the counter, about two yards within the door; when they left I suspected something, and missed these boots - I rang for somebody to mind the shop, then followed, and caught sight of the other man; I saw the prisoner, who had gone out first, join him, and when they had got farther I saw the prisoner take something from under his frock, and put it into a handkerchief - they went into Smith's wine-vaults; I got an officer, and we found the boots in a handkerchief, under the prisoner's arm.

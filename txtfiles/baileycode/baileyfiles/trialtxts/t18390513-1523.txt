JOHN BENT
. I was at Paddington on the 4th of May, between two and three o'clock. I had a handkerchief, and a snuff-box—I believe they were both in the same pocket—I did not feel them taken, but I was told my pocket had been picked—I then felt, and my handkerchief and box were gone—this is my handkerchief and box—(looking at them)—I had not seen the prisoner near me.





WILLIAM HORSFORD
. I am constable of the Mendicity Society. I was

at Paddington at half-past two o'clock—I saw the prisoner go behind the prosecutor, lift up his coat, and take this handkerchief out—he put it under his jacket, and ran up the Edgware-road—I pursued him—he threw it down on the pavement—I took it up and pursued him to John-street—I called "Stop thief"—he stopped, and I gave-him to the policeman—I sent for the prosecutor, and when we got to the station-house, the police man had got this snuff-box, which some one had picked up from an area which the prisoner had passed.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

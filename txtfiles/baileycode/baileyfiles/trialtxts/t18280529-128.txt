            . On the 25th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Church-street, Bethnal-green, and saw the two prisoners carrying this boiler; I asked what they were about - they said they brought it from Hackney, and then said they picked it up in Bishop Bonner's-field - I believe one of them said the other had employed him, but I do not know which; I took hold of Baker, and before the other officer could take Abbot he darted off - Baker said he was very glad he was taken, and he hoped he should get transported, he should have a home then; I saw Abbot afterwards and he made another escape - I took him at last on the 5th of May, by the side of the canal.

. The officer called on me - I looked and missed this boiler and another; I know this is mine.

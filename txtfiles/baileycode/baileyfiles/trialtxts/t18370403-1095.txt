ANN LEE
. I am single. I lodge in the first floor at No. 1, Churchplace, Islington—Edward Benbow lodges there—he went out on the 21st of March, at ten o'clock in the morning, and asked me to mind his room—I remained in the parlour to take care of it—the prisoner came there in the evening to see his uncle, as he said—Benbow is his uncle—I had seen him before—he did not stay there above ten minutes—I never left the parlour—I missed a waistcoat when he was gone, at half-past five o'clock.

Printer. Q. Did you see it in the room when I came in? A. It was there before you came in—I saw it about half-past five o'clock.





HECTOR ESSEX
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Upper-street, Islington. This waistcoat was pawned, on the 21st of March, by the prisoner.





EDWARD BEMBOW
. The prisoner is my nephew—this is my waistcoat—when I went out I know it was safe—I never permitted him to take it.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear it was not in your coat when you put it on? A. Yes, I will.

Prisoner's Defence. I found it on the steps in Church-passage, and put it into my pocket—I went to my uncle's—he was not at home—I picked it up by the railings—I staid ten minutes—I was not aware that it was his.




GUILTY
*. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

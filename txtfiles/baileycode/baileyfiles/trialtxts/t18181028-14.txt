 - I do not know what parish my house is in. On the 22d of July, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I missed my watch from my bed-room. I got up at five o'clock in the morning-it was then safe; the prisoner was in my employ. About one o'clock I found the watch in pledge. There was a seal and chain to it when I lost it. It cost me 2l. 15s. five years ago.

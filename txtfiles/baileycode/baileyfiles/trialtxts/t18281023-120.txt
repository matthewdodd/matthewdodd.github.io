ROBERT DONALDSON. I am an upholsterer
, and live in Rathbone-place


. On the 15th of September, about two or three o'clock, I missed a mahogany dumb-waiter from my door; I had seen it about ten o'clock that day - I made inquiries, and told the porters to look about; I received information that there was such an article at the door of a shop opposite the reservoir - I went there, and got it.

            . I am a broker. I bought the dumb waiter of the prisoner; I cannot tell on what day, but it was four days before the prosecutor owned it; I had some slight knowledge of his person, his brother being a broker - he said it was his brother's.

            . I went to Mr. Marshall's on the 13th of October, and there I found the prisoner offering another article for sale; I took him to the watch-house - he said the waiter belonged to his brother.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not steal it from the door. I called at a public-house; a porter came in and said, "I have got an article to dispose of, which I bought where I was in possession, and it was not down in the inventory;" I said I would try to sell it for him - I went to Mr. Marshall's, and sold it him - I brought the money to the man, who gave me 1s.
ROBERT DONALDSON re-examined. Q. When did you loose it? A. On the 15th, and on the 18th I went to the shop, and saw it, I told him if he should see the man, I would prosecute him.

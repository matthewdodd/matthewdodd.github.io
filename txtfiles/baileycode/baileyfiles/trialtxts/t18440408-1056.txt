1056. 




CHARLES MEAD
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 heifer, price 10l.; the property of 



George Pavitt.


MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






GEORGE PAVITT, FARMER
, Bobbingsworth, Essex, I had a heifer, safe on the 1st of March—I kept it in a field, about a quarter of a mile from my house, and twenty-one miles from Whitechapel—I saw it safe between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I saw it next on the 27th, at Barnet cattle-fair, in possession of Mr. Debnam.





CHARLES WATKINS
, butcher, No. 67, Whitechapel market. On the 2nd of March I bought the heifer of the prisoner, about five o'clock in the evening—it was tied up with some others—I did not perceive it had been driven then—I gave 3l. 5s. for it, which was its value, for killing—I asked him where it came from—he said he had bought it at a sale, with two other cows at Brent wood—he did not say when—I did not kill her—I sent, her to Smith-field market on the Monday, and it was sold by Mr. Cope salesman to Nicholls, for 5l. 10s.


COURT. Q. Was not 3l. 5s. a very short price? A. It was the value for killing, but on Monday morning I found it was in calf and it would be of more value to a grazier than to kill.





WILLIAM NICHOLLS
. I am a drover and jobber. I bought the heifer for Mr. Debnam, for 5l. 10s., in Watkins's presence—I took it down to Barnet, where Mr. Pavitt saw it—after buying it, I found it was not worth 50s., from having been so overdriven—in fact she will never recover—I was nine hours getting her nearly ten miles.

Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Mann said I might bring anything I liked to his place, and because I would not sell this cow for what he wanted, he has made this up; he has got a few more cows which he hat got wrong. I had them to sell, not for myself; the cow was brought to the Three Mackerel and Bell, for me to sell.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Ten Years.

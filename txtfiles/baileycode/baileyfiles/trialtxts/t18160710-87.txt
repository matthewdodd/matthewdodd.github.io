JOHN SHERMAN. On the 13th of June last, I was opening my parlour door, and saw a man issuing from the area; he held his head down low as if to escape observation from the windows. I called the servants at the top of the stairs, but none of them answered. I then went to follow the person, and the prisoner walking very rapidly, with something bulky under his coat; I pursued him without my hat, not at all knowing what he had got. He turned his head round, and seeing somebody following him without a hat, he set off running, as fast as ever he could run; I run after him, but finding I could not gain upon him, I called out stop thief. Just as he turned the corner of Duke-street, that goes into Castle-street, he dropped something from him, which I discovered to be a leg of mutton. The prisoner was stopped. and brought back, pale, and breathless; I gave him in charge to an officer. This leg of mutton had been hanging in the area.

HANNAH ROBERTS
. I am the wife of William Roberts, and live at No. 4, Brunswick-street, Crown-street On the 2nd of April I went to purchase some things in a shop—I took out my purse, in which I had one sovereign, one half—sovereign, one half-crown, and one shilling; after paying for the articles I put the purse into my pocket—I pulled my hand out, and the prisoner put his hand in—I felt his hand in my pocket, I turned round, caught him by the arm, and never loosed him till I gave him in charge of the policeman—I saw my purse in his hand—he dragged me out of the shop, and pulled me up to a boy—whether he gave him the purse I cannot tell, but I saw it in his hand, and he had not got it when I gave him in charge.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was nobody in the shop besides you and the prisoner? A. My sister and another female—the butcher was there—it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night—the shop was very light—it is in West-street, Somers' Town—there were persons in the street—I am quite sure I saw the purse in the prisoner's hand.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

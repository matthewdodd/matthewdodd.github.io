MARK DYER MORGAN. I am a Henley carrier
. On Tuesday last I was in Newgate-street


, and had a bundle, containing the articles stated in the indictment, on the tail of my waggon - I saw the prisoner running on the pavement with it; I followed him, and he dropped it in Warwick-lane; I picked it up, and never lost sight of him till he was taken.

            . I am a native of Wallingford. I saw Morgan's waggon in Newgate-street that evening - I saw the prisoner jump from the tail, with a bundle under his arm; I told the waggoner of it: I followed him, calling Stop thief! he dropped the bundle in Warwick-lane, and I took him at the entrance of Warwick-square - he was running; I am positive he is the man.

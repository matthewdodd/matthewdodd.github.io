            , who are corn-chandlers

, and live at Enfield


. The prisoner, Tyler, worked in the barn
, and lived within half a mile of our granary; the prisoner Nicholls lived within three door of him, and worked at the farm. On the 9th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found the barn broken open - the lock had been forced off; I had locked it the night before, and left thirteen sacks of wheat in the chaff there, and a quantity loose about the floor. I missed four sacks of wheat in the chaff, which would produce ten bushels of wheat; there were foot marks of above two persons in the granary - I traced them into Nicholls's yard, which leads to both houses - I traced them to both houses; the shoes of one man had iron tips on them, but one was only half-tipt, as if it had been broken - they appeared to be the mark of one man; the other man had no particular marks. I have since seen a pair of shoes in possession of Mead; they corresponded exactly with the marks of the tips; I tried them with several, and have no doubt but they were the shoes that made them. I went with the constable to search Tyler's house between twelve and one o'clock that day, and found a sack there with loose chaff in it, also some chaff, and kernels of wheat on the floor. I then went to Nicholls, forced open the door, but found nobody there; I found about two sacks of loose chaff on the floor, in the sleeping-room; it appeared to have been lately separated from thewheat - it was scattered as if it had been sifted. The four sacks of wheat would produce two sacks of chaff; we found no sacks there.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Can you say whether the marks were made at night or in the evening when they left work - A. The marks appeared fresh - there were marks where they appeared to have rested.
Q. Might they not have gleaned it - A. If wheat is gleaned, it is generally taken to the mill immediately, and not kept until December.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had Nicholls any business in the granary - A. No, it is in the orchard close to the house - they came to work at six o'clock the next morning; I found four sieves and a pan, at Nicholls's.

            . I went with Godfrey, and found a sack on the bed, at Tyler's, and a little loose corn about, but not more than might have fell from his shoes. I then went to Nicholls's, and found the loose chaff in the house. I afterwards apprehended both the prisoners; Nicholls said if Godfrey did not mind what he was about, he would do for him. I afterwards found two sacks concealed in a wood, between the granary and the prisoners' houses.

            . I am servant to Messrs. Nutman. I left the sack found at Tyler's in the barn where he was threshing; I left it there on the Thursday before the robbery. The sacks are taken out of the barn and put in the granary, every night - it was empty then. It has the cornfactor's name on it.
Cross-examined. There were thirteen other sacks in the barn.

             re-examined. I produce the shoes which I took off Nicholls's feet. I did not compare them with the mark.

            . I compared them with the footmarks, and they fitted exactly. There were no empty sacks in the granary.
Cross-examined. I did not put the shoes on the impression - I judge from my sight.

            . I am a miller, and live at Waltham Abbey. On the 8th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, Nicholls came to me with eight bushels of wheat to be ground. Poor people generally bring gleaned wheat about a month after the harvest, but some keep it later.
Cross-examined. I have some gleaned wheat in the mill now.
GEORGE NUTMAN. I can swear to the sack found at Tyler's. The day after Nicholls was committed, he said Godfrey had sworn false against him, and he would do for him if he got free.
TYLER'S Defence. I borrowed the sack of my next door neighbour.

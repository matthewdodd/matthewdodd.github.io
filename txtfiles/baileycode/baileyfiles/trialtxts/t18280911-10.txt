On the 25th of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at shoe ribbons; I missed a handkerchief which he had been close by, I went round the counter, took his hat off, and found it in it - there was nobody else in the shop; I asked what business he had with it; he muttered something, and walked to the door, but I detained him, and gave him in charge.

1621. 




EDWARD ATKINSON
 was indicted

 for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling house of 



Thomas Stroud, at 
St. Peter upon Cornhill, about three o'clock in the night of the 
16th of May, with intent to steal.






THOMAS STROUD
. I keep the Spread Eagle tap in Gracechurch-street, and rent the house. On Saturday morning I was awoke at half-past three o'clock by my porter—I got up, and went down stairs to the bar-door, and saw the prisoner getting in at the bar-window from the coach-yard—he pulled down the upper sash, and got over the window—the sash was not fastened, but merely kept up by its own weight—he got over that into the bar—I had left my porter to watch—my till was in the bar—I sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody.





WILLIAM AYLING
. I am a porter. I sat up in the bar to keep watch—I heard the bar-window pulled down and some dogs bark—nobody came in then—I went and called my master, went down again to the bar, and placed myself where I was before—my master came down, and stood in the passage outside—I saw the prisoner come and poll the top sash down, get over the window, and come in a direction towards me—he had passed the till, and was looking round the place—I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him his business—he said he was very hungry, and wanted to get something to eat.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

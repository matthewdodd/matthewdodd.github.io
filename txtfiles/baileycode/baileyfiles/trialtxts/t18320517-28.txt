ROBERT BRADFORD. I am a surgeon
, and live in Fleet-street. On the 30th of April, about one o'clock in the day, I was in Cheapside


, a few doors from Queen-street - I felt something at my pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner putting something into his breast - he appeared to have a companion with him; I seized him directly - his companion followed him to Guildhall, but I have not seen him since; on my collaring the prisoner, and charging him with it, he took the handkerchief from his breast, and gave it to me - he struggled very hard to get away, and dragged me some way down Queen-street - at last some gentleman came to my assistance and secured him.

            . I was on duty in Cheapside; I received some information, and found the prisoner in custody in Queen-street with the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Cheapside; the handkerchief fell at my feet - I picked it up, and put it into my breast; I gave it to the gentleman directly he asked for it - I had been only ten days in London, and had nobody with me.

CHARLES HITCHINGS
. I am a cab-driver, and live in Watney-street, Commercial-road—at Half-past eight o'clock on Saturday evening, the 27th of August, I was in the Poultry—I saw the prisoner following the prosecutrix moving up her dress with his left hand, and his right band in her pocket—I stopped my horse and went over the way, I tapped the lady on her shoulder, and told her she was robbed—the prisoner had then hardly taken his hand out of her pocket, and in taking it out he took out a small portion of the handkerchief out in his hand—there was one or two others with him—I turned immediately and took him by the breast—I said, "That was the man"—he made a violent blow at me—I happened to stoop down a little, and he sent my hat half way across the road—I warned him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. At what rate were you driving? A. Not very fast—I was in the Police for five years—I resigned—there were a good many persons about—nothing was passing between me and the prosecutrix.





ELIZA FORD
. I am the wife of Charles Ford, we live in Edward-place, Aldersgate-street. About half-past eight o'clock on this evening I was in the

Poultry, carrying a small parcel—a person brushed twice against me, and the last time somebody said, "All right"—Hitchings touched me on the shoulder and told me I had been robbed—I turned, my handkerchief was half way out of my pocket, and my purse was gone—the prisoner was close behind me—no one was between me and him that I am aware of.

Cross-examined. Q. There were a good many persons round? A. Yes—when I saw the prisoner Hitchings had got hold of him by the breast. (Thomas Powell, carpenter, Edward-street, Hoxton Old Town, gave the prisoner a good character.)

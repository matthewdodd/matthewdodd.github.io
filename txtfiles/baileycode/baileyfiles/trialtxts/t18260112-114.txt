            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw the prisoner with a box, at the corner of Wentworth-street, on the 21st of December - I asked him what it was - he said"Things;" I said, "What!" he said he did not know - but he had brought it from some place in Cheapside, and was going to his mother's. I left him in charge of my brother officer and went to his mother, who was not at home. I then went back and broke the box open. I found a letter in it which led me to the prosecutor's.

            . I am a carrier to Hackney, Homerton, and Clapton. I took this box up in King-street, Cheapside, to deliver at Mr. Clarke's, No. 4, London-terrace, Hackney-road - it was tied behind my cart with a thick cord; I saw it safe at Aldgate Church


, and missed it in Houndsditch


 - the knot was untied and the box was gone.

            . I am a warehouseman. I know this box to be my property - this instrument case and these books are mine - I had left it in the city to be sent to my mother's house in Hackney Road.
Prisoner's Defence. Two young men asked me to carry this box - I took it down Wentworth-street, and the officer stopped me.

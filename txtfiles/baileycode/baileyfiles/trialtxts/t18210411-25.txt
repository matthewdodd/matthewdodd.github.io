            . I live in Cornhill, in the parish of St. Michael



, and rent the house; the prisoner was in my employ, as porter
; he came in April, 1819, and left a short time, being ill, returned about the 6th of September, and remained in my service till he was apprehended. He had the care of the shop, while the shopmen were at dinner. I took stock at Christmas, missed a variety of articles, and caused enquiry to be made at at different pawnbrokers, in consequence of which I had him apprehended on the 28th of March.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Baldwin's-gardens. I produce two gold seals and a gold key, which I took in pawn of the prisoner on the 26th of March, for 1 l. 14 s. I am sure it was the prisoner.
Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You do business with a variety of people. - A. Yes, he was five or ten minutes with me, and pawned them all at one time.

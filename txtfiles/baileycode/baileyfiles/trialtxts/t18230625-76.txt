 - the prisoner was in my service for about a fortnight, and entrusted to receive money on my account. Monk and Owen were customers of mine. On the 26th of May
 I desired the prisoner to collect from them; he went out, and never returned; but was apprehended in about a fortnight. He never paid me this money.

            . I live in Little Denmark-street, and owed Mr. Thompson 1 l. 6 s. 9 d. I paid the prisoner a sovereign of it on the 26th of May - he wrote it off the bill, which I have lost. I paid the rest on the 28th, and told 
               Thompson
             I had paid it.

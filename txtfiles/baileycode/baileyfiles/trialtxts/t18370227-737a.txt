SARAH MARIA PROGER
. I am a widow, and live in Denmark-street, St.

Giles'. In the latter end of October the prisoners came and took my first floor front room, furnished—they paid a week's rent—they staid a fort night, and both left between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—they did not pay the rent—the door was left locked, and the key taken away—I sent for a man to force it open, and the property stated was gone—I have never seen it since.





EDWARD CRANE
. I live in Crown-street, So ho, with my mother. On the morning of the 9th of November I was at my mother's shop-door, and saw the prisoner Newman come out of the prosecutrix's house between eight and nine o'clock, with a large bundle, and pass down Crown-street; Taylor came out shortly, and after went down Denmark-street, towards St. Giles's Church—I did not notice whether she had any thing.

Taylor. I left the house at half-past seven o'clock, and then every thing was safe. Witness. I saw her come out between eight and nine o'clock.

Newman's Defence. I left the room that morning, and every thing was quite safe; the door locked, and the key put under the mat—the bundle I had in my hand was a carpet bag, and a few things I wanted for myself—I went to Hammersmith by the coach.





JOHN FOLLETT
 (police-constable D 125.) I got this certificate of the prisoner Taylor's former conviction of felony from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

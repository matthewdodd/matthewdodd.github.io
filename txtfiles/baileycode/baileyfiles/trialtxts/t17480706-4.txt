            . On the twenty-fifth of June, as I was going thro' Swithin's-Alley


, about four o' clock in the afternoon, I was alarm'd by Mr. Moxum, that my pocket was picked; I turned about immediately, and seized the boy
, and missed my handkerchief.
Q. Did you find any thing upon the Prisoner?
Slade. I did not find any thing upon him; it appeared, that he delivered it to another accomplice.
Q. How did it appear? did it appear to you?
Slade. I did not see him.
Q. You are to tell me what you know of your own knowledge, not what you have from other people.
Slade. I know nothing of his taking it, but what I had from Mr. Moxum.


                  John 
                  Moxum 
               



            . I live at Hamlin's Coffee-house, in Swithin-Alley; and as I sat in the house, I saw the Prisoner take this gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket, and it was conveyed down into a cellar, and was brought up the next morning, and the gentleman came and owned it.
Q. Was there any body else with the Prisoner then?
Moxum. There was another boy close by him.
Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner before?
Moxum. No, never, before that day.




               Guilty, 10 d.

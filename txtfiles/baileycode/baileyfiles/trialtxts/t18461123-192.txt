JOHN BEAMISH
. I live in White-street, Southwark, and am a skinner and furrier. Hill was in my employ, and Watkins has been with me—I lost a quantity of rags lately; in consequence of which, I spoke to the constable to watch the prisoners—he showed me a quantity of rags—I believe them to be mine—I have rags which I bought corresponding with them in every respect. Watkins. Q. What can you swear to the property by? A. I do not swear to it—it exactly corresponds with mine—I bought it from a man out of the country—the bag was a bacon-wrapper, and it contained a coat and a pair of plaid trowsers—the bag corresponds exactly with what I had.

Walkings Defence. I bought it of a man who brought them there for sale.

. On the 13th of August the prisoner came into the public-house in the evening; I saw him take a coat off the nail, by the fire-place, in the tap-room - he went out of the yard; I followed him, and said."That don't belong to you;" he said it did; I went into the room - they said it was not his; I and a man went in pursuit, and took him on Holborn-hill, in a wine-vaults, with it.

WILLIAM ROCK. I am tap-boy
 at the Saracen's Head. This coat was given to me by Martin, a coachman - it belonged to a passenger of his coach; master was to take care of it - I was answerable for it; I know nothing of the prisoner; James Crow keeps the house.(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I had come from Hertford the day previous; I went into the Saracen's Head - I have a coat nearly resembling that, and took this by mistake; as well as I can recollect I had drunk rather too much.

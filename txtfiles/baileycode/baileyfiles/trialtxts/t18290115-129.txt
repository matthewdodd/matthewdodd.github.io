            . I am brother of James Reading - he keeps a grocer's shop
. On the evening of the 16th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was having my supper, and was informed some boys were at the door; I ran out, and saw the prisoner with this drum of figs in his hand; he dropped it at the step of the door, and ran away - I pursued, and he was taken at the top of the street; it my brother's property.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw some persons run - I ran, and a gentleman stopped me, and said I had stolen a box of figs; the officer told the witness he must swear that he saw me drop them, or else they could not hurt me.

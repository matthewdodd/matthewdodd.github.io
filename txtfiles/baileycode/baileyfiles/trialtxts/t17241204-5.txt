             deposed, that being a Nurse at Mr. Walter's, a Druggist
, in Cheapside


, where the Prisoner was a Servant
, she often missed some of the Child's Clouts in washing, but could never think what became of them, till one day she happened to find the Maid's Petticoat, which was made of the same Clouts that before had been missing. And upon further Search, found a Gown of her's that was lined with part of the Prosecutor's Sheet. The Prisoner confessed the Fact before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fryer 
               



            , and said that she threw the remaining part of the Sheet down the Vault, to prevent a Discovery, having dream'd that her Mistress had found out what she had done. But this she deny'd at the Bar, and said that that Gown was lined with two of her own Aprons, and that she had the Petticoat before she came to the Prosecutor's Service. Her Confession was read in Court, and the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

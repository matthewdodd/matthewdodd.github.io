HENRIETTA BRUCK
. I am the wife of Louis Henry Bruck. On 25th Nov. I was in Bishopsgate-street, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I had a purse in my pocket, containing 1l. 8s. 4d.—there was a sovereign, and half a crown, and a shilling, and two small keys, and two little memorandums—I know my purse was safe five minutes before—I saw the prisoner M'Carthy take my purse—I saw it go out of my pocket, and he put it into his pocket—he was next to me, and Hawkins was behind him—M'Carthy went and spoke to Hawkins, and he handed him something, and then Hawkins walked off—the policeman came, and said, "What is the

matter?"—I said M'Carthy had taken my purse—he said, "You keep him," and he ran after Hawkins, and took him, and brought him back—he then took M'Carthy.

M'Carthy. Q. Did you not put your hand into my pocket, and then say you was very sorry you accused me? A. I said I was very sorry to have to accuse you of it.





HENRY FERRETT
 (City-police, constable, 624). I came up to this lady, and she said she was robbed—she pointed to M'Carthy as one, and said the other was gone that way—I went after Hawkins, and took him—I found this purse in his pocket.

MRS. BRUCK
re-examined. This is my purse.

M'Carthy's Defence. She said, "You have got my purse;" I said, "No;" she put her hand into my pocket, and said she was very sorry she had accused me; the policeman came up, and said, "What is the matter?" she pointed the other prisoner out, and the policeman said to a gentleman, "Hold this one?" and he went and took the other prisoner and brought him back, and then he took me.

            . I am a gardener
, I employed the prisoner to work for me about three months; having occasion to remove he assisted me; I missed my watch which hung at the head of my bed. When the prisoner was taken up, he confessed he had stole it, and directed us to Mr. Benson with whom he had left it.

            . I am a watchmaker: the prisoner brought this watch to me (producing it) about the 14th of December, to repair; the dial plate was broke. On the 20th the prosecutor and the constable came to my house for the watch.

I found it in the room amongst some dirt; I intended to have got it mended, and then to have returned it to the owner.

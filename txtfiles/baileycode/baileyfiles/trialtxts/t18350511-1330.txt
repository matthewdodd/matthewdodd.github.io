1330. 




WILLIAM DIXON
 and 




THOMAS BRAGG
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



John Rouse, from his person.







JOHN ROUSE
. I was in the service of Mr. Spottiswoode. I went to Greenwich fair on the 20th of April—I had a pocket handkerchief in my pocket—I did not miss it till the officer tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I had lost any thing—this is my handkerchief, it has my mark on it.





JOHN HOBBS
 (police-constable C 85.) I was on duty in Greenwich fair, on the 20th of April—I saw the two prisoners standing close against the prosecutor, and by seeing their elbows move, I suspected they had drawn a handkerchief—I took them into custody, and saw Dixon throw this handkerchief on the ground; my brother-officer was close by, and I believe he saw the handkerchief drawn—I had watched them for seven or eight minutes.

Dixon. Q. If you saw me draw the handkerchief, why did not you take me? A. I took you directly I saw your elbows move.





JOHN JONES
 (police-constable S 77.) I saw the two prisoners behind Mr. Rouse—we had watched them before, feeling pockets, and when they went behind Mr. Rouse, Bragg drew this handkerchief, and passed it to Dixon—I seized Bragg, and Hobbs seized Dixon, and that moment the handkerchief fell on the ground.

Dixon's Defence. We were looking at one of the shows—the officer came and charged us with stealing the handkerchief, which I did not see till it was at the station-house.
(Robert Evans, of Slater-street; Thomas Collins, of St. John-street; and Ellen Davis, of Market-street, Finsbury-square; gave Bragg a good character, the latter of whom promised to employ him: and Samuel Desert, of No. 4, Nicholl's-row, gave Dixon a good character.)

DIXON—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

BRAGG—


GUILTY
. Aged 14.—



Confined Three Months.

Sixth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

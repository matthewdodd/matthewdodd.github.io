             sworn.
I live in Prince's-street, Soho


. A little before ten in the evening, on the 17th of April, a piece of glass was cut out of my shop window, large enough to admit a hand: I am a perfumer: there was a tray full of tooth pick cases; I lost them out of the window; there were four or five.
What was the amount? - I cannot say; the prisoners were detected in the fact.

             sworn.
I know the prisoners. I was going up Prince's-street about ten on Saturday evening: I saw the prisoners at Mrs. Dowling's window; they stood close together; when they saw me, one of them turned his head about; I stopped for about ten minutes, to take notice of them; they went gently away about four or five yards, and then ran away: I went and put my hand to the glass, and found one of the panes was cut; they went about ten yards; there I took one of them directly: these tooth pick cases were found on them; and this he threw down an area.
(Deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
Court. What is the value of these things? - I will value them at half a crown.

            . I am footman to Mr. Isaac Hensley - he lives at Hackney



 - I missed this glass muffineer and a pair of sugar-tongs on the 4th of January - this is the muffineer - I know it is my master's - the sugar-tongs have not been found - I missed them about half-past nine o'clock.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This top is not silver? - A. Yes, it is - here are two or three private marks on it, and a lion - I may have seen marks on plated articles - I cannot swear to the glass, but I can to the lid - I broke a glass about three years ago, and had a new one made to the lid; and I had this new rim made to the lid.
COURT. Q. Have you been in the habit of cleaning it? - A. Yes, for thirteen years - I have no doubt it is my master's.

            . I live at Hackney - I was going to the prosecutor's with milk on the 4th of January, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw Aland come out of the kitchen-door - I did not see that he had anything with him.


                  HENRY 
                  OLDFIELD
               



            . I live at Hackney - on the 4th of January, I saw Aland and another boy
; they went and called a third boy out; and I saw Aland show this muffineer, which he said he was going to fence - I did not know what it meant till afterwards - we then went to Alderson's house, in Cooper's-gardens, Hackney-road



 - Aland went in, and sold the articles; I stayed at the door - he came out in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he then showed me six shillings and a handkerchief - James Alderson ran out after us, and told us to be sure not to tell that he had sold the things there - we then went to Clerkenwell, and Aland got a loaf and some butter to take to a boy in Clerkenwell prison.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him what he meant by fence? A. No; I often used to go with him, and play with him; I afterwards heard the word fence meant to sell things, from some boys, one of them named Woodcock; but I do not know that he said the word - I have been in the custody of an officer once, that is about a year ago, it was for beating a boy - I have not been taken up since, that I recollect - I never was taken up for thieving - I shall be seventeen years old in November.
Q. Do you remember a tortoise-shell snuff-box? A. Yes, Sir, I stole that and sold it, but it was my aunt's; I never was accused of stealing anything else - I know Mr. Harrison, a pawn-broker - I have been there for my aunt.
Q. Were you ever accused of stealing a silk handkerchief? A. Yes, Sir, but not there; I was accused of stealing one - I was accused of stealing a waistcoat, but Mr. Steventon gave it me to take to a woman, and these boys coaxed me away to take and sell it, and we shared the money in drink - I work for my living - I go with a man who sells coke and greens.
COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that 
               
                  James 
                  Alderson
               



             said that you were not to tell that you sold the things there? A. Yes; I have had no quarrel with Aldersons - they never charged me with anything.

             (police-constable, N 236). I took Aland in Well-street, Hackney - the inspector asked him if he knew Mr. Hensley's; he said yes, but he had not been nearer to it than Clapton-alley, which is three or four hundred yards from it - I went the next morning to Alderson's house - the sergeant was with me; he went to the sideboard, and when he drew his hand back I saw this muffineer in his hand - Aldersons said they did not know it was in the house.
Cross-examined. Q. Was Mrs. Alderson there? A. Yes; she said, at first, she had no knowledge of it, but afterwards said it was brought by a young man who asked her to let him leave it till Sunday morning.

             (police-constable, S 19). I went to Aldersons' - I saw them and another person in the room - I said I had come for some things they had purchased of a boy the day before - they denied having purchased anything - I found this muffineer among some glasses on the top of a cupboard - I held it up, and asked Cornelius Alderson if he could account for its being there - he said he knew nothing of it - I then asked James Alderson, and he denied knowing any thing of it - I then asked Mrs. Alderson; she at first denied it, but afterwards said a man brought it in the day before, and asked her to purchase it, but she would not, and he left it on the table - I said I wanted some other things, and if she would tell me where they were, she would save me a great deal of trouble - she said if I would not let the thing go any further, she would see what she could find - I took her and the two Aldersons - I could find nothing else.
Cross-examined. Q. Was not the other officer there? A. Yes; he came in just as I asked her about purchasing the things - he was in the room when Mrs. Alderson desired me to let it go no further, but I do not know whether he heard it - he was not more than three yards from me.

            . Q. How came you to omit this statement? A. I cannot say that I heard it; my attention was on the door.
Cross-examined. Q. I thought you said, that you heard a question asked of Mrs. Alderson? A. Yes, and she gave an answer to it - 
               
                  Cornelius 
                  Alderson
               



             is a dog-fancier - he had a dog which he wanted to get away - he got outinto the yard with a dog - I put my leg out of the window, and called him back; I do not know that he meant to escape; he then sat down to sew some shoes.

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Wood-street, Tabernacle-square - I have one room; I have a wife; she lives with me - I taught

             my business, and I now give him work, which he does in my room - on Saturday, the 4th of January, the day before he was taken up, he came to me at daylight in the morning; he stayed till between twelve and one o'clock, when he went to dinner; he then came again, and worked till between four and five o'clock.

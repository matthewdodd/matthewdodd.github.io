The Prosecutor depos'd, That for some Time past, notwithstanding his utmost Diligence in business, and the considerable Returns of Money he made, he still found himself in a sinking Condition, and thinking it necessary to watch the Prisoner, who he had but too much Reason to suspect, he mark'd several Pieces of Money before a Neighbour, and leaving the Key of the Closet, in which the Money was put, in the Hands of the said Neighbour, he set his Servant to watch her in a Place adjoining to the Closet, who saw her open the Door with a Key she had provided for that Purpose, and took something out; and upon his detecting her the mark'd Money was found upon her: The Circumstances being confirm'd by several Witnesses, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

                  SUTER
               



            . I am a wholesale rope and rag-merchant
, and live in Rose-lane, Limehouse. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, between half-past eight and a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I lost a pocket-book, containing the property stated in the indictment; I was within fifty or a hundred yards of Tower-hill, and perfectly sober at the time - I had been doing business from dinner time till the evening, and not being home in time for tea I went with a Mr. Williams to the Bear and Wheatsheaf, Lower Thames-street




; we stopped outside the house for about a minute, and the two female prisoners crossed the street to us; I said to my friend, "I will go and take a glass of gin and water;" he went in with me - we had occasion to stop for a certain purpose before we went in, and the prisoners went into the house first; we found them there - I did not at all join their company; we sat a quarter of an hour together, and then O'Brien asked my friend if she might take the liberty of taking a little gin and water with him - he said she might; Burke said, "I suppose I may take the same liberty." and I passed it to her; we were in the parlour - I did not feel disposed to drink after them, and called for another glass for myself; we sat a considerable time - I then said to Williams, "We will settle our money matters;" he said we had better let it be till another time, and not settle there; I however looked at my pocket-book, and my notes were then safe: a man sat at the further end of the table, about three yards from us, very drunk; nobody was near us but the women - Burke sat on my left side, and saw me count the notes: I returned the pocket-book to my left-hand coat pocket, with the notes in it, and to be satisfied that it was safe, felt it a few minutes afterwards; after that I spoke to Williams, and leaned my head on my hand, which completely exposed my pocket - we sat twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour after that: I then said I should go, as it had done raining - the two women then went out; Burke first, and the other a minute after: I and Williams left together in about five minutes - neither of the male prisoners were in the room. After I had gone about one hundred yards towards Tower-hill I missed my pocket-book - there were about six persons assembled near the pavement as I came out of the public-house, but I did not go near enough for them to be able to touch my person; nobody had been near enough to touch me but the two women - we returned to the house, and mentioned my loss to the landlord - (I saw the women at Town-hall, Borough, on the following Tuesday, and was certain of them;) after mentioning my loss to the landlord, we went to Bull's Head-court, Borough. On Monday morning I went to Smith, Payne, and Co.'s, banking-house, for the numbers of my notes; I had received them for a cheque drawn by 
               
                  John 
                  Jones
               



            : I saw one of the 5l. notes at the Bank on Monday morning, having stopped payment of it, and a 10l. note at Town-hall, in the watch-house-keeper's hands - Mahoney was in custody- the other was taken on Monday morning.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure that is all you can tell us? A. It is; the landlord's name is Coleman - I do not know his wife; I saw a female in the bar: I did not go to the house with the women - they were there about a minute before me; nor did I leave the house with them. I am married; neither I nor Williams applied for beds at Coleman's house, nor were we informed that the rooms were double bedded; I did not say a double bedded room would be better, as I would have more fun. I did not say to Coleman or his wife when I returned, that the two women were not the women who took the property; that is as true as all I have said - I went there to have a glass of gin and water, not having taken any thing since dinner; I had been to Mr. Van's, in the Borough, on business - Coleman's house is nearly opposite the Custom-house; it was in my road home, and perhaps my nearest way - we had two glasses of gin and water each; the women came up as we stopped at the bottom of an alley, by the public-house; nothing passed at the public-house about beds: neither of the women charged me with taking indecent liberties with them, nor did I - I heard one call the other Mrs. Burke.
Q. How came you to find your way to Bull's Head-court? A. In consequence of one of the women saying tothe other, "I must go;" the other said, "Oh, it is not so far; Bull's Head-court is not so far," and Williams said he heard one of them say they lived there; I did not hear it myself - I am rather deaf: I suppose my pocket must have been exposed when I leant my head on my elbow - my pocket-book could be taken without my knowing it; I lost it between half-past seven and a quarter to nine o'clock - I was perfectly sober; the women were not in our company: there was an old man in the room - he went away; there was another man there, and these women - that was all besides us; Williams went out for a minute while I was in the house, not more: I swear neither of the women went with him - I had no intention of any familiarity with them; I gave neither of them any money.


                  EDWARD 
                  WILLIAMS
               



            . I am a ship-chandler, and live in Wapping Dock-street. On the 22nd of August I was with Suter; we went into the Bear and Wheatsheaf, as near as I can guess, from seven to half-past, by ourselves; before we went in I observed the prisoners at the corner of the alley - I saw the same two in the house when we went in; I had no conversation with them before we went in: we sat in the parlour, and they were there - one was sitting at the same table as us, and the other standing up; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes they asked to drink with us - we had no conversation with them before that; they had no liquor that I saw - I sat on the opposite side of the table to Suter: on their asking to drink with us I said she might - I think it was O'Brien; she was sitting near to me, but not particularly close - she was standing up at first; the other was sitting on the left of Suter: she also asked to drink, and he allowed her - she was near enough to him to touch him, I think; he pulled his pocket-book out while Burke was sitting by him, and said loud enough for them to hear, that he had a 20l., a 10l., and two 5l. notes; the women were sitting with us for an hour or an hour and a quarter - I observed Suter put his pocket-book into his pocket, after counting his notes; nobody was near enough to him to take it but Burke; one of us said, "Let us go," and then the women went out - we each had two glasses of gin and water; we had drank nothing, and were both perfectly sober; we left four or five minutes after them, and went down Thames-street, towards Tower-hill, which is the direct road to Limehouse; we got about one hundred yards from the house when Suter complained of his pocket-book being gone. In the course of conversation I heard one of them, (I think O'Brien,) say she lived in Bull's Head-court; we returned to the public-house, but I did not see them till at Guildhall, on the Friday following; a 5l. and a 10l. note were produced - I was not at Union-hall; there was no familiarity whatever between either of us and the women, nor any conversation that could lead to such a course.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; I saw the women first in Thames-street, but had no conversation with them - they did not cross to talk to us, to the best of my knowledge; several people crossed the street - I did not see them crossing; I saw them standing - I had no conversation with them in Thames-street, nor had my friend, to my knowledge; I believe I was out of his sight, about twelve yards, for a certain purpose; I did not see him talking to them - I dined at home that day: Suter came to my house - he did not dine with me; we had three or four places to go to on business, but went to no other public-house; I had no money but silver - I missed none; the women did not go into the public-house with us - I wanted none of their company; there was only one table in the room; we went into the parlour, it being the most respectable; nothing passed between us and them for a quarter of an hour - Suter and I were talking on business; I had not the slightest reason to believe them women of the town; I believe one of them mentioned her husband.
Q. Did not she threaten to tell her husband of Mr. Suter's conduct? A. She did not say any thing of the kind; I went out of the room for about a minute and a half, for a necessary purpose, but not with O'Brien; Burke was on Suter's left side - they might very likely touch each other; she sat close to him - I consider she was sitting near enough to touch him - he was in conversation with me- he was not directing his conversation particularly to her- the landlord came in three or four times; nobody asked for a bed in my hearing, nor was any thing said about a double bedded room; we were both perfectly sober - he pulled his pocket-book out because he said the corner of it was torn; he found his money safe: there was one person in the parlour: I heard Coleman say his wife was not at home - I think he said so to the person at the bottom of the table; they appeared intimate - I did not ask for a bed - all the conversation I had with him was about the reckoning; Suter did not say he was sure the women had not taken the pocket-book; he suspected they had took it, and I believe said so.

                  TURNER
               



            . I live with Mr. Winstanley, a haberdasher. On Saturday, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the two female prisoners came to the shop; I recollect their persons perfectly well; O'Brien tendered me a 5l. note for goods - I declined giving change for it, and handed it over to Mr. Winstanley; he said he had no change; I asked if they had 6s. 9d. to pay for the goods: they said they had not, and went out, taking the note and leaving the goods; Mr. Winstanley sent a young man after them, to say be could give change, and they came back- Mr. Winstanley took the note into his room to look at it; he came out, and said he doubted its being good, but if they would leave it till Monday morning he would ascertain if it was good, and they should have the change, which they agreed to, and went away; on Monday morning O'Brien came with the prisoner Hackett - Mr. Winstanley was out; I said if they would call again they should have the money if the note was good; Hackett said it was a hard thing the woman should be detained, as she wanted to go in the country - they left; Hackett called again, alone: master told him he could not pay the money without the woman being present; he went to fetch her - Mr. Winstanley sent a young man to watch where he went to, and he was detained; the woman never came - Hackett was brought to our shop and taken in charge; I saw O'Brien at Guildhall on Friday, and was perfectly certain of her being the person; I put my initials on the 5l. note.
Cross-examined. Q. When? A. Previous to its being given up to them on the Saturday night.


                  JOHN 
                  KINSEY
               



            . I am an officer of Town-hall. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, about ten o'clock at night, Mr. Williams and another gentleman came to me - I went toMcCarthy's house, but found nobody then; on Monday the 24th, about nine at night, I found O'Brien at the Bull, Bull-court, Tooley-street; I knew her before - I told her she was charged with robbing a gentleman, but she was half drunk; I took her into the kitchen of the publichouse - she had a large bundle; I took 19s. 7d. from her; she had changed a sovereign for a pot of beer in my presence; I went to McCarthy's, and found Burke partly concealed in a coal-hole; I took her out of the house - she had in her left hand a small basket with 11s. in it, and in her right hand a small paper rolled up; I endeavoured to secure that, but she snatched at it and fore it - I have the pieces here; it is a receipt for a 10l. note, No.3807, deposited with Basset, a watch-house-keeper, at Bermondsey, that evening; O'Brien said, in her presence, "That is the woman that robbed the gentleman;" Burke made no answer; at six o'clock on Tuesday morning, I went with Basset to Dockhead, and apprehended Mahoney, and a woman named McCray; I told Mahoney he was charged with claiming a 10l. note on Friday evening at the watch-house; he said he was drunk at the time or he should not have done it - (receipt read).
Cross-examined. Q. O'Brien said Burke had robbed the gentleman; did you not say she was very drunk? A. O'Brien was half drunk.


                  JOSHUA 
                  FREEMAN
               



            . I am a clerk in the Bank - I have a 5l. note, No.25,368, dated 7th July, 1829, which was stopped at the Bank on the 24th of August - it was claimed by Suter.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive it yourself? A. I got it from the Secretary's-office, from Mr. Stewart, who is not here - I only know it was stopped by a memorandum on it in Stewart's writing - who brought it to the Bank I do not know.
COURT. Q. Has it been paid by the Bank? A. It has not - if it had it would have been cancelled; if it had not been stopped it would have been paid - it is a genuine note.


                  JOHN 
                  BASSET
               



            . On Monday, the 24th of August, I was on duty for a patrol of Bermondsey - Burke and Mahoney were brought in, charging each other with a felony; Burke gave her name as Hackett and said Mahoney had robbed her of a 10l. note, and he said she had robbed him of one; they were both intoxicated; the note was in the possession of Burke - I never saw it in Mahoney's possession; I detained it, and gave Burke a receipt for it; she said her husband was foreman at the London-docks, and had earned it; the receipt produced is my writing - it has been torn since; I have had the note in my possession ever since -Suter claimed it before the Magistrate.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did you see Mahoney at the watch-house? A. About five minutes to nine; I did not ask his address, for I knew him from his infancy, and knew his parents to be respectable; I apprehended him at his lodgings next morning - I believe he is married.


                  JOHN 
                  BRIANT PRIESTMAN
               



            . I am a clerk at Smith, Payne, and Co.'s. On the 21st of August I paid Suter a 25l. cheque, drawn by John Jones - I gave him a 20l. note, No.19,232, dated 10th July, 1829, and a 5l. note, No.35,368. dated the 7th July; I saw the 5l. note at Guildhall, and am certain it is the same. Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the entry in your writing? A. Yes; I have seen Suter five or six times before, and am certain I paid it to him, for he applied to me very soon after for the numbers of the notes - I paid it about half-past three o'clock - the book the entry is in closes at four.


                  WILLIAM 
                  THOMAS
               



            . I am a clerk at Sir R.C. Glyn and Co.'s. I have an entry of the payment of a cheque of 28l. 14s. drawn by 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Van
               



            , on the 17th of August, for which I gave two 10l. notes, Nos.3,807 and 3,808, dated 21st July, a 5l. note, No. 129, and 3l. 14s. - the 10l. note produced is one of them; I was applied to for the numbers afterwards - I am not certain whether it was for a cheque or bill.


                  THOMAS 
                  SUTER
               



            . I received this 5l. note from Smith and Co.'s, in payment of a draft of 25l. - I applied at Glyn's on losing my money; I saw this 10l. note. No.3,807, before the Magistrate - I received it for a draft drawn by Thomas Van, for 28l. 14s. from Mr. Thomas.


                  JOHN 
                  HELLIER
               



            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Bermondsey-street. On the 22nd of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening the prisoner Mahoney came with two women - I recollect Burke as one of them, the other is not here - they appeared intoxicated and scarcely knew what they wanted; Mahoney told me to take down a shawl marked 7s., both the women spoke about it - another shawl was taken down, they bargained for both, and produced a 10l. Bank note - it came from Mahoney's hands; I did not give change for it - it was snatched out of my hand by Burke, and she put it into her bosom - they ran away - I did not follow them.


                  JOHN 
                  HOLLAND
               



            . I am street-keeper of Holborn. I saw Hackett in the custody of Mr. Winstanley.s man - he delivered him to me: I found two letters on him - I do not know the hand-writing - it is sealed up and signed O'Brien.
O'Brien's Defence. She gave me the 5l. note to change, to treat myself with a silk-handkerchief, a pair of stockings and gloves; Burke told me Suter had presented her with the note - I was turned out of the room; I did not know where she got the note - she told me to say my husband gave it to me; I took my husband to change it - she had been alone with Suter for a quarter of an hour; I did not know what note it was, as I cannot read or write.
Burke's Defence. O'Brien held me in the room by my clonk, and put a piece of paper into my hand - I did not know what it was till I looked at the note.


                  WILLIAM 
                  COLEMAN
               



            . I am landlord of the Bear and Wheatsheaf. Thames-Street. I saw Suter and another gentleman at my house on the 22nd of August; I went into the parlour, twice while they were there - I was taking in beer - there were two females there, they sat on the same seat; I have no recollection of the prisoners; I cannot say whether they drank together - Suter came and asked me something; I believe a bed was named - I told him it was engaged - he said could he have a bed - I said it was engaged - we are rather particular who we take in - and when gentlemen and ladies come they have bagage - I said, "I had no single bedded room: and for man and wife, I had none at all." He said nothing about a double bedded-room - I saw the women leave before them; I thought the prosecutor had come from Gravesend, as the boat comes in at that time; he did not ask for a bed for more than himself - he merely asked if I had a bed; Isaid, they were all engaged - I do not know why I said I had no single beds.
COURT. Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoners? A. I never saw them before - I think the women came up my yard before the men.
Prisoner O'Brien. Will you ask Mr. Williams if Suter did not give Burke the note.


                  EDWARD 
                  WILLIAMS
               



            . When I went out for about a minute, I believe, O'Brien was out for about half a minute; she came back and was in the house for full an hour after; they went away both together, after Suter expressed his intention of going.


                  THOMAS 
                  SUTER
               



            . I never used any familiarity with either of them, or made them a present of any thing; on my oath I did not ask for a bed at all.

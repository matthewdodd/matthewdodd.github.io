. The beginning of March I missed a great many things; I employed the prisoner and another woman; I went to the prisoner's lodgings on the 15th; I saw the napkins upon a table under a glass; she still persisted they were not my property, and she would punish me for claiming them: I had the fellows to them; I had particular marks that I am sure of them by.

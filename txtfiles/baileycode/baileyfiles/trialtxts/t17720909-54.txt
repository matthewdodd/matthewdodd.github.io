            . I am a porter to Mr. Bickerton, a charcoal-man
; on the 20th of last month, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and I were coming up Snow-hill


; I pulled my watch out to see what time of the day it was; he desired to look at it; I gave it into his hand; he immediately ran off with it; I cried stop thief! and Mr. Ashmore stopt him; he had got about 100 yards off. The watch was taken upon him.
Q. Were you acquainted?
Collinson. No; we had entered into conversation together.
- Ashmore deposed, that he took the prisoner, in the yard belonging to the Saracen's Head; that at first he denied having the watch, but the witness threatened to search him, and then he produced it; that the prosecutor came up and mentioned the maker's name, and the number of the watch.
The prisoner said in his defence, that he was drunk, and did not know what he was about.

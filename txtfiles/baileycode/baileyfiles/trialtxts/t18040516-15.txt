                  JOHN 
                  ALDER
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. What are you, Mr. Alder? - A. I live at Yarmouth; I am a goldsmith and cutler
.
Q. Did you pack up the property that is mentioned in the indictment at Waltham-cross? - A. Yes.
Q. What day was it? - A. On the 8th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the trunk was put on the back of the chaise - it was a one-horse chaise; the trunk was fastened with two broad straps, about three inches broad, and stuck on iron pins, about an inch in length, as I have travelled for twelve years before. At the end of Long-lane


, and twenty yards before I came to Long-lane, I observed the trunk was safe; I saw it safe after I was about twenty yards in Smithfield; I then whipped my horse, I was within forty yards of the King's Head inn, Smithfield


, where I meant to put up.
Q. What time of the day was it? - A. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening.
Q. Immediately when you got to the inn, you looked and you observed the trunk was gone? - A. Yes, I immediately left the horse and chaise in care at the inn.
Q. In point of fact, you never saw the trunk since? - A. No; in about two minutes Oliver came to the King's Head, and gave me some information, and another man of the name of Woodland, he gave me some information.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a goldsmith at Yarmouth? - A. Yes.
Q. Carrying on trade there? - A. Yes.
Q. You have a partner? - A. I have no partner.
Q. This happened momentarily - it happenedalmost instantaneously? - A. Yes, it was very quick done.
Q. You had no opportunity of observing any person in Smithfield in course, it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening? - A. There were very few people in Smithfield, it was in Long-lane I saw a number of people; I did not miss it till I got to the King's Head.
Q. Being in danger, whether any thing had struck your attention at Long-lane? - A. Nothing more than I was in Long-lane.
Court. Q. After you come into London at dusk, it strikes your attention, and makes you careful? - A. Yes.
Q. It was dusk? - A. It was; I saw it perfectly safe in Smithfield.

                  Withers
               



            .
Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.
Court. Q. Have you known them before? - A. I have known King for three years, and Mussard for two years.
Q. What time was this? - A. About a quarter before seven o'clock at night, I saw the gentleman's chaise coming along Long-lane.
Q. Did you see the same gentleman come along Smithfield? - A. Yes; he drove to the King's Head, and there he stopped; I saw King take a knife out of his pocket and cut the strap; I do not know whether it was a strap or a rope; then he took it up on his arms and put it on his left shoulder, and went towards the end of Long-lane.
Q. At that time, when you observed King cut the straps, whereabouts was the other prisoner? did you see the other prisoner there? - A. He was standing a few yards from where Ryland was standing.
Q. Were they standing in Smithfield; Ryland and Mussard? - A. Just against the cross-way; it may be about a dozen yards from the chaise; Ryland was not half a yard from me, Muslin was standing two yards from me, and close to King.
Mr. Gleed. Q. After King had taken away the box from the chaise, what did King do with the box? - A. He went towards Long-lane with the box on his shoulder; as soon as they left me, I went to the King's Head, and informed the gentleman of it.
Q. Did you see any thing pass after at the end of Long-lane? - A. I saw them all three together, they were one on each side, and King in the middle.
Court. Q. Who had the box? - A. King; King was in the middle, and Muslin and Ryland were on each side, that was all I saw then; I went to the King's Head, and informed the gentleman, he was gone to Mr. Scott's, the toy-shop; he came to me afterwards; I did not tell him then that I knew the prisoners, I described the men.
Q. Are you sure these are the two men? - A. I am sure these are the two men, and Ryland was the third; and the next day I saw Ryland in Smithfield, he offered me a one-pound note, and I would not take it; King offered me a one-pound note, he was in company with three men, one of the men was of the name of Higgins; King put his hand in his pocket, and clapped me on the shoulder, and said, here, take this.
Q. What did he offer it for? - A. He did not say.
Q. Did they see you were on the watch? - A. Yes, they saw me standing there.
Q. I am talking of the day before - did they see you the day before? - A. I do not know whether they saw me or no, I saw them.
Q. It was light enough for them to see you, if they had a mind to see you? - A. One of them stood close by me, about a yard off, and the other two yards off.
Q. At the place where they were standing, could they see the chaise? - A. Yes.
Mr. Gleed. Q. Did any other thing pass? - A. On the Monday following, as I was going to my brother's in Golden-lane, I saw Ryland and Muslin standing together at a public-house door.
Court. Q. What time of the day? - A. It was in the evening, about eight o'clock; he asked me where I was going.
Q. Who asked you? - A. Ryland; I said, to my brother's; he then said he wanted to speak to me.
Q. Did you stop? - A. I did; he asked me what I meant to do in this business, those are the words he said to me; I said, to do that which was right; he said, if you do nothing in it, I will give you a couple of guineas.
Q. Which of them was it that said that? - A. I do not know which.
Q. Could the other man hear, whoever it might have been that said that? - A. Yes.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. At the time that you saw King doing the act that you were talking of, Muslin and Ryland were as far off as you were? - A. I was within three yards.
Q. Muslin and Ryland were close to you? - A. Muslin was, and Ryland was about two yards off; I was standing at the cross way just where they cut the trunk from the back of the chaise.
Q. At the second time you met Ryland and Muslin, how far distant was Muslin from Ryland? - A. The second time we met was at a public-house door.
Q. Do you mean to swear, that, talking to one man, that another man must hear? - A. He might if he liked.

Q. Suppose he did not like, what then? - A. I think he must hear; I do not know which of them it was at the public-house door that said they would give me the two guineas.
Q. You knew both their persons? - A. Yes, they were both together; I do not know which was nearest.
Q. Nor you do not know who spoke to you? - A. No, they might both speak to me.
Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known King? - A. Near three or four years.
Q. When you went to Mr. Alder, you did not tell their names? - A. I was afraid to tell him who they were, least I should get ill used.
Q. So your courage enabled you to go and tell him that three men had been concerned in stealing his trunk, but your courage would not let you tell him who they were - did you tell him that you did not know who they were? - A. I do not know that I did, to my knowledge.
Q. That is an odd way of swearing - am I to understand you, that you did not tell Mr. Alder you did not know who they were? - A. Yes.
Q. What are you? - A. I am a carman, I work for 
               
                  Ann 
                  Withers

Q. What on and off? -
Q.(To Prosecutor.) Did he tell you that he did not know the persons who took the trunk? - A. He did not tell me nothing about it.
Court. Q. Did he say he knew the persons, or that he did not? - A. I do not think he did.
Mr. Gurney. Q. Why, Mr. Alder, was not he taken in custody, and taken before the Lord-Mayor, in giving the information? - A. No.
Q. Was not he taken by an officer before the Lord-Mayor to be examined - he came and told you, soon after you lost the trunk, that he saw it taken away, did he tell you that he knew the persons? - A. He told me he knew their persons.
Q. Did he say he knew their names? - A. No, he did not say he knew their names; I advertised it.
Q. With a large reward? - A. Yes, of two hundred guineas; at the time I published the handbills, I did not know the names, that was on the same night.
Q. How soon did he tell you he knew their names? - A. It might be a few days after that he told me their names; he gave me a reason why he did not, he was afraid of being murdered.
Mr. Gleed. Q. The reward was for the recovery of the property? - A. Yes.
Q. And that property was never recovered? - A. No.

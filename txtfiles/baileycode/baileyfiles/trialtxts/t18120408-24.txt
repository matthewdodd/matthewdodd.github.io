            . I saw the prisoner coming out of the public-house, the Three Butts at the corner of the Old Jewry with a pot under his coat; I followed him to Basinghall-street and stopped him; the constable coming by asked me if I was a constable: I said, no, he said he would take charge of him; he did. Afterwards we found this other pot in the bag.
Prosecutor. This is my pot. The prisoner has been in the habit of coming to the house for some time. When I saw him at the Compter I said to him, I am sorry to see you here; I thought he was a carpenter. He said he stole the pot from my house.
Prisoner's Defence I met an old shipmate that day he gave me some liquor; I did not know rightly what I was doing off.

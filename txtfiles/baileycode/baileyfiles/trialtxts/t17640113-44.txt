            . I am a watchman on Brewer's key


. On the 22d or 23d of last month, there were about 200 hogsheads of tobacco: I saw the prisoner and two more, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the forenoon, behind the crane: I got upon a hogshead, and saw a lad that was with the prisoner take out a knife, and cut open the bar of a hogshead; the prisoner and he pulled tobacco out, and put it on the ground, till they thought they had enough; then they went to putting it into their pockets: I went and took hold of the prisoner, and took some of the tobacco from his pocket, and some from off the ground, (produced in court); this is it.

            . I took the prisoner in custody, and took some of this tobacco out of his pocket; I asked him how he came to do such a thing? he said he saw other people do it, so he did it; here is 10 lb. weight of it in all.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw two men take some; they told me to take some, and these men came and took it away from me. I am a Frenchman
, I never was in London before.

CHARLES GOOD
. I am in partnership with George Richard Gainsford, and live in High-street, Borough. On the 14th of August the prisoner came and Slivered me this order—I am sure he is the same person—I delivered it to Nicholson—I have a customer named Russell, in White Hart-court, Lombard-street.





JOHN NICHOLSON
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 14th of August I received this note from Mr. Good—I selected the pieces of Irish cloth, and gave them to the prisoner—he went away with them—I have

not the least doubt about his being the person—the goods were worth 5l. 0s. 9d.
(Order read)—"To Messrs. Gainsford and Co. August 14th,—39. "Sir,—I shall feel obliged if you will send by bearer a couple of pieces of linen, to be 1s. 9d. or 2s. per yard, as Mrs. Russell, being in town will take the choice of one, and return the money for the same this evening, By so doing you will oblige yours respectfully, JOSEPH RUSSELL". White Hart-court, Lombard-street."





JOSEPH RUSSELL
. I live in White Hart-court, Lombard-street. The prisoner was in my employ about three years—he was not so on the 14th of August—he had left me twelve months—this order is not in my hand. writing—I never authorised the prisoner to get any goods for me at Gains-ford and Co.—I have seen the prisoner write—this order is very much like his hand-writing—I believe it to be his—I did not get the goods.

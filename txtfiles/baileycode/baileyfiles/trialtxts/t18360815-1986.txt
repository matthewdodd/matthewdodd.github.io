WILLIAM HENRY STREET

re-examined. I missed it about the 3rd of 10th—I could not have seen it on the 3rd—it was the Sunday previous—it is mine—it cost 10s. 6d.—it is now a good book.





WILLIAM DYKE
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 1st of August, in Greenwich—I asked him about taking books from this chapel—he said the books he took from this chapel he had pawned at Mr. Tighe's, at St. Paul's Deptford.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he say the books which had been taken from the chapel he pawned? A. The books he had taken—that was what he said—a young man named Copping lodged at his father's (Daniel Strain, Broadway, Deptford; Henry Hart, Malden-street, Greenwich; and John Beard, Church-street, Deptford; deposed to the prisoner's good character.)

             sworn.
On Friday, the 19th of December, at three or four o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop, to purchase a few articles, which she paid for. When she came in, I observed the piece of lutestring on the counter: she went out of the shop; I missed it as she was going out; I followed her, and took her about three or four yards from the shop; I brought her back, and took it from under her cloak; she said she picked it up in the front shop, and meant to bring it back again.
(Deposed to by Mr. Barlow.)
The prisoner called three witnesses to her character.




               GUILTY, Of stealing, but not privately
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

MATTHEW WOOD. I am a grocer
. On the 28th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Cheapside


 - a young gentleman told me something - I did not see the prisoner then, but I had seen him follow me for about a quarter of an hour - he was afterwards taken, and I know him to be the same man who had followed me - I lost my handkerchief, and have not seen it since.

            . I am under-beadle of the Ward of Cheap - I was coming, out of Bird-in-hand-court - the prisoner ran by, and hit me in the face - I knocked him down, and took him to the watch-house.

            . I am in my brother's employ - I saw the prosecutor in Cheapside, and the prisoner took the handkerchief from his pocket - he crossed the road - he saw me looking at him; and he smiled at me, which I thought was to convey an impression that it wasonly a joke - he then went up King-street - I went and told the prosecutor, we went up King-street, but could not see the prisoner - we returned to the corner of the street, and the prosecutor was telling the police of it - I saw the prisoner coming, along, and I said, "That is him" - he then ran off, and was taken by the beadle.
Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry, and ran, but I did not know they were going to take me.

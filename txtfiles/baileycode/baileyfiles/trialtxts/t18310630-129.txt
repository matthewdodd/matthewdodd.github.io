: I missed this pot off a shelf in the yard on the 16th of May - the prisoner was then in the privy, and I found the pot in his hat; this is it - I have known the prisoner about the place these five years; he is a labouring man, but had no beer in the house that day - I had met him about five minutes before, as I was going out for my pots - we have lost two dozen pots within the last two months.

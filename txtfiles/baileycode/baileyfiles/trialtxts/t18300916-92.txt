. On the 24th of July I was walking up Gracechurch-street, near Cornhill


, between ten and eleven o'clock; I felt something touch my pocket - I looked round, and observed the prisoner running towards Leadenhall-street; I called out that I had lost my handkerchief, and pursued him; a person pursued, and took him; I saw him throw the handkerchief into a cart.

!" I ran - he turned round, and threw this handkerchief into a waggon tail; I held him, and the officer took him.

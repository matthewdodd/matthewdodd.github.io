            . I am clerk to a gentleman in New-square On the 13th of August, I was looking out of the back window into Tavistock-square


; I saw a gentleman walking, and the prisoner took a handkerchief out of his pocket; I ran down, and tried to find the gentleman, but I could not; the prisoner was taken in three or four minutes.
Prisoner. Q. How high was the window? A. On the second floor; it was open; I swear you are the person who took it; I ran down and told the porter who was sitting on the bench; you could not have got away.

            . Mr. Lowe told me that the prisoner who was then crossing the square, had picked a gentleman's pocket; I pursued him; he ran through a passage into Serle-street, and threw the handkerchief into Mr. Green's passage - I pursued and took him in the next street; when I brought him back, a little girl had picked up this handkerchief and gave it me.
Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I saw the mob and ran with them; a gentleman stopped me, and the witness swore I picked the pocket, but I was not near the place.

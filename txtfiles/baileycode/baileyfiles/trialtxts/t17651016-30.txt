            : we are goldsmiths

: about five weeks ago my man missed a silver coffee-pot from out of a swing-frame: we looked, and found it was gone; and little thought of hearing of it again: last Saturday was sending, Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             sent me word that some person or persons had owned they had stole a silver coffee-pot from me: I went to Sir John, there were those boys at the bar, they owned they had stolen it; and the Jew that owned he had bought it of the boys: the Jew's name is 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Terachina 
               



            .


                  Abraham 
                  Terachina 
               



            . I bought a silver coffee-pot of the two prisoners at the bar, about five weeks ago.
Q. Where did you buy it?
Terachina. I bought it on the back part of Church-lane.
Q. What did you give them for it?
Terachina. I gave them 25 s. for that and a pair of tea-tongs: I had bought several things of them before.
Q. Who did you pay the money to?
Terachina. I paid it to Palmer.
Q. What is become of the pot?
Terachina. I sold it to a Jew for 35 s.
Prosecutor. It was a pint coffee-pot, worth about 3 l. odd.
Jones. We own we took the pot.
Palmer. We took the pot; but the Jew gave us but 16 s. for that and the tongs together.
Both

            . I keep the Manchester Arms, Adam-street, Manchester-square. On the 9th of August, the prisoner ran into my bar, produced three pint pots, and said,
"Here is three pint pots of yours." My name was not on them, but Mr. Bell's. I asked where she had them, she said
"Baker-street", and ran out. Bell immediately came in, and enquired for her. I pursued, and found her in Portman-square, I found three more pots in her apron.

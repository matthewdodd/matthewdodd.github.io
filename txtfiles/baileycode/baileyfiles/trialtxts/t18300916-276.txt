GEORGE DORMER. I am a wheelwright
. On the 13thof September I missed this clock when I went home to dinner at one o'clock; it was there at eight when I went out - I have never seen it since; I knew the prisoner, he is a clock-maker
, and lived in Somers'-town.

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the 13th of September the prisoner came, and said my father had sent him for the clock - I refused to let him have it; he said my father was at the Black Cap, Camden-town, and he met him for it - I went to the Black Cap - my father was not there; I said he should not take it - he said he would, and in taking it down he tore the pendulum out of my hand and took it away - he gave no reason for it.

            . I took the prisoner. He at first denied all knowledge of it, and then acknowledged he had taken it to another person, who had not returned it.
Prisoner's Defence The prosecutor and I dined together - he gave me orders to go and take his clock, and repair it.
GEORGE DORMER. I never dined with him that day - I had seen him once before, and he repaired it.

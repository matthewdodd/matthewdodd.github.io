JAMES AGER. I am a toll-collector
, and live in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate. On the 31st of August, about a quarter after one o'clock at night, I was returning from Lambeth - I was quite sober - I was close to White Hart-court, Long-lane, Smithfield


, the prisoner, and another man, met me, the prisoner pushed against me, and took my watch out of my fob-the other man was close behind him; I took hold of the prisoner's hand; I saw him turn his hand round to his companion. I gave him in charge. His companion came round and struck me, but I kept my hold. The prisoner also struck me several times in the face.

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Fetter-lane. I was passing through Long-lane, about ten minutes after one o'clock, and heard the alarm, I went up-when the prosecutor said, "you have drawn my watch," and called out. I saw him struggling with the prisoner. He said another man had taken it out of the prisoner's hand.

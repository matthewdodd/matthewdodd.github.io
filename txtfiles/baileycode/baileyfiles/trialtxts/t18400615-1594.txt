was indicted

for stealing, on the

Jane Lloyd.






JANE LLOYD.
I am a widow, and live in Carnaby-street. The prisoner came to my house on the 26th of March, and hired a ready furnished lodging, as a servant out of place—I accommodated her with my own room—she remained only that night—she said she should be there till she got a situation—I left her in the morning, and desired her to stop till I came back—I was gone a quarter of an hour, to the butcher's, and when I came back she was gone—I did not see her again till eleven weeks after—I lost

a watch, a cloak, and tablecloth—(examining one)—this is the cloak—I have not found the others.





BRIDGET O'CONNELL.
I am the wife of a policeman, and am searcher at the station-house. The prisoner was brought to the station-house—I found eleven duplicates on her—one referred to this cloak.





SAMUEL HAIL.
I am in the service of a pawnbroker, in Crawfordstreet. I produce this cloak—I do not know who pawned it—this is the duplicate of it.





CHARLES WEBB
(police-constable C61.) The prisoner was causing a disturbance in Carnaby-street, at a pork-butcher's—I went up to her and requested her to go away—she would not—I took her towards the station house—the prosecutrix came out, and said that was the person that robbed her of several articles.

Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the prosecutrix till she gave me in charge; I never lodged in Carnaby-street in my life.

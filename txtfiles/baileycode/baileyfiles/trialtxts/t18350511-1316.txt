HARRIET AUGUSTA TANNER
. I live in New-street, City-road, and am a widow. I occasionally employ the prisoner Henry—on the 21st of April, I sent him for a truck—there was a large easy chair placed on it—I told him to follow me with it to Cheapside, where we took eight dining-room chairs in the truck—we then went on to High-street, St. Giles's—I then went into a house, and when I came out I saw the prisoner turn into Oxford-street—I followed, and could not see him—I inquired of a policeman, but could not hear of him—I took an omnibus, thinking I should find him, but I did not—I returned home at half-past four o'clock—he had not come—I gave directions to the police, at eight o'clock; and the next morning a policeman took me to where I found the chairs had been sold—I manufacture furniture, but do not keep a shop.





WILLIAM SMITH
. I live at No. 94, York-street, Westminster. On the 21st of April, the prisoner, Richard, came between three and four

o'clock in the afternoon, with these nine chairs on a truck—he asked me to buy them, which I did, for 6l.—I can order them, and get them for 7l.—I could buy this arm-chair for 50s., and these other eight for 4l. 10s.—they are Honduras wood.

Prisoner. I went along Cheapside, and then up to Oxford-street—I then missed my mistress—I went back to see for her, and when I returned the truck was gone.
(Frederick Henry Brown, the prosecutirx's brother, gave the prisoner a good character.)

RICHARD HENLEY—

Transported for Seven Years.

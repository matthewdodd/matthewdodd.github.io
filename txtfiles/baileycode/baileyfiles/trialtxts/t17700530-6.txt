             were indicted for

            , the property of a certain person unknown, April 5
. +
Wil. Bradshaw. I was at work near Shackle-well


, at the Cock and Castle. On the 5th of April I saw Gregory upon a house, taking some lead off; I then did not know who the house belonged to. I was gone about twenty or thirty minutes, and when I came back, I saw him helping it upon Jackson's back in a sack. I let them go towards London, and when they were got about twenty or forty yards by me, I said to 
               
                  John
                   Pain
               



            , these men have been robbing that house of lead. He ran and laid hold of them; I followed him, and brought them back with the lead.

. On the 12th of August, about a quarter to nine o'clock, the prisoner and another person came and called for a pint of beer, which they drank in the tap-room. This table was in the back parlour; a person going into the yard might slip into the parlour. I saw the prisoner go out with it in half an hour; I ran out, and caught him under the bar-window, outside, with it under his arm. The other man ran away.

Prisoner's Defence. I took it out to have a drop of beer on, there being so many people in the tap-room, and nobody being in the parlour, it was dull - my friend laid me a pot of beer I could not get it out without being hindered.

            . I am a glassman, and live in Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I saw the prisoners following Mr. Lobb, who was with a lady, by my door - I followed them about twenty yards and saw Keefe take the handkerchief from his pocket, and give it to Connory, who put it into his pocket. I secured them both, and gave them to my father, who took it from Connory, while I went to Mr. Lobb.
Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do not you very often come here as a witness? A. I was here six months ago; I have been here six or seven times, about robberies which I saw committed; I had seen Keefe before. My father was a constable of St. Giles'; it was done under the arch-way, between three and four o'clock - I was about twenty yards from them; nobody was between me and them.
CONNORY'S Defence. I was under the arch-way, and picked it up.
KEEFE's Defence. I was passing along, when he took me.
CONNORY - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.
KEEFE -

On the 7th of October I was at the corner of Fish-street Hill, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner passing by me, and shuffling something into his pocket—I took hold of his collar, and said, "You have got my handkerchief," he said, "I have not"—I said You have"—I seized him by both arms, and my handkerchief fell from him—this is it (looking at it.)

Prisoner's Defence. I saw a gentleman with two boxes—I was running to ask him to let me carry one—I pushed up against the prosecutor and he laid hold of MR.

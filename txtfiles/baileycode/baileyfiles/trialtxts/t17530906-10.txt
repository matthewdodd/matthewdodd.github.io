, the prisoner lodged with me in ready furnished lodgings at 1 s. 6 d. per week; about the 15th of August she had a clean pair of sheets, and my wife asked her for the foul ones, which were not to be produced; I then went and got a gimblet, and bored a hole in the wainscot, thro' which we saw the quilt was gone, and afterwards we missed the pillow, sheets and looking glass. She was taken up and had before the justice, there she confessed where the goods were, and I went along with her and found them at two pawnbrokers.

The prisoner had nothing to say for herself.

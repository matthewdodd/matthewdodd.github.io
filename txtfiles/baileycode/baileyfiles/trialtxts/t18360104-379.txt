STEPHEN FARMER
 (police-constable T 72.) I was on duty at Ealing and met the prisoner, on the 29th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, in Old Brentford, about there miles and a half from Mr. Street's, carrying a basket on his shoulder—I asked what he had got—he made no answer, but dropped the basket on the pavement—he attempted to run away—I took him, and found this lead in the basket.





THOMAS ROSE
. I am in the service of Thomas Street, Esq.—he lives at Ealing. He had a pump in his stable-yard—it was safe on Tuesday week, and this day week it was gone—I have fitted this lead to the pump—it had been taken from there—it corresponded in all respectes—I have no doubt it is the lead of the pump.

Prisoner. He said, when I was taken, that he could not swear to it, and the policeman said he must swear—they remanded me till the next day—then he came and said he could swear to it—Mr. Street has been transported for life.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

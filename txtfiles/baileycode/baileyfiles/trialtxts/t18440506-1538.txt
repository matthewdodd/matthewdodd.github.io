1538. 




GEORGE EMERY
 and 




GEORGE GREENWOOD
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 coat, value 10s., the goods of 



William Appleyard, and that Emery had been before convicted of felony.






HARRIET APPLEYARD
. I am the wife of William Appleyard. I live in Prince's-yard, Lambeth—a coat belonging to my son Septimus, who is sixteen years old, hung in the back parlour at a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning—I did not miss it till Goff came—this is it.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFF
 (police-constable L 83.) About nine o'clock on Thursday morning, the 2nd of May, I saw the prisoners in company in Hercules-buildings—I saw Emery open a gate of a house—he was going in, but a person was going along the passage—he came back and joined Greenwood—they went on and passed the prosecutor's house and returned—then Emery went back, and Greenwood went up the court by the side of the house, leaned over the rails, and looked into the passage while Emery went in—then Emery came out with a bundle, which he gave to Greenwood—I took the bundle and found it was this coat.






WILLIAM COOMBS
 (police-constable D 94.) I produce a certificate of Emery's fromer conviction, which I got from the Sessions-house, Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

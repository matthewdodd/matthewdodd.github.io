JAMES THOMAS HORNER. I live at Camberwell


. I had upwards of thirty pigeons - on the 8th of July I missed them all; they had been taken early that morning or late the night before - I saw two of them in the Borough that afternoon, and fourteen in Leadenhall-market; six were dead and eight alive - I swear they were mine - two of them are here.

            . I live with Mr. Glover, in Leadenhall-market. I bought the pigeons of the prisoner, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, on the 8th of July - I gave him 3s. 6d. for six live ones, and 6d. for ten smothered ones - we buy any thing that is brought to market and offered for sale, if we know it not to be stolen - I inquired of the prisoner, and he said he brought them from his home, at Camberwell.
Prisoner. Q. Did not you say two boys came to sell them? A. Yes; you had six live ones, and the other had ten in a bag.

            . I was in the shop - the prisoner sold six live pigeons, and the other ten dead ones.
Prisoner. I know nothing about them.

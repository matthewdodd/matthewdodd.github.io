                     Brown
                  



               
             and 
               
                  
                     Peter 
                     Beby
                  



               
            , of St. John the Evangelist



, were indicted, the former for 


               feloniously stealing a Holland-Apron, and other Goods, value 8 s.
             the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Edward 
                     Windhurst
                  



               
            , the 24th of July 

last; and the latter for 


               receiving the said Goods, knowing them to be stolen
            .
It appear'd by the Evidence that the Prisoner was Servant
 to the Prosecutor, and stole the Goods. The Fact being plainly prov'd against Eleanor Brown, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.
             but there not being sufficient Evidence that Peter Beby (to whom they were pawn'd) at the time of receiving them, did know them to have been stolen, the Jury 

               acquitted
             him.

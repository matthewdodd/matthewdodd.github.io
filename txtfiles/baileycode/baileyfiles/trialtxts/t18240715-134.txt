            . I was in Gracechurch-street


 yesterday, and my handkerchief was stolen out of my right-hand coat pocket - I did not know it till the officer told me I was robbed - I saw the handkerchief this morning at the Mansion-House.
CAARLES HERDSFIELD. I saw the prisoner in Gracechurch-street, near Leadenhall-street: the prosecutor stopped to look at a picture-shop; some ladies stopped at the same time. I could not see the prisoner take the handkerchief, but immediately afterwards I saw him coming away, with something in his small-clothes; I took him, and found this handkerchief there.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I did it through distress.

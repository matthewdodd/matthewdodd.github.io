                   knight, value 6d. and five other books, value 5s.
             the goods of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  King 
               




            , May 6th

                  Thomas 
                  King 
               



            . On the 6th of May I lost these books in my shop window.


                  George 
                  King 
               



            . I saw the prisoner cover these books with a brown linen apron in my brother's shop window, and he took them off the window and carried them I believe twenty or thirty yards. I was in the street and saw him take them: there was another person with the prisoner; but the Grand jury have not thought proper to find the bill against him. 

               Guilty

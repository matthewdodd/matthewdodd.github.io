            . On the 19th of January, about four o'clock, I was in Jermyn-street


, and was told my handkerchief was gone. I then missed it from my coat pocket; it was safe when I was in the Haymarket. The prisoner was pointed out to me, and I stopped him at the corner of St. James's-court, and charged him with having my handkerchief. He said he had not got it; I said,
"But you took it;" he said,
"I don't know any thing about it." I took him to the watch-house - it was not found; it was a yellow one.

            . I am a carman. I was in Jermyn-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man, following Mr. Wilson for twenty yards - then one of them took a yellow handkerchief out of Mr. Wilson's pocket. I ran across the road, and pointed the prisoner out to Wilson, and the other went off - they were close together, in company.

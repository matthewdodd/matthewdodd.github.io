WALTER HOLIDAY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of September, 12 half-crown, and 10 shillings, the monies of 



Thomas Bullock, his master.






THOMAS BULLOCK
. I live at Stratford, in the parish of West Ham, and am a master baker. I sent the prisoner for five quarters of bran, on the 19th of September, to Mr. Carpenter's Steam-mills, at Bromley—to the best of my recollection I gave him twelve half-crown and ten shillings to pay for it—he did not bring it home—he said he had paid for four quarters, and delivered it to a customer of mine, and be returned me 8s. for one quarter—there was then twelve half-crowns and two shillings missing—I had occasion to send to the same mill the next Wednesday, and then the demand was made for four quarters of bran, 1l. 5s. 6d.—he had obtained three quarters—it appeared it had risen from the time that I had the last—he gave me neither the bran nor the money.





CHARLES HAGEN
. I am servant to Mr. Carpenter. The prisoner came on the 19th of some bran—he asked for three quarters, which came to 1l. 5s. 6d.—he did not pay for it—he had nothing else—we have since made a demand on Mr. Bullock for the money.





JAMES SMART
. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner—I asked him what he had done with his master's money?—he said he had paid it away to person that he owed it to.





THOMAS BULLOCK

re-examined. Nobody has paid me for this bran—he was to deliver three quarters to Mr. Johnson, which he did, but he told me he had delivered four quarters to him.




GUILTY
. Aged 24—


Transported for Seven Years.

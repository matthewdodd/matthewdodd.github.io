            . I am servant to Thomas Harland, a cheesemonger
, of St. John-street, Clerkenwell


. On the 15th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, my boy was going out to take some cheese, and gave me information; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner with this cheese, going from the shop; the boy took hold of him, and brought him back; we took it from him - he said he would never do the like again. Mr. Harland let him go, and in about half an hour he returned, and took another piece out of the window; Hocker brought him back, and I took it from under his coat - he was a little in liquor.

            . I am a butcher, and live opposite the prosecutor. On Saturday afternoon I was at my door, and saw the prisoner brought back with the cheese; they pardoned him, and he left; but in about twenty minutes I saw him return, and go staggering up to the shop; he took this piece of cheese with a ticket on it - he deliberately took the ticket off, and put the cheese under his arm; I crossed over, collared him, and took him back.

            . I am an officer, and took him in charge; I found a picture and an Italian iron on him.
The prisoner put in a written defence, pleading intoxication.

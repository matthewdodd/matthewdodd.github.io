GEORGE JONES, alias
 Edmund Harrison

, and 




THOMAS SHELDON
, were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
23rd of Sept., 1 looking-glass and stand, value 8s., the goods of 



Edward John Gairdner; and that Jones had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES HORNE
. I live in Tottenham-court-road. On the 23rd of Sept, about nine o'clock, I was at home, and looking across the road, saw the prisoners loitering about the prosecutor's house—then Sheldon went in, and brought out the glass, which he gave to Jones, who waited outside—I came down stairs, crossed the road, and followed them—I took Sheldon, who then had the glass in his hand—he must have received it back from Jones while I came down stairs—I found them together—the prosecutor's man was at the back of the shop.





WILLIAM JOHN BRIGHTMAN
. I am servant to Edward John Gairdner, who keeps an open broker's shop in Tottenham-court-road. This is his glass, and was in the shop.





DAVID QUARY
 (policeman.) I took him in charge.

Jones's Defence. I met this lad; he said he was going to look for a situation; I went with him; he went into the shop. I was not aware of his taking the glass.

Sheldon's Defence. I was at work with my father, and went to look after a place; this roan persuaded me to take the glass; if it had not been for him, I should not have done it.





WILLIAM DARBY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of Jones's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I know him to be the man.

JONES—

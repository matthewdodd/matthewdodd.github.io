            . I am a carpenter. On the 10th of September, I was in Felton-street, Hoxton, and saw the prisoner in some buildings in Harvey-street


. I went to the house, and took him on the staircase, with two saws in his hand. He got up on the floor. I asked what business he had there. He threw the saws down, and jumped out of the first floor window. I ran round and caught him. He denied having anything else, but as we went along he dropped a rule, which I picked up, and delivered to Gosbell.

            . I am a carpenter
. I was employed in this house. The rule and one of the saws are mine. I found the saw in the well-hole.

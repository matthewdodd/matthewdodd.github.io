            . I am a servant to Mr. Carrington. On the 24th of July, between three and four in the afternoon, I heard a person come down stairs, I ran into the passage, and saw the prisoner go out, I asked her what she had got there she said nothing; I asked her where she had been, she said no where, and when she found I would call somebody in, she said if I would not call any body in she would give me the tea-tray, she then pulled it from under her gown and petticoat. This is the tea-tray, it is my master's property, it was in the corner of the one pair of stairs, she said she found it on the stairs

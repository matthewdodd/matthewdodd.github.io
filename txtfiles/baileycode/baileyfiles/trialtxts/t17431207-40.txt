            . The 24th of October I landed 200 Bolts of Canvass, for Mr. Foster; about two o'Clock in the Afternoon there was a Cry upon the Keys, that an Officer was charged with a Man for stealing a Piece of Canvas; I looked, and there was a piece missing.

            . When I came from Dinner I was informed, that this Man had put a Bolt of Canvas upon a Stair-case; I took hold of him, and asked him how he came to put it there; he said, some of the Company's Men called out, who would work; that he was employed in the Work, and found the Canvas upon the Stairs.
Thomas Green . I saw the Prisoner carrying a Bolt of Canvas up a Stair-case close by the Water-side, and Mr. Read said, it was Mr. Foster's Canvas. 


               Guilty, 10 d.

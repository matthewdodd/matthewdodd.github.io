            . I am the wife of Obadiah Webb, and live in Globe-lane, Mile-end


. Between ten and eleven o'clock on the morning of the 13th of March I was cleaning my door and went down for some water, leaving the street door open; I heard a noise, ran out, and saw the prisoner at my room door with a basket in his hand; he asked if I wanted any lemons - I looked into the room and missed my watch; I ran after him - the neighbours stopped him; I am quite certain of his person - he threw the watch away.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was standing in Globe-lane, about half-past ten o'clock, on the 13th of March, and saw the prisoner run, and some oranges rolling about the street - I saw him throw something away with a ribbon to it - I went to the place, and found this watch, which I gave to the officer.

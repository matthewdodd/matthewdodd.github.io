            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are carman to Mr. Brickwood. - A. Yes.
Q. Was the prisoner foreman
 to Mr. Brickwood. - A. Yes.
Q. On the 12th of January did he give you any order. - A. It was on a Monday; I cannot say as to the time.
Q. How long was it before he was taken up. - A. I believe it was nine or ten days before he was taken up. He gave me an order to draw ten quarters of beans to Mr. Keeps; in consequence of that order I put them into sacks into Mr. Brickwood's storehouse; then we loaded them in the cart.
Q. How many sacks were there. - A. Twenty sacks. I drew them to the New Cut windmill, Blackfriar's-road


, to Mr. Keep.
Q. Is that the paper that the prisoner gave you. - A. I believe he folded it up; I put it in my pocket, I never looked at it, I gave it to Mr. Keep.
Q. Did you deliver the beans to Mr. Keep. - A. Yes, I left the beans and the sacks there.
Q. Had you any money. - A. I had the shooting money, a shilling.

                  BRICKWOOD
               



            . Q. What are you, sir. A. I am a cornfactor and corn-merchant
 living at Broken wharf; the prisoner was my foreman.
Q. In the month of January last you had a considerable quantity of beans in your granary. - A. I had.
Q. After you had made this discovery, did you endeavour to ascertain what quantity was deficient. - A. I did; the whole of my deficiency I cannot speak to; I am certain of above forty quarters.
Q. What is the value of a quarter. - A. Forty shillings a quarter.
Q. Were you present when the prisoner and Keep were examined at the office. - A. I was. I can swear that this was the paper that was given by Keep himself to the magistrate; I have no doubt of its being the prisoner's hand-writing; I have seen him write several times.
Q. When the corn is delivered out of your granary, is it usual to give written bills. - A. I have met with instances where there have not been any printed bills ready at hand; but the foreman never fills up notes. They are filled up by the clerk or myself. (The note read.)
Q. Was it the business of the prisoner as your foreman, to send out any corn without your knowledge, or the clerk's. - A. Certainly not.
Q. Whenever he sends out any corn, is it the custom to make any entry in the book. - A. It is his duty to enter it in the delivery book; the clerk usually fills up the notes, and enters it in another book, and that is a check to the other.
Q. Have you any entry on the 12th of January, of beans sent to Mr. Keep, New Cut windmill. - A. There is no such entry in the whole book; I never knew any thing of him till after the discovery of this transaction.
Q. I do not know whether you are able to ascertain any loss of your sacks. - A. Not particularly; I saw nine sacks produced at the office with my name on them; there were twenty brought, in which the beans went in.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Have you any partners. - A. I have not.
Q. I understood you to state to my friend, that these bills of sale are usually printed. - A. The tickets that are sent by the carman are usually printed
Q. And sometimes I understand that they are not. - A. There may have been twice in seven years, if the clerk had not any bills at hand, that he has wrote them. I had but one clerk then, and he was at the Corn-exchange with me; it was impossible for him to have wrote it, and every foreman is positively ordered not to deliver any goods without an order from me or the clerk.

            . I am a police officer.
Mr. Gurney. Did you search the New Cut, Keep's mill. - A. I did; I found these nine sacks there, they have Mr. Brickwood's name on them in full length.


                  JOHN 
                  WOODCOCK
               



            . Q. I believe you lived at the New Cut mill on the 12th of January last. - A. Yes. I saw twenty sacks of whole beans come in on that day.
Q. What was done with them. - A. They were split; they came in Mr. Brickwood's sacks.
The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.

            . I am a single woman; I have a house in Downing-street, St. Margaret's, Westminster


.
Q. Did you reside there at the time that you lost the things out of the house - A. No; the last time that I slept in the house was on the Jubilee night; since that night I have not slept there. The prisoner lived servant

 with me two months before her husband came home, and when he came home I gave him leave to be there. The prisoner left my service in January, and they left my house on the 1st of March; I went to my house on the Monday following; I know every thing was safe at five o'clock in the afternoon; I locked up the house; then I went to Cork-street to my mother, and on Thursday I learned from my mother that the house had been robbed.
Q. In consequence of that information did you go there - A. Yes, on Friday; I went there with Gillmore the officer; I discovered two feather beds gone, three looking glasses, two of them swing looking glasses, a counterpane, a blanket, a gown, and three sets of bed furniture.
Q. Those things you missed, how lately had you seen them before - A. Not since the Monday I was there. I have not recovered any of the property since.
Q. Had you ever lived in this house yourself - A. Yes. I had rented it two years last November; the last time I slept in it was the night of the illumination; I had not slept in the house before that time for a twelvemonth Mr. Templer lived in it a twelvemonth; it had been shut up for a twelvemonth prior to the illumination night, except a fortnight, it was let as a lodging house. Butcher and his wife went to live in it about the 21st of January. I considered Cork-street my home; I slept in Cork-street a twelvemonth, except on the Jubilee night. It is my house in Cork-street.
ANN HICKMAN. I live in Downing-street, two doors from Mrs. Atkins house.

Q. 
            Do you know the two prisoners - A. I know them both by sight. On the 6th of March I was looking out of the two pair of stair window, about twelve o'clock in the day; I saw a hackney coach stand in the gateway of the stable-yard that goes, into the Treasury; I saw the prisoners come from under the gateway and put some things into a hackney coach; a bird cage, a swing glass, and a cat. Mrs. Atkin's back door comes out into that stable-yard.

            . I am daughter of the last witness; I saw the two prisoners first, and called my mother. I saw a coach standing in the gateway; it was Wednesday or Thursday the 5th, 6th, or 7th of March; I saw a bed given to the coach man to put into the coach, and that man gave the coachman a glass of gin.
Q. What man was that. - A. I did not see the man: I saw the coachman draw the bed, and put it into the coach, and after that I saw a man bring a bird cage.
Q. Look round and see whether you know him. - A. Yes, I saw this man, these two prisoners go into the coach; I saw the man prisoner put a swing glass and bird cage into the coach.
Q. Did you see where the coachman got the bed from. - No; the coachman came from under the archway, and put the bed into the coach, and then came the man and woman, and they both went into the coach, and away they drove.

            . I am an officer of Queen-square office; I apprehended both the prisoners; I searched their apartments; I found nothing there; I told the man I took him into custody for taking away the things out of the house in Downing-street; I asked how he brought away his own things out of Downing-street. He told me, in a coach; he had a few rags of his own, he said; a small trunk and a bird-cage.

            's Defence. When I went home, my wife was crying; she said her mistress had been there making a noise. When I came away from Flushing, I had some money to take. I said, you had better take a hackney-coach, and carry your things to your father's; go to your mistress, and let her see that every thing is safe. I wish I had taken the number of the hackney-coach when I took my wife's things away; it would have been a good thing for me.

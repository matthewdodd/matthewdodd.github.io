On the 13th of April I had a basket of bread on a barrow—I went to Regent-square—I left it there to go serve a few customers farther on—I left fifteen loaves altogether—I was away from ten to fifteen minutes—when I returned I missed nine loaves—the basket was left—I received information and went after the prisoner—I found the nine loaves produced in his basket—I asked him what he had been doing—he said, "Taking my bread"—I took him.





JOHN SMYTH
. I am a baker—I was with the prosecutor in Regent-square. I observed the prisoner running away, a few yards from where the barrow was—I saw him brought back with the loaves in his possession.

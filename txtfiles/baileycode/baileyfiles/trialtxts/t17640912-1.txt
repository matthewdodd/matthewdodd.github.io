            . I am a gang's-man on Fresh-wharf-key


. On the 16th of August, I went down on the key, and observed several people about the hogs-heads; on seeing me, they went away, and the prisoner staid after them. I went and found a hoop stuck in a hole of a hogshead, where he had been puddling. I observed his pocket heavy, and took him to an alehouse and searched him, and found five pounds and a half of sugar in his pocket; he said, other people had taken more than he had.

Prisoner's Defence.
A man desired me to help him up with a parcel: I saw this sugar lying on the ground; he bid me take it up, which I did, rather than it should be lost.

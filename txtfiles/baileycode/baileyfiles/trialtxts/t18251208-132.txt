ELIZABETH FIELD. I am a widow
, and keep a secondhand clothes shop
 in Monmouth-street


. Reardon brought the prisoner to my shop on the 4th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the evening - he had no coat on, and was rather meanly dressed; he requested to be allowed to put his coat on; Reardon said I had lost a coat, which he had got under his arm. I looked at the side of my door, and missed a black coat, which I had seen safe at five o'clock - I looked at the sleeves and collar, and know it.(Property produced and sworn to).

            . On the 4th of November, I saw the prisoner in company with two others; they went to this shop, and one of the others put his hand inside the door, and took the coat, which he handed to the prisoner; he took it into Nag's Head-court, and was folding it up. I ran over and took hold of him, and rushed forward and took his companion; they both struck and kicked me, and the prisoner's companion got away. I took the prisoner and the coat back to the shop.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see this young man do anything about the shop himself? A. No; he went by two or three times. I did not tell him I would bellows him; the boy who took the coat got away by striking me.

            . I was near the place, and Reardon called me to take the coat.

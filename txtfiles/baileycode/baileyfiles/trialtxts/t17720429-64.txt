            . I am a waterman
, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, out of my boat at Hungerford Stairs


, the 2d of March. On the 6th of March I saw the prisoner with my waistcoat on, sitting and he shammed sleep; I waked him and asked him, how he came by that waistcoat; he said what is that to you; I said, ah Tom, I did not think that of you.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have nothing to say for myself but guilty.

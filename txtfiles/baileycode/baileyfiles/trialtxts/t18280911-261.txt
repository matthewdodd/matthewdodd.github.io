DAVID HYAMS. I am a clothes-dealer
, and live in Wardour-street


. I was at my door on the 8th of August - I saw somebody put a hand in, and take a hat from my door; I did not see who it was, but I went out and saw the prisoner running - I called Stop thief! and my neighbour brought him back; the prisoner ran about thirty houses - I saw him stopped; I have not recovered the hat - there was another boy whom I saw.

            . I live with my father near the prosecutor's. On the 8th of August I saw the prisoner take the hat out and give it to his companion, who ran off; I did not see which way he ran, but I saw the prisoner run - I am sure he did not walk; I was looking out of window - I came running down to the door; I am sure the prisoner is the boy who took it.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up the street, and saw people running - I ran, and a man stopped me.

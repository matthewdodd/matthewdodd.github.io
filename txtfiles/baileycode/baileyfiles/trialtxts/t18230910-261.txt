            . I live at Bayswater, and am not in business. On the 13th of August I was crossing George-street, St. Giles's


 - I felt my coat skirt moving - turned round, and saw the prisoner attempting to throw my handkerchief into a door-way - it fell on his heels - I picked it up and secured him; he resisted violently; anda crowd of dangerous characters collected, and tried to rescue him. I forced him into a shop, and was obliged to hold the doors against them. The shopkeeper refused to send for a constable till I threatened him. He begged of me several times to let him go, saying he would not do it again.
JAMES KENDRICK. I am a constable. I was fetched, and found the prosecutor surrounded by a parcel of pickpockets, men, women, and boys. I took the prisoner in charge, and asked if he could not leave off his old tricks - he made no answer.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. The other people were as likely to take it as me.

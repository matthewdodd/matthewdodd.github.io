            . On Thursday, the 11th of March, both the prisoners came into my shop; Williams asked me what I would make him a fustian jacket for, I said 7 s. I looked at them very hard - he turned to Johnson and said
"I only gave 3 s. for this" (which he had on) they went out leaving the door open. I shut the door - I saw Williams take off his hat and talk to Johnson. I missed the buttons from the window, and went in pursuit; I found them in about an hour - they ran off. I called Stop thief! Williams threw off his hat, and was brought to me with the buttons; I charged him with taking them - they said nothing.

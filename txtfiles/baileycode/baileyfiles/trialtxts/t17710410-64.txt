             was indicted for

; in his evidence upon the trial of captain


                           Richard

                  , for the murder of 
                     
                        Thomas

            . I attended at the last Admiralty sessions, and took down, in short hand, the trial of captain 
               
                  Richard
                   Broad
               



            . The prisoner at the bar was principal witness against the captain, who was then tried for the murder of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Scott
               



            . The prisoner deposed that he was a formast-man, on board the King David, that captain Broad was then first mate, and Scott fourth mate. That he saw captain Broad knock Scott down twice with a blunderbuss, near the windlass; that then he struck the cock in his breast twice; that he then punched him three or four times with the butt end, into his belly; and then turned the mussel of the gun, and struck him in the belly; that Scott died in less than 24 or 28 hours. That he had no assistance, but lay where he fell; and that Wheeler and Osgood were there and saw him. That he really believed the blows were mortal at the time they were given; and that every one that was there thought so too. That he asked captain Broad to let the surgeon bleed him, he said d - n you, you bouger, if you be not quiet I will serve you in the same manner. Upon his cross examination, he said, it was between four and five in the afternoon; that it was broad day-light then, being in the month of July. That several blows were given him before he came. He said, that the captain knocked him down twice with the blunderbuss; that he got up and was knocked down again. He said he first struck him on the head; afterwards, he said, the first blow was in the stomach; then he said, he was knocked down both ways, both times; he could not say whether he struck him on the breast or the head with the second blow; but was certain he was knocked down with the blunderbuss in the stomach that was the first way; the punching with the cock was upon his breast, and that he punched him with the muzzle in his belly; he said, the occasion of it was, they had a shower of rain, and Scott had gone off the deck to shelter himself out of the rain; that Broad beat him upon the deck, and used him very ill, because he was off the deck. He was asked, how he could reconcile that, he said, he could not; he had said the man remained twenty-eight hours one time, and twenty-four another; being asked which he would stand to, he said to the forty-eight-hours; he was sure he did not live longer than that; that he said twenty-four in a short way for brevity sake: the truth being forty-eight hours. two whole days and nights; that all the ship's crew that were left saw him lie upon the deck in that condition, but no one could assist him; that Broad d - d him; in regard to Doughty that he never spoke to the captain about Scott, but when he said the captain d - d him he meant about Doughty; that he did not say a word to Broad about Scott, or to the surgeon's mate, or any body; that he called for no assistance, and no body offered him assistance but one Whallen and Drinkwater; what he said about the captain's denying his assistance, was in respect to Doughty; that Scott was speechless all the while; that he never heard him speak from receiving the blow; that he could not be always with him, but did apprehend he was unable to speak, and continued so during all the time; and that Osgood was upon the deck at the time the thing happened; but he did not remember any body else that was. That nobody did interpose, because they durst not speak for themselves. That the last words he ever heard from Scott, was the day before he used; he said, for God's sake, if you live to go home to Bristol, remember me to my wife and family; then he was bid to remember that two minutes before he swore that the man was speechless from the time he was knocked down till he died. His answer was, He told me that; he was then asked, if he had forgot what he said just now, that from the last time of his being struck down, he never spoke any more; his answer was, I never heard him speak after the last words; he died the day after he said this. The blows were the day before that of the conversation; he was asked if he did not say he was speechless from that time. His answer was, Not the time after he spoke to him; he never spoke in his hearing but once. Then he was asked, if he did not swear just now, that from the second time he was struck down he never heard him speak one word, and believed he was speechless. His answer was, I might say so, he was speechless; but the time he saw him and spoke to him, he said he was in a very bad condition, and died with the blows: that he looked at his breast and it was both black and blue, and he was swelled both on the right and left side of his breasts; he looked at him before he died. At the time he spoke to him. he opened his breasts; that he looked at him once in four or five hours which was as often as he could; that he did not look at his blows at any other time till he sewed him up; that he opened his cloaths at first when he spoke to him, but saw no other blow but upon his breast: that Scott told him he thought his death was owing to this blow: the words he used was, I am a dying man, and said, Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             was the cause of his death: that he did not tell the Surgeon when he saw that blow upon his breast, because the prisoner would not allow the Medicines to be of any use: he said, that at the end of the forty eight hours Scott died, and he sewed him up in a bit of canvas, and threw him over board five days before they got to Jamaica: that when he came to Jamaica he told Admiral 
               
                  Parry
               


             of it; that he was on board the man of war four days before they failed: that he went on board the man of war on the twenty-second, and on the twenty-sixth they failed; that he told this to Admiral 
               
                  Parry
               


             the day he went on board; that the Admiral told him he would take care of him in London; that when he was sent for he came up here; that the Admiral had not time to do any thing at Jamaica, as he waited for the Commodore; and when he came in was obliged to fail: that the Commodore came unexpectedly, because they had expected him several days: that the admiral could not look into this matter before, because he was getting his things on board; that he had no more talk with Admiral 
               
                  Parry
               


             about this matter; that he went to Portsmouth, and there the ship was laid up, and he was paid off. He was then asked whether he did ever say till this hour that he ever told this story to admiral Parry. His answer was he repeated it twenty times on board the ship to admiral Parry, and his Lady and Daughter. He said he did not acquaint Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             of the murder; that the admiral challenged him with the story about the murder twenty times in their passage home, and that he acquainted the admiral with it when he entered. He says, that he did not say that after he left the harbour he never said a word about it; that he was discharged at Portsmouth in September; and got to Bristol the latter end of September: and then went to his brother and sister Commings. He said he did not know Scott's brother at Jamaica; he was not acquainted with him; he was on board a man of war and could not go on shore to tell his brother what was become of him He said he did not tell the admiral that this man had a brother at Port royal; Scott, he said, told him many a time he had a brother there, but he made no enquiry about it: he said from seeing his relations at Bristol, he went the next day to Mr. Miller's, one of the owners; that Mr Miller asked him if ever Capt. Broad used him ill; he said, he never lifted up his finger against him in his life. Mr. Miller asked him whether Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             had used the sellers ill; he said, he would not let Mr. Miller know any thing of it, if he had let him into the light of every thing, Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             would never have been in London. The Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             had been in gentleman at knew himself not guilty, he would not he come home in private. For he said he stole he river in the night; that he did not that he had to say of Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             at that time to Mr. Miller; because he thought would put him out of the way; tho' he is never saw any harm of Mr. Miller He said he never mentioned any thing to Mr. Miller of Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


            's using the men ill; and then afterwards said that all he had said was false. He said he was of opinion that never a one of the twenty-seven men that died on board the ship died a natural death. He was asked if the Captain sunk the ship; he said as to the Captain sinking the ship he did not know any thing about it, that was best known to himself; he did not belong to her then; for had left him before the ship was lost; that a great many slaves were lost all of them through the bad usage of Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


            ; for between him and his mates they lost two hundred and seventy-seven blacks; that he had seen him in the morning, before ever he got his breakfast and dinner, kill eight or nine slaves; that he beat them to death: that it was nothing for him to kill eight or nine men before breakfast. He said he killed them as fast as he could. [The Council for the crown gave up the cause and Commings was committed to Newgate by the Court for Perjury.

                  Parry
               


            ;
Q. Do you remember she defendant's coming on board your ship at Jamaica?
A. I do not; because, being commanding officer, I am seldom on board.
Q. Do you remember seeing him on board?
A. I do not recollect him; from the multiplicity of seamen under my command, I cannot recollect him.
Q. Do you know of any man's telling you of the murder of Scott at Jamaica by Capt. Broad?
A. If such a complaint had been made to me I should have put him into custody there, and had him tried by a high court of Admiralty there; he never spoke a word to me.
Q. You can be very certain that this man never mentioned it to you?
A. I do not know the man; I am certain I never heard it from any man.
Q. He says he repeated it to you coming home.
A. I never heard of it.
Mr. Miller. I was a principal owner of the King David; I know the prisoner at the bar.
Q. Do you remember his coming to Bristol after having been upon the coast of Calabar?
Mr. Miller. On the latter end of September I was in my counting house; the prisoner at the bar, together with another sailor, waited upon me to demand their wages for their service on board the King David; at that time the ship was hourly expected; it turned out afterwards she waited for a freight, I asked if the ship was come in; he said, No, he came home on board the Preston man of war. I said, Have you deserted the ship? I turned to Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


            's letter, and found that he was put down in that letter as entered on board a man of war. I said, You are a pretty fellow to leave the ship at such a time, after so great a mortality, and put us to straits to navigate the ship; for we buried, I think, upon the coast of Calabar and to Jamaica seven or nine and twenty white men of the crew. The original crew was about forty, and about two hundred and seventy-seven negroes. Commings said, they left the ship for bad usage; that there was no such thing as living with Capt. Broad, and also from his predecessor Capt. Patty. I said, As to Capt. Patty he might be a little severe; he was remarkably rough in his disposition, but as to Broad, I have known him many years, and looked upon him to be a different sort of a man, however when he comes home he must answer for himself: and as to your wages, it is impossible to settle with you, till I see how you stand on the ship's books. They went away; in two or three days the prisoner and the other man returned again and brought their landlord. They repeated the same demand; I gave them much the same answer, and said it was impossible for me to settle with them till I knew how they upon the ship's books, I was apprehensive they had forfeited their wages, for agreeable to that made, if a sailor does exceed forty-eight hours after a sorting from the other ships before he eaters on board a man of war, he forfeits his wages; they said, they had not forfeited it; they said I would not pay that wages they should. I would accept their power of attorney I said, I would not put them to the and expence; if they would would pay them when the ship returned which they were very thankfull. in particular, said, God bless your honour they took their leaves; I called Commings in, in order to enquire the occasion of our misfortunes by the mortality in the ship; he told me the reason of it was, they had been a long voyage about twelve months upon the coast; that they had contracted disorders, and likewise for want of the doctor, that that brought on distempers. I said, I was very sorry to hear Captain 
               
                  Broad
               


             behaved in that manner; I looked upon him as a different person. Sir, says the prisoner, if I may speak the truth, I never was ill used by captain Broad in my life, nor never saw any thing by him, but what was humane. I asked him, if he was not a d - d rascal, that the last time he was with me, he gave me for the reason of his quitting the ship. The ill usage of captain Broad, he said, Sir, what I said was false; we must say something to make our story good.
Prisoner's Defence.
What I swore in my first examination, I told the truth is true; and the second time of my examination some of captain Broad's friends made me drunk. Here is a gentleman here that arrested Broad for twenty pounds, and offered me and another man money not to appear against Broad; if I had taken the bribe, I should not have brought myself into this hobble. The other evidences that were with me, are at sea, both Howard and Wilson, if they had been examined, it would have proved the charge. I was wade drunk.

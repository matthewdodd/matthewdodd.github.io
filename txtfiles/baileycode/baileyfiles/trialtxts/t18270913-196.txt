            . I am the wife of George Yardley; we live in Church-street, Bethnal-green


. On the 7th of August I went out about eleven o'clock, and left the key in my door - I returned in a quarter of an hour, and found the key had been turned, and my shawl gone off my table - I saw it again at Mr. Blitz's door, on the Friday following - I know it by a darn, which is my own work - I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . The prisoner brought this shawl to me on the 8th of August, and I bought it of her - I had not seen her before; she came to my shop again on the Sunday morning, and I sent for the officer.

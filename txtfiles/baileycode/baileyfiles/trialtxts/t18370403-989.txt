. I am a policeman. On the 9th of March, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the evening, I was in King-street, Hammersmith, about a mile from the prosecutor's—I saw the two pritoners, and stopped them, from information I had received—there was another with them, who made his escape—I searched Davis, who had got his coat buttoned up—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said "Nothing"—I took this shirt from him—took them to the station, and then he said he had picked it up—on the other I found nothing.






MARY RICHARDS
. I live at Kensington. I take in washing—this is a shirt I washed for a servant—it was taken away from the line in the mews where I lire, at the hack of Mr. Phillimore's—f hung it out to dry about two o'clock, and did not miss it till the officer brought it.

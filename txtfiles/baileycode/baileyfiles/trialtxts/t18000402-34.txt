             sworn. - I live in Whitecross-place, Finsbury-square: On the 6th of March, having business at Guildhall


, I was waiting in the lobby, leading to the Council-chamber, and while I was waiting, in conversation, I had pulled off my hat, and put it on a table, which stood in the lobby; by chance, turning my head round, I saw the prisoner at the bar take my hat from off the table, and immediately walked away with it; I followed him, and charged him with having my hat, he seemed much confused, and trembled; I told him, I believed his intention was to steal it; he then dropped my hat, and pulled his own from underneath his coat, where it was buttoned and crumpled up; I then gave him in charge to one of the marshalmen, it was the day of the election for under marshal; I was a candidate, and was waiting for that purpose; I am sure it was my hat.
Prisoner's defence. I went into the place, and laid my hat down upon the table, and happened to take up that gentleman's hat by mistake.

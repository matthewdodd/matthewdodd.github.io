JACQUES LOUIS. On the 22d of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was coming out of Exeter-Change


 - Mr. Cross was with me; I did not feel any thing done, but a witness came and asked if I had lost any thing - I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner and three others go behind Mr. Louis, and the prisoner take the handkerchief from his pocket; I did not know him before, but I had a perfect view of his person; Mr. Louis turned round with a person, named Tyler, and said, "I have lost my handkerchief" - Mr. Tyler seized the prisoner - the other three then disappeared; they had been near enough to have taken the handkerchief from him; it has not been found.
Prisoner. Every word he says is false; the other gentleman took me first, and then he came, and said I was the man.

JOHN WELSH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of June, 1 pair of spectacles and case, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



James Molee, from his person.






JAMES MOLEE
. I am a Greenwich pensioner. On the 7th of Jane I was at the fair, and had my spectacles in my right hand pocket, and lost them—they were safe five minutes before—those now produced are them.





CHARLES THORNTON
. I am a pastry-cook, and live at Greenwich. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take the spectacles out, and run away—I ran after him, and took him as he was offering them for sale to a man—I took them from his hand.

Prisoner. I picked them up; he is taking a false oath.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

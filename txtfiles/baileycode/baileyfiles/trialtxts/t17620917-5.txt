            . I live in Silver-street, Golden-square


. I heard my street door open and shut again; immediately I went and missed the things mentioned in the indictment from out of the parlour. The next morning about six o'clock, the constable of the night brought the two prisoners to my house. Cockran owned she opened the street and parlour-doors, and went in and took the things mentioned the night before; and Adams said, she was standing at a little distance till she came out. The things and they were carried to justice Welch's: There I swore to the Things. The prisoner acknowledged the same there.

            . I am a constable. I was going my rounds, and met with the two prisoners at the Castle and Faulcon in Holborn. They were offering things to sale, which, by the price they asked, gave me reason to conclude they were stolen. I took them into custody. Cockran then owned to me where she had stolen the things, by which means I found out the prosecutor.

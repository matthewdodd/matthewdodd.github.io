WILLIAM LOCK
. I am shopman to William Marchant, of Oxford-street. At a quarter past eleven o'clock on the 6th of December I was in the shop—I turned, and saw the two prisoners run by the window, and presently saw one of them drop the pair of shoes—they were close together—I could not see which dropped them—they are my master's shoes, and had been hanging just at the step of the door—I had seen them safe a quarter of an hour before—I ran after the prisoners—I did not take either of them, but they were taken.

Watts. He said at the station-house that I took them. Witness. No, I did not—I did not say I saw the big boy stoop—I said one of them did.





WILLIAM LOVETT
. I was passing Oxford-street, and saw the two lads—they appeared together, and were talking together—I saw Tyne stop at the prosecutor's shop and take up something—they came towards me, and he dropped the shoes—I said, You d——d young rascal, you have stolen the shoes"—they set off running—I followed them towards St. Giles's, and they were taken before I lost sight of them.





THOMAS CARTER
 (police-constable E 78.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and took the two prisoners.

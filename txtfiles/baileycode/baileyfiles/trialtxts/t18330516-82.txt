             (City police-constable, No. 44). On the afternoon of the 9th of May, I saw the prisoner with another person in Cheapside - I saw a gentleman go into a passage which leads from King-street


 to Ironmonger-lane


 - I saw the prisoner pick his pocket of his handkerchief, and put it into the flap of his trousers - I took the prisoner to the Compter - I don't know the gentleman's name - this is the handkerchief.
Prisoner. You said there were two other persons with me. Witness. Yes, there were, but you picked the pocket - I did not say that I could not swear that you took it, but I would try to give you three months.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing down the court, and saw the handkerchief on the ground: I took it up and put it into my pocket which had a hole in it, and it got into my trousers.

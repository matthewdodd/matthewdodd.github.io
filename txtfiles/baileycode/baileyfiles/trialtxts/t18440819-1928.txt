MESSRS. SHEPHERD
and
AOLPHUS
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN WILLIAM JAMISON
. I am accountant in the Central Bank of Perth, in Scotland. On Saturday, the 10th of Aug., I received from Mr. Burns a letter—this (looking at one) is it—here is some writing on the fly-leaf of it—the letter contained Bank post-bills, bills of exchange, and checks—I compared the bills with the writing on the fly-leaf, to be certain the bills mentioned there were in the letter—I gave the letter with the bills to Mr. Rogers, another clerk, to have them endorsed, and the letter copied—it was returned to me—I then compared the Bank post-bills, bills of exchange, and checks, with the particulars on the fly-leaf, and found they corresponded—I inclosed them in the letter, which I handed to Rogers, to have it posted—it was directed to Messrs. Glynn, Halifax, and Mills, bankers, London—we were apprised in the course of post that it was not received.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You did not make the memorandum on the fly-leaf? A. No, but compared it after the bills were returned to me, before I sent them to the post.

MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The memorandum of what the letter contained was made before you received it? A. I received the Bank post and other bills, to have a note made on the letter, which was done—I compared them with that memorandum before I gave the letter to Rogers to post.





DAVID THOMAS ROGERS
. I am a clerk in this bank, with Jamison. On

the 10th of Aug. he gave me a letter, directed to Glynn and Co.—this is the letter—I copied it, endorsed the bills of exchange, put them in the letter, and handed it to Mr. Jamison again—he inclosed them, and gave the letter to me—I put it into the Post-office.





SIDNEY HAMPDEN WYBROW
. I am a clerk in the General Post-office, the prisoner was employed there. On the 12th of Aug. I received a letter, directed to Messrs. Glynn and Co., in the Edinburgh bag, which arrived about ten minutes to six o'clock—the letters are passed to me by a messenger, who opens the bag, and divides the town and country letters—it then went away to be stamped—it bears the Perth stamp of the 10th of Aug., the Edinburgh of the same day, and the London inland stamp of the 12th.





WILLIAM BLACKBURN
. I am a journeyman plumber, and live in Kings-gate-street, Holborn; I am employed on the water-closets at the Post-office. On the 12th of Aug., in consequence of directions I received, I went near the water-closets, and placed myself in a situation to enable me to see the whole of them, with Peak the officer, at a quarter to six o'clock in the morning—I was in a situation to see four of the water-closets, and if I moved could see the other two—there is a gas-light directly opposite the closets, so that I could see who went in and out—there is no door to the closet—Peak was about ten feet from me—the closets are beneath the letter carrier's office, on the basement, at the end of the kitchen—they are self-acting water-closets—when a person sits on the seat, he fills the box with water above his head, and when he rises, the seat rises an inch, and the water immediately rushes into the basin—there are two gallons in the box, and it leaves one gallon in the basin—when the person rises, it carries down whatever is in the basin—I saw the prisoner enter the closet at ten minutes past six—he was the first person who entered that closet while I was there—I could see distinctly what he did—he tried the closet twice, to see if the water would flow, by sitting down with his clothes buttoned up, and rising up—he then unbuttoned his clothes, and sat down, put his hand into his pocket, and took from it a letter or paper—he then put his bead down to listen, to know if anybody was coming—I then saw checks and Bank-notes in his hand—he commenced examining them, and put some of them underneath him in the closet, with his right hand, into the pan—he then rolled up the letter, or paper, in a round ball, and put that in the pan—I then communicated with Peak, and he ran round and took my place—I took my station again—the prisoner was then examining papers—I directly heard a struggling, then ran round to Peak's assistance, and found him on the prisoner, holding him down on the seat—I put my knee on the seat, to prevent the water flowing into the basin—Peak pulled the prisoner off the seat—I then called for a light, put my arm into the basin, and took out two letters, some bills and checks, and gave them to Peak—the prisoner said, when he rose from the seat, "You cannot hurt me now"—he was taken into custody—they were struggling together in the kitchen.





MATTHEW PEAK
. I am a constable attached to the Post-office. On the morning of the 12th of Aug. I was with Blackburn, about ten paces from him—he came there a little after six o'clock—when he had been a little while looking into the water-closet, he made a communication to me, and I took his position, and saw the prisoner break open a letter with a red seal—he was sitting on the closet—the light was strong enough for me to see the colour of the seal—there was a gas-light seven or eight feet from the prisoner, opposite him—when he broke the seal he took out a square substance, a paper, and put it down by the side of him, either into the pan or under his thigh—it appeared to go into the pan—I ran round to him and seized him—he then

commenced kicking and knocking about—I did not take him off the water-closet, but kept him on the seat, knowing that if he got up the water would flow down, and the contents wash away—he then commenced straggling—Blackburn came round—I saw him put his knee on the seat—I then took the prisoner off the seat—he said, "There, you cannot hurt me now; you only want to injure my character;" and kept striking and knocking at me—I called for Blackburn—I then searched him, and found nothing on him but two fourpenny-pieces, and a sixpence I received from Blackburn—the papers produced are a letter directed to Messrs. Glynn and Co., a Bank post-bill for 15l.; 19s. 10d., and altogether post-bills and securities to the amount of 670/.—he was taken to the solicitor's office, and the letter shown to him—he was told he was charged with stealing and breaking it open that morning—he said he had broken no letter open—he lives at No. 141, Golden-lane, St. Luke's—I had seen him at that lodging on the 22nd of July, and then he said he had no money at all.





WILLIAM LAST
. I am a sub-sorter at the General Post-office. The prisoner was a letter-carrier—it was his duty to collect in the letters of divisions Nos. 11 and 12—No. 10 is near that, on his left side—I observed him, when he was collecting Nos. 11 and 12, very frequently blend the letters of No. 11 with No. 10—I have several times remarked to him that he was a very careless and clumsy fellow—he had done that the very morning this happened—he took No. 12 letters in his right hand, and placed them in his left hand—he should then take No. 11, and place them also, dividing the letters with his fingers, but in doing so he pushed them among the letters of No. 10—I saw him do so that morning, and remarked to him that he was at his conjuring tricks again, was not yesterday sufficient to practise in—he asked what I meant, twice—I told him to mind some morning one of the letters did not stick to his fingers—he said nothing to that—he had nothing to do with No. 10—Messrs. Glynn and Co.'s letters would be sorted to No. 10.





JOHN ROBERTS
. I am a letter-sorter. I was on duty on the 12th of August, and saw the prisoner there—he is my collector—the 10th division is not in his part—on the morning of the 12th I saw him push the letters of No. 11 with those of No. 10, and after he had walked round to divisions 11 and 12, and laid the letters down, he laid his body completely on the 12th division letters, and looked through the wire division of the 12th sorting-table at me, and said, "If I had you down stairs I would curl your hair for you"—he had his body completely over the 12th letters, and would have an opportunity of taking up a letter without my seeing it—this was about five minutes before he was in custody.

MR. JAMESON
re-examined. This Bank post-bill for 18l.; 19s. 10d. was one of those inclosed in the letter.
(William Perry, a plasterer, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY

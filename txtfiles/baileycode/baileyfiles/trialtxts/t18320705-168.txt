             (Police-constable S 144). I was at Somers'-town on the 5th of June, and saw the prisoner put his right hand within his waistcoat - I went and asked what he had got; he said a pair of shoes he brought from home - I said, "Are you sure of that?" he said, Yes; I said, "You must go and prove it" - I took him to the station, and went to his mother's and asked if she had lost a pair of shoes; she said Yes - I asked her to describe them, and she described another pair; I afterwards found the prosecutor.

            . I am brother of William Powell, he is a tailor
 and lives in Houndsditch


. I was in his shop about two o'clock in the afternoon, and, on being alarmed, I saw the prisoner, about ten yards off, running away with this jacket and waistcoat under his arm - I lost sight of him for about two seconds, while he turned the corner, but am certain of his person - he threw the property down before I got up to him - he was secured, and said he had picked it up at the door, but it was hanging within the door post - I saw it safe ten minutes before - he could reach it as he passed.

            . I work for a dyer, and live in Ironmonger-row. I was passing this shop, and saw the prisoner, with two others, one of them snatched the coat and waistcoat from the door, the other two walked on - I cannot say which snatched them, but the prisoner was with them- they were all about his size - I gave an alarm, and then went to the corner of Plough-yard, where I saw Powell bringing the prisoner back with the property.(Property produced and sworn to.)

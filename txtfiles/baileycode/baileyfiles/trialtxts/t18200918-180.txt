            . I am a stationer, and live in Chapel-court, Swallow-street. On the 15th of August, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Hyde-park Corner, a procession was going to Brandenburgh-house, it had passed about a quarter of an hour, when the prisoners with another, ran by me down the road. I knew them, and followed them towards Knightsbridge


; they saw me, and I let them go on, then followed two or three hundred yards, till they came behind a gentleman, followed him some distance, then the third man (not in custody) pulled the handkerchief a little way out of the gentleman's pocket, they still followed him to the Cannon Brewery, then Rowles took it quite out. I went up, they separated on seeing me. Rowles got behind a cart, and put the handkerchief in his coat-pocket. I secured him, took it out, and took him to the gentleman, who refused to attend the office. Malcolm was apprehended that night. I am certain he is the person.
ROWLES'S Defence. I had the handkerchief two days before.

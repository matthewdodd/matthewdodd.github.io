            . I live in Leather Lane





, and am a pork butcher
. The prisoner, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Slaughter 
               



            , was my servant
 about nine weeks. 'Tis usual in our business to pickle up pork for the summer season. I had lost ten pounds worth of pork, without knowing how. I taxed the girl with taking it, and she told me, 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Clark 
               



             had had of her a pound, a pound and a half, or two pounds, at a time, of pork stickings, hogs faces, and other things of mine, which she had taken and given her at several times; and likewise that she had given two other pieces and one sticking to Duncomb, and several other pieces to two others, whom we have not taken. I found upon Clark a linen cloth and a handkerchief, my property. When she heard Slaughter was taken up she absconded, and went to her mother at Battle Bridge. When I took her up she grumbled, and said, Duncomb had had, at several times, more pieces than she had, and confessed she had received pork and other things of Slaughter at several times after I had made my complaint to Mr. Creech.
Q. How many pieces did she confess she had received?
Morris. She said she had a great many.
Q. Did she name that great many by any number?
Morris. She said she had received six pieces or more and a linen handkerchief of Slaughter, and that she told her they were my property; and afterwards told me my handkerchief was lost the next night after she came into New Prison, and she wished the others that had received other pieces were there along with her.
Q. Did you find any thing in the possession of Duncomb ?
Morris. No, I did not.
Q. Did you hear her confess any thing?
Morris. No, my lord.
Q. Did you make Slaughter any promises of favour before she confessed ?
Morris. No, I did not.
Q. Did you threaten before she did?
Morris. No, my lord, I did not.

            . I heard Slaughter say she stole several pieces of pork from Mr. Morris; and I also heard Clark say, that she did receive some pork of her, knowing it to have been stolen.
Q. Did you hear Duncomb confess any thing?
Gardner. No, I did not
William Cramplin. I heard Slaughter say, She has stole pork from her master several times.
Q. Did you ever hear either of the other confess any thing ?
Cramplin. I can't say I have heard them say any thing about it.

            . I went with Mr. Morris to Newgate to see 
               
                  Mary 
                  Slaughter 
               



            ; she there confessed to me that she had taken meat at several times, two or three pounds at a time.
Q. What Meat?
Manwaring. Pickled pork, and said 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Clark 
               



             was one of the receivers of it.
Q. Have you ever heard Clark or Duncomb say any thing about it?
Manwaring. No, I never did.
Rose Sutherland. I know 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Clark 
               



             has often offered pork to sell. I know nothing against Duncomb.

            . I went into 
               
                  Peg 
                  Clark 
               



            's house once, and saw three Stickings of pork.
Q. Did she say which way she came by them?
Whitall. She said her mother-in-law gave her them.
Slaughter's defence.

                  Clark 
               



             sent a woman for some pork, and I gave her some.
Clark's defence.
I never sent a woman in my life for pork; the woman went always of her own accord. I had some, but never sent for any.

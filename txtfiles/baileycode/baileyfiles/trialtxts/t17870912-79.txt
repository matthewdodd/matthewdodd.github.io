The prosecutor deposed that the prisoner was his servant and shopman
 a year and three quarters; on Monday, the 20th of August, the prosecutor and his wife marked ten shillings, and sent a woman, Mrs. Brooks, to buy a piece of cheese; the prosecutor missed some of the money, and sent for a constable; the prisoner fell on his knees, and said he would confess; andhe voluntarily said he was guilty, and he was sorry for it, and that money was the temptation, and in the cellar, by the prisoner's direction, were found eight shillings wrapped up in paper in the saw dust tub, two of which were his wife's marking; he confessed again when the constable came.
Mrs. Brooks and her husband confirmed the above evidence, with respect to the marked money, and purchasing the cheese.
Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.

            . I am a distiller
, and live at Hackney. On the 30th of September, about twelve o'clock at noon, I was in Shoreditch


, and felt my handkerchief taken from my pocket - I turned round, and seized a boy nearly the size of the prisoner - but a gentleman called my attention to the prisoner, who was running away with my handkerchief hanging out of his pocket - I pursued and took him with it - he was never out of my sight - the moment I seized him, he pulled it out of his pocket, and threw it on the pavement - I gave him to the policeman.

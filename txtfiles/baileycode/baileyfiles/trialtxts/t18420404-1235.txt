EMMA JACKSON
 and 




MARY GILL
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
10th of March, I bonnet, value 2s. 9d., the goods of 



Henry Ehn.






EMMA EHN
. I am single, living with my father, Henry Ehn, who keeps a shop in Church-street, Hackney—about one o'clock on the 10th of March, the two prisoners came into our shop, and asked me to show them some bonnets—I showed them some—they would-not suit—they left the shop without buying—soon after a person came in, and told me something—this bonnet produced corresponds with one we lost that day.





CHARLES COLE
. I am an omnibus conductor at Hackney—about one o'clock on Thursday, the 10th of March, as I was cleaning the omnibus, I saw the prisoners come out of Mr. Ehn's shop—Gill had a bonnet under her arm—she went about twelve paces—I went and asked Miss Ehn if she had sold a bonnet—she said "No"—I gave information at the station-house—Gill came out first, and Jackson soon followed—she might not have seen Gill come out.





GEORGE GUY
. I am a policeman. I received information, and found the bonnet on Gill—Jackson was with her—a pot of bear's grease was found on Jackson—it was not opened.

Jackson's Defence. I bought the bear's-grease for 6d.

Gilts Defence. A boy I bought some combs of, gave me the bonnet—the policeman saw him.





GEORGE GUY

re-examined. There were two lads a little distance off.
(Elizabeth Page, stating herself to be a milliner, residing at No. 15, James-street, Lambeth, gave Gill a good character, and engaged to employ her, but, upon inquiry, it was subsequently ascertained that no such person lived there.)

JACKSON—


NOT GUILTY
.

GILL-GUILTY. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.—





Recommended to the Penitentiary.



Fifth Jury, before Edward Bullock, Esq.

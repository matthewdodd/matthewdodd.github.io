1624. 




JOHN JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 pairs of shoes, value 13s., the goods of 



John Yates; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN YATES, JUN
. I live with my father, John Yates, at No. 250, Whitechapel-road. On the 13th of July I saw the prisoner undo a pair of shoes from my father's door—he stood right before me that I should not see—he gave them to two others, who ran away with them—he came back, and undid another pair, and then they all ran away—I called my father—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person, I had seen him with two others, about twenty yards from the shop, before the shoes were moved.





JOHN YATES
. I saw Samuel Elliott holding the prisoner—I missed two pairs of shoes—he said he was going to buy them, but had only got 2s.—they are worth 6s. 6d.

Prisoner's Defence. I never ran away, and never gave any shoes away; I intended to leave a deposit for them.





JOHN YATES

re-examined. They were tied together, and three times wrapped

round a nail—he was three or four yards from the shop when he was stopped—he had not got the shoes—he pot them back when the lad hallooed.





HENRY PADBURY
 (police-constable.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted April, 1846, and confined three months)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. † Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I am a constable; I took the prisoner with some iron, on the 14th of September, about three in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner come up Allhallows-lane; he had something wrapped in his coat very heavy; I followed him, and asked him what he had? he said, two bits of iron; he said it was given to him by the bricklayers, to carry into Rosemary-lane, from Mr. Calvert's brewhouse.

             sworn.
I took the iron down to the brewhouse, and gave it to the bricklayers to be put into the brickwork; it was ten in the morning the 14th of September; this is the iron.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Two of the bricklayers gave me this stuff, and desired me to go and sell it for some beer; I thought it was their property.

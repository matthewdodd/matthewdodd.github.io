            . The prisoner lodged in my house about five months: I missed this linen mentioned in the indictment, on the 16th of August, (mentioning them, with their respective owners); they were left in my care: I found one of the shirts in the prisoner's room: I sent for a constable, and found another on his back: I took him then into custody, and found he had pawned the rest to Mrs. Golding.

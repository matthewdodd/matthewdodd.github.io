Coming up Fish-street-hill


, the 3d of this > month, I lost my handkerchief; I never felt I lost it; it was about four o'clock; Mr. Sutherland came after me with it in his hand.
- SUTHERLAND sworn.
I was walking up Fish-street-hill, and I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and place it in his bosom; I took hold of him immediately with the handkerchief, and he endeavouring to get from me, I tore off part of his waistcoat, and he left it in my hand. He made a stroke at me, but thank God I missed it; and endeavouring to ward off the blow, I knocked him down, and two or three people came up and held him, and I ran after Mr. Wright, and he said it was his handkerchief immediately.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Going up Fish-street-hill, I saw some man throw this handkerchief down, and being in distress I picked it up, and put it into my bosom, and this gentleman catched hold of me by my collar.

CHARLOTTE COOK
.—I am a widow, in partnership with my sister, Margaret Cook—we live at Paddington. At a quarter-past twelve o'clock in the day of the 15th of July, I met Gladhall coming from my coal-cellar with one basket, and saw Stanton going down the garden with the other basket; one contained the piece of carpet, and the other the paper and other articles—they were mine and my sister's—I locked them both in the garden till I called the police, who took them.

Gladhall. I did not mean to take any thing; I saw the door open; I went into the dust-hole, and saw some bits of rag, and took them out.

Witness. I have no dust-hole.

GLADHALL—


GUILTY
.** Aged 13.

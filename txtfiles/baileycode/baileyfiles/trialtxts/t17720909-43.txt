            . I am a coachman
; I was driving a jobb for a man that is ill. I lost a pair of shoe-buckles, a neckcloth, and an handkerchief out of a stable in Cross-key's Mews at Mary-le-bone


; the prisoner passed me whilst I was wiping the coach; I did not mistrust him; after I had done with the coach I went into the stable and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I went immediately and gave notice to the pawnbrokers to stop them if they should be offered to pawn; about half an hour after I had given this notice, a pawnbroker came and informed me he had stopped my buckles. I searched the prisoner, and found my neckcloth and handkerchief in his pocket.

             produced a pair of silver buckles, which he stopped upon the prisoner. (The buckles were deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner in his defence said, he had the things of another boy.

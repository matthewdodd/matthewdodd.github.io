WILLIAM BUTLER (police-constable K 48.) I stopped the prisoner in Back-lane, 25th December, at six o'clock in the morning - he had a bag - I asked what he had there? - he said, a few old rags he had picked up in Wapping - I took it under a lamp, and found these articles, which were wet, and two pieces of carpet over them.

                  Crosby
               



             - we live in Gravel-lane


 - these are my property - I saw them safe at ten o'clock on Christmas-eve in our yard - I know the prisoner has been about the neighbourhood, and I believe he has no one to protect him; but he had no right to this property.

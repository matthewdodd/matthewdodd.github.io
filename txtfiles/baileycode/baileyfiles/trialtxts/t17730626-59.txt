            . Standing at my own door the 19th of May, I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Mr. Nicholson's pocket; I ran from my own door and detected him with it in his hand; as soon as I laid hold of him he dropt it; I gave it to Mr. Nicholson. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

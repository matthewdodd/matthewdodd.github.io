            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, I saw the prisoner in Whitecross-street, with a sack on his shoulder: I felt the sack, I found there was lead in it; I said to him, you have got a pigeon here. I took him to the watchhouse and the lead.
Prosecutor. This is my lead, I know it by the substance and size; it matches with the other pieces; I am sure it is my lead; it was taken from Islington Chapel.
Prisoner's Defence. I was hired to carry this lead; the man that hired me I have not seen since.

I am a publican
; I live at Deptford. I lost my money on Tuesday the 11th of April; I was going to Deptford


 about ten in the evening on foot alone; and the prisoner Hebert accosted me, and asked me if I would treat her with a glass of gin, and I proceeded on; she still asked me; I said, can you drink gin; she said, yes; this was at the end of Rosemary-lane; I was then going home, and she asked me if I would go home with her; she said it was but just by; I said, I cannot stay; she said, do, go home with me; and I being a little prevailed upon, went with her.
Was she alone? - Yes; I went with her, I do not know the house, and after coming into the room, she asked me what I meant to give her to drink; I said I did not know; I wanted to go away again, seeing the situation of the place; I gave her sixpence; there was a door that came from another room into that; 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



             came into that room, and persuaded me to go into the room to her, and said I might come in that way; when I came in, the other followed me, and she asked me to send for a pot of porter; I said I had no change, only a guinea; I did not chuse to trust them with a guinea, but if they would bring change for a guinea, I would pay for a pot of porter; they could not get change for a guinea; in the mean time, while another girl was gone for a pot of porter, 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



             partly undressed herself; she persuaded me to sit on the bed; I would not, I sat on the chair, and she began to unbutton my breeches in a most scandalous manner. I then said, I will go and get the porter myself; after that I got out of the house, and found myself clear of the place I ran as fast as I could, and took water; I said to the waterman, I fancy I shall want change for a guinea; I felt in my pocket and found my money was gone; I desired the waterman to put on shore, and make his boat fast, and I took him with me and went to the place; I told two watchmen of it; I went with the officer of the watch, and the beadle; I went into two or three different streets, till I found out the house, and I found the two prisoners and another woman and a man, the man and woman were in bed; the officer asked me if they were the people; I said yes; I told him they were the people; the prisoner Dykes said she never saw me in her life before; he told her I had been robbed, and they had the money; she still said she never saw me before; I desired the officer to search them; accordingly the officer searched 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



            , he found sixpence in her apron-string; they heard the jingle of money, by which reason they immediately searched her all over; they could not find any money for a considerable time; afterwards, he said we should all go to the watch-house, he insisted upon it; and accordingly following 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



            , she began to swear and storm about it; they got her into a passage, and she pretended to be in a kind of fit, and they put her into the room again, and they found a guinea; then they began to dispute about it, and a man and a woman that were in bed were desired to get up, and I pulled up the head of the bedstead, and saw two guineas and a half lay; I gave that to the officer; after that they insisted on searching further, and 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



             began to storm and swear; and the watchman found another guinea just where he stood; then they were all taken to prison; we found no more money; and the next morning there was a hearing before the Magistrate, and he asked 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



             if she concealed any part of that money, and she said, no; there was some silver that was taken away from 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Hebert
               



            , I only just asked her if she claimed that, she said, yes; seven shillings she had from a gentleman in a coach, and five shillings of it was her's; I believe the silver was found in Hebert's pocket; I was desired to appear the Saturday following; this was the Tuesday, when I came to the watch-house; the next Saturday I saw the beadle.
Was you in liquor? - I cannot say I was sober; I was not very much in liquor.
Was there any light in the room where you was the first time? - When we first went in, the girl called for a candle in the entry, and a candle was brought; I am quite sure these were the women; I can only say I lost six guineas; it was loose in my right-hand breeches-pocket.

             sworn.
On the 11th of April, I was officer of the night, and the prosecutor came to me between twelve and one in the morning, and informed me he had been robbed of six guineas; I asked him, by whom? he said by two women of the town; he said he knew the women, but did not immediately know the street: he went up different streets, and at last found the house; he said he was sure that was the house; there was a light in it, and the shutters were cracked, and we saw through, and within the room I saw two or three persons; I heard them disputing about money; the words were very high, and I believe I could safely say I heard 
               
                  Mary
                   Dykes
               



            's. voice in particular; he said they were the girls, and that was the house. I knocked twice; somebody came, and asked what I wanted; I said, I must see Nancy; the prosecutor said her name was Polly; I then said, I want Polly; they said, what Polly? I said, the girl that I sleep with sometimes, in order to obtain admission into the house; then the prisoner Dykes opened the door, and the prosecutor said he was sure she was the woman that robbed him of his money; I took charge of her; she denied it; she wanted to go to the window; I said she should not; I searched her, and in shaking her clothes, I heard the sound of money, and from the found, I am pretty clear it was gold; I found nothing in her pockets; I insisted on her pulling off her clothes; she hesitated; I put down my hand, and found sixpence in the tail of her petticoat.

I picked up the last guinea; she acknowledged to me that the five shillings and the half-guinea were the change of the other guinea.
PRISONER DYKES'S DEFENCE.
I lent my hat to the woman of the house; I came at ten for it, and she desired me to go in, and the gentleman asked me to get a pot of porter; he went for the pot of beer himself at ten, and never returned till almost two.

PRISONER HEBERT'S DEFENCE.
I was going down Queen-street; the prosecutor stopped me, and asked me to have something to drink; I declined it at first, and I went to the Queen's Head; he asked me to see me home; he came home with me; he sent out for sixpenny-worth of liquor; after that the gentleman wanted me to oblige him for so small a trifle as sixpence, which I did not chuse, and he was going away; as the gentleman was going away,

             came in; the gentleman asked her to drink some porter; the gentleman desired the woman of the house to get change for a guinea, he would not trust her with the change; he got up, and put his hand in his right-hand breeches-pocket, and said he would go himself and get change; he went out, and never returned till he returned with an officer.

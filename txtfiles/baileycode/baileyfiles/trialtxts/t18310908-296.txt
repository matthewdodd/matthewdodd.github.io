WILLIAM BARBER. I live at Chelsea. I was in a public-house in the Haymarket, about two o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 27th of June, and went to Whitcombe-street


 with the prisoner, whom I was talking to for some time; she wished me to go home with her - I refused- she turned round, and said, "Here comes the Policeman;" I turned to look at him, and she ran away - I immediately missed my watch; I followed, and lost sight of her, but saw her in custody the same day.

            . I am a Policeman. On the 27th of June, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Parliament-street with a soldier, who was having words with her; she had some thing in her hand - the soldier said, "You have something there, I will give you in charge;" I walked over, and saw her put her hand to her bosom - she turned a corner, and began to run; I followed her, and put my hand on her shoulder - she then took this watch from her bosom, and threw it away; I asked what it was - she said she had no watch; I took it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went to a public-house with him; he was intoxicated - he went to a room with me, and gave me the watch to keep till Monday; we then came out, and he said I had robbed him.

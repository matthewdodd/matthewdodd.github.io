            . I am a surgeon
, and live in Finsbury-terrace. On the 11th of November, aboutten o'clock, I was walking up Chiswell-street towards Finsbury-square


; I thought something went from my pocket; I missed my handkerchief, turned and seized the prisoner, and accused him of stealing it - I took his hat off, but it was not there; a woman begged me to let him go, and pointed to my handkerchief, which was about two feet from where I took him; I called the officer and gave him in charge; this is the handkerchief - there was a woman in front of me, but no one behind me; it was not possible it could have dropped from me.
Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. Was this about ten o'clock at night? A. A few minutes after ten o'clock; there were plenty of persons about before and behind me when I missed my handkerchief; the woman was not behind me, she was in front of me; when I turned there was no one but the prisoner behind me for several yards - I either said I felt something go from my pocket, or that I felt my pocket lighter, I cannot tell which; I did not feel my pocket touched - the prisoner made no resistance; I found a handkerchief in his hat, but not mine - the magistrate said I should have secured the woman, but she could not have taken the handkerchief.

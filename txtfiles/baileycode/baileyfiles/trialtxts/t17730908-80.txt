            : the prisoner worked with me a considerable time.

Upon missing these things, and suspecting the prisoner, I went to search at the pawnbroker's; the cloak and the nankeen breeches I found at Mr. Mackaway's in Shoreditch, and the other breeches and the furtout coat at Mrs. Montell's, and a pair of fustian breeches.

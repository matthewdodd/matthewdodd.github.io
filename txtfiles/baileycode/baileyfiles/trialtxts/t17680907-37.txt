             and I are partners. On Wednesday the 3d of August, between five and six in the afternoon, Mr. Nichols knocked at my door, and told me a man was stealing a green baize cloth from the chariot, and was gone down Long-acre; I ran, we took the prisoner in Castle-street; and when we were before the magistrate, the cover was brought there by 
               
                  Richard 
                  Lindey 
               



            , and I swore to it.

                  Nicholls 
               



            . On the 3d of August, between five and six in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, and take a green cover from off a chariot and put it under his arm, and come out with it and go down Long-acre; I knocked at the door and told Mr. Berry what I had seen; we ran and got sight of the man, which was the prisoner; when we got to Hanover-street I said, that is the man; the prisoner immediately said, I have stole nothing; we took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , while we were there the cloth was brought in.

                  Saunders 
               



            . I work for the prosecutor, betwixt the hours of five and six that day, I was coming out of the work-shop for a pint of beer, I saw the prisoner stand by the chariot; when he saw me he made off out of the shop, he had not the cover at that time.

                  Lindey 
               



            . I found the cover concealed under a carriage in a gateway in Hanover-street; I carried it to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, the prosecutor owned it (produced in court.)
Mr. Berry. This is a new cover, so was ours; here is a string broke, which makes it appear it was torn from the carriage.
Prisoner's defence.
I was never in the shop, and no goods were found upon me; I am a seafaring man.

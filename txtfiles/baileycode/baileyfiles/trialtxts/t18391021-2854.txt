 was indicted

for stealing, on the

CHARLES HAWKINS
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Tottenham-court-road. About six o'clock in the evening of the 28th of September, I was speaking to a person in my shop, and a female called me to the door in great haste, and told me something—I saw the prisoner going down Store-street—I went after her and said, "What have you got?"—she said, "Nothing at all"—I opened her apron and found this print—she said a woman had given it her, and was to meet her at the bottom of Store-street—I took her back and gave her in charge—this print had been on the threshold of my door with a pile of others—she had not been in the shop.





FRANCIS FRYER
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner.





WILLIAM PARSONS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction from Mr. Clark's office—she is the person—(read.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Tottenham-court-road, and a person asked me to hold a piece of print—I did not know it was stolen—the witness came and asked what I had in my apron—I said, "I did not know"—I never was inside this place before.

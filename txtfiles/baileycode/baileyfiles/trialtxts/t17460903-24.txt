John Egelston. Please you, my Lord, she came this Day se'nnight to my Master's Shop, Mr. Stratford; she came for a Quarter of a Pound of Plumbs, and whilst I was serving of her, she took these Scales from off the Compter.
Q. Did you see her take them?
Stratford. I did not see her; I stopt her, and said I believe you have something more than your own; she deny'd it at the first, and made very little Defence, but took them from under her Apron, and gave them to me.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What have you to say in your Defence?
Prisoner. Please your Lordship, I went into the Shop to buy some Plumbs; while he was serving me I took up the Scales to look upon them, and laid them down again, not with any Design to steal them.



               Guilty

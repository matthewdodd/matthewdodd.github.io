            . I live in Old Gravel-lane, Ratcliff-highway


; I lost the things mentioned in the dictment (mentioning them) between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of March. On the Monday morning, I was searching about among the pawnbrokers, and at Mrs. Alford's I found my sattin cardinal and laced handkerchief; I found my gown was sold to one Mr. Bourn, in Bow-street; the red cloak in pawn to Mr. Allen, in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane. When the prisoner was taken up, she owned she came into my house, and hoped I would be merciful to her; she did not own she took any thing out. I never saw her before.


                  Anne 
                  Eades 
               



            . On Easter-eve, the prisoner asked me to carry the cardinal to pawn for half a crown, which I did, and gave her the money: and about half an hour after she desired me to carry the handkerchief, which I did, for 2 s. and gave her the money.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Alford 
               



            . The cardinal and handkerchief were pledged to me by 
               
                  Anne 
                  Eades 
               



            ; (produced and deposed to.)

                  Harvey 
               



            . I am an officer; I had the prisoner in charge; at first she denied taking the things: I found Bennet carried some of the things for the prisoner; I could not find her till this morning: she is here.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Bennet 
               



            . The prisoner was destitute of a lodging; I let her lie with me; she brought the gown to me, and said it was her first husband's, and desired I would make the most of it I could: so I sold it to Mr. Bourn, for half a guinea. I gave the prisoner 2 half-crowns, and, being in distress, I used the rest. I carried the red cloak for her to Mr. Allen, a pawnbroker. She was always seizing me to death to fetch and carry things for her.
Prisoner's defence.
I was cleaning my room on my knees with my scrubbing-brush; Bennet wanted me to pawn a black cardinal; I said I would not, for if my Jack came home he would lick me; she desired me to pawn a cloak and handkerchief: then I called 
               
                  Anne 
                  Eades 
               



            , and sent her with them. I leave it to the mercy of the court.
Q. to Eades. Was Bennet by when the prisoner sent you with any of the things.
Eades. No, she was not.

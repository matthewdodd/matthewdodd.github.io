            . I live at Bethnal-green


. On the 23d of August I took the prisoner home, and gave him some victuals, he stopped from ten o'clock in the morning till twelve. I told him I had a coat to sell, if he knew any body who wanted it, he asked to see it; he pulled off his own coat, threw it down, and went out with my coat on his back, he remained out about five minutes. He asked how much I wanted for it; I said 2 l. 5 s. my wife said, nobody should have it under 50 s. He then ran out and through the passage of a public-house. I lost sight of him. He had put it on over his own, and ran off with both. I have not found it.

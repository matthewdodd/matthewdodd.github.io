            ) What do you know of this Matter charg'd on the Prisoner at the Bar? Did you let him the Lodgings? You say you charge him with these Goods; what do you say in order to charge him?


                  Mary 
                  Gilson 
               



            . He robb'd me.
Q. How do you prove he robb'd you? When did you let the Lodgings to him?

                  Gilson 
               



            . About four Months ago.

                  Gilson 
               



            . About a Fortnight ago .

                  Mary 
                  Gilson 
               



            . Yes, my Lord, then I ask'd him for the Keys, when he made me distrust he had robb'd his Lodgings .
Q. Who did he pawn them to?


                  Mary 
                  Gilson 
               



            . I don't know the People's Name, or the Place; but he carried me to the People where he had pawn'd them. First I found the Looking Glass, then the Sheets; the Blanket or Pillow I have not found, nor could I find, nor the Brass Candlestick.
Q. Then you found nothing but the Looking Glass and Pair of Sheets? [The Curtains, Glass and Sheets were produced in Court.] Have you any Thing farther to say against this Man ?


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) Will you ask the Witness any Questions ? She says, you own'd you had robb'd your Lodgings, and you carried her to the Place, and confessed the taking of these Things.
Prisoner. I took these Things out of meer Necessity, out of no Design to wrong her. I had not discharg'd the Room, nor given the Key up.

             . I am Constable. The Warrant was brought to the Prisoner's Wife. I took her up, but I could do nothing with her. The Prisoner took these Things, and pawn'd them in Broad St. Giles's Parish . He went the Day before I took him up, took the People to buy out the Glass, Curtain and Sheet, after he knew the Warrant was out against him: His Wife told us so .
Q. Did he own to you he took the Goods and pawn'd them at the Pawnbrokers? and that he got the People to fetch them out ?
Pulling. Yes .


                  Q.

J. Wylde. I am watchman to Mr.


                  Alex 
                  Cluney 
               



            , upon Smart's-key and Dice-key; I had a lighter of sugar that belongs to him at Smart's-key


; I went to see if all was safe, and found the prisoner under the tarpaulin, on the 3d of this instant, about four in the morning, and I found two bags filled with sugar under the tarpaulin also; after I had secured him, I found one of the hogsheads was broke open, and above a hundred weight of sugar taken out.
Q. Did you know the prisoner?
Wylde. I never saw him in my life before.
Prisoner's defence.
I had been to see a brother who was a Barking fisherman; there came three young men and desired me to go with them for a bag of sugar; I had not been there above a minute before the man came; then they desired me to get under the tarpaulin.

THOMAS JAMES PAINTER
. I am assistant to Henry Perrin, of Holborn-bill. On the 14th of January I saw the prisoner, after lurking about a quarter of an hour, drag this Macintosh down, it tore the button-hole out—heran down Leather-lane, I followed him, and he threw it down—I took it up, followed, and took him in Charles-street—I lost sight of him when he turned the corner, but I am sure he is the boy.

Prisoner. I was trying to stop the boy that took it. Witness. I am sure he is the person—I saw him throw it away.




GUILTY
. Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Parkhurst.

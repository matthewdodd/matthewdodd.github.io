Gent.
 at West Ham in Essex


, on the 6th of September
 last, of a Silver Cup value 5 l. 4 Spoons value 40 s.
             The Cup was found upon them but the Spoons (Braseby confest before the Justice) were melted down. The Prisoners were Persons that did belong to the Poppet Shews in Bartholomew Fair

: The Woman was taken in More fields, hid under a Bench, and the Boy was taken in Bartholomew Fair. They had nothing material to offer, having been old Offenders; yet the Evidence did not affect the Boy so much as the Woman, so he was 

               acquitted
            , but she was found 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

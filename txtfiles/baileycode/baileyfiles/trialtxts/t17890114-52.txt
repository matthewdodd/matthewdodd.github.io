                   GRIMES
               



             sworn.
I am a waterman and lighterman. On the 7th of January, I went into a booth on the ice, about twenty-five yards from the ship Themis


; there was Freeman and the two prisoners, and a man that made his escape. I went out of the booth, and returned back afterwards, and saw the two prisoners take two bars, one after another, out of the barge; they carried them to another barge that lie near the shore, and then they came back again, and sat and drank in the booth; they said they had spent seven shillings in the booth, and that they would have forty-seven shillings by the morning; I staid, till three or four in the morning. I heard one of them say,they are safe enough, take care of the pop, don't let that go off; I went into a boat, and kept a watch, and I heard the prisoner, Rutledge say, Yeo-ho! I heard a bar drop; I pursued after them. Rutledge had one bar, and the other another; Freeman was there a part of the time. I secured two bars that were on the wharf, and the other bar was taken on the ground, by a young fellow.
- FREEMAN sworn.
The bars were taken, at night between twelve and one, out of the lighter. I was on the deck of the ship; it was my watch-night. I am sure the two prisoners were both concerned, and another man. I saw them take the bars out of our barge, and put them in a west country barge.

             sworn.
I have examined the bars. I am sure the property belongs to

            , Esq
.
Jury. Might not another ship bring some iron of the same mark? - Yes. There were eight missing out of the lighter.
PRISONER BUTLER's DEFENCE.
Rutledge and Freeman asked me to go to the booth. I was very much in liquor, and Freeman asked me to get him some bars out, which I refused.
The prisoner, Butler, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

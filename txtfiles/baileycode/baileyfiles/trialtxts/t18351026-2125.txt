THOMAS GREEN
. I live at Tottenham, and have an office in Furnival's-inn. On the 6th of October, about one o'clock in the day, I was in Shoe-lane, and went to call on friend—a person came in, in two minutes, and asked if I had lost my handkerchief—I put my hand into my pockets, and missed it—it was produced to me in about two minutes—I had felt it safe about ten minutes before.





WILLIAM DEVEY

Prisoner. There were a great many persons about at the time—the streets were all up, and nobody could pass—the handkerchief was not in my hat. Witness. I saw it there.





JOHN HUCKEL
. I am a constable. I saw Mr. Devey stop the prisoner—he struggled greatly, and his hat fell off with the handkerchief in it—I took possession of it—several labourers about the place seemed inclined to rescue him.
(Propertly produced and sworn to.)

THOMAS TIPPER (Police-constable T 152). On the 15th of May I was in the parish of St. Dunstan, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner near St. Dunstan's church, with two others - they went behind a gentleman; the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and drew out a handkerchief - the gentleman went on; he was not aware of it; I secured the prisoner, and he dropped the handkerchief from under his coat - a gentleman took it up, and gave it me; I went after the gentleman who had lost it, and informed him of it - he said it was his handkerchief; I told him to come to the Compter - he said he would attend next morning, but I did not see him again - the persons who were with the prisoner were behind him to conceal him, and I had seen them in conversation with him.

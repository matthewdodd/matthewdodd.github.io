JAREMIAH SPILLER. I am a mahogany-polisher
, and live in Carnaby-market. On the 23rd of January I was locked out of my lodging, and went to look for one; I saw a great many people at the door of the Crown public-house, Pulteney-street


 - I asked for a lodging there; I was returning home; a man in a flannel jacket ran against me, and as he passed me he took off my hat - I was running after him, and another man knocked me down; I should know him again - I went and saw a Policeman.

            . I am a Policeman. I was going on duty at half-past six o'clock on Sunday morning, and saw about twenty-five people about the Crown, making a disturbance - I went up to them, and saw the prisoner with this hat just stuck on his head; it did not seem to fit - I took it off, and asked where he got it; he said, "What is that to you?" I asked the maker's name, and the colour of the lining; he said he could not tell - I was taking him to the station; he ran away - another Policeman took him; he was dressed in a flannel jacket.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had been all night at a wake - a man came and asked me to buy a hat; I gave him 4s. for it.

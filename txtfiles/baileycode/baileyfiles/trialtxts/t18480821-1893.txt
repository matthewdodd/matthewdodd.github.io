JANE FISH

. On 26th I took the prisoner's clothes from him in gaol—he said he had concealed a sovereign in the back of his coat—I said I had not seen it—he said he would rather lose it than say anything about it—I searched his coat and found it—a new suit of clothes were taken off him which his mother knew nothing of.

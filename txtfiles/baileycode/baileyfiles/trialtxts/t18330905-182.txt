WILLIAM WELSH. I am nephew of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Welsh
               



            . I lost the duplicate of a watch in April last - it had been pawned for 10s. at Mr. Griffiths.

            . I produce the duplicate to prove that this watch was pawned; and it was redeemed, to the best of my belief, by the prisoner - when he was taken this watch was found on him.

            . I took the prisoner on the other charges - I found this watch on him; he was very desirous for the magistrate to allow him to have the watch again, but he would not - the prosecutor then claimed it; he described it to me before he saw it.
WILLIAM WALSH. This is my watch - the prisoner lodged with me in the month of March.
Prisoner. Q. Was your box broken open? A. No; but the duplicate was in it, and it was taken out.

Q. Where did you come from? - Out of Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. She asked me if I did not wash for Mr. Dillon? I told her, yes; and she said, she came from Mr. Dillon's cook, and she desired her to send me back directly.
Q. What was you to send back? - To go back myself to Mr. Dillon's cook. I told her I was going a little further, after another young lady's linen. She told me to make haste, and she would stop at the corner of Titchfield-street; and I went after this Miss Roberts's linen.
Q. You left her there? - Yes, I did.
Q. You found her there in the same place when you came back? - Yes, in the same place where she said she would stop. She told me, I had better not stop any longer, for she could carry home the linen as well as me. I asked her what was the master? She said, she did not know what was the matter. I delivered the bundles to the prisoner, one under one arm, and one under the other.
Q. You delivered both of them? - Yes, both of them, and I returned back to Mr. Dillon's again.
Q. And what became of the prisoner? - She went up Portland-street, to take the bundles home. She was by when I met the man, and she said then, when I said I lived at Mrs. Roberts's, it was No. 109, Great Portland-street.
Q. You went to Mr. Dillon's? - Yes, and when I came there, I asked if they had sent for me? They said, no. The servant asked what was the matter? I did not make any further answer, but went out of doors, and went home, to see if the woman had brought the linen home, and there had nobody been.
Q. Did you ever see any of your property since? - No further than I employed a constable to search the pawnbrokers, but they could not find any thing.
Q. Has any part ever been found at all? - No, there has not.
Q.How did you get at the prisoneragain? - She was taking a bundle from a little boy in Oxford-road; a person sent for me that heard of it, and I was sent for to the watch-house in Mary-le-bone-lane, to see if I knew her.
Q. How soon after? - It was about four o'clock when I went, and they said she was taken up about one, the next day but one. Wednesday.
Q. When you came there, did you see any bundles belonging to you? - No, nothing at all.
Q. Are you sure that is the same woman that took the property belonging to you? - Yes, I am certain of it.
Mr. Knowlys. Where was it you first see the person that afterwards got your bundle? - Between Ogle-street and Titchfield-street. I was going to this young lady's for her bundle.

Q. You never see this person before in your life? - No.
Q. You say, she had told you a story, that you was desired to go to Mr. Dillon's; that something amiss had happened? - Yes.
Q. You inquired of Mr. Dillon's whether they sent for you? - Yes.
Q. Did not you tell them at Mr. Dillon's what a strange fool they had made of you? - I did not say any thing further; but I was frightened; I was afraid the woman had robbed me then.
Q. This is just by Portland-street where you parted with the two bundles? - Not far.
Q. Hardly a hundred yards from your house, is it? - Rather better than that.
Q. It would not take you above three minutes to go from there to your own house? - No, I could not walk it in less than five minutes.
Q. She went towards your home? - She did.
Q. When you got to Miss Roberts's, was not she extremely angry? - She was.
Q. Did not she threaten to take you up? - She did.
Q. Did not she tell you that you must find them out? - She did.
Q. I take it, you was a good deal frightened, and thought you would come to harm on the occasion? - Yes, I did; I did not think I should come to any further hurt than my friends must pay for the things.
Q. You have never been able to find any thing? - No.
Q. Nor you did not see the person to whom you imagined you delivered them till three or four days after? - Not till the Wednesday.

1816. 




DAVID KELLY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



William Tabor, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







WILLIAM TABOR
. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Fenehurch-street. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 18th of June I was in Lombard-street—I missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw a person near me, and the prisoner a little behind him—I said nothing—I allowed the person near me to walk away, and kept my eye on the prisoner—he passed me, and looked into a perfumer's shop—he seemed not to know whether to run or what to do—a person came up and looked in at the same window—he asked that person where Abchurch-lane was—he said, "This way"—he then ran—I followed him—he looked at several doors in Abchurch-lane—I kept pretty near to him, and when at the bottom of Abchurch-lane, near King William-street, I saw a policeman—I then taxed the prisoner with having my handkerchief—he immediately produced it, either from his waistcoat or coat, and said, "Why did you not say it was yours when you saw me pick it up?"—I had not dropped it that I am aware of—I am sure the handkerchief he produced was mine—this now produced is it.





DAVID WILLIAM BARTHOLOMEW FORD
 (City police-constable. No. 422.) I took the prisoner into custody—he took from his waistcoat this handkerchief—I afterwards found two others—one was round his neck, but it is a pocket-handkerchief—they have no marks on them—they did not appear to have been long in his possession, as they smelt of perfume.

Prisoner's Defence. I took the handkerchief off the ground, and gave it to the gentleman directly he asked me for it.





JOHN HUTCHINSON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the same person.

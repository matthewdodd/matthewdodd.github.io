            . On the 21st of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop for some calico. While the boy was reaching it she went out. He said she has taken a piece of print. I followed her. As she crossed the street I saw her let it fall. I gave her in charge. A pair of stockings were found on her.

JOSEPH MARTINI
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of December, 1 tobacco-box, value 8d., the goods of 



William Patterson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM PATTERSON
. I keep a tobacconist's shop in Hand-court, Holborn. About eight o'clock, on the 15th of December, from information I received, I went and found the prisoner at the window—I supposed him to be amusing himself with a straw he had in his hand—he was looking at the boxes—in a few minutes he left, and passed me as I stood at the side-door—I did not suspect he had robbed me—I went to the window to see what could have attracted his attention, and to my surprise I found a space of about six boxes vacant, they had been taken through an aperture which had been made accidentally—I went after him, but could not see him—I came back and went into my sitting-room—about half an hour after, I heard some boys cry out, "You Bob, with your hand in the gentleman's fob"—I went out, walked up the court, and saw the prisoner with four others—they then parted towards Red Lion-street, and from thence to Holborn—I met a policeman and told him, he took the prisoner—he told me the prisoner threw a box down, and I took it up—in going along he exclaimed he had thrown something out of his pocket—a light was got, and a china bowl was taken up, which was broken—this box and this bowl are mine, they were taken out of my window.





JOHN FRIER
 (police-constable E 116.) I took the prisoner—I saw him throw down this snuff-box, and heard this bowl fall.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down—I saw this snuff-box on the ground—I was going home, and the policeman took me.





EDWIN BENNETT
 (police-constable E 94.) produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

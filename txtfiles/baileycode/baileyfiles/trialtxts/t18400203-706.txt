WILLIAM ELDRIDGE
 was indicted

 for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



Charles Smith and another, on the 
30th of January, and stealing therein 1 piece of handkerchiefs, value 1l. 15s. and 9 other handkerchiefs, value 2l. 5s., their property.






GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
. I am a policeman. On Thursday, the 30th of January, about five minutes to six o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another, twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor—they turned up Southampton-street, and spoke to a third—the one that was with him pulled something from under his coat, and gave to the prisoner, who put it into his cap—I made towards them, and all three ran away—I pursued the prisoner—he ran down Silver-street—I ran and got in front of him, and he said, "Which is the way to Charing-cross?"—I said, "What

have you got here?" taking hold of his cap—he stooped underneath my arm and ran away—Etheridge stopped him—we took him to the station-house, and found this piece of handkerchiefs between his trowsers and shirt—Etheridge found another piece—the prisoner said the other man had thrown them down, and he picked them up—and while he was being searched he said he took them.





RICHARD ETHERIDGE
. I am a policeman. I was in company with Restieaux—I saw no more than he has stated—I found another piece of handkerchief on the prisoner, concealed between his trowsers and bit waist-coat.





WALTER VALENTINE YEMAN
. I am in the employ of Charles Smith and another—these pieces of handkerchief are their property—they were safe in the window half an hour before the officer gave us information that they were at the station-house—I found the window broken, and the goods gone—we lost three pieces.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that there was no proof of breaking and entering, and that he was hired to carry the property by two men.)




GUILTY of stealing only.  Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

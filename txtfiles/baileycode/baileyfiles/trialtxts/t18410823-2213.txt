 for stealing, on the 
13th of August, 1 plane, value 4s.; 1 square, value 2s.; and 1 auger, value 1s.; the goods of

GEORGE COCK
. I am a carpenter, and live at Putney. On Friday, the 13th of August, I was at work on the top of a building at Putney—I went to dinner at twelve o'clock, leaving some tools on the building—I missed them about a quarter after one, when I came back—they were worth 7s.—these are them—(produced.)





WILLIAM PARKER
 (police-constable T 47.) I was on duty at Chiswick on the 13th of August. I stopped the prisoner in Devonshire-row, with one plane, one square, and an auger—I asked where he got them—he said they were his own property, he had brought them from his own home; that he took them to Hammersmith to pawn, but they refused to take them—I stopped him five miles from Cock's premises, at a quarter to seven o'clock, the same night as the robberying






JOHN JONES
 (police-constable T 31.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Clerkenwell Sessions—(read)—he is the person—I have known him eleven years.




GUILTY
.* Aged 53.—


Transported for Ten Years.

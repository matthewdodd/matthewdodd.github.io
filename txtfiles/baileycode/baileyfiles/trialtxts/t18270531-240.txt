GEORGE COLLIER. The prisoner was in my employ. I am a bookbinder

            . I keep a sale-shop. On the 17th of May a man called and asked if I would buy some Bibles. I said Yes; and on the 18th the prisoner brought two, for which he asked 3s., and asked if I could take seven a week of him - this created some suspicion. I told him to leave them, and come back - I kept the Bibles; he did not return.

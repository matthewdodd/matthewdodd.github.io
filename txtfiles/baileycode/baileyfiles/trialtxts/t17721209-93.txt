            . I live in Houndsditch Liberty. As I was coming through Gravel-lane


, on the 10th of October, I met three women and a man; they collared me, and carried me by force into a house; the three women flung me down; they got upon me, and almost stifled me, and then took from me the things mentioned in the indictment. I am certain the prisoner is one; she took my knee buckles; I have seen her several times; she lives in Gravel-lane.
The prisoner in her defence called one witnesses, who said the prosecutor had offered to compromise the matter, and another witness, who said that the prosecutor went into the room of another person, and insisted that was the room he was robbed in.

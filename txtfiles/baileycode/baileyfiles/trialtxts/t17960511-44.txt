             sworn.
I was servant, on Friday the 29th of April, to Mr. and Mrs. Barrow, in Store-street, Bedford-square


; I let the prisoner in that day, I had seen him twice before, my master knew him, and had known his mother for many years.
Q. His mother had been an attendant in the family? - A. Yes; he asked for my mistress, she was in the back parlour.
Q. How lately before he came in had you seen the two watches? - A. I had left the parlour upon his knocking at the door to go to open it; they were hung over the mantle-piece in the fore parlour; the parlour-door is a little way in the passage, on the right-hand side, upon the same floor; I went to the back parlour and told her George Deadman wanted her, I did not stop with my mistress half a moment; when I came from my mistress, I met him near the fore parlour door, with his right-hand to his waistcoat-pocket, and his hat in his left-hand, I had left him in the passage close by the parlour door; I told him my mistress was coming, and he said he must speak to a man first; he went off, and opened the street-door, and pulled it to, but did not shut it; I went into the parlour a little behind my mistress, who was going into the fore parlour, I asked my mistress where the captain's gold watch was.
Q. How long after he was gone, was it before you perceived the watches were missing? - A. Not a minute.
Q. When you let him in did you shut the street door after him? - A. I shut the street-door after him; upon missing the watches I opened the door and he was got out of sight; I gave the alarm, andpursued him till I came into Francis-street, and I could not get any intelligence of which way he went; I got sight of him in Oxford street, opposite St. George's Market, and he turned into his lodgings in some court opposite St. George's Market; he did not see my his sister was with me, and she went to Mary-le bonne Watch-house and got a constable for me, his name is Macklin; Macklin, and his sister, went to his lodging, and I staid at the corner of the court, in Oxford-street, till he came out of the court; and I took him by the left arm, and a man of the name of Oliver collared him, but he got away, and Oliver took him again; he hit Oliver two or three times, and got away from him; I pursued him till he was in the watch-house.
Q. Was he secured that day? - A. Yes; that was about a quarter after four in the afternoon; it was about half past one that he came to our house; he was taken the corner of James-street, in Oxford-street; there was nothing found upon him.

             sworn.
I am the beadle and constable of Mary-le-bonne parish; I was applied to apprehend the prisoner, his own sister came to me, she was crying and making lamentation; I went with her to Gee's court; she said it was a boy, and I thought I could master a boy myself, and I had no weapon with me; the young man at the bar was running, but he ran up into a house and his sister after him; she said, for God's sake come up, and we will get the property from him; I went up stairs into the front room where he was. and he 
               
                  drew
               


             this knife upon me, (producing it), and made three darts at me with it; then he was taken out of the front room into the back room by the lodgers and people in the house; and then the servant of the lady said, if they could but get the property from him they did not mean to do any more; then he went into the back room, and the door being half open, I peeped through into the room at the back part of the door where the hinges were, and saw in his hand a large watch, a time-piece I believe they call it.
Q. How was he taken there? - A. I look upon it the women to shelter him; it was a yellow watch as big again as my watch; upon that they took him out into the front room again, and I saw my life was in danger from the whole, and I gave it up; then I went down stairs, and stood in the passage of the house, and he had this knife in his hand, and said, will you stop me; I said, go like a thief as you are; and I was very glad when he was gone past me, for I had nobody to assist me, and then I lost sight of him.
THOMAS OLIVER sworn.
I am a watchman of Mary-le-bonne parish; I was called upon to apprehend the prisoner; I first saw the prisoner come out of Gee's-court, and then this young woman (the first witness), had hold of him by the arm, and she said to him, George, why don't you give me those watches; he did not say any thing to that, and I made answer and said, that is the man that we are after, and then I collared him; and when I collared him, the opposite party, the party that belonged to him, said to him, damn me, George, will you suffer yourself to be taken so easily; and he said, damn my eyes if I will, and he then up with his list, and struck me in the eye, and gave me a black eye, but it is gone off now, and from that the party that belonged to him rescued him out of my hand; after that he run down South Molton-street, and I followed him; says I, I will follow you till you are taken, and when I got to him, he said, damn your eyes if you shall, and struck me again three on four times; he was at last stopped the corner of James-street; I had fight of him till he was taken; when we had him taken to the watch-house, we searched him, but could not find any thing upon him.
Q. Do you know where Macklir got that knife from? - A. Yes; he had it in his hand when he was taken; I was present when it was taken out of his hands; he drew it at the corner of James-street; that was the first time that I saw the knife.
Prisoner. He collared me, and said I should go on beard a tender, and struck me several times.
Q. Did you strike him before he struck you? - A. No; I only collared him, I never struck him once.
Q. Did you ever threaten to take him on board the tender? - A. Never at all.

I assisted in taking the prisoner; I came up with him the corner of James street, where he was secured; I am a gardner by trade, I heard the cry of stop-thief, and saw a great mob of people, and I saw this young fellow with a drawn knife in his hand; I did not know what he had been at then, I did not stand hesitating but a very little while, but I rushed in upon him, and secured him, till he was taken to the watch-house; I don't know any thing of the property at all, he made an attempt with his knife at several people, but I cannot speak to any particular person, except myself.
Court. (To Withers.) Q. I suppose you don't know much of the value of these watches? - A. No.
Prisoner's defence. I went to the house to thank the lady for paying my bond; I saw captain Price go by, and I told the servant girl that I must speak to captain Price first; and I went to my lodgings, and the girl came after me, and said, I had robbed the house; I was going out to the East-Indies.

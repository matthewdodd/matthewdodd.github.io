            . On the 20th of December the prisoner came into my house, and had two pennyworths of beer, there came in another man, and called for a pint of beer, while I went to draw it, the prisoner took the shirt and handkerchief from the dresser, my wife came down about twenty minutes after, and missed the things, we went in search of the prisoner directly we went to several public houses, and found him at the Crown at Mim's Wash, with the shirt under his coat.

            . I was at work at Mr. Birkley's on the 20th of December, I saw the prisoner make towards the dresser, and then go out pretty sharp, I thought I saw him put something under his coat, we pursued him to the Crown at Mim's Wash, we found him standing at the fire, we charged him with taking the shirt and handkerchief, he confessed taking them, we found the shirt under his coat, we were informed at another public house, that he had sold the handkerchief for three-pence.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

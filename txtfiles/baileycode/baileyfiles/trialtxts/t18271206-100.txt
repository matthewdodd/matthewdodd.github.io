            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 19th of November, about seven o'clock, I saw all the four prisoners together in New Compton-street, trying at a shop-door - I watched them till near nine o'clock; they tried to get into a baker's, a bookseller's, and several shops; they got into Mr. Ellis' in Wardour-street


 - Burgess had a pair of list shoes on - Smith passed by the shop first; he and Burgess stood for a minute or two - Smith took a piece of cheese or bacon, the other two then went up, and Flood or Sullavan took a piece of something; they then all turned, and ran down a street - I got assistance, and pursued - I pushed them all into a house, and they dropped this cheese and bacon at my feet - I cannot say who dropped it.

            . I keep this shop; we had a lad to watch the window; a woman came in and bought something of him - I saw two lads pass the window, and take something, but I thought at first it was my own lad - I can swear to these articles - I have brought the corresponding pieces.
Prisoner BURGESS. Q. Did not you say, that your boy had sold it? A. No.

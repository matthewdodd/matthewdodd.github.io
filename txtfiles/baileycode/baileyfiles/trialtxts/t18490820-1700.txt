Esau Dodge: having been before convicted.






ESAU DODGE
. I live in Wellington-place, Blackfriars, On 10th Aug. the prisoner came, and spoke about buying a horse—he left some time after, and I missed a screw-wrench—I sent my servant after him—he refused to return—I have no doubt that he is the person.





NATHAN HAYWARD
. I am in the prosecutor's service. On 10th Aug., about ten minutes before four o'clock, the prisoner came—I was up in the loft—I saw him go to the cab, and take out a screw-wrench which I had put there—he called out for Mr. George, and asked him if he wanted to buy a horse—I saw him go away with the wrench.

Prisoner. Q. How was I dressed? A. You had a light drab coat and a cap on.

Prisoner. I had a hat on from three o'clock till five that day; I was at the Tom Thumb, in the New-cut; there was a sale there.





JAMES CUDDY
 (policeman, L 194). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at Newington—(read—Convicted Feb., 1847, and confined nine months)—he is the person—I have had him in custody since then, for threatening the life of his mother, and he had three months.

JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of April, 1 carcase of a sheep, value 21s., the property of 



Nicholas Shearley.






JAMES BRETT
. I am foreman to Mr. Nicholas Shearley, a butcher, in Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square. I purchased two sheep at Mr. Hicks', in Newgate-market, on the morning of the 11th of April—I gave them to Bell, to carry to the cart, in Newgate-street—I saw one of them afterwards at Guildhall—I have no doubt of it—I had bought the two hind and the two fore-quarters without the skin—I took such notice of it, I could swear it was the same—it was a Scotch sheep, brought up by the steam-boats; and the weight was the same as one of those I bought—the prisoner said he was in distress, and I believe he was.





GEORGE BELL
. Brett gave me the carcase of the sheep—I took it to the cart—I went back to fetch some more meat, and when I returned it was gone—I had seen the prisoner about twenty yards from the cart, when I put the carcase in, but he was not there when I went back—I made inquiry, and found the prisoner near the church in Newgate-street in about ten minutes, in the hands of Rice, the constable—I saw the carcase, which the officer had detained—I have no doubt it was one I had put into the cart.





DAVID GEORGE MORGAN
. I am an apprentice to a gentleman, in Tottenham-court-road. I was in Newgate-street, arid saw the prisoner standing opposite the cart—I watched him, and saw him take the sheep off—he put it on his shoulder, and went down Warwick-lane, and through College-market—I then lost sight of him, but saw him again in Giltspur-street—he was there taken with the same sheep, to the best of my belief.





GEORGE RICE
. I am a watchman. I took the prisoner with the sheep—the witness saw it, and identified it.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN M'PHERSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
22nd of February, 2 boxes, value 1s.; and 89lbs. weight of raisins, value 2l., the goods of 



Thomas Strange and another.






JOHN RUNACRES
. I live in Houndsditch, with Thomas and Samuel Strange—they are ray masters, and deal in raisins. I packed up two boxes of raisins together on the 22nd of February—they were worth 2l. each—they weighed 89lbs.—I marked them, and saw them loaded in the cart, in the City—these are them—I can swear to the boxes by the marks on them—they have not been opened.





GEOROE HOOPER
 (police-constable M 170.) I was on duty between seven and eight o'clock in Bermondsey-street, on Wednesday, the 22nd of February—a man came and told me something—in consequence of that I went after the prisoner, and found him, with these two boxes on his back—I asked where he got them from—he immediately threw them down and ran away—I took them.





JAMES TIDMARSH
 (police-constable M 51.) I heard the cry of "Stop theif"—I pursued and took the prisoner—he was the person that had the boxes.





WILLIAM MARSH
. I am a carter. I had the boxes in my cart, and was going to Stanton's Wharf, at the bottom of Morgan's-lane—I saw the prisoner and another at the foot of London-bridge—they seemed to stick pretty close to the cart—I looked as sharply as I could, and just as I turned Morgan's-lane the prisoner was very close to the cart, and I missed the boxes in two minutes, and the man also.


Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
(Joseph Tyrrell, a perfumer, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

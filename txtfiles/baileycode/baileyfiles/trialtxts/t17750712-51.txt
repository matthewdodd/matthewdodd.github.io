            , June 28th
.
The witnesses were examined apart as the request of the prisoner.
Harrison. On Tuesday the 9th of June 1774, I took the three bills mentioned in the indictment to Messrs. Raymond's and company, for acceptance; then I went to the bank to take out some bank post-bills; I put the bills into my pocket book. Coming through Pope's Head Alley, some persons came against me, and gave me a thrust; I thought it a mere accident, and did not take any notice of it; but by the time I got into Lombard-street, which is not a dozen yards further, I felt for my pocket-book, and missed it. I did not know who to suspect: I went immediately home and acquainted the gentlemen with it; we stopped payment at the different houses; and in about a month after, these three identical bills were discounted at a bank at Ipswich. I have the bills in my possession, they were drawn upon Raymond and company, payable to 
               
                  Richard
                   Clarke
               



            , or order at two months, and indorsed by him. Some months after the prisoner was taken up.
Q. From the prisoner. Whether you have not hanged some people for this very matter?
Harrison. For a forgery upon the bank post-bills, that were in the same pocket book.
Q. From the prisoner. Do you know any thing of me; will you say I picked your pocket?

Harrison. I know nothing of the prisoner.


                  Thomas
                   Brickmores
               



             The prisoner came to me upon the 26th of July, 1774, at Sprawton, near Ipswick, Suffolk, he asked a millar, a neighbour, who stood at the shop door, what the wheel-wright's name was? he told him. Bickmore. Then the prisoner asked me, if I could help him to an honest man that could be intrusted to carry a parcel for Lady Harland? my master said, I might go. The prisoner wanted to hire a horse, he asked the miller to let him one. The miller said, as it was for Lady Harland, he would not charge any thing; then he charged him a shilling; the prisoner said he would give him two, or a bottle of wine. I mounted the horse; he called me aside, and gave me a parcel, as though it was a letter, and bid me go to Garrat the banker, and bid him send lady Harland thirty pounds; he said he was going that way, and he should pass by and see me: but there are two roads, he did not know that; and he went one road and I another, so that he missed me. I got the money at the banker's, and sent in the cash to Lady Harland, as the prisoner had ordered me. Lady Harland was surprized. I received the cash of 
               
                  John
                   Emsant
               



            , Mr Garrat's clerk. I told Lady Harland, the gentleman told me, he should be at parson Jackson's, would see me pass by, and meet me there. She bid me go to parson Jackson, and tell the gentleman, I had delivered my message. I went there; he had not been there; I went on about my business; I was to bring twenty or thirty pounds in cash to Lady Harland, and the rest in bank notes. As I was coming from parson Jackson's a well-dressed man came riding along the road, and says, the young, man my master is greatly uneasy about the cash; he thought you had rode away with it. I said, no, that was not my disposition. He said, I must go further on the road for his master. I went on, and saw the prisoner. He said, where is the cash; I said I had left it at Lady Harland's, as he had ordered me. He said, how came you to leave it there. Then he ordered the servant to go back with me, and say, I had met the gentleman, and that it was a mistake. I went back, and I got the cash from Lady Harland, and the notes, and gave them to the man. My master thought I had been gone a long while; he asked the meaning of my staying. I told him; she suspected the fraud, and went and told Lady Harland. Lady Harland sent for me two hours after, and gave me a house to pursue him. I pursued him to a place called Kendall, and several gentlemen went with me; but he was not taken then.
Prisoner. The evidence on this matter has given his testimony diametrically opposite to what he gave before my Lord Mayor. I call Mr. Morgan to speak to that. Did not you declare before my Lord Mayor, that I gave you a parcel tied up in a brown paper with a cord?
Bickmore. I said, it was in a paper tied up.
Q. from the prisoner. How came you to tell my Lord Mayor that you never saw me any more, only my servant?
Bickmore. The man stood with his hat off, and called you his master.
Q. from the prisoner. Why did not you pick me out when you came to the prison to see me?
Bickmore. I saw him in the Compter, I knew him again.
Q. Why did not you point him out?
Bickmore. I could have picked him out from a thousand. I did not pick him out; I said in my own mind, that was the man; and I told the gentlemen so. I was bid not to speak there.


                  John
                   Enefant
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Garrat, a banker at Ipswich. The last witness, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bickmore
               



             brought a parcel to me containing three fifty-pound bills, drawn by Alday and Harrison, upon Sir 
               
                  Charles
                   Raymond
               



             and company; I gave him two thirty pound bank notes, three twenty-pound bank notes, twenty-three guineas and a half, twenty-nine shillings in silver, and the discount was thirteen shillings and six-pence, which made one hundred and fifty pounds.
Q. What is become of the notes.
Enefant. I remitted them up to Walpole, Clarke, and Brown, who are bankers for Mr. Garrat, and indorsed the notes payable to them, that they might receive the money of Sir 
               
                  Charles
                   Raymond
               



             and company, when the bills became due. I received them again of Mr. Coulson the clerk; I can swear these are the same notes, here is my hand-writing upon the back of every one of them.
Q. How came you to discount the notes?

Enesant. The bills were accepted, and gone a month, and we often discount bills of these persons Alday and Carrison. I put the bank notes into a piece of paper, sealed them and directed them to Lady Harland, and the money, I believe, I put into a bag the bank notes were in a parcel: I do not recollect the money being in a parcel.


                  Charles
                   Wilkinson
               



            . These notes are drawn upon our house, by Alday and Carrison of Norwich, and accepted by Emery, a clerk at our house: I know the hand-writing of both the drawer and acceptor.
The notes were read in court, and corresponded with the indictment.
Major Smith. On the 24th of July, 1774, I let the prisoner have a pair of horses for him and his friend; they went off at five in the morning; he came in the name of Thomas to me; he lived just by where I kept a livery stable then; he had had one or two before; he desired me to let him have two of the best horses I had, at five in the morning; I thought it odd he should introduce a friend that was a stranger. I went with the horses to see them set off; he gave my man a shilling; said, don't make yourself uneasy I am going to a gentleman's house; if I am not back by Thursday, I will send you a line. He did not come back for ten days; he said he belonged to some people, who, I afterwards found were what they call swindlers. Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             advised me to advertise them on Friday; I saw one of my horses advertised at Kelvedon; I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fieldings
               



            ', and told him of it; he gave me an order to go to Allhallows Lane. I went there, and found my horse; I went to a justice of the peace there, and swore to it, and had it delivered. When I came back to the Angel, at Clapton, the landlord asked me, if I had lost another; I said, yes: he said, he was at a Farmer's house at the other side of - heath.
Major Smith. When I went before the Lord-Mayor, I begged to see first if it was the same man; I went into Wood-street Compter, he took me into a private room, and offered me any money I would please to charge for both my horses, because they were both dead; but I would not be guilty of such a thing for the world.
Prosecutor. The notes produced are the same my pocket was picked off.
Prisoner's Defence.
My Lord-Mayor would not take cognizance of this man's affidavit; he was perjured before my Lord-Mayor. He came to the Compter, but was not admited to see my person, the Lord-Mayor granted me that indulgence, that nobody should see me. Another thing is, Mr. Morgan can justify, that the very countryman never mentioned that he ever saw my face again; the countryman said, I gave him a parcel, contained in a large piece of brown paper; that he went to the banker's, and got something, which he gave to another man, and that he never saw me again. Is that credible? I never set my eyes on him a second time. I want Mr. Morgan to say what evidence he gave before my Lord-Mayor at the time.
Mr. Morgan sworn.
Q. from the prisoner. Did not this man assign for reasons, he did not pick me out, that he did not chuse to be charged by these bloodhounds.
Morgan. I do not recollect any thing of that.
Q. Whether I was not acquitted of the matter before the Lord-Mayor, by the prosecutor himself?
Prosecutor. My Lord-Mayor ordered him to Newgate.
Prisoner. My Lord-Mayor said, if I had any sureties to bail me: I had nothing against me, but for a fraud.
Mr. Morgan. He was committed upon a different matter.
For the Prisoner.

             M'Coul. I am a sheriff's officer, I have known the prisoner six or seven years; he was in the brokering way; the brokery way, like other things, is a good deal of the humbug and buggle.

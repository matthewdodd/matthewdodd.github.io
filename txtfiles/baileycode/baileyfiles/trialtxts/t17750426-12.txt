            . I am shopman to the prosecutors who are partners


. On the 22d of this month, (last Saturday) about five in the afternoon the prisoner came to our shop; she bought two yards and a half of white cotton, which she paid for, she then went out of the shop; Mr. Rawle desired me to go after her, as he suspected she had taken something. I followed and stopped her, when she had not got twenty yards distant from the house; I told her, I believed she had taken something out of the shop: she said, she had not; I lifted up her cloak, and took this piece of muslin from under her left arm, which I am sure, is the prosecutors property.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

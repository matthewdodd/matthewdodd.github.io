GEORGE EVANS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Robert Robson, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ROBERT ROBSON
. I live in Long Acre. About nine o'clock, on the 8th of August, I was going down Snow-hill—I missed my handkerchief—I turned, and saw the prisoner running—this is my handkerchief—no one was near but the prisoner.





CHARLES GRANT
. I live in Alpha-grove, Holloway. I was in Farringdon-market, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner passed me—I followed him to Shoe-lane—he went into a house—he threw this handkerchief behind him—I took it up, and gave it to Mr. Robson.





FREDERICK RUSSELL
 (City police-constable, No. 503.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

            . I was fourteen years old last October; I saw the prisoner at Brewer's Key take some tobacco out of a hogshead, and put it between his shirt and skin, and go up the gateway; I called Mr. Ward; he followed him and took him; Ward searched him, and found this tobacco upon him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw a man doing something under the gateway, I did not know what; when he was gone I went to see what it was, and found this tobacco and took it up.

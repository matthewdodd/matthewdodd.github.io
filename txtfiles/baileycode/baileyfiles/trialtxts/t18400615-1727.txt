JOSEPH VANNER
was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of June, 1 cap, value 6d., the goods of 



Henry Bakewell; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY BAKEWELL.
I live in Church-street, Bethnal-green, and am a hatter. Last Saturday morning I had five caps placed on a hat-bol at iny door—I went out, and saw the prisoner walking on with a cap on his head—I went and took him with the cap on him—this is it—(looking at it)—it is mine—he had no right to have my cap.

Prisoner. I bought the cap of his wife the day before—I gave her 1s., and she gave me 6d. change—he wanted me to pay for it again, and I would not—when the officer came I took 1s. out to pay for it, and the woman did not recollect any thing of the kind. Witness. We had not sold such a cap the day before.





ELIZABETH AGGAR.
I live in Church-street. On that morning I was looking out of my mistress's window, which is opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's door, reach, and take the cap from a stand—he put it under his coat, and then on his head—I went and told the prosecutor.

Prisoner. She said before, that I crossed and took it from a board, and now she says from a stand—I had been to her mistress's shop to breakfast, and was crossing, and combing my hair—I dropped my cap, I picked it up, put it on my head, and went on with it.





GEORGE KEMP.
I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person, and I have had him since that—he is the most infa mous thief I ever knew in my life.

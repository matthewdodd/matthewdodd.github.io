Q. When did you loose your beef - A. On Saturday night the 21st of January, about ten o'clock in the evening. The prisoner ran up to the side of the stall and took the beef off the board; he took it, and run away with it, my father pursued him and took him with the beef upon him.
Prisonor's Defence. I am a poor man, I am lost for want of a friend to come and speak for me, I had no beef upon me, when I was taken, I never took the beef.

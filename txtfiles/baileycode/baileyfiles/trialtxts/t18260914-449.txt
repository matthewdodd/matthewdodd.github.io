            . I am in the employ of Pontifex and Co. On the 29th of July I saw some cock-metal separated from the mass, and laid in a place, as I supposed, to be taken away - the prisoner was in their employ; when he was gone to dinner, a constable was sent for - he went after him, and he was taken - this parcel was found on him.

            . I am in partnership with Edmund Pontifex and another - we live in Shoe-lane


; we have above a hundred men in our employ, and a great quantity of metal; the prisoner had 1l. a week.

            . I am a constable. On the 29th of July I took the prisoner, just as he left the premises, and found on him this 7lbs of metal concealed in his trousers pockets, his frock-pockets, and about him; he did not account for how he got; he said it was through distress.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

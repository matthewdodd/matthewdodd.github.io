JOHN FLETCHER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



Henry Welfare, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY WELFARE
. I live in Castle-street, Southwark. On the morning of the 10th of Sept. I was at the foot of London-bridge—a policeman spoke to me, I put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief from my coat-pocket, where it had been safe about five minutes before—this is my handkerchief.





EDWARD FUNNELL
 (City police-constable, No. 594.) I saw the prisoner, and another lad with him—I watched them, and saw the prisoner take this

handkerchief from Mr. Welfare's pocket, and put it into his own blouse—I ran and took him, and took the handkerchief out of his blouse—I went to the prosecutor, and asked him if he had lost anything—he said he had lost his handkerchief, and owned to this.

Prisoner. I did not take it out.





WILLIAM GUEST
 (police-constable L 62.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

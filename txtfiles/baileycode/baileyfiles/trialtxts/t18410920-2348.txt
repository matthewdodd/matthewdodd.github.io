WILLIAM HARRISS
. I am a policeman. On the 7th of September

about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner about five yards from Mr. Abraham's premises, in the New-road, Pentonville—in consequence of suspicion, I asked what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing"—I asked if he had any thing about him—he said, "No"—I felt in his coat-pocket, and found two pieces of brass, and a tin tube—in his other coat-pocket five more portions of a lamp, and under his arm the bottom of the lamp—I knocked Mr. Abrahams up, and he found his shop broken open.





ABRAHAM ABRAHAMS
. I keep a broker's-shop at Pentonville. The policeman brought the prisoner to me with these articles, which are mine—I saw them safe the day before, in the middle of the day, in my shop, which was locked up at night—I found the back-door broken open in the morning.





HENRY LEE
. I am in the prosecutor's service. I fastened the shop at ten o'clock on the night of the 5th, and next morning the back door was broken open.

Prisoner. There was no lock on the door.





DANIEL HALEY
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I was present at his trial—he is the man.

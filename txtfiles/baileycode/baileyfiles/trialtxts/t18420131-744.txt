EPHRAIM MALBOROUGH
. I am assistant to William Hamper, a hosier, in Newgate-street. The prisoner came into the shop on the 1st of February, at a quarter after four o'clock—he asked the price of some silk scarfs—I said 12s. or 14s.—he was about to leave—I said I could show him some cheaper, which I did—he did not like them—I got some out of the window—he seemed to like one—he said "What is this?"—I said 6s. 6d.—he put it into his breast, and ran out—I ran, and brought him back—he then threw the scarf on the counter.

Prisoner. I paid for it. Witness. I saw no money, and took none.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

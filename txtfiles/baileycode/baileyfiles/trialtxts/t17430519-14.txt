                  Susanna 
                  Cuttle 
               



             . My Child was taken from me the 11th of this Month, about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon; and was brought home to me stark naked, about Eleven o'Clock at Night; she is a bout four Years and a quarter old; and had on that Day, the Cloaths mentioned in the Indictment. after they had stripped my Child, they sat her over a Vault, and she straddled over the Seat of the Vault *, and came into a Place called Crown Alley; the Person that found the Child, and washed her, said, that the Child told her her Name was Cuttle , and told her where she lived. The Prisoner told me, she pawned the Frock for a Shilling, in the Name of 
               
                  Ann 
                  White 
               



            , on Saffron-Hill ; and I went and fetched it; tho' she goes by the Name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  White 
               



            ; and she told me, she sold the Skirt, and quilted Petticoat in Mrs Peirce's House, to an old Cloaths Woman; but she did not own, she took them from the Child.
* Ann Pendegrass, otherwise Church, was committed by Mr Alderman Bernard, on Oath of 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Cuttle 
               



            , on Suspicion of stripping her Child, and afterwards dropping her into a Vault: She was discharged on the Goal delivery. - Mrs Cuttle, does not give Evidence here, of the Child's being in the Vault; yet from the Child's being washed, and what is sworn by Mrs Stone, it should seem the Child was taken out of the Vault.


                  Mary 
                  Bird 
               



            . I keep a Shop in Long-Lane; the Prisoner came to my Shop with 
               
                  Ann 
                  Peirce 
               



             , last Friday, and offered to sell me an old Pair of Child's Shoes, a little old Shift, a Flannel Petticoat, and an old Skirt; she said, that her Child was dead, and that she sold them for Necessity, because she wanted Money: I did not much Care to buy them, for I said, they were too old for me; she said, she had been bid Six-Pence for them, by an old Cloaths W oman; 
               
                  Ann 
                  Peirce 
               



             , said, she lodged with her, in her House, and gave her a good Character; so I bought them of her, and gave her Six-pence for them.
Q. Did you receive these things of Peirce, or of the Prisoner?
Bird. I received them of the Prisoner; these are the Things the Prisoner brought to me.


                  Susannah 
                  Cuttle 
               



            . These are my Daughter's Cloaths.


                  Ann 
                  Peirce 
               



             *. On Wednesday seven-night, this Girl was brought to lodge with me; I was told, she was a very honest Girl; she did agree with an old Cloaths Woman for some things, but not these; they were things that were worth but little; and she said, her Mother was in the Workhouse, and gave her these things to sell, to get her a few Farthings to buy something. - I believe these are the things she had; I know she took Six-pence for some things, when I was with her.
* This Witness was committed on the Oath of 
               
                  Robert 
                  Stone 
               



            , for robbing 
               
                  Ann 
                  Stone 
               



            , and 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Cuttle 
               



            , after the Prisoner White had been in Custody .


                  Martha 
                  Stone 
               



            . About half an Hour after Eleven, in the Day-Time, my Child was taken away, and stripped; she stripped them both.
Court. That Child is not in Question; you ought not to give any Account of any foreign Matter: How do you know she stripped this Girl?
Stone. She owned it going along, and told us, where we might find the Things; but she would not own, that she put 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Cuttle 
               



             down the Vault; and at first would not own, she stripped her; but said, she had the Things of a young Woman; the Prisoner said, she carried the Child to Mrs Philpot, in Chick-lane: She owned she took the Frock off the Child's Back, and pawned it herself.
Prisoner. I am sure, I never said any such thing; for I know nothing at all of the Matter.
Q. Did not the Prisoner deny taking the things off the Child's Back?
Stone . She owned every thing; she owned the taking all the things off the Child's Back.
Prisoner. I lived at Mrs Peirce's in Grub-Street, three Nights; and Mrs. Peirce gave me these things to sell; I did not know where to sell them; so I went and pawned the Frock; and I thought they were her own, for she used to send me sometimes to pawn things for her. - My Mother is at present in Sepulchre's Workhouse, but my Father is dead. 


               Guilty of the Felony only

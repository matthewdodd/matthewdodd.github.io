MARTIN LANE



, stealing 1 purse, value 2s., 2 sovereigns, 2 half-crowns, 3 shillings, and 4 sixpences; the property of 



Selina Burton, from her person.






SELINA BURTON
. I am single. I was going up Holborn on 3rd April, about twelve o'clock—I felt my dress pulled—I looked round, and saw the prisoner—he ran down Field-lane, and I followed him—I found I had lost a steel bead purse, containing two sovereigns, two half-crowns, three shillings, and some sixpences—I gave notice at the station, and I have not seen it since—there were two or three loose-looking characters in front of me at the time the prisoner was by me, but I do not know them—I had had my purse just before in Farringdon-street.

Prisoner. Q. At what part was it? A. Just on the rise of Holbornhill—I saw your fingers at my dress, on the right side, where my pocket was.






JOHN MOST
 (City-policeman, 225). I took the prisoner on 5th April in Smithfield—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing of it—I searched him, and found four half-crowns, a sixpence, and threepence in copper, and a silk handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. The officer said if I could satisfy him where I was at the time, he would release me; I was going about with washleathers, and I could not recollect where I was.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years,


(Several officers stated the prisoner was in the habit of training infant thieves, and that he had been convicted,)

            . I am a widow, and live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell


; the prisoner's mother lives at the bottom of the street - I often employed her. On the 5th of February she scoured out a lower room for me. I went out, left her at work, and went to her mother's, which is five doors off; when I returned I found her gone, and the door open. I found my drawers open, and the things stated in the indictment gone. Her mother went with me all day in pursuit of her, and on Tuesday I found her in Chequer-alley, Golden-lane; she would not open the door to me until I fetched an officer. I found my bonnet on the bed, and she was drying my apron by the fire; the officer took her. She said she had robbed me, and pledged the gown in Golden-lane.
DIX MORE. I am an officer. On the 8th of February I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

WILLIAM HAWES
. I am a traveller to all parts of London. On the 29th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Long-lane, Smithfield—Bane came and spoke to me, and wanted me to treat her to a pint of porter—I said I had no money—she still continued to walk along the pavement, took hold of my arm, and called the other prisoner up on my other side—we walked on for five or ten yards together, and then Smith chucked me under the chin, and drew the pin out of my scarf, and ran away—Bane had at that time hold of my arm—I left Bane, and ran after Smith—this pin now produced is mine.





JOHN BRAND
 (City police-constable, No. 229.) I was coming down the lane, and saw the prosecutor running after Smith—I took Smith, and the prosecutor said there was a second one with her, who had bold of his arm—I looked round—Bane was across the road, and was talking to two girls—I got her, and then, just as I got to Smith again, I saw her throw her hand out, and I saw this pin on the ground, by her right foot—I laid hold of both the prisoners—a man coming by took up the pin, and gave it me.

ANN BANE—


NOT GUILTY

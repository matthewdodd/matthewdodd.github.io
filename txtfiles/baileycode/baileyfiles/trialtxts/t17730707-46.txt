I am a brush-maker on Snow-hill: as I was at breakfast I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket and put it under his coat; I ran out and laid hold of him; I opened his coat; he snatched hold of the handkerchief and endeavoured to throw it down a cellar window, but it lodged on the bars; I called the gentleman and delivered the handkerchief to

Prisoner's Defence.
Going down Snow-hill I saw a boy pick the gentleman's pocket, and ran down by Fleet-market; the man laid hold of me; I said there he goes, but they would not go after him but stopped me.
He called one witness who gave him a good character.

s, and live in Oxford-street


. I was at home on the 30th of March, but I did not see the sugar taken; a person called out that a man had taken it - I looked out, and saw it.
CHARLES WALL. I was near the shop; I had seen the prisoner and another together, and the other one made an attempt at twenty or thirty shops - they at last came to the prosecutor's, and took this sugar - I gave the alarm; I cannot say which of them took it, but I saw the prisoner with it, and took him with it.
Prisoner. I was going to see a person and saw a mob - I went up to the place, and a person asked me to carry this for him; I had not got more than four or five yards from the shop when I was taken.

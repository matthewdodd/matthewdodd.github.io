WILLIAM NOBLE.
 I live at King-street. Hammersmith, and am a tobacconist. On Thursday, 11th May, about half-past six o'clock, I was talking to Mr. Millward, who lives next door, and saw the prisoner coming out of my shop—he made for the road—I went after him, hallooing, and saw him stopped—I had not lost night of him—I brought him back to my shop and in his left pocket I found these eight Cubs cigars, and two pipes (produced)—they are mine, and had been safe in my window.

RICHARD MILLWARD. I keep the White Bear, next door to Mr. Noble. I was talking to him about six o'clock, on 11th May, and saw the prisoner come out of his house—Noble went after him—he was stopped, brought back, and I saw the cigars taken from him.

Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing on me.





GEORGE LOW.
 I produce a certificate—(read—Florence Stevens, convicted 17th Aug., 1846, having been before convicted, and confined six months)—I was present—he is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Baron Alderson.

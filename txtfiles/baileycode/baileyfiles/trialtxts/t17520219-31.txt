                  Lacy 
               



            . I am a breeches-maker
; on the 3d of this month one 
               
                  Charles 
                  Sculley 
               



             sent his servant to my house to let me know he had stopped a pair of breeches: I went to his house in Rosemary-Lane, he shewed me these breeches, they are my property. (Produced in court.) I found Doyle in a house in Mill-yard, and asked him how he came by the breeches, shewing him them? he said he had them of a sailor ; I sent for an officer and carry'd him before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            ; there he confessed he had them of 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Gready 
               



            ; she was at that time my servant; that she gave them to him; then they were both committed to Clerkenwell-Bridewell: going there she said, dear Sir, be favourable to me, and I'll make you satisfaction for these breeches, acknowledging she took them.
Q. In what capacity was she in your house?
Lacy. She was not to assist in the shop, she was house maid.
Q. Did you make her any promise you would let her go if she would confess?
Lacy. No, my lord, I did not.

            . Doyle the prisoner brought these breeches to me, and told me a friend of his had them to dispose of, and he chose I should have them sooner than another; I asked the price, he said he'd go and ask, and left them with me; I saw the prosecutor's mark upon them, I sent to him, he came, and told me they where his property, then we took up the prisoner, after which he told us Eleanor Gready gave them to him; we took her up, she denied it, and said she knew nothing of them.

            . I am servant to Mr. Lacy, I exposed these very breeches to sale, the first day of this month, in his shop, after I had shut up the shop; how they went out I know not; Doyle said before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , he had them of Gready on a Sunday evening, at a house where they met: she said there she was sitting in an ale-house, and the breeches were handed about, and that Doyle had them of a sailor.
Gready's defence.
I had these breeches of my mistress to sell for her.
Doyles defence.
I had them of my fellow prisoner: she came into the Scute where I was and exposed them to file, I had done some services for her, she gave them to me as a recompence: if I had known they were Mr. Lacy's property, I would not have accepted such a thing.

                  GARLAND
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Pengree, Grenfell, and Granville? - A. Yes.
Q. Have you for some time past known the prisoner at the bar? - A. About a twelvemonth past.
Q. What business is he? - A. A brazier
, I believe.
Q. Has he come to Messrs. Pengree and Grenfell for this last twelvemonth past? - A. Yes, he has been in the habit of coming there about four times a week.
Court. Q. To purchase copper? - A. Yes.
Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember his coming there on Saturday, the 15th of June? - A. Yes.
Q. In consequence of any thing you had before observed, did you conceal yourself that day for the purpose of watching him? - A. I did.
Q. Did you conceal yourself in a place where he did not see you? - A. It is possible that he might have seen my head.
Q. You took good care he should not see you? - A. I did; I saw him go to the shelf upon which some copper was placed, and take as much as he could grasp in his hand, and put it underneath his waistcoat.
Q. Was any person by to observe him at that time? - A. There was a man in the warehouse, he was employed; the prisoner's back was towards him; he was watching him as well as me.
Q. Was the person so employed that the prisoner had reason to believe he was not observing him at the time? - A. Yes; on perceiving this, I went and fetched a constable, his name is Cummins; when I came back with Cummins, the prisoner was in the warehouse; he had got four pounds of copper, which he had looked out by way of purchasing it; I gave charge of him to Cummins; I told him that I had seen him steal the copper, he had it then under his waistcoat.
Q. Did the constable search him? - A. He did not give him leave; the prisoner directly put his hands under his waistcoat, and hauled out the copper; he appeared very much agitated; he said it was the first time, and begged that we would forgive him; the copper was put into the hands of the constable.
Prisoner. Q. Were not you at your desk in the warehouse at the time I came in? - A. Yes, I was.
Q. As to your attempting to say you concealed yourself is a falsity? - A. Immediately upon his entering the warehouse, I left it, and went into the place of concealment.
Jury. Q. How did you conceal yourself? - A. On the top of the stairs leading to the floor above; I looked over.
Court. Q. It is possible he might have seen you? - A. I do not think he did.
Jury. Q. Had you any reason to think he had robbed you before? - A. I think he had.
Court. That is a tender question to ask.
- CUMMINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On Saturday, the 15th of June, were you sent by Garland to take the prisoner into custody? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you see him take any thing out of his waistcoat? - A. Yes, that copper; I produce it.
Q. (To Garland.) Are these the pieces of copper you saw him put under his waistcoat? - A. These are the pieces of copper that he put under his waistcoat; they are saucepan bottoms, they are worth twenty-eight shillings.
Q. They are the property of Messrs. Pengree and Grenfell? - A. They are.
Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of coming to that warehouse upwards of a twelvemonth; I have purchased a great many bottoms exactly as them, and amongst some of them are the bottoms that I have purchased.
Court. Q. Prove it - were they purchased that day? - A. No, that day I had not.
Q. You heard what the witnesses said - you were seen to take it, and put it under your waistcoat, and the constable saw you take it from under your waistcoat? - A. I have been in the habit of buying at that warehouse a great while; there has been a ton weight sold at that warehouse of pieces of copper, both in shape and size of them.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

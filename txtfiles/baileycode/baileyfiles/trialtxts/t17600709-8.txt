. +
Eliz. Roberts. My husband's name is Fra. Roberts; the prisoner came to my house the 13th of June last, to sell me a pair of shoes. I had occasion to go out to sell things in the street. I came home at 10 o'clock, and was getting supper; she came in again, and ask'd me to buy a handkerchief of her; she said she had a sick husband, and a child out at nurse. I said I would not buy it. I stripp'd my children to wash their little things; she said, she wou'd stay and help me; I then said, I wou'd give her 2 d. an hour. She took the childrens two cotton gowns, a bonnet, a pair of old stays, a blue and white cheque apron, and a copper saucepan, and went away with them. I found the stays in her lodgings, and found her drinking in an alehouse with my bonnet by her; ( pro duc'd in court, and depos'd to) I never found the other things.
Q. When did you find them again?
E. Roberts. The day after I lost them.
Prisoner's defence.
I bought these stays in Rag fair for 9 d. I was quite in liquor; as to any thing else, I know nothing at all of it.

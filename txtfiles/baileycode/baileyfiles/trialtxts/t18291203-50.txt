. On the 14th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for while I was absent, and told there was a boot stolen - the officer had it, and I found it was mine; this is the boot - I had left it safe about a quarter of an hour before.
WILLIAM BIDGOOD. I am a cabinet-maker. On the 14th of November I saw the prisoner and two others at the prosecutor's door - one of his companions took the boot from just inside the door, and gave it to the prisoner, who was close to this elbow; when he took it he put it under his coat, and crossed the road; I took him back- he said, "I did not take the boot, a boy gave it to me."
EDWARE OKELL. I am a constable. I took him into custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up the road, and saw two boys running - they chucked the boot to me; I ran, and that gentleman took me.

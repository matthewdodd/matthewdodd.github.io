; the prisoner called at my house the beginning of March; I being busy she staid and assisted me in making-up my work, and staid at my house all that and the next night; I got up and went out on business, and left her to take care of the things and my house, and when I returned I missed the bed-gown and her; I heard she was in Newtoner's Lane; I went there and took her and charged her with taking the gown; she said, she was coming to me, and designed to bring it to me, and was very sorry for what she had done. I took her to an officer, and the next morning to a justice, she owned it there; then she went and asked for it at the pawnbroker's with me, and it was delivered to us; [the bedgown produced in court and deposed to: and the pawnbroker deposed the prisoner brought it there and pledged it. ]
Prisoner's Defence.
The prosecutrix delivered the bedgown into my hands, and I did pawn it.
Q. to prosecutrix. Did you deliver it to her?
Prosecutrix. No; I did not.

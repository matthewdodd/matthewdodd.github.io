            . I had orders to send in two bushels of coals, and change for a guinea, to Mr 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Walker 
               



            's, in Long-row, Coverly-fields. I brought them, and laid the guinea down upon a chair, while I give the change; and went away, and forgot to take up the guinea. I returned in about two minutes, and the guinea was gone. The prisoner was servant there. I suspected her having it, and charged her with it. She denied it. She having got some new things, and was got drunk, we had farther suspicion; and upon charging her again, she acknowledged she had taken it. This she did before the constable, and all the justices. I never recovered it again.
Mr. Walker confirmed the account of the prisoner's confession.

I know nothing about it.

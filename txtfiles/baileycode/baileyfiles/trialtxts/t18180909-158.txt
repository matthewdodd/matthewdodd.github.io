            . I am servant to Mr. Meredith, who is a cow-keeper, and lives in the New-road. On the 27th of August, between six and seven o'clock, in the morning, I stopped the prisoners in the Hampstead-road, each had a bundle of lead, I told them I took them on suspicion of stealing it; they made no answer.

            . I am servant to Mr. Meredith. I saw the prisoners about half-past six o'clock in the morning, going through a field opposite my house, which is about half a mile from the prosecutor's-one had an empty bag and the other a cloth; in about ten minutes I saw them again in the field, they were then loaded. I desired Walker to follow them. They had not time to go to the prosecutor's house.

            . I am a varnish-maker, and live in one of the prosecutor's houses; the house the lead was taken from is next but one to mine.

It was safe the day before.

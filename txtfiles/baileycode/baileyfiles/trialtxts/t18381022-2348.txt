8th of October, 1 half-crown, 9 shillings, 2 sixpences, 4 pence, and 67 half-pence, the monies of

JANE PHILLIPS
. I am the wife of William Phillips, and live in Molyneux-street, Marylebone. About twenty minutes past nine o'clock on the 8th of April, I saw the prisoner pass my window with my till under his arm—I pursued him, crying, "Stop thief," and he was stopped, but he put down the till in a door-way—I gave him into custody—this is my till—it had my money in it.





WILLIAM PRATT
. I live at No. 79, Edgeware-road, and am errandboy. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and stopped the prisoner.





JOHN FUZZ ENS
 (police-sergeant R 17.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's offices—(read)—he is the person who was convicted.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

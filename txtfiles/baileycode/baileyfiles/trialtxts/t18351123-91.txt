WILLIAM COLLINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of November, at 
St. Michael, Bassishaw, 22 yards of woollen-cloth, value 17l., the goods of 




William Playne and others, in their dwelling-house.






JOHN BASSETT
. I am clerk to William Playne and two other partners, woollen-manufacturers, in Gloucestershire—they have a town-house in Basinghall-street, in the parish of St. Michael, Bassishaw—the firm pay the rent from the profit—our porter and town-traveller sleep on the premises. On Wednesday last, I was in the counting-house, about a quarter before eleven o'clock—It is an inner place from the warehouse—I was standing at the desk, and heard a noise at the warehouse-door—I immediately stepped from the counting-house to the warehouse-door, and saw the prisoner with an end of cloth in his possession—I saw him going down the court into Basinghall-street—I pursued him a little way down the street, into Church-passage, and overtook him—he had the end of cloth in his possession—It is worth 17l.—he threw it down at my feet, and I caught him—he put himself in a supplicating position, and said a man had given him 1s. to fetch the cloth, and for the sake of his poor father, begged he might not be taken into custody—he was a stranger to us.





ABRAHAM CRISP
. I am a police-constable. I took him into custody.


Prisoner. A man enticed me away from my home, and told me to do it.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor, on account of his youth.—



Confined One Year, and then 


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Baron Alderson.

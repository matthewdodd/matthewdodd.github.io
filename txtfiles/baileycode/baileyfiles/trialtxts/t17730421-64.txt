            : he keeps a stocking shop
 in the Strand


. The two prisoners about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, this day week, came into my shop; Spencely asked for purple stockings; I said I had none; then she asked for black; I reached her some; she said they were too coarse; then I reached some other black stockings; they talked about the price, and during this time Lloyd sat down in an arm chair, complaining she was ill, and begged to so; I observed at the time, she put her hand upon the counter, and snatched away a bundle of black stockings which belong to a gentleman, and were sent to me to wash; upon seeing this, I immediately cried stop thief! they both instantly ran away; they were brought back to the shop, and I can swear they are my property. I do not believe Spencely was concerned in it. Mr. King brought them to me; he is not here.
Lloyd called several witnesses who gave her a good character.
As there was no evidence to affect Spencely the Court did not put her upon her defence.
SPENCELY 

               acquitted
            .
LLOYD 

               guilty

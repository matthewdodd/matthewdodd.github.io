                     Cross , alias 
Williams




               
            , of St. Andrews Holbourn


 was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Portmanteau Trunk, a Cloth Coat, Wastcoat and Breeches, a pair of Scarlet Breeches laced with Gold Lace, and 7 Holland Shirts, in all to the value of 13 l.
             the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Joseph 
                     Neal 
                  




                
            , on the 19th of October
 last. It appeared that Captain
 Neal and his Servant came to Town that Night, and that his Man carried the Horses and Portmanteau to Warwicks Stables


, and while he and two or three more were busy about the Horses in the Stables, the Prisoner, who was Lurking about the Yard, took the Portmanteau out of the Stable and carryed it off. That afterwards the Captain's Servant seeing the Prisoner in the Bear and Harrow Tavern in Butcher Row with his Master's Clothes on his back, apprehended him. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded that he bought the Clothes in Newtoners Lane, and that the Prosecutor searched a House in Leather Lane, where he found some of his Goods; to prove the former he called one 
               
                  William 
                  Beggar 
               



            , who deposed that he lodged in the same House with the Prisoner, and saw their Landlord lend the Prisoner a Guinea to buy the Clothes, and saw him buy them; but being ask'd what Colour they were, and to describe them, said, they were a light Colour, lined with a light Silk, and trim'd with a Silver; which Description happened to be wrong, for the Clothes being produc'd and swore to by the Prosecutor to be his, and by his Man to be the same that were taken from off the Prisoner, proved not to be very light, but lined with a Blue Silk and no Trimming at all. The Jury found him 

               Guilty

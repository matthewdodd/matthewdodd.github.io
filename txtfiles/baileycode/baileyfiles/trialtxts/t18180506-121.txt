            . I am a carpenter. I was passing the prosecutor's door, and saw the prisoner run out of the back room with the watch in a glass. He knocked off his hat, picked it up, and appeared confused. I called the prosecutor out, who took the prisoner in Pennington-street - he immediately gave it to me.

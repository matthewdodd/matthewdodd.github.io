            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors, who live in Swithin's-lane


. On the 9th of June, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, several chests of tea were brought to the door in a waggon; the carman had gone for refreshment. I heard an alarm, ran out, and found Mr. Smith in pursuit - I joined him, and saw the prisoner in Sherborne-lane with the chest of tea on his shoulder; he was secured at the bottom of the lane by Macdonald. I saw him throw the chest down before he was stopped. It was my masters' property.

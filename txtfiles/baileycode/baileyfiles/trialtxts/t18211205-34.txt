            . I live with Mr. Round. No. 25, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly


. On the 23d of November, about three o'clock, I was cleaning the drawing-room windows, and saw both the prisoners come and stand with their backs to my master's front door, one of them walked down Sir 
               
                  William 
                  Adams
               



            's area, which is next door, and then the other after him; the first that went down went into the cellar, the other followed - in about a minute the first came out of the cellar and both went in doors, and in about half a minute one came out and looked back for the other, who brought out the box coat, rolled it up, and gave it to the other, who walked into the cellar with it, the other looked up and said "Away with it," and flung his hand out; I ran down into the street and shut myself into the area with them - rang the door bell - the footman came and they were taken in the area.
Prisoner BOSWELL. Q. Where were you - A. In the middle balcony.

            . I live with Sir 
               
                  William 
                  Adams
               



            . In consequence of what Goddard said, I looked down into the area and saw the two prisoners, I immediately locked the gate, and then went into the hall. Goddard said they had brought the coat out and put it in the cellar. I looked into the cellar but it was not there, there was a coal cellar just by, I did not look there but went back into the servants' hall, but it was not there, I went up and alarmed my master, and when I came back I found it thrown on some lumber in the hall, rolled up; it was not there when I went up. I suppose it was in the coal cellar, which is about a yard and a half from the dust-hole. I do not know the value, it had been in wear two years I should think. I saw it safe at twelve o'clock hanging in the hall.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

             re-examined. I staid in the area with them but did not keep my eye on them, as one or two friends came to the gate and talked with me. I said it was in the cellar, both the dust-hole and coal place are cellars, they could have moved it while I ran down stairs.

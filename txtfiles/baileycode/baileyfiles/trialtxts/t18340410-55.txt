            . I live at No. 85, Long-lane, Smithfield


. On the afternoon of the 29th of March I was in the parlour at the back of the shop - I saw the prisoner and another boy come into the shop - the prisoner asked for a pocket-comb - I showed him several - they bought nothing, but went out of the shop; and in about five minutes came back again - the prisoners stood very close to the counter, in front of it - one of them said, "I want one of these combs" - I went into the shop to serve him, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop with some combs in his hand - I followed him, crying, "Stop thief!" till he dropped them - I took them up, and the police pursued after him - I am sure he is the boy - he dropped seven combs, which had been in the glass case before I came in the shop - they are the property of William Gillingwater - I am his sister-in-law.

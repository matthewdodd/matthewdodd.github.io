THOMAS MOSS
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of December, 2 feet of leaden pipe, value 3s., the goods of 



John Smith, and fixed to a building.






JOHN CHURCH
. I am a silk-dyer, and live at No. 64, Milton-street. On the 11th of December, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I heard a person go along the passage—I got up, went into the yard, and found the prisoner with this piece of pipe in his left hand, which had been just broken from the wall—he dropped it, and made a push to get by me—I had a scuffle with him in the passage—he ran off, I pursued him, and he was taken by the watchman.





JOHN SMITH
. This pipe is my property—I have fitted it to the place where it was taken from—Church lives below, and I up stairs—this piece of pipe was put in the room of one the prisoner stole before.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

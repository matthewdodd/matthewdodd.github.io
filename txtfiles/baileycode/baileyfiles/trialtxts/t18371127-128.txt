WILLIAM GREEN
. I am a clerk, and live in Vine-street, York-road. On the 20th of November I was seeing the Queen go to the House of Lords, in Great George-street, Westminster—I knew my handkerchief was safe before—I took it from my hat and put it into my pocket not five minutes before I lost it—I heard some one call out that I bad lost my handkerchief—I turned, the two prisoners were close to me, and the officer and got them—the policeman showed me the handkerchief—I did not see it in possession of either of the prisoners—this is my handkerchief





WILLIAM HOLLAND
. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 20th of November—I saw the two prisoners and one other with them, about two o'clock—they had nothing in their hands then—I saw Jones go up to the coat-tail of the prosecutor, and come away with the handkerchief in his right hand—I collared him, and called out, "Where is the handkerchief?—the prosecutor turned round, and a policeman came up in uniform—I was in plain clothes, and we took them to the station—when I said, "Where is the handkerchief?" a voice exclaimed, "Here it is," and picked it up at the back of Johnson—I searched Jones—he had 2s. on him.

            . The prisoner and I lodged together. I found a pair of my stockings in his pocket the day they were taken away; he took them out of my chest .
Q. Was your chest locked?
Carter. I do not know whether it was or not, the key was in it. The prisoner staid out all night; and when he came home in the morning , I saw his pockets stick out; I searched him and found the stockings there. He confess'd he stole the other things , and would have me go along with him to the persons where he sold them. He sold the flannel waistcoat in Spittle-fields, and the shirt in Rag fair.
Q. Did he take them out of your chest?
Carter. Only the stockings were in the chest, the other things were in my room.
Prisoner's Defence. I thought the stockings had been my own; I put them into my pocket to go to have them wash'd, and he said they were his.

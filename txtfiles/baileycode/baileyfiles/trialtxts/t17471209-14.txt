            . On the 20th of last month, between the hours of six and seven, I was walking by the Bishop of Ely's house


: I put my hand to my pocket and mist my handkerchief; upon this I caught hold of the Prisoner. He had a red handkerchief like mine, I made him pull the handkerchief off, but that was not mine; but my handkerchief he had thrown out of his hand. The Prisoner stood close to me when I mist my handkerchief.

            . The gentleman lay'd hold of him; I came up while he was speaking to him; the gentleman said, I suppose you are one of the gang; I said, I was not; I said, Sir, there is your handkerchief; I saw him take it out of your pocket and throw it over the rails; the handkerchief was pickt up, and Mr. Seymore swore to it.

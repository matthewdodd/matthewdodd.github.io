CHARIES CARTWRIGHT
. I live at Manchester. I was in Fleet-street on the 14th of June, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, returning from the opera—I felt my handkerchief going out of my pocket—I turned round, and saw it on the ground, and the prisoner was running away—I did not see it in his hand, but the moment I turned I saw it descending from his hand to the ground—I know it fell from him, because he was running away, and there was no one there but him—I took it up, and ran after him—he was stopped by the officer—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner. Q. What can you swear to it by? A. By the pattern—there is no mark, but the manufacture is peculiar, and it has never been washed.





WILLIAM ANGOTE
 (City police-constable, No. 218.) I saw the prisoner, on the morning of the 14th, put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out his handkerchief—he dropped it—the prosecutor took it up—I took the prisoner.

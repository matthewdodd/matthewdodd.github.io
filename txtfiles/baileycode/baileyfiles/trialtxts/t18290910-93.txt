            . I was in the skittle-ground of the Two Brewers - I took the prisoner to be a waiter there, and sent him for change for a sovereign - he went to the bar, and then went out.

            , I am a hair-dresser. I saw the prosecutor give the sovereign to the prisoner, to go to the bar for change; he appeared to be a pot-boy there - I believe there were three pots of beer to pay for; the prisoner was taken again in four or five hours.

            . I am a constable of St. Bartholomew the Great, and was called to take the prisoner about nine o'clock in the evening of the 5th of September - he said he knew it was for a sovereign which a gentleman gave him, and he was very much obliged to him - he thought it was for setting up the skittles.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking a good deal, and was rather tipsy; two strangers followed me; and said, "Don't return the change - I dare say he gave it you for setting up the skittles."

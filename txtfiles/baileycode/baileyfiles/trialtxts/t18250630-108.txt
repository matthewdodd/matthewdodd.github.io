            . I am a bricklayer. On the 17th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Peerless-row


, and saw the prisoner bring the child into the row from the City-road, and put his hands up to her neck - she began to cry; he ran away, and I followed him, and cried Stop thief! a man stopped him, and I saw him drop the beads at his heels; he turned round, and struck me, and said,
"I have got nothing now" - I said,
"No, you have dropped it;" I picked them up, and gave them to the officer - he had a bird under his coat.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming towards the City-road, and saw a gentleman, who asked me if I would carry a bundle for him for sixpence; I saw this little girl with the bird, which she said the cat would kill - I asked herto give it to me, and she went and got it for me; I took it, and was going home.

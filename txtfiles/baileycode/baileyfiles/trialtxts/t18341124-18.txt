WILLIAM ELFORD
 and 




HENRY BENSON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
21st of November, one handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



George Hepplewhite, from his person.






GEORGE HEPPLEWHITE
. I am a mariner. On the 21st of November, was in Ratcliff-highway, between, eight and nine o'clock at night—the policeman touched me, and asked if I had lost a handkerchief—he showed me two—the second was mine—I had it in my hand very shortly before.





JOHN NICHOLAS
. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Ratcliff-highway—I saw the prisoner following the prosecutor, who had a lady in his

company—the prisoners were in company, and close together—I watched them some time—they followed the prosecutor—I saw the prosecutor and his lady stop at a fishmonger's shop—I saw Benson take from the prosecutor's pocket this handkerchief, and give it to Elford, who was close to him—they immediately separated, and went different ways—I took Elford into custody with the handkerchief—my brother officer pursued and took Benson—I am quite certain of them—I searched Elford, took one handkerchief from him, and he dropped another.





JAMES PORTCH
. I am a policeman. I was in company with Nicholas—the prisoners were in company together—I saw them following the prosecutor—Benson took the handkerchief and threw it to Elford—they separated—I followed Benson, and about fifty yards on secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Elford's Defence. I had just left my work—I went to Ratcliff-highway to meet a young man there, and was returning home.

Benson's Defence. I had just come from work, and went to have a pint of beer—I was walking along—the policeman seized me.

ELFORD—


GUILTY
. Aged 22.

BENSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.




Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

            . I live in Spital-square. On Wednesday evening last, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was near the India House, I met several persons, and boys going before them with links; I stood aside to avoid the crowd, and was suddenly surrounded by some persons, of whom the prisoner was one - I felt him seizing my seals. He pulled tight, which broke the ribbon - the watch remained behind - he ran away, but I stopped him without losing sight of him; one of the seals and the key were picked up close to his feet. He dodged me round a coach.

            . I was in Leadenhall-street


, at the head of the Coopers' procession. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner trying to get through the crowd. He was stopped by Briggs, who was with me.

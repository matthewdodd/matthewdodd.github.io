ELIZA BRICE. I am a leather-cutter
, and live in York-street, Westminster


. On the 13th of January, about six o'clock, I saw the street - door open, it had been latched before with a spring latch-the shop-door was also open-it is an inner door in the passage; my lodgers go through the passage, and can go out and in. My son brought the prisoner in; I do not know whether the lodgers came in or out after I latched the door - I had been in my room half an hour.
JOHN HYMAS. I am a butcher, and son-in-law to Mrs. Brice. As I was going out of the parlour-door from tea, I saw the shop-door open, and the prisoner rush out; I pursued, and brought him back. He had a quantity of leather - I gave him in charge.

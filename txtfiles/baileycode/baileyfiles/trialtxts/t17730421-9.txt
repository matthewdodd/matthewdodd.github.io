            . I live with the Miss Henley's: they live in James-street, Bedford-row



, they are three maiden sisters: they inhabit a house jointly. On the 3d of April, about six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by Mr. Young, a neighbour, he had observed the house was broke open; I went into the parlour, and found all the drawers open; I found the kitchen window was broke open; the bolt was broke, and the sash was lifted up, I looked at the door, that was not broke, but open: I suppose the person got in at the kitchen window and opened the door over night; in general I am sure every thing was safe. It is not my business, but

                   Thompson
               



            's, to look at the things; but with respect to the watch, I am positive the watch of my mistress was in in the back parlour just before I went to bed over night; the watch was put into a little box where I saw it over night.


                  Mary
                   Thompson
               



            . I am a servant in the family: the door was as I think broke open about six o'clock in the morning; the tea chest and some other things were my property which were in the kitchen; and the hat and cloak were there over night: I saw them there between three and five in the afternoon; they were found missing in the morning; the sash of the kitchen window was broke open, and the staple and bolt were pulled out of the shutter, and the sash was thrown up.


                  John
                   Young
               



            . I am a labourer: passing by the door, at six in the morning, I saw it open; I went to the parlour and found both parlour doors open; and the closet door open, where the plate was kept: I found the kitchen window sash open and thrown up, and the staple broke away: I found a chissel there and a tinder box.


                  James
                   Tindall
               



            . Trainer offered to fell me some silver; Duffey was in his company, and he confessed he had a concern in it; I gave information; in consequence of which Duffey and Trainer were taken up, and the plate found.


                  John
                   Clarke
               



            . Upon the 3d of April, Duffey and Trainer had some plate; Trainer had it but Duffey declared that the plate was his; they were both together, when they were brought before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , Duffey said the plate belonged to him, and Trainer was not concerned in the robbery.

                   Heley
               



            . I searched their lodgings and found these things, producing two connisters, a black sattin hat, and a cap with some lace upon it; I found them in Bolton's room. (They were deposed to by the Miss Henley's)

             brought me these two bed gowns and petticoat (producing them).

                   Taylor
               



            . This black cloak (producing it) was pledged with me in the name of 
               
                  Mary
                   Cole
               



            ; when I came to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, she said her name was 
               
                  Mary
                   Shields
               



            ; it was a black cloak trimmed with squirrel skin. (They were also deposed to by the prosecutrixes).
Balton's Defence.
Duffey and I got up one morning about a quarter before five o'clock as I always did; as we were going to work, going out of Purpool lane, we saw two parcels lay, we kicked something white, which contained the plate, we took it up and carried it to our lodgings. We thought we had a good; I did not know what to do with it; I thought somebody would swear we had stole it, tho' every body knows we follow an honest way to get our bread.
Duffey's Defence.
What Bolton has said is very true. I asked Trainer if he could tell me where I could fell it; he said do you know one Perrot.
Trainer's Defence.
As I was walking with 
               
                  William
                   Linch
               



            , we went into the house of Mr. Lumley in Golden-lane, the Rose and Crown, a house for tossing up. This Perrot was talking to Linch, and he said if I wanted to part with such things, he could help me to a fence; he said that was a man that bought stolen things for I asked what that word meant. Meeting with this Tindall, I told him of it; I came to Perrott, he shewed me a man who offered ten guineas; I told them of it, they refused to take that money; he then offered to shew them another house.

            's Defence.

                  Richard
                   Bolton
               



            : I have had four children by him; he came and asked me to pawn these things for him, which I did.
Shield's Defence.
I live along with 
               
                  John
                   Duffey
               



            . I asked him where he got these things, he said, he had found them; I pawned the cloak for a 5 s. 3 d. that is all I know about it.
For Bolton.


                  Thomas
                   Woollidge
               



            . I have known him between four and five years; he has used my house: he always kept to his business; I never saw any thing but honesty by him.
Q. Has he the character of an honest man?
Woollidge. I never heard any body say otherwise of him in my life.

                   Mills
               



            . I have known Bolton and Duffey two years: they lived directly fronting my house; they were very hard working people; he worked very regularly at a coal merchants, Mr. Quimay in our lane. I have seen them go to bed by nine o'clock every night in my life; I have left

            , a publican
. We live in Prince's-street, Westminster


. The prisoner was quartered on us. We have missed things for the last six months, while he was with us. I did not miss this blanket, but on Saturday the 24th of February Donahoo brought it to me. I know it to be ours; it was on a man's bed in the same room where the prisoner slept.

            . I am servant to Mr. Denham. On the 24th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner in Tothill-street with this blanket, and followed him down to New Tothill-street, then stopped him, and said this is my master's property. He told me to go home, and he would give me 1 s. to say nothing about it. He knew me, I took the blanket home.
GEORGE POPLE, I am a constable. The prosecutor applied to me to apprehend the prisoner. He belongs to the 1st regiment of guards
. I took him in custody that evening, he would say nothing to me, he would not tell me his name.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . On the 25th of January, between the hours of two and three, as I was going through St. Paul's Church Yard


, Mr. Payne asked me if I had lost my handkerchief, I felt in my pocket and missed it; Payne had taken the man: he unbuttoned the slap of his breeches and found my handkerchief; I owned it; the prisoner said he hoped we would not hurt him.

            . On the 25th of January, coming up Cheapside, at Mr. Smith's print shop, I saw the prisoner make several attempts, but he did nothing; he went into St. Paul's Church Yard; Mr. Brooks was looking at some pictures; the prisoner went up and took the handkerchief out of his pocket; I saw him stoop and put it into his breeches; I asked Mr. Brooks if he had lost his handkerchief; he first said no, then he felt and said yes. I examined the flap of the prisoner's breeches, and there I found it; when we came before my Lord Mayor I found three more on him.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

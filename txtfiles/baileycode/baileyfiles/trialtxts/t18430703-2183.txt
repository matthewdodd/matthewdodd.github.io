THOMAS BROWN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 2nd of June, 1 watch, value 1l. 10s.; the goods of 



Ann Hammond; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN HAMMOND
. I am a widow, and live in Temple-place, New-cross, Old Kent-road. On Friday, the 2nd of June, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was in a room at the bottom of my passage, saw the house-door open, and found the prisoner in my back room—the door was shut before, I believe—he must have come in through the shop to the back room—I stepped forward in the passage and took hold of him, as he came through the door—he got from me—I called "Stop thief"—he was pursued, taken, and brought

back—in five or ten minutes I missed my watch—it had been lying in the back room a few minutes before—nobody but the prisoner had been there—it was brought back to me.





CHARLES ETHERINGTON
. I saw the prisoner run down Mason-street, about 150 yards from the prosecutrix's house, and several people hallooing "Stop thief"—when he got opposite our shop, I saw him take his hand out of his pocket, and throw something down—I could not tell what, till I got across the road, into the garden—I there picked up a watch—I brought it back to Mrs. Hammond—a butcher secured him, but an ostler brought him back.





DAVID CLIFT
. I am a policeman. On the 2nd of June I was in the Old Kent-road—I heard of this, went up, and some one said, "There he goes across the field," I ran after the prisoner about half a mile, caught him, and brought him back.

MRS. HAMMOND
re-examined. This is my watch.





WILLIAM BRISTOW
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the boy—I was present at his trial at the Surrey Sessions.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Twelve Years.


Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

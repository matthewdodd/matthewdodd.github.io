PHOEBE HALL. I live at Mr. Winter's On the 2nd of August, the prisoner came to the shop and bought an old pair of stockings and a handkerchief. She came again, but bought nothing; when she was gone I missed a pair of boots and a pair of stockings. She came again next day, looked at some things, I missed a handkerchief before she got out of the shop and asked if she had it, she denied it several times, but at last gave it me from under her gown.

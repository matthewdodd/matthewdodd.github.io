JAMES PIGGOTT
. I am a baker, and live in High-street, Notting-hill. On the 21st of Jan., about five o'clock in the evening, I was sitting with my wife, in the parlour at the back of the shop—I saw a boy running out of the shop—I ran tothe door, and saw the three prisoners taking the money out of my till, which was on the ground—I cannot say how much there was in the till—there was a shilling—I ran after the prisoners and overtook them—I first caught two, and then the other—I am quite sure they are the boys.





MARY ANN PIGGOTT
. There were 12s. in the till, in shillings, sixpence, and pence—I followed my husband, and saw the three prisoners—they had the till in their hands—Whittle held it, and they all had their hands in it.

Collins. The lady said she had taken the money from the till three minutes before. Witness. No, I said I had taken some money from the till.





WILLIAM PALMER
. I searched the prisoners, and found some silver and copper on Collins.





ROBERT DUNNETT
 ( police-constable F 198.) I was on duty, and was called to take the prisoners—I found no money on them.

Callins's Defence. I was full fifty yards off; the gentleman beckoned, and I came to him. The money I had belonged to my father.

            . I was going to Shadwell, with a load of hay, and asked the prisoner the way; my young master was with me - we had unloaded our hay, and were coming home, when the prisoner took my coat out of the cart; a boy told me of it. The officer pursued and took him.

            . I am servant to Mr. Hart, of Shadwell. I saw the prisoner take the coat out of the cart, and run across the fields. I told the officer, and he pursued, and took. I am sure he is the man.

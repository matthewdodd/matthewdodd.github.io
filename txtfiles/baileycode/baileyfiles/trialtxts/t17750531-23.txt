            . I am servant to Mr. Flower. On the 23d of May, the prisoner came to see me while the family were at dinner; I brought down the things, and the prisoner dined with me. I put the things away, and put the pepper-box on the shelf, and the spoon in a dresser drawer. I had leave of my mistress to go to the play that night; while I was gone, my mistress missed the pepper-box, and the next day she asked where it was; then I missed it. It was found upon the prisoner by Mr. Jealous.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for upon the 23d of May, to Mr. Flower's, in St. Martin's lane, there I found the prisoner in custody; they stopped her as she was going by. I took her to the Brown Bear in Bow-Street, and found the pepper-box under her cloak. She told me she had sold the spoon to a Jew, that has not been found. She confessed it freely.
The pepper-box was produced in court, and deposed to by Davies.

Mrs. Flower said, if I would confess she would forgive me.

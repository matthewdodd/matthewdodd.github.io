            . I live at St. John's Wood


. I had three linnets hanging in cages at the end of the Barracks


. On the 2d of February, at one o'clock, my granddaughter came and said something - I went in pursuit towards Portland-town, and saw the prisoner by a cow-yard,about a quarter of a mile off, with two of the birds and cages. I found a little boy, who got away with the other. They were safe at half-past twelve o'clock. I let him go, as he said he would not go with me without an officer, and fetched one, who took him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . On Friday last, I was going through Whitechapel


, on the Plaistow stage; I felt a little twitch at my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner dropping from the coach, with my handkerchief; I called to the man to stop, and jumped down - the prisoner turned down Great Garden-street, and ran down several streets; I pursued, and took him - I only lost sight of him as he turned the corner; he had dropped the handkerchief - I brought him back, and some person had picked up the handkerchief, in the line which he had run; from the observation I had of him at the back of the coach, I should be doubtful of his person, but I scarcely lost sight of him till I took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I produce the handkerchief. Two men brought the prisoner to the watch-house; the prosecutor said, in his presence, that he never lost sight of him from the time he dropped from the coach, with the handkerchief in his hand.

             re-examined. It was not above a minute or two before I took him; he was walking then - I had run him out of breath; I should not have the smallest hesitation in saying he is the person.

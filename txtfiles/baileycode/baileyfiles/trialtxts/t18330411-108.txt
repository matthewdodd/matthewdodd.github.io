            . I am a Policeman. On the 1st of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the corner of White Hart-court, Lombard-street


, with another, following a gentleman up Lombard-street, and watched them; the other attempted to take the gentleman's handkerchief first - he took a handkerchief part of the way out of the gentleman's pocket, but did not get it quite out; then the prisoner took it quite out, and ran across the road with it - I went after him and secured him; I looked every where for the gentleman, and could not find him - I do not know his name or residence; I found the handkerchief on him - it is the same colour as that taken from the gentleman; he said it had been given to him - his companion went in a contrary direction.
The prisoner put in a petition for a lenient sentence.

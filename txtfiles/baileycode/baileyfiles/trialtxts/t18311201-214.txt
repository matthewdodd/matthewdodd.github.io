            . I am a town-traveller
, and live in Salter-street, Cannon-street-road. On the 25th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was about half-way down Fleet-street


, on the pavement, and felt my handkerchief go from my coat pocket; I put my hand down, turned round immediately, and saw it laying on the ground, and the prisoner in the officer's hands - I had used it as I came through Temple-bar.

            . I am a street-keeper. I watched the prisoner for some time, going up and down Fleet-street, with another; they followed another gentleman, who went into Serjeant's-inn - they then followed Mr. Manger; I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Manger's pocket, and draw the handkerchief out - I took hold of the end of it in his hand, as he was handing it over to his companion; part of it went on the ground - his companion ran away; I should know him again - he was there ready to receive it; I did not see Mr. Manger at the moment, but I called out; he turned round, and claimed the handkerchief - the other was a youth, stouter and taller than himself; the prisoner said he had no parents, and did it for want - he had no money.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, the other boy took it out, and chucked it on my shoulder.

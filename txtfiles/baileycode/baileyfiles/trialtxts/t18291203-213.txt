            . I am a cheesemonger
. I lost a tub and some butter in it, about eight o'clock at night, on the 2nd of December, from a show-board inside my shop, in Charlton-street, Somers'-town


 - I had seen it about two minutes before I went out; I was out about an hour, and when I returned it was gone.
WILLIAM WHITTINGHAM. I saw the prisoner and a companion of his, standing near the prosecutor's door - his companion took the tub off the board, and the prisoner received it from him - he crossed the street, and I followed him; I saw no one come up - I went and askedwhere he got it - he said he had just picked it up in a field: I said that was wrong, collared him, and took him to a public-house - he said he was sorry for it, and that distress made him do it; I took him to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)

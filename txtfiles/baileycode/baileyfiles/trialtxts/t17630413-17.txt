Philip Bellie. The prisoner had been 2 months in my service, I took him out of charity being almost naked; he went away, after which I missed my silver buckles. I taxed him with taking them, he owned he had, and that he had sold them.

            . I am a silversmith. I bought these buckles of the prisoner at the bar, (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor) they do not weigh two ounces, iron chapes and all, I gave him 8 s. for them.

The night before I did this thing I was drunk. I brought down my master's shoes, and cleaned them, but where I put the buckles I do not know, or whether I put them in the shoes. I did not find them till three days after in my pocket, then I sold them.

SARAH ASKINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of January, 6 sovereigns, the monies of 



John Sanders, from his person; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN SANDERS
. I am living at the Castle-tavern, in Portugal-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. About eleven o'clock, on the evening of the 20th of January, I met the prisoner—she asked me to give her a drop of gin—I said I did not mind—I went into a public-house, and called for a quartern of gin—she called in another young woman—I paid 1s. for it—I had six sovereigns and 8d. left—when I came out the prisoner called me on one side, up a passage, and said she wanted to speak to me—I asked what she wanted—while she was speaking, I saw her hand go to my pocket, and I saw hex hand something to the other young woman—I missed the six sovereigns—I gave her in charge—I have never seen them since—I am sure she is the person who put her hand into my pocket.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. You were sober? A. Yes, I had only been paid at five o'clock—I had had a pint or two of beer—I did not go far up the passage—the other woman came, and passed her hand over my shoulder, and the prisoner passed her hand to hers.





JAMES LAMBERT
 (City police-constable, No. 511.) I took the prisoner, she said she did not know any thing of it.





WILLIAM CONNOR
 (City police-constable, No. 647.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

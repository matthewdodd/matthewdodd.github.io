MARK RAWLINSON
., I am a carman, living in Shoe-lane. About a

quarter to five o'clock, in the evening of the 1st of December, I left my cart—I had a leather housing on my horse—in consequence of what a boy told me, I ran after the prisoner, and saw him running with the housing under his arm—he dropped it—I picked it up—he was stopped—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner. I was coming through Neville's-court, another man met me, asked what I wanted—this man came up with the leather in his hand, and said I stole it—I said, "I will wait till the policeman comes," which I did for five minutes. Witness. There was another man with him, who ran away, but the prisoner is the man who dropped this—the other man was on before me—the prisoner was on before him.





GEORGE CANNON
. I saw the prisoner running up Neville's-court, and after he turned the corner, he dropped it—I am sure he is the man who dropped it.

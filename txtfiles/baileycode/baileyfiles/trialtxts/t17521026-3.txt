John Noble. I am a bookseller
, and live in St. Martin's Court


. He produced four books. I lost these out of my shop at divers times; the prisoner was my servant
 at the time. I found the books at the shop of Mr. Huson, in Maiden Lane; who told me he had them of one 
               
                  Ann 
                  Brown 
               



            , now in court. I took up the prisoner, and he confessed he stole them from me, and also 22 others.

                  Huson 
               



            . I am a bookseller at the Cicero's Head. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Brown 
               



             brought these books to me Aug. 29. She had brought some others the 24th, and I gave her twenty shillings and sixpence for the whole; she said she was employed to sell them for an honest man. After the prisoner was taken up, I heard him confess before Mr. Noble all the books were Mr. Noble's property, before the justice.

                  Brown 
               



            . I had all the books which I sold to Mr. Huson, of the prisoner at the bar. He said they were his own; but when they were found out, he said they were his master, Mr. Noble's books.
Prisoner.
She knows I stole them from my master.

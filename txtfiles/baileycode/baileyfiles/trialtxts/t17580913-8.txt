.* 
Abraham Baker. I live in Haunch of Venison Yard, Lower Brook-street


, and keep post-chaises and saddle-horses to let out
. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment; they were in the chest locked up. (He names them over with the value of each.) I went out and left them in my room seven weeks ago last Wednesday, and when I returned at about 11 o'clock at night, they were taken away.
Q. What is the prisoner?
Baker. I gave him liberty to lie a night or two in my hay-loft, he being a poor fellow. He was missing when the chest was. He was found with one of my coats and two waistcoats on his back: on the Friday following, he owned to the taking all the things; and also told us where he had sold the other things, we went, and found them accordingly.

            . The prisoner at the bar sold me this frock, and a pair of breeches, and a pair of buckles, (producing them, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I gave him 13 s. and 6 d. for the frock and breeches.
Prisoner. He gave me but a 9 s. piece.

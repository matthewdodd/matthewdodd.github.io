ISAAC HOLBIRD. I am a shoemaker
, and live in Beech-street


. On the 2d of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to my shop to purchase some children's boots - she went into the back shop, close to where these boots and shoes hung; I showed her several pairs, but none suited her - she said she would bring a pattern, and have a pair made by Saturday; as she was going out she looked very bulky - I asked her what she had under her shawl - she said nothing; I felt her, and these boots and shoes fell from her shawl; there are three pairs of each children's boots and shoes; they are worth 8s. or 10s. - I sent for a constable.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you made inquiry about her? A. Yes, and find she has four children, and is pregnant - I cannot say that she was in distress.

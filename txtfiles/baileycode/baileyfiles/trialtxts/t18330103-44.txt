; my father is a porter. I have known the prisoner some years - he came to me some time before this happened, and said he was in great distress: I took him in from charity, and he lived with my father and 1 for a fortnight; I missed the articles stated on the 3rd of December, from my bed-room - the prisoner did not go to bed that night; he said he was so cold he could not sleep - I went to bed, and in the morning I missed the articles, and the prisoner was gone.

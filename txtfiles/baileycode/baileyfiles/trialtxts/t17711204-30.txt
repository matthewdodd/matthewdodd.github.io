            . I watch for Messrs. Power's on the keys; they are merchants

; they had some barrels and jars upon the keys; they were put by themselves, and were all marked with a red P. and they had a rush case over the jar; the prisoner came up to me on the 7th of November, between five and six o'clock, and asked me if I should be there at night; I told him yes; I desired to know why he asked me that; he said I have something to come on there, and if you don't take notice I will tip you something: I turned away upon this, and I saw the prisoner take a jar from off the pile and set it by the landwaiter's box; then I saw him take the jar on board a ship; I jumped on board and seized him by the collar whilst he had the jar in his hand; he offered me a crown to let him go. The jar had Mr. Powers mark on it.

                  Waite 
               



            . At the time the fire was at Wapping, on the 22d of June, I saw the prisoner at our house; Mrs. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waite 
               



             is my mother; the prisoner had no business there at all: I bid her go out, and forewarned her from taking any thing with her: the fire began about 11 at night: we were told the next morning, that the prisoner had been offering things to pledge; the fire was on a Saturday, and we took her upon the Monday following. I heard her acknowledge she took a parcel of things in a sheet, and pitched them in the alley, and after that got assistance to carry them to her house: upon taxing her, she took the officer and I to Rag-fair, to a house where she had offered the quilt to sale, and they stop'd it: she asked for it, and the people produced it: she had pawned a pair of sheets at one Jones's, in Old Gravel-lane, for five shillings: he at first denied having them, but when he found we should search, he produced them. (The quilt and streets produced and deposed to.)

            . I am servant to Mrs. Waite: the quilt and sheets are the property of my mistress. I did not see the prisoner at our house, at the time of the fire, to my knowledge.
Prisoner. They have changed the sheets.
Job Jones. I am a pawnbroker; I have known the prisoner almost twenty years; I never heard a dishonest thing of her before this. She brought me a pair of sheets on the 24th of June, in the morning: when the officer came for the sheets, they carried them to the bench of Justices, at Whitechapel: neither the maid nor the master could find any marks on them: these have a mark, they are not the same.

                  Waite 
               



            . After the fire we did not know where to find things to supply the beds; and we made use of the sheets; I do imagine these are no t the same; I believe the others were finer than these: the prisoner said she pawned them to this man for five shillings, and he owns he lent her five shillings on them.
Q. to Jones. What did you do with the sheets the prisoner pledged with you?
Jones. I delivered them to Mr. Knight, the officer, and Mr. Waite.


                  Jane 
                  Ross 
               



            . I do imagine the other sheets were finer than these; we having a deal of company, made use of them; and I believe these are not the same.


                  Edward 
                  Knight 
               



            . I had a search-warrant delivered to me by Mr. Waite, and another, to take the prisoner: when I took her in custody, I could get no hearing that night; I said, if she would sit quiet, she should stay in my house till 11 o'clock, I keeping a public-house: after she had been at my house about two hours, I desired her to tell the truth; she desired Mrs. Waite might be sent for; she came: the prisoner said she would inform her where the things were; after which I went home with her to her own house; in searching there, we found the pillows and pillow-cases, and some towels; and she told us there was a pair of sheets she had pawned at Mr. Jones's, for five shillings: I went to Mr. Jones's, and there they were found; he said he lent her five shillings on them: when we came back again the prisoner owned she had taken a sattin quilt to Rag-fair, and it was stopt. I went, by her directions, and was told the prisoner brought it there on the Sunday morning, and asked two shillings for it: they, suspecting her, stop'd it: they delivered it; here it is.
Prisoner's Defence.
The maid met me on the threshold of the door, and put the things on my head, and bid me carry them to my house, and take care of them: I kept them there some time.
Q. to Ross. Did you deliver the things to the prisoner?
J. Ross. No, I did not; I tied up the things, but directed every body to carry what I delivered to Mr. Arnold's.

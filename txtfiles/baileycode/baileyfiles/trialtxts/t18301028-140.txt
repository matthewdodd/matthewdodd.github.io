            . I live opposite Mr. Purssord. On the 18th of October I saw the prisoner lurking about his shop - Mr. Purssord was talking to me; I turned my back, went into my parlour, and took a glass of ale - I then missed the prisoner from the prosecutor's window, and I saw Mr. Purssord's boy standing in the street; he seemed confused - I ran down a street towards Red Lion-square; I there found the prisoner, and took him back - he struck me a violent blow, and said it was put there for a trap.

            . I stopped the prisoner with this ham.
ROBERT PURSSORD. I have no doubt this is my ham, but I cannot exactly swear to it - a lad is here who saw him take it.

            . I saw the prisoner stoop, take the ham from the window, and walk away - I gave the alarm.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had found the ham on the pavement in Theobald's-road.

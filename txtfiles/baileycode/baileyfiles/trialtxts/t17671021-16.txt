            . I live in Smith's court, Bridgewater's-gardens


; my wife lett the prisoner a lodging room ready furnished; he had been there eight weeks last Thursday, then we missed the two sheets from his bed; I could never get any rent of him, so I desired him to go out; I enquired after the sheets; the prisoner's daughter told us that he had taken and pawned them, and the pawnbroker swore that the prisoner brought them.

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live in Golden-lane, the prisoner pledged one of these sheets to me the 14th of October, and the other the 15th (produced and deposed to by prosecutor's wife.)
Prisoner's defence.
I had some goods of theirs, and some of my own; my daughter was along with me, she said she could get some money for me; that she would go and get her mother's sheets and pawn them; she took them to the pawnbroker's door, and I took and carried them in, and pawned them; she said she would fetch them out again, and her mother should never know.

. - The prisoner lodged in the same room with me - he was a perfect stranger. I was employed in the East India warehouse. I went out in the morning, and left these things in the room. He never returned; but was apprehended with my shirt on, about three weeks ago.

He was running very fast, I took him; she charged him with the robbery; he denied all knowledge of it. I found a shirt on his back, which the prosecutor claimed - he gave me the name of

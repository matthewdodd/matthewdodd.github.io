1098. 




JAMES EVANS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Francis Duffield, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






FRANCIS DUFFIELD
. I am assistant to an ironmonger. On the 1st of May, I was in Crown-court, Seething-lane, and had my handkerchief extracted from my pocket—I received a violent push behind—I turned and saw my handkerchief on the ground, and the policeman struggling with the prisoner—this is it.





CHARLES BURGESS
 (City police-constable No. 54.) I saw the prisoner, with two others, following a mob of sweeps, and trying several pockets—I followed them to this Court—I then saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Duffield, and one who has escaped drew Mr. Duffield's handkerchief half out of his pocket—the prisoner then took hold of it and drew it quite out—I seized them both.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Seething-lane, and a young man who was alongside of me committed this robbery; I was collared; I said, "If you want me, I will go with you quietly;" he tore my shirt and waistcoat all to pieces; I turned and resisted, and so did the other prisoner; I said I would not go with him without he showed his authority; the other man got away; the prosecutor cried shame, and said I was treated in a barbarous manner, and so did the neighbours; the policeman drew me three or four yards before I began to resist; it is hard for me to suffer for what I am not guilty of.

COURT
to
FRANCIS DUFFIELD. Q. Did you cry "Shame!" and say he was treated in a barbarous manner? A. I did not—he was not treated barbarously to my recollection.





PIERCE DRISCOLL
 (police-constable H 24.) I produce a certificate of the prisouer's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—"Convicted 5th Feb., 1844, and confined Three Months")—the prisoner is the person.





GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

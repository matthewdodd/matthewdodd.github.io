            . On the 24th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I met Maxwell in Whitechapel,and went with her to her lodgings, in Wentworth-street


. Smith followed us in, and asked for something to drink? I gave her some money to fetch some porter, and in about three minutes she came into the room without any. Maxwell directly snatched my pocket-book out of my side-pocket, containing five 1 l. Bank notes. I caught hold of her, and Smith put out the light while she escaped. I then secured Smith, but the watchman would not take her, as it was not in his beat, so I let her go. I gave information at the watch-house, and Maxwell was brought in, in about two hours. I am certain of their persons.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Were you drunk - A. Not the least. I am gamekeeper to Sir Wellesley Pole.

            . I am a headborough. Prince came to the watch-house, and described Maxwell. I found her about one o'clock, in Whitechapel. I told her to pull off her stockings as I was searching her, and as she pulled them off, I took two 1 l. notes from her hand, they had been concealed in her stocking.

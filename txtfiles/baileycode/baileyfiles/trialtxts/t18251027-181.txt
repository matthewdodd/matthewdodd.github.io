            . I am shopman to Mr. Joseph Rumbell, linen-draper
 of Leicester-square


. The two prisoners came to the shop on the 11th of October, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon - I shewed them some shawls - they objected to the patterns - I left them to go to the window to fetch some more, which they each looked at, but still objected to the patterns, and wished to leave half-a-crown, and fetch a friend of theirs to decide on the pattern - from this circumstance I suspected them, and opened the cloak of the prisoner Ann, and found under her arm-pit a shawl - I looked at the mark, and found it to be one I had previously shewn them, and the other prisoner wept bitterly, and offered to pay the value.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not the elder prisoner plenty of money? A. She seemed to have three or four pounds.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners - they were searched by the watch-house-keeper's wife, who said, in their presence, that she found 1 l. 5 s. on the younger prisoner, and, I think, 3 l. 8 s. on the other.

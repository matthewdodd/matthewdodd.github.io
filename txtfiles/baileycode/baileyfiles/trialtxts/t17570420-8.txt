            . I never saw the prisoner in my life till after he was taken up. On the 22d of February betwixt six and seven in the evening I lost a copper stewpan. The day following I went about to the pawnbrokers shops, to see if I could find it. On the Thursday morning Mrs. Rochfort said she had got it. I saw it; it appear'd to be mine.
Q. What is the value of it ?
Isaac. It is worth about 6 s.

            . I took a stewpan in pawn of the prisoner at the bar. I asked him if it was his own. He said it was, and that it cost him 17 s. 6 d.
Q. What did he pawn it for?
A. Rochfort. For five shillings. He said my boy knew him. I turn'd to the boy, and asked him if he did. He said he did, and that he was a customer of ours; it is the same stewpan that the prosecutor own'd.
Q. What is the value of it?
A. Rochfort. I believe it is worth more than the prosecutor has mention'd; it is quite a large stewpan.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had it of another man, who sent me to pawn it;

JAMES MORLAND
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of July, 1 breast-pin, value 5l.; the goods of 



James Letts, from his person.







JAMES LETTS
. I live in Clement's-street, Lymington. I was living in Frederick-street, Hampstead-road—about eleven o'clock at night on the 12th of July I was in St. John-street—there was a crowd and a fire—the prisoner was before me—he took the breast-pin from my shirt—I collared him—I saw the glimpse of the pin in his hand—he had caught my chin as he drew it from my bosom—he passed it with his left hand to some one behind—I never unloosed him.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. The crowd was very dense? A. Not very—I had some trouble to get through—I did not stop to look at the fire—I was not in sight of the fire—the prisoner made way for me to pass—I did not push against him—there were no others trying to get through—the; were standing still—he was standing beside me—it was very light from the gas—I had not been drinking—it was just as I got up to the crowd that the snatch was made at my pin—I was not aware of any crush at the time—I am not certain whether it was passed to a man, or fell on the ground; but he stooped—I was holding the prisoner by the collar with my left hand, and trying to catch the other with my right—the prisoner resisted—I believe he said, "Let me go, and I will walk with you"—this is my hand-writing—( looking at his deposition—(read)—"I attempted to seize the prisoner's left hand, which had my pin, but some person behind seized my arm—I seized the person who had stooped, but he broke from me")—I might have caught hold of the person's coat—I did not seize him by the collar, nor move two or three yards from the place where I first was.
(Ann Fordham, wife of William Fordham, of Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY.† Aged 25.—

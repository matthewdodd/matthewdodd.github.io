            . The prisoner and I both work'd for one master. I missed the tools mentioned in the indictment, on the 22d of October. I took the prisoner up, and charged him with taking them: he own'd he had, and had sold them to Mr. Howard, where they were found. [The tools produced and deposed to.]

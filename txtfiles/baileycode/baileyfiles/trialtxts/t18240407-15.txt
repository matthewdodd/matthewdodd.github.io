            . I have been a merchant
. On the 24th of February, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was in Cheapside


 with my brother - a person called out, and asked if I missed anything; I felt, and missed my handkerchief from my coat pocket. The person laid hold of the prisoner, quite close to me, with it in his hand, and charged him with picking my pocket; he said nothing.

            . I am a milkman; my walk is in Holborn. I was in Cheapside, and saw Mr. Isaacs and two more gentleman walking arm in arm - the prisoner and another boy were walking close behind them. I watched them all down Cheapside, and just by Gutter-lane, I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of Mr. Isaacs's pocket. I laid hold of his hand with the handkerchief in it, and called to Mr. Isaacs.

            . The prisoners came to my shop on the 23d of January; they had been there once before; after they were gone I missed some ribbon. I sent my maid after them, and they were brought back to my shop. Presently I missed my watch from the place where it hung; we searched the prisoners; and at last we found the watch concealed in a hole in the lining of

"The constable, who was present when the watch was found, confirmed this evidence."
"Smith said in her defence, that she was innocent, and was a servant to

            . The prisoner came to my shop on the 20th of January, and bought three yards of ribbon. Soon after they were gone, I missed a piece of blue ribbon, and a piece of rose-colloured pink. On the 23d they came again, and asked if I had any more of the same ribbon that they bought before. I told them I had not: Then Davis asked for some black ribbon; I pulled out a drawer, and shewed her some; the drawer was of the inside the counter, and opened towards me; presently after, Smith threw a long red cloak over a drawer that was in the window. I suspected she had took something; and when they were gone, I missed some ribbon. I sent my servant, 
               
                  Emelia
                   Cary
               



            , after them, and bid her tell them that I had found some of the ribbon that they had asked for. She came back, and told me, that they said they would call another time; I sent her after them again, and the maid got assistance, and brought them back. They went into the parlour; Davis wanted to go into another room, but I would not let her. When Davis got up she left two pieces of ribbon belonging to me in the chair she had sat in.
Q. from Davis. Was there not a black cloak in the chair?
Howard. Yes; but the ribbon was upon the cloak. I sent for a constable, and I delivered the prisoners into his custody.
Davis. There was a woman in the room; it is very likely she left the ribbon in the chair.
Howard. There was not any body in the room till after the ribbon was found.

            . The prosecutor's servant deposed, that when she went after the prisoners to bring them back to the shop, they refused to come back with her, and Smith threatened to stone her, but that a gentleman came to her assistance, that while she was gone for a constable, the ribbon was found."

"The prisoners in their defence said, they were quite innocent of the charge."
Both

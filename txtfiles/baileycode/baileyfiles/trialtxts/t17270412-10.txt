             depos'd. That finding his House broke open, and knowing the Prisoners (his next Door Neighbours) to be a Parcel of idle People, he search'd their House on Suspicion, and found the empty Cask, the Beef, and some of his Brandy, afterwards he found the Gowns on the Persons of Elizabeth and Sarah Green, going to pawn them at the Hole in the Wall in Leicester-street.

             the Constable, all depos'd. That they was present when the Goods was taken on the Prisoners.
Robert Green thus made his Defence, I was going to work at 5 in the Morning (this lookt a little too industrious on an Easter Monday) and at my own Door kick'd against a great Bundle, which I took up and carried into my Room, where I found them to be the Goods mentioned in the Indictment. (N B. wearing Apparel, Beef and Brandy, a very odd Composition for a Bundle to be made up withal) now I being honest, said he, call'd up Crispin, Elizabeth, and Sarah Green, (for we all lay in a Room together) to contrive how the right Owners might come by their Goods again; at length we agreed, having no Money, to pawn them, that we might have wherewithal to pay the Cryer, and Whilst we was going to prosecute this honest Intention, we was all taken into Custody; but notwithstanding this fine Pretence, they could not justify a bad Action, which was too evident for the Jury to be impos'd on: But the Women being under the Power and Influence of their Husbands, was 

               acquitted
            . Robert and Crispin found 


               guilty of Felony, but not of the Burglary, to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

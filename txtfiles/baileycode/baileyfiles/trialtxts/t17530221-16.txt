             and I. and brought in a bundle in a brownish bag, and said he had found it in Newgate-Market, and that it was linnen; he opened it, and there were silk stockings and some pieces of silk.
Q. Did you believe he found them?
E. Moor. I believed he did not.
Q. Do you believe now he did not?
E. Moor. I believe he found them; he said if we would go and sell them he'd give us all above a shilling a pair that we sold, so we took four pair and pawned one pair in Bride-lane for 2 s. 6 d. I don't know the man's name; then we went upon Snow Hill to pawn a pair, and the pawnbroker asked 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clark 
               



             where she got them; she said her mother gave them her, and that they were her wedding stockings; he stopped them. From thence we went into Field-lane, to Mrs. Ridge, and she bought the other two pair for three shillings; we asked her half a crown a pair; I never knew her before, she trades in women's cloaths. Then we went to Mrs. Pearce who lives two or three doors from the other, and asked her if she would buy any silk stockings, and she desired to see them, so we went to our room and fetched 4 pair, which she bought of us at 2 s. a pair; we asked her three; as we went out of her shop Mrs. Ridge called us to her, and asked us if we had any more stockings to sell, and said if we would bring them she would buy them; so we went with some, and she was to give us a shilling a pair; then we went and fetched more; we carried at the last time 14 pair; in the whole we carried 40 pair; she paid us 6 s. and was to give us 32 or 13 s. more. She bid us come o n the next Sunday, so we did and she said us 3 s. then she bid us come the next Sunday, we went, and she, paid us 5 s. we bought two handkerchiefs of her, which in the whole came to 7 s. 6 d. we went to Mrs. Pearce's the same day that we carried the 40 pair to the other; we wanted to know if she would buy any more, and she said we might bring them down that she might look at them, so we carried 20 pair, and she said she did not know what to do with them. We desired her to lend us 20 s. upon them, which she did, and desired we'd fetch them away as soon as we could; we told her we would as soon as we found any body that would give us more. We sold Mrs. Ridge two pieces of long silk, about a yard long, for 1 s. 6 d. and two pieces to Mrs. Pearce .

            , to go and sell them; I said they should not, and put him out of the house; then I went to work My wife told me that he came again after that, and the other prisoners went and sold them, but I saw nothing of it. The prisoner (Haws) lodges in the house I do.
Q. from Haws. Did I go out of the house that morning ?
Moor. He did.

            . I bought these pair of stockings of the boy at the bar for a shilling .

             . On the first of this month there came a parcel up by the Towcester waggon, which unloads every Thursday morning about four or five o'clock in Newgate-Market; the bag was in the bill of lading, and the bag was missing after it was unloaded, it was directed to Mr. John Hookham in liread street . After I had an answer to a letter that I sent into the country about it, I advertised it 3 guineas reward twice, and at another time 10. The first information I had was from one Mr. Price, who had stopped one pair of them. The boy was taken up, and I was present when he owned that he took this bag of stockings from under the waggon, and he said there was a bag of halfpence which he could not carry, or he had taken them (there was a bag at that time with 3 l. 10 s. in halfpence in it) he said he carried it to the house of Moor, and opened them, and burned two pocket books that he took out of the parcel, and had an apron made of the cloth they were in. I saw that.

                  Hookham 
               



            . I have several workmen that make stockings for me in Northamptonshire. I received a letter from John Shepherd of Hertford to let me know he had sent me 71 pair of silk hose . and four pieces of silk for breeches by the Towcester waggon, which never came to hand. On the 6th of February I saw an advertisement from Mr. Price on Snow hill, of a pair of silk hose that he had stopped; I went there, and saw a pair of crimson silk stockings that he had stopped, and said they were brought to his house by 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clark 
               



            , and they appeared to be mine. On the 13th of Feb. there was an advertisement of two pair that had been stopped at Mr. Brown's on Snow-hill. I went and found them to be two pair that came from two of my workmen that I had the general account of, (for these in the parcel were from several workmen) which I know by the clocks and colour. I have seen of them 42 in one parcel, and 24 in another, besides this pair which

                  Newel 
               



             produced.
Q. What is the value of the whole?
Hookham . They are worth 46 l. there are different prices to there .
Q. What are the best worth a pair ?
Hookham . They are worth 15 s. a pair .
Q. What is the lowest value ?
Hookham . None under 9 s. a pair .
Q. Do you mean the real value, or the selling price?
Hookham. I mean the real value. I heard Haws say the apron he had on was made of the outside wrapper or bag; and I heard Mary Ridge own she had lodged some stockings in a place in Shoemaker Row, and that they were carried away from thence to a place in Bishopsgate street. The whole that were found upon her, and by her directions, were 42 pair, and two pieces of silk for breeches .

                  Ridge 
               



             brought a parcel of stockings to my house . and asked me to let her leave them there, I think it was on Saturday last was 7 nights, but don't know how many there were in the bundle. After that, I was necessitated for a little money, so I opened them and took two pair out, thinking I might make free with them as they were in my house, so I carried them to pawn for 10 s. This was on the Monday after she brought them; I carried them upon Snow-hill to a pawnbroker, but don't know the man's name. They told me there were some stockings advertised, and they suspected them to be stolen ; then I told them my name and place of abode, and went home without the stockings ; then I went to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ridge 
               



             and told her I had been to pawn two pair, and they were stopped on Snow-hill, and I seared they were stolen, so said they should be no longer in my house; she followed me home, and said she had seen the persons whom she had bought them of, and told them of these two pair stopped, and about their being advertised; that they laughed at her; and said they were not the stockings that were advertised; she took them away.
Q. When she first brought them, did she give any reason why she desired they might be left there ?
C. Taylor. She said there were some stockings advertised, and she did not know whether they were them. I answered, then she had better carry them to the principal owner and get the reward; the answered, there were but three guineas reward, and that money was not sufficient to destay what she had given for them, so she would not carry them home, as they were advertised supposed to be dropped.

            . I live with Mr. Brown on Snow-hill, he is a pawnbroker. Catharine Taylor brought two pair of silk stockings to me to pawn on the 12th of this instant; I asked her how she came by them ; she said she bought them for her husband's and her own use in Chick Lane last summer, and that she gave 16 s. a pair for them ; I asked her where she lived; she said in Field Lane, and kept a cloaths shop ; I told her there had been some stockings advertised, and it was not improbable but these might be part of them, but I would look into the advertisement and send for the persons, and if they were not part of them, then she should have them safe again; she seemed to be in a great hurry to be gone, and said she had left her shop alone, so she went away and came no more. Then I advertised them (the stockings produced in court) I found she lived where she said, and I directed the prosecutor to her.
Q. What is the value of them ?
A. Masters. They are worth about 14 or 15 s. per pair.

            . I am constable, and received these two pair of stockings of Mr. Harrison, the pawnbroker's servant. After that, I received 40 pair more of Mrs. Horrocks in Dunnings Alley, Bishopsgate street, who said in my hearing, before my lord mayor, that 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ridge 
               



             brought them to her house herself. I went to Guildhall with

                  Pearce 
               



            , who said just before we came there, if I'd go along with her she would take me to the place where the stockings were, so I and one Brebrook went with her to a stone-cutter's shop in Shoe-lane, his name is Pratt, and she brought me out 24 pair and two pieces for breeches.

            . I am servant to Mr. Price on Snow-hill, and received one pair of stockings of the evidence (

                  Moor 
               



            ) and the prisoner (Clark) on the first of Feb. I asked Moor whose they were, and she said they were her own, she wanted to borrow half a crown on them, she said her mother gave them her, and that she lived at Puddle Dock . Moor said I need not be afraid of taking them in, for they were Clark's wedding-stockings; I then asked Clark if she had ever wore them, and she said she had, but seeing they had neither been wore nor pressed, stopped them till she brought somebody to testify they were her property, but she not coming I advertised them ; then the prosecutor came and owned them.
Haws's Defence.
I found the stockings in the street, one end of which comes out into Newgate-street and the other upon Ludgate hill.
Clark's Defence.
Haws brought them to

            's house, He lodged there ; she asked me to go with her to sell them, so I did, and we pawned a pair, and at another house we had a pair stopped. Haws told us what we made above a shilling a pair we should have.
Ridge's Defence.
On the first of this month

            , came into my shop and asked me if I wanted to buy any stockings; they brought two pair and asked 8 s. a pair; he told me he was the maker and was distressed and wanted a little money, so I bid him 6 s. a pair, and he took my money and away they went; they came again on the Sunday morning following and desired I would lend them a little money upon some more, but I said it was not a proper time to bring them, and I would not . At last I lent them 10 s. upon 20 pair of them . They came a little time after and desired. I would lend them 10 s. more on 20 pair more, which I did. I had bought a handkerchief which appeared afterwards to have been stolen, so seeing the stockings advertised, was afraid of trouble, therefore I carried the stockings to Mrs. Taylor's house.

            . I saw the prisoner pick the gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief on Wednesday last at the bottom of Leadenhall-street, before it was dusk, and put it into his bosom. He was going close behind the prosecutor, and I was in my master's shop on the other side of the way. The Prisoner went up an alley, where he was stopp'd and brought back; he had dropp'd the handkerchief in the alley, which was taken up by some of the people, and produc'd in court.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing at all of the matter.

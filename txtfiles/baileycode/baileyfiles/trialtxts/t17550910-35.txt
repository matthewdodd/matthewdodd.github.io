            . Last Thursday night, betwixt seven and eight o'clock, I was coming down Holborn; between St. Andrew's church


 and the Fleet-market


, I had my handkerchief in my hand, I put it in my pocket, and in about two minutes I felt a hand at my pocket, I put my hand down and took hold of the prisoner's hand, with my handkerchief in it. Then came up two men, one gave me a shove, and the prisoner got away; he was pursued and taken; he said he had not the handkerchief, one of the two men had it. I took him before the sitting alderman, and he was committed. I never saw my handkerchief after I saw it in his hand.

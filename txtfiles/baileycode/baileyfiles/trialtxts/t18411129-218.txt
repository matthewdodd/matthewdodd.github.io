HENRY M'CAVE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of November, 1 pair of trowsers, value 7s., the goods of 



Moses Samuels; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MOSES SAMUELS
. I live in Strutton-ground, Westminster. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 15th of November, I was in my shop, serving a customer—I turned, and saw the prisoner running away—I ran after him, and took these trowsers from his arms—they are mine.

Prisoner. I was not running. Witness.—You were running, and making the best of your way.

Prisoner. Q. How were they fastened? A. On a nail, and tied up with a string, which was broken.





ABRAHAM VINCENT
 (police-constable B 85.) I took the prisoner, and have the trowsers.

Prisoners Defence. I wished to purchase a pair, he stated that I tore them down from his door; he took them out of my hand, he said I was so drunk he could make nothing of me, and after that he said I gave him impudence, and was going to slap his face; I looked at the trowsers—he took them down, and chucked them on the counter; he followed me half-way up the street with a policeman—the prosecutor had not the trowsers with him when I was taken.





ABRAHAM VINCENT

re-examined. I took him about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house—the prosecutor had not the trowsers with him—he threw them back into the shop, and ran to stop the prisoner—he made

no representation that he wanted to buy them, till he got to the station, and there he stated he wanted to buy them—he had 1 1/2 d. on him.
(Witness for the Defence.)
—M'CAVE. I am the prisoner's father—he asked me to buy him some trowsers—I said, "Go in and look at them, I will come and pay for them"—he went in.





ABRAHAM WRIGHT
 (police-constable B 99.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)— the prisoner is the person; and he had been convicted before that.

THOMAS SPARROW
. I live in King John-court, Shoreditch, and am a cab driver, I set down a fare at Charing-cross, on the 16th of April, at a quarter past six o'clock, I had a great-coat and horse-cloth, I tucked them in the dickey, and drove into the Temple rank, and staid there, I then missed my coat and horse-cloth, these are them.

Prisoner. They were not put in safely, they hung off—I was running behind the cab and they fell off—I took them up, and called to the cab-man—I turned, and was going to give them to the first policeman, but some gentleman came and said I had stolen them, I put them down and ran away, and he gave them to the policeman—I picked them up, but not with any felonious intent.

. I live in Paternoster-row. I was walking that evening in the Strand, opposite Milford-land—I saw a cab coming up, with the driver in it, and a man running behind—I watched, and saw him put his hand up, and take the coat and cloth—he stood for a second or two, and then ran; I followed, and gained upon himhe then threw the coat down and ran on with the cloth—I stopped him—he then doubled round, and ran from me, and then ran into two policemen's arms, who took him, as I hallooed out "Stop him."





SAMUEL GARDNER

            . The prisoner worked in the country with us, at Martin in Surrey: I live in London. I had notice brought me last Sunday, in the evening, that there was a person with a piece of printed linen, twenty-two yards; that the marks at both ends were cut off, and that the man worked with us, and had acknowledged it to be ours; he was in the watch-house, by Ratcliff-Highway: a printer who had seen it, and knew it was not finished, came and informed me of it. I went the next morning; the prisoner acknowledged he took it from our yard, (produced in court,) about twelve o'clock at night: it is our pattern, we don't know of any body that has got the same: the pieces are always marked at each end. There is the draper's mark, the king's stamp, the progressive number, and the workman's mark that prints it; these are torn off.

            . I live in the New-Road, near Wellclose-square: on Sunday last, about two or three o'clock, the prisoner went by, with this cloth under his coat; he asked me if I would buy it: I said, let me look at it. I sent for a headborough, and took him in custody, and put him in the watch-house, and on the Monday morning he was taken before the justice; there he confessed from where he took it: there was twenty-two yards and a half of it.

This is the first time; I have a great family of children.

WILLIAM COLLINS
 and 




THOMAS DIGGER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
15th of November, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Joseph Rice, from his person.






JOSEPH RICE
. I live in Cannon-street. On the evening of the 15th of November I was in Oxford-street, opposite Sowerby and Williams's—I stopped with a friend a minute or two—I had my handkerchief in my pocket just before—I missed it at that time—this is it.





JOSEPH LEATHART
. I live in Bath-place, Bayswater. About six o'clock this Tuesday evening I was in Oxford-street, and saw the two prisoners together following a gentleman, and at a hoard I saw them put their hands into a gentleman's pocket—I then went on after them—they went on to Regent-street—I watched there some time, but came away, and then went to Mr. Rice, in Oxford-street—there Collins put his hand into his pocket, but did not get any thing out—they then followed him on to Sowerby's, and there they got close together, and I saw they had got something out—I took them both, and Collins dropped the handkerchief, the other got away—I pursued Digger down Berwick-street and he threw down another handkerchief—I took it up, and then followed and took him—I brought him back to the prosecutor.

Collins. I never saw Regent-street that night, nor the handkerchief.

Digger. I was with him, but did not know that he had taken this handkerchief, and then I ran off—the witness came after me, and in going back he took it up in a door-way.

Witness. No—it was in running after him.





CHRISTOPHER WIDDENBURN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners, and have the handkerchief.

Collins. I am innocent of the crime.

Digger. I was with him, but did not know he took the handkerchief.

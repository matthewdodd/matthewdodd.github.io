. I live at Stepney. I missed a truck on the 15th of March—the prisoner came on the evening of that day, and said he had borrowed the truck, and left it with a person at Vauxhall, because he was too late to get his load of bottles that he went for, but he would return it the next morning by nine, or half-past nine o'clock, but he did not come—I saw the truck again at the Thames police-office, on the 28th of April.

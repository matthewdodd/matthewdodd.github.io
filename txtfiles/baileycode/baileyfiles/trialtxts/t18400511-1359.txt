JOHN BURNETT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of April, 1 jacket, value 5s. the goods of 



James M'Burney, in a vessel in a port of entry and discharge; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES M'BURNEY
 I am a seaman on board the Grace Darting. On the 28th of April, she was in the Regent's Canal dock—my jacket was safe that morning—I missed it in the evening—this is it—(examining one.)





WILLIAM SHEEN
. I was on board the vessel on this day—the prisoner was there—I saw him pull his own jacket off put another one on, and put his own outside the gate—I think the jacket he put on was a blue one—I told the coal-heavers of it directly—they did not go after him—he was drunk at the time—he staggered very much, and was very near falling into the barge from the ship's side.





ELLEN COLEMAN
. On the 28th of April, I was in High-street, Shadwell, sitting outside the Pavior's Arms public-house, and saw the prisoner—Mary Brown came and spoke to me—in consequence of what she said

I went to the prisoner—he had a jacket on his back—he gave it to Brown, who gave it to me, and asked me to go and pawn it—he said he gave 14s. for it—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did he give it to Brown in your presence? A. Yes, I went to pawn it—Brown went with me to the pawnshop door, and asked me to go in, as I might get more money than she.





EDWARD CHILD
. I produce the jacket, which was pawned by Coleman on the 28th of April.





CHARLES EDWARD
 (police-constable K 271.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of him since then? A. No.

Alex Carless. I saw the Prisoner take down a large sauce pan, and put it under her petticoat, while the maid went down to draw a pint of beer. When she came up, I asked her whether the Prisoner belonged to the house, and she said she did not. I said she had a sauce-pan under her petticoat, and the maid took it away from her.
Doborah Baker. I took my master's sauce-pan from under the prisoner's petticoat.

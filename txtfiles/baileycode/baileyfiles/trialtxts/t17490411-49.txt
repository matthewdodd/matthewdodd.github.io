. We left the prisoner in our house while we went to see the fire works in the Green park; she had been my servant nine days. We missed the things as soon as we came home that night; she was gone and the cupboard was broke open. She was found two days after at Barnet . I advertised the things, and the pawnbroker brought me some that were pawn'd; there were two spoons and a milk pot pawned for 36 s. she sold my watch for 30 s. and told me where. she was taken by two men; they had gone with her to pawn the milk pot and spoons, so were afraid of being brought into a bad case. She confest all but the 36 shillings piece, and said, she knew she should be hanged.

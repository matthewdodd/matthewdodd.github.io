WILLIAM GRANT
. I live in Evelyn-street, Pimlico. On the 20th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, a person came into my shop, and gave me some information—I had before that had this roll of flannel in my shop inside the door-way, and two pieces of goods were in front of it—I then missed the flannel, and went out—the policeman found it in a yard at the back of a house where the prisoner was found—this is mine—(looking at it.)





JOHN LEGG
.(police-constable B 155.) On the evening of the 20th of July I saw the prisoner and another running over the wooden bridge at Pimlico—the prisoner had this roll of flannel—I followed, but lost sight of them—I found they were gone into a house in St. George's-place—I went there, and found this flannel in a hedge in the garden at the back of the house, close by where I saw the prisoner stand.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man who said he was going on an errand, and asked me to go with him—I saw two men, one of whom I knew, and he asked me to go across the bridge with him—the other man gave him the flannel—he and I went on together, and when we got to a place he said it was not a thoroughfare—we went to his father's—the flannel was not in the yard when I went there, it must Have been thrown out of the window.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

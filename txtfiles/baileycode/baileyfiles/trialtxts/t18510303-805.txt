CHARLES COLLINS



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the property of 



William Bucknell Lemon, from his person: having been before convicted.






WILLIAM BUCKNELL LEMON
. I live in Penton-terrace, Kennington-road. Last Saturday evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I was coming from the Walworth-road towards Newington Church—I felt a pressure behind me—I turned, and there were three young men, and the prisoner, who was one of them, had his hand in my pocket—he could hardly extricate it, before I struck him on the head with my stick—he had this handkerchief, which is mine, in his hand; he took it with him about four or five yards—he then dropped it—I took it up, and pursued him round the corner, when I collared him, and kept him till the policeman came—I am sure he is the man—I left the other two behind when I ran after the prisoner—I saw them as I was coming from the station—they asked if I had given him in charge—I made no reply.





JOHN THOROGOOD
 (policeman, P 180.) I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.





WILLIAM BUDD
 (policeman, L 49.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Newington—(read—Convicted March, 1850; and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.

                  , from his person
            .
WILLIAM GUTTER. I am a carpenter
, and live in Charlotte-street, Old-street. On the 6th of January, about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Long-lane


, and felt a person's hand in my outside coat pocket; this induced me to turn round, and I found the prisoner at my pocket; he had my handkerchief out - I laid hold of him, close by me; he never got from me; there were three others in his company. I saw him give my handkerchief to one of them.
Q. Should you know either of them? A. Yes - I am quite certain I should; it was a silk handkerchief, and worth 2s. 6d.; his companions went off; he was never out of my sight, till I gave him in charge of the watchman - I saw the handkerchief in his hand - I had used it two minutes before - I am certain his hand was in my pocket.

            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre- I was going my rounds, when Gutter gave the prisoner into my charge.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Long-lane, and crossing to Smithfield, a gentleman crossed, and said,"You have got my handkerchief" - I said I had not.

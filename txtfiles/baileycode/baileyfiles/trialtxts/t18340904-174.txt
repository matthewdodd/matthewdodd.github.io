ANN LEMON. I am a monthly nurse

 - I lost some things from my trunk - the sheets were between the bed and the sacking, and the trunk under the bed - the prisoner lodged in the house for about six months.

            . I am a policeman. I received information of the robbery, and went to the prisoner's lodging in Salisbury-street


 - I said, "You are charged with stealing a sheet, some linen, and other articles: I shall take you to the station-house" - she said, "I am quite innocent, I will go with you" - I took her to the station-house - I received this shift, which I took to Mrs. Lemon - it was found on her person.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. She lived at a different place to the prosecutrix? A. Yes; at that time, about a quarter of a mile off.
ANN LEMON re-examined. I am certain that is my shift.
Cross-examined. Q. The shift was in a trunk - I cannot exactly say when it was safe - I have only one more like this - I had seen it about three weeks before, and all my things safe - my father takes care of my room when I am out to nurse - he is frequently out, and he is childish - he is eighty-two years old.

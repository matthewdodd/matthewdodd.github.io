 - the prisoner had been eight or nine months in my employ. On the 7th of May, about four o'clock, I gave him five sovereigns to go and get changed - he never returned; I saw him locked up the next morning in a station-house - he gave no account of my money then, but afterwards said he had bought some new clothes with it; he had new clothes on.

            . I keep the London Apprentice. A young man, whom I have every reason to believe was the prisoner, came and had a glass of something to drink, and asked to leave a bundle, which he said contained some old clothes, and he would call for it in a short time.

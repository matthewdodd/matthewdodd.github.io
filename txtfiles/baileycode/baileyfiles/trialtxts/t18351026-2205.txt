JOHN D'OYLE
. I live in Trafalgar-place. I was crossing Oxford-street on the 9th of October—there was a crowd, and I felt my handkerchief go from my pocket—I turned round and saw it in the prisoner's hand, and saw him put it into his pocket—he ran off, I followed him—he threw it down, and was stopped in my presence, and given to the policeman.





JOSEPH CLEMENT
. I am a policeman. I was in Oxford-street, and heard a cry of "Stop him"—the prisoner was running, and the prosecutor after him—a young man came up, and gave me the handkerchief.


Prisoner's Defence. Another boy chucked it down and saw me, and said it was me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

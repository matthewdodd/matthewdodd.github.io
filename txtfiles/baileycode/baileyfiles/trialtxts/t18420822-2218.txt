JOHN TAYLOR
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of July, 1 box, value 1s.; and 15lbs. weight of tea, value 5l.; the goods of 



Joseph Bulkeley Johnson and others; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







JOSEPH BULKELEY JOHNSON
. I am a tea-dealer, and live in Nicholas-lane. I have more than one partner—this box of tea is mine.





THOMAS KNIGHT
. I am porter to the prosecutors. At a quarter-past two o'clock on the 5th of July I was returning from dinner,—on coming in at the door I saw the prisoner coming out at the door with the box of tea under his arm—I said, "Where are you going with that?"—he made no answer, but dropped his arm, sprang off the steps, and ran off about a hundred yards—he was caught by two men—I never lost sight of him—this is the box of tea.

Prisoner's Defence. I and another lad were sky-larking; he knocked my hat off, and threw it into the warehouse; I went to get it, and knocked down the tea-chest; I took it up, and was going to put it in its place, when this man was coming in, and I was stopped on the steps. Witness. We do not keep the chests of tea at the door—it was about eleven feet inside the shop—I saw no other man there.





WILLIAM BUTCHER
 (City police-constable, No. 540.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

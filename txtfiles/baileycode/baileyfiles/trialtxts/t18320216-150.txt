JOHN WRIGHT. I am an officer, and took him.
Prisoner's Defence. There were several people passing- some of them must have seen it; I was three yards from him when he turned, and said, "I have got you;" I said,"What for?" he said, "You dropped this handkerchief"- I said, "If I did, give me into custody;" he took me into a grocer's-shop - I waited half an hour before the officer took me.
MR. JONES. I am quite clear that I saw the handkerchief in his possession, and he was the nearest person to me.

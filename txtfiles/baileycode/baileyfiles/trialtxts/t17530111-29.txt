            . The prisoner was a labourer
, and worked for me from the third of December. I am a gardener
, and had a horse of

                  Mumford 
               



             to make use of. The prisoner having robbed me of some pottatoes, I went to ask one Mr. Scarlet who had bought them about the affair. The man asked me if I ever lost a horse; I said this horse of Mumford's was missing, he was broken-winded and sway backed. That man bid me enquire of

            , the Southampton waggoner, so I went and met him about the 12th of December, and he told me he had sold this horse as I have described to one 
               
                  Timothy

            . The prisoner came to my house some time in September, I can't be positive of the day, and called to refresh himself, with two children and a horse; he said he bought the horse of his master for seven shillings to help carry the children into the country.
Q. Did you know the horse before?
Scarlet. I never saw him before to my knowledge.

                  Day 
               



            . I met the prisoner at Belfound, he had got an old horse, he said he was going to Winchester with his two children, and that he bought him of his master, but money running short he would be glad of me to help him, and desired that I would dispose of the horse for him; I did not think the horse was dishonestly come by, So I sold the horse for 15 shillings to one Mr. Gates, at Egham, and gave the prisoner the money; it was such a horse as Mr. Thompson has described.

            , and John Holeman, came to my house and asked me, if I had a tall black man worked with me, I said I had (naming the prisoner); they asked me whether I had sent him to sell any pottatoes or onions; the next day came two another men to tell me the prisoner had sold some more at Hammersmith. At this time the prisoner was at the King's-Head at Fulham, where I live ; I sent these two men there, and desired them, if they saw him there, to lay hold on him, and I'd get a constable; I went and got one, and charged him with the prisoner, and took him to justice Beaver at Hammersmith ; there were three men who came and brought me part of my goods, which I know to be mine, they are of the Spanish kind; there the prisoner did not deny taking them, but said his dame sent him to sell them. The justice ordered me to send for my wife, who came, and he was committed.

            . The prisoner came to me on the Wednesday night before he was taken with some white Spanish onions, and I bought six-pence of him; he left the remainder of them in a my landlord's till the next night, when he said had fetch them. I had some suspicion, and was to tell the prisoner my mind, and ask him  his master sent him, which I did when he came and he answered, if his master had not sent him, how could he come by the mare which he brought them on? he took the onions away that he left; then I and my landlord went to the prosecutor's house on the Sunday morning, and told him the affair, I was with him before the justice, where he said his Mistress sent him to sell them.
Q. Did you carry any of the onions to the justice's which you bought?
Goddard. I did not, but my landlord did three or four of them, which he had bought of the prisoner.


                  John 
                  Holeman 
               



            . I bought a sack of potatoes of the prisoner at the bar about a month before he was taken, and also half a bushel of onions, I carried three or four of the onions to the justice's when the prosecutor and prisoner were there, and the prisoner there said his mistress sent him to sell them.
Q. What did you give him for them?
Holeman. I gave him three shillings for the onions and one for the potatoes; the prosecutor said before the justice the onions were his property.


                  John 
                  Nash 
               



            . The prisoner brought a sack of potatoes to Mr. Holeman's house upon his master's mare, about a week before he was taken, he brought them into the house and shot them down. My master bought half a hundred, and I bought six penny worth of potatoes. I heard him say his mistress sent him with them before the justice.
Mary Thompson. I am wife to the prosecutor. I never sent the prisoner out with potatoes or onions in my life to sell. My husband is a very infirm man, so lame that he is obliged to sit in his chair for days together ; I go to market and sell the goods, all goes through my hands ; I have no need to send goods out privately to sell for me.
Prisoner's defence.
My mistress sent me to sell these goods for her, being short of money; I have put goods in the boat for her several times unknown to my master.
Prosecutor. My wife is the only person to go to market, all goes through her hands. I am a lame man, and have been for years.

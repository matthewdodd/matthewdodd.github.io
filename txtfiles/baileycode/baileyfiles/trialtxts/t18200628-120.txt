            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner on the morning of the 6th of June, at three o'clock, with the copper on his head, in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital. He said he brought it from Hampstead, and was taking it to his mother's, who is a washerwoman, and lives in Bird-street. I asked what number; he said,
"Ask no questions."

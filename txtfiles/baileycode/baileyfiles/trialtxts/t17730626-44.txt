, in Wood-street, Cheapside


, in the silk ribbon manufactory


. On Thursday morning last I saw the loom stripped of thirteen or fourteen yards of ribbon; I delivered the materials a fortnight before to 
               
                  John
                   Reynoldson

                   Reynoldson
               



            . A fortnight ago my master delivered the materials to make ribbons to me; I delivered it to be made to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Mathews
               



            ; nobody makes it but her in my shop.

            . I worked at the loom from whence it was taken; they were delivered to me by Mr. Reynoldson; I make that ribbon in his shop. I went out at a quarter after eight last Wednesday evening; my husband came home with me; I heard a noise over my head; the weights of the loom fell; I suspected something; I went up stairs; my husband catched the prisoner on the stairs. When I went up I found the silk out of the harness; it was picked up by 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Herbert
               



             in the two pair of stairs room; ( the ribbon produced); this was the ribbon made by me up in that shop; I had made none of that sort: when I went out I locked the door; I was not out above five minutes. The last person that goes out of the shop takes the key up to Herbert up two pair of stairs.
- Mathews. I heard a lumber in the shop over head a little after eight; I went up to the stairs foot and called out, who is there? no answer was given; I got half way up stairs and called again; there was no answer, then I ran up to the top of the one pair of stairs, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop; I laid hold of him; the prisoner wanted to fling me down stairs; he said he did not want any thing but Mr. Davis if he lived there. I did not see him cut the ribbon but it looked as if it had been cut.

            . I saw the ribbon upon the stairs; the prisoner took a knife out and wanted to slide it on the stairs; I picked it up on the landing place of the two pair of stairs; I heard a person run up the stairs half an hour before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the ribbon. I was catched up three pair of stairs.
He called two witnesses who spoke but slightly as to his character.

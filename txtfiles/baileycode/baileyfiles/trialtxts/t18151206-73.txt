            . I am a carrier from Eltham and Lee to London
. My cart was robbed in West-street, Smithfield


, on the 2nd of November, about half past two. I took the box in question up at the Pewter Platter, in Gracechurch-street, at a little after one o'clock, and was to have conveyed it to Shooters Hill; it was addressed for "Colonel Coolbrook, of the Royal Artillery."

            . I am an assistant to my father, who is a milkman. I was in West-street, on the 2nd of November, at about half past two. I saw a man get up into Mr. Mill's cart, and take out a box. The prisoner stood at the other side of the way. I was looking at him; he crossed the way, and gave the box to the prisoner, and said, come along, follow me. Then I went, and told Mr. Mills, and Mills went after the prisoner, and collared him, and the other man who had taken it ran away.

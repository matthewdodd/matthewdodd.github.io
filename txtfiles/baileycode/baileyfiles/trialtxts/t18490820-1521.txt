THOMAS READ



, stealing 1 watch, value 10l.; the goods of 



William Bradbury, from his person.






WILLIAM BRADBURY
. I was at the races at Harefield, on 7th Aug. A short distance from the winning-post the prisoner stood by my side—I felt a tug at my watch—I put my hand down instantly, and it was gone—the prisoner was rushing away; I rushed after him, and seized him—he struggled, and dragged me into the middle of the racecourse—I kept him till the officer came—my watch was found where we had struggled—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILDE. Q. What are you? A. Butler to Mr. Charles Mills—the prisoner was standing on my right-hand side, partly in front of me, with a great coat on his arm—my watch was in my right-hand pocket—the horses were not running at the time; they had just come in—there was nobody else near enough to have taken the watch.





JAMES DUFFIN
. I found the watch close by where the scuffle was.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Mr. Bradbury? A. Yes; after I picked up the watch—there were many persons at the winning-post—my wife was there; she saw the watch first, but I picked it up—I did not tell the Magistrate so.




GUILTY
.* Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years.

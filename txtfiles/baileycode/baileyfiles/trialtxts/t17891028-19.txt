I am a hay sale's-man
: I live in Smithfield


: on the 31st of July, I and the constable were in the hay-loft, about two in the morning, I saw the two prisoners go out of the lost with two trusses of hay: Mr. Holmes sprung his rattle, and they dropped the hay; it was quite day light: I reached rather too far, by which means I fell, and hurt myself very much.

. On the night of the 24th of June, I was sitting in my parlour, and saw the prisoner come down stairs, and go out at the door; I ran down Hosier-lane after him; my boy was with me - I left him to pursue, and I went back. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house, and the linen was brought to me directly; it is mine: it had been part in the club-room, and part in the kitchen.

            . I am the waiter. I pursued the prisoner, and cried Stop thief! he struck at me with an umbrella, and then fell down. I did not lose sight of him till he was secured; this bundle was found in his hat; he dropped the sheet in Hosier-lane: it had been wrapped round his body.

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner running down Hosier-lane, and then into Foxenall-court - when I came up he was endeavouring to unbuttonhis trowsers - I found some linen in his trowsers; I did not search his hat.

Prisoner's Defence. I was quite insensible - I was not even able to tell my name, or where I lived; all I was able to say, was,
"Give me a drink of water."

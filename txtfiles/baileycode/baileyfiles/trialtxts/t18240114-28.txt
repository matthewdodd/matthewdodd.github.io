            . I am a hatter
, and live in Long-lane


. Last Monday, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, I was behind the counter, this hat was on a stand inside the door; I did not see it taken, but was alarmed, and ran out, and saw the prisoner twenty yards off with it; he turned into Charterhouse-street; I saw him drop the hat there; he was secured there. I knew him before by sight.

            . I live near Staples. I heard a cry of Stop thief; saw two boys running, and the prisoner with the hat - I followed - he threw it down, and I picked it up. I am sure of him.

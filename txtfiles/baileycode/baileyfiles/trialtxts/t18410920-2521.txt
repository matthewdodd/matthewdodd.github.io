JAMES TIDMARSH
 (police-constable M 51.) On the 5th of September, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Union-street, Borough, and saw the two prisoners in company—I watched them, and saw Sculthorp take a piece of pork from inside the shop-window of Mr. James Ware, and give it to Sheffield—I followed him, took it out of his bosom, and took him—Mr. Ware would not attend—I waited on him next morning, to ask his name—he is the owner of the shop—I saw the port in his shop, and saw the prisoner take it.





WILLIAM PARNELL
 (police-constable M 128.) I have a certificate of the conviction of the prisoner Sculthorp, by the name of Robert Green—(read)—he was tried at Newington—I know he is the man.

I am a cooper, I was going to my work in the Steel-yard, I saw the prisoner at the bar about the iron, I watched and saw him come out with a piece of iron under his coat; I told Stubley the watchman of it, we pursued and took the iron from him, this was about half an hour after 2 in the night; we took him before my Lord Mayor, and he was committed. (The even produced in court; deposed to by Mr. Greenwood on the prosecutor's property; that it was Russia iron, called new fable, taken from a quantity of such married in the like manner.)

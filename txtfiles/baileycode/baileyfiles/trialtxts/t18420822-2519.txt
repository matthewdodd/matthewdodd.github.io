 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of August, 1 pair of trousers, value 1s. 6d.; 1 shirt, value 1s; 1 cap, value 6d.; 2 handkerchiefs, value 2s.; and 7 shillings; the property of 



Frederick Cooper; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






FREDERICK COOPER
. I live in Steven-street, Bethnal-green-road. I went to bathe on the 18th of August, and left my trousers and money on the shore—when I came out all my things were gone—when I went into the water the prisoner was lying on a bar, which parted the field from the little path—a boy detected him, and took my clothes from him as I war running up the side of the canal naked—these are my clothes—I lost seven shillings, and 6s. 101/2d. was found on him—this handkerchief, which if mine, was returned with the clothes—they were taken by a boy not here.





WILLIAM CATLIN
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—I ran after him—I saw him drop this handkerchief—I picked it up, and gave it to the officer.





WILLIAM FRENCH
 (police-constable N 151.) I took the prisoner—I found 101/2d. in his right hand.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I went in pursuit of the prisoner—we caught him at Cambridge Heath-bridge—I laid hold of one hand, and my brother officer the other—in the lining of the waist of his trowsers I found six shillings—as we were going to search him, he said, "You have no occasion to search me, I will give it up," and he did.





WILLIAM EDWARD BALL
 (police-constable N 365.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

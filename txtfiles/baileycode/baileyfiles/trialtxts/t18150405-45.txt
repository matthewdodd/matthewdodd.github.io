            . I live at St. Thomas Apostle. On the 22nd of February, I was between Gracechurch-street and Fenchurch-street


; I lost my pocket book; I felt the pocket book go from me; I felt a twitch at my pocket; the prisoner was behind me; I looked round, and saw the prisoner crossing the road, and seeing him watching me and my friend that was with me. I suspected him, that he was the person that had taking my pocket book from me; I ran, and took hold of him; he threw the pocket book away from him, from under his coat; my friend picked the pocket book up, and delivered it to me; it contained a note for twenty pounds, and eighteen pounds. This is the pocket book; it is mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I throw myself on the mercy of the court.
JOSEPH DAY. I saw the prisoner drop the pocket book when Mr. Green laid hold of him.

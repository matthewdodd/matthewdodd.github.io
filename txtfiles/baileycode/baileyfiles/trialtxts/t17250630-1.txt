            , on the 5th of May
 last.
Francis Gill thus deposed: I am a Shoomaker
, the Prisoner was my Apprentice
, and having found him, several times guilty of Pilfering, I would have turn'd him away; but his father giving me a Bond for his Honesty, I consented to try him a little longer. But on the 5th of May last, between five and six in the Morning, he ran away; and I soon after found my Drawers broke open, and mist the Money, and his Father's Bond. The Prisoner was taken about two Weeks after, with two green Purses, and 38 s. in his Pocket, which he confess'd were my Purses, and Part of my Money; and that he burnt his Father's Bond.

 - on the 5th of February, the prisoner came and asked for a lodging - he went up to bed, and when he came down the next morning, he said he would go and be shaved - we then missed the sheet - I went out, and saw the prisoner coming back towards the house - he asked for a little bag which he had left behind him, containing thirty-six duplicates - I then said, "You have taken my sheet" - he said, "I have not;" but I found it round him.

            . I am an officer of the Thames-police - the prosecutor came to the office, and claimed the jacket which was on the prisoner's back.(The prisoner read a long statement of various hardships which he had endured at sea, and stating that the jacket was his own property.)

            . I said there was a piece of tape to it, partly torn, which there is; and, on the starboard side, there were four buttons uncovered, and so there is - at the time he took my clothes, I had only 3d. in the world to get me a mouthful of victuals, and I grudged him that more than anything else.

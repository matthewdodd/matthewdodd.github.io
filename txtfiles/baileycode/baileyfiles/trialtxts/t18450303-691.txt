. I live in Edmund-place, Aldersgate-street, and am a medical student. On the 24th of Feb., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Smithfield-bars with Mr. Barnes—I saw the prisoner take a yellow silk handkerchief from his pocket—I tapped the prisoner on the shoulder—he ran away—I followed him—he threw down the handkerchief and was stopped—I never lost sight of him—I am sure he is the person.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see my band in his pocket? A. No.

                   SUMMERSET
               



             sworn.
I am a linen-draper
; the prisoner was my shopman
 from the 23d of January to the 12th of March, when I lost my property: before I discharged him, I sent for an officer to search his box, and we found therein the things mentioned in the indictment; the box was in a garret in my house; the prisoner was present at the search; he made no resistance, or excuse, to my recollection; the things have my shop-mark on them; I am clear they are mine.

             sworn.
I am the officer; I searched his box; the key was in it; he opened it directly, and the things in the indictment were found.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I have been in business for myself, in Glamorganshire, and I kept a few things by me, and these were part of them; Mr. Summerset frequently sent goods into the country, and these might have been brought there with his mark on them.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Lord KENYON.

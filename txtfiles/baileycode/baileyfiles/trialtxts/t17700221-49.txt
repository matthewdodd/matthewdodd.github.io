            . On Saturday the 3 d instant the things laid in the indictment were taken out of my lodging. The prisoner and her husband lodged in the same house. I got a warrant, and searched her lodging. She had taken a pair of sleeves off one of my shifts, and had them on. I found a night-cap and apron of mine in her room. I asked her after the rest of my things. She owned she had taken and pawned them; and directed me to the several pawnbrokers, where I found them. (Produced by three pawnbrokers, and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
She has strove all in her power to part me and my husband. She desired me to pawn them, and now wants to swear my life away.

            . I am a gas-fitter, and live at No. 43, Clement's-lane. On the 8th of September, about five o'clock, I was near Chatham-place, Blackfriars


 - I saw Smith across the road, take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, who was looking through the balustrades, at a rowing-match; Dixon was standing behind him - I went to go over, but a cart came by; I could not go straight across - I pursued, and took the prisoners: I could not get at the gentleman, there was such a crowd; two other persons joined the prisoners about twenty yards off; I followed them all till I saw Perry - he took the prisoners down to Bridewell, and found the handkerchief on Smith.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners, and found this handkerchief on Smith.
Dixon's Defence. I was not in Smith's company - I never saw him; I was talking to two persons - Smith came up and asked me to buy a handkerchief; I said No - he then asked another person.
Smith's Defence. I picked up the handkerchief, and asked several gentlemen if it was theirs; they said No - I then asked Dixon to buy it, and the officer came and took me.

WILLIAM RICHARD MORRIS. I was in Fleet-street


 on the evening of the 7th of April - I felt a pull at my pocket, turned round, and a gentleman had the prisoner and the handkerchief in his hand, and charged him with taking it- he denied it; I had been walking arm-in-arm with a friend - this is my handkerchief.

            . I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from that gentleman's pocket; I took hold of him.
Prisoner. Q. Were there not several persons about? A. There were two of his companions behind him, and he was close behind the prosecutor; I detained him, and took him to the watch-house.

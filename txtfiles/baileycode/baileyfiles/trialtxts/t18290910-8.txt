            . I am in the East India service, and live in Burton-crescent. On the 1st of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Fenchurch-street


; a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I had not lost my handkerchief; I felt, and it was gone - I had not selt it after I left home at ten o'clock; a gentleman pointed out the prisoner, who had just crossed the street; I went over, laid hold of him, and he dropped my handkerchief from 
under his coat - I saw it fall from him, and picked it up; I took him to the street-keeper, and delivered it to Martin at the Mansion-house; he said at the watch-house that he took it, and asked me to forgive him, saying it was his first offence.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any body present when he said that? A. No; the constable had gone out at the door - I saw it drop from his coat on the payement.

            . The handkerchief was delivered to me at the Mansion-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking in Fenchurch-street- this gentleman and another came across; the gentleman said I had his property - he found it close at my feet.

1766. 




WILLIAM SIBLEY
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of June, 1 duck, value 2s., the property of 



Benjamin Dodson Gale.






ANN DODSON GALE
. I am the wife of Benjamin Dodson Gale, of Hillingdon. We had a brood of seven young ducks, which I saw safe last Monday, the 10th of June, between four and five o'clock, in a stream near our house—I missed one about five o'clock—I saw the prisoner coming along, past where the ducks were, to go over the bridge, with something under his white flannel jacket—I saw him put something up under his jacket as he went, and I missed the duck in five minutes—it was a white one—Pain was with him.





HENRY WATERMAN
. I was about a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Gale's—I saw Sibley and the boy Pain in Mr. Page's field, about a quarter of a

mile from the prosecutor's, about half-past five o'clock—I know where the ducks were kept—if a person came from there it would lead to the spot where they were—they were sitting down, with their legs down in the ditch—I told the policeman where I had seen them sitting under the ditch or hedge.





WILLIAM SERVANT
. I am a policeman of Uxbridge. I received information from Waterman of where he had seen the prisoner sitting with Pain—I went to the spot with Mrs. Gale, and found a quantity of white feathers—the blood was not chilled in the quills.

MRS. GALE (re-examined.) These are young duck's feathers, such as mine were.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to the water to wash myself, and put my clean shirt on—I had my dirty shirt under my jacket.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

First Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

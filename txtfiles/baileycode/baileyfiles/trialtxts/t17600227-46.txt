; I missed a silver spoon the 15th of this instant, about two o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner had been at our house that day. There was the name upon it, 
               
                  William 
                  Biddle 
               



            , Black-Beat, Piccadilly, the man's name that kept the house before I came.
Mr. Pinner. I am journeyman to Mr. Capriell, silver-smith, in New-Street, Covent-Garden; the prisoner came yesterday morning about ten o'clock and asked me if I would buy an old spoon; I saw the name on it, and ask'd her whose it was; she said it did not signify whole it was, so I stop'd her and the spoon too. Then she own'd she was guilty of taking it and hoped I would forgive her.
Prisoner. I have done a fault and am sorry for it.

ELIZABETH JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of November, 9 1/2 yards of printed cotton, value 5s., the goods of 



Edward Jenkins; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY GIBBS
. I live with Edward Jenkins in New Church-street, Marylebone. About eleven o'clock on the 30th of November I heard something snatched down—there was some printed cotton hanging inside the door—I went round to the door and saw the prisoner standing there—as soon as I went to the door she left it—I missed one piece of cotton from the place—I followed the prisoner, brought her back, and took this print from her.





THOMAS HASELDINE
 (police-constable D 104.) I took the prisoner, and have the cotton.





THOMAS HARRISON
 (police-sergeant D. 14.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the same person—and she had been before convicted of felony.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

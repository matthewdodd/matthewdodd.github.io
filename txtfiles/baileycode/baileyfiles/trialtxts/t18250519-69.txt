SAMUEL WATTS. I live in High Holborn, and am warehouseman to a grocer
 in the city. On the 8th of May, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening. I was on Holborn-hill


, by Ely-place - I had used my handkerchief on Holborn-hill; I felt it going from my pocket, turned round, and seized the prisoner, with it in his hand; he dropped it instantly; I picked it up and took him to the watch-house.
Prisoner. Q. Is it marked? A. No - I am certain it is mine.

            . I received him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. Two lads were before me - the gentleman made a sudden stop and accused me of this; it is my handkerchief; he did not know whether it was marked or not - a lady, who was with him, said some of his handkerchiefs were marked in the middle.

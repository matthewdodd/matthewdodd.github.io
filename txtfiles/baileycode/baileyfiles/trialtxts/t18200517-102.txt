            . I am an oilman
, and live in Little Earl-street, Seven Dials


; the prisoner had been my porter
 for three months. On Saturday, the 13th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, he came in to be paid, I observed his coat looked bulky, took a piece of soap out, and found about a pound between his jacket and waistcoat. I sent for a constable, who took him to the watch-house; he immediately took off his hat, and there was two pounds and a half in it; I then went to his lodgings, and there found two pounds and a half more of the same soap - it had only come in at four o'clock that day. I also found nine pounds of yellow soap. He begged for mercy.
Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. He bought it of you - A. The week before he bought three pounds and a half. He had no family, and did not take in washing. This was a particular sort, and only came in that day.

            . I am a constable. I found the soap in the prisoner's hat, and some more at his lodgings. He said it was his first offence.

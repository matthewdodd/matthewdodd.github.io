            . I am a gang's porter at Dicekey We had been weighing some sugar for Mr. Grote in the buildings, and laid them down in Ralph key


, in order for shipping to go abroad. Then we went to dinner, and returned to our work in about an hour The man at the bar stood by the hogsheads, and I observed one with the head out, and a great deal of sugar gone. I began to search his pockets, and they were full of sugar. I called my partner and we weighed the sugar over again, and it wanted fifteen pounds; the sugar in his pockets weighed ten pounds. Then he beg'd forgiveness, and said he would not do so any more. He said much the same before my Lord mayor.
Q. Whose property was the sugar?
Winterbourn. It was the property of 
               
                  Andrew 
                  Grote 
               



             and company. (Produced in court.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not get the sugar out of the hogshead but of the ground, as it lay scattered about.



               Guilty

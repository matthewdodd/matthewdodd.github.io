            . I am secretary to the synagogue
 in Dukes'-place


; the plate and other property there is under my care - my house is attached to the synagogue; I am answerable for the property if lost. On the night of the 20th of December last, the synagogue was broken open - a window was taken out; there is a place in the synagogue which we call the ark, in which we keep the books of the Law, and the valuable instruments for ordinary use - the silver pointer was in the ark, and the books of the Law are adorned with silver ornaments; the ark has two locks to it, both of which were broken - there was a copper box with money in it in the pulpit; that was also broken - the silver pointer, which we read the Law with, was stolen, and some silver bells taken off the books of the Law - six rollers, which were attached to the Pentateuch; they were ornamented with bells, which were also taken away; the book of the Law was cut from them and left behind - a copper box was also taken; I had seen all these things safe about nine o'clock in the morning of the 20th of December - the synagogue was left perfectly safe about half-past three that afternoon, and the window was secure; I went there a few minutes after seven next morning, being alarmed, and found every thing in confusion - on looking about I found three rollers left behind, and a phosphorus-box, which I produce; they had broken off the lock of a door, and escaped that way.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have found none of the stolen property? A. No.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  SEDDONS
               



            . On the 20th of December I cohabited with the prisoner Simmons, at No. 22, Elizabeth-street, Waterloo-road - 
               
                  Sol 
                  Davis
               



            , the nephew of the prisoner, 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Davis
               



            , lived in the same house; on the 20th of December, I drank tea in company with Simmons - Wilkinson and Ann Hilyard drank tea with us; they sat down to tea with us - Samuel and 
               
                  Sol 
                  Davis
               



             both came in before tea was over - 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Davis
               



             said to Simmons and Wilkinson, "We will put you up to a good thing, and we will share the money;" he said,"I am going to the Jews' synagogue, in Duke's-place, at four o'clock, and you will meet me at Mr. Hicks', the Lion;" this conversation took place about ten minutes to four - he was to meet him at the Lion public-house, Pearl-row, Blackfriars-road, and they were to go first, (Sol and 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Davis
               



            ) - Simmons and Wilkinson were to follow them - Hicks' is about a quarter of a mile from where we were: Sol and Samuel Davis went first, and the others followed in about half an hour - I staid at home, and about six or half-past six o'clock that evening Wilkinson and Simmons came in, and both laid down; they told me to call them about ten, for they were going to the synagogue - I called them about ten, and went with them to the Crown public-house, at the corner by the obelisk; they did not go into the house - I saw Solomon and Samuel Davis there, both together, talking to them, and they all four went away talking together; Simmons was dressed in sailor's clothes, as he is now - Wilkinson was dressed in a dark olive dress; he wore a coat - they all went away together; I saw nothing more of them that night - I awoke about six o'clock in the morning, and found Simmons had not come home; we had only been living together a few days - finding he had not come home, I knocked at 
               
                  Sol 
                  Davis
               



            ' door, and he gave no answer; we call Solomon 
               
                  Davis 
                  Sol
               



             - I said, "Sol, where have you sent them to?" he said,
"I have sent them to the Jews' synagogue," and if Simmons was not come home, he was taken up for the robbery; he said, "You must go to Worship-street, to inquire there - if you don't find him there, go to Guildhall, and if you hear nothing there, go to the Mansion-house;" a young woman, they call Laura, cohabited with Sol in that room - I went to those three places, and heard nothing of them; I returned home, and in the evening I saw Simmons and Wilkinson, about nine o'clock, at the Crown, at the Obelisk; Simmons asked me if I would take any thing to drink - I said No, and asked where he had been: he made no answer - he pulled out half a sovereign, wanted change for it, and said he had plenty of money; he had nineteen sovereigns and 7 1/2d. - that included the half-sovereign - he said he had got it by property he had stolen from the synagogue; he said this inside the Crown; I had never before seen him in possession of above half a crown, during the time that I lived with him - Sol and Samuel Davis came into the Crown about a quarter of an hour after; I did not sit down and drink there - Samuel Davis said, "Where is Edmund and John?" I said, "In there," pointing to the tap-room- Samuel said, "If they behave wrong to me I will do the same to them;" they then went into the tap-room -Wilkinson and Simmons had left before they got in; Samuel and Sol went straight down to Hicks', the Lion - I went with them; they called Simmons out, talked together, and drank together, but I did not hear their conversation; next day Simmons had two new long coats on, a new belcher silk handkerchief and a new pair of shoes; on the Sunday following inquiry was made of me about another robbery, and Simmons was taken up that Sunday night - I then disclosed to Hammond, the Police-officer, what I knew about it; I was examined four times before the Lord Mayor - it was mentioned at the examination on the Thursday, that a phosphorus-box had been found in the synagogue; I was sent out of the justice-room before I had seen that box - it was shown to me when I came in again, but it was not one that I had ever seen before; another phosphorus-box was afterwards shown to me - I knew that; (looking at a phosphorus-box produced by Ansell) I do not know this - it is not the one that was shown to me the second time.
Q. Look at it again, and tell me do you know that box? A. Yes, this is the phosphorus-box that Simmons was to take with him - he was only to take a box and a bunch of keys; Ann Hilyard, who drank tea with us on the 20th of December, cohabited with Wilkinson.
Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. I may be twenty-two or twenty-three in March; I am not a prostitute now - I have been so, but I now get my living by my own work; I began to do so about three years ago - it is not more than a month ago that I lived with Simmons, but I was getting my living by going out to work, except for the four days I was with him; I had known him before that - I had a grand-mother, who lived in Grey-street, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road, once; I have three brothers - I do not know where one of them is; I do not know that he has been transported - I have heard so, but do not know it for truth; it is twelve or fourteen years since I saw him - I have heard of him, but do not know where he is; a gentleman called, who had seen him, but I do not know where - I have worked for Mrs. Rushmeer, and have lived with a lady at Kennington; I was never at Brixton nor at the Borough Clink -I was never before a Justice but once, and that was when my father took me up for running from home; I then lived where we do now, in Catherine-wharf, Vine-street, near Waterloo-bridge - it was six years ago; I never was taken up on any other occasion, never tried, and never in Brixton House of Correction.
Q. How came you to leave your work to live with Simmons? A. Simmons persuaded me to come from home - when I heard they proposed to rob the synagogue I thought it was shocking - I told 
               
                  Sol 
                  Davis
               



             of it next morning, but nobody else; I said nothing to any of the officers when I went to inquire at the different offices - I swear that I heard of no reward being offered before I gave the information.
Q. Pray how long after this (the 20th of December) did Simmons refuse to live any longer with you? A. He did not refuse at all - I told him I had better go home; he did not turn me off, nor did I say I would get him transported for it - I left him on the Wednesday, went home on Thursday, and lived with my mother, in Vine-street; I have no father - Mrs Marks is the landlady of the house where I lived with Simmons - I saw her and Ann Hilyard here yesterday; Hilyard slept with me on the night the synagogue was robbed - I state this on my oath.
Q. Hilyard and Mrs. Marks are here; I caution you, are you sure of it? A. Yes: Simmons and I slept together up to Monday, and I expected him home on the Monday night - Hilyard lodged with one Franklin, who she left on the Monday, and asked me if she might sleep with me; I said she might - it was nine o'clock in the evening that I had the conversation with Simmons at the bar of the Crown public-house - I do not know how many persons were there, for I was not in the tap-room; I think there were not above three or four persons at the bar - Simmons said to me, just by the side of the bar, "I have plenty of money, and have done the robbery at the Jews' synagogue; I have nineteen sovereigns, &c." and he produced the half-sovereign - I saw the rest in his hand; he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket.
Q. Were you not surprised to hear a man, who had robbed the synagogue, tell you about it at the bar of d public-house? A. He was by himself, talking to me at the side; the bar is a good length - I thought it incautious- I did not tell him to put the money back again; I did not get a farthing of it - he offered me 1s., but I would not have it; I had wanted to go home, and leave him on the Sunday, but I could not without going to my sister first, as my brother would not let me come home when I liked; I could not go without somebody with me, after leaving them in that way - I was too dirty to go through the streets on Sunday - I sent to my uncle, who works at the Surrey theatre, before the Thursday, and asked him to lend me 1s., and got my things washed - I did not think it proper to live with the prisoner at all; I was not forced to live with him - I went to live with him willingly, but could not go home when I liked, after running away in the manner I had - I did not think proper to live with him after I knew what he was going to do; he had told me he had learned carpentering and shoemaking, but I did not see him do any work - I never saw him with more than half a crown; I did not like to take the shilling from him, and borrowed it of my uncle -I had gone to my uncle's, and borrowed it on the Sunday night.
Q. Then you had the whole of Monday to wash your clothes, and go home? A. No, I had not, for he was at home with Wilkinson on the Monday from ten to four o'clock, and again at half-past six - he went out at ten; I did not go home that night; I do not know why; I heard of a reward on the Monday, when Samuel Davis was taken- Joseph, the brother of Sol, told me of it - Hammond, the officer, was with us then; it was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, a week after the transaction - I never heard of the reward from Hammond.
Q. How did you disclose this? A. When they came to me about another robbery, I said it was not the first robbery he had committed, he had robbed the Jews' syngogue - I had no animosity against him; I told him Marks and Hilyard slept in the house, and that Sol Davis slept there: he is related to Marks; 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Davis
               



             said the reward was 40l. - I do not except any of it, nor none I want - I would not have it if it were given to me; my mother lives about half a mile from where I lived with Simmons - I am sure it is above a quarter; my gown was dirty and muddy - I had fallen down in the mud; I believe it was on the Saturday night - I had been cleaning all Saturday afternoon, at Mr. Franklyn's, in Bird-street; I did not say a word about the robbery till three days after it happened - I never went by the name of Moses, and never heard myself called so.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to live with him, and cohabited with him some time? A. I went to live with him on the Friday, and left on the Wednesday, when I found he was a thief; I determined instantly to leave him- my evidence is not affected in the slightest degree by the hope of reward - I never had a criminal charge against me- I worked for one mistress three years; I now work for a friend of hers, and have worked for her twelve months.
JURY. Q. How do you know that to be the box which was in Simmons' possession? A. By the lable on it - I cannot read; I do not know whether there was a lable on the box which was first shown to me - I know this, because the top was almost out when he had it from me; there was no dispute between me and the prisoner about not having any of the property given me; I never had a dispute with him about money.


                  CATHERINE 
                  MOSS
               



            . I am single, and live with my father, who is a clothes-dealer, in White-street, about five minutes' walk from the Jews' synagogue, Duke's-place - my brother goes by the name of Moss, and so do I, but my father's name is Moses - I heard of this robbery the morning after it happened; I knew the person of Samuel Davis, but not the other prisoner; a little before six o'clock in the evening, before the robbery, I was near the synagogue, on the opposite side of the way, and observed three persons - two of them were dressed as sailors; they appeared to be in company together; the prisoner, Samuel Davis, is the one who was not in a sailor's dress - they were just by the door of the synagogue; I saw Samuel Davis point up to the door of the synagogue - he pointed it out to the sailors, as they appeared to be; he appeared to be talking to them- I was not near enough to hear what he said; I am quite certain he is the man who pointed to the door of the synagogue.

Cross-examined. Q. Where were you at this time? A. I had gone on an errand for Mr. Levy, my master, who lives in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch - I am a tailoress; I was in Duke-street - I went to Mrs. Bell's for half a yard of calico; she lives nearly opposite the synagogue door - I was not at work - I was in the street returning home from Mrs. Bell's; I did not tell the Justice that I saw him through a window, where I was at work, for a moment; I am quite sure of that.
COURT. No such statement is in her deposition.
Witness. I remember Davis' attorney being before the Magistrate - he asked me some questions, but I did not tell him that I saw him through the window when I was at work; I could see the synagogue from the shop where I bought the calico - I saw him as I was returning from Bell's; I did not observe any body while in the shop - it was on a Monday evening; I do not know the day of the month - my master came up stairs the next morning, and said the synagogue had been broken open - I immediately turned; he asked why my countenance changed, and I told him this; I was on the opposite side to the synagogue - they were standing in one place; Samuel Davis' face was towards me - the others had their backs to me; I could see Samuel Davis' face quite plain sideways - he stood a little front and a little side-ways.
Q. Then he must have stood with the synagogue behind him? A. He did; I saw him quite plain point to the door - I saw his face quite plain; he stood side-ways -I cannot say whether he pointed with the left hand or the right - (the witness here, with her hand, described the manner, in which the prisoner had pointed to the door.)
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any doubt that he is one of the three men? A. He is; I had seen him frequently, but never spoke to him.


                  JOSEPH 
                  HAMMOND
               



            . I am a Police-officer, and formerly belonged to Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner Simmons last Sunday fortnight, and Samuel Davis the next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I took Simmons on another charge - Seddon was with me at Queen-square, respecting the charge I had apprehended Simmons on, and in consequence of what she told me I apprehended Samuel on this charge - her communication was made to me voluntarily; I attended the examination at the Mansion-house, the first time the phosphorus box was produced - Seddon remained in the room; Mr. Ansell had produced a phosphorus-box - she did not see that before she left the room, to the best of my knowledge - I have a phosphorus-box, that was produced last Thursday - it was produced by the prisoner Simmons; he looked round the office, and wished all the witnesses to withdraw - Seddon and all of them withdrew before he produced the box; he said he wished Seddon to be questioned, if she would not identify the box, as she had one on a former occasion - I cannot say whether this was written down; Seddon came in, and it was shown to her, and then given into my charge - there was no label on it, nor was the head broken in.
Q. This was last Thursday? A. Yes; a box had been shown to her on the Monday before, before the Lord Mayor - they were not both produced together; I first saw her last Monday fortnight, at Queen-square - I had not sent for her; I beg pardon, I now recollect, on the Sunday night that I apprehended Simmons, Seddon was in company with Mr. Basford, in Richmond-street, Lambeth - he is the prosecutor on another charge; I saw her at Basford's house, about nine o'clock - I had forgotten that before- I first conversed with her on the subject of this robbery, on the Monday morning, at Queen-square; she never told me any thing regarding this robbery on the Sunday night- she never mentioned a word about the synagogue till the Monday morning; no reward has been offered for Basford's robbery - I did not appoint for her to come to Queen-square; she had given Mr. Basford the information; before we went into the office she told me this was not the first robbery he had been concerned in - that he was concerned in a burglary in the Jew's synagogue, in the City; I had not heard of that robbery before she told me the parties who were concerned - this was quite voluntarily, and after the examination she went with me to a variety of public-houses, for Sol Davis, but did not find him; I cannot tell whether Seddon was anxious that he should be taken - she conducted herself properly in giving information; I never heard of her till I found her at Basford's.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She named the persons concerned in the robbery? A. Yes; she named Simmons, Samuel and Sol Davis, and Wilkinson; I have made exertions to find the other two, but have not been able.


                  LEWIS 
                  SAMUEL
               



            . I am a general dealer, and live in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch. I heard of the robbery at the synagogue on the Tuesday morning - I was at Whitaker's coffee-house, in Houndsditch, about five o'clock the evening before, and saw the prisoner, Samuel Davis, in company with three more; I never saw Simmons there - I did not know him before.


                  ISAAC 
                  JACOBS
               



            . I am an officer of the synagogue in Duke's-place. On the 22d December I opened the synagogue, which had been broken open, and saw a phosphorus-box laying there, near the ark; I gave it to Mr. Ansell.
Simmons' Defence. All I have to say is, that it is prejudice on the woman's part towards me - I never lived with her; when I first returned from sea, I was in the London-road, late at night, and she accosted me, took me to a house in Ann's-place, Blackfriars-road, and I gave her half a crown - in the morning, when I got up, I went to Mr. May's, and called for some gin, and finding I had not silver, I charged her with robbing me - I have seen her since, but never dwelt with her; she has likewise foresworn herself, which can be proved by the books of Horsemonger-lane, the Borough Clink, and Brixton, and she was taken up for a Mint robbery.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  SEDDON
               



             re-examined. I was in Horsemonger-lane, when my father took me there for running away; I was never charged with theft or other crime - I was not charged with putting off bad money - the prisoner, Davis', brother went to inquire at Horsemonger-lane, on Saturday, if I had been there, and found it was untrue; I was never in Brixton gaol, or the Borough Clink - my father kept me in Horsemonger-lane about six weeks, and took me out himself, on my begging his pardon; he did not charge me with any theft.


                  BENJAMIN 
                  ELMES
               



            . I am turnkey of Horsemonger-lane. I believe Seddon was in my custody some few years ago,on a charge of being disorderly, and I think the charge was made by her father.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear she has never been there for felony? A. I can swear that for the last ten years.


                  ANN 
                  HILYARD
               



            . On the Monday on which the robbery at the Jew's synagogue was said to take place, I was at home with my father - I slept that night at Mr. Stewart's, No. 7, New-street: it is not true that I slept with Seddon; I was not at Mr. Mark's house that afternoon - I neither saw Seddon nor slept with her, nor drank tea with her, nor had any conversation with her and the prisoner.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a married woman? A. I am not. I do not live any where now; I have no particular place of residence - I used to make shifts, and sleep in the Waterloo-road; I did not hear a word of the robbery of the synagogue till last Monday week, when I was taken by Hammond, the Policeman, down the Waterloo-road - he asked if I knew of it, and I said I did not; I swear I knew nothing of it, nor of the silver articles which were taken - I do not know Mr. Winston - I am sure of that. [
               
                  John 
                  Winston
               



             was here called in.]
Q. Now look at that person - did you ever see him before? A. Not to my recollection: I never saw him before - I can swear I never spoke to him.
Q. I advise you to be careful - will you swear you never spoke to him? A. Yes; I never offered him any silver articles for sale or pawn, nor told him they had come from the Jews' chapel - I do not know where he lives; I cannot swear I never saw him, but I have no recollection of him - I was not at No. 84, Waterloo-road last Thursday; I never asked Winston to buy any thing - I have seen Simmons with a female, merely walking the street; I have certainly spoken to him, when I have been with that female - Betsey Seddon, is that female; I know they were acquainted, because I have seen them together - I do not know where he lived; I have seen him come with her to my house, where I used to live - I cannot say they lived together; I never heard so from them - they used to visit me in Bird-street - I cannot exactly say the number; I believe there was a number on the door - I lived there about a month, and left yesterday three weeks; the rooms there, are not let out by the hour or by the night - I will swear it was not a brothel; I have lodged in a brothel, but will swear that is not a house of that description - Mr. Franklyn is the landlord; I had the second floor back room to myself - one man used to come backwards and forwards to me there - it was not either of the prisoners - three females lodged there; it is not a house of ill-fame, nor a receiving house.

                  MARKS
               



            . On the 20th of December, I lived in Whiting-street, Waterloo-road; the witness Seddon, lived there at that time; she gave the name of Simmons - she lodged there but six days; 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hilyard
               



             did not live in my house, nor did she sleep with Seddon on the night of the 20th of December - she did not drink tea with her, nor in my house that evening; I know 
               
                  Sol

            , he did not lodge in my house, nor sleep there on the night of the 20th of December - Seddon slept there, and a young woman slept in the back parlour; I never saw the prisoner Simmons in my house.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Before you take a lodger, I suppose you require a reference? A. Yes, now; I did not have a reference from Seddon, but she represented herself a married woman or I would not have taken her - Hilyard did not lodge at my house - she came once; I do not know Simmons - I have been acquainted with 
               
                  Sol 
                  Davis
               



             four or five years, and always knew him to be respectable - I do not know what he is, nor where he is; I am certain he is no relation of mine - I do not think I have seen him for a month; he came to my house then; he never lodged there.
Q. In the course of the four years you have known him, will you give us the name of any place he resided at?
Witness. Have I a right to answer that question?
COURT. Certainly.
Witness. I know once he lived with his father; I do not know why I am to answer questions, that do not concern the business - that was my only reason for asking the question; I cannot give you the exact residence where he did live - I saw him once at his father's, and he might live there; he said he lodged there.
Q. He told you he did lodge there? A. No, I saw him at his father's - I have not said that he said he lodged there - you have misunderstood me; when I saw him at his father's he did say he lodged there - I cannot tell you the name of the street where the father lived; I forget what part of the town it was in, whether it was East or West - my memory is rather bad.
Q. It may be near St. Paul's or near Hyde Park-corner, for what you remember? A. I forget it, Sir - I am sure I forget it; and I forget how long ago it was I saw him at his father's - I do not remember whether it was three months or two years ago.
COURT. Q. Consider under what a solemn sanction you are now speaking - do you mean to say your memory is so totally void of retention, that you cannot tell whether it is three years? A. I do not know that it is so long; I think it may be a year ago.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear it might not be three months ago? A. I went to see his father; I only went once in my life - I went because his wife lay ill, and I knew her - his father is living now, but I do not know where; I saw him in the street about a week ago - it was more than a mile from my house that I went to see him; I do not know the name of the street, nor what part of the town it was in.
COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you went to see a man, whose wife was ill, and you cannot tell what quarter of the town - was it near East Smithfield, or Cheapside, or St. George's in the Fields, or Spitalfields? A. I think it was somewhere near Spitalfields.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You forget about Spitalfields when you were asked about Hyde Park-corner? A. Yes, it was near Spitalfields - I cannot tell the name of the street: the father was at home and Sol - it was day-light; I went with my mother - I am married, and my husband lives with me - I have known Samuel Davis about twelve months; I do not know whether he is related to Sol - I do not mean to swear that; he is a nephew; I have heard say he is a nephew to Sol, not his brother.
Q. On your oath, do you mean to swear he is not thebrother, but the nephew of Sol? A. Yes, I do swear it; I do not know where he lived - he came to see my husband.

            . I live at No. 54, Surrey-street, Blackfriars. The prisoner Simmons lodged at my house, with his father - I let him in at half-past twelve o'clock on Monday night, the 21st of December.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he lodge with you? A. He lodged with his father since he has been from sea - his father has lodged in my house these ten months, in the front room up stairs; they slept, eat, and drank in one room - there are two beds in the room; I saw Simmons, between seven and eight o'clock next morning, washing himself in the yard, as he always did - he had been out late before, but usually came home about ten; I did not go to the Mansion-house - I did not hear of this charge; I asked the father what had become of Edmund, as he did not come to work - he said he was at his sister's; I never heard any thing about the synagogue till last Saturday.

                  WINSTON
               



            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 84. Waterloo-road. I know the witness Hilyard, and have seen her frequently for the last two or three years, and spoken to her - I knew her well, quite as well as I do my own sister; last Thursday night, I saw her at a house which is my own property, No. 36, Herbert's-buildings, where I went for the purpose of trying to get a little rent - while I was asking my tenant's wife for rent which was due, Hilyard came through the kitchen, and went into the yard; she remained there a few minutes, then came back, and sat at the table - she began to cry and stamp her hand on the table, and said, "Oh! my poor chap;" Mrs. Mapp said, "I should recommend you to speak to Mr. Winston;" she said, "I don't know how ever we shall get my chap through it;" I said, "What is the matter?" she said."Oh, they have been into the b - y Jews' chapel;" I said, "What have they got?" she(Hilyard) said."They have got some wedge;" I asked what that was - she said silver, and said she did not know what she was to do, they wanted money; I told them if they would let me see it, I had no money about me, but I could get some - she then burst out crying again, stamped her hand on the table, and said, "Oh, my poor chap. I would not split for one hundred guineas;" she said, the wedge was nigh at hand - I understood her to mean she would not confess upon her paramour, or her young man; she then went into the front parlour, and I saw no more of her - I gave information to the solicitor for the prosecution; the house was searched last night by the officer.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you give information to the solicitor? A. Yesterday; a person in the market had been talking on the business, and I said I thought I could give information - I wanted to get it from her, to purchase it; I thought if I advanced money on it, and placed it in the hand of the inspector of the Police, it might bring the thing to justice - I am not acquainted with Seddon; I have seen her pass my house at night, but do not know how she gets her living.

             re-examined. I live at No. 34, Herbert's-buildings - I never saw the witness, Winston, to my recollection.
Q. He has stated such circumstances that you cannot but recollect? A. It is all false - I swear I never had any conversation with any body about wedge - I never said, "Oh, my poor chap;" I never used those words in any place - Mrs. Mapp is the landlady; I never had any conversation there on Thursday night with any man - just as I went in doors there was a man coming out, but I never had any conversation with him whatever - I never heard any thing about silver; I never had any silver in that house, or near it, nor knew of any being there.
JURY. Q. Did you mention to Mr. Winston the name of your chap? A. I never mentioned any thing of the kind, which he has been saying.
Mr. WINSTON. She did not mention his name - I have seen her with men, but not with any particular one.
BENJAMIN ELMES. I am turnkey of the County gaol of Surrey. I have a certificate of the former conviction of Simmons - I was present when he was tried, and heard the sentence pronounced upon him; I am positive of his person. (Certificate read.)
Simmons. I acknowledge that is correct.

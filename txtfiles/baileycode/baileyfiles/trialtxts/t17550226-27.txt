            . I lost the things mentioned on the 20th of February, I was told by 
               
                  Martha 
                  Scofield 
               



             that she had seen them in the possession of the prisoner; I had her taken up; after which she confessed she had taken and sold the gown for 4 s. and begged I would forgive her.

                  Scofield 
               



            . I saw the prisoner with the prosecutrix's gown under her arm last Thursday was week, I knew it well before, and when she was secured she owned to the taking it. I had seen it hanging upon a line a little before.
Another woman confirmed the evidence of the other two, as to her confessing she took and sold the gown.
Prisoner's defence.
I never saw this gown, and as to my confession I was in liquor, and what she said it is likely I might have said, be it what they pleased to say.

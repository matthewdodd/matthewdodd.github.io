CHARLES ROWE. I live in Mount-street, Grosvenorsquare


, and am a cabinet-maker
. About nine o'clock in the morning on the 13th of August, I was in the parlour, adjoining my shop - I heard a noise, ran out, and saw the prisoner running with a knife-tray under his arm: he ran into a shed, and got behind a cart - I saw him taken with this tray, which is mine.

JOSEPH ALEXANDER WALKER. On the 31st of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Skinner-street


, and felt my handkerchief pulled from my pocket; I turned round, and saw the two prisoners as close as they possibly could be to me, and no other person was near me; Burgman had my handkerchief in his hand - the officer came up, and seized him. I did not see Prior do any thing.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners in Skinner-street on the evening of the 31st of May - I saw Burgman with the handkerchief in his hand - I crossed, and seized them. They had followed Mr. Walker for sometime.
BURGMAN'S Defence. I was behind the gentleman, but did not touch the handkerchief - it fell down.

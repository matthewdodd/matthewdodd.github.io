JOHN BROWN. alias
 Evans.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of May, 15 yards of silk, value 30s., the goods of 




Moses Hart, his master.






JOEL HART
. I superintend the business of my brother, Moses Hart, who is a linendraper, in Hounsditch. The prisoner had been fourteen days in his employ as shopman—he left on the 14th of May, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, not in his usual way—he seemed agitated and anxious to go—he did not return—he had given no notice of leaving—I missed a great deal of silk next day—this fifteen yards was afterwards found—(looking at it.—it is my brother's—one length was cut off a large roll.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to the silk? A. Yes—this piece has been three years in the house—there is nothing more peculiar about it than other silk, but I am perfectly sure it is my brother's—he referred me to Deptford for his character—I did not go there till after this was found out, and then found he had robbed them.





GEORGE ATTENBOROUGH
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury. The prisoner came to our house on the evening of the 14th of May, to pledge this silk—I asked him who it belonged to—he said, to his mother—that she had bought them for her own wear, and that she was a widow—I thought it odd a widow should wear coloured silks—and from the evasive answers he gave me I suspected he had stolen them, and gave him into custody.





JAMES HENSLEY
. I am a policeman. I took him into custody, and found a key and 12s. and a duplicate on him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you find any knife or scissors with which I could have cut this silk? A. Nothing of the kind.

Prisoner's Defence. I had had the silk in my possession long before I went into the prosecutor's service, having been in the habit of travelling with silk and linen drapery, and these I had not been able to dispose of—they are not his—he does not state the correct length of them.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

MARGARET KELLY



, stealing 1 pair of trowsers, 1 waistcoat, and other articles, value 1l. 7s.; the goods of 



Elizabeth O'Brien; having been before convicted.






ELIZABETH O'BRIEN
. I am a widow, of St. Ann's-court, Soho. The prisoner lodged with me one night—she took the lodging for two months—I went out about nine o'clock in the morning, leaving her in bed—she slept in the same room with me and my little boy—I came home at three, and missed a waistcoat, trowsers, shift, and a sheet—the prisoner was gone, and had not paid—I found the trowsers and waistcoat last night at a marine-store shop in Stain's-court—there is nobody here from there.





GEORGE O'BRIEN
. I am nine years old. I was ill in bed on this day, and saw the prisoner go away about eleven o'clock, and take a gown, pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a shift, a sheet, and a cloak—I was too frightened to speak.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it; I took my own bundle, but nothing else.





FRANK GOODCHILD
 (policeman.) I produce a paper—(read—Margaret Kelly, convicted July, 1847, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

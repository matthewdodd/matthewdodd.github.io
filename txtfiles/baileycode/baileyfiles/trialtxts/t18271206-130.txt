            . I am a carpenter. On the 5th of November, I saw the prisoner in Cleveland-street


; he went into a door-way, and attempted to take a pot off a rail - I watched him; he came away, then went back and took it; I followed, and asked what he was going to do with it - I took it from him; it rattled against another; he said he would give me the two pots to let him go, and resisted a good deal. I took him into a public-house, and found on him four pints and one quart pot in all.

            . These two pots are mine - we lose a great many; the prisoner appeared to have a large pocket made on purpose.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

LOUISA BAXTER
. I live in Bid borough-street, Brunswick-square; the prisoner was my servant for a fortnight. I went to church on Christmas-day, leaving nobody in the house but her—I came home at about a quarter-past one o'clock—I found all the lower part of the house open, every thing turned upside-down, and the prisoner gone—I missed some keys and a sovereign and a half from a drawer which one of the keys would open—I missed a shawl from the front-parlour, and the other articles stated—I went to the station and saw some property of mine and my sister Matilda's, who is on a visit at my house—the money was my own—we lost a great deal of other property, which we have not found.





GEORGE GRANGE

 (police-constable E 107.) I took the prisoner, on the evening of the 28th of December, in a lodging-house in St. Giles—I found the duplicate of the shawl there, and all the other property stated in the indictment—the prosecutrix saw it and identified it.

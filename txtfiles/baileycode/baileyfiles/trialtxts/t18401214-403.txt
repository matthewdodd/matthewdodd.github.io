JAMES JONES
. I am salesman to Edward Groves, in the New Cut, Lambeth. On the 12th of December this waistcoat was outside the shop between eleven and twelve o'clock—I watched the prisoner the whole day—I saw him take it from the front, and put it into his hat—he came towards my shop—he saw me looking at him, and turned back—I collared him—he took off his hat, and threw the waistcoat down an area.





JOSEPH TAYLOR
 (police-constable L 143.) I saw Jones with the prisoner on some steps which joined the area where this waistcoat was.

Prisoner's Defence. Jones never saw me at all—I had not got this waistcoat.

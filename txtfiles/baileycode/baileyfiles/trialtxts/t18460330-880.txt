THOMAS PAYNE
 was indicted

for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Thomas Whinney, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS WHINNEY
. I live in Shepherd's-market—on the 28th March, a little before twelve o'clock, I was in Bridges-street, by the theatre—the officer spoke to me, and I missed my handkerchief from my pocket—this is it—I had had it a minute or two before.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You did not see the prisoner? A. No, I did not see other persons about.





WILLIAM WEST
 (police-constable F 106.) I was in Bridges-street, and saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from Mr. Whinney's pocket—I had watched him a few minutes—I saw him at the corner of the street and followed him—when he took the handkerchief I took hold of him—he threw it on the ground, and I took it up and took it to Mr. Whinney.

Cross-examined. Q. Was there any other person saw this beside youself? A. Not that I am aware of—there was one person behind the prisoner.





JOHN WHITE
 (police-constable R 180.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkcnwell—(read—Convicted 5th Nov., 1844, and confined six months, six weeks solitary)—the prisoner is the person.

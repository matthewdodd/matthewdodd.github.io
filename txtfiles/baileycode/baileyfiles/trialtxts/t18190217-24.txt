            . On the 31st of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in Long-acre


 - I was stopped by an officer, who asked me if I had lost a handkerchief? I felt, and missed it. He told me to follow him. We ran about sixty yards; he overtook Percival before I got up. When I came up I saw the handkerchief drop from Percival - we took him to the Compter.

            . On Sunday evening, the 31st of January, I saw the two prisoners attempt several gentlemens' pockets in a crowd - they then followed Little into Long-acre. I saw Lewis put his hand into Little's pocket, take the handkerchief out, and give it to Percival - they turned back. I asked Little if he had not lost his handkerchief? he said Yes - I told him to follow me. I seized Percival; he said he did not take it, and immediately dropped it. Lewis went away. I knew where he lived, and went and took him about twenty minutes after.

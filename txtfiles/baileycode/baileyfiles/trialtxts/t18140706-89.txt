STEPHEN HETHERIDGE. I am coachman to the honourable Mr. John Kennedy; we stand at livery at Mr. Smith's, in Upper Marybone-street


; it is all in the same yard as the property in the former case was. On the 27th of June, I lost a bridle of my master's; I had the care of that bridle.

            . This was the same night, and the same transaction. On the 27th of June, in the morning, about half past three, I put my light out in my lanthorn; I saw the prisoner, he came on the opposite side of the way; he had two bundles with him. I took him and the two bundles to the watch-house.
THOMAS READ. I produce the bridle; I received it of Dunn.
Hetheridge. This is my master's bridle. Mr. Kennedy's stable is the next stable to Mr. Fonteroy's, and the same entrance.

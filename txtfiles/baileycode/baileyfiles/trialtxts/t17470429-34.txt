Q. to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Freeman 
               



            . Where do you live?
Freeman. In St Bride's Parish, Fleet-Market



.
Q. Was this House broke open?
Freeman. The Door was opened, and two Gallon Pots taken out of my Shop; my Door was shut with a Latch.
Q. When did you miss your two Pewter Gallon Pots?
Freeman. Between nine and eleven. I deal in Wine, my Lord.
Q. Had not a great many People been in your House that Night?
Freeman. I never keep the Door open after 'tis dark.
Q. How do you know when they were taken away?
Freeman. I had just been using of them; I missed them about ten.
Court. You had not shut up your Room?
Freeman. I had not locked it, my Lord, my House was not locked up; it might be lost while the Door was open, under a Pretence of buying Wine; I only prove the losing of my Pots.
Q. How do you know the Prisoners took these Pots?
Freeman. No Reason, no further than the Evidence.
Q. to John Brown. Do you know any thing of the Prisoners at the Bar, or either of them stealing any Pots from Mr Freeman?
Brown. I know that on the 5th Day of February, 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Cobb 
               



            , and 
               
                  John 
                  Ryley 
               



             , and 
               
                  Moses 
                  Holloway 
               



             (who made himself an Evidence about some Tea) and I, the 5th of February, went to this Place; 
               
                  Moses 
                  Holloway 
               



             opened the Door, and 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Cobb 
               



             took one of the Pots; I was with them, I stood close by the Door.
Q. Was no Body in the House?
Brown. There was a couple of People, there seemed to be a Man a writing.
Q. Was Ryley there?
Brown. Ryley stood I believe five Yards off, in order to look out if any Body should come by, to give us Notice.
Q. What Time was this?
Brown. Between nine and eleven; I cannot be certain as to the Time.
Q. What was your Design?
Brown. Our Design was in robbing any one that we could make the best Booty of, so we thought we had an Opportunity of robbing this Shop, the Door being open; the Door was not open, it was upon the Latch; 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Cobb 
               



             brings out the first Pot, and delivers it to 
               
                  Moses 
                  Holloway 
               



            , and he went a-cross the Way with it, and delivers it to 
               
                  John 
                  Ryley

                  John 
                  Ryley 
               



             and I took one, and they another, and we hid them behind the Pump; and we went back again, in order to get the Money-Drawer; but when we were coming back, we heard an Outcry about the Pots, and we returned again, and went off with the two Pots.
Q. What did you do with the two Pots?
Brown. I delivered them to Cobb and Ryley ; I said give me 6 d. to drink, and I will have nothing more to do with them.
Cobb. Prisoner. My Lord, I hope this Man's Oath will not be taken , he has been transported twice; he went by the Name of Stanley .

            . Have you lost any Gown on the 2d of April?
Ray, Yes, but I did not see them take it; but here is the Evidence.

                  Cobb 
               



            , took this Woman's Gown off the Line; I saw him take it from off the Line, in a little Back Yard.
Q. When was it that he took it?
Litchfield. About two o'Clock in the Day; I forgot the Day of the Month.
Q. Did you take him?
Litchfield. This honest Man here took him.

Q. to Tredway, Constable. Did you hear the Prisoner say any thing about it?
Tredway. Nothing at all, my Lord.
[All Cobb's Friends and Neighbours appeared for him again, as upon his former Trial, saying they never heard any hurt of him, a very sober honest Man; either they must have been very ignorant of his Conduct, which can hardly be imagined, or, what is to be feared, much worse, all perjured; for he is the very Person that was tried the last Sessions; was taken among a Nest of Thieves, and appeared to the Court to be a very bad young Fellow.]

            .
[When Sentence of 


               Transportation
             was about to be passed upon Cobb, he cried, and pleaded hard not to be sent out of his native Country, but he was too well known to be suffered to remain any longer in his own.]

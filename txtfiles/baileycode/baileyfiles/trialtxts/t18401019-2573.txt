JOHN JONES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of September, 1 truck, value 2l., the goods of 



Mark Rawlinson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARK RAWLINSON
. I let trucks, and live in Shoe-lane. On the 12th of September the prisoner came, and said he wanted a truck for four hours, and he would return it then—he was to pay me 3d. an hour for the use of it—there was a man I knew something of with him, or I would not have let it him—he never returned it—I found it at Mills's the following week.





EDWARD MILLS
. I live in Helmet-row, Old-street. The prisoner brought the truck to my house on Saturday evening, the same day as it was lent to him—he offered it for sale for 25s.—he said it was his own—I did not give him any thing, because he could not give me a reference—he left it with me late that evening.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress; and I owed some rent; I had had no work since I came out of trouble; I had a job to go to the next week; I got the truck with the intent to take it back again when I began work; I went and got another truck, and got 1l. for it, and then got some oak plank to cover a drain; I was apprehended, or the truck would have been taken back.





GEORGE HOMER
 (police-constable N 229.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of May I fell in with the prisoners at Lisson-grove, about half-past six o'clock in the morning; Hudson had something tied in a bag, and slung over his shoulder; I thought all was not right; I went up to Williams and asked what he had got; Williams was carrying this rope - I told him I should detain them; the other prisoner was carrying an iron casement; I got a person to take care of Williams while I went and took Hudson; before I got up to him he turned into Devonshire-street; I asked him what he had got, and he said old iron! Kilburn is a mile and a quarter from the place where I took them.

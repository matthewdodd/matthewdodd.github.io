Prisoner. I was in liquor; I did not know where I was till the next morning - I asked the officer if he had my money, and he said he had not - I had 7s. or 8s. about me. Witness. He was not in liquor; I had a great deal of trouble with him - it took four of us to get him to the station; I asked what money he meant; he said 7 1/2d., but he had nothing when he was searched - he might have lost it.

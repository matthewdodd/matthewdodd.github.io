JOHN HALL
. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Holborn on the 12th of February, at a quarter before ten o'clock—I saw this basket (producing it) taken from off the prosecutor's cart as it was going along—the two prisoners were in company together—I had seen them go about twenty yards together—the cart was going along, and both of them took bold of the basket—West ran away with it, and I stopped him about thirty yards from the cart—Bray got away, but he was taken about four hours after, the same night.





SARAH PENDRY
. My husband's name is Thomas—I am a laundress. This basket (looking at it) is mine, and the contents were going to the owner—they were in my keeping and custody—it was at the back of the cart—I did not find it was gone till the officer brought it—it contained all the articles stated in the indictment—I was inside the cart, driving.


Bray. I know nothing of the charge—I was not there at the time.

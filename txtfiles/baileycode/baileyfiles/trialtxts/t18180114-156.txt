. On the 12th of January, at three o'clock in the afternoon, the cotton hung at the door-Thompson came in, and I then missed it. He took me to the watch-house, where I found it.

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of January, about half-past three o'clock, I was about one hundred yards from Hawkins's shop, and saw the prisoners running together as fast as they could. Morris had something covered over in his apron. I followed them - They turned up Charterhouse-lane - I lost sight of them for half a minute. I knew Iffgrave before - I caught sight of them again, they were running together; Merris ran into a house, I went in and secured him, and took the cotton out of his apron-Iffgrave was brought back. I asked Morris where it came from? he said, from the linen-draper's, in St. John's-street.
JAMES STAINTON. I saw the prisoner running together up Charterhouse-lane, and took Iffgrave.

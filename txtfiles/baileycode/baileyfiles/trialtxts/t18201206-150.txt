            . I am an ironmonger

, live in St. John-street, Smithfield


, in partnership with

            ; the prisoner was a journeyman carpenter
, and at work at my house. In consequence of locks being missed from the shop, and a candle being moved from where it was left, I gave information to Thissleton, the officer, who took him as he left work, and found the candle, a brass wheel, and several brass ornaments in his coat pocket. I had left them in a room over the shop.

On Thursday, the 5th of September, I saw the two prisoners at the corner of Plumtree-street, Bloomsbury—they saw me, and went different ways—we stopped Cosgrove, and found he had a blanket—I went down George-street, and found Stokes—he had a blanket also—he said he bought it of a sweep—Cosgrove was dressed as a sweep.





WILLIAM BOYCE

JOHN ASHTON

These blankets are his—I had the care of them—they were taken out of the booth at Bartholomew fair—they were used to keep the serpents in—I saw some sweeps there on Thursday morning, between twelve and one o'clock—the officer and I went down and put several boys out from under the carriages.

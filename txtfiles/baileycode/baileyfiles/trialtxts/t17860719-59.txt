             sworn.
I live at the White-horse in Hanover-yard; I lost a bridle on the 9th of June; I was riding with it till past eleven, and I went into the stable at two, and between eleven and two it was offered for sale; I am sure the bridle was mine, it was plated, and entirely new; it was brought to me by 
               
                  John
                   Clarke
               



             to know if it was mine; I knew it directly.
Did you ever examine to see if your bridle was missing? - No, I was so satisfied that I knew it; I can very safely swear to it; I know nothing of the prisoners; I saw Newton once before; I never saw him in my stable; the bridle was new, and the bit plated and not new.

                   CLARKE
               



             sworn.
I am a sadler in Charles-street, Soho; the prisoner Knight came before the other with some plated fronts, on the morning of the 9th of June, and roses and some plated coach bits; he wanted to sell them; I asked him how he came by them; and he said, he lived with a captain that was going abroad, and he gave them to him.
Prisoner Newton. It was me that came with the bridle to that man's shop.
Clarke. Between the hours of one and two on the 9th of June, the prisoner Newton came with a leather bridle and a plated bitt, I asked him how he came by it, he said, honestly, he bought them; I knew the bridle to be Mr. Fell's; I sent one of my men for Mr. Fell, he was not at home; then Newton said, he would go and fetch the man he bought it of; I kept the bridle and let Newton go; I went over to the stable; I saw the bridle two days before, and cut out the stuff for it; the bit was an old bit; I met the two prisoners together, after Mr. Fell sent for me, and I went to Rolly's, a sadler, in Tottenham-court-road, and the prisoners were there offering another bridle to sell; I told the hostler, them were the men that brought the bridle; then they were stopped, the hostler's name is

                   BROOKE
               



             sworn.
I am hostler to Mr. Fell; I had not missed this bridle; I did not examine particularly, because I should know the bridle from ten thousand; I saw the prisoner Newton on Friday the 9th of June, a little after ten at night, he was by himself, he would ask me to drink part of a pint of beer, and he said, he would call every morning, I refused at first, but we had one pint of beer at the top of the gateway; our stables are in Hanover-street; Hanover-yard, down in the yard a good way; there is only one gateway into the yard.

Could any body have past you at this time when you was drinking the beer with him? - I do not imagine they could; I saw him again at Mr. Rolley's with the other prisoner, and I stopped them both.

             sworn.
I produce a plated bit and bridle; I apprehended the two prisoners and Mr. Clarke gave it to me at the Dolphin alehouse; and I have had it ever since.
(The bridle deposed to by Mr. Fell.)
Mr. Clarke, is that Mr. Fell's bridle? - Yes.
(Deposed to also by the hostler.)
Prisoner Newton. I do not wish to say any thing; I had the bridle from Knight.
Clarke. He told me he bought the bridle; I afterwards met Knight, and he told me he saw him buy it.
Court. There is not evidence enough to put Knight on his defence.
Court to Fell. Did your stable appear to be broke open? - No; there is no lock on the door; I hung the bridle up in the stable myself.
What may be the lowest value of it? - It is worth about ten shillings.
Would it sell for ten shillings? - Yes.

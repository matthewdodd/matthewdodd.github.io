2173. 




WILLIAM HOARE
 was indicted

 for stealing 19 lbs. weight of lead, value 3s. 6d.; the goods of 



William Padgett, his master.






WILLIAM PADGETT
. I live at Barnes, in Surrey, and am a plumber. I employed the prisoner to work for me at Putney, as a bricklayer, to make good the tiling of a building there—I missed some lead from there—I have compared the lead produced with that on the house there—I find it corresponds exactly with my lead, and with the measure—I will swear this is part of the lead that came from that house.

Prisoner. That lead never was yours; I purchased it of a man when I was going home from work; I went up to the top of the town to the Post-office, and there I got employment; I found Thomas Paling was coming to do your work, and I left it; I bought it the week after I left your premises.

Witness. It was part of my lead and part of the lead that is down in this book.





THOMAS DALY
 (police-constable V 33.) I went to the prisoner's house—I found this piece of lead on the wash-house shelf, occupied by the prisoner, and by no other person—I was not searching for any charge against him—his son lived in the same house with him—the prisoner was not at home when I went—the son was, and he said he worked for a plumber, who allowed him to take the chips, and this was part of it—the prisoner came home while I was there, and said he had purchased it six weeks before, at Hammersmith.





WILLIAM PADGETT

re-examined. The prisoner's son worked for me, as well as his father, at the same job.

Prisoner's Defence. I purchased it, and gate half-a-crown for it.




GUILTY
.** Aged 56.—


Transported for Seven Years.—(See the next case.)

. On the 14th of November I was in my bed-room; I saw the prisoner come up stairs, and go into a watercloset - he staid there a few minutes, and then went into the servants' bed-room; he took something, and went into the water-closet again - I stopped a few minutes, then opened the door, and saw him concealing a dress in his small-clothes; I said, "What were you doing in that bed-room?" he said, "Nothing at all;" I said, "I heard you there? - he then said, "I have got a dress, but do not say any thing about it;" I called the girl up to whom it belonged.

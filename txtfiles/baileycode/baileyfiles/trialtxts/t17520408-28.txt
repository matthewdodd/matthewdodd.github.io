            . On a Saturday night about a month ago, I was near the prosecutor and prisoner, in Grace-church street, I saw the prisosoner with the handkerchief in his hand, I did not see him take it, I saw him drop it, and believe the prosecutor took it up, he took the prisoner, who denied it, and cry'd; the prisoner ran about a quarter of a yard.
Q. to Rowley. How far did the prisoner run?
Rowley. He ran from the side of the way to the middle of the street.

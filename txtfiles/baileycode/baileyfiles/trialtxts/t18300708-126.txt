            . I am a butcher
, and live at No. 80, Tower-street


. The prisoner was my apprentice
 - I hadmissed money repeatedly; and on the 8th of June I put 4s. worth of halfpence into the desk - I missed some of them; I then determined to place some silver there to detect him - I had before that found in his pocket a key, which opened my desk, and I took it away; I marked 30s. in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, and put them into the desk; early the next morning I got the officer into the parlour, which commands a view of the desk - I rang the bell for my apprentices to come down; the prisoner ran down first, without his shoes; he went to the desk and opened it with another key - when he came from the desk I said to the officer, "Open the door and take him;" he did so, and found one half-crown, a crown, and 3s. in his hand, and this key in his pocket - it was all marked, and was missing from the desk.

Prisoner. I leave it entirely to the mercy of the Court.

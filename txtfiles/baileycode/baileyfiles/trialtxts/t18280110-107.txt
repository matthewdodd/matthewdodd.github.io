            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 20th of December, about eight o'clock, I met the prisoner near Turnham-green, with two bundles on his shoulder; I asked what he had got; he said he did not know: another lad, who was with him, ran away. I took the prisoner, and found these articles in the bundle, and a duck, which had just been killed; he was about a mile from the prosecutors'.
BENJAMIN GEORGE FRENCH PHILPOT. I live on Acton-green


. I know this property - the shoes and trousers are my servant's; the rest is mine; I have seen the prisoner about; the property was taken from my harness-room - I was in town at the time.
HENRY HOLLOWAY. I am servant
 to Mr. Philpot. My shoes and trousers were safe in the harness-room that evening. They broke open a window, which looks into a lane, to get in.

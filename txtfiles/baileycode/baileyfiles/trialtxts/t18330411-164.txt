            . I live at No. 12, Martha-street, St. George's, and am a hatter
. On the 4th of April I was by Gold-hill, Shadwell


, and saw the prisoner, and another girl - the prisoner sprang at me, clasped her hands round my neck, and I felt something go from my pocket, which she gave to the other girl, but I could not see what it was; I held the prisoner, and gave charge of her - I missed half a crown from my pocket.
JOHN NICHOLAS (Police-constable K 38). I took the prisoner to the station; I found no money on her.
Prisoner. The man states that he felt my hand in his pocket - why not hold it there, to have a proof of the robbery? I saw him go down a turning with a female - he returned in five minutes, put his hand on my shoulder, and said I had robbed him; I was unfortunately standing for a friend, when he took hold of me, and said I had robbed him - I said, "How can you say that? when you went down that turning with a female;" he said, "She is a companion of yours - I will give charge of you."

            . I certainly had not been with any female - I had but just parted with my son.

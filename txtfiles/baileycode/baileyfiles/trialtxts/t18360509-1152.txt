WILLIAM PODGER
. I was in Newgate-market on the 9th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening with Mr. Shore—we were buying some meat—I felt something going from my pocket—I put my hand down and my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner walking away, looking towards me—I

went before her and called Mr. Shore—he if she had not a handkerchief that did not belong to her and she dropped it—this is it, here are my initials on it—I am sure it is the one she dropped.





CHARLES SHORE
. I was with the prosecutor—I heard him call me—he said two girls went on, and one had taken his handkerchief—I am before them and stopped them—they tried to get away—I took them both, when I saw this handkerchief fall from the prisoner's shawl.





THOMAS BRADY
. I am a police-inspector. I took the prisoner and have the handkerchief.

Prisoner. I was going to meet a person in Paternoster-row—two men ran up against me and shoved me on some turnip-tops on a basket—these two gentlemen came up, and the prosecutor said he had lost his handkerchief, and they said, "This is the girl"—I had not seen the handkerchief.

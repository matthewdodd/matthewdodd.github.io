JAMES SHUTE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of April, 1 sixpence, 1 penny, and 6 halfpence, the monies of 



James Hogg; from the person of 



Jane Hogg; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JANE HOGG
. I am the wife of James Hogg, we live in West-street, Southwark. On the 10th of April, between six and seven o'clock, I was going over London Bridge—I had a sixpence, a penny-piece, and six halfpence in my pocket—I was told something, and missed my money—I did not see the prisoner—a pencil and a small stone were left in my pocket, but the money was gone.





JAMES TIDMARSH
 (police-constable M 51.) I was on duty, and saw the prisoner lift up the woman's dress, and take something from her pocket with his right hand—I crossed and asked what she had been robbed of—I went after the prisoner and took him, and in bringing him back he threw the money over the bridge.





JOHN MORRIS
. I was on the bridge. I saw the prisoner lift up the woman's dress with his left-hand, and put his right-hand into the pocket.

Prisoner. I threw nothing over the bridge, neither was I near the woman—I have a poor mother, and I am her whole support.






JAMES GIRLING
 (police-constable M 275.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

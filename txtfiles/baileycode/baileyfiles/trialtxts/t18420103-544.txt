JAMES HOLMES
 and 




MARTIN KELLY
 were again indicted for

 stealing, on the 
12th of December, 261bs. weight of lead, value 4s., the goods of 



Thomas Hodges, and fixed to a certain building.






JAMES CLIFFORD
. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoners on the morning of the 12th of December, talking together at the end of the court, and again at half-past seven o'clock—Kelly was coming out of the court, and Holmes was two yards behind him—on seeing me, Kelly turned round and spoke to Holmes, who ran away—I pursued, and caught him running into Kelly's house—I found on him a quantity of lead, part of which I

now produce—the other part was produced at the last trial—this quantity of lead I fitted to the other house—it is 24lbs.—it corresponded with the house—I took Kelly next day.
(Margaret Donoghue being called did not appear,)





THOMAS HODGES
. One of the houses next to Kelly's belonged to me and others, but I am the householder—I compared the lead produced—it fitted where it was cut from at the nail holes, and where it was torn off.

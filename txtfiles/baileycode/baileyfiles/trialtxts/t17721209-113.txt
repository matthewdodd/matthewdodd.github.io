             was indicted for that he, 


               together with divers other people, to the number of fourteen, were found passing within five miles of a certain navigable river, to wit the river Avon, with seventeen horses, upon which were put more than 6 lb. of tea, to wit 12 lb. and brandy exceeding the quantity of five gallons, to wit forty-five gallons, the said tea and brandy not having paid the duty, and did hinder, obstruct, assault, and oppose 
                     
                        Jacob
                         Garrard
                     



                  , a supervisor of excise, in the execution of his office, in seizing the said tea and brandy
            .
Another court charged it the same as before but not with going armed.


                  Jacob
                   Garrard
               



            , a supervisor of excise at Chichester, deposed that having an information on the 1st of May, that some smuggled goods were to pass over the river Avon, (which is navigable) over Greetham-bridge, he collected three officers, Playford, Hubbard and Warren, and waited in order to make a seizure; that at half after 11 at night 15 or 16 smugglers on horseback loaded came to a gate at the parting of the road, where he and Hubbard were stationed; that they were discovered by the smugglers, who challenged them to a combat, upon which they fired a pistol, as a signal for Playford and Warren, who were stationed at another place to come to their assistance; upon which Hubbard's horse reared several times; that then he rode up to the smugglers, whose horses were loaded with casks, and oil case bags; that he asked them what they had got; that upon that they cried out
"G - d d - n him, knock him down, knock him down;" that then he was set upon by several of them, who beat him in a very violent manner, knocked him down, and tumbled their horses over him; that then they forced him towards a ditch about a road wide, and proposed to murder him, and throw him in; that then they forced him into the ditch; that he exerted himself, and slipt in so as to have his face upon the bank, and lie partly out of the water; that he received two violent blows as he was falling with large sticks or whips; that some of them had sticks as big as a man's wrist; that then one man struck him upon the eye, and another gave him a blow that took away his senses; that he soon recovered, and seeing the smugglers in confusion, and imagining that Playford and Warren were come to his assistance, he exerted himself, and got out of the water; that as he was rising, a smuggler upon a bald-faced horse, lifted up a whip, or stick, and threatened to knock him down, upon that recollecting he had a pistol in his waistcoat pocket, he presented it to him, upon which he gave back; that then Playford and Warren distinguished him, and Playford gave him his sword; he had wrested a whip from one of the smugglers, which he kept for his own defence; that then he and Playford stood back to back, and one of the smugglers, who was on his right, struck at the pistol, and knocked the cock down, but being wet it did not go off; that at the same time, another attacked him on the left with a large stick many times, which he held in both hands, because it was too large for one; (he described that man to be about the size and shape of the prisoner); that he was obliged to use the sword with his left hand while he held the pistol in his right; that he pricked him three times with his sword; that the last time he cut him on the cheek, under the left eye, upon which he gave back a little, which gave him an opportunity of changing his sword to his right hand, being released from the man he had presented the pistol at; that the smuggler continued to press upon him with his stick, upon which he pushed at him very hard; that he had a loose riding coat in, which seemed to prevent the sword penetrating; that the second time the sword went through his clothes, and the third thrust he stabbed him just under the left breast; that then the man left him, and the smugglers collected together and went off with their goods; that he found three tubs of brandy in the road, and then Hubbard came up and informed them that his horse had run away with him and had thrown him; that then Warren and Playford went in pursuit of the smugglers, and Hubbard went in search of his horse; he returned with his horse, and a fourth cask of brands, which they found in the road just beyond where the attack was made; that the man on the bald faced horse, and another came up, swore at him, and threatened him, upon which he presented a pistol to them, that he had received from Playford, upon which they went swearing away towards Hubbard; that he went to Hubbard's relief, and presently met him, who told him that the smugglers had taken the casks from him, and had threatned to murder him, but he said he knew them; that they were Will Skinner, 
               
                  Joe
                   Skinner
               



            , and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Butcher
               



            ; that then Hubbard went away to shift for himself, and he went to a house for some relief, as he was wounded much and had lost a great quantity of blood.


                  John
                   Hubbard
               



             confirmed the evidence of 
               
                  Jacob
                   Garrard
               



            , as far as he was concerned, and deposed that the prisoner was one of the smugglers, and that he had known him from a child, and that there were also William Skinner, and 
               
                  Joseph
                   Skinner
               



            , and also that he opened the staves of one of the casks he found upon the road with his knife, and tasted the contents, which was brandy.


                  Mathew
                   Warren
               



             confirmed the evidence of Garrard and Hubbard as far as he was concerned, and produced a very large stick, which he said he took from the man whose face was bloody, and that the stick was bloody when he took it.
- Gill deposed that he saw Hubbard on the 2d of May, and that then Hubbard told him that the two Skinners, and the prisoner were part of that company, and that he was present when the prisoner was examined before the Justice, on the 26th of May; that he had then the mark of a wound in his face, which he said he received by a kick from a horse; that the justice asked him if he had not got a wound in his left breast; that he denied it; that he described what part of the breast Garrard had wounded the man, as Garrard had informed him, and that upon examining the prisoner, there was the mark of a wound newly skinned over, just in the place he had described, which appeared to have been given by the point of a sharp instrument, and that the prisoner said that wound also was given by the kick of a horse.


                  Robert
                   Playford
               



             confirmed the evidence already given as far as he was concerned.

The prisoner in his defence denied the charge, and in order to falsify Hubbard's testimony, he called 
               
                  John
                   Stamford
               



            , who deposed that he lay in the same bed with 
               
                  William
                   Skinner
               



            , at Kaple in Surry on the 1st of May.

                   Sayer
               



            , 
               
                  Mary
                   Hooker
               



             and 
               
                  John
                   Mills
               



             confirmed this evidence.
He called 
               
                  Edward
                   Rossiter
               



            , who deposed that the prisoner was slightly kicked in the face by a mare while he was dressing her, and in the side; being asked to explain that, he said the mare kicked with both legs.


                  Thomas
                   Skinner
               



            , his master, deposed that he left his house to go to bed between nine and ten, on the 30th of April, and that he saw him at work between three and four the next morning, and that his horse is about four miles from Greetham Bridge; upon his cross examination he acknowledged he (Skinner) had himself paid 70 l. for smuggling, and 
               
                  James
                   Butler
               



            , Esq. a magistrate for the County of Sussex, deposed that 
               
                  John
                   Hubbard
               



             bears a very bad character, and it was his opinion that he ought not to be believed upon his oath.

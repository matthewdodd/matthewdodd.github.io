            . I am servant to Mr. Richard Hewitt, cabinet-maker
 of Hammersmith. On the 21st of March, an alarm was given, and a piece of carpet was missed from the front of the shop; I ran out and took the prisoner, between three and four o'clock, at Kensington, with it - I did not see him till I got there; he had it under his left arm- I went up to him, and said I had every reason to believe it was masters; I secured him. I had seen it safe that morning; I left it at the watch-house with Mrs. Bennett.
RICHARD HEWITT. This is my carpet. I went out about one o'clock, and left it safe then - I have a piece here, which matches it.

            . I am thirteen years old, and live with my father, Thomas Scott, in Macclesfield-street, City-road


 - he is a glass-painter
. On the 8th of March, at a quarter to four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go away from the house - the street door was open - she got about fourteen yards from the house, and I saw she had got my father's coat - I screamed out for my mother, and she was taken - this coat, the skirt, and spencer, were found on her - the coat had been on the top of the bedstead in the second floor room.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner come down the steps of the house with the coat on her arm - this girl called out, "She has got my father's coat;" I ran, took her, and took this coat, spencer, and skirt from her - she seemed rather in liquor.

, and live in Bishopsgate-street


. On the 17th of February, about half-past eight o'clock at night, these stockings were stolen off a wire in the shop. They have not been found.

            . I was Mr. Cazaly's servant. I saw the prisoner put his hand in, reach round the wire guard, pull the stockings off, and run away. I ran after him, and saw him drop something - he was stopped in Spital-quare; I am sure he is the man. I only lost sight of him in turning the corner.

            , and live at Stepney, at the Dolphin and Crown


, a public house. I had been robbed several times before, and was resolved, if possible, to find out the thief. There were twenty half crown rolls of halfpence in paper, when I went to bed on the 19th of March, in a box in the bar, which was nailed to the wainscot. I had seen them all there in the afternoon. I missed three rolls on the 20th. We suspected the prisoner; she was our servant. We searched her box, and found three rolls in it. She was present when we searched. Then she held up her hands, and begged I would say nothing about it, and said, she would stay and work it out. (Produced in court.) I can take upon my oath to say these are some of the rolls that were in my box; we make them up in a very particular way.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

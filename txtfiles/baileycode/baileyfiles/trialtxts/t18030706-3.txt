; I lost a coat, which was hanging up in my bed-room; I saw it on the evening of Friday the 3d of June, when I went to bed; I missed it at eight o'clock the next morning; the room-door was not fastened; a young man of the name of James Knight slept with me, and does now; he was up before me; after he was gone, I thought I heard my door go; I looked, and missed my coat; I got out of bed, and went down stairs; I overtook the prisoner on the landing-place of the stairs, with her back against the wall; I asked her who she was, and then I saw the coat drop from behindher; I had never seen her before; she said, she had not a friend in the world; I took her back into the room, and dressed myself; I then got an officer, and took her to Bow-street. - (Produces the coat.)
Prisoner's defence. A young man asked me to breakfast with him that morning, and I made a mistake, and went to the wrong house; I never was in the room till the prosecutor took me into it; I never saw the coat.

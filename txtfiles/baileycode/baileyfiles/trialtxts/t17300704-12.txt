            , the same Day and Time.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner came to live with the Prosecutor, claiming Kindred with her, and had liv'd there about four Days, when she took the opportunity to go away with the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, part of which were 
               
                  Elizabeth

                  Bell 
               



            , who had Lodgings there.
The Prisoner having little to say in her Defence, the Jury found her 


               Guilty of the first Indictment to the Value of 10 d.
             but 

               acquitted her of the second

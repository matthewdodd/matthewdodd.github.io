Austin Thompson. I live in King-street, Seven-dials


. I was not in the way when a looking-glass was taken away about three weeks ago. We suspected the prisoner, (he was a lodger
 in the house) and took him up, and charged him with taking it; he confessed he did take it. I took him before Justice Welsh; he there owned the same, and that he gave it to his wife, who sold it for 3 s. in Broker's-alley.
Keazey his wife confirmed the evidence he had given.

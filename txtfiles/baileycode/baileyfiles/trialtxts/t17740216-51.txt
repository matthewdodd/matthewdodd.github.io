            . I live in Great Turnstile. On the 9th of February a servant of Mr. Brown, the pawnbroker, informed me he believed they had stopt a pair of my shoes; I went there, and found they were my property; there were six other pair my property, that the pawnbroker said were pawned by 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Smith
               



            ; the mark was blotted out, and the ink wet when they were brought to pawn; the pawnbroker put his hand in, and it coming out wet made him suspect they were not honestly come by.

            . I am servant to Mr. Harris: I know the shoes to be my master's property.

            . I am servant to the pawnbroker; the shoes were brought by 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Smith
               



            ; I asked her whose they were; she said her landlord's, and went and brought him, and he said he had them of the prisoner for rent; the prisoner was sent for; he said they were his, and he would fetch a person to his character; he came again and said they were shoes he had to make for a master and desired to have them again .
The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.

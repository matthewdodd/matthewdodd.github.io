THOMAS BOYLE
. I live in St. John-street, Clerkenwell. I lost some pieces of silk handkerchief, about the 3rd of November—they were worth about 3l.10s.—these are part of them. (See page 76.)





JOHN ROE
. I am an officer. On the 4th of November, I went to Mr. Upsall's—he showed me a handkerchief, and told me to make inquiry, which I did, and found the prosecutor had lost three pieces of handkerchief—I then took him to another pawnbroker, and showed him two more—I went to the prisoner's house, No. 2, Harper-street—she came home at night, and was taken—I asked if she had not been to Mr. Upsall's, and she denied it.





ROBERT UPSALL
. I am a pawnbroker. On the 3rd of November, the prisoner came and owned these handkerchiefs, which had been pawned by Tyson and Mary Ann Davis.





JOHN HARRISON
. I am an officer. I produce the certificate of the former conviction of the prisoner, which I got at Mr. Clark's office, and know she is the person.

Prisoner's Defence. I left home to go to work in the morning—I met a friend—we had something to drink, and I was not fit to go to work—I then met the girls, who asked me to go and get the handkerchiefs—I went and said they belonged to me, but I had never seen them.




GUILTY
. Aged 49.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

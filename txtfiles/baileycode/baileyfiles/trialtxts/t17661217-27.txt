            . I am an Irishman. On the 16th of November I was coming home, between one and two in the morning, to Castle-street, Long-acre; I was within 20 or 30 yards of my own house; I was going in at the Turk's-head to have a pint of beer; I was very much fuddled; there were two men came out and entered into discourse with me; one of them took my watch and ran away; I followed him, but he got off; I cannot recollect any of the persons; I advertised my watch, two guineas reward; after that I was sent for to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, there I saw the watch and the prisoner; (the watch produced and deposed to.)
Q. Are you sure you had your watch in your pocket, when you was going in at the Turk's-head?
Hefernon. I am sure I had it when I was robbed of it.
Q. What did the prisoner say before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ?
Hefernon. He said he had won it at tossing up.
Mr. Brown. I am pawnbroker, and live at the corner of Bedford-street, in Halfmoon-street; the prisoner brought this watch to my shop and asked me to lend him two guineas and a half upon it; this was on the 17th of November; I asked him how he got it; he said he got it by tossing up, upon the ruins of St. Giles's; I turned to a book which I keep of every watch that is advertised; there I saw the watch advertised; I went to my next door neighbour in order to get assistance to secure him; in the mean time he got away; then I gave information of the watch to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , by which means he was detected.
Prisoner's defence.
I got this watch by tossing up against another watch, upon the ruins of St. Giles's.
For the prisoner.


                  Thomas 
                  Nicholls 
               



            . I am a sawyer, and live in Halfmoon-alley, Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner is a jeweller. Last Monday was a month I was on the ruins of St. Giles's; I saw a parcel of people got together; my partner said, Tom, here is Will Sutton, he was tossing up for a watch and won it, but I should not know the watch again.


                  Joseph 
                  Nicholls 
               



            . I am a sawyer; I was with 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Nicholls 
               



             at this time; it was on a Monday, between five and six in the evening; I saw two watches lying on the ground; they tossed up five out of nine; he won the other man's watch; the other man was a short man, with a curled wig.
Q. Was you in company with the prisoner the day before?
J. Nicholls. No, I was not.
Q. Should you know the watch again that he won?
J. Nicholls. No, I could not; the watches had both white faces.
Q. to T. Nicholls. Was you in company with the prisoner the night before.
T. Nicholls. No, I was not.

            . I live in Mark-lane. On the 25th of July, I was coming out of change, about half-past four o'clock - I felt somebody behind me pressing, and then felt something drawn from my pocket; I turned round, and perceived the prisoner putting my handkerchief into his pocket. A gentleman came up, and we secured him, and took it from him. He said he picked it up.

I keep the house that was broken open: I am a carpenter
, No. 23, Crown-street, Moor-fields


. On the 20th of September, my house was broke open; I left it at one at noon, to go to work; then I went where my wife was, and came home with her at past six; I let lodgings from top to bottom; I do not know which of them were in the house; I left my wife at home; when I returned, I found 
               
                  William
                   Woodhouse

             sworn.
I am wife to the prosecutor. My husband went out at one; I went out between two and three: I left the people in the two pair of stairs rooms; their name is Stokes; I cannot tell whether 
               
                  William
                   Woodhouse
               



             or 
               
                  William
                   Thompson
               



             were within or not; when I returned between six and seven with my husband, I found my house had been broke open, by finding my door open; all the property is in court. The prisoner Mary Parker frequently came to see the people in our one pair of stairs room; their name was Woodhouse; I do not know the prisoner 
               
                  Edward
                   Gardener
               



            ; but our property was found on his premises; and I saw 
               
                  Thomas
                   Cave
               



             take my husband's shirt off Gardener's back, the third day after the robbery; that shirt is here: I saw the things at 
               
                  Mary
                   Parker
               



            's lodgings.


                  WILLIAM
                   VALE
               



             sworn.
I am a constable at Union-hall. I searched some lodgings which I was informed was Parker's; the people that told me so are not here; I found the property in the lodgings; it is here.


                  THOMAS
                   CAVE
               



             sworn.
I apprehended the two prisoners at their lodgings, where Vale had been; they came home together about eleven; I took them to the watch-house; and under one of 
               
                  Mary
                   Parker
               



            's arm-pits, I found a box of duplicates; and a shirt and handkerchief belonging to the prosecutor, on Gardener's back; Gardener said immediately, Parker gave them to him, in her presence, and she did not deny it; she would give no account: I went to the pawnbroker's, and took the prosecutors with me; and they swore to the property.
(The duplicates produced.)
(The witnesses examined separate, at the request of Mary Parker.)

                   GRAYSON
               



             sworn.
I received these things of the prisoner 
               
                  Mary
                   Parker
               



            ; I knew her before she pawned them; she told me they were her husband's; she pawned them for five shillings.
(A pair of breeches deposed to by the prosecutor, by a slit in the lining, and a gown, and a laying-inn gown.

                   GRAYSON
               



             sworn.
I took in a gown and petticoat, and waistcoat of the woman prisoner, for three shillings and three pence, on the 20th of September, between seven and eight in the evening: Mr. Grayson was not present.
Prosecutor. I know my wife's petticoat and gown, and this laying-inn gown.

             sworn.
I am servant to

                   Parker
               



            , pawnbroker, Bermondsey-street; I know the prisoner

                   Parker
               



            ; she pawned a blue coat for half a guinea, and a white dimity gown for six shillings, the 21st of September, in the morning, between seven and eight, in the name of 
               
                  Mary
                   Gardener
               



            ; she said they were her husband's property; and he had passed his word for a person; I never saw her before to my knowledge; but I am positive she is the woman that pawned them.
(Deposed to.)
Here are my gloves in my pocket; I lost a tea-caddy with two guineas in it.

                   BRIANT
               



             sworn.
I am a poor washerwoman; I live next door but one to the prosecutor; and I was at home that evening, the 20th of September, about six in the evening; and I saw the prisoner 
               
                  Mary
                   Gardener
               



             on the step, coming from the house, with her apron as full as she could hold it; it was quite chuck full.

                   BAGGIT
               



             sworn.
I am a silk winder. I met 
               
                  Mary
                   Parker
               



             the 20th of last month, between five and six in the evening, with her apron full, coming from the prosecutor's, about ten yards from his house.
PRISONER PARKER's DEFENCE.
On the 20th of September, I was at Rag-fair, never near the house at all.
Mrs. Grayson. The prisoner Parker took a caddy out of her apron the same evening, as she stood close to the counter, in my shop; she opened it, and took two guineas out of it; she broke it open with the scissars; the caddy is here.

            , and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Vale. The landlord and landlady brought this tea-caddy to me.
Prisoner Parker. I wish to have my property before I make my defence on my trial. I went on the 20th of September to Rag-fair, with eight shillings of Mr. Gardener's in my pocket, to buy two shirts; and at the bottom of the fair I met a woman with a tea-chest and some things in her apron; she wanted to get it open; and I took her to Mrs. Grayson's, where I had a tea-caddy, that I thought the key would open it; it would not; Mrs. Grayson asked me to open it with my scissars; Mrs. Grayson took the lock under her care; and I fetched it away for six-pence the next morning; there was two guineas in it, and I believe about half an ounce of tea: I have no witnesses but Mrs. Grayson:

             is really innocent of any thing that is transacted; he was in work.

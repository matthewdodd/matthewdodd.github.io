WILLIAM STANTION
 and 



THOMAS BOFHAM
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
21st of May, 1 till, value 6d.; 2 half-crowns and 2 sixpences; the goods and monies of 



Thomas Winkup.






THOMAS WINKUP
. I came a baker, and in princes-street, Cavendish-square. I came home to my house at a quarter-past nine o'clock on the 21st of May—I saw Bofham with my till in his hand by my shop door, pouring the money into Stantons spron—I had seen my till safe at six o'clock at night—it has then about 14s. in it, in silver and half-pence—Bofham was seized by another person—I gathered some of the money up, and took the till—another person took the tow boys.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner Stanton? A. I do not know that I did—I looked after my money.





THOMAS ORRIDGE
. I live in Great Castle-street. I was returning home that evening and I saw four boys standing against my private-door—I went up to them—I saw the two prisoners cross over to the prosecutors shop—Bofham went into the shop—Stanton stood outside—Bofham brought out the till in two or three minutes—then put the money into Stantons apron, and I and my brother went and took them.





THOMAS SIMMONS
 (police-constable, 77 D.) I took the prisoners—I found one-penny, one halfpenny, and four farthings on Bofham—but nothing on Stanton.
(William Duke, shoe-maker, of Well-street, gave Stanton a good character,

and William Fletcher, scale-beam maker, Flower-and-Dean street, gave both the prisoners a good character.)

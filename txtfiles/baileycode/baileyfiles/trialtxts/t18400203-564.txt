WILLIAM MARRIOTT
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of January, 22 lbs. weight of cheese, value 12s., the goods of Henry Deane.






CHARLES SLATER
. I am shopman to Henry Deane, a cheesemonger, in Fore-street. He had some cheeses in his shop on the 22nd pf January—this is one of them—(examining one)—Emblem came and told me something—I ran out, and ran after the prisoner, and saw him in Milton-street, with the cheese on his head—I hallooed after him—he threw it down—I ran up and took it, and then ran to the court he ran up, and Hude had him by the collar, bringing him down.





HENRY EMBLEM
. I am in the employ of Mr. Tarby, in Fore-street. I was taking down my master's shutters, and saw two boys about, one of whom was the prisoner—they crossed the road—the other one went into the prosecutor's shop, and took the cheese, brought it out, and gave it to the prisoner, who went down Moor-lane, and threw it down in Milton-street.





DENNIS HUDE
. I am a constable of Cripplegate. On Wednesday, the 22nd of January, I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I ran out of my own room, and saw the prisoner running with the cheese—he threw it down—I followed, and took him.
(John Lynes, a wood-turner, of Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years,—Isle of Wight.

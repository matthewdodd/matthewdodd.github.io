            . On the 11th of September I was going along the Curtain-road


, I saw three boys playing with a flour sack; I passed them a short distance, and then my baby had a pull at the neck - I turned round and caught the prisoner at my shoulder with the beads in his hand - he had taken them off the child's neck. He ran away - I am sure he is the boy.

            . I heard the cry of stop thief - saw people running; I overtook the prisoner - took him to the prosecutrix. He said he would show me where they were. I took him back but could not find them.

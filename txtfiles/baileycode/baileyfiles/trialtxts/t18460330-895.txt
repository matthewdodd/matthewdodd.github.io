SARAH GREENWOOD
 and 




HENRIETTA WHITE
 were indicted for

stealing 1 handkerchief, value 6s., the goods of 



George Llewhelling Millard, from his person: and that they had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES BROWN
 (police-constable F 142.) On the 26th of Feb. I was in St. James's-park, about two o'clock in the afternoon—I saw both the prisoners and another female in company with them—I saw Greenwood go behind Mr. Millard and take this handkerchief, which I now produce, from his coat pocket behind—this was at the time the Queen was passing—Greenwood gave the handkerchief to White—I took hold of White, and she threw the handkerchief upon the ground—Greenwood was secured by another officer—there were two more handkerchiefs found—this one was found upon Greenwood, and this other one was thrown upon the ground by White, with this pocket-book, which is the property of Mr. Welch.





GEORGE LLEWHELLING MILLARD
. This handkerchief is my property—I had it in my pocket—I was in St. James's-park on the day the Queen went to the House of Lords, and my attention was called to the loss of my handkerchief by the officer.





JOHN CARTWRIGHT WOOD
 (police-constable E 24.) I produce a certificate from Clerkenwell Sessions of the conviction of the two prisoners—they were tried together and convicted together—(read—Convicted the 15th of July, 1845; Greenwood—confined six months; and White—three months)—the prisoners are the persons.





THOMAS KENDALL
 (police-constable S 69.) I produce a certificate of Greenwood's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted the 19th of Aug., 1844, and confined seven days)—the prisoner is the person.

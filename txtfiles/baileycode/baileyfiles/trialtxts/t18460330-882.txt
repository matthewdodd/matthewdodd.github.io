JAMES LAMONT
. I am a commander in the Royal Navy. On the afternoon of the 28th of March I was in St. Paul's Church-yard—a gentleman spoke to me, and I looked for my handkerchief, which had been in my coat pocket—I found it was gone—I saw the prisoner in custody, and saw it taken from his breast—this is it.

Prisoner. Q. Is it not possible you might have dropped it? A. It is possible, certainly—I did not feel you at my pocket.





FREDERICK WILLIAM LAWRENCE
. I live at No. 18, White Conduit-grove. I was passing the captain and another gentleman, who were walking arm-in-arm in St. Paul's Church-yard—I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from the captain's pocket and put it into his breast—I followed him across Cheapside and took him.

Prisoner. I picked up the gentleman's handkerchief; I saw it lying upon the ground. Witness. I was close to him—I am sure he did not pick it up—it was his taking it out of the pocket attracted my attention.





WILLIAM NORTON
 (City police-constable, No. 286.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted the 10th of June, 1844, having been before convicted of felony, confined twelve months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

WILLIAM MASON
. I am a seaman, and belong to the Ann, a north-country ship On Monday last I fell in with the prisoner at Wapping—it was towards evening—I was a little tipsy, but I knew perfectly well what I was about—we were walking together, and got into conversation—we went into a public-house—I had just changed a sovereign, and had 15s. 9d. in my breeches pocket—after we left the public-house, we were going down Nightingale-lane—she was on my left side—she slipped her hand into my pocket very quickly, and before she got it out I clapped my

hand upon it, and asked what she was doing—I told her to return the money, or I would call a police-officer—she would not return it—I had my hand on her hand—she said she would not give it me—I called the policeman, who came up immediately, and found the 15s. 9d. in her hand.

Prisoner. Q. When I came on shore at Execution Dock, did you not come to me and ask me to have something to drink? Witness. I was not there at all; I was in Wapping.





FRANCIS ULLISTHORNE
 (police-constable H 169.)I was on duty on Monday evening at half past eight o'clock—the prisoner and prosecutor came over the bridge, and turned into Nightingale-lane—they got a little way down, and stopped a minute, and he said to her, "Give me my money?"—she said, "I have not got your money"—I asked what it was—he said, "This woman has picked my pocket, I give her in charge"—I got hold of her hand and said, "What have you got here?" she said, "That is my money, there is six or seven shillings, I do not know which" I found three half-crowns, six shillings, and four sixpence, two penny pieces, and two halfpence, 15s. 9d. in all—she then said she had been with some friend, a captain, who had given her the money.

Prisoner. Q. Did I not give it out of my hand? Witness. No, I had to force it out.

Prisoner's Defence. I know Captain Smith, and had been in lodgings with him—he took me down to Limehouse—I stopped there a week, till he went down to the ship—he came to me last Sunday, and went the next morn-ing to the ship—he said to me, "Come down to Black wall, and I will give you some money"—I went, and he gave me six half-crowns and four shilHogs, I bad spent sixpence out of it—I had two pints of beer, and a penny-worth of bread and cheese—I left him about half past three o'clock, and the ship has sailed—I came on shore at Execution Dock, and met this man—he treated me with a glass of gin—I gave him a drop of rum, and then we had a quartern of gin—I paid for it—I then called for a pot of half-and-half—It came away, and had not got ten yards before he came and said, "I am going with you"—I said, "No, you are not"—he said, "I have but 2s.—he was then pulling at my handkerchief, where my money was, and I took the money in my hand.

JURY to WILLIAM MASON. Q. Where did you change your sovereign? A. At the sign of the Gun at Wapping—John Alexander, from Aberdeen, is the master of my ship—I had been two weeks in London—we brought up grain, stone, and cattle.

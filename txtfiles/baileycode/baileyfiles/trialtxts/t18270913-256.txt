WILLIAM GEORGE WHITMARSH. On the 10th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in Leicester-square


, with two ladies. I felt my pocket move, turned round, and saw Downing give my handkerchief to Carty(it was safe three minutes before) and Carty gave it to some women.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see it go from you? A. No - I have not got it back.

            . I am a watchman; the prosecutor gave the prisoners into my charge, and on the way to the watch-house, Carty offered to make up for it, if the prosecutor would let him go.
DOWNING'S Defence. I was going along, and took my hat off to wipe my face, this gentleman came and accused me of picking his pocket. I said he had better call the watchman, if he suspected me - I know nothing of Carty.
CARTY'S Defence. I was going along, and the gentleman took us - I was on before the gentleman.
Carty received an excellent character.

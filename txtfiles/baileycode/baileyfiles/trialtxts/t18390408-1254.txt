JAMES POWELL
. I am in the employ of Mr. George Lamb, a jeweller in Cheapside. The prisoner came to the shop on the 6th of April, and asked for some diamond pins at 6s. 6d.—I said we had none at that price, but I showed him four imitation diamond pins—two of them were 145. each, and two of them 10s. 6d. each—he asked to look at another—I turned to get it, and he ran off with the four—I went to the door and called, "Police"—a policeman collared him two hundred yards off, and he dropped the pins.





JOHN SIMMONDS SMITH
 (City police-constable, No. 341.) I secured the prisoner about two hundred yards down Queen-street—I had seen him go into the shop, and I watched him—he ran out, and I took him—he dropped these pins.

Prisoner's Defence. It was real distress—I had been seeking employ for the last six days.





WILLIAM HAMFER
. I am a hosier. I produce a certificate of the "prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man—he broke into my house.

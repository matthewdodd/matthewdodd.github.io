ROBERT BROWN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of October, 2 handkerchiefs, value 10s., the goods of 



Charles Augustus Cantor; and 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Hannah Juliana Leach.






JAMES MALE
 (police-constable C 102.) At half-past one o'clock on Sunday morning I was on duty in Crown-court—I saw the prisoner and two others creating a disturbance—I was told to take them—the prisoner ran away—I pursued him, and took him—I saw him drop two handkerchiefs, one at a time—these are them—(looking at them.)





ELIZABETH NEW
. I am the wife of Charles New. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run past—I followed him—I will not say that I saw him drop any thing, but I picked up a handkerchief, which Mr. Beresford, the inspector, has.





CHARLOTTE CAROLINE CANTOR
. I am the wife of Charles Augustus Cantor—he is a merchant, and lives in Montague-square. These handkerchiefs are mine and my servant's—I lost them out of my house on the 10th of October—they were in the hall, and had just returned from the washerwoman—I came home that evening—there was a man standing there, and the linen was in the hall—a lady and gentleman came home at the time I did, and it being a lodging-house I did not take notice of it—I went up stairs.





THOMAS WELLS
 (police-sergeant C 1.) I produce two handkerchiefs which I received from Mace.




GUILTY.* Aged 22.—

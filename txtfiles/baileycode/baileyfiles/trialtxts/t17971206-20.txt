                   BAILEY
               



             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: I let the first floor of our house to the prisoner, on the 16th of September last, at a guinea a week, she came in that morning after ten o'clock; she came there as a captain Wilson's wife, from Yarmouth; she said, she had come that morning to the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, at seven o'clock, by the Yarmouth coach; that captain Wilson was to be in town on the Friday, that he was to come in his own vessel, and she could not travel by water, she came by land carriage; she desired to have a pair of sheets aired, and a bed made, as soon as possible, she had been travelling two nights, and was very much fatigued; I sent my servant for the sheets, and put them to the fire immediately; she asked if I would be kind enough to let her sit down by the fire; I said there was none but in the kitchen; after she had sat down about a quarter of an hour in the kitchen, she begged to have a card of our address to leave at Charing-cross, that captain Wilson might know where to find her, she went out and returned about one o'clock, she might be gone about half an hour, or something better; she desired me to get her a bason of soup, and a threepenny-loaf; I gave four shillings and sixpence for a sack of coals and sixpenny-worth of wood; the servant went to the Spring-garden Coffee-house and got a bason of soup, and a threepenny loaf, she took up with it a silver table-spoon; after she had eat part of the soup, she went into the bed-room, as we thought, to go to bed; while she was in the bed-room, the girl went three times into the diningroom to see how the fire was; we heard nothing more of her till, as near as I can recollect, about five o'clock; she came down stairs from the diningroom to the top of the kitchen stairs, and called the servant, she told her she was going out to order some things in, and desired she would take them in when they came; I went to the kitchen stairs, and desired her to let the servant go as she felt so much fatigued; she told me, no, she was obliged to go out herself, and desired the kettle might be got boiling, and the tea-things carried up, by six o'clock; she then left the house, having been there about half an hour; the servant went up to see how the fire was, and the dining-room door was locked, she came down and told me the door was locked; she did not return at six o'clock, and when seven o'clock came, I was very much alarmed; I sent the girl to the Golden-cross, to know if a person of the name of Wilson, captain Wilson's wife, had come with the coach that morning, and to know if she had left a card of our address there, that the captain might know where to find her; she brought word, for the answer, that there were only two gentlemen came in the Yarmouth coach that morning; and by the time the girl returned, captain Leicester, that lodged in the parlour, came in, and we tried to open the door, and could not; we got a ladder, and got in at the window, backwards; we found a pair of sheets gone, and a counterpane, a tablespoon, and the key of the door; by the time we had done it it was almost eight o'clock; I sent for my husband, and we went to Bow-street, and gave information; I called at Mr. Salkeld's, the pawnbroker, the corner of Bedford-street, and two others, but nothing had been pawned of that kind then; in the evening, the pawnbroker at the corner of Bedford-street, came to tell me his young man had recollected taking in these things, at six o'clock that evening; I described her dress, and her person, and he said, it was exactly the person I had described; she had pawned them in my name, and told them that she was the mistress of the house, that she kept the house; the next morning I went to Bow-street, and informed them we had found some things; they told me, at Bow-street, that unless I found the person I must take the things out, and pay a guinea for them, that they had advanced; I saw no more of her till the 29th of November, I was going up to Newport-market, and at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, there is a woollen-drapers, she saw me, she ran up a court, and I went after her, seeing me coming after her, she returned; I asked her if she did not know me; she told me she did not, that she had never seen me before; I told her I was confident she had; she asked me when; I told her I thought she could recollect where as well, as I could tell her; I told her if I must have the trouble to tell her, that I was the person where she took the table-spoon, and the counterpane, and sheets from, in Northumberland-street; she told me I had mistook the person; I told her I was confident to her person; she said, if I took her up, she wouldtake me up; I told her I should not take her up myself, but if she offered to stir till I had assistance, I should cry stop thief; she told me, she would not be detained in the street; there was a great mob of people gathered round; I desired a young man that was there to get somebody to take the prisoner, for she had robbed me; he brought the beadle of the parish, and they took her down to the watch-house, and from thence to Bow-street, where she was examined; my servant girl went to Bow-street, and she knew her as soon as ever she saw her; when she was searched, she had two guineas and a half in gold in her pocket, six shillings and six-pence in silver, and three shillings in halfpence and farthings, and a great number of duplicates, but not the duplicate of the spoon.
Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You never saw the person of the prisoner before the time she came to your house? - A. No.
Q. She sat in the kitchen? - A. A quarter of an hour.
Q. Had you any conversation with the gentleman in the parlour? - A. No, nothing particular.
Q. Did you never say that you supposed it was a man in woman's clothes? - A. I said, I thought so; because she was such a large featured woman, but I am sure she is the person.
Q. How do you know that she was gone about half an hour? - A. I saw her go.
Q. Then you or your servant saw her all the time? - A. I do not know.
Q. The spoon was there when she returned at one o'clock? - A. Yes.
Q. Your servant made the bed, between the time of her leaving the house, and coming home, at one o'clock? - A. Yes.
Q. Have not you a great many lodgers? - A. No.
Q. You are not very nice in your lodgers, I see, to take people without characters? - A. I told her, I wished to have some account of her.
Q. Did you see her when she came back again at one o'clock? - A. No; the girl did.
Q. But you yourself did not know who that was? - A. No.
Q. How long do you think it was, before the person who went up stairs, quitted the house again? - A. About five o'clock, as near as I can tell; I saw her go out myself.
Q. You did not see the person? - A. Yes, I did.
Q. At what hour did the pawnbroker state the things were pawned? - A. Six o'clock, as near as I can recollect.
Q. You have, probably, more sheets, and more counterpanes, and more spoons in the house? - A I have; the counterpane I am certain to, it has my mark upon it.
Q. If any person stopped you in the street, mistaking you, you would not have liked it? - A. I should not have minded, if I had known myself innocent; I am certain to her person, she said, at Bow-street, that she was in Ireland at that time.
Q. Then you do not know precisely, whether she was in the house on the 5th or not? - A. To the best of my knowledge she was.

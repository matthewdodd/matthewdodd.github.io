            . On the 17th of February, in the afternoon, about half an hour after four, I was in Cheapside: going towards Cheapside-Conduit, a little before I got to Woodstreet


, I felt something at my pocket; the prisoner at the same time turned round. I saw no body near me but him: I said, Friend, you have picked my pocket, and took hold of him; he fell a crying, and begged I would let him go, and said he had not. I took him into an alley. A gentleman came to know what was the matter. Somebody went for a constable. In the interim the prisoner dropt my handkerchief in the channel, in the dirt. It was picked up and delivered to the constable. (Produced and deposed to.)

            . I saw the prosecutor have the prisoner by the collar, accusing him with stealing his handkerchief; the prisoner shewed him one; the prosecutor said, that was not his. A gentleman said, The prisoner has dropt it: it was taken up from under his feet in the channel.

Prisoner's Defence.
The gentleman took me down an alley. I never had the handkerchief. I am a weaver
 by trade.

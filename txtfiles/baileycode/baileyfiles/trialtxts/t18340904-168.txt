HENRY PETER EMANS. I live at No. 322, Strand. On the 29th of July, I was in Fleet-street


, opposite St. Bride's - I felt something at my right hand pocket - I turned and saw the prisoner in the act of putting my handkerchief into his right hand pocket - he said, "I did not take it from you"- I said, "I do not say you did, but you have it."
Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Were there no persons between you? A. There might be - I was passing up Fleet-street, about half-past two o'clock in the day - I am sure it is mine - I held the prisoner till the officer came.

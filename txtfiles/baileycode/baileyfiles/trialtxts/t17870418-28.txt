            , Esq. sworn.
On Saturday, the 3d of March, as I was going down Fish-street Hill


, a person tapped me on the shoulder; and I turned round, and saw he had hold of the prisoner by the collar; at his feet lay this handkerchief; I took him into the constable's house; he said to the prisoner, I have warned you of this several times.
SAMUEL MABS sworn.
I am a victualler; I was coming down Fish-street Hill; I stopped to speak to a butcher; he said, do you not see how busy the pick pockets are? them two men are after that gentleman, and I will be after them; I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Smith's pocket, and pull out a handkerchief; I took the prisoner by the collar, and he dropt the handkerchief; I then touched Mr. Smith on the shoulder, and said, you have lost your handkerchief; Mr. Smith looked at it, and said, this is my handkerchief; I picked it up myself off the curb stone.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I had been looking for work at a tobacconist's, and upon Fish-street Hill. I had been at another tobacconist's; and there was a tall jockey, who might have picked the gentleman's pocket, who threw the handkerchief at me, and the man Mabs took me.

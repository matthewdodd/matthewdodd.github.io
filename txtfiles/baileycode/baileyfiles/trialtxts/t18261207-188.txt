. The prisoner worked for us, and, on the 31st of October, I detected him in a shop in a Rathbone-place, with this horse-hair - we had seen him take it out of his breeches, and put it into his apron, as he went along - we deal in hair of this description; I went into the shop, and said, "This is mine," and gave him in charge - he made no answer.

            . I work for the prosecutors - master followed the prisoner, and saw him move the hair from his bosom or his breeches - he went into the shop, and took him.

            . My husband keeps a rag-shop in Upper Rathbone-place. The prisoner came in on the 31st of October - I had seen him once before - he put this hair into the scale; I said, "This is short and soft; I cannot sell it;" he said, "If you untwist it, you won't find it short;" the prosecutor came in and claimed it.

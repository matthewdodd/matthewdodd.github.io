EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE
, Esq. I am member of Parliament for Halifax—my estate was at Turnwood, in Dorsetshire—I have lately sold it—in 1845, during the season, I resided in John-street, Berkeley-square—I had previously resided in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square—when I left John-street I had some articles of furniture—I arranged with my valet to leave them on the first and second floors of his house, and I was to make use of that lodging until I got a new house—in Nov., 1845, having left my valet in the country, I hired the prisoner temporarily for the job as valet—he went out of town with me—I resided at the house of my aunt at Exeter, and afterwards at Cheltenham—I staid at my father's house there, and then came to London for a day, and then we went down to Turnwood—he was with me one month from some time in Nov. until Dec.—we returned to town together—I returned with my regular valet—the prisoner had his account paid at Turnwood, and parted with me at the Nine Elms station—I lost sight of him for some months, except seeing him once or twice in the street, I heard nothing of him for three

months, I believe—I had delivered to me at the Traveller's Club, two or three, or perhaps four, small notes from him, requesting the loan of 1l. or 2l.—I immediately destroyed them—I paid no attention to them—as well as my memory serves me I saw him in the street afterwards, and said I was surprised he did not know better than to write to me for assistance at the Traveller's Club, that any servant, however short a time he had been with me, ought to know that he should apply at my lodgings—about July last he called on me at my lodgings at Cottage-road, Chester-square—I do not remember what part of the month it was—I should say it was the end of July—I had some conversation with him—I do not think Sir George Hamilton's name was mentioned—he asked me for assistance, which I declined, alleging that I thought an able, smart, and active servant ought to have got a place if he chose, and I was displeased with his having written another letter to the Traveller's Club asking for a small sum of money, after I had forbidden letters to be sent there—I met him in the street in Aug. as I was going to the House of Commons—nothing was said on that occasion about Sir George Hamilton—he asked me to give him a written character—I said, "As long ail am in London any gentleman who pleases to apply to me will hear whit I have to state, that you have lived with me a month or six weeks, and, as far as I know, are a decent, respectable servant, I rather object to giving a written character; I will think of the matter"—while he was staying with me I rather believe I inadvertently gave him reason to suppose I had more power of getting him a place than I really had—he says so, and it seemed to be impressed on his mind—I forget how it arose—I said, "When a gentleman, a friend of mine, returns from abroad, if you are a good coachman or groom it may be in my power to recommend you, and I will do so"—Sir George Hamilton at that time was abroad—on the 3rd of Sept. he called on roe for a written character—I was in the act of writing it when he called to ask for it—he was bad up into the room—I delivered the character into his hands—this is it—it is dated 3rd September—(read—"James Newbery was engaged by me last winter to wait on me during my valet's absence. He served me at my then house in the county of Dorset, and travelled with me to Halifax, and when there be always conducted himself with perfect propriety, honesty, and sobriety during the two months he was with me, and I should think would make a superior and valuable servant—EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE, Cottage-road.") It in mistake about Halifax—at the time I wrote it I was under the impression that he had been with me longer than he was—I was anxious to give bio the benefit of the best testimony I could, having learned from him my character would be of considerable importance to him, as his late master bid failed and was out of the way—I made the best character I could—he received the character, and I was very much surprised that he did not thank me for it—he complained that I had not got him the situation with my friend, and I think he said I had recommended somebody else, that I had hired all Sir George Hamilton's servants, and one word from me could have got him a place, and that I had also bought his horses—my answer was that I had new hired a single servant for that gentleman, that unquestionably I had been ready to recommend him, but it was a question whether I could recommend him since that period, that I had given advice to the stud-groom with regard to sending horses abroad, but he might learn that I had not bought any horses for him, that Lord Villiers was the person who was employed to buy them—he repeated the same statement, doggedly adhering to his assertion—that gave me the impression that he was endeavouring to pick a quarrel, or that he was not in his right mind—(I have condensed the conversation)—as he went out of the room he said something, the meaning of which I could hardly understand,

but which received its explanation from his subsequent conduct—he stood with the door half between him and me—he said, "I shall call at the Travellers'," or something of the sort—I think I went out of town, and did not go to the Travellers' that day—on the next day, the 4th, this letter was brought to me from the Travellers' Club—I believe it is the prisoner's writing—he has stated that it was—(read—" Sept, 4th, 1846. Sir, I feel very much disappointed in not having the place with Sir George Hamilton, after having promised me; I should have thought, after what has passed between me and you, you would have got me the place; I shall go to the club, or clubs, which you belong to, and tell them what you are, which I can prove; I shall likewise let your father and mother know what you are, and likewise the public, and if you do not do something for me I shall acquaint a lawyer of it; you know very well what you wanted me to do to you; it is right the public should know who are these persons; you said that if I left my mistress you would do something for me; you have driven me to do what I have done, and you have acted very unhandsome to me; I can return to you, and if you do not answer by return of post I shall tell the committees of the clubs which you belong to, and if you like to vin-dicate yourself I am to be found in Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's; certainly I shall disgrace you; my address is, 'James Newbery, at Mr. Collins's, Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's' ")—on the receipt of that letter, (I am not very clear as to the dates,) as I was going out at that time, I took the name and direction down, and left the note at home—on my return from the City I stepped into Brooks's-club, and wrote a letter to him, which I did not send, because I thought I would condense it—I afterwards wrote this letter—I accidentally retained the draft of it—(read)—
" 12, Cottage-road, Chester-square, Sept. 4, 1846.
"Some one has written, in James Newbery's name, a threatening letter to Mr. Davis Protheroe. Mr. Davis Protheroe cannot believe that the letter is written by James Newbery. The letter is sent to Mr. Davis Protheroe's lawyer, who has orders to prosecute the writer, if necessary. Probably the letter is written to gain the benefits of a prison, or of transportation—one of which would certainly follow a prosecution; if this be the case, the writer's wish will not be gratified, as Mr. Davis Protheroe will treat this and all other letters with perfect indifference, and the writer may take what course he likes: it will not have any effect on Mr. Davis Protheroe. Mr. Davis Protheroe does not believe it comes from James Newbery, as only yesterday morning he received what alone he asked for—a letter of recommendation, testifying his good conduct when on a job in Mr. Davis Protheroe's service; and James Newbery only expressed some disappointment that he had not got a place as coachman to Sir George Hamilton; on which he heard, from Mr. Davis Protheroe, that he had never hired one servant for Sir George Hamilton, and had recommended James Newbery in the winter, when he thought he might suit the place. There being, therefore, no assignable reason, nor motive, for such an act, Mr. Davis Protheroe cannot believe the letter comes from James Newbery, who must be simply mad, if he wrote it. Mr. Davis Protheroe's answer to the writer is, that he will pay no attention to this or any other such letter. It is a threatening letter: threatening letters are punishable with im-prisonment or transportation, and nothing else will they ever get.—EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE. P.S. Mr. Davis Protheroe bad mentioned to James Newbery that letters should be sent to his house, and not to the Travellers' Club, out of kindness, as he thought it only creditable and respectable for a servant to seem to have the power of calling on a gentleman at his house. It is no annoyance (if annoyance is intended) for letters to be left at clubs: they

are often lost, and the writer is the sufferer. Mr. Davis Protheroe's intention seems to have been misunderstood, and his good-will thrown away,—To James Newbery."

MR. PROTHEROE
re-examined. On the next day, the 5th of Sept., the prisoner was shown into my room, very much to my surprise—I said, "Have you received a letter from me, in answer to one which you wrote to me?"—he said he had not—I said, "I have got a copy of it; I am in a very great hurry, and have scarcely time to say a single word; perhaps the best way is to read what I have written, unless you should not receive it"—I read the draft to him—I cautioned him not to interrupt me, as I was in a very great hurry-while I was reading the passage about my power to get him a situation, which is longer than in the letter, he repeated the assertion, that it was in my power by a word to get him a situation—I thought he really was not in his senses on the subject—before he left the room he said, it was all very well when a man was in prosperity and well to do, people were his friends, but in adversity or poverty no one would give him a guinea, and he would serve me out as well as other persons—I said, "Whatever other persons have done to you I have discharged my duty to you as a gentleman and a master"—he said I had behaved in a very ungentlemanly manner to him—I said I must decline saying further—I rose and left, and he left the house—I left town on the 7th or 8th (I think I left to go to Richmond, I left the very night I wrote the letter)—I received this letter just before I left my lodgings to go to Cheltenham—it is in the same handwriting as the one which he acknowledges—(read—" To E. D. Protheroe, 12, Cottage-road, Chester-square, Pimlico. Sir,—I have now done what I stated to you I should do: that is, I have wrote to one of the committee, which is Captain C. C. Berkeley, and told him my address, if he wished to see me, to state further particulars.—JAMES NEWBERY."—I staid a few days at Cheltenham-when I returned I was prepared, at that moment, to go abroad—I had my passport ready, but I received this letter, which arrested my progress—I wish, in reference to the last letter which was read, to state, that in the conversation I had with him, he muttered something about writing to Mr. Berkley and the Travellers' Club—(read)—" To the Gentlemen of the Travellers' Club. I wish to inform you, E. D. Protheroe is guilty of that crine which is forbidden by God and man; I also consider it my duty to let the members know what sort of a man he is, for the short time I was with him I have convincing proofs of E. D. Protheroe; it is well known the steward of the other club which he belongs to lost his place, through accusing him of an unnatural offence, which I can prove he is guilty of; I sent him a letter on Thursday of what I intended to do, and what I have now stated in this letter; I hope the gentlemen of the club will take into consideration what sort of company they are in; if he E. D. P. likes to take me up, I am to be found at Mr. Collins's, Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's"—on the next day I came to town late in the evening, and lost not a moment in ascertaining whether my solicitor was in London, and put the matter in his hands—on my solemn oath there is not a particle of truth in the assertions the prisoner has made against me.

The prisoner cross-examined the witness at great length, respecting different acts of familiarity and indecency having taken place between them, all of which the witness solemnly denied.






THOMAS STEVENSON
. I am valet to Mr. Protheroe, and have been in his service twenty years—I am a married man—I was married last year—I was down at Mr. Protheroe's house at Turnwood when he brought the prisoner as a temporary servant.






WILLIAM HILLIARD
. I am porter at the Traveller' Club—I know the prisoner. In Sept. last he brought a letter to the club for Mr. Protheroe—I do not recollect the date—I think it was in the early part of the month—the letter was conveyed to Mr. Protheroe's house, or delivered to a servant of his—at the time he brought the letter, I think he remarked that Mr. Protheroe had not performed a promise that he had made to him, which was obtaining him a situation with Sir George Hamilton—I saw him several times afterwards—he came and asked questions as to who the committee of the club were—I handed him a list of the club—he looked it over, and selected two names—one was Captain Barclay, and the other Mr. T. P. Courtenay—ha said from the disappointment he had received from the non-performance of Mr. Protheroe's promise, he felt so aggravated he should certainly write to those two gentlemen, and acquaint them of a certain thing respecting Mr. Protheroe, not naming what it was, but "a certain thing"—that he would be disgraced by such statement, or words to that effect—he said on one occasion, I think on that, "I am sorry I did not take the 5l.," and moreover stated that he was determined to see the thing out, and unless Mr. Protheroe satisfied him, he would disgrace him—for that the steward next door (that was the Reform Club) had lost his situation through making an accusation against Mr. Protheroe, but his was on a stronger foundation, and he should certainly follow it up unless Mr. Protheroe satisfied him—I supposed he meant some emolument—I said I thought he was acting an unwise part, that at all times a servant was placed in a weak situation against a gentleman, let it be what it might—his answer was, he was so firmly satisfied, and could so firmly establish it, he would not refrain from it unless he was, as I understood, provided for—it amounted to that.

Prisoner. I deny saying anything about making any emolument. Witness I am quite certain he said it.





EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE

re-examined, I never made any tender, or offered the prisoner 5l. on any occasion—I do not understand what he alludes to.





THOMAS PEREGRINE COURTENAY, ESQ
. I am nephew of the Earl of Devon, and am a member of the committee of the Travellers' Club. I received this letter on the 5th of Sept.—it is dated the 7th—I was aware Mr. Protheroe was a member of the club, but was not acquainted with him myself—I sent the letter to Mr. Long, a friend of Mr. Protheroe's—about the 18th of Sept., at the request of Mr. Protheroe, I sent the prisoner a letter, appointing him to call—on the day appointed he arrived at the club, and was shown into the committee-room—I asked him his name, showed him this letter, and asked whether he wrote it—he said he bad—I then read it to him, and said, "You admit that that is the letter you wrote?"—he said it was.

The prisoner in an unconnected address persisted in charging Mr. Protheroe with certain acts of indelicacy and familiarity with him, declaring the truth of all his assertions.





GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Twenty Years.


Before Mr. Justice Erle.

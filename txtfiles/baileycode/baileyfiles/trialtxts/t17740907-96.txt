            . Coming down Chick-lane


 between four and five o'clock in the afternoon on the 30th of July, I saw the prisoner flurt my handkerchief out of my pocket; I saw it in his hand; I turned round and said you rascal what do you mean by that? he ran down Black-boy-alley; I pursued him, with the cry of stop thief; he was stopped by the constable; I had lost sight of him as he turned the corner, but am sure he is the man; I do not know what became of the handkerchief, it was not upon him when he was taken.
- Land, the constable, deposed, that upon hearing the cry of stop thief, and seeing the prisoner run, he stopped him, but found nothing upon him.

I never saw the handkerchief.

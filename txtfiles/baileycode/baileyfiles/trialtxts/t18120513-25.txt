            . On the 17th of April last I was returning from our barge builders, on the south side of the river Thames, to the north side. I saw a man taking coals out of a barge.
Q. Where did the barge lay - A. About fifty yards below Mr. Wood's wharf, on the Middlesex side of the river.
Q. Was the prisoner one of the men - A. He was, it was about eight o'clock in the morning. I rowed the boat towards them. I saw one man in the barge, and the prisoner in the boat alongside of the barge.
Q. Was the man in the barge doing any thing with the coals - A. I saw the man in the barge lift a basket of coals up three times on the gunnel, the prisoner each time took the basket off the gunnel; I saw the prisoner shoot the coals out of the basket in the boat. I immediately rowed alongside of the boat, I stepped into the boat where the prisoner was in. I said to the prisoner you must go along with me immediately to our wharf, you have been taking coals out of this barge.
Q. What became of the man that was with him - A man of the name of Groves was in the head room of the barge, when I seized the prisoner the prisoner clung to the barge, to hold the boat alongside of the barge, for the other man to step into the boat. Groves came upon the gunnel of the barge, I found he wanted to get into the boat along with the prisoner. I shoved the boat off the barge; the prisoner begged very hard for me to let the other man come in. I took one scull away and immediately rowed the prisoner to Mr. Wood's wharf, and before I got to the wharf the other man that was in the barge called a boat along side and was rowed over the water. I rowed the prisoner into our dock, and sent for Mr. Wood. An officer came to take the prisoner into custody, and while the officer was there we took the coals out of the boat and put them into two sacks, these coals were the property of Messrs. Wood and Co.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            . I am a brewer's servant, I met the prisoner, she asked me if I would be be a penny with her, I said, I would. I was two-pence halfpenny, and another man, a penny; we had a pot of beer in her own apartment in Horns-Court, Petticoat-Lane


, I put my watch upon the table while I drank, there were three women in company: Booth took my watch off the table, and they handed it from one to another, till I lost it, I said, Bet, you know me very well, what do you mean by taking my watch; she said, she had not taken it, there were Booth and Burbridge and another woman that was in company; I secured one woman, that was the means of these two being taken up.

The constable examined them apart, and at length drew from them where the watch was. We took Booth to a house where they said the watch was in pledge; there we found the watch; it was in pawn for half a guinea, or some such sum.
The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.
The Prisoners in their defence said, that Smith lent them the watch to pledge, to raise a little money.
Both 

               Guilty
            .

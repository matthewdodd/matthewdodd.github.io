JAMES PRYCE. I am a druggist
. On the 28th of December, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was in Holborn, between Ely-place and Hatton-garden


, waiting for a friend, and felt a catch at my pocket; I missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw the prisoner, about two yards off with his hand in his breeches-pocket. I went up to him, and asked him what he had? He said,
"it is mine". I pulled his hand out of his pocket, and found my handkerchief there - I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.

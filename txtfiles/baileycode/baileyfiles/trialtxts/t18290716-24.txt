            . I am the daughter of

             - she is a baker
, and lives in Brick-lane


. On the 29th of June, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, there were two 5s. papers of coppers on the counter - the prisoner came in, and asked for a pint of water; I said I could not give it him - I turned my back, and he took one of the papers of halfpence and ran off; I pursued him, and called Stop thief! but lost sight of him - he was brought back in about five minutes with the halfpence; I am sure he is the same person.

            . I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running; I caught him, and the 5s. paper of halfpence dropped from him - I picked it up, and took it back to the house.

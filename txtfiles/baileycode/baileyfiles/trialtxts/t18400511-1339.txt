JOHN DAVIES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of April, 1 purse, value 1s.; 1 pocket-book, value 1s. and 5 sovereigns; the property of 



Reginald George Macdonald.






REGINALD GEORGE MACDONALD
. On the 16th of April, about half-past five o'clock, I was in the Quadrant in Regent-street, in company with Sir David Baird—I had a Russia leather pocket-book in my coat pocket, containing letters which I wished to show a friend, and in my other pocket a red silk purse containing five sovereigns—I lost them both, and they are lost entirely—I know nothing of the prisoner, only by seeing him collared by the officer.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How lately before the officer spoke to you, had you felt this property safe? A. A very few minutes, while I was in the Quadrant—Captain Peters and Captain Farley were on before me—Sir David Baird had hold of my arm—there were other persons about—the prisoner was on the same side as I was, against the rails.





HENRY TIPSTAFF
 (police-constable C 156.) I was in the Quadrant on that evening—I saw the prisoner and two others walking behind the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner feel the prosecutor's pockets outside, and then he put his hand into his pocket, and took out first a purse, and then out of the other pocket a pocket-book—he handed them to another, who passed on, and ran to Coventry-street—I ran across the road, but a wagon was passing, and before I could get across, the others got away—I could only take the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a great crowd? A. No, not on the side the prosecutor was—I told the Magistrate that I saw him take a purse out—this is my signature to this deposition—(looking at it.)
(The deposition on being read, stated that he saw the prisoner take a pocket-book, and hand it to another, but did not mention a purse.)

JAMES WILSON. I live in Saunder's-court, Great Peter-street, and am a shoe-maker
. On the 27th of November, about twelve o'clock, my watch hung on a nail in my stall, a little higher than my head; I did not see it taken. The prisoner came to my stall, pulled off his shoe, and wished me to mend it; I said I could not do it while he waited - I was giving it to him again when he returned it, and pointed out another job: I said I could not do it then; he put on his shoe, and said he would get a slipper, and bring it again. I saw a kind of shadow over my head while I was looking at the shoe, but I did not know what it was. I missed the watch half a minute after he was gone. I went to several pawnbrokers to give information - he was taken the same night. I am quite sure he is the person who came to my stall.

             I am an officer. I went in search of the prisoner, and found him by the description the prosecutor gave me - he denied the robbery, and said he lived at No. 52, Pye-street; I went there, but he did not live there.
Prisoner's Defence. I was not near his place on that day: I was at Mr. Williams's, at Chelsea.
JAMES WILSON re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner come into your stall? A. No, but he was near enough to reach the watch. The stall is under the Elephant and Castle, public-house


; persons passing by might easily see the watch hanging up.

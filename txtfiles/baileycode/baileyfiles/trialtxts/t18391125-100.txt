GEORGE RICHARDSON
. I keep a shop at Kensington. I had some knives and teapots in the window on the 14th of November—they were safe at seven o'clock in the evening when I went out, and when I returned between ten and eleven o'clock the articles stated were gone—I found them and the prisoner at the station-house—I do not know him.





JOHN EVANS
. On the evening of the 14th of November I was going up High-street, Kensington, and saw the prisoner take the things out of the prosecutor's window—he came out, and gave something to another boy, and they all ran towards London.


Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take the teapot? A. I saw you take down the guard, and take the things from the window—there was another boy outside, and you came to him.





PATRICK HAMMERSLEY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner about half-past eight o'clock that night—he was in company with two others—I found these two knives on his person, and I found the teapot the next morning close to the spot where the prisoner was taken, within the railings of Hyde-park.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Kingston fair, and as I returned I met two boys—I got talking to thorn, and when I was taken I was twenty yards a-head of them—they came running after me, and showed me the knives—I took them in my hand to see what was the value of them—the boys ran away, and the policeman took me.





JAMES SMITH
. I am a policeman—I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

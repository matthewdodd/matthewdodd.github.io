MR. PLATT
conducted the Prosecution.






JAMES WINSON
. I am a cigar maker, of 4, Doggitt-court, Moorfields. On 7th May, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Smithfield, and saw four persons close alongside of me—the prisoner was one—I saw him give a boy a blow on the side of his face—I had no sooner passed on than the prisoner snatched my bundle out of my hand; it contained bread and cheese—he ran off, and I ran after him—I caught him about twenty yards off, laid hold of the bundle, and he struck me a violent blow on the neck—I fell, and he got off with the bundle—I called an officer, and the prisoner ran away—I never lost sight of him—he dropped the bundle and the officer caught him—I am positive he is the man—this is my handkerchief (produced.)





JOHN FAUCETT
 (City policeman, 212). I ran after the prisoner, caught him in Long-lane, and received a bundle from Winson—I searched him, and found 5s. 4d. on him—I did not see him with the bundle—I have known him eighteen months or two years.

Prisoner. Q. I want to know what he has known me in? A. I have known you to be an associate of thieves, following gentlemen on market days—you were in custody at Bagnigge-wells.





WILLIAM THEOPHILUS LAMPRELL
. I am a carpenter, of 13, Long-lane. I was in Smithfield with some brasswork in my hand about 5 o'clock—as I passed the prisoner he struck me as hard as he could on the back of my head—he did not do anything to the brass—he then struck Winson and took his bundle away—Winson ran after him, and a policeman took him—I have seen him hundreds of times about Long-lane and Smithfield.

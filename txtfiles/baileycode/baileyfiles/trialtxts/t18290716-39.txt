            , a pawnbroker
 - he has one shop in Chandos-street



, the business of which I conduct. On the morning of the 16th of June the prisoner came to pawn two handkerchiefs, and about the middle of the day she came to redeem them; she said she wanted to leave a shawl she had on her shoulders for them; while we were looking at the shawl, which was refused, she took up the handkerchiefs, and left this bundle, which was done up precisely in the same manner as the handkerchiefs were - it contains some pieces of stuff, of no value; we followed her, and brought the handkerchiefs back - we knew her before.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Cameron, at his shop in the Strand. On the 15th of June the prisoner came and pawned two handkerchiefs for 4s. - in the afternoon she came to redeem them, and said she wanted to leave a shawl for 3s. 6d.; I said it would not do - she took away the parcel containing the handkerchiefs, and left this parcel, wrapped up as the handkerchiefs were, it contains a lot of rags, not worth a farthing.

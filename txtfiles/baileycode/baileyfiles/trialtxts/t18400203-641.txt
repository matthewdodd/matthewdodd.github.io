EDWIN LLEWELLIN
. I keep a cheesemonger's shop in Liquorpond-street. On the 18th of January the prisoner and a woman came in, and as they looked very suspicious, I watched them—they then went out, and the prisoner passed by several times again—at last he got on a flat outside, took a Dutch cheese, and ran off—I followed and took him—he rolled the cheese away, but I got it—this is it—(looking at it)—I tried to find the woman, but could not.




GUILTY
.* Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

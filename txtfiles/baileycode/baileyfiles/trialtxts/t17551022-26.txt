                  , privately in the warehouse
             of the said Thomas, Oct. 18
.* 
Thomas Crossland. I keep the Hungerford warehouse
 in the Strand, near Hungerford-market


, and have some warehouses in a cellar under the market. I have from time to time been very suspicious of somebody going into them, besides myself; my two vaults are one on the side of the other; and there are others have vaults there, which all go in from one common door. I believe I have now the quantity of 18 hundred gallons of spirituous liquors in them, but I never sell any wholesale, but by drams and in punch in my house. I used not to send any body there when I wanted, but went myself and fetched perhaps a couple of gallons at a time; the exciseman had several times told me I had an extreme good trade, that I must get a great deal if I used so much as he found gone out. I knew I had a tolerable good trade; but being a little suspicious, I took a broom and set it up behind the door when I came out, that it should stand within side, and fall against the door when I lock'd it. When I went the next time, I, at opening the door, put in my hand to feel for the broom and I could not find it; then I went in and found it set a considerable distance from the place; then I was certain somebody had been there besides me; after that I took a stick that I used to gauge my vessel with; it was mark'd with figures; I gaug'd the two casks on tap, and observ'd exactly the depth; by this, the next time I went, I found a deficiency of an inch in one, and an inch and half in the other.
Q. What do your casks usually hold ?
Crossland. From a hundred to a hundred and 15 gallons. I tried the broom also a second time; and when I went the next time it was gone from the door again. Thus, I have at times, guest I have lost four or five gallons out of both vessels on tap at a time. I have tried to find it out by this method of gauging, and the third and fourth times, on the 11th of this instant, I look'd upon it I had lost 1.5 gallons and upwards, from these four observations. I had also a stock-lock and a padlock, both on the door; the stock-lock did not answer well. I bought a new padlock of a particular sort, and I was told it was a very safe one; after some little time I found the new lock fail in the opening; that is, it would not open without forcing it, but it would lock very well. I was at a loss to contrive how to detect the thief. On the 11th of this instant I went down occasionally for a bottle of brandy; coming to the outward door, (that outward door used to stand open all day, and was usually lock'd in the evening;) there 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Woolf 
               



             came to me, he said, are you going down in the cellar; I said, yes, and it is a wet night, will you go down with me and drink a dram of rum; he went down and I gave him a dram, and coming up with him I went to lock the door; I ask'd him if he had got the key to lock it, I having things in my hand. We had all keys to the outward door, who had vaults within. He said, he had not his key, then I lock'd it. Something struck into my mind that this was one of the very men that robb'd me. Then I went and carry'd my bottle of brandy into York-buildings, and went and got shav'd, and return'd to the outward door. I look'd in under the door, there is a cavity that a dog may go down, and there I saw a light within the vault, with the padlock, and the bar off the outward door.
Q. How long was this after you had lock'd the door?
Crossland. It was about 20 minutes, or half an hour after; I, by looking in, saw a man like a miller, but I did not see his face; he had the lighted candle in a wooden candlestick in his hand.
Q. How look'd like a miller?
Crossland. He had meal on him?
Q. In what part of the vault was this?
Crossland. This was in the place that leads to all the cellars. Then I went to Mr. Steward's cellar, in hopes to find somebody; but finding nobody, I went to Mr. Harrison, who is steward to that estace; he lives within 50 yards of this place; I told him I was certain I had been robb'd from time to time, and bid him go and look in, and watch about, and see who brought any thing out, but not detect them; he went, what he saw he'll give an account of.
Q. Did you look any farther that night?
Crossland. No, I did not. After Mr. Harrison came and told me they were gone out, I desired him to go down with me to see what was gone.
Q. How came you not to watch at the door?
Crossland. The persons whom I suspected all knew me, and I did not want they should see me; so desired him to see what they brought up and where they lodg'd them. On the Sunday after I apply'd to captain Jones to let me have two men to put into the cellar, who sent a sergeant-major with two soldiers. I put the two soldiers into my cellar on the Monday morning; we went in at Mr. Steward's door; they were there till Saturday night, at different times; we took them out to refresh them a little in the daytime, and put them in again.
Q. Can you tell how much you have lost in all?
Crossland. I can't; but I believe I have lost ten times the quantity I have mention'd. On the 18th of October the two soldiers brought the evidence Woolf to my house; we ask'd him who were with him, he immediately declar'd who they were; I went to Mr. Fielding and he advis'd me to go immediately after the people he had impeach'd, (he had impeach'd all the prisoners at the bar.) We went and took them all up; they all denied the fact, only David Davis, he own'd he had altered a key, (producing a key, with part of the work filed away, so that it would open divers different locks.) This is the key he own'd before the justice he alter'd.
Q. Did he say for what purpose he alter'd it?
Crossland. No, he did not positively say for what purpose, but that he gave it to one of the prisoners; I believe it was to 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



            ; he said, he pick'd it out of a box of old keys, and altered it by Abraham Davis's direction.
Q. What is 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



            ?
Crossland. He is a smith.
Cross examination.
Q. How many doors are there to these vaults ?

Crossland. There is one common door that stands open all day.
Q. Do you know any thing against the prisoners of your own knowledge?
Crossland. No, I do not.
Q. How came you to go through Mr. Steward's vault to your own, when you say there was one common door to them all?
Crossland. I never went that way before that time, and the reason was, fearing if we went in at the public door our intention would have been known, and we should have been disappointed in it.
Q. Do you never sell rum by the gallon in these vaults?
Crossland. I have not for this 6 or 7 years.
Q. Who do you rent the vaults of?
Crossland. I rent them of Mr. Hatton, who has a lease of them.
Q. Have you writings drawn between you?
Crossland. I rent them by word of mouth, and pay every quarter.
Q. Was any body present when you took them?
Crossland. I don't know that there was.
Q. Have you any partner?
Crossland. No, I have not.
Q. What lock was this key alter'd for?
Crossland. It was for a padlock.
Q. Did you buy the padlock of 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



            ?
Crossland. No, I did not.
Q. Does that way go from Mr. Steward's vaults directly into yours?
Crossland. No; it goes into the common entry, not into my vault any more than the rest.
Q. What do you look upon this key to be?
Crossland. I believe the key is a picklock key; Davis must know for what intent he alter'd it.

                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             made 2 keys.
Q. Who apply'd to him to make them?
Woolf. His cousin 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             did.
Q. How do you know that?
Woolf. I was along with him at the time.
Q. What were they made for?
Woolf. To open the vaults and get the rum out of Mr. Crossland's cellar.
Q. Where are these vaults.
Woolf. They are under Hungerford-market; 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             went there and I held the candle whilst he fitted the keys.
Q. How many times did he go?
Woolf. He went twice about them.
Q. What day was it?
Woolf. I can't tell that; it was about three or four months ago.
Q. How long was it, after they were bespoke, that he brought them?
Woolf. He brought one the very next morning and delivered it to his cousin; I was present.
Q. What did he say to him when he delivered them?
Woolf. He said, I deliver these keys into your hands; don't you deliver them to any one, for I trust my life in your hands; 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             always kept them in his custody.
Q. When did he deliver him the last key ?
Woolf. He delivered that I believe the same day; the first he made he went with me and fitted it to the lock; it would not do, and he was forced to make another.
Q. How fitted it to the lock?
Woolf. He had a file with him and fil'd it.
Q. How soon after did you make use of the key that would do?
Woolf. The very next morning, about five or six o'clock.
Q. When was this?
Woolf. I don't remember the time; it is about 4 months ago.
Q. Who was present when you open'd the vault where the rum was?
Woolf. 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             and Abraham were.
Q. How did you get in the common entry?
Woolf. I open'd the outside door with my master's key.
Q. Who is your master?
Woolf. Mr. Hide in Hungerford-market, he had cyder vaults there, and I always kept the key of the outward door.
Q. Did you carry any rum away at that time?
Woolf. 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             had a cask of about five or six gallons away with him.
Q. Who drew the rum out?
Woolf. Sometimes one, and sometimes the other; we put the small vessel under the cock; when they went away Abraham Davis lock'd the door, and I staid behind.
Q. What did they do with the rum?
Woolf. I don't know.
Q. Had you any part or profit of it?
Woolf. No, I had not; I don't know whether it was sold or not. The next we got might be in the same week; sometimes we took twice and sometimes three times a week; 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             used always to go with me.

Q. What did you do with it?
Woolf. We used to drink it.
Q. When did 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Doyle 
               



             go with you?
Woolf. He did not go the first nor the second time; he knew it I believe within about a fortnight or three weeks after the key was made, and he went with us as soon as he knew it.
Q. How much did he use to take at a time?
Woolf. Sometimes more and sometimes less; we used to take about two or three bottles each, and so share it; we could never go in without 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



            , for he always kept the key.
Q. What did you do for bottles?
Woolf. We used to carry bottles with us, and so draw it off.
Q. What quantity do you think Doyle took away?
Woolf. I can't say what quantity; he took rum away a great many times; sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three quarts; sometimes he lock'd the outward door.
Q. How many times was he there?
Woolf. I can't tell.
Q. Was he there a dozen times?
Woolf. I think he was that, if not more.
Q. Are you certain he took away a dozen bottles?
Woolf. I dare say he did, and more; besides what we took away at the same time.
Q. How much do you think you all three took away?
Woolf. I can't say justly.
Council. Do you think you took five or six dozen?
Woolf. To be sure we took more than that, from the beginning to the end. About five or six weeks ago only Abraham Davis was with me, we stole 40 gallons, in two 20 gallon vessels, at two different times, we drew it off with a crane, one about three or four days after the other, 20 gallons each time. 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             brought it out of the cellar, after which I helped it on his back, about 11 or 12 o'clock at night, and he lock'd the door and carried it to Mr. Frolick his master, in Hungerford-market. I sold it him.
Q. Did you go with him?
Woolf. No, I did not, but I believe he put it down in the vault, he said to me, he told his master he got it from on board a ship.
Q. What did you sell it for?
Woolf. He sold the first cask for 6 s. a gallon, he received six pounds for it, and gave me three pound of it; 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             nor 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Doyle 
               



             had no part of the money. The other 20 gallons I help'd on his back, he lock'd the door, and sold it to his master, for aught I know, but told me he was not paid for that, and said he told him he had that from on board a ship. The next time was two or three days after, that then Thomas Doyle, 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



            , and I, went down in the vault, this was last Saturday was se'nnight, about seven or eight at night, we got in by the same false key as we always did before, and took 3 bottles each.
Q. Where had you the bottles?
Woolf. We carried them empty with us, and drew off nine bottles full of rum, we came away and fastened the door as before. 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             and I went the next Saturday following, which was last Saturday in the morning, it was between five and six o'clock, then we opened the door with the same false key, he unlock'd the rum cellar door. I went in order to get rum as before, I was taken by two soldiers, and he ran away.
Q. Was Doyle or 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             with you at that time?
Woolf. No, neither of them.
Cross examination.
Q. Was you by when the key was alter'd?
Woolf. I was, 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             alter'd it in our vault.
Q. How did he alter it?
Woolf. With a file.
Q. Are you sure it was 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             that altered it?
Woolf. I am, it was him, and nobody else.
Q. Do you know Mr. Downs?
Woolf. I do.
Q. Had you any conversation with him about Doyle?
Woolf. No.
Q. Whether or no did you declare to him that Doyle was as innocent as any man in the world?
Woolf. No, never.
Q. Do you know Mr. Wooley?
Woolf. No, I do not.


                  George 
                  Frolick 
               



            . I believe about a month ago my servant 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             told me, he had a friend arrived in a ship from abroad, who had got some very good rum, and it was landed, and if I wanted any he'd get me some. I said, I wanted some to give away to porters, he said it would be six shillings per gallon. I said, bring me some, he brought me a 20 gallon cask, for which I paid him 6 l. About eight days after, he came and told me there was more rum come on shore, and ask'd me if I'd have any more. I said, I did not want a great deal, he brought me 20 gallons more. I gave him four guineas in part. I gave the money before he brought me the rum, to go and meet the man with it, as he pretended at Deptford, and last Saturday Mr. Crossland came, and told me he had discovered a thing that would be of service to both himself and me. I went with him to his house, there was Woolf taken, who said, my man was concerned with him. I said, I had bought 40 gallons of rum of my man. I had trusted him with my vaults and did not suspect him to be a thief, I went with Mr. Crossland to the justice, when Woolf made his information.
Q. Did you hear 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             say any thing?
Frolick. I heard him say he had either made or altered a key. I think it was he alter'd it.
Q. By whose direction ?
Frolick. At first he said by Woolf's direction.
Q. Did you see a key produced there?
Frolick. I did, it was the key that was produced, said to be taken in the vault door, belonging to Mr. Crossland, by two soldiers; they said it was a key that would open any lock almost.
Cross examination.
Q. Where did you buy this rum?
Frolick. My man told me he'd bring me some rum, and he brought it to my house.
Q. How long has 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             lived with you?
Frolick. He has lived with me a year and quarter.
Q. How has he behaved for honesty ?
Frolick. I have trusted him with my liquor, and I have sent him to the Bank of England, he has brought me home divers sums of money, and never embezzled any.
Court to prosecutor. Look at this key. (He takes the false key in his hand.)
Prosecutor. This key has opened my padlock in the presence of a number of gentlemen.


                  Thomas 
                  Harison 
               



            . Mr. Crossland gave me a hint that he had lost goods about a fortnight ago, he said he suspected this evidence Woolf to be one concerned. On the Saturday following he came to my house, and said, now I b elieve they are at it at this time. I wish you would come and assist me, for if I go about the place they'll suspect my watching them, and so I shall not catch them. I went to the cellar door about eight o'clock that evening, the door was shut but not lock'd up. I saw a light down at the bottom. I pulled the door an inch or two open, and saw a light going backwards and forwards, presently I saw the lower parts of two men, that is two pair of legs, and higher, one of them was in a lightish dress. I stood there some time, presently I saw them shake hands together, then one of them came up, that was the prisoner Doyle, he had a glass bottle in his hand. I took no notice of him, or he of me.
Q. Who was the other?
Harison. I don't know who it was. I ran home thinking Mr. Crossland was there, to tell him what I had seen, but he was not there. I returned, and then the outward doors were shut up and lock'd, and the evidence Woolf and Doyle were standing near them. I heard Doyle say to Woolf, Have you done it? if you have not, I'll come and lend you a hand.
Q. Where was this?
Harison. This was in the street.
Q. How far is your house from that place where they stood ?
Harison. It is as far off as it is cross the Sessions-house yard.
Q. Did you, when you returned, observe the bottle in Doyle's hand.
Harison. No, I did not. I only walked on, not to give them the least suspicion that I was looking after them. I then went to Mr. Crossland, and told him what I had seen, then we went to Mr. Steward's, to ask leave to go his way into the vaults, because they thought to open the great doors would carry a suspicion.
Q. Did you see Woolf after he was taken?
Harison. I was at the prosecutor's house, and after I had mentioned to him, that I saw him and Doyle there that night, then he said Abraham Davis persuaded him into it, and said, he would procure him a man to make him a key to let him in, and that was a smith named 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



            , and that he lived in Red-lion passage, near Red-lion square.
Q. Did you hear 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             acknowledge any thing?
Harison. I did hear him acknowledge he had altered a key, but who he had it of, whether the kinsmen or Woolf, I am not sure.
Q. Do you know what key was meant?
Harison. I believe it was the same key that Mr. Crossland produced here.
Q. Who did

             say came to him?
Harison. I believe it to be Woolf, but he said he never was down in the vault, but Woolf said he was down twice in the vault.

Cross examination.
Q. How long have you known Doyle?
Harison. I have known him, I believe, near a year.
Q. How near was you to Doyle, when he came up out of the vault?
Harison. I was within two yards of him.
Q. Could you see him, so as to know him?
Harison. I could, there was a candle behind him.

            . I am a soldier; Mr. Crossland apply'd to my captain, and he gave the other soldier and I directions to go to his house. We went there on Sunday was se'nnight at night; he told us he had been robb'd of several quantities of rum, but could not tell the whole. We were plac'd in the vault at 4 o'clock on the Monday morning the 13th, and continued there till about six on Saturday morning. We were out at times for three or four hours for refreshment at the middle of the day. On Saturday morning the 18th, about 6 o'clock, I was in the vault standing behind a punshion of rum; my partner was also in the vault, but was laid down backwards to go to sleep. I saw a light and heard the vault locks undo; after the locks were undone, the man went back again to the door, I suppose to call the other; he came again in about two minutes, and came into the vault; there I took him; it was

             the evidence.
Q. In what vault do you mean?
Robertson. I mean Mr. Crossland's rum vault. There was another, for I heard somebody come talking as they came along, but I saw nobody but him; but after I shut the door I heard the other run along the passage back again. I call'd up my partner; then I took this key, that has been here produc'd, out of the lock, by which they enter'd; then we took Woolf out, and lock'd the door, and I put the key in my pocket, and brought him to Mr. Crossland's house. I went before the justice with Woolf, there I saw the other three prisoners. This key was produc'd there before the justice.

                  Davis 
               



             was ask'd if that was the key which he made; he said, it was a key which he had alter'd.
Q. Who did he say he alter'd it for?
Robertson. I think he said, it was for his cousin 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



            , and that he delivered it into his own hand.
Q. Did he say for what purpose he alter'd it?
Robertson. He did not, as I heard.

            's defence.
I leave it to my council.
Court. Your council can't make your whole defence, and if you have any thing to say to the fact give an account of that now.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say farther, but that I was drawn in by this Woolf. I have gentlemen to my character.

                  Davis 
               



            's defence.
Woolf came to my shop two months ago and bespoke a key; I bid one of my men do it according to directions; he told me he wanted an old key; I open'd a large trunk and gave him one; he said, if you'll open the ward to and so, this key will do. He staid there whilst it was done, and gave the men a pot or two of beer, and carried it away along with him. I never was in his company before or since in my life.
Doyle's defence.
I am innocent of the affair. One of my neighbour's said to Woolf. How could you accuse an innocent man? Woolf said, I would not have done it, but for Mr. Harrison, who said I must do it.
For Doyle.

                  Downs 
               



            . I know Doyle and Woolf also. I was in company with Woolf when they came out from the justice's; I went into the public-house where they were, call'd the Barley-mow. I was backwards with 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



             and Doyle; somebody came backwards and said, there is 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Woolf 
               



             in the fore-room. I went and sat down by him, and said, Joe, is it not very hard you should swear so positive against an innocent man, as I think he is ? he said, he should never have mention'd his name, or brought it into the question, if Mr. Harison had not spoke about him? I said, did 
               
                  Tom 
                  Doyle 
               



             ever receive any money that the rum was sold for; he said, not a farthing?
Q. Did you ask him whether Doyle was innocent or guilty?
Downs. No, I did not. I look'd upon Woolf as a scoundrel, and went away from him.
Q. What are you?
Downs. I am a cooper, and live in the neighbourhood.

Q. Was there or was there not any conversation between him and you, relating to Doyle?
Downs. No; I said no more to him, nor he to me.
Q. How long have you known Doyle?
Downs. I have known him about a year and a half, he bears an excellent character among all the neighbours.
Cross examination.
Q. Was you before the justice?
Downs. I was.
Q. Who went with the prisoners to the public-house?
Downs. I don't know.
Q. Were they committed?
Downs. They were.
Q. Then, did they go to the public-house afterwards by themselves?
Downs. I spoke to nobody else.
Q. Who was in company?
Downs. There was a man standing upright, I took him to be the keeper.
Q. What is Doyle?
Downs. He is servant to a corn-factor in Hungerford-market.
Q. Did you ever hear he was a miller?
Downs. I have heard say he was once servant to 'squire Thrale over the water.
Q. What do you look upon his employment to be?
Downs. I believe it is in the mill.

            . I have known Doyle three years.
Q. What is his general character?
Hardingsworth. His general character is very good, so far as ever I knew of him; I would trust him as far as a hundred or a thousand pounds.
Q. Would you if he was acquitted of this?
Hardingsworth. I would trust him with any thing; he is an honest man I believe.

            . I carry on the corn trade; Doyle has liv'd with me betwixt one and two years; he works my mill. I always look'd upon him as an honest man; he boarded in my house and kept tolerable good hours. He has been a faithful servant; he was intrusted with the stock of the mills; I consided intirely in him; he has received money often for me, and I always found him faithful.

            . I am a corn-chandler; I have known Doyle about a year and a quarter.
Q. What is his general character?
Crooker. I dealt with his master; he used to measure corn betwixt us, and I have measured it afterwards, and never found he either cheated me or his master. I look upon him to be an honest man.

            . I live with my father, he deals in corn; I know Doyle, as living along with Mr. Life; during the time I have known him he has borne a very good character; I never heard any body that knows him say to the contrary.

            . I am a brewer in Surry; I work for 'squire Thrale; I have known Doyle, I believe, five years; I employ'd him and gave him a character to Mr. Wife a corn chandler in the Borough; he liv'd there between two or three years; he was a very honest good servant the time I knew him there.


                  Philip 
                  Wooley 
               



            . I remember being in company with 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Woolf 
               



            ; I went to see the prisoners after they had been examined before justice Fielding; I heard that Woolf was coming over the way; I went and told 
               
                  Richard 
                  Downs 
               



            ; he went and spoke to him; I went myself and spoke to him after that.
Q. Where was this?
Wooley. At the Barley-mow. I ask'd him if he thought Doyle was innocent; he said, to the best of his knowledge, he thought he was innocent.
Q. Innocent of what did you mean?
Wooley. I spoke as to this particular fact.
Q. Did you ask whether he had received part of the money?
Wooley. I did not.
Q. Who was nearest him, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Downs 
               



             or you?
Wooley. 
               
                  Richard 
                  Downs 
               



             was nearer him than I was.
Q. Who was Woolf talking to, Downs or you?
Wooley. He was talking to me, but Downs must hear it. Then I said, how can you be such a villain to swear against him, if he is innocent? he said, I have done the thing, and I must go on with it.
Q. How long have you known Doyle?
Wooley. Some time; I always took him to be a very honest man.
Q. Was you present before the justice of peace?
Wooley. No, I was not.
Cross examination.
Q. Where do you live?
Wooley. I live in Hungerford-market.

Q. What is your business?
Wooley. I am a peruke-maker.
Q. Did you go with the prisoners to the Barley-mow ?
Wooley. No; I went afterwards there to see them.
Q. Pray who did you find at the Barley-mow ?
Wooley. There was 
               
                  Tom 
                  Doyle 
               



            , 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



            , and 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Woolf 
               



             there.
Q. Were they all together?
Wooley. No, they were not. Woolf was in the fore-room, the others were backwards.
Q. Did you see 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



            ?
Wooley. No, I did not.
Q. Did you see nobody else?
Wooley. There was 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis 
               



            's wife; she fell into fits.
Q. In whose custody were they?
Wooley. I don't know in whose; there were some of the keepers with them, and a great many people.
Q. What did Woolf say Doyle was innocent of?
Wooley. Innocent of this affair of taking the rum. I mentioned this robbery at the beginning of the conversation; I ask'd him if Doyle was innocent of this affair of stealing the rum.
Q. Did you mention stealing rum?
Wooley. I said, whether was he guilty of what he was taken up for?
Q. How many persons heard him say this besides you?
Wooley. I know Downs heard him.


                  Edward 
                  North 
               



            . I keep a public-house in Hungerford-market; I've known Doyle between two and three years; he was always a very honest man, as far as ever I heard; and was so looked upon in the neighbourhood in general.
Q. to Harison. Have you heard what this Downs says concerning Doyle?
Harison. I have. If he means my seeing him bring the bottle out of the vault, he is right. I have known Doyle some time, he has behav'd very well. I was sorry for him. I said to Woolf, at Mr. Crossland's that morning, don't go to charge an innocent man, if he is not concerned; he said, Doyle was the least concerned. If Downs means any private conversation, or persuasion of mine, it is utterly false.
Q. Did Woolf continue always to charge Doyle?
Harison. He did; he said, he had been with him several times, and had had several bottles, but always denied he had any of the money; he said, he never had a shilling; and since that, he has said, Doyle had a share of it. I never had any intimacy with Woolf; I knew him at Mr. Hide's, a servant. I heard Mr. Fielding and Mr. Welch, divers times, order him to charge no innocent person, and to be very careful what he did.
Q. to Woolf. Were Downs and you together at the Barley-mow ?
Woolf. We were, he asked me if Doyle was innocent, I said no he was not. I said he had none of the money, but he had rum, and that he had gone down in the cellar several times.
Q. Do you know Wooley?
Woolf. I don't know Wooley, I never spoke to him in my life to my knowledge.
Q. Do you know of this conversation they mention?
Woolf. I don't know I had such conversation with any body. I had very little conversation, neither did I mention Mr. Harrison's name. I remember there was one Tuffnail there.


                  William 
                  Tuffnail 
               



            . I was at the Barley-mow with the prisoners. I do not remember I saw Wooley there.
Q. If he had been there, should you have seen him?
Tuffnail. I should, there was one asked several questions about the innocency of Doyle, I don't remember that Woolf said any thing, he courted him to get Doyle of, and Woolf said, Doyle was guilty in the small things, but was innocent of the money.
Cross examination.
Q. Was you with Woolf all the time?
Tuffnail. I was. I went in and out with him, and kept with him all the time. So there could be no conversation but what I heard.

             was porter to us two years ago, he used to receive small sums of money, and always behaved faithful and honest, and we gave him a very good character, but what he has been since I know not.
Mr. Baker. I am a distiller, I knew 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Davis

            , and have been about nine weeks.

I know nothing about the person that came about altering a key.
Q. Do you know that some person came about it?
Robertson. I do'nt know that any person did.
Q. What do you know?
Robertson. I know I did the key.
Q. What key?
Robertson. The key they charge my master about.
Q. Look at this key, (the false key.)
Robertson. I can't really say this is the key or not, but to the best of my knowledge, I think it is.
Q. It is what?
Robertson. It was alter'd by me.
Cross examination.
Q. Has that key (look well as it) received any alteration since you altered it?
Robertson. I think it was whole here (putting his finger to a place in the wards filed away to a large opening.) and it was not so bright as it is now.
Q. By whose orders did you open it?
Robertson. I opened it by my master's orders.
Q. Did you know what use the key was for?
Robertson. No, I did not at all. I asked my master if it would do, and when I had opened the wards of it, he said yes.
Q. Whether this is not a picklock key, and not for opening a lock in the common way?
Robertson. I never did many keys before.
Q. Did you ever make a key in your life?
Robertson. I never did make many, that can go through all locks quite.
Q. Did you ever see a key made in this kind but what was made to be a picklock?
Robertson. Upon my word I do not know. I can't say I have seen many made in that kind.
Q. Was there a lock by you to make it by?
Robertson. Not as I saw.

                  Davis 
               



             about three years. I have employ'd him sometime, he has taken a good many hundred pounds of me. I never employed a man that behaved better, he has behaved remarkably honest.
Q. In what way did he work for you?
Robertson. He worked for me in the smith's way, in making grates and such like things. I would have trusted him with any sum of money, but for this transaction I can't say. I believe he is worth a hundred pounds. I don't apprehend he is under any temptation to do this thing through necessity.
Mr. Townsend. I am in the braziery way. I have known 
               
                  David 
                  Davis 
               



             upwards of two years, he has been a very punctual, honest man. Was he discharged from this place, I should he glad to let him have a sum of money, if he wanted it, to carry on work, and to employ him again; as to this case I know nothing of it.

             about two years.
Q. What is his general character?
Horsley. He is an honest man. I have had an opportunity of knowing a good deal of his private character in life, he is frequently at work. I never heard any ill of him, I really look upon him to be a man hardly capable of doing this. So far from scheming any thing base, if he knew of it, I think he would rather sooner divulge it, there is not a more inoffensive person in court.

Q. What is his general character?
Harvey. He is a very industrious man, he bears as good a character as any labouring man can, his thoughts were always upon his business, a man that took as much pains to live as any man in the city of London.

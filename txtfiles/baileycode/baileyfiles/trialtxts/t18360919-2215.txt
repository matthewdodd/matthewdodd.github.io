JULIA JOSEPH
. I am the wife of Myers Joseph, and live at Woolwich On the 30th of August I saw the prisoner at my shop—I saw him take seven weights, and put them into his pocket—I kept him, and called out for assistance—a young man came to me—he knocked me down, and ran away—a young man caught him—these are the weights.





SIMON JACOB
. I was in the workshop when the prisoner was in the shop, and my mistress called for assistance—I came up, and the prisoner knocked my mistress down, and threw part of the weights on the ground—I caught hold of him—he dragged me a little distance, and a neighbour came out, and said I should let him alone—the prisoner bit my finger, and escaped—we gave information, and he was taken on Thursday or Friday—I am sure he is the same.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years more.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

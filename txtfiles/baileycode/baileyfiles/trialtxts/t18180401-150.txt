JOHN PERRY. I am a labourer. I was at work in a field-a lady said two men had been robbing a garden; I turned round, and saw the prisoner and another man under a wall-the prisoner had a bundle. One of them said, "Come on!" I called out Stop thief! he threw the bundle down - I followed, and secured him. I never lost sight of him.

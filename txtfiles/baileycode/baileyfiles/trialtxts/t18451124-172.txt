WILLIAM BENBOW
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



William Evans, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM EVANS
. On the 20th of Nov. I was close to the Elephant and Castle—I got half-way across the road—a man ran past me—I crossed, and turned, and saw the prisoner between two officers—one of them had my handkerchief—I claimed it—it had been in my pocket just before—this is it.





CHARLES WRIGHT
 (police-constable N 304.) I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from Mr. Evans's coat-pocket—he was in the act of handing it to another who was in company with him—I seized the prisoner—another officer came up—I went to try to find the other who had run off, but I could not—I turned hack, and saw the other officer had got the prisoner and handkerchief—there was a crowd of ten or a dozen persons—some carriages were passing—the prosecutor paused for a moment, and then it was done.

Prisoner. I was waiting for my father; I saw the other man take the handkerchief; they took me, and said they knew me to be a convicted thief; they found it on the ground; I was not near it. Witness. The prisoner took it;

I put my hands round him; the other one ran across, and got off; I called for assistance, and gave the prisoner to another officer.

Prisoner. He says false, it was not me took it.
(The prisoner pleaded guilty to the previous conviction.)

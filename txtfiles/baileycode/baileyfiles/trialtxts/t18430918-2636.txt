HENRY BURGE
. I live in St. John's-square, Clerkenwell—on Wednesday, the 1st of September, about ten minutes after eight in the morning, I went to the Serpentine, in Hyde Park, to bathe—I put my clothes down on the bank—after I came out, I missed my trowsers, boots, and jacket—this is my jacket (produced)—I have not seen my boots or trowsers since.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me there? A. No.





FREDERICK FISHER
. On Wednesday evening, about a quarter to nine o'clock, I met the prisoner in New-street, Brompton; he asked me if I wanted to buy a jacket—I said I had not got any money, I would go and ask my mother—I afterwards bought it of him for 4d.—this is it—I know him by sight—I never bought anything of him before—I gave him the money—he did not give me the jacket; one of the other boys gave it me—there were three more boys with him.





SAMUEL GUMMER
 (police-constable B 131.) I apprehended the prisoner on the Thursday night after this—he denied all knowledge of it.

Prisoner's Defence. Going through the park, I met some boys with a jacket—they asked me to go with them; I did—they asked me if I would ask this boy whether he wanted to buy a jacket; I did so, and the boy that had the jacket gave it him—he gave me the money, and I gave it to the boy; I did not know it was stolen.





EDWARD SYMES
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person who was tried and convicted.




GUILTY

Transported Seven Years—Parkhurst.

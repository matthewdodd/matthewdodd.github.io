             and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Knight
               



            , were both Indicted for 


               picking the Pocket of one 
                     
                        Frances 
                        Rogers
                     




                  , Wife
 of 
                     
                        Daniel 
                        Rogers
                     



                  , on the 24th of December
 last, taking out a Silver Thimble, value 12 d. and 25 s. in Mony
            : The Prisoners met Mrs. Rogers in Bishopgate street


, about Noon-Tide and Rothery jostled her, and Knight put her hand in her Pocket, and took the Bag with the Mony, and gave it to a Third Person, who run away with it: The Prisoners denied the Fact; and were very confident in their behaviour, and gave no good Account of themselves; they said they lived in White Chappel, but had no Evidence on their side to prove any thing; so at length Rothery was 

               Accquitted
            , but Knight was found 

               Guilty
            .

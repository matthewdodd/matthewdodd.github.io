            . On the 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Strand


, standing to look at the twelvth-cakes in Mr. Carpenter's shop; I felt something drawn from my pocket, and immediately missed my watch. I turned round, and saw the prisoner shoving something into his breeches; I pursued, and caught him in the street, leading to Waterloo Bridge. I asked him for my watch, he immediately gave it to me, and then said he never had it. I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the watch.

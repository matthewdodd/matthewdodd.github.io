JAMES ALPIN. On the 1st of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner on Snowhill; she accosted me, and told me there was a person at her lodgings who wanted to speak to me. I went to a house in George-alley, Fleet-market


, with her, and agreed to stop there; I went to sleep, and when I awoke, about five o'clock in the morning, I found her gone, my trowsers removed from the table, seven 1l. notes taken out, and the trowsers on the floor. She was stopped at a house in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and five 1l. notes found upon her. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. I had a watch about me, but I did not lose that.
WILLIAM TAYLOR. On the 2d of April I was called to a house in Angel-alley, St. Martin's-le-Grand; I found the prosecutor there, he charged the prisoner with robbing him of seven 1l. notes; I found five 1l. notes upon her, the prosecutor claimed them, and said he was sure she was the woman; she said she had them from a friend in the country, but would not tell me his name. I produce the notes.

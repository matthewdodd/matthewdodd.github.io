            . I am carman to Messrs. Henry and H. Harben, who are cheesemongers

, and live in High-street, Bloomsbury. I delivered some tubs of butter for them on the evening of the 6th of January; I went to the off side of the cart, upon hearing a noise in the cart - I then saw the prisoner with a cask of butter, about four doors off; he threw it into the road, and ran away - I followed crying Stop thief! and did not lose sight of him till he was taken. I am quite sure of his person.

I saw the prisoner with the tub of butter; Tibbles cried Thief! and he threw it down - we followed him to the top of the street - I then returned, and took up the butter.

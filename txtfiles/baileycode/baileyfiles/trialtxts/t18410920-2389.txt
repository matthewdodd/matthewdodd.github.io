THOMAS MARTIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



Thomas Keep, from his person.






THOMAS KEEP
. I am a tailor, and live in Northumberland-street, Strand. On the 10th of September I was at the corner of West-street, about eleven o'clock, looking in at a shop-window—I felt a tug at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I accused him of stealing it, and made a snatch at it—he threw it the ground—I picked it up, turned round, and the prisoner was then standing in the road—I said, "If you will wait here a minute I will give you in charge of the police"—he attempted to strike me, but I stooped—

he ran away—I pursued him—I lost sight of him merely in turning the corner—I am quite certain he is the person—another man took him—this handkerchief now produced is mine.





MARTIN WILLIAMS
. I am a policeman. I was in Long-acre, and heard an alarm given—I went to the corner of the street, and found the prisoner in the prosecutor's custody, who accused him of stealing his handkerchief, which I have produced.

Prisoner's Defence. I am a cripple with both my hands, and it is impossible I could pick the gentleman's pocket.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

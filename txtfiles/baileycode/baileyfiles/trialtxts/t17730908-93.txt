            . On the 16th of August I was asleep in Tottenham-court-road


, between St. Giles's Church and Hog-lane; when I awaked I missed my buckles; I saw two girls; I took them up on suspicion to the Round-house; I fell asleep at the Round-house about eleven at night. The buckles were not found upon either of those girls. The next morning the prisoner came into the Round-house to see them; one of the girls that was taken up thought the prisoner was the girl that had the buckles; they searched her and found the buckles upon her; she was not present then but above stairs.
The Round-house keeper confirmed this evidence.

            , Esq. On the 31st of January, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking up Tottenham-court-road


, I felt some one touch me, and on turning round, saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand. I pursued him calling Stop thief! he ran down a street, and a gentleman's servant rode across, which stopped him. His hat came off, and the handkerchief blew out. I collared him, and he begged forgiveness.

            . I was in Tottenham-court-road. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards the square; a man rode his horse to the pavement, which stopped him; his hat fell off, and the handkerchief came out; he ran about three paces, and I seized him.

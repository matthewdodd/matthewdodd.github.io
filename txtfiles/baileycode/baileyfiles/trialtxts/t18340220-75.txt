             - I have a wife and four children, all living in the house - on the 19th of February, I went to bed about eleven o'clock - there are two rooms in the house; I have the ground floor-room, and sleep there with my wife and children, and McNeill has the upper room - my childeren were all in bed with me and my wife - my wife came to bed after me - the street-door opens into my room - there is no passage - I awoke about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and heard a noise like a man coming down stairs from McNeill's room - I called out, "Is that Mrs. McNeill?" - I received no answer; but the prisoner opened the street-door, and ran out to make his escape - I bolted out, naked as I was, and ran after him, and the policeman caught him - I kept him in sight all the way - he ran about three or four hundred yards - the prisoner is the man - the policeman found a silk handkerchief and some flannel on him in my presence - when he opened the street-door, I could see him by the moon-light - it was not daylight, but I could see him, by the light of the moon, standing in my room.

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor - our house is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green - on the 19th of February, I went to bed last, and I shut the street-door, at eleven o'clock, and fastened it by a springlock - I locked it - I was awake in the morning, and my husband called out, "Thief," - I saw the man run out; and found the door had been broken in - the lock was broken in - it was pushed back - I am sure I fastened it the night before - it was half-past five o'clock in the morning when I awoke.

I lodge in the upper part of Donovan's house - I went to bed after him, on the night of the 19th of February - I was in my own room when they went to bed - I was awoke in the morning by the prosecutor jumping out of bed - I think it was between four and five o'clock - it was dark, but not so dark but I could see a person - it was not daylight, till near seven o'clock in the morning - the day was breaking, getting gradually lighter and lighter - I cannot swear to the time - the day must have been breaking, or we could not see anything - it could not be moon-light at that time - I saw no moon, nor do I believe it was moon-light - I saw nothing, but heard my landlord jump out of bed in a scuffle, and heard the children screaming - the scuffle and noise was below stairs - I had not heard any noise in my room - I never awoke - I saw nobody in the house - Mrs. Danovan called out - I went down, and saw the prisoner standing there with the policeman, and Mrs. Donovan had the flannel in her hand - I recognised it to be part of the work I had to do; and I said, "Where is the other part?" - the two flannel petticoats were in a bundle by my bed-side the night before - I am the wife of

             - I have not seen him - for two years - I do not know whether he is living - he left me with four children - I missed two neck handkerchiefs and a cap; I found the other part of the flannel in the privy in the handkerchief, and took them to the station-house - a silk handkerchief was shown to me by the policeman, that hung over a bonnet the night before in my room.

            . I am a policeman - I was on duty on the 20th of February, and apprehended the prisoner about half-past five in the morning, it was just breaking daylight - there was daylight enough to distinguish persons' countences - the moon was not shining - Donovan was running after him - I searched him, and found on him a flannel and this silk handkerchief - I took the flannel from his trowsers, and the handkerchief out of his trowsers pocket, and he had a knife - I took him to the station-house, and found fourpence in his pocket, and a needlecase, which the prosecutrix owned - when I took the prisoner, I asked where he had been, and he told me into the privy, which is in front of the house.

            . This pocket is mine - I found it that night outside the street door on the railing - I had put it under my head when I went to bed, under the bolster; and it had sixpence in copper in it, and a duplicate - when I found it in the morning, there was nothing in it - I found none of the copper on the ground - none of the pence had any mark on them.

             re-examined. This flannel is what I missed - it is a petticoat not finished - I had it to work on from Oxford-street - this handkerchief covered a bonnet which hung on a nail; it was there when I went to bed, and I missed it in the morning.

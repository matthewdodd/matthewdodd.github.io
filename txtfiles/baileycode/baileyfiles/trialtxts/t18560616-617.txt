WALTER BOLITHO
. I was a seaman on board the Stebonheath. I did not go out in her, I joined her at Melbourne—she was an English ship, belonging to the port of London—I went on board on the 29th Jan., in the present year—the prisoner also shipped as a seaman on board the vessel—he joined at Melbourne, about a fortnight after I had joined—I never saw him before he joined the ship; he was on board two or three days before we sailed—we sailed on 17th Feb.—the crew consisted of about thirty-two altogether—I cannot say the number of passengers exactly, there were upwards of twenty; twenty or twenty-five, I think—there were some women—we had a large quantity of gold on board, it was said to be two tons and a half—on the morning of the 18th I was at the wheel from 8 to 10 o'clock—while I was there the prisoner came on the poop to do some work—he asked me if I would like to have charge of this here, meaning the poop, putting his foot on the deck—I did not make him any answer—nothing more passed at that time—on the evening of the same day I was on the look-out in the forecastle heads, from 8 to 10 o'clock—the prisoner came there—he asked me if I had been to Callao, or on the coast of Peru—I said, "No," I never

was round that part—he said, "I have been a long time knocking about there; I have been under the Peruvian government at the time they were at war with the Chilians; I thought to make a d—fine thing of it, for when I joined I agreed to have forty-eight hours' plunder after we took the town; we went up at 12 o'clock at night, and began to fire on the town; we fired too high, and they took the steamboat from us; we were all took ashore, and allowed 6d. a day for eleven weeks, thinking that we should join their service; when they found we would not join, they stopped our money, and twenty of us went down the river and joined the Peruvian service again; we took a canoe; there was a man and two women in it; we made them get out, and proceeded down the river, and joined the Peruvians again in another steamboat"—he said, "We were lying at anchor at 12 o'clock at night, and the soldiers on board, being mostly Chilians, took the steamboat from us; I was asleep on the quarter deck when one of the English sailors came to me, and awoke me, and told me that she was in the hands of the soldiers; I then got up to try to get for'ard, but the sentry aft stopped me; I then, being able to talk Spanish, got over the sentry aft; I then got for'ard, and the sentry for'ard stopped me from going down; I then got over the sentry, and got below; when I got down below I found them all asleep; I awoke them, wanting for them to try to take the ship back again; they asked me how I was going to manage it; I said, "You have plenty of ammunition, and I will go up and shoot the sentry aft, and when you hear the report of the pistol, shoot the sentry for'ard;' when I got aft I found them plundering the cabin; there was a writing desk which I knew to be the captain's; I took the butt end of a musket and broke it open; there were fourteen ounces dropped out, and I picked up seven out of it; I then fired, and shot the sentry, and them for'ard, hearing the report of the pistol, fired at the sentry for'ard, but missed him, and did not try it again; next morning we was took ashore, and shoved in chokey"—that is a nautical term for "in prison"—"we thought we should have been shot, but we were only made well fast; I and twenty more broke out of prison, then took a schooner lying above the fort, and battened all hands below, and slipped the cable, and passed the fort very nicely until we came to the guard ship; they hailed us, I answered them in Spanish; we were ordered down to the mouth of the river, and next morning we had a nice offing; we fell in then with two small craft, coming back from selling their cargo; we hoarded them, and took their money, and sank the vessels; we then went on the coast of California, thinking to meet some of the money vessels coming up the coast; we were there three weeks before we fell in with one, we boarded her, and found she had 7,000 ounces of gold on board; we took the gold, and served her the same fete as the two vessels before; we then came to Callao; after that we lost the schooner on the reefs, but saved the money; I and two or three more then shipped for England, and arrived in London, and then came out here, "meaning Port Philip—he then asked me how I would like to be at that game—I said it would do very well, if I could always get clear—he then said, "It will be a go if we are pressed, or taken by the Russians; it will, be a d—fine prize, two tons or two tons and a half of gold; how would you like to go shares with it yourself?"—I said, "I should like if very well, but that will never come to pass"—he said, "It could be done very easy; if you will only stick to me, I will have it before forty-eight hours, for I have come on board on purpose for it; what do you say? it must be done, and shall be done; that is the word, "stamping his foot upon the deck—I said to him I did not think it

could be done—he said, "Who is there here that you care about; there is nothing here but a lot of old b—s, that ought to have been out of this world long ago"—I then asked him bow he was going to manage it—he said, "There is not a man in the forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog; give them a dose, and they will not know of it, and we will put them all right; the look-out, we will pass him overboard, and then we will cut the back rope, go aft, and ask the second mate, the officer of the watch, to come for'ard, and serve him the same as the look-out, and they are settled with, out any more noise"—he then asked me if I was frightened to take a life—before that he said, "There is no one but the boatswain and the carpenter then to fear about; a small bit of steel will settle them"—he then said, "Are you frightened to take a life?"—I said, "I never have done it yet"—he said, "I won't ask you to do that, I will do all that myself; do you think another one would do better, so as to have one on each side of the deck?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Who can you pick on?"—I picked on a man of the name of Whittington, it being his next look-out to relieve me—I did not tell him that Whittington was the next look-out, but I picked upon Whittington because it was his next look-out—before this passed about Whittington, he said, "After the captain and mate is out of the way, we will then go aft, and haul up the ladder, and lay it across the; hatch, so as no one can come up from below; I know who sleeps in every berth, and where the arm chest is, and I will load everything in the arm chest, and then tell the passengers that the ship is in the hands of the crew, and they will think all hands are in it; then I will go into the rooms, and pick them off as I want them"—he said be would shoot the captain and mate, and he should have twelve shots left after he had shot them—I asked him if he would kill the women too—he said, "Only the old women, we will keep the young ones until we get on the coast of Peru, and when we get the gold in the boat, we will scuttle the ship, and let the women go down with her; we can then bury the gold in the sand, and we can either go to the Salt Lake, or take the steamboat to Panama, and then we are all right; it is only a bold stroke, and it is ours as easy as anything"—he then began with Whittington—four bells struck, and Whittington came—during this long talk, I drank twice with the prisoner, it was brandy—the prisoner had it, he get it from a keg standing on the forecastle head, where we were standing—he took it out of that—when Whittington came up, the prisoner said to him, "We shall be a fine prize for the Russians to fall in with, Tom"—that was the first thing he said to him—he gave Whittington a pannikin of brandy, and said, "How would you like to have your share in it?"—Whittington drank the brandy, and it made him sick, and he said, "D—it, that is brandy sure enough"—he said, "Yes, that is the real stuff"—Whittington said if we were taken by the Russians be would volunteer until we fell in with a British man-of-war, or else we should get cooked—the prisoner then said to Whittington, "What do you say, will you join? there is a way of getting of it, if you will only stick to me, I will sign the contract with my heart's blood; what do you say to that, Tom? will you join? for there was never a better ship came out of Melbourne or Hobson's Bay, that will be easier took, for when the captain and mate is out of the way, I will have charge of the ship in ten minutes"—he said, "There is not a man in the forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog, is there?"—Tom said, "No"—he said, "With some stuff, I can give them a dose, and she won't know of it; they won't get over it just directly"—Whittington asked me what I thought of it—I said I did not think it could be managed

—the prisoner asked Whittington how many he wanted to join—he said, "Not lees than half a dozen"—the prisoner laid, "Who can you depend upon?"—Whittington said, "Not one"—he said, "It has got to be done, and it must be done, for I have come on board on purpose for that, and nothing else, and the sooner it is done the better, for the ship shall never take me round the Horn, nor neither to London'—he said, "I shall load my revolvers to-morrow, and I shall not unload them until they hare done execution"—he said to Tom, "You load yours, but clean it first; you need not be frightened at a pistol; you have been in the Ballarat riots"—Whittington said he was no more frightened of a pistol than he was—the prisoner said he knew that, and that was the reason he put it to him—he said we would get the gold in the boat, and bury it in the sand—he told the same to Whittington as what he had told to me, and after the gold was buried in the sand he would scuttle the ship—eight bells then struck, and we separated—on the following morning (Tuesday, 19th) Whittington and I were on watch together on deck from 4 o'clock to 8, and we had some talk together about this; the prisoner was not there—he was in the same watch till we went below—I had no talk with the prisoner till we went below—that was from 8 o'clock to 12—we were then off watch—he was then kneeling over his hunk, after breakfast; he beckoned to me, and I went there—he took out two revolvers, and said. "What do you think of them I"—there were six barrels to each revolver—there were also two single barrelled pistols, and two daggers, and two or three small bottles—when he asked me what I thought of them, I said they were stunners—I said "I see you are well prepared for it"—he said, "By G—, they have never deceived me yet, and they are not going to do it either; I am a dead shot with either of these pistols"—he showed me how the pistols worked—he said, "I can discharge every one of these barrels as quick as I can Work my finger"—I then saw him feed the pistols—he loaded them with balls—in some barrels he put two halls, and in some one—he did not load them all—I only saw him load the two six-barrelled revolvers—I did not see him load the single pistols; I do not know whether they were loaded—lie then put them into his bag, and put it into his bunk, where he slept—it does not shut down or shut up in any way; it stands about five feet off the deck—I asked him what was in them bottles—he said, "Ton can judge," and carefully put them back again into the bag—I saw that the bottles were full of something; it was a liquid—in the course of that day one of the crew went to the boatswain for some spun yarn—he gave it him, and said he must be very careful of it, for they must soon begin to make some—the prisoner laid to me, "Do you hear that? if he lives to see any span yarn made, I am deceived"—on the following day (Wednesday, 20th) the prisoner came to me, as I was coming from the wheel, and said he was frightened that Whittington would have nothing to do with it, "but b—him, we will get his revolver, and then we don't care whether he joins or not; we will talk it over in the next watch; we can settle Whittington; don't you think you and I can manage it?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I will go and sound Jonathan," meaning a seaman of the name of Hugh Kent, who went by the name of Jonathan—he then went over to Kent, who was on the other side of the deck, and had some conversation with him, which I did not hear—while he was with Kent, Whittington went over to him; he came back, and said that they had some brandy there, and the prisoner had asked him to have some; after that the prisoner came over, and said, "It is all right, I find he is staunch as a piece of iron, and we don't care whether Whittington jobs or not now;

what do you say now for to-morrow night? we are far enough to the south'ard; she is just under the canvas I want; that will do all the way to the coast of Peru; there could not be a better time; they are all sick in the cabin; I hope you are not funking upon it; we will have it tomorrow night"—I said, no, I was not funking on it—he said, "That is right, for I have got everything ready, everything prepared"—he said, "You are not frightened of a pistol? I have stood before four armed men, and told them to stand, and made them deliver up everything they had got, and they were glad to get away with their lives"—I asked him where about was that, and he said it was on the Avoca diggings—I asked him how long he had been out here—he said, "Four years, but I have been in England since"—after this I asked him what he had in the bottles—he said it was laudanum, and mentioned some other stuff which I forget the name of—he said that he would put that in the brandy, and that would make all hands quiet enough—with this brandy he was going to have a birthday, and the laudanum and the other stuff he was going to put in this, and hocus the crew for'ard—he said, "There is Jack, Long Jem, Phillips, and Harry Bluff; we will give them an extra dose, so as to make sure of them"—on the following evening; Thursday, the 21st, I was on the look-out, on the forecastle end, from 6 to 8 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me, and said, "Well, my chief officer, what do think of it now T—I said, "As much as ever I did"—he said, "What do you say for to-morrow night? there can't be a better time, and we are far enough to the south'ard"—I told him that he had better leave it alone altogether, for I should have nothing at all to do with it—he then said, "I would as soon go down now and shoot myself as not; it is Whittington that has been persuading you off it"—I said, "No, I wanted no persuasion"—he said, "I will be revenged on him; if it had not been for you and Tom, she would have been in my hands long before this; all that I am sorry fat is that ever I spoke to a soul on board"—he then said, "If I can depend on you and Whittington, she shall be in my hands before Saturday morning, at 4 o'clock, or else I will be a corpse in that cabin; I have been stopping on shore six weeks, waiting for the Hong Kong escort, but, as there was no gold shipped for China, I took this, being the first chance"—Whittington was not present at this conversation—when I came off the lookout at 8 o'clock, I told Whittington to look out for himself, and told him what had passed between me and the prisoner—on the Friday morning I saw the captain and mate, and made a disclosure of this; Whittington went first, and reported it to the mate, and then we were both called in together to the captain—it was on the Thursday evening that I had the last talk with the prisoner; I came off the look-out at 8 o'clock, and saw Whittington that same night; I think it was from 12 to 4 o'clock—it was about 9 o'clock on Friday morning that I saw the captain.

Cross-examined by
MR. GIFFARD. Q. You joined, I think you told us, about a fortnight before the prisoner? A. I cannot say exactly about that, the ship was not loading the gold at that time, it was loaded two or three days before she sailed—it was the prisoner that told me there was two tons and a half on board; that was on the Monday after we sailed—I did not know before that how much gold there was on board—I had seen the gold coming on board about two or three days before she sailed, I cannot say to a day; I lent a hand to take it on board—I think it all came on board the same day, I am not sure—the prisoner and I were strangers; we had never seen each other before we joined this ship—I had been a sailor before—I had sailed in ships with gold in them before—I came home in a ship with

gold once before, I do not know what else was in it—it was on the Monday after we sailed that the prisoner first spoke to me—we left Port Philip on the Sunday—I had conversed with him before, but Monday was the first time he spoke about this matter—all he said that morning was, "How would you like to be master here? "putting his foot on the poop; it was on the evening of the same day that this long conversation took place—I have been examined before the Magistrate on this charge—he told me of his having fallen in with a schooner having 7,000 ounces on board, and that they scuttled the ship—he said, "The dead tell no tales"—he did not say they had murdered the passengers and crew, I understood that they were sunk with the vessel and drowned—I did not tell him anything about what I had done—I did not say that I had run away with a British ship that had 700l. worth of jewellery on board, I swear that; nothing of the sort, I did not tell him anything—I had no revolver, I swear that, nor any gunpowder, nothing of the kind—my bunk was not searched.

Q. On this Monday night, when he told you what the plan was, how many persons did you understand were to be murdered in the course of it t A. I did not know he was going to kill all hands forward, and he was going to shoot them aft—those forward were to be focussed, he was going to give them a dose that would make them quiet enough, those aft were to be killed, and those forward first drugged with laudanum, and then thrown overboard—I cannot say what the boatswain's name is, most likely he is here, I have not seen him to-day—I do not know the man's name that went for the spun yarn; he is not there—it was on the Thursday that the prisoner addressed me as his chief officer—it had not been arranged at all that I was to be chief officer, nothing of the sort had been said before then—I had said that it would require a "good scholar to navigate the ship—I think I said that on the Monday night when he was talking to Whittington—Whittington said, "I could do that, but we shall never be strong enough" Whittington told him he must see his way clearly before he went in—I did not say that we wanted more help—I swear that—I did not mention to any person what the prisoner had said to me, between the Monday night and the Friday morning—I was present on the Wednesday night when the conversation took place between Whittington and the prisoner—it was then that the observation was made about Jonathan—I was called away to go to the wheel, I did not hear all that passed—Whittington said it would be better to leave it alone, that he would have nothing to do with it; I did not stop after that—I cannot say what the answer was—there was a good deal passed that I cannot recollect—I saw Whittington's revolver; it was kept in his chest before it was taken aft—there were a good many on board that had revolvers, either a single one or else a revolver, a good many diggers coming down from the diggings—I told the prisoner on the Thursday even-ing that he had better not do it—I did not tell him so till then—I was very much shocked when he proposed this to me—I did not tell him so—I did not say there was not enough of us to do it, not at any time; I am sure of that—when I went and made a communication to the captain, the prisoner was at the wheel—the ship was then under sail—the bag which the prisoner had was in his bunk, it was tied, the place was not locked, there was nothing to prevent any one going to it—the prisoner had been at the wheel about an hour when I went to the captain, or when Whittington went, when we were both called in at 9 o'clock, he went there at 8—I never told Whittington in the prisoner's presence that I had taken 700J, worth of jewellery out of a British ship—that I swear, nothing of the sort—I and Whittington had

not known each other before we joined the ship—the prisoner showed me how his revolver worked; I have had one in my hand before, but never used one, or had one—I have been at the diggings at Mount Blackwood; that is in Victoria district—I was there nine months this last time—I had not been there before, I bad been at Bendigo—I was there about nine weeks—those were the only two diggings I had been to—I was working there in partnership; there was a company of nine of us at Mount Black wood—at Bendigo I had one partner, a sailor man, named John Richardson—that was four years ago—I went by the name of Bolitho there, and also at Blackwood—I can show you my miner's license to prove it, I have not got it with me—my father was a Cornish man—I know what the eye blight is, I have seen a good many with it; it is generally more on the roads than it is on the diggings; I mean in walking on the road, from so much dust flying—dysentery is very common there—the miners do not take laudanum and water for it; I never saw it taken, or applied to the eye, and never heard of it; I generally saw eye blight cured with lump sugar—I do not know what they use for dysentery, I have seen some with dysentery—I never saw any laudanum used for it—I do not know that the miners many laudanum with them for the purpose both of the eye blight and dysentery; there are plenty of doctors' shops on the diggings—I do not know what they get for it—that I swear—I have never heard of it as opium, I have heard tell of laudanum, but do not know at all what it is used for—I never heard tell of its being used on the diggings for dysentery, or eye blight, or to put in the water to drink.

MR. BODKIN. Q. You have been asked whether you were not very much shocked at the proposal that was made to you, and you say, "Yes"! A. Yes—I did not say so—Whittington wanted to go aft, but I said, "You had better hold on till you find out what stuff he has got in them bottles"—I never intended to join in this, on my oath.





THOMAS WHITTINGTON
. I was a seaman on board the Stebonheath I joined at Melbourne, the day before Bolitho—I had not known Bolitho before joining the ship—we sailed on Sunday, the 17th—on the following day I relieved Bolitho at the look-out, at 10 o'clock at night—he remained on the forecastle after I relieved him; the prisoner was there, and he remarked that it would be a fine prize for the Russians to fall in with—I said, laughing, "Yes," and that I would volunteer till we fell in with a British man-of-war, or else we should get cooked—the prisoner said, "Here is a nice pile here, how would you like your share of it?" at the same time he held a pannikin, and told me to take a robber—I drank, and it made me quite sick, and almost took my breath away—I said, "D—it, that is brandy, sure enough"—he said, "Yes, that is the real stuff;" he then asked me again how I should like a share of it, and told me there was two tons on board—he did not say particularly of what, but he was speaking of money or gold, and there was a way of getting it—he said, "There are three of us, and if you two will stick to me, I will sign the contract with my heart's blood"—I then asked Bolitho what he thought of it—he said he did not think it could be done—"No," says I, "I must see clearly before me before I go in"—I then told Lewis that we were not strong enough—he asked me how many we wanted—I said, "Not less than half a dozen"—"Well," said Lewis, "it has got to be done; I am prepared, and came on board for nothing else," and he swore that he would never go round Cape Horn or to London in her—he said, "I could do it alone, but it is too much for one; by G—we will have it without a soul for'ard knowing about it; I

will be master of the cabin in fire minutes"—he then, told me to drink again, and rise my spirits—I told him I must hare some water with it if I did, and be asked Bolitho to fetch some water; some water was brought, and he mixed it, and I drank—after I had drunk, Lewis asked me what I said about it—I told him that I would like it if he would show me clearly how we could go about it—"Well," says he, "there was never a better ship ever come out of Hobson's Bay, and there is not a man in that forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog, is there?"—I said, "No"—"Well," says he, "with this brandy, and some stuff I will put in it, I will give them a dose, they will sleep, and not recover just directly; you have got a revolver, and I have plenty of arms; I will give Watty (meaning Bolitho) one revolver, and you stand in one gangway and him in the other, and if any one stirs shoot them"—I then asked him where would the look-out be—he said, "Oh, he is soon settled, and then we can tell the second mate that the back rope or something is gone for'ard, he will come for'ard, looking over, and we will pitch him off, and all them is settled without the least noise; I will then go aft, I know who sleeps below, where the arm chest is, and the captain and mate I will settle them quietly, it is time they were in hell long ago; I will then haul up the ladder from below, so as they cannot come up, and tell the passengers the ship is in the hands of the crew, if they come out I will shoot them, for I am a dead shot"—he laid he would then have command of all—"As for the women," he said, "we will save them till we scuttle the ship; you can run her down to the coast of Peru, and then get into the boat, get on shore, and bury it for a bit in the send"—Watty made a remark then, that it would want a good scholar—I said, "That I can do, I can run her down there"—Lewis then-asked me if I would join—I told him I would let him know on the next watch—he said that I had been in the Ballarat riots, and I did not ought to be afraid of a pistol—I told him that I was no more afraid of a pistol than he was—he said he knew it, and that was the reason he put it to me—he then asked me if I knew who had pistols in the forecastle—I told him I only knew of two or three—he said, "We must bring it up, and get them all"—he then told me to go and lie in my bunk and consider of it, for it would have to come off to-morrow night in the middle watch—I had a revolver which I kept in my chest—the prisoner told me he should load his fire arms, and told me to load mine, but clean it first—I then went to my bunk—next day, Tuesday, I had the forenoon watch in the morning, and the dog watch in the evening—I saw Bolitho while I was on the forenoon watch, and had some conversation with him—I saw the prisoner again on the dog watch, from 6 to 8 o'clock—after having the conversation with Bolitho, I turned in; I went below and saw the prisoner, he was kneeling on the outside bunk, and leaning ever his bunk, the inside one—Bolitho was there, in his own bunk—after that I had a watch from 6 o'clock till 8—the prisoner came to me then and said, "Well, chummy, have you made up your mind yet?"—I said, "Lewis, you had better leave this alone, three of us will never do it"—he said, "I will try another, will that do?"—I said, "No," six was little enough—he then told me that I wanted more pluck, and asked me what sort of pluck I had in the Ballarat—I told him I had as much as was needed there—he said, "I have got courage enough for a dozen, if I could shove it into you; I have bad shots flying about my head like music"—I said, "Weil, you will never manage this, and I think I will give it up"—he told me to think of it again—he told me he would try Jonathan, meaning Hugh Kent—I said, "No, don't, or you might sell yourself"—he than left me—I was on duty

again next night (Wednesday) from 8 to 12 o'clock—the prisoner came to me in the latter part of the watch, and said, "I spoke to Jonathan, and he is firm"—I said, "You have?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then it will go aft, don't you see how he is always praising the ship up?"—he said, "Oh, that is nothing"—Bolitho came up to us then, and Lewis told us again the same as he had been telling to me; but said he did not tell Kent that we were in it, but that he was going to do it, only tried him whether he would do such a thing; and he said, "I am sure he will join"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with it," but I told him it was safe, and it should go no further—that was all that took place then that I recollect—I then turned in—this was on Wednesday night—on the Friday morning I went to the mate, a little after 8 o'clock, and told him what had happened—the prisoner was then at the wheel—the mate was in his state room—before I went to the mate, I had seen and spoken to Bolitho, a very few minutes before—I was told by the mate to come into the cabin and report it to the captain—I and Bolitho went in together, and the prisoner was taken into custody.

Cross-examined. Q. You have been at the diggings, I believe? A. I have; several, Friar's Creek, Avoca, Ballarat, Pyrenees, Daisy Hill, and the Amphitheatre; no other that I am aware of—I went out in 1853—I was two years altogether at these different diggings—I was at Ballarat at the time of the riots—the prisoner heard me speak of that in the forecastle—there was no place called the Baker's Arms burnt down in the riots, nor set fire to—I did not tell the prisoner that I set fire to the Baker's Arms—(The witness was cautioned by the
COURT
that he was not compelled to answer questions which might tend to criminate himself)—I have been talking about the note in the forecastle—there was a house burnt down—I had nothing to do with the burning of that house, I swear that—I never told the prisoner that I had, nor anything of the sort—I was present when it was burnt; I saw it, I was looking on—at one of the conversations Bolitho said it would want a good scholar, to navigate the ship, I understood—I said I could run her down there—we had a dispute about more help; Bolitho said the help was not strong enough—he did not say, "We want more help;" he said there was not help enough—Walter, and me, and Lewis were disputing about more help—Walter held with me that there was not enough, Lewis said there was plenty—this was on the Tuesday, from 8 till 12 o'clock—it was on the Tuesday, in the dog watch, that Lewis said he would try Jonathan, and I said, "Don't do that, or else you will sell yourself;" or something of that sort—I told him that because I was frightened it should go further before it went aft—T did not know anything about whether Kent would join; I was afraid it would go further among the crew, before it went aft—by "going aft "I mean going to the captain—I have heard Kent praising the ship in the forecastle—I do not know that he was always doing it, I have heard him very often—it was true that he was in the habit of praising the ship.

Q. Therefore you thought it was unlikely that he would join? A. I did not think anything about it, I did not know, I could not say—I never knew him before, he was quite a stranger to me—I did not know what the man was—when he afterwards told me that he had spoken to Kent, I said, "Then I will have nothing to do with if—I got my revolver in Ballarat, not at the time of the riots, long before—people want them there for their own protection—the miners there suffer from dysentery at times, and eye blight; I have had bad eyes myself—I used sulphate of zinc to cure them

—I have not had dysentery—I do not know what the miners use for dysentery—I was never in company with any that had it—I hive heard of them having it, but I never knew what they used—they very often went to town for advice—I do not know that at the remote diggings they take things with them for curing their complaints, I always got what I wanted there—I have not known laudanum taken in water for dysentery, nor for eye blight; I never heard of it; I am quite sure of that—I signed articles on 29th Jan.—I believe I went on board on 1st Feb., I am not certain—I never saw Bolitho before he came on board the ship; that was the first time I ever saw him in my life that I know of; he came on board the day after me—the prisoner joined more than a few hours before the ship sailed, I do not recollect the day he came on board, I did not take particular notice—I will not swear it was more than a day before we sailed—I and Bolitho were not more together than any of my other shipmates that I know of—we saw each other two, or three, or four times after the Monday night; he and I alone together—I did just see the revolvers that were taken from the prisoner's bunk, one day on the cabin table, but not to see what they were perticularly—I know Colt's revolvers—you cannot draw the charge of them very well—I never tried—I always fired them off when I wanted to discharge one—you can draw it if you like, there are plenty of ways of drawing the charge—I believe I could draw a charge out of Colt's revolvers, though I have never tried it.

MR. BODKIN. Q. You said that you were afraid this matter would get farther before it got aft; what did you mean by that? A. I was afraid it would get among the crew; I wanted the captain to know it before it went any further, as I did not know the crew; they were all strangers to me—I never had the least intention to join in this at all.

MR. GIFFARD. Q. In any of these conversations we have heard of, have you heard Bolitho say anything about a vessel that had 700l. worth of jewellery in it? A. No—I never beard such a thing, he never said anything to me at any time about it—I never heard him mention anything about a vessel that had 700l. worth of gold or jewellery on board, nor a large amount—I never heard anything more than Bolitho said that Lewis had told him that he (Lewis) had took a ship with 7,000 ounces of gold, and two market boats as well—he never told me anything about his being in a vessel in which there was a large quantity of gold or jewellery, not at any time.





HUGH KENT
. I was a seaman on board the Stebonheath. I joined her at Melbourne about three days before she sailed—when I came on board they called me a Yankee and Jonathan—I am not a native of the United States—on the Wednesday after the ship sailed, I was walking on the starboard side of the deck with three others, when Lewis came and touched me on the shoulder, and asked me would I have a glass of brandy—I said, "Yes," being cold—I went with him down to leeward, and sat on the top of a water cask—he handed me a pannikin about three parts full of brandy—a pannikin is a tin thing that we take our coffee out of, it holds a pint—I took the pannikin out of his hand, and drank part of it, and I returned him the pannikin, and he drank part of it—he then said, "It is a fine chance here now"—I asked him which way—he said, "There is plenty of gold down below, and we shall fasten the passengers up, and we shall put one man on the captain's door, and one on the mate's door," and he asked me would I consent to it—I asked how many would it require—he said he could do it with four, and he only wanted me—I told him that would not

be enough, I wanted more—he did not mention who the others were, he said he was sure of four more out of the forecastle—with that, Little Tom came up, as we called him, that is Whittington, and the discourse dropped for that time—on the following evening (Thursday) he came to me again, and asked me would I come and have a glass of grog with him, and we went on the starboard side, a little at the far end of the galley—he handed me a pannikin with about three glasses of grog in it—I drank about a glass, he told me to drink more, which I did not—he had told me in the first conversation that he would heave Mr. Harris, the second mate, overboard—nothing passed on the Thursday evening—he was going to tell me who we going to be the persons to take her, but a few chaps happened to be larking, and I jumped off the water cask and ran for'ard, and went in the forecastle, and stopped there—when Whittington came up on the Wednesday night the conversation did not go on, it stopped; he handed the pannikin to Tom to drink out of it, and Tom drank.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you sent for on the Friday morning into the captain's cabin? A. Yes, after the prisoner was taken—up to that time I had not made any communication to anybody—I had not been at the diggings.





THOMAS WHITTINGTON

re-examined. At the time the prisoner proposed pitching the look-out and the second mate overboard, there would be the men of the second watch on deck—there would be eleven or twelve of us in the watch, but they might be asleep, or in the forecastle smoking a pipe; it would be their duty to be on deck—there would be ten left, after pitching over the look-out and the mate; of those ten there would be myself, Lewis, Kent, and Bolitho—there would then be six left—the crew consisted of about thirty-three—we were divided into two watches; there was a great many that did not keep watch—it was usual to have eleven or twelve on deck at night—I have known most of us to be asleep when it was a fine night; we are always called by the look-out if ire are wanted.





JAMES CONNELL
. I was chief mate of the Stebonheath. On Friday, 22nd Feb., I was in my cabin between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning—Whittington came to me, and made a communication, and shortly afterwards I communicated with the captain in his cabin—Bolitho and Whittington afterwards came into the captain's cabin, and made a statement in his presence—after that I went on deck—the prisoner was at the wheel—I went behind him, and took hold of him by the captain's orders—he said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "Oh, never mind, you will know by-and-bye"—I then handcuffed him—the carpenter of the ship was with me.

Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell me when tie prisoner came on board? A. No, I cannot—the articles are here (produced)—fourteen or fifteen is the proper number of men to be on deck at one watch—they are not always on deck, they are in general; it is their duty to be on deck.





JOHN SEBGEANT
. I was master of the Stebonheath. She was a ship of 1,014 tons burden—she had a crew of thirty-five or thirty-six men, and twenty-two passengers, there were about eight men, I think, and the same number of females, and the others were children—I scarcely know in what station of life the passengers generally were; some were merchants—there were none who had come from the diggings—we had a large quantity of gold on board, 61,000 ounces—the value of that would be 240,000l. or 250,000l.—these are the ship's articles—Lewis signed articles on 14th Feb.—he would not come on board the same day—I think he came on board a day or two before we sailed—I did not know him before, nor Whittington,

Kent, or Bolitho; they were all strangers—on Friday, 22nd Feb., a communication was made to me by the chief mate, in consequence of which I sent for Bolitho and Whittington—they made a statement to me, which was entered in the official log—I gave the mate directions to seize the prisoner; he was then at the wheel—he was kept in confinement until we arrived in England—I had his bonk searched previous to his being secured—I was not present—a bag was brought to me—I sent the second mate, Harris, with Whittington and Bolitho—the bag contained these things (produced by inspector White)—here are two six-barrelled Colt revolvers, some of them double shotted—the second bullets hare been rammed home with a piece of wood which was taken from the prisoner's pocket, and which is a piece of the ship's side—there are two single-barrelled pistols, loaded—they were not loaded when they were found; the second mate loaded them afterwards, by my direction—all the barrels of the revolvers were loaded and capped—here are two bowie knives; a powder flask, nearly full; a bag, containing five boxes of percussion caps, not full; a bag of bullets, some of them of a size to fit the revolvers, and some not; a life preserver; a quantity of loose bullets, sixty or seventy; a bottle of laudanum; and a keg, containing two quarts of brandy—these things were produced in consequence of the search which I directed to be made—after the prisoner was taken into custody, I told him that if he attempted to escape I would shoot him—he was kept in a place of security, and when we arrived at Gravesend he was taken into custody by an officer—as we came into the Channel, I read over to the prisoner, or the surgeon did in my presence, what had been written in the official log book—I have it have—(read; "Friday, Feb. 22, 1856. Mr. Connell, chief officer, reported to me, Captain Sergeant, that Thomas Whittington had spoken to him of a conspiracy to take the ship. 9 A.M., called Thomas Whittington and Walter Bolitho into the cabin, in the presence of Mr. Grey, cabin passenger, when they made the following statement: Walter Bolitho having the forecastle look-out from 8 till 10 P.M., and Thomas Whittington from 10 till 12 P.M., on Monday, Feb. 18, William Lewis, A.B., came and said, 'If the Russians should take us as a prize, how would you like to have a share of that gold yourself?' at the same time holding a pan with brandy. He then again said, 'How would you like your share of it? it can easily be done; there are about two tons of it' I replied, 'I could not think of it' He said, 'I will have another to join; I have pistols; I will shoot the captain and mate, and then shall have twelve shots to spare; I have a keg of brandy and a bottle of laudanum to set the crew to sleep; we can make away with them after securing the captain, ran the ship down to the coast of Peru, and scuttle her, if you two will stick to me; I will sign with my heart's blood a treaty for you to share; you will have nothing to do but stand at the gangway with a pistol; I will manage the cabin; you must shoot the first man that comes out of the forecastle, if they are not sufficiently dosed; by G—, I will have charge of the cabin before Saturday morning, 4 o'clock; it is time the old mate was out of this world.' William Lewis being at this time at the wheel, sent Mr. Harris, the second mate, with Whittington and Bolitho, to seize the arms in his bunk; they exactly agreed with their description of them, consisting of two six-barrel Colt revolvers, loaded, and in perfect order, two single-barrel pistols, two bowie knives, bullets, caps, and powder")—I made that entry on 6th March, copied from one taken down at the time the statement was made—I took it down at the time from their mouths, and afterwards made an accurate copy of it into the log, and read it over to Whittington and Bolitho—I have not

got the other paper; it was taken down in pencil—upon my reading this over to the prisoner, he said it was false—I think that was the substance of what he said—he did not ask anything about his belt; he did at the Thames police court.

Cross-examined. Q. The list of things found in his berth was not mentioned to him at the time, was it? A. No—Harris went with Bolitho and Whittington to find them—I am certain that the prisoner did not come on board the same day that we sailed; I cannot say when he came on board; I was on shore on business; he must have been on board the day before we sailed, because we started early in the morning—the gold was shipped probably four days before sailing—I was present when it was done; the greater part of the crew that were then on board assisted in carrying it on board.

Q. The prisoner complained, did he not, after this statement was read over to him, of 50l. having been taken out of his belt? A. Not till we got before Mr. Yardley, at the Thames police court; that was the first I heard of it—there was a belt, I think it is mentioned in the official log—it appears to be a belt for carrying gold dust and money—the seamen do not carry these kind of knives; they do carry knives, but not bowie knives—we do not search their chests—I never saw them with a bowie knife—I think it is very unusual for a seaman in our service to have a bowie knife—I do not know whether the gold diggers carry them; I have never been to the diggings—the Colt's revolvers are still loaded—I do not know whether there is a difficulty in withdrawing the charge—I kept them loaded to produce—I scarcely know whether or not there is a rule against discharging pistols in the Bay of Melbourne.

MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know anything of a China escort being expected with gold about the time your vessel sailed? A. There was a vessel to sail for Hong Kong with gold—I do not know whether or not the gold had come down from the country—it does come down to the banks under escort.

COURT. Q. Does the gold that you bring home come in dust or in quartz? A. In dust; it is deposited in the after run of the ship, not in my cabin—it does not occupy a great space.





DAVID HARRIS
. I was second mate of the Stebonheath on her homeward passage from Melbourne. On Friday, 22nd Feb., by the captain's direction, I went to the place where the bunks are—I went to the prisoner's bunk, and there found the whole of the things that have been produced—I took them to the captain—I afterwards loaded the two single-barrel pistols by the captain's direction—I kept possession of all these things until the vessel arrived at Gravesend—I then handed them over to inspector White when the prisoner was given into custody.

Cross-examined. Q. Did Whittington and Bolitho point out to you the place in the berth where you found these things? A. Yes, they handed the things out of the bunk, I saw them take them out, I was alongside of them; they were all in a bag except the brandy and the laudanum—this is the bag in which they were.





RICHARD WHITE
 (Thames police inspector.) The prisoner was given into my charge on 24th May, by the captain, on board the vessel, at Gravesend—I told him that he was charged with mutiny, and he must consider himself my prisoner—he made no answer—I received the articles produced from Mr. Harris, in the presence of the captain, in the cuddy—I conveyed the prisoner by rail to London, and took him to the Thames police station,

Wapping, where the charge was taken by superintendant Evans, and read over to the prisoner—I have the charge sheet here, it contains a list of the things I had to take care of—when the part was read which describes the single-barrelled pistols as being loaded, the prisoner said, "I did not load them"—the list describes the revolvers as being loaded, to that he said nothing—when we came to the belt, he said, "There was fifty sovereigns in that belt"—he had not said anything to me about the fifty sovereigns before that—I had travelled with him all the way from Gravesend—I said I would have some inquiry made about it—he said all the articles belonged to him—inspector Shane was with me—I left the prisoner in his custody for a short time at Gravesend, while I went to take the tickets—I handed this bottle to Mr. Boss, it was then full.

Cross-examined. Do you know whether there is not some difficulty in unloading the revolvers? A. I have had them tested and bored at the gun-smith's, and they are loaded with powder and ball—I do not know that there is some difficulty in unloading a revolver after it is once loaded; you can discharge it by firing; without doing so I should think you cannot unload them without boring them, they are forced in so heavily, the leverage is so great—if I did not want to discharge a revolver, I should bore it in order to unload it; you bore them with a piercer, I saw it done at the gunsmith's; you bore through the bullet in order to see that there is powder behind.





JOSEPH SHANE
 (Thames police inspector.) I was with White at Gravesend, when he had the prisoner in custody—he left me with him on the Diamond pier for a short time—I asked him what sort of passage they had had—he said a very good one—he then, said, "They have done it well for me, Whittington ought to be in my place; I have made my mind up, I suppose I shall get for life, it is no use saying nothing."





JOHN BROWN ROSS
. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital I have examined the contents of this bottle which I received from inspector White—it contains laudanum—I have not tested the strength, it appears to be commercial laudanum, which is a little more than half the strength of the best which we use in our hospitals.

Cross-examined. Q. Can you identify the label that is on the bottle? A. No; the only word I can trace is "Brompton"—laudanum is used with other medicines for dysentery, and is a soothing lotion for sore eyes.

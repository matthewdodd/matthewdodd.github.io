            . Between ten and eleven o'clock on Saturday night, the fourth of May, as I was coming from the play-house to the Bedford Arms, in the road, there was rather a stoppage at the corner of Russell-street


, at which time I felt the prisoner gently drawing my watch out of my pocket. I clapt my hand to my fob and catched the watch quite out of my pocket; as soon as he found I had hold of it he quitted it instantly. I knocked him down, then I stept three or four paces back and called Mr. Holt, who was with me, and we took him to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; who committed him.
Q. From the Prisoner. Was your watch out of your pocket?
Moore, Yes; it was.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never offered to meddle with any thing, the gentleman knocked me down, and took me before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . Any body else might be at it as well as me. I am a waiter
 out of place at present.

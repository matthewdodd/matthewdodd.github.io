CHARLES CHAMBERS
. I am a policeman. On the afternoon of the 27th of January, I was on duty at Aldgate, and saw the prisoner—there was a female close behind him—I can't say they were in company—I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out—I seized him, and took it from him—I told the prosecutor, who claimed it—I produce it.





PETER BEAUFILS
. This is may handkerchief—I lost it on the 27th of

January—I did not feel it taken—chambers produced it to me—I had felt it safe about and hour before.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw a gentleman's handkerchief hanging out half way down his legs—I laid hold of it, and was going to tell him it was hanging out, when the officer laid hold of me.

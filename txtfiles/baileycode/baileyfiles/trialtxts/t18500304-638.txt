ROBERT THOMPSON
. I am a tailor, of 184, Strand. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Clement Danes—these coats are mine—the policeman brought these and the prisoner to my house on 4th March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—the coats are worth 5l. 5s.





DANIEL MAY
 (City-policeman, 357). On 4th March I saw the prisoner and another boy in Fleet-street, a little after six o'clock—I watched them—they went to the prosecutor's—the prisoner walked into the shop, and took these five coats—he came out, and I took him with them—the other boy was wasting outside for him.

Prisoner. I did not take them, the other boy took them.




GUILTY
.† Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JANE FREWER. I live in Charles-square, Hoxton. On the 31st of August I was in the City-road


, with 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Wulff
               



            , who is three years and a half old - she is the daughter of George Henry Wulff, and had a coral necklace on, with a gold snap: a little boy came out of a shop, and said a woman had taken the child's necklace off - I looked, missed it, and followed the prisoner; I ran up to her, and asked for the necklace - she said she had not got it, but a woman had brushed by her, and very likely she had it; she offered to help me overtake her, and led me down Hill-street, but as I was carrying one child and leading another she got a good deal a-head of me, and suspecting her, I got a person to stop her - this necklace was found in her right hand; when I first saw her she was not more than ten yards from me.

            . I took the prisoner, and have the necklace.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw the necklace on the ground, and took it up, but did not know whose it was; this young woman said I had taken it - the boy said he could not say it was me.
THOMAS WEST. I saw Frewer going along with a child, and saw the prisoner take the necklace from its neck.

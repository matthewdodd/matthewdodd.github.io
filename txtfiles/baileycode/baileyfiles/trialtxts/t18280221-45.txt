WILLIAM MULLAY. I was in London in January last; and on one day in the beginning of this month, I put an advertisement in the paper; and on the 8th I received a letter, in consequence of which I called on the prisoner, and had some conversation with him. I produced the letter to him; he did not state from whom that letter came, but seemed to know what I came about. I was desirous of procuring some situation, but had not mentioned that it was to be under government: I had provided myself with a sum of money as a premium for it. The place I went to was No. 36, Red Lion-square


; I was shown to a room on the top floor, behind the projection of the building: I had to go up stairs as if I was going to the leads of the house, I then turned off down some other stairs, through a narrow passage, two or three feet wide, which brought me into a room, not more than nine feet square; there is a window in it, and a fire-place which projects; there was a table and two chairs: I got there, I think, about three o'clock on Friday, the 8th of February, and staid there until about four o'clock. He told me he had a friend, who was a man of consequence, and had a great deal of influence, though he had run through a large fortune, and through him he could procure me some employment, and as a beginning of the business, I was to lodge 300l. in a banker's hands in my own name, and to call on him the following day, or on the Monday, to lodge the money, I went the following day and told him I had not brought the money, and told him I thought Monday might do as well. We had some further conversation on the business, and I said I did not care, or it was of no consequence to me if I were to lodge more money. It was then agreed that I should, on the Monday, lodge 450l. On the Monday I called about two o'clock, and told him I had changed my mind, and I would only lodge 300l.: he then observed that his employer would think I was going back from my agreement, and think that he had not acted in a proper manner. On that day I saw a long bladed knife, with a buckhorn handle, which laid open upon the shelf; I cannot say whether it was a clasp knife, as I did not take it in my hand - when the prisoner made these observations, I told him I was always a man of my word, or words to that effect; and I would lodge the 450l. in the course of the day, and to prove it, I showed him 400l. He then made me write a note to a Mr. Owen, which was the first time I had heard the name of "Owen" mentioned; in it I mentioned that I would lodge the 450l., and Howard and I were to call on him at one o'clock the following day, which would be Tuesday: I was to call on the prisoner at half-past twelve o'clock, and go with him to Owen's: we parted about five o'clock. On the next day I went about half-past twelve o'clock, and had upwards of 500l. in two pockets - I had three 100l. Bank notes, two of 50l., a Bank post-bill for 98l., and some sovereigns. At this interview, Howard told me that Mr. Owen had to go to 'Change, and couldnot be at home at one o'clock, but he would call at Howard's at two o'clock, and he begged me to wait till he came, which I consented to do: he made some observations about my being cold; he put some coals on the fire, and put the poker into it; it remained there some time, when it fell out; he put it in again; it remained some time, and I took it out again myself - he put it into the fire again, and observed to me that it would make the fire burn. After some time, it fell out on the hearth-rug and burnt it, and he did not afterwards put it in. I observed in the room a trap bat, which I had not seen before; he had it a good deal in his hand, and said he purchased it to beat, or to keep the cat out of his room - the conversation afterwards turned on various subjects; two o'clock came, Mr. Owen did not appear, but Howard appeared to be every moment expecting him: he did not remain in the room all the time, but went in and out a great deal - as well as I can recollect he walked up and down almost all the time: I told him I wanted to be at home before five o'clock, as I lived at Chelsea, and was going out to dinner. About two o'clock he began to get very agitated, and complained a great deal of Mr. Owen's conduct: I remained till half-past three o'clock, and then told him I could stay no longer, and he proposed that there should be a new appointment made to meet Mr. Owen, and it was agreed that I should call on Howard at ten o'clock, or as soon after as I could, on the following day: this was to be communicated to Owen by a note, which I wrote; when I had done, I showed it to Howard, who said that I ought to have made it a good deal sharper, or words to that effect; and, after a few observations he sat down and wrote one for me to copy - this note is not here, but here is a part of my copy of it: the note he wrote was a long one, and in that he stated that we should call at ten o'clock at Owen's; I said "How can we go to Owen's at ten o'clock, when I am to be here at ten o'clock" - he replied"You are peevish;" I said "on some occasions I might be so." I sat down and commenced the copy of the note, and had nearly finished it, when I saw my hat (which had hung on a nail behind me) in Howard's hand, and he put it either on a chair at the other corner of the room, or threw it on the floor; he immediately came back again behind me, as I was leaning down to write, and hit me at the top of the head with the bat - it immediately occured to me that he intended to murder, and rob me; I got up, he came more in front of me, and hit me with the bat on my forehead - it bled immediately over my face, so much so as to dim my sight with the blood: I immediately closed upon him and threw him; he fell, I think sideways, for his left hand was stretched out, and I observed in it a knife, which appeared to me to be the one I had previously seen; I laid hold of it by the blade: he had fallen about three or four feet from the fire-place, and while I had hold of the knife with one hand, I stretched out the other and got hold of the poker, with which I gave him some blows on the head: he had all this time hold of the handle of the knife, and, by holding the blade, my hand began to be cut: I then threw the poker out of my hand to lay hold of the blade with my right hand, my left being cut - in doing that he got up: we were still struggling, but I did not fall at all; he still had hold of the handle of the knife, and I had only hold of the blade; when he first began on me, I cried "Murder," and he told me in the course of the struggle, it was no use to bawl or cry, as he had help at hand, or words to that effect, and on one or two occasions, he called "John, John" - when we were up, I got hold of the bat, and gave him some blows with it in front of his head, but I let go of the bat, as my whole attention was on the knife, and in a short time I broke the blade off near the handle, and held it in my own hand for perhaps a minute or two, thinking it might be of some service to defend myself, but I found I could not use the blade, and I threw it on the floor. I cannot well say how the prisoner held the handle of the knife, but he held it firmly, and I could not get, but broke it - the knife was in motion when I broke it; I had then nothing in my hand to defend myself, I threw him again, and began to kick him with my heel: about that time there were people at the door; I heard them speak, but the door was locked - he had passed in and out frequently; he had not locked it every time, nor do I know when he had locked it - I did not observe whether I found the door locked on my former visits, but on one occasion (I think on the Monday) I told him to shut the door, which was open, and it appeared to me to have no other means of fastening, but by turning the key. When the people came to the door, I thought they came to help Howard, and he asked me to let him get up, and said he would tell me all about it; I did so, but still held him: he appeared greatly agitated or exhausted, I cannot tell which, and said to me "Will you promise me one thing?" or words to that effect: I asked him what it was; he did not reply for some time, and I asked him again - he then said, "Will you say it was a quarrel?" and, under the idea that he had help outside the door, I promised him I would. We then went and unlocked the door, and I saw the landlord of the house, or the man who keeps the shop; and a painter, whom I had seen in the house, going backwards and forwards, and two other persons; I then felt at ease as to any danger, and came out of the room, and said that Howard had made an attempt to murder me; some one then came down stairs with me, and I showed my money to the first person I spoke to, to the constable, and to the surgeon. When I went into that room I had a ring on my finger, and, when I came out, I found myself without it; I have seen it since, and I have seen a bat and a knife similar to those I saw in the room. My wounds were dressed, and I was sent home.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been from Ireland? A. About three months: I had been in England frequently before, and had advertised for some employment, but I do not think I had advertised for a public situation; I had advertised for a mercantile one about four times; not more. The prisoner said I was peevish, and occasionally I am so, if I see a person do an absurd thing; but, if I thought a fraud was about to be practised on me, or I were to be made the dupe of another person, that would not be likely to rouse my peevish feelings. I can state, on my oath, that I was not peevish on that occasion: and the prisoner had no reason for making that observation. My note will show that I did not consider that Mr. Owen was ill treating me, nor did I think that Howard was; I did not consider that the delay was extraordinary. The lodging, into which I went, was in a very obscure situation; there was a pillar and claw table and two chairs in the room: there might be other things, but theroom was very scantily furnished - but the furniture was very clean. The whole sum I was to give was something between 500l. and 800l. It did not strike me that this was rather an extraordinary place to go to for the purpose of seeing an influential person or his agent - Howard said I was to meet him there. The only thing that struck me was, that it was a very quiet place, and a curious one; the passage to it is about three feet wide. I think the first time I showed the prisoner the money I had in my pocket, was on the Monday; I did not show him any on the Tuesday, and I cannot exactly tell whether any conversation took place between me and him respecting money on Tuesday: the first conversation respecting the banker's was on the Monday, and on the Tuesday he was making an observation on Mr. Owen's going with me to the banker's, and he was consulting me to know whether he would be wanted to go, he said if I chose he would go: he did not ask me any questions that morning to induce me to show him the money; my going to any banker's, was to depend on whether Mr. Owen came. I think I got there on the Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock, and, when I came out of the room it was about four o'clock. I never described the bat as a cricket bat: there had been some coals put on the fire before he put the poket in: I did not state before the magistrate that after he put the poker in the fire, I, myself, drew it out twice; or that he put it in twice, and that I drew it out as often: he put it in three times and I drew it out once - I am quite positive that I did not on that Tuesday drink anything with him; on the Monday I drank some gin and water, which he asked me to do, as I appeared wet: I think I was not wet on the Tuesday; there might be a splash on me. I do not mean to state that his saying I was cold, and putting the poker into the fire, was a circumstance calculated to alarm me; in fact, it did not alarm me - I have never said it did. I was the only person in the room with him; when the poker fell from the fire the second time and burnt the hearth-rug he took it into his hand and put it under the ashes, or by the side of the fire-place; very circumstance, with reference to it, was of an ordinary nature, till I took hold of it: I did not on the two previous days take particular notice of the room and its appendages. The bat and the knife might have been there on the Friday and Saturday, but I did not see them till the Monday. I was writing when I saw my hat in the prisoner's hand, but I did not see him take it down, as it was behind me; it might have fallen. It is a very small room; if he had intended to rob me, he might have stuck me to the heart with the knife. I did not, at the last meeting, express great indignation at Owen for not coming, and never said it was all a "humbug." Howard was making some observations on him for not coming, but I never joined, for up to the time I was attacked, I considered the transaction bona fide.
Q. Now, Sir, upon the oath you have taken, and recollecting your back was to the prisoner when you were first struck, was it not a blow with the fist? A. No! that I will swear - it was a very severe blow, but I was not stunned- when I turned round, the prisoner had the bat in his right hand; he appears to be a weaker man than I - I threw him twice, and the only difficulty I had in any part of the transaction was, to get the knife; he had the knife in his left hand; I could hold the knife and reach the poker, with which I gave him, perhaps, three blows with a good deal of force on the head; I cannot well tell whether the knife continued in his left hand, but I had it occasionally in both hands, and always by the blade; the first time I saw it in his hand was the moment he fell - he did not fall near the shelf, where I had seen it lay - that I will swear; he had the bat in his right hand when he fell - he did not fall from a blow - I threw him; I had not the poker in my hand at the time he fell; when the persons were at the door, he did not add that he would give me satisfaction when and where I liked; he did not state that he bought the bat as a present to his landlord's child that I remember, though I will not swear he did not; a black cat did come into the room, and he used the bat to drive it out - I will not swear that he did not say at the time, that the bat had been bought for a different ball than so black a one and it would answer the purpose as well as any thing else - he might have said so, but I have no knowledge of it; he might have sat down with me, but I swear that the greater part of the time he was walking about - he appeared agitated and irritated, and accounted for it by the absence of Owen; as well as I can remember, I stated before the Magistrate that, in the course of struggle, he called, "John John;" I am almost positive that I did; I cannot call to my mind whe ther any one said at the door that they would burst it open, if it were not opened - it might have been said; I have not examined the premises since; I cried Murder! loudly, but I do not know whether it was heard at the next house - I do not know whether I could have overpowered the prisoner; I admit that I broke the knife before I threw him for the last time; I cannot tell how long a time elapsed between my going out of the room and securing the prisoner, for I was below stairs - I cannot tell whether he was left alone; I did not mind whether I saw any persons in the house when I went to meet him on the Tuesday; when he asked me to say it was a quarrel, I promised to do so, under the supposition that his friends were at hand; I do not think that, in the agitation of the moment, I could have been mistaken, as to the expressions he used in respect of help; I cannot say which of the two were most wounded; there was some conversation about bills, but the 450l. was bona fide to be left.
MR. LAW. Q. A surgeon attended you? A. Yes, and I showed him the state I was in; I was not wounded in any respect when I went there.

                  FREDERICK CHEESE
               



            . I live at No, 36, Red Lion-square; the prisoner lodged in the house, and occupied two attics, I believe - I think he had entered on his fourth week. On the day of this transaction, I went up stairs, about four o'clock, upon hearing the cry of Murder! I returned and procured the poker, and, in my passage up again, I asked a painter to go up with me, which he did; I went to the door of the prisoner's apartment, where I heard a scuffling; I knocked, and demanded the cause of it - a dead silence ensued for a few moments, when I heard a half-suppressed voice pronounce the words, "Will you premise -?" I then demanded admittance more loudly than before; some one from within desired me to retire, saying it was only a quarrel, and all settled; I said I should like two voices to tell me that it was settled; the assertion was then repeated, by the same voice, that all was settled, but, on myasserting that I had persons with me who would not be satisfied without admittance, the door was immediately unlocked- I opened the door, and took the prosecutor down stairs to a back kitchen, or rather scullery; he said he had 500l. about him, but I did not see him produce it from his pocket. Cooke, the constable, took the prisoner into custody; when he was taken, I heard him express that, which would lead us to conclude that they had only been quarrelling, he said he thought it unfair that the prosecutor's individual evidence should be received in preference to his own, and they ought to have been allowed to fight it out fair - I do not recollect that the prosecutor made any complaint in his presence about what had happened; the prisoner and prosecutor were both wounded, and the prosecutor was bleeding copiously - I recollect the prisoner saying that the circumstance of the door being locked was against him, but he endeavoured to explain it, by saying that there was no other fastening to the door, and the lock being inside, he had locked it to prevent the inconvenience of sitting in a draught - he had locked it; he stated that he had been accused of assaulting the prosecutor, but made no direct reply; I have a ring, which I received from a little boy, who is now in Court.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he say that circumstances were against him; or that they appeared against him? A. That they were against him, and he accounted for it by stating that the door was locked, but that that was the only way of fastening it; I stated at the door that I would not be put off with the reply which I had heard; and, to the best of my judgment, it was the same voice said, "It is only a quarrel," as said, "Will you promise?" there was no contradiction made by any other voice, though I had explained the object of my coming - the prisoner all along stated that it had been a quarrel; I do not remember that any thing was said to me by any one when the door was first opened; I took hold of the prosecutor's hand, and took him down stairs; in going down, I asked what it was about, and he said the man had attempted to murder him - he never assented to the representation of the prisoner, that it was a quarrel; he told but one story from beginning to end; to the best of my belief, the prisoner was left alone up stairs - he was apprehended in about half an hour, but he could not well have escaped, as there were persons at the door, and on the stairs.
JURY. Q. Why did you take the prosecutor to the kitchen in preference to any other part of the house? A. Because I generally occupy the kitchen for my family, and knowing that his wounds wanted washing I took him there.

                  COOKE
               



            . I am a constable, and live at No. 33, Red Lion-square; I was sent for between three and four o'clock, and the prosecutor gave me the prisoner in charge; I went into the sitting-room, occupied by the prisoner, where I found this bat - I saw a poker there, and the glass of the window was broken; I searched the prisoner, and found on him 5d. in halfpence; I went into his bed-room, and found a hat, a cap, a waistcoat, two old shirts, two or three pairs of stockings, and a few collars; I saw the door which leads to the leads of the house, and found marks of blood on it - that door fastens with two bolts; I did not find any knife in the room, but I told the prisoner what the prosecutor had said about a knife, and his answer was, that he wished he had thrown away every d - d thing that was bloody; I found the papers produced under the grate, in the prisoner's bed-room, not in the sitting room; I found another paper folded up, on the table, in the sitting-room; I looked for the knife on the roofs of the houses that day, but could not find it for the snow; I went again the next day, and found the handle on the roof of No. 34, and the blade on the roof of No. 38; this is the knife - it is what is called a Spanish knife.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was any body with you when you took the prisoner? A. Yes, Mr. Izard- I took him about four o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can tell; I believe no one had hold of him - he was up in his room; and, as I was informed by some one that he had a dagger, I went home and provided myself with a cutlass, and went back and took him.
MR. LAW. Q. Have you examined the knife? A. Yes; it is sharp on both sides - I saw the prosecutor had two wounds on his head, and his clothes were very bloody.

                  BARBER
               



            . I am a chemist, and live at No.7, Orange-street, Red Lion-square. I was applied to for the prosecutor, on the day of the transaction; I found he had a wound on the top of his head, another over his right eye, and his hands were severely cut; the wound on the top of his head was of a triangular form, and there was a slight crack on the top of the skull - it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this bat, and I should think it was done by this round part of it - it was done by a blunt instrument; the wound on the eye was a contused wound, done apparently with the edge of the bat: the cuts on the hand had been evidently produced by clasping some sharp instrument - they were just at the bend of the fingers in the left hand, and the outside of the thumb of the right hand was cut also; the wounds were such, that a person grasping a blade might have received. I dressed the prisoner's wounds afterwards - they were on the back part of his head, and appeared to be caused by a fall; I said to him, "How came you in such an affray as this?" he said, "It was merely a quarrel - he called my friend a humbug." I saw the prosecutor's money - there was nearly 500l.
COURT. Q. Should you think the wounds on the prosecutor's hand were inflicted by his endeavouring to wrest the knife from the prisoner? A. I should think they were.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were all the wounds on the prisoner such as you suppose were occasioned by a fall? A. Yes, except one cut on his hand, and a blow on the side of his head; I bound up the prosecutor's wounds with proper bandages; the wound over the eye was the worst; I do not think there was any danger from either of the wounds - the wounds on the top of the head might have been dangerous had it been inflicted with a heavier instrument; the wound on the back of the prisoner's head was from a severe blow, but it did not present to me an appearance of having received three or four blows with a poker; I, however, do not consider myself competent to decide that.
MR. LAW. Q. Suppose a person to have hold of a cutting instrument in his left hand, might he not, by that means, have been disabled, in some measure, from using his right hand? A. Yes.

                  DAVIS
               



            . I am a surgeon. I examined the prosecutor's wounds - they were on a part of the head wherethey might have been dangerous - the wound over the eye bled very much; they were such as I would attribute rather to this bat than to a pugilistic contest.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Has it ever been in your experience to examine a person who has been in a pugilistic contest? A. Yes, and I have found bleeding wounds from blows on the head in that case; I do not consider that the prosecutor's life was ever in danger.
COURT. Q. Was the wound on the back of the head a contused wound? A. Yes; the wound over the eye was an incised wound - it was a cleaner cut than the other - I should think it might have been inflicted with the edge of this bat; there are different sorts of wounds, what we call lacerated, contused, and incised wounds, and some partaking of the nature of two of these wounds; if I were speaking as a surgeon, I should denominate the wound over the forehead as an incised wound; there was very little contusion in that wound, from there being more integuments over the eye; I should call it an incised wound, produced by some sharper instrument than that which inflicted the other wound; or from the edge of that instrument; the blunt part could not have made such a wound; there was no swelling accompanying the wound on the eye, and very little discolouration; I saw the prosecutor the same evening, and am still in attendance on him.

            . I found this ring in the front kitchen, on the Friday following - I do not know whether Mr. Mullay had been washing there or not.
The prisoner, in an exceedingly long address to the Court, stated that Owen and himself, being in had circumstances, had determined to answer the prosecutor's advertisement, and persuade him to lodge a sum of money in a banker's hands in the joint names of Owen and the prosecutor's; conceiving that Owen could then make the banker's a house of reference, and by that means to obtain goods on credit to a considerable amount; that he was appointed to conduct the negotiation. He then entered into a minute detail of his several interviews with Mr. Mullay, who was willing to deposit the sum; that on the day in question, Mr. Mullay called for the purpose of meeting Owen, who did not fulfil his engagement; that he had only placed the poker in the fire for the purpose of making it burn brighter: Mr. Mullay began to express his disappointment at Owen not coming, and he advised his writing a note; that he had bought the bat, to present to his landlady's child, in return for her attention to him when ill. Mr. Mullay at last displayed much anger at Owen's not arriving, and stated that he was humbugged; and the prisoner, feeling irritated at such language, struck him in the face with his fist; Mr. Mullay then seized the poker, and the prisoner the bat, when a scuffle ensued, and both were alternately on the ground: in the scuffle a knife was knocked off the mantel-shelf, and the prisoner, fearing Mr. Mullay might seize it, took it up himself; the prosecutor gave him several violent blows on the head and body with the poker, and, supposing the prisoner might use the knife to defend himself, called Murder! during the scuffle the prisoner succeeded in breaking the knife against the wainscoat, and put both blade and handle into his pocket. The alarm having brought the neighbours up, the prisoner observed to the prosecutor that it was necessary an explanation should be given, as he had called murder; to which he assented, and the prisoner opened the door, and the prosecutor stated to the persons assembled that they had been quarrelling. He declared the only object he had was, to have the money deposited at the banker's, in order to make them his house of reference; and appealed to the Court, whether it was possible he could expect to overcome a person of the prosecutor's strength; that he had only acted in self-defence; and concluded by solemnly appealing to the Almighty for the truth of his statement.

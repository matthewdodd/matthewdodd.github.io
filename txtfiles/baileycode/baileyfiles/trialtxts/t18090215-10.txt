            ; no other persons are interested in the business but myself and them three. The prisoner was our servant, he had been our servant
 about four years; some time since we received information that we were robbed by our labourers, which led us to watch the labourers; in general we saw the prisoner and another labourer go to the house of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Hayward
               



            , No. 23, Charterhouse street. On Friday night last, in consequence of suspicion, we were induced to get the police officers to attend the premises against the time the labourers left work, which was about eight o'clock in the evening, and after they went out they were instantly brought into my partner's house, and the search of their persons commenced instantly. On the prisoner was found three cakes of soap placed in the waistband of his breeches before, two half cakes from his pockets, and two half cakes were in the crown of his hat; upon this being found in his possession he begged for mercy, and said it was the first time he had committed any offence of that sort.

Q. In what part of your manufactory would cakes of soap be deposited - A In the cutting room.
Q. What weight was this altogether - A. As near as possible fourteen pounds; they are laid in the indictment at twelve; the wholesale value would be about fifteen shillings; nothing was found on the other labourer.

            . At the time the men came out I was stationed at the gate; I stationed myself there in order to identify these men as they came out; I told the officer they were the men. On their being searched I saw the soap taken from the prisoner; he went down upon his knees and said he was a most ungrateful man, he was sorry for what he had done. He was a confidential servant, he used to lock up the premises.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner as he was coming out of the gate into the dwelling house, and searched him; - these three cakes of soap were found in his waistband of his breeches, and there was in his hat a cake broke in half, and the other was in his pocket; I also found upon him a memorandum on paper of soap, and two guineas.
Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say; they took three guineas and a half that does not belong to this.

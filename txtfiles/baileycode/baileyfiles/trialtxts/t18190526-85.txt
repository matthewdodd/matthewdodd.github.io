            . I am a publican
, and live in White Conduit-street. On the 22d of May, I lost this lead from the gutters of two houses, which belong to me - it was brought to me; I compared it with the building, and it fitted exactly in every part.

            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of May, about five o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and saw the prisoner and two others coming down the road; I stopped till they came opposite to me. The middle man then threw some lead down and ran away - the prisoner was the first man, and had the greatest part of the lead in a bag; he threw it down and ran. I pursued him and a man stopped him. He threw himself down; I collared him, and took him to the watch-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

JAMES SWAIN. I am a butcher
 in Newgate Market


. On the 1st of December, the prisoner came into my shop, and bought a pair of fore-quarters of mutton; he laid it on the block to chop it; I saw him lay down the chopper, and take up a piece of pork; and then he took another piece up -he placed them on the mutton, and in his tray. I followed him out, and took him; he had paid for the mutton, but had also got 12lbs. of pork. He is a butcher.

JOHN SMITH
 and 




JAMES THOMAS
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 purse, value 1s., of a certain woman unknown, from her person.






MICHAEL HAT DON
 (City police-constable, No. 274.) About twelve o'clock on the 6th of Nov. I saw the two prisoners following ladies up and down Ludgate-hill—I watched them for a quarter of an hour—at length I saw Smith go to the right hand side of a lady, who was going down the hill—he put his left hand into her pocket, walked two or three yards, and at length drew his hand out and looked down at it—Thomas was at the time covering Smith by swinging and opening the skirts of his coat, holding them open with his hand—Smith went off—I overtook him and threw him down—I said, "Hand me over what you took from that lady—quick"—he put his hand in his pocket and took out this purse and 3d.—there was nothing in the purse—I returned to look for the lady—she was gone—I do not know who she was.

Smith. The purse was my own and the 3d. too.

Taylor. I got to the top of Ludgate-hill, and I met this lad—I said, "Have you seen anybody go along with a barrow?"—he said, "No"—I

left him and went on to market—I did not buy anything—I was coming back and going to Farringdon-market, when this officer took me.

 (police-constable R 180.) I produce a certificate of Smith's former conviction, by the name of George Williams, at this court—(read—Convicted the 7th of April, 1845, and confined three months)—Smith is the person.

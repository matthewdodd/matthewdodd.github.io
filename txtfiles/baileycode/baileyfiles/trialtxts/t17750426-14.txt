            . I live at a place called Northolt


. My house was broke open last Monday se'nnight at night. I was at Watford, I went on Sunday, and returned on Tuesday about seven in the evening. When I came home, I found the house open: there was no marks of violence. The prisoners owned they got in at a window.

            . I am sister to the last witness: I was at Watford with my brother when the house was broke open. The goods mentioned in the indictment were produced: and deposed to by 
               
                  Henry
                   Jackson

            . I am one of the patrole. I stopped the prisoners with these bundles upon them in Oxford Street, on Tuesday the 18th; the constable has had them ever since.

            . I am a constable. I received these things that have been produced, from the last witness, and have had them in my custody till now . I took the prisoners before the justice; I found a knife upon the man, with which, he said, he had broke open two boxes, in Mr. Jackson's house, at Northolt. He said, the woman had been there to nurse Mr. Jackson, in the small pox: that they got a ladder from the hay-rick, by which they got into the house; but the woman denied it, till the people came, then she confessed it, and craved mercy: we took coach, and went down and found the ladder there, as they had said; and the things were missing out of the house.

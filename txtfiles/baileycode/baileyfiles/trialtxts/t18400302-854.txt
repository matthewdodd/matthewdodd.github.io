WILLIAM BLAKE
 and 




WILLIAM HERRING
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
15th of February, 6 pairs of stockings, value 9s., the goods of 



John Wills and another.






WILLIAM ATWOOD
 (police-constable E 88.) On the 15th of February I was on duty, and saw the two prisoners coming down George-street, St. Giles's, in company—Blake had this bundle under his arm—it was about ten o'clock in the morning—I went over and asked Blake what he had got—he made no answer—I took it, and found in it these stockings—I took the prisoners to the station-house, and asked where they had got them—Blake said he picked them up—I asked where they had slept the night before—they said, at the straw-yard, in Whitecross-street—I said, "I suppose you came down Long-lane and up Holborn"—"No," said Blake, "we came down Cheap side"—I said, "I suppose you picked them up there"—Blake said, "Yes, nearly opposite the Old Jewry"—I went and

made inquiry, and found Mr. Wills in the Poultry had lost them—these are the stockings—the shop mark is on them—(producing them.)





JOSEPH CARPENTER
. I am assistant to Mr. John Wills and another—I know these stockings to be their property—they were inside the door of the shop—they have the mark on them now—we do not sell them with the mark on them—we missed them when our attention was drawn to it.

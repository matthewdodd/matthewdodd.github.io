             thus depos'd, Coming home between 2 and 3 o'Clock in the Morning , the Prisoner crossed the Way to me, and said she would see me home; and immediately put her Hand in my Pocket, and I lost my Money; am certain I had it just before, it being two half Crowns: I miss'd it soon after she left me, and inquired of the Watchman a fter her; and going to Stocks-Market , see the Prisoner and two Soldiers , go into an Ale-House cross the Market, and I went to see, that I might be sure it was the Same Person before I charged her; and I am sure that the Prisoner at the Bar, is the Woman that came cross the Way to me, and took my Money in a Minute's time.
The Prisoner in her Defence said, she had been at Westminster with her Husband, and going into a House in Stocks-Market , saw the Prosecutor sitting between two Chimney-Sweepers, that soon afterwards she had an occasion to go out to do what no body could do for her; the Prisoner came to her, and offered her half a Crown to buy some Rods to whip him with, and that she told him she whipt no Body besides her Children; she had not one Person to call to her Reputation, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

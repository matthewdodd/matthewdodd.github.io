            ; I live in Vine-yard, Aldersgate-street


.
Where did you lose these articles mentioned in the indictment from? - From before the house, on the 18th of February; I did not see the prisoner take them; I saw them there at seven o'clock in the evening; and I saw them again at Guildhall the next day.

             sworn.
I live in Mrs. Sadler's house; I saw the things under the prisoner's arm, in the yard, within about thirty yards of the house; an acquaintance of mine heard a man cry out stop thief! he got him; the prisoner was out of my sight when stopped, but not out of the yard; it appeared to be a shirtsleeve hanging down, for he took them all together, rope and all; I did not observe what the other things were; I did not see the prisoner's face, but I saw his size that instant I went down stairs; I believe it is the same man I saw; he had the same coat on.

             sworn.
I am a coachman, and live in Vine-yard, and went out to mend my whip; coming back I met two fellows running very fast, and the prisoner at the bar behind; I stopped him, and searched him; he had some wet linen in his arms; we had a bit of a struggle; I gave it to Couchman the constable; I received this from Mr. Sadler; I gave it to Couchman the constable, on the 18th, about seven in the evening.

                   SADLER
               



             sworn.
Did you see the man take these things? - I heard a rattle at the line; Mr. Smith cried out; I then went into the yard, and laid hold of the prisoner; he had not the things; they were given to the constable; they never was given to me.

(The linen produced and deposed to by Mr. Smith.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was coming down Aldersgate-street gateway, from easing myself; I saw two men drop these things, and I picked them up; and this man came up and stopped me.

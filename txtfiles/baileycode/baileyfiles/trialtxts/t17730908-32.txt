            . I lost a skiff and a pair of sculls; the prisoner was found in it; I saw it about an hour before it was missing; there was a little boy in it about eight years old; when we come on shore we generally make it fast with a chain. Mr. Titcher brought it; he knew it by seeing my name on the scull.

            . My servant saw the prisoner bringing a person ashore in it at two in the morning; we saw some ropes of mine in it and stopped it; he said it was his boat and he was about his business.

            . I saw the prisoner come on shore with the skiff and a gentleman in it; the gentleman gave him 2 d. I asked him where he got the skiff; he said it was his own; I said I did not believe it, and he must go on shore with me; I took him on shore, and called my master. As we were taking him before the Justice he got away; I took him again next morning.

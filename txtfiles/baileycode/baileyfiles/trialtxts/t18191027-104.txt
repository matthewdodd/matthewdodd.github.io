            . I am a whitesmith
, and live in Long-alley, Moorfields


. Last Friday was a week, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, my boy cried out that two men had run away with my fowls; he said he knew one of the men. I dressed myself, went in pursuit, and found the prisoner in company with five others, at the corner of Worship-street - the boy said he was the man. I went up, and asked him how he could rob me? he called me a bad name, and said he would knock my head off. I collared him, he tried to get away - he then said he would pay me for the fowls. I said if he had robbed me, I dare say he had some grits in his pocket; he immediately pulled some grits out, and threw them all about the watch-house. The officer found one of my fowls in his breeches.

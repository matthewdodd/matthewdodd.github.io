            . On Saturday, the 30th of October, about one o'clock at noon, I was in Cecil-court


; when I was at the end of the court a person called out,
"They have picked your pocket, Sir!" I put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief. I turned round, the prisoner was close at my left side. The people said,
"He has got your handkerchief." I put my hand into his jacket, and it fell from it. Another person said,
"It is at your feet." I looked, and saw it behind the prisoner, on the ground; Nicholson seized him.

            . I was in Cecil-court. Four persons were following the prosecutor, who had his umbrella up. A person observed to me that they were after no good. As soon as the prosecutor came to the end of the court, the prisoner went up to him and took his handkerchief out - I collared him, and called to the prosecutor, the others ran off. I put my hand to the prisoner's breast, and the handkerchief was gone - I found it on the ground.

            . I live in Bull's Head-court


. On Sunday morning, the 8th of February, the prisoner came to my house, about nine o'clock in the morning, and asked if we would give her a breakfast, which we did - we knew her before; she pleaded poverty, and was going to stop dinner. I went out for a rabbit, leaving her and my wife together - I returned in a quarter of an hour, and she was gone. I looked into the tea-caddy on the mantle-piece, and missed a sovereign, which was there when I went out, as I had given my wife a shilling from the caddy. I saw her on the Tuesday following, and asked how she could do it; she said she had spent part of it, and lost part.

            . I apprehended her on Tuesday evening; she said she had spent the sovereign, and lost part of it. She was concealed behind a door.

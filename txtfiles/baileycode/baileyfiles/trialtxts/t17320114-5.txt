            . The Prisoner has ply'd at my Shop to carry out Goods some Years, on the 24th of December, Israel Coats, who keeps a Chandler's-Shop in Hart-street, Covent Garden , left Word for her to come to his House to Breakfast, and bring something good with her at she used to do, but better than what she brought last . My Apprentice ask'd the Prisoner's Girl Saily , what good Things her Mother used to carry to Mr. Coats's ? and the Child said, whole Cheeses. When the Prisoner came in, he told her that Coats would have he bring something good as she used to do. Oh! she says, I know what he means, - 'tis Dog's-meat. As soon as I was inform'd of this, I sent my Man to Coats's , under pretence of buying some Cheese, to see if he could find any with my mark, and he brought back Coats himself, and this Cheese, which I knew to be mine by my mark DXP; Coats confess'd he bought this and three more of the Prisoner.

             . By my Master's Orders I went to Coats's House, and there found this Cheese, which I knew to be my Master's by the mark. When the Prisoner was apprehended she fell on her Knees, begg'd Pardon, and confess'd she had stolen this and 3 more.
The Prisoner made no Defence, and the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

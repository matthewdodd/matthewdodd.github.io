            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Pitfield-street, Hoxton


. On the 6th of January, about five o'clock in the evening my boy alarmed me; I had set him to watch; he said a piece of stuff on a pile was moved; he called out again presently, and found it moved further, and immediately after he called out, Stop thief. I rushed out and saw the prisoner, who was running, throw it down. I secured him.

            . I am in the prosecutor's service, and was watching the goods. I saw the stuff on the pile moved twice, which was taken quite off the third time, and run away with. I gave an alarm; my master ran out and followed the man. I picked it up.

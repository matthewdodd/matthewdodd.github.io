            . I left my Frock and Waistcoat in my Room, hanging upon a Pin, when I went out; and about eight or nine o'Clock I missed it - it was up three Pair of Stairs; and I believe the Person that took it, must come in at the Window, by a Leaden Gutter - I never saw the Prisoner before he was taken.

            . Sept. 28 about eight o'Clock in the Evening, the Prisoner pledged this Coat with me; I asked him whose it was, he said, it was his own; said I, it is too big for you; and, he said, he bought it second Hand in Monmouth-street; I showed it to Mr Blackford; he suspected the Prisoner, as coming after a young Man that lodged in the House.

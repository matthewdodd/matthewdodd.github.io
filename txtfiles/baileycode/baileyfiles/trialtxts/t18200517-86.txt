            . I am an attorney
, and live in Broad-court, Long-acre


; the prisoner had been my clerk
 two years. I took him by assignment from Mr. Fletcher, and entrusted him to receive money on my account. I expected Mr. Pownall to pay some money atmy office on account of an action. About the middle of September I went into the country, when I came to town again I found he had been gone sometime without any intimation of his going. I offered a reward, and he was brought to me in March last. I discovered he had received 47 l. 12 s. which he never accounted to me for.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. He was in distress - A. He was; I advanced money for him on his brother's security. He had no protector but myself.

            . I am an attorney, and live in Staples Inn. On the 25th of September I paid Mr. Whitaker's clerk 47 l. 12 s. at my chambers; the prisoner is so much altered in dress and manners, that I have no recollection of him - he wrote the receipt, which I produce, in my presence. I paid him some 10 l. notes, also two 1 l. notes. He called on me for the money, and I paid him.
MR. WHITAKER re-examined. The receipt is the prisoner's writing.

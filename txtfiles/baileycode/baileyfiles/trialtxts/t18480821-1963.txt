HENRY WOOD
 (police-sergeant, K 23). On 14th July the prisoner was given in my charge for stealing two sovereigns from John Wood, who was in the room—she said she was down the court with him, but did not rob him—while he was giving his account, she struck him in the eve, and called him a

black b—r—she said she had his money, and he should not have it—I heard him state that his name was John Wood—he is gone to sea.

Prisoner. I said nothing of the kind.





WILLIAM HAMS
 (police-sergeant, K 21). I was present when the charge was nude—the prisoner jumped up and struck the prosecutor—he said, "I would not have gone down such a place with you, I know you are a thief—I rent to * and you came and robbed me"—the prisoner said, "You black b—r I had your money, take that." and struck him—she said, "Old fellow if you stop to prosecute me you will lose your ship."





THOMAS WATKINS
 (policeman K 310). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted June, 1847, having been before convicted—confined one year)—she is the person.

            . I am employed in the Custom-house
, and live at Stepney. On the 27th of April, I was in Whitechapel, with my wife and children. The prisoner came up, pushed against me, and drew my watch out. I collared him, and asked him for my watch-my wife called out Stop thief! - I still held him, and am sure he is the man.

            . We were returning home-the prisoner ran against my husband, who said he had taken his watch, and he collared him. A short man came close to the prisoner and ran off directly. He was quite close enough to receive the watch from the prisoner.

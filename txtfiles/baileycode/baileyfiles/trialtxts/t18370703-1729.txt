JOHN WILLIAM WEST
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of July, at 


St. Mary, Newington, 2 goblets, value 3l. 10s.; 1 mug, value 1l.; 2 spoons, value 10s.; and 1 fork, value 10s.; the goods of 



Samuel Richard Heseltine, in his dwelling-house.






ELIZABETH CLAYDON
. I am in the service of Samuel Richard Heseltine, who lives in Church-street row, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the 1st of July, about twenty minutes after one o'clock, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came and asked if Mr. Heseltine was at home—I said, no—he asked if Miss Heseltine was at home—I said she was not, but I expected them in

five minutes—I asked him into the parlour—I observed the plate was all right on the sideboard—I was cleaning the green-house—the prisoner came to me and said he wished to leave; that he was going to see Mr. Edey, and would call as he came back—I opened the door and let him out—I then went into the parlour, and missed the fork off table, and saw the sideboard looked naked—I looked out, and the prisoner was passing—I went to him, and said I had missed a fork off the table, and he had got it—he said, "I beg your pardon; I did not mean to do so;" and he gave me the fork out of his pocked—I told him I would charge the policeman with him, as he had got more—he said he had not—I took hold of him, and asked a gentleman to take care of him, while I got the policeman—I did so, and saw this property taken from him, which is my master's.





ROBERT MELVILLE
 (police-constable C 104.) I took the prisoner, and found these two silver goblets in his hat, this mug in his pocket, and two spoons.
(The prisoner put in a petition for a lenient sentence, in consequence of the property having been restored.)

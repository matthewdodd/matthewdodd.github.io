ANDREW SPENCE. I am a sailor
. I was close alongside of Newgate


 on the 16th of May, about ten or eleven o'clock - I had a handkerchief in my left pocket; I did not know I had lost it till it was given to me by a woman. The prisoner had run away, but was caught.
Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the woman here? A. No. This handkerchief is like mine, but it has been with others - I cannot swear it is the handkerchief the woman gave me.
COURT. Q. Was the handkerchief given by the woman your's? A. Yes - I knew it at the time - there is no mark upon it.

            . I am a wine-merchant. I was going along Newgate-street on the 16th of May, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor, and put it into his own pocket; I informed the prosecutor, and kept my eye upon the prisoner, who, I think, observed me, for he dropped the handkerchief, and ran - I saw it picked up.
Cross-examined. Q. Who picked it up? A. I do not know - I was more intent on watching the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it.

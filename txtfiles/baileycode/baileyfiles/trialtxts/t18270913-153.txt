             - we live in Carnaby-market


 - the prisoner lodged with us. On the 20th of July I missed the counterpane, two sheets, a blanket, and bolster, which I had let to her with the lodging; she had been taken, I believe, on another charge - the officer came to my house, and we went into her apartment - I then missed this property.

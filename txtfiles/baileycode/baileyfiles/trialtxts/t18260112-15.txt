GEORGE PROSSER. I am a dyer
, and lodge in Fashion-street, Bethnal-green


, on the ground floor. On the 24th of December, between one and two o'clock, I went out, locked my room door, and took the key. I returned between five and six o'clock, found the door burst open, and the prisoner in the room, close to a chair, in which were two sheets and a loaf of bread - they had been moved from where I had left them; I got the poker, and swore Iwould knock his brains out if he moved; he begged for mercy, saying he had a wife and two children.

PROSECUTOR. I made no offer to make it up.

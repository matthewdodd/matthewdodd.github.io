            . I had Elsbury's gown, and put it into a basket, inside the window - it stood about two yards from the door, and missed it next morning, when it was applied for.
JOSEPH COOPER. I am a constable. On the 4th of January, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Duck-lane, Westminster, coming out of No. 9, with something in his apron. I stopped him, and asked what it was; he said a gown, which he had got from one of the girls in that house - I took him back; he said to three-girls there,
"Charlotte, did not you give me this gown?" They all denied giving it to him - one was named Charlotte - she denied it; he said
"Then if I must tell you the truth, I found it last night as I came from Pimlico." It was quite wet.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

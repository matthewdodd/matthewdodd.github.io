            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 11th of March, I saw the prisoner and three others near one another - I knew them, and told Wood, who was with me, that something was wrong; I saw four pots standing at Mr. Ponsonby's rails - I watched some time, and saw the other three go away; I followed them some distance, and then ran round to find the prisoner - Wood gave me information; I took the prisoner, and found two pots in his hat and two on his person.

JOHN ANDREWS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of July, 44 pairs of shoes, value 8l. the goods of 



George Mayling.






BENJAMIN DENTON
. I keep the Swan-yard wagon-office, in Whitechapel. Mr. George Mayling's Brentwood wagon books at my yard, and carries parcels from there. On Saturday the 17th of July a parcel was booked there for John Dickson, Brentwood—I delivered it to Mr. Mayling's man—he put it on the wagon—the prisoner jumped on the shafts, and took it away—I knew him before—I had seen him about many times—it was a brown paper parcel, and contained a lot of ladies' shoes—the prisoner was not employed in our yard—we followed him up Castle-alley, but could not take him then, but we knew him so well that we took him afterwards—the parcel has never been seen.





JOSEPH JOHN DIXON
. I am a packer. I packed the parcel in question—it contained forty-four pairs of women's and children's shoes—it was to go to the White Swan Inn, Whitechapel—I booked the parcel at the yard, and left it in the counting-house—they were worth upwards of 7l.





THOMAS HENNEKIN
. I am assistant to the driver of the wagon, I put the paper parcel in the wagon, and while I went round for a few minutes, it was taken away.





WILLIAM VENENT
. I belong to the East London Water Company. I met the prisoner in Castle-alley—he was walking before I met him, and then he ran—there was another person with him, who was carrying a parcel.





SAMUEL TAYLOR
. I am street-keeper of Whitechapel. I received information of this from Mr. Denton, and went after the prisoner—I met with him on the following Tuesday—I brought him to the booking-office, and Mr. Denton said he was the person who took the parcel—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked if he was in Whitechapel on the Saturday—he said, "No;" and after that he said he was, between four and five o'clock, with another person.

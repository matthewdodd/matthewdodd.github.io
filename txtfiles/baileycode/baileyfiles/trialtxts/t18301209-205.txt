. On the 22nd of October four coppers were taken from inside my door - I left them there safe at six o'clock when I went out, and when I returned they were gone; I did not see the prisoner till he was in custody.

            . I took the prisoner on the 4th of November, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - the coppers have never been found.

            . On the 22nd of October I was coming up a yard, and saw the prisoner and two others standing at the corner of Mr. Levett's premises - I heard the prisoner say, "B-g-rd, if we don't have it;" and he went in and brought out the copper articles before him - the others lifted them on the prisoner's back, and he carried them off; I could not see how many there were of them-I knew the prisoner before; he did live with a butcher then - he sold fruit, and then he carried on a rum game.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the coppers - the officer said a woman and a boy came, and said they saw me take them.

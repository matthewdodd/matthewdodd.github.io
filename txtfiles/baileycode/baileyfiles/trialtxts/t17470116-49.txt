             , in the Parish of Margaret's Westminster


 , the 18th Day of November
.
The first Witness, 
               
                  John 
                  Hartley 
               



             the Prosecutor, he declares, that after his Goods were taken away, the first Discovery that was made, was by Isabella Notson , who, it seems, was beat and abused by her Accomplices, so she could not be easy till she had made the Discovery; so by her Direction they went and found them at the Bell in Whitechapel, sitting in a little dark Room with a Man with them; they were taken from thence before the Justice, there they confessed they had sold the Goods over the Water for two Guineas, and they lived together upon it as long as the Money lasted.
The above Evidence was confirmed by 
               
                  William 
                  Clubb 
               



             , who assisted in the taking of the Prisoners ; and this Witness adds , that they got a Search-Warrant, and went over the Water, and found only a Brass Fonder and a Candlestick at one Cooper's, a Pawnbroker.




               Guilty 39 s.

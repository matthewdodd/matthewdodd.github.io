            . On the 11th of May, I went to Whitechapel market, at about a quarter after nine in the evening. Coming along Brick-lane


, I was met by the prisoner and another man; they ran against me, and snatched my watch at the same instant; I immediately cried stop thief, and pursued them as fast as I could. I came up to the prisoner, and caught him by the skirts of his coat, and said, you have robbed me; he said, he had not got the watch. I took him to the watchhouse, where he was searched, but he had not the watch. I have never recovered it.

            . I took the prisoner into custody. I found two bad shillings and a bad sixpence on him
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a mob going across the road; they were running, and I ran too, and the gentleman caught hold of me, and said I robbed him, and I told him to search me, and there was no property found on me.

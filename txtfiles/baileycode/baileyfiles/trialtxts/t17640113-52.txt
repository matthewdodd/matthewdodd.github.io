            . I was servant to Count Haslang, but have since been turned away, about the losing this coat; on the 29th of December, I left my coat in the stable, it was a livery coat; I missed it on the morning early, I advertised it, and a guinea reward: Mr. Harris, in Monmouth-street, let me know he had got it; he sent for 
               
                  Jacob 
                  Abrahams 
               



            , of whom he bought it, and we went to the Coach and Horses in the Strand; there it appeared Abrahams bought it of the prisoner; the landlord described the prisoner, by which means we found him: when we took him up, he confessed before the constable and me, he stole the coat out of the stable a little after seven in the evening; (produced and deposed to, as the property of Count Haslang).

            . I bought this coat of the prisoner at the bar, at the Coach and Horses in the Strand, for a golden guinea, and spent two shillings in the house, on the 23d of December, between nine and ten in the morning; I sold it afterwards to Mr. Harris in Monmouth-street.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to the stable to ask for one Nicholson; the man that was there, said, this is not the stable, it is the next; going down, I saw the coat lying on the ground.

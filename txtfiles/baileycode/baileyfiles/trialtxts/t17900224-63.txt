                  THOMAS
                   POPPLEWELL
               



             sworn.
I carry on the business of a glass seller
. This servant
 had been with me eleven months, and a few days: I received some information that induced a suspicion against the prisoner, and directed he should be watched.

Mr. Garrow. You had a partner? - Yes; his name was 
               
                  Henry
                   Janson
               



            ; he is dead; I am the surviving partner; 
               
                  Priscilla
                   Harrison
               



            , who was the administratrix of Mr. Janson, has married Mr. 
               
                  Thomas
                   Harrison
               



            , and so they are in some degree in partnership with my business, and interested in the trade.


                  GEORGE
                   BROWN
               



             sworn.
I am a servant of Mr. Popplewell's; and was directed to watch the prisoner at the bar; I saw him take a bottle out of a prickle, and step to the door with it; and afterwards Mr. Janson came and told the prisoner he might go home for that time; which he did; and I went after him, and brought him back, and found a glass bottle concealed in his smock frock, as low down as his knees; he had a surtout coat, and under that a smock frock; there was a place, seemingly made on purpose to hold a bottle; he seemed very sorry, and asked Mr. Popplewell a thousand pardons; I have no doubt in the least to it's being Mr. Popplewell's property.


                  FRANCIS
                   JANSON
               



             sworn.
When I came home I directed this man to go; then Brown called him back again, and he took the bottle out of some part of his dress; he, himself, admitted, he took the bottle, but that it was to carry home some liquor to his wife.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I had this bottle to bring some small beer in, as the prosecutor did not like to see a pint of porter brought in, while we were washing the bottles.
Court to Janson. Was there any thing in the bottle? - No; it was a new bottle, and nothing in it; it had the bloom on.
The prisoner called one witness to his character.



               GUILTY
            .




               Transported for seven years
            .
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

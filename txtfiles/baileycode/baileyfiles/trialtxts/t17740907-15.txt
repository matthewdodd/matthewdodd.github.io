            . On the 31st of August, about twelve at noon, as I was going along Fleet-street


, to Mr. Child's, the banker, just by St. Dunstan's church, a lad told me I had lost my handkerchief; I turned round and saw the prisoner putting it in his breeches; the young man that told me had hold of him; I had the handkerchief in my hand not above a minute before; I can swear to the handkerchief; I had a piece of them.

            . I was coming down Fleet-street on the 31st of August; I saw the prisoner follow the prosecutor about ten yards; when he came up to St. Dunstan's church I saw him take the handkerchief out of his pocket; I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and told him his pocket had been picked; he turned round and laid hold of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence.
I drive a jack-ass; I sent a boy out with a bushel of plumbs; I was going to see after him; just as I came by St. Dunstan's church something came against my lap; I laid hold of it, and found it to be a handkerchief; this gentleman was twenty yards from me; I never was nigh the gentleman till he came and laid hold of me.

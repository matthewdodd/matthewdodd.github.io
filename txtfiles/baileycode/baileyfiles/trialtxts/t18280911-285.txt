            . I am a porter in the employ of Mr. Kensington Lewis, of St. James'-street, Piccadilly, inthe parish of St. James'


. On the night of the 31st of July, when I went to shut up the shop, this brass was on the railing, and in the morning I missed it; I saw it again at Marlborough-street; I fitted it to the place - it fitted-exactly.

            . I was on duty about half-past three o'clock in the morning in question - I saw the prisoner removing this brass - I went up to him, and he went away; I waited - he came again, and began again to take it up; I sprung my rattle, and he ran off, but we pursued and took him at the corner of Bury-street.

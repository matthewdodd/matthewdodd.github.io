            . I and the prisoner lodg'd at the Prince of Denmark's head, Wapping Old Stairs.
Q. What are you?
Youngman. I am a Sweed, we are seamen
; the prisoner had been constantly there every day, he eat and drank there, but did not lie there; he went away about seven or eight in the evening on the 6th of August; I went to bed about ten; the next morning I miss'd my hat.
Q. Who keeps that house?
Youngman. Mr. Ohran.
Q. Did you meet with your hat again?
Youngman. I suspected the prisoner, I went and found it in his bed-room (produc'd in court, and depos'd to)
Ohran. On the 7th in the morning the seamen miss'd several things, one had lost buckles, another a pair of breeches, and other things; we took up the prisoner, and he confess'd he stole the several things.

Q. Did he confess he stole the hat and guinea mention'd in the indictment?
Ohran. He did.
Prisoner's Defence.

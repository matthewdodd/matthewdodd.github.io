RICHARD BAILIFF
. I live in Queen-street, Hoxton, and am a hat manufacturer. The prisoner was in my employ about one year—on the 23rd of January, about two o'clock, I gave him eighteen sovereigns, eight half-sovereigns, and a£5 note, to take to the London and Westminster Bank, in Throgmorton-street—I saw no more of him till the 4th of March, when he was brought to me by an officer—the money has not been credited to my account at the Bank—he had the pass-book, and took it away—I saw no more of it.





CHARLES KENNEDY
. I am eleven years old. I was present when this money was given to the prisoner, it was 22l. in money and a£5 note—I noticed that he turned red in the face.





CHARLES JAMES REEVES
. I am clerk in the London and Westminster Bank, in Throgmorton-street. It is my duty to look over the accounts—I have looked to the prosecutor's account—there is no account of 27l. paid on the 23rd of January.





JAMES HANLEY
. I am an officer. On the 4th of March the prisoner was brought to me by a Liverpool officer—I asked him what had become of the book—he said he had made away with it.

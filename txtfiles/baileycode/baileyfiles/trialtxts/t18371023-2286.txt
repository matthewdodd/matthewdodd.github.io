ANN HEATH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of September, 2 sheets, value 2s. 6d.; 1 quilt, value 4s.; and 1 blanket, value 1s.; goods of 



William Bridgman; and that she had been before convicted of felony






MARY ANN BRIDGMAN
. I am the wife of William Bridgman, and let

ready furnished lodgings in Baldwin's-gardens. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 24th of September, and took the front room on the third floor at 3s. 3d. a week—she continued there one week and three days and paid one week's rent on the 30th—on the 4th I went into the room she occupied and missed the property—she said she had taken them—I found part of them at the pawnbroker's—I have lost a pillow, a bolster and one blanket entirely.





EDWARD CALVER
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a counterpane and sheet pawned by a female in the name of Burton—I do not know her.





SARAH TEER
. I deal in old clothes, and sell things. I bought a sheet and blanket of the prisoner—on the 27th and 28th of September—she told me her name was Burton.

Prisoner. She has now got a black shawl of mine, and I was to pay 1d. a week for it. Witness. No, I have not—I bought of her these things,





WILLIAM MARTIN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner and found two duplicates on her, which led me to the pawnbroker's.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not pledge them with the intent of stealing them, but to replace them—the person with whom they were placed is in the habit of lending money on articles and charging interest for it—I should have fetched them out on the Saturday, but was taken.





JOHN ROE
. I am an officer of the Mansion House. I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the same person.




GUILTY
. Aged 27—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

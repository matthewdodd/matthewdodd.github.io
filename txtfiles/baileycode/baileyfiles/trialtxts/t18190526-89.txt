            . I produce the register of marriages at the parish church of St. Mary le Strand, by which I find, that on the 19th of September 1799, 
               
                  John 
                  Caulton
               



             married 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bigland
               



            , widow - it is signed by the parties.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BIGLAND
               



            . I am the son of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bigland
               



            , who is now Mrs. Caulton; the signature to the register is my mother's writing. I know she lived with the prisoner as his wife. I believe the signature to be the prisoner's I served my time to him. I saw my mother eighteen months ago.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I believe it to be my mother's hand-writing.


                  SAMUEL 
                  FOSTER
               



            . I know the prisoner - the register is signed by him. I know Mrs. Caulton, who was Mrs. Bigland, I saw her on the 6th of March, 1818; I am certain it was that day, as I made a memorandum of it. I had some conversation with her respecting a debt which was due to me.
Cross-examined. I have not seen her since; she said she had not seen her husband for sometime, and did not wish to see him again.

            . I am curate of St. Pancras. I produce the register of marriages. I turn to the 3d of February, 1818, and find that 
               
                  John 
                  Caulton
               



             married 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Evans
               



            , by license. I performed the ceremony.


                  MARGARET 
                  EVANS
               



            . I know the prisoner. I was married to him on the 3d of February, 1818, at St. Pancras church. I signed this entry in the register, and saw him sign it - he left me on the 2d of March. I have seen his former wife since that. We were in furnished lodgings. My friends intended giving me some property, but they thought they would wait to see how he behaved to me.
Cross-examined. Q. How was he introduced to you - A. I first met him in the public street, where I was waiting for a female friend - it rained, and he held an umbrella over me. I would not allow him to see me home, but he would not leave me till I promised to meet him. I promised, in order to get rid of him, but did not meet him.
Q. When was your next interview - A. By chance, in the street - he spoke to me. Our courtship continued about six months. I made no inquiry about him. He obtained no money from me, he only took my watch when he left; I have since got it back from the pawnbroker's. He wanted me to mortgage a house which will come to me at my mother's death.

JOHN BRASINGTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of November, 1 saddle, value 30s., the goods of 



William Woodley.






WARD STAN WELL
. I am a policeman. On the 12th of November, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Highbury-park, carrying this saddle—I asked where he got it—he said he brought it from his master's, on Winchmore-hill—I took him into custody.





JOHN SAUNDERSON
. I am groom to William Woodley, of Green-lanes, Stoke Newington. On the morning of the 12th of November, the prisoner came to the yard with the corn-chandler, to assist him out with the mangle-wurzell—I

never saw him before—the saddle hung close by the stable—I did not miss it till next morning, when the policeman brought it—the prisoner did not belong to the corn-chandler.

Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday morning, I was standing at the corner of Stoke Newington, when the corn-chandler asked me to help him unload—I did so, and when I got to the bottom of the street, the saddle hung on the rails—I waited about a quarter of an hour, and having had nothing to eat I took it.
(William Hardy and John Morgan, of Stoke Newington, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Baron Alderson.

EDWARD FENNING

On the 29th of December, at half-past ten o'clock I saw the prisoner take a whole cheese out of the prosecutor's window was on the opposite side of the road—he gave it to one of two other boys and they all ran off together—I went in and told the shopman—he went in pursuit, and caught the prisoner—the other who had cheese got away—I am sure the prisoner is the boy that took it.

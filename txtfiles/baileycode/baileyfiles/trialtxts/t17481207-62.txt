                  Cooper 
               



            . I live at Limehouse


, I am a shipwright
, between the 16th or 17th of November, as I was going home, I was knock'd down three or four times by three or four fellows; when I got up Fitzgerald took me under a pretence of friendship into the house of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



            , and she push'd me into a little back room, my head ached to such a degree, that I wanted some rest, I was not fuddled, but with the blows I received I could hardly stand; I ordered some liquor; we had a pot of hot, I do not know I tasted it; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             ask'd for some money to get me some victuals, I gave her a shilling, she said, after some stay, she could get none; so I had some of her bread and butter and cheese; I pulled off my cloaths to get two or three hours rest; I gave another woman a shilling to clean my cloaths, for they were all over dirt; when I had been in bed about ten minutes, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



            , with a candle in her hand, and Fitzgerald came into the room, he pulled my breeches from under my head, I felt him taking them; I took hold of them, and we both pulled, but he put his hand in the pocket and took out four guineas in gold and between three and four shillings; when I complained, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             held out a guinea and said, damn your eyes, here is a guinea, but did not let me take it; they swore to such a degree, I was afraid of my life.
Q. Where is this house?
Cooper. It is in a place call'd Little Match Warfe, near Sun-tavern fields: I was resolved not to stay there, so between twelve and one I set out, Fitzgerald would go part of the way with me; we had gone but a little way, but he began to swear and damn, saying, he had no business to wait on me, so I set out a running and left him; I got a piece of chalk and return'd about two o'clock and chalked the house in divers places, to allow it again, and I held my ear to the window and heard the Prisoners swearing together in the fore-room, about shearing my money. I walked all night from one friend to another, to get them to go along with me to detect them: in the morning about seven o'clock, I got a friend to go with me; he lived at Shadwell, about half a mile from the house; I went to the watch-house, and desired their assistance; but I having no warrant, they would not go with me, saying it was a dangerous place: I called 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Campher 
               



             up, and he was afraid to go with me; at last we went, and they were about to leave the house; Mr. Campher endeavoured to persuade me to let them alone; the Prisoner, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             fell a crying, she was afraid he was a constable; he persuaded me to stay till breakfast; we went into a public house where the people was up hard by, and Fitzgerald staid at the door in his waistcoat; he swore he never saw me nor Mr. Campher before; we took him and carried him before Justice Berry, he did not commit him directly, being obliged to go to some court in White Chapel, so he committed him to the watchhouse.


                  Catherine 
                  Harrison 
               



            . Fitzgerald brought Mr Cooper into the house, and asked 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             if he could have a lodging there all night, this was about a month ago, Mr. Cooper was all over mud and dirt; and he said, he had been knock'd down three or four times, and he suspected Fitzgerald to be the person that knock'd him down, before he brought him in; Mr. Cooper gave a shilling for his bed, and went to bed by himself; I lived with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             at that time; he gave me a shilling for cleaning his coat.
Q. What time did he come into that house?
Harrison. Between 11 and 12 o'clock at night; Fitzgerald stay'd there all the time at our house, he went always by the name of Parsons; when Mr. Cooper and he came into our house, there was 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             and I and three young men sitting by the fire; Parsons said, Mr. Cooper had four guineas in his pocket, and desired he might be mill'd of them, but I did not know what milling meant; he was put into a little back-room, and paid a shilling for his bed, and a shilling for his supper, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             could get no meat, so brought him some bread, butter and cheese; Fitzgerald took the breeches from under Mr. Cooper's head, saying, his head lay very low: he went out of the room and opened his right hand, and said to me here you bitch! here is gold; I saw in his hand four guineas, three shillings and six-pence, and some half-pence.

                  Jennings 
               



            . I know Fitzgerald very well, he goes by many names : the 17th of Nov. there were three men and two women drinking a pot of Purl at my house; I cannot say Mary Brown was one of them, the other men paid for it; they went out of my house about a quarter of an hour after the Prisoner; Fitzgerald came in and called for a pennyworth of two-penny purl; it was made hot; he drank it, and he gave me a guinea to change, I gave him 20 shillings and a 11 pence out of it, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was going towards Ratliff-cross, and saw him in the watch house; I said, I had changed him a guinea just before; he shook his head at me, some of the people hearing that word, sent the account to Justice Berry, and his worship sent an officer to take this man up, and I went and declared the same.


                  Edmund 
                  Campher 
               



            . Mr. Cooper came to me at the sign of the ship at King James's-stairs, and desired I would go with him to the place where he had been robbed, saying, by so doing, he might stand a chance to get his money; I said, it was a very bad place, but I went with him; he carried me to the window, it was tied with a roap-yarn, I opened the shutter a little, and saw the Prisoners, Fitzgerald and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             and 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Harrisonby 
               



             the fire, in the fore room; Mr. Cooper said, that is the man that robb'd me. We stepped in, and I said he looks like a good sort of a man, he will give it you again, will you not, my friend? said I to Fitzgerald; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Brown 
               



             ran crying to me, fearing I had been a constable; but he had not one farthing returned him. We came away and went a second time, and then there was a padlock on the door; then we went to a house of very bad repute, where I expected we might find them; and the two first we saw were the two Prisoners at the bar, there we took them, and had them before Justice Berry. He would acknowledge nothing there.
Both 


               guilty 4 s. 10 d.

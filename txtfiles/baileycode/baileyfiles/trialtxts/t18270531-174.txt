                   from his person
            .
ROBERT JOLLIE. I live at Edinburgh. On the 23d of May, between four and five o'clock, I was in the Strand


; a gentleman came up, said I had lost my handkerchief, and pointed out the prisoners who were twenty or thirty yards from me, walking away - I seized one of them, and he the other - Sewell had got my handkerchief tied round his neck, though I had used it but a few minutes before.

            . I was in the Strand, and saw the prisoners walking together, following Mr. Jollie - Lovell took up his coat-tail, and pulled the handkerchief out a little way; he then pulled again, and got it out completely; he crossed over, and Hagan went under the gateway of Somerset-house; they crossed and joined again - I went and told Mr. Jollie; we went and took them at the corner of Holywell-street; we found the handkerchief round Lovell's neck; his own, which appeared to have been round his neck, was in his pocket; they were close together when he took it.

            . I belong to Hatton-garden Office- I took the prisoners with the handkerchief.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the gate-keepers of the King's tobacco warehouse


: I stopped the prisoner at the bar, he was a cooper
 employed in the warehouses; I rubbed him down, and found this tobacco between two stockings on his legs under a pair of trowsers; he wished me to let him go; I told him I could not; I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him.
Q. Was there such leaf-tobacco in the ware-house? - A. Yes.
Q. It belongs to the Commissioners of Customs? - A. Yes; Mr. Pearson, the keeper of the ware-house, is answerable.
Court. Q. What was the prisoner coopering? - A. Tobacco casks.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am warehouse-keeper
: I had the charge of this tobacco, I saw nothing of the transaction; we had a great quantity of leaf tobacco in the ware-house like this.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had ever borne an irreproachable character; he had a wife and four small children, with an aged mother, whose sole support depended on him, and therefore throwing himself upon the humanity of the Court.
The Prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.

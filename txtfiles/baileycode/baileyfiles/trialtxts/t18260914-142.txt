            . I saw the two prisoners about eleven o'clock, on Saturday, the 12th of August, turning out of Bond-street, into Hanover-square - a girl ran after them, and gave them some plums; I asked Fergusson what this bundle was which he had - he said washing, which he was going to take to his mother - I took him to the office.(Property produced and sworn to.)
FERGUSSON'S Defence. I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw this bundle; I picked it up - I found nobody to own it; I was coming down South Molton-street, and met the other prisoner.

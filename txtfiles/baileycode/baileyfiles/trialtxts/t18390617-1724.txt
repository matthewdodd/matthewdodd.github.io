In consequence of information I received, on the 6th of May, I went across the road, and collared the prisoner—I said, "You have two pair of boots"—he threw down one pair—I took him to my shop—he opened his coat and said, "For God's sake don't hurt me, here is the other pair."

Prisoner. I picked them up on the pavement, I did not steal them.

Witness. He said, "I took one pair, and another boy took the other pair, and gave them to me"—I found them on him about three minutes after I received the information—he was on the opposite side the way, opposite my window—the boots were hanging inside the door-way, on an iron rail—the string was cut.

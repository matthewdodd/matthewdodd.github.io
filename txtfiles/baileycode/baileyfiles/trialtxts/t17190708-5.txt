 on the 29th of May
 last. The Prisoners came into the Prosecutors Shop to cheapen Stockings, and the Prosecutor and his Wife being at the next House but one, their Daughter went to call 'em, and coming back saw William Perry take the Stockings and run away with them, whereupon she cry'd out stop him, and he being seen to run down a Cellar was immediately pursu'd and taken with the Stockings by him: Collier staid in the Shop, and to make 'em easy, told them he would come-again. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he hearing the cry of stop Thief ran down into the Cellar to see for him, and was apprehended himself. The Evidence not being sufficient to affect Collier, she was 

               Acquitted
            ; but being very full against Perry the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s.6 d.

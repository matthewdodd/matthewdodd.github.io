             , the 25th of May
 last.
The Prosecutors depos'd, They lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment; and it appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner work'd as a Journey-woman
 with the Prosecutor, and took an Opportunity to steal the Goods, and go away; which Goods were found at the Pawn-brokers, where they had been Pawned by the Prisoner. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

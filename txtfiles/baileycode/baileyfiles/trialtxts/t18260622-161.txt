            . I am a constable of St. Martin in the Fields. Mr. Howard is a shoemaker
, and lives in St. Martin's-court. On the 20th of June, about half-past nineo'clock at night, I saw the two prisoners walking backward and forward there, for a quarter of an hour; I then saw Cavenagh take these boots from a nail in the passage, and put them under a blue apron which he had; Warters stood by but did not go into the passage - they both ran up St. Martin's-court, together; I caught Cavenagh and he dropped the boots; I took him into the shop and called to Reardon, who took Warters.

            . I am foreman to Mr. John Howard. These boots are his - they have my writing at the bottom of them.
WARTER'S Defence. I was going to get some needles - a gentleman came and said I "have got the other."
CAVENAGH'S Defence. This man came and took hold of me; he went back 4 or 5 yards, and found a pair of boots.

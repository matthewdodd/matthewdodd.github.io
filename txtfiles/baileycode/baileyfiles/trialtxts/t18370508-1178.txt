LEWIS LEO
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
22nd of April, one pair of trowsers, value 7s., the goods of 



Samuel Ferrer Stephens, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL FERRER STEPHENS
. I live at the corner of Lawrence-lane, Cheapside, and am a hosier. On the 22nd of April, I was standing at

my shop-door, and was told the prisoner had taken a pair of trowsers—I missed a pair, he was taken, and they were found—these are mine.





WILLIAM ADAMS
. I was on duty in Lawrence-lane on the night of the 22nd of April—I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner was running towards me—I secured him in King-street, and he dropped these trowsers—I took them and him.





WILLIAM BARRY
, (police-constable H 59.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office, (read)—the prisoner is the same person.

Prisoner. I did it out of deep distress—I had no food to eat, and no lodging.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

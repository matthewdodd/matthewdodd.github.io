HENRY GAHAGAN, ESQ. I live in Lincoln's Inn-fields. On Sunday last, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, and perceived the prisoner in company with another; they followed me to Charles-street, St. James's-square; and, as I turned out of Charles-street


 to the Colonade, I felt a jerk at my pocket. They immediately passed, and got a few yards before me. I saw the prisoner concealing something in his breast, and secured him - he instantly threw the handkerchief down an area. His companion, who was younger, escaped.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of March, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoners in company together, watched, and saw them attempt a gentleman's pocket - I followed them into Lincoln's Inn-fields


, and saw Johnson lift Mr. Upton's pocket up, with one hand, and take the handkerchief out with the other - Christopher was close by. I immediately seized them both, and Johnson dropped it.

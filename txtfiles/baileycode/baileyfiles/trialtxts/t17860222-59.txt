What did you say to him? - He said, he had friends, and he would send to them in the morning; I never said any thing to him, the acknowledgement was made at my mistress's shop, where I work, in Cary-street, a tin-shop; he said he would be very willing to pay the money before he would go to trouble; and he said, he took it out of the side of the cannister, he was not promised nor threatened by any body in my presence, he was speaking of the four pounds nineteen shillings which I had lost.

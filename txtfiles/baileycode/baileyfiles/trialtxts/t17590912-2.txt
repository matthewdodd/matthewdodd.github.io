Eliz. Latham. I am servant to Mr

                  Neal 
               



            , in White-Lion-Court, Cornhill


. The prisoner came to our door to ask charity on the 18th of August last; I told her I had nothing to give her. She seemed to turn from the door, and I went down into the kitchen. I had been down but a very little time, before a young man came and told me, he believed a person had taken something out of the parlour. We both ran and took the prisoner in Cornhill, and took her back, and found the waistcoat in her apron.
Q. Where was it before?
Latham. It was hanging on a chair-back in the parlour.
Q. Was the parlour-door open or shut when she was at the door?
Latham. It was only shut. The prisoner said she took it out of necessity. The waistcoat produc'd in court and depos'd to.

            . I live servant with Mr Pindar, opposite Mr Neal's in White-Lion-Court; about six o'clock in the afternoon, on the 18th of 
               
                  August.
               


             I saw the prisoner come out of Mr Neal's door with something in her apron; I went and told the maid of it, and we followed her and took her, and found this waistcoat in her apron.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

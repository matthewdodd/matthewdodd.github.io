ELIZA MATENOT
 and 




MARY ANN JOHNSON
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
28th of Jan., 2 hams, value 15s., the goods of 



John Taylor; and that they had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN TAYLOR
. I am an oilman, and live in Jermyn-street. At half-past eight on Saturday night the prisoners came into my shop—Matenot asked for an ounce of pepper—she gave me a fourpenny-piece—I gave change—I suspected them—I watched, and saw a shuffling between their shawls the moment I served them—I came round the counter and missed two hams—I pursued them—they had turned up a passage, where I found them, and said, "You have got my hams; you had better give them up"—then one dropped, and then another dropped—a light was got in the house they ran into, and the two hams were found in the dark passage—I cannot say from which they fell.





THOMAS MARCHANT
 (police-constable C 49.) I was sent for, took the prisoners, and found the hams in the passage.

Matenot's Defence. I did not ask for the pepper; it was the other put down the fourpenny-piece.





EEWARD TANNER
 (police-constable E 56.) I produce a certificate of

Matenot's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—Matenot is the person that was tried.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) I produce a certificate of Johnson's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—she is the person who was tried.

MATENOT—

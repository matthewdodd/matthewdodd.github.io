JANE ARNOTT
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of August, 1 fork, value 10s.; and 2 spoons, value 4s.; the goods of 



Jacob Davis, her master.


JACOB'DAVIS. About the 15th of August I missed a fork and two spoons—I had seen them a month or fix weeks before—these now produced are them.

Prisoner. Miss Davis some weeks ago said. "I have been to get some orks out; I lent some silver ones a short time ago, and I am afraid they have returned a plated fork instead of a silver one;" since I have left the prosecutor, they say two forks were lost.





MORRIS LIONEL DAVIS
. I am the prosecutor's son. I know these two spoons are my father's—they have engravings on them.





ROSANNA HARRISS
. I live with Mr. Davis. Some time ago our cook inquired for a fork and spoon to make something for Miss Davis, which I gave her—she said she should want them for some days, and did not wish Miss Davis to know what she was going to make—I did not see them for some days after—when we had company to dinner I asked for them—she gave me a fork, and told me the spoon was so dirty I could not have it—that night she left—she gave me the fork, but on counting the plate I found one' missing—the plate is under my care—she gave me back a fork which I supposed to be the one I had given her, and an hour after she left.





HENRY WILSON
. I am assistant to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker. On the 16th of August the prisoner pawned this fork for 4s.





JOHN NORRIS
. I am servant to Mr. Sowerby. On the 13th of August I took a spoon in pawn—I have no recollection who of.

Prisoner's Defence. I used the old spoons, and when I wanted one I asked for it. I know nothing about it.




GUILTY
 of stealing the fork. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven

(There were five other indictments against the prisoner.)

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of September, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I was in Broad-street, St. Giles


, and saw the prisoners go to Mr. Thwaites shop - Simpson made several attempts to get these trousers, which hung inside the door - he got them at last by a strong pull, and gave them to Brown, who was looking in at the window - I had seen them together some time before. I ran over and seized Brown with the property; another person stopped Simpson.

            . I live in St. Giles; these trousers hung inside my door; they were pinned to a coat; it would require a strong pull to get them down.
SIMPSON's Defence. I saw a waistcoat piece in the window; I was looking at it; the other prisoner came and asked the time, I felt some one brush by me - I looked at the window again, and a man came up, and said, "I have got you;" he would not tell me what for.

LOUIS PANORMO
. I am a musical-instrument maker, and live in High-street, St. Giles. I lost this property from a stable which I rent in Falconbery-court—I had seen it safe in the morning of the 4th of April—I was sent for by Mr. Fox, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening—I found the padlock had been broken, and the stable was stripped—there were marks of an instrument by which it had been broken—this is my property.





WILLIAM FOX
. I am a barman. At a quarter before nine o'clock last Monday evening I was in Falconberry-court, and saw a man coming out of the stable with a whip—the prisoner then came out with a bag of harness—I called to him and asked what he had got—he made no answer—I then collared him, and took him to the Three Tuns, where I reside—I sent for the prosecutor, who claimed the property.





SAMUEL GODDARD
 (police-Sergeant F 13.) I took the prisoner and the property.

Prisoner's Defence. I was quite in distress—I really did not know what to do—I had been out of a situation for some time.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

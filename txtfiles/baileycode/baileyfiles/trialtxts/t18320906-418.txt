            . I am the wife of Samuel Wood. The prisoner hired a lodging at my house, on the 8th of August, at 3s. a week - he slept there that night, and never came again; we missed the sheets off the bed as soon as he left the house - there was no other person there.
Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know that your husband and he went out at the door together? A. He stood talking with us at the parlour-door for two or three minutes - the sheets have not been found.

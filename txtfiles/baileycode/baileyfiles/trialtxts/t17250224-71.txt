            , on the 22d of Jan
. last. It appeared that the Prosecutor kept a Shop
 in New Rag-Fair


. At the Back of her Shop, there was another, which was parted from her's, only by a Wooden Partition. This Back Shop stood empty; and the Prisoner now and then us'd to get in at the Window, and lie there; sometimes by himself and sometimes with a Woman. But the Prosecutor did not use to lodge in her Shop, except it happened to be a Rainy Night. On Saturday Night she heard a Noise in the Back-Shop; and looking out, saw the Prisoner getting out at his Shop-Window. She went home about 11 o'Clock, and left all safe; and on the Monday Morning following, she found Part of the Partition, betwixt her Shop and the other, broken down, and a great many of her Goods gone, to the Value of above 5 l. some of which she found in the Back-Shop, where the Prisoner us'd to lie. She met him afterwards, and secured him. The Prisoner, in his Defence, brought a Witness to swear, that he was not out of his own Lodging in Brown's Lane in Shoreditch, from Saturday in the Evening, till Monday Morning. But the Evidence against him being very positive, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

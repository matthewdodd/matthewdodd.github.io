             - he lives in St. John-street


, and is a stove-grate manufacturer
 - the prisoner lived with me for three weeks. On the 16th of January I missed my shoes, from the floor at the foot of the bedstead - I had put them there when I went to bed; I thought the prisoner was gone, as I had discharged her on the Saturday, between two and three o'clock, and put my shoes at the foot of the bed at twelve, when I went to bed; she must have got in and concealed herself in one of the rooms.

            . I am the prosecutrix's husband. I took the prisoner in Cross-street on the Sunday evening; I asked her to show me her shoes - she put them up, and I knew them to be my wife's; I gave 4s. 6d, for them about a week before.(Property produced and sworn to.)

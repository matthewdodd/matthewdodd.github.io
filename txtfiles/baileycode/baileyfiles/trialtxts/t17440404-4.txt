            . Last Wednesday. When I came home about eight or nine in the evening, my sister asked me, where my new cloth was: I told her, it was in my box. She said it was not. I suspected the Prisoner, and next morning went after her, and met with her by St. John's Gate. I asked her where my things were. She said they were pawned at the Blue Ball in Old street. I got a search warrant, and asked, if there was any new cloth pawned in the name of 
               
                  Sarah 
                  English 
               



            . The pawnbroker's wife said , they had no new cloth. We searched, and I found my new cloth wrapped up in one of my aprons, pawned in the name of 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Cook

                  Capon 
               



            . I went out that day to washing, and left the Prisoner to take care of my child; and when I came home, I missed the new cloth first; and searching farther, missed the other things. The Prisoner said she had pawned them, and that she took them with a view of getting a spinning-wheel.

            . The Prisoner came to me with these things, and a young child in her arms ; she said she brought them to get money to pay her rent, and that her name was

             - she pledged them for seven shillings.

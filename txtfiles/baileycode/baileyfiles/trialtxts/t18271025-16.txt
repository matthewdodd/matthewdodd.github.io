             was indicted for

JOHN ORCHARD. I am a draper
, and live in Regent-street. On the 3d of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was on Holborn-hill


, coming towards the City; my coat was buttoned up; I felt my silk handkerchief drawn from my outside pocket; I turned round, and caught the prisoner by the collar - I found my handkerchief in his hand; there appeared to be another person in his company, who passed on, and took no notice, but they were close together. I think the prisoner could not have taken it without the other seeing it. When I took it from the prisoner's hand he begged me to let him go - that was all he said; I said I should give him in charge; he then rescued himself from me - I pursued, and never lost sight of him till I secured him.

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house with this handkerchief; I found 1s. 11/2d. on him, also a copper wire, with a hook at the end of it, and a sharp crooked pointed knife, a clasp knife, with a turn at the end of it, like a gardener's knife.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I stopped the prisoner, and helped to take him to the watch-house, as I had seen him escape from Orchard.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of Brook-street - a person stopped me at the corner.

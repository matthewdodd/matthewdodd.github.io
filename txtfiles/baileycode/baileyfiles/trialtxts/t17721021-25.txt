            . I live in Cox's-square, Spittalfields


. I let a ready furnished room to

                   Ratey
               



            ; in August last two of my shirts were produced before Justice Sherwood by Ann Hill.

            . These shirts ( producing them) were pawned with me on the 3 d of September by the prisoner; they said they belonged to one 
               
                  Ann
                   Kelly
               



            ; I lent her 6 s. 7 d. on them; she came again and had to the amount of 9 s. on them. (The sheets deposed to by Legoe's wife.)

                   Ratey
               



            . I lived in a lower room at Mr. Legoe's house; the prisoner came to me four days after I had been there, and asked me if I would go out to a day's work; I was glad to have a day's work; I went with her; she dropt me as we went; when I got to the place to which she had directed me, there was no work wanted to be done; I returned home in about three-quarters of an hour; I found the window open, which I tied with a string; the door was locked as I left it. I missed a shirt, a towel, and the sheets from the bed. About ten days afterwards, I met the prisoner in Whitechappel; I charged her with stealing the things; she denied it; I carried her before the Justice; there she confessed she had stole the things, and had pawned them to Ann Hill, who produced them.

Prisoner's Defence.
I pawned these things to be sure for another woman.

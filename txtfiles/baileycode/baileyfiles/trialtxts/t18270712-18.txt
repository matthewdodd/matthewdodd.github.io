                  DOWDELL
               



            . I am a grocer, and live at Islington - I deal with Mr. Tucker. On the 25th of May I paid the prisoner on his account 7l. 16s.; I am sure I gave him seven sovereigns, but whether the rest was all in silver I cannot say - he wrote this receipt in my presence (read); this is the only transaction I had with him.

MR. TUCKER
               



            . On the 25th of May the prisoner did not pay me 7l. odd on Mr. Dowdell's account, nor has he at any time. Here is the book in his hand-writing; there is no such entry.
Cross-examined. Q. Here is 7l. 16s. in this page? A. No - that is 7s. 10d.; I have furnished him with a copy of this book since he has been in custody; I gave him a whole week to rectify his book if it was incorrect, and to account for any thing he might be deficient in; Mr. Dowdell's name is not in this book at all; he should account to me every night for the money he receives that day; he had a guinea and a half a week.
Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Tucker took the book from me, and being deprived of that I could not make up my accounts.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 46.

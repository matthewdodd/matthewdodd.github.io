            . On the 27th of March, at half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was on Blackfriars-bridge


; I felt a snatch at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I turned and saw the prisoner with it in his breast; I asked him to give it to me - he said he had not got it, and he asked what business I had to stop him; I kept hold of him, and at the foot of the bridge he threw it down and said he had found it - I still followed him; he then ran - I saw an officer, and gave charge of him.

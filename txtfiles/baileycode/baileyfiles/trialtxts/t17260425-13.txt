             thus depos'd. Between four and five in the Afternoon, I lock'd my Chamber Door, and went down Stairs to sit with my Landlady. The Prisoner (who was an Apprentice
 to my Landlord Johnson) came in about 6 o'Clock, took his Master's Key, and went up Stairs: He staid about a Quarter of an Hour and then came down again, stood a little while at the Door, and went out. I Mistrusted Nothing all this Time, and when I went up Stairs, I found my Door lock'd; but I no sooner open'd it, than I saw my Drawers open. I examin'd farther, and found that my Money bag was empty'd, and my Rings and my Silver Spoons were gone. I call'd to my Landlady in a Fright, and told her I was robb'd, and she going into her Room, found that she was robb'd too.

             thus depos'd, I am a Beadle, I was along with some Constables. At the Feathers Tavern in Drury-lane, we heard a Man and some Women of the Town in the next Room, and thereupon we went in, and found the Prisoner with a Couple of Whores. He was very much in Drink, and we found a great deal of Money, Spoons and Snuff-boxes about him. We carry'd him out to the Bear-Inn, and desired the Keeper of the Tap-house, to take care of him till he was sober, and not let the Whores come near him, for fear they should plunder him; but he would not take any Charge of him, till we had taken an Account of what Money, and other Things the Prisoner had about him, which we did, and left him there.
The Keeper of the Tap thus deposed. The Morning after the Prisoner was left to my Care, he pretended that he was come away from his Father, without his Consent, and said, that he would stay still the Evening, and then go and lye at the Bell-Savage-Inn on Ludgate-hill, that he might be ready to go out with the Coach in the Morning, for he intended to go to a Relation of his in the Country; but in the mean Time, his Master the Prosecutor found him out, and I delivered to him the two Broad-pieces, the Gold Rings, and other Things that I had in Charge.

             thus depos'd. I am a Taylor
 by Trade; the Prisoner came from Monmouth, and he was put as an Apprentice to me upon Charity; he behaved himself well, and never lay out of my House till the Night I lost my Goods out of my Bureau; I heard that he had been seen in Drury-Lane, and so I walk'd up and down there several times; at last I saw him in the Window at the Bear-Inn. I went in, seiz'd him, found my silver Salt in his Pocket, and he confess'd to me, that my Watch and Snuff-box were gone to be mended in Fleet Street; besides what I had back from the Man of the Inn. The Jury found him 


               guilty of each Indictment to the Value of 39 s.

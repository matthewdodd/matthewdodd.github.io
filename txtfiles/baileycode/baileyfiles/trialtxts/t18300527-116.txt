            . On the 22nd of May, about one o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me as I was on duty under the Piazzas, Covent-garden - he said, "Do you want an Old Bailey case?" I said, "If it is a good one, let's have it;" he then said, "Take this, it will bring you into one;" giving me these papers - I said, "Where did you get these?" he said, "From Kensington, I broke a place open, and took them;" I said, "Have you any more?" he said Yes, and took the rest out of his pocket.

JOHN DANIEL JEFFCOAT
. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Ade and his partners, linen-drapers, in Oxford-street. On the evening of the 26th of November, the prisoner E. H. Tuff came to the shop and asked for a quarter of a yard of print—I served her, and she paid me 2d. for it—one of my employers took her down to the end of the shop and gave her a few pieces for patch-work, which were found on her—as she was leaving I observed she had something in her pinafore—I followed her—she turned round Charles-street, and was there joining the other prisoner, whom I had first seen two or three yards from our shop, where she could command a view of our shop—they joined, and walked together to Charles-street, and there E. H. Tuff took from her pinafore a worsted shawl, which she folded, and put round the other prisoner's shoulders, and the other pulled it to—I took them back to the shop—they both attempted to escape—this is the shawl—it is ours—it is worth 11s.—it has our private mark on it, and was taken from the middle of the shop.





THOMAS BURNS
 (police-constable F 140.) I was called in, and took the prisoners—I found on Charlotte Harriet Tuff a pot of anchovy paste, a piece of Saxony cloth, and a locket, which we have found no owner for.

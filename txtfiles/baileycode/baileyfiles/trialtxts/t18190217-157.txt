            . I am a watchman of Lincoln's Inn-fields


. On the 6th of February, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. William Bignal's court-yard, and get over the area. Knowing the house was empty, I went up, and saw him cutting the lead, secured him with it, and took him to the watch-house. He was down the area full an hour. I found a knife on him. The lead was separated.

            . I live at the corner of Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell, and am a silver spoon maker
: the prisoner was my clerk
. On the 13th of November, 
               
                  Elias 
                  Levi 
               



             came and gave me an order for some spoons: when he went away, the prisoner went out upon business: Levi soon returned, and ask'd me, whether my clerk traded for himself? and said, he had wanted him to buy some spoons of him; I told him to comply with it, and send for me at the time, which he did: I went to Levi's Master's, and there staid till Levi came for me, in Adams's court, Duke's Place: I went with him, about half after 8 in the evening to the Blue Boar hard by, where was the prisoner and these spoons, (producing 78 tea-spoons) my property; they have my mark upon them: I said, what, do you sell my spoons? he said, he was a little distressed; he had been in company on my Lord Mayor's day, and had pawned his watch, and this was in order to get it out again, and said, he hoped I would not charge the constable with him, it was the first time he had done so: when the Jew told me this, I went up into the prisoner's room, and in his waistcoat pocket I found three dozen and a half of these very spoons; I left them in his pocket, and when I went out in the evening, in order to meet him at the Jew's, for a blind, I told him I was going to the play.

                  Levi 
               



            . I had been to the prosecutor's to bespeak goods; the prisoner followed me, and said he had some spoons of his own, and wanted me to buy them. I ordered him to come about 8 at night with them, and when he left me, I went back and told his master of it, and he came by appointment to Mr. Myer's, my master, and when the prisoner and I had bargained, I went over to my Master's, pretending to fetch the money, and brought the prosecutor to him; he sold them to me as his own property.

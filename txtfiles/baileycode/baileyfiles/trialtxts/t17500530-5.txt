            . The Prisoner was my servant
. On Thursday night, the 17th, I had some money to pay away the next day, I told nineteen guineas and one shilling into a purse, I put the purse into my pocket, and put it on the bed, I was intending to go to bed; between eight and nine o'clock I was call'd down, afterwards I thought where I had left my pocket with my money in it.
Q. How long had you been gone from it?
Bradnam. About half an hour. I went into my room and found my pocket had been mov'd, I took it and told over my money, and missed a guinea. I went into my room and ask'd my maid who had been there, she said she did not know. I said some body had, for I had lost a guinea. I insisted on searching her, which I did, and found the guinea upon her.
Q. How did you do to know it again, had it any mark upon it?
Bradnam. No, my lord, it had not; but she then owned, that she had taken it out of my pocket, saying, she design'd to pay it me again. I call'd 
               
                  Ann 
                  Wade 
               



            , and John Archer up as soon as I had found it, who heard her own the taking it. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Wade 
               



            , and 
               
                  John 
                  Archer 
               



            , confirm'd her testimony of that. The Prisoner acknowleged the fact.



               Guilty
            .

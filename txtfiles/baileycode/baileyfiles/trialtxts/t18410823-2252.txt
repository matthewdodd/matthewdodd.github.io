WILLIAM DE LACY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of July, 1 plane, value 4s.; 1 saw, value 3s.,; 1 square, value 2s. 6d.; and 1 bevil, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



Robert Cox; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ROBERT COX
. I am a carpenter, and work for Mr. Archbutt, of Sloane-street —his shop is in Pelham-place, Brompton. I and some of my fellow workmen left some tools there on the 22nd of July—I locked the door and bolted the windows, and left at seven o'clock in the evening—the next morning, at half-past six, I found some person had got in—I missed the tools stated in the indictment—these produced are them—four of the other men lost tools also.





JOSEPH BAKER
. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 23rd of July I fell in with the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from the work-shop, at a quarter-past four o'clock—he was carrying a basket full of tools—he asked me which was the way to Piccadilly, and said he was going to work—he had an apron tied round him like a carpenter, and had a Petersham coat on—I took him, and found these tools.





WILLIAM WALLIS
 (police-constable E 64.) I produce a certificate of

the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office— (read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Ten Years.

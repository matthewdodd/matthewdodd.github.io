             sworn. - I lodge at No. 12, Lad-lane: On Thursday last, about half past twelve, as I was crossing the top of Wood-street, in Cheapside


, I felt a sudden jerk at my right hand pocket, I instantly turned round, and saw the prisoner at the bar with this handkerchief in his right hand, (producing it); I caught him immediately by the collar with my right hand, and with my left took the handkerchief out of his right hand; in a very short time, a considerable crowd gathered round, and I called a hackney coach to put him into, and he refused to go into it; I was then advised to carry him to Guildhall, which I did; and he was committed. I never quitted him.
Q. Are you positive this is your handkerchief? - A. Yes; it is marked.
Prisoner's defence. I was going to the East-India-house, to get a ship, I saw this handkerchief lying upon the ground, I picked it up, and this gentleman said, it belonged to him.

             to my house, with some gold and silver pendants, and enamelled dial-plates, as suspecting he had stole them. I asked the lad how he came by them; he owned he had them of his younger brother, who was our errand boy
, and who was then gone of an errand. When he came home, we examined them separately, and William confessed he got at them by taking off the hinges from the shutters to a mahogany drawer where we keep them, in which drawer we keep enamelled dial-plates. We always found it locked.

             also confessed to the receiving them of his brother. He gave us the key of his box at Sir

                  Fielding 
               



            's: we went with some of Sir John's people, and in his box we found a watch, watch dial-plates, and several other things not in the indictment.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at the corner of Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell. On the 7th of November,

                  Trimble 
               



             came to my shop with a gold pendant, and wanted 4 s. 6 d. on it. I suspecting he stole it, desired him to leave it, and call again, saying my wife was out, and that I had no change. When he came again I stopped him, and insisted on his telling me where he got it; he said he had it of one Jones, a pendant-maker, at the upper end of Wood's Close. He said he was a maker in the wholesale way, and sometimes he could not complete an order on a Saturday night, and then he sent a pendant to make a little money till his order was compleat. I was determined to go and know whether there was such a person, but at last he confessed he had a brother at Mr. Upjohn's, and that he had them of him. I had taken some of him before, which made me suspect, him. I had taken four gold and two silver pendants, and fifty-four watch dial plates of him at different times, between the 2d of October and the 7th of November, which he pledged in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Trimble 
               



            . At his first coming, he told me he was a dial-plate-maker, and had given two guineas to learn enamelling, and that he formerly had been a shoemaker, and that he brought them for one

             the headborough deposed, he was ordered to search the prisoner John, and found a parcel of watch balances, four watch glasses and one dial plate in his breeches, and that in searching his box at his lodgings in Aylesbury-street, he found several articles in the watch way, and that he heard the prisoners both confess, one to the stealing, and the other receiving the things of him.
The prisoners in their defence said, they were together in St. John's Lane; and there found the things all together in a brown paper.

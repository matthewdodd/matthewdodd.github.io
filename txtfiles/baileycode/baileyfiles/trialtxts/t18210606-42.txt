            . I have the care of a Sunday-school
, in Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields


. The prisoner was a scholar some time back, for nearly seven years, but had left it. I was in the school on Sunday the 20th of May; when I went in, I laid my watch on the desk, as usual; I went into the female department of the school, and on returning, missed it - I had seen the prisoner in the school before I went to the female department, when I returned he was gone; he was brought back in half an hour by some of the teachers, and as he came up the stairs I saw him lay the watch on the stairs, it was worth thirty or forty shillings - I am sure it is mine; he had once been in my shop some time back, but did not suit me; I have a good opinion of his mother.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I beg for mercy.

            . The prisoner was a porter
 to our house; I am in partnership with Mr. Jones; we had long suspected the prisoner; I sent for Mr. Holmes the constable, and we searched the prisoner's box; there we found a piece of russia diaper containing 17 ells and a half, that was the property of my partner and me. I also saw these callico shirts taken out of his box, and two thread stockings, which belonged to Mr.

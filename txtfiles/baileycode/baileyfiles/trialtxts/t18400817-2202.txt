WILLIAM CHARRINGTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of July, 18 pairs of stays, value 2l., the goods of 



Robert Gay.






MARY HANCOCK
. I am the niece of Robert Gay, who lives in Free School-street, Southwark. These stays are his—I saw them safe at five o'clock in the morning on the 31st of July, and they were missed at nine o'clock, from the table in the shop—(examining them)—these are them.





JOHN JOHNSON
. I am an officer of the Town Hall. On the 31st of July, I was in Church-street, Southwark, near Mr. Gay's house—I saw two persons running with a bundle—it was dropped—I ran and took the prisoner, and had a scuffle with him—the other escaped—I am sure the prisoner was one who was running, and either he or the other dropped the bundle—this is it.





JOHN SLADE
. I was with Johnson—I saw the prisoner run—he dropped the bundle—the officer said, "Aid and assist"—I took it up—the officer had a fight with the prisoner.





ROBERT GAY
. I lost eighteen pairs of stays on the 31st of July—these are them.

Prisoner's Defence. I never dropped them—I heard of a place of work, and was going to it—another man passed me, dropped them and ran away.




GUILTY.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

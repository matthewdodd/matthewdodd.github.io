            . I am a goldsmith
, and live in Red-Lion-street, Clerkenwell. On the 25th of April, about one o'clock I was crossing from Sadler's Wells into St. John-street-road


, a man called to me that my pocket had been picked; I found my handkerchief on the ground, and the prisoner close by me. I stopped him as he was pointed out to me; he said he knew nothing about it - nobody else was near me.

I saw the prisoner walking behind the prosecutor in the road - I saw him put his hand into Mr. Dugard's pocket, and pull the handkerchief out. I called out to the prosecutor - he immediately dropped it. The prosecutor stopped him.

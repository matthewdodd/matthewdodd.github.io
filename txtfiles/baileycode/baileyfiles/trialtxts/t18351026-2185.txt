WILLIAM WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of October, 1 sovereign, the monies of 



Henry Robert Storey, from the person of 



Henry Robert Storey, the younger; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.







HENRY ROBERT STOREY
. I am a coal-dealer. My son is not more than eight years old—he was sent with some goods to Mr. Warren's in the Strand—the prisoner was in my service at the time—my son went with him—he took down 11s. with the bill, and was to bring back a sovereign—the sovereign was given to my son—I never saw the prisoner again till the Thursday following—he had been in my employ for four months—he gave me no notice of leaving.





HENRY ROBERT STOREY, JUN
. I go to church—persons who tell lies go to hell—I went with the prisoner on the errand to the blacking manufactory—I took down 11s.—we delivered the goods and I received the sovereign, and the prisoner dragged me down Hungerford Hay-market, he then rubbed my hand, and took it out of my hand, and ran away with it.





THOMAS EVANS
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—I know he is the person that was tried—I am his brother.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

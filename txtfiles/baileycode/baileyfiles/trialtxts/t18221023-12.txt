                  , from his person

WILLIAM LOW. I am a bookseller
, and lodge in Bull and Mouth-street. On Saturday, the 12th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Cateaton-street


, going to my lodging, and felt something push against me; I turned round, and missed my silk handkerchief, which I had used five minutes before. On my turning round, the prisoner walked out from behind me; there were several others near me; I followed and stopped him in King-street - he had crossed over. My suspicion was increased by his walking fast. I took him, and found my handkerchief in his pocket; he had another blue one, which he said was his own, and that he found mine. Smith took him in custody.


                  WILLIAM 
                  SMITH
               



            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner. I found a blue handkerchief marked C. G. on him, which he claimed.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. In Cateaton-street I saw two lads walking behind Mr. Low; I happened to turn my head and saw them cross into the road; I saw the handkerchief dropped, picked it up, and put it in my pocket; I did not know whom it belonged to.

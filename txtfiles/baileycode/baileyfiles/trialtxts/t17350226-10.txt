            , Junior. The Prisoners came into our Shop, in Chandois Street, Covent Garden


, and looked upon some striped Thread Sattins and at last bought 14 Yards. I heard a Piece fall, and one of them took it up and laid it on the Counter. I observed that they were shuffling something under their Riding-hoods, and I told Mr. Young, that I suspected they had stole a Piece, upon which he presently follow'd them, and found this Piece of Sattin upon Ward - This was about noon.
Hezekiah Young. I overtook Fream first, and turned up her Cloak, but finding nothing there, I stopt Ward, and found the Sattin upon her. They were both carried to Covent-Garden Round-house: and the same Day examined before Justice Hilder, who granted a Warrant for commiting them to the Gatehouse, but in their way thither, with two Constables with them in a Coach and the Beadle behind, they were rescued, by several Men. We afterwards found the Prisoners committed to the Gate-house for a Fact of the same kind.

The Jury found Ward 

               Guilty
             and 

               acquitted

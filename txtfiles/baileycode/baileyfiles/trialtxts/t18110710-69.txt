            . I carry on the business for William Wilson, I live in Limehouse. On last Monday evening, about seven o'clock, I left the house, there was a sail cloth left on the floor, on Tuesday morning. When I came to work again, there was part of it cut and taken away out of the sail room.
MR. RICHARDSON. I am foreman to Messrs. Tilt and Dent, colour manufacturers. On last Monday a little after twelve at night, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Wilson's warehouse with the canvas under his arm; I went to meet him, he jumped down into the yard off the wall with the canvas I and the watchman followed him, and took him. This is the canvas.

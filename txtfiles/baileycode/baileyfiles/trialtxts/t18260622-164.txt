            . I am an officer. On the 26th of May I saw the two prisoners going up Golden-lane; Tunbridge had a stove on his back - they went into an iron shop, and then same out; I took them to the watch-house, and asked where they got it; Tunbridge said "Kidman went into an empty house, and tied a string to it, and got it out" - I asked the man in the shop what they came for- he said they brought a stove to sell for 6d., and he sent them to fetch their father.

            . I am servant to Charles Hayne - he is a timber merchant, and lives in Long-lane, Smithfield. I left this stove on his premises on Thursday, the 25th of May, and on Saturday, the 27th, I went to work, and missed it. Kidman lives in the neighbourhood.
TUNBRIDGE'S Defence. This boy asked me where he could sell a stove - he said his mother paid 1s. 6d. on it, and he was to go and pay 6d., which he had done.

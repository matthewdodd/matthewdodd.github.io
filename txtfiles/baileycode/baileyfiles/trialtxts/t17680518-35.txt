            . I happened to be in the yard where the child's mother lives; the child came crying, and said, she had been robbed of her bundle in Dover-street, Piccadilly


; she said it was done by a youngish girl with a red cloak and a black hat; I pursued up Albemarle-street, and overtook the prisoner; she was putting her cloak over the bundle; I took her and the bundle back to Dover-yard; the child said, that is the woman; the prisoner owned she was guilty of taking the bundle from the child, and begged for mercy; the child is here, she is but eight years old.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going along, and picked up this bundle.

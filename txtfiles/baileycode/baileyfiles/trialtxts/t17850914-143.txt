             sworn.
I saw the prisoner take one or two shoes, I could not tell which; I told the prosecutor, and we pursued and took him, he delivered up the shoes; he behaved exceedingly civil, and did not hesitate in the least.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I met a person who owed me a trisle, and he gave me these shoes for 4 s. 6 d. and I put them into my pocket.
The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.

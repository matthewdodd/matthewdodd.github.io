            . I am errand boy to Mr. Edward Couchman. On the 28th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come out of the premises with a ream of paper under his arm - he got out of the gate; I ran up stairs and asked master if he had sent him out with paper; master ran out and caught him.
EDWARD COUCHMAN. I am a printer, and live in Throgmorton-street. The prisoner was my servant; Oliver gave me information - I pursued, and came up with the prisoner about one hundred and fifty yards off, with a ream of foolscap on his shoulder; I said,
"I have caught you at last" - he made no reply; he was rather intoxicated, but talked quite sensible.
Prisoner. I should not have done it if I had been sober.

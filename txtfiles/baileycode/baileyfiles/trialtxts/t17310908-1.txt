It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prosecutor's Wife stepping out of her Shop, turning her Head, saw the Prisoner leaning over the Counter, and found her Money-Drawer open, and the Money gone; that the Prisoner ran away, but being pursu'd, he was taken, and the Money found upon him. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him

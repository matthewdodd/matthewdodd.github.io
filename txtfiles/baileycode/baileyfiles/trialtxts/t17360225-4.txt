T. A. I keep a Linnen-Draper's Shop
: On the 20th of January I was in a back Room behind my Shop, and saw the Prisoner come in; he went behind the Compter, and took this piece of Checque; I took hold of him before he got out of my Shop; he flung the Goods down and got from me, but I followed him, and cry'd, Stop Thief: He was taken and brought back in five Minutes Time. His Friends have sent to me since the Fact was committed; informing me, they should be very glad to have him sent abroad, and that they dread his coming home again.

. On the 14th of August I went out; when I returned I missed my glass. I ran out, and was directed towards the City-road, and overtook the prisoner with it, opposite Bunhill-fields - I knew him before. I asked him what he was going to do with my glass? he said nothing, but put it into my arms. I informed Goodluck, who took him. He was very intimate with my husband.

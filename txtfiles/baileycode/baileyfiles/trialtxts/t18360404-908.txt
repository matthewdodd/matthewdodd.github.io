CALEB ROBINSON
. I reside in Holborn and am a tailor and draper. The prisoner was in my service from either to nine moths—he slept in our house—I occasionally gave him a few halfpence—I took him out of charity and kindness to his father who was in very distressed circumstances—he entreated me to take him, if I gave him only victuals—Mr. Boyce, a pawnbroker, lives near me—in consequence of what he said to me, I called in a policeman—the prisoner was in the shop—he searched him, and on his person were found these two duplicate—I asked him what made him do so to me, who had been his friend—he made no reply—these are my trousers and coats—they are new—I searched all the prisoner's old clothes, and in the fob pocket of a pair of old trousers, I found the duplicates of some other articles of mine.





HENRY NEWCOMB
. I am shopman to Mr. Boyce, of Holborn. I produce one pair of trousers which I took in, I believe of the prisoner—this duplicate corresponds with what I have got.





HENRY RADDELL
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Dry, a pawnbroker, who lives in St. Martin's lane—this coat was pledged but the person who took it in has left our service—his duplicate corresponds with the on that we have.

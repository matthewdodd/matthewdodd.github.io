WILLIAM HENRY SHIPWRIGHT
. I live with my father, in Great Barlow-street. On the 29th or 30th of August, I met a person in Portman-street, Oxford-street, he asked me where I was going—I said nowhere particular—we walked on down Holborn to Shepherd-street—he the asked me if I would fetch a box from his master's house, which he was going to take to Camden-town in a gig—he said "Come this way," and led me on to Argyle-place, and then he pointed to a white half-fronted house, and said it was next door to that house—I went there, and asked for the box—a lady came to the door, and there was no box there—I returned to where I left him, and he was gone—I had left my jacket with him, as he said I had better pull off my jacket of the stuff in the ox would run out upon it—the prisoner is the person—I am speaking of—I am quite sure of him—here is the jacked—it is mine.

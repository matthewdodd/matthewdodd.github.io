WILLIAM BOWDEN

JOHN FIGGINS STEPHENS
. I live at No. 155, Fleet-street. On the 9th July I was at the corner of Farringdon-street and Fleet-street—I had a handkerchief in my pocket when I left home—I received information, and my handkerchief was gone—this is it—(looking at it.)





CHARLES THORP
. I am patrol of Farringdon-street. At half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 9th of July, I was in Fleet-stmt, and saw the prisoners—I knew them by sight—they were together, and appeared to know one another—I saw Jones put his hand into the prosanrtor's pocket, take out the handkerchief, and was giving it to Bowden—I told the prosecutor, and collared both the prisoners—they struggled, Jones got away, and threw the handketchief at my feet—I found a small pan of scissors on Bowden, and this other handkerchief.

Jone's Defence. I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I was above a hundred yards from this person—he never knew me in trouble before—I am a stranger in London—there is no witness saw me throw the handkerchief away, and there is no mark on it.

Bowden's Defence. I had not been in town above four hours, and was walking down the street—the officer seized me, and said, "I have got you"—I said, "What do you want of me?"—the scissors are my own—I am a tailor—I never saw Jones in my life.

JONES†—

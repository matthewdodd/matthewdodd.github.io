            . I am a millwright
. I lost an adze out of my shop the 11th of this month. The prisoner came to my shop and asked me for work. I told him I had none. I went out, and left him in my shop.



                  William 
                  Edwards 
               



            . I am journeyman
 to Mr. Dagnal. I lost an axe and hand-saw at the same time, out of my master's shop.


                  Philip 
                  King 
               



            . I work with Mr. Dagnal. After the things were missing I followed the prisoner to Brentford, and at Mr. Still's, a millwright there, I found the prisoner. I took him with the things, mentioned in the indictment, upon him. ( Produced in court, and deposed to by the respective owners.)
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.



               Guilty

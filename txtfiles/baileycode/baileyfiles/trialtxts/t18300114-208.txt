RICHARD ROBERTS. I live with David Jones, a pawnbroker, in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On the 14th of December the prisoner came and brought a bridle, which he offered to pawn - Mr. Jones asked him where he bought it; he said of a person in St. Martin's-lane, but he did not tell his name; we sent for an officer.
CHARLES MAHEW. I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner; I produce the bridle.
GEORGE JOELL. I live with Mr. Samuel Wimbush and his partner, in Oxford-street


. They are job-masters and hackney-men
; I know this bridle to be theirs - it was lost out of a harness-room adjoining the stable on the 14th of December - the prisoner used to come to the yard to buy hay-bands; he came that day and asked for a man named Simmonds.

I produce a certificate from Mr. Clark's office, of the conviction of the prisoner on the 10th of April, in the 10th year of his present Majesty's reign, for stealing a bridle; he had fourteen days' imprisonment in Newgate - I was a witness, and know he is the person.

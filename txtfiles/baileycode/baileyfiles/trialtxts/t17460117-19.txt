             was indicted for 


               stealing two Shifts, &c.
             the Property of 
               
                  
                     Mary

                  Anne 
                  Cranford 
               



            . 
               
                  Anne 
                  Stanbury 
               



             was with me as a Charewoman
. Upon the 30th of December when I went up to Bed, I found a Pillow upon my Bed more than my own. I thought she might take it away from her Lodging. I reckon'd upon her coming in the Morning as usual. There were three Boxes of my Grand Mother's, which she had left in my Care, when my Mother died. When I got up in the Morning, and came to go down Stairs, one of these Boxes was like to fall down: They were up two Pair of Stairs, between two Rooms. One of the Boxes I found uncorded and open'd; then I mistrusted this 
               
                  Anne 
                  Stanbury 
               



             had robb'd me. I went to her Lodgings after her, early next Morning, but she had discharged her Lodgings and had not been home all Night. About the 3d of January I found her in Bunnel-Row. So I asked her how the Pillow came upon my Bed, and why she did not come as usual. My Dear Mistress, she answer'd, I knew I had wrong'd you and I was asham'd to see you. I told her of the Boxes: Indeed, my dear Mistress, says she, I was in Liquor and I uncorded them; but I will tell you what I have done with the Things, And she said, she would go with me to the Pawn-broker and fetch them out, if I would not let the Pawn-broker give her Trouble. So I went the next Morning to one Mr. Kiese's, Pawn-broker in Cheek-Lane. I went with her to another Pawnbroker, and she called for two Parcels more, at one Sharp's on Saffron-Hill. Then she said, she had given me all. I told her I could not release her 'till I had seen whether these were all the Things. Then I sent for my Mother; when she came there was nor half the Things. Then I went with her to the Alderman, and she sent to Kiese's for a Holland Apron, the same Pawn-broker she was at before. Then says she, my dear Mistress, I can tell you of more, but you cannot have them, for I have sold them out-right to a Pawn-broker in the Strand. She often used to say to me, she question'd not, but there were a great many good Things in these Boxes.
Q. You have got part of these Things then?


                  Anne 
                  Cranford 
               



            . Yes.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cranford 
               



             of Hamstead.) Have you look'd on these Things that were pawn'd, and in the Custody of your Grand-Daughter?


                  Mary 
                  Cranford 
               



            . Yes. They are mine, I left them at my Grand-Daughter's.
Q. How many Boxes were there?


                  Mary 
                  Cranford 
               



            . Three, and the Goods I have mention'd were in one of these Boxes.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner.) What have you to say for yourself?
Prisoner. My Mistress us'd to lend me Money, I being under Necessity. My Mistress order'd me to pawn them.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Anne 
                  Cranford 
               



            .) She therefore pawn'd these Things at your Desire?


                  Anne 
                  Cranford 
               



            . No indeed, please you my Lord, I should not have bidden her break these Boxes open; I have, indeed, lent her Money; 10 s. a Week she has had of me. 

               Guilty
            .

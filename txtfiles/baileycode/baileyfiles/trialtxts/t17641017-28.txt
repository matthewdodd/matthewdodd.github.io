            . I live in Whitechapel-fields


. I went from home, on the 4th of this instant, and at my return, at about three o'clock, I found my compting-house broke open, and my watch missing: I had employed the prisoner the day before. I pursued him, and took him, and offered him him half a crown if he would tell me where the watch was; by which means I got part of it again. I found one of the cases at a chandler's-shop, in Spittal-fields; the prisoner had sold it to the woman for 6 d. and he had bruised the other case, in order to get the work out, that a person had stopped, but the remainder of the watch I cannot find.

Prisoner's Defence.
I found the door open, and took the watch, and sold part of it at a chandler's-shop. I am fourteen years old.

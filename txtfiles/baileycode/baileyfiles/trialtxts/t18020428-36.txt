CHARLES BOREHAM sworn. - I am a shoemaker
, in Broad-street, Ratcliff


: On the 12th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, a lad, about twelve or thirteen years of age, came into the shop, and asked me to let him look at some half-boots, I was standing behind the counter; I shewed him a pair, and he said they were not the sort he wanted, they were not smart enough; he went towards the door, and I heard him whisper, be off, upon which I turned my head, and saw the prisoner at the bar take four pair of shoes from a box near the door, and run away with them; I went after him, and when he had got the distance of ten doors, he dropped the shoes; I followed him and brought him back to my shop.
Q. Are you sure he was the person that dropped the shoes? - A. Yes; I never lost sight of him, they are my shoes.
Prisoner's defence. I never touched them, I was going by the shop and heard that gentleman cry stop thief; I ran up to see what was the matter, and he laid hold of me.
The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.

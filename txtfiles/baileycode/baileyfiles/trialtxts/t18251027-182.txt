                  , from his person
            .
GEORGE WETTON. I am a baker
, and live with my father in Devonshire-street, Mile-end. I am nineteen years of age. I met the prisoner, who was alone, about half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 26th of September, in Whitechapel - I was quite sober - she asked me to go down Wentworth-street with her - I went to a house in Woodgate-court


, into a room on the left hand, up one pair of stairs - we were there alone - I had sixpence in my pocket, and that I gave her, and a few halfpence to get a candle - I took my breeches off, and folded them up carefully, and put them on a chair - I am certain my watch was then in the fob, because I tucked the ribbon of it down - I was not in the room above five minutes when another girl came in, and held me while the prisoner took my breeches out of the room - I got down as soon as I could, and got hold of the tail of my breeches - the prisoner swore at me like a trooper, and hit me over the head - I got the breeches, but the watch was gone - I am quite certain of her person - she was taken into custody two days afterwards, by my describing her person to the officer.

            . The prosecutor came to me on this night - he appeared perfectly sober - I talked with him for ten minutes - he described the two girls to me, and having some slight knowledge of such girls, I took them two days afterwards in Whitechapel.
Prisoner. I am not guilty.

            . Aged 17.

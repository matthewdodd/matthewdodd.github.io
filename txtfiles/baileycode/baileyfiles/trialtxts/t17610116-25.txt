            . The prisoner was a lodger to me.
Q. Where do you live?
J. Sharp. I live in Newen-yard, Shoreditch


.
Q. How long was she a lodger in your house?
J. Sharp. She lay seven nights in my house, in the same bed with me; I took her in, thinking her an honest person; she took an opportunity to take my gown out of my trunk.
Q. When did you miss it?
J. Sharp. The day after Christmas-day. I was drinking tea, and I took my key out of my pocket, and left it upon the table.
Q. When had you seen it last?
J. Sharp. I had not opened my trunk for three weeks before, or better.
Q. Where was the prisoner when you missed the gown?
J. Sharp. She went from me on the Saturday night, and I missed it on the Sunday.
Q. Where did you meet with her again?
J. Sharp. I found her in Moorfields, and asked her what she had done with the key of my trunk: she denied knowing any thing of it. Then I said, What have you done with my gown which you took out of my trunk? She denied that too; but at last she owned she had pawned it for ten shillings in Houndsditch. I went to the place where she directed me, and there I found it. [ Produced in court, and deposed to. ]
Prisoner. She lent me this gown, and I was to pay her 18 d. per week.
Q. to J. Sharp. Did you ever lend her that gown?
J. Sharp. No, never, neither to her or any mortal in the world. I have had it about 35 years, I did not use to wear it much myself.

            . I dwell in the house of the prosecutrix, she left the key on the table; and since the prisoner has been taken up, I heard her own that she took it, and went and took the gown the day after Christmas-day.
Q. When did she confess this?
Comber. She confessed this on a Sunday evening, in King-street, Moorfields, and said she had thrown the key down the vault.

Q. What is it made of?
Smith. It is a sort of damask, or sattin gown.
Q. What did you lend her upon it?
Smith. I lent her 10 s. upon it. I asked her whose it was; she said it was her mother's, who lived in Swan-alley, near Goodman's-fields; and that she had had it near 40 years.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Smith. No, I never saw her before.
Q. What time of the day did she bring it?
Smith. It was in the afternoon, before dusk.

            , a farmer
, who lives at Hornchurch. On the 9th of April, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I sold a ton of straw, and received 3l. 12s. for it, among which were ten shillings in halfpence, which I put in the body of my cart, and laid a truss of hay over them. As I was going up Whitechapel


, walking by the side of my horses, Armstrong informed me that I was robbed. I then missed the halfpence. I went with him and took the prisoners.

            . I am a stonemason, and live at Whitechapel. I saw the prisoner, Francis, in the prosecutor's cart-Bowyer, and two others, were walking by the side of it. I suspected them. I saw Francis put a paper into his hat, he then got out and joined the other three. I told the carman. While I was talking to him they ran up a court - I pursued, and heard the halfpence rattle. I seized Francis, and told Lincoln to take Bowyer, by the Red Bull steps-Francis had some halfpence in his waistcoat-pocket, and the paper broken; Bowyer had some in his coat-pocket, loose. I found the amount of 4s. 6d. on them. I believe that they took the other paper of halfpence - They offered to return them if we would let them go. Bowyer ran away, but I took him again immediately.

            . I am an officer. I saw the half-pence found on the prisoners. I produce the paper.

, of Salisbury-square


. On the 13th of April, about twelve o'clock, I was at the bottom of the warehouse, and heard a noise; I ran forward, and missed a ream of paper from about six yards from the door - I ran into the square, and received information; I went into St. Bride's-passage, and there saw the prisoner - I overtook him in Fleet-street, with the paper on his shoulder; I collared him, and made him bring it back to the warehouse; he said a person had given it to him to carry to Shee-lane, but he was not going towards Shoe-lane - we gave him in charge.

THOMAS MOORE
. I am a hatter, and live in St. James's-street. The prisoner Baker was my errand boy—I do not know Ball—I went down into my shop on the 23rd of February, at a quarter before seven o'clock, from suspicions which I had—I there saw the two prisoners at the shop window, which is in a line with the street door—Ball had a bat-box, with a hat in it, in his hand—they appeared to be talking—I was at some distance, and waited to watch them—after a minute or two, Ball, who had the hat, walked deliberately out of the shop—I followed him, and asked what he had got—he said, a hat, and he had got it out of the shop—he endeavoured to get away, but I collared and pulled him into the shop, and he said, "It was not the other boy's fault; I frightened him into it;" and Baker immediately said, "It is the first one"—I have missed other hats besides this—I found this hat in the box—I had not sold it.

Ball. When the Magistrate asked if I said any thing to him, he said no—I think he has a partner. Witness. No—my partnership was dissolved on the 1st of January, this year.





JOHN WHALL
 (police-constable C 63.) I received charge of the prisoners, with the hat and box—I heard Ball say he had frightened Baker to give him the hat, and it was the first one he had taken; and after that Baker stated to me that he was to meet Ball that evening, and he was to give him part of the money for it.

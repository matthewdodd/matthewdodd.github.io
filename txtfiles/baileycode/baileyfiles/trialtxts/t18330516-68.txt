            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I was in Coppice-row on the 24th of April, about a quarter past four o'clock - I met the prisoner with one of these coats on, and the other over his arm - I had seen him an hour before without them, and desired him to stop; he said the coats were his own - the prosecutor afterwards identified them.

            . One of these coats is mine, and the other is my brother's - they were taken from our counting-house in James-street, Gray's-inn-lane


 - the doors were shut, but might not have been locked - I saw them safe at two o'clock that day.
Prisoner's Defence. I was in Coppice-row and met John Wall with these coats, he said he was going to my place with them for me to alter; I said I would take them home and do them directly - I was going along andmet the officer who took me - I sent my father to the person I had them from in Popham-street, Islington, but he had absconded.

JOHN MARCHANT. I live in Dartmouth-street, Westminster


. The prisoner lodged in my house on the 6th of November. I missed my coat and trousers from my bed-room; the prisoner was at the office on some other charge; and she directed us to the pawnbroker; her husband is a butcher.

            . I am an officer. I was taking the prisoner to Tothill-fields. I made her no promise or threat; but she told me this property was pawned at Stocks and Co.'s; I went there next day with Marchant, and found them.

Prisoner's Defence. I said I thought they were there. He said he would give me 2s. to tell him where they were; I saw a person coming out of the room with them, but I did not take them.
JOHN LANGLEY. It is false. She told me she had pawned them, but had lost the duplicate.

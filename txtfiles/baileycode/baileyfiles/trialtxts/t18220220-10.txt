; he took the handkerchief out, and turned the corner of Angel-street with his companions - I pursued and took him with it in his hand; he called to hiscompanions, and one of them came back, and gave me a blow on the head, the other ran against me, and broke my hold, and he got away for a few seconds - I knocked his companions down, and laid hold of the prisoner at Butcherhall-lane without losing sight of him; I could not find the gentleman, he had a lady with him. I gave the handkerchief to Taylor.

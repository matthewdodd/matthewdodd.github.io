            . I drive a jobb
, and the stable is at the French-horn, High-holbourn


. I went out of the stable, and pull'd the door too: when I returned, I found the prisoner in the stable, and ordered him out of the yard.
Q. Did you know him before?
Stevens. No, I did not. Then I went to prepare the coach; and returning to the stable again, I met the prisoner coming out, with my coat and waistcoat under his arm: I took them from him, and secured him. (Produced and deposed to). This was last Friday, about four in the afternoon.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never saw the things.

            . I am a weaver, keep a public house
, and live in Well-street Shoreditch



. Linsey is my apprentice
; for these five or six weeks I have continually missed money out of a closet in my dining-room, which is next to my bed-chamber. On the 29th of last month we missed two guineas and a handful of silver. My wife and I concluded that she should be locked into the closet to watch; she can best give the court an account what happened.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. My daughter went up with me and locked me into the closet and carried her father the key; there is no key-hole on the inside. After I had been there about two hours, or more, Linsey came to the door and shook it as if he would have shook it to pieces; then he stopped a little and shook it again; he had something in the key-hole, what I cannot tell. Then he shook it again, and the door flew open. I said, Is it you, and called out and knocked with my foot; then they came up and he was taken and examined; he confessed he had taken four shillings that week, and had been there twice before and no more. The prisoner wanted to make his escape.

            . I went with the prosecutor and the prisoner Linsey. I heard him say he had taken four shillings of his master's money and gave it to the other prisoner, and that he had but two-pence halfpenny out of it.
Linsey's Defence.
I did not own to the breaking the lock neither the times before not that neither; the door was open. I do not believe it was locked.

 for stealing 1 watch, value 17s.; and 1 watch-guard, 17s.; the goods of 



Mary Stephenson.






MART STEPHENSON
. I am single, and live in the Commercial-road, Lambeth—I let apartments weekly. On the 28th of Sept. the prisoner came to take my apartments—I have no doubt whatever that he is the person—he gave the name of Mr. Davies—he was there about ten minutes—he asked for a piece of paper, and I went into the kitchen to fetch it—as soon as he was gone I missed a silver watch—I had seen it when he went into the room—no one else had been into the room—there was no one in the house but me—no one could have taken it but him.

Prisoner's Defence. It is entirely false.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . The Prisoner White was my apprentice

. On the 7th of July my house, which is close to my shop at Limehouse bridge


, was broke open. The neighbours call'd out to me, that there were thieves in my house, upon which I got up, and call'd Rose! Keeper! and t'other dog's name - a young puppy that I have, and they all fell a roaring like mad. I then thought there could not be thieves in the house, but however I ran up stairs, and White was gone, I perceived; so I struck a light and went to the street door, and saw him (White) coming in. I ask'd him where he had been? He said he could not sleep, and had been to take a walk: What, says I, do you walk without shoes? He said he was very hot, so I took him in, and told him, he or somebody else had robb'd me, and I took a stick and 'nointed him heartily. After this I set him to work, and got a pipe of tobacco, and watch'd him a little while, and then I call'd up my foreman and went to bed. When I got up again, I order'd 1200 of bolt staves, which I knew the weight of, to be weigh'd over again; and then White desired my foreman to save him, and say there was an hundred weight more than there was. The foreman informing me of this, I told the boy, if my cane was a sword I would run him through, and ask'd him what he had done with the Iron, and he told me, Gray had got them in his house. Upon this I went to Justice Jones and got a search warrant; and when I came to Gray's house there he was sitting with his back against a closet, but I took him from thence, and found 96 lb. of my iron standing upright in the closet before me. When I had found my iron, Gray fell on his knees, and both he and his wife offer'd me a bond of 50 l. to let him go; but I told him he must expect nothing from me but what the law directed.

             confirm'd the above deposition.
Pris. White. This man is innocent of it; I carried it to his house.
Gray. He brought it to my house, and desir'd me to let him leave it there, and said he would fetch it again next morning.
The court was of opinion that Gray could not be affected by this indictment, therefore directed the jury to acquit him, and recommended it to the Prosecutor to prefer a bill against him, as an accessary after the fact.
Gray 


               acquitted
            , White 


               guilty Felony only
            .

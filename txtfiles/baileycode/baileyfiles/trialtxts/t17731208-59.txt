            ; my hat was taken from my head a little after nine at night, on the 30th of October, as I was going along Fetter-lane

            . On the 30th of October, a little after nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner running, and some people pursuing him; he was pursued into Roll's Buildings; there I saw him drop the hat; I took it up; (the hat produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix). I think the prisoner is the person. I am certain he is the man.
Prisoner's Defence.
There are two turnings there, I suppose the person went the other turning: I was walking slow eating an apple.
Mr. Barker. He was not walking slow, he was running, nor was he eating an apple.

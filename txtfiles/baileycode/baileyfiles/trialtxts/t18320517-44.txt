            . I am the wife of William Haig. On the 10th of April, at near half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Westminster


, and being unacquainted with the streets, I inquired of Jessamin the nearest way to a coach-stand; he directed me, and had just left me when a man came and struck me very violently on my back, and took a shawl from me - I turned round as soon as I could, and saw the prisoner running, pursued by Jessamin; he and the officer brought the prisoner and the shawl to the station.
WILLIAM JESSAMIN. I am a soldier. I was at Westminster on the 10th of April, and directed this lady to a coach-stand - I then went on, and heard her call out that she had lost her shawl; I turned, and saw the prisoner running - I pursued, cried Stop thief! and took him with the shawl.

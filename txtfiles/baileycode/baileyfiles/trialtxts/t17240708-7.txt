             came to the Prosecutor's House and called for Drink, and there was at the same time a poor Man drinking in the House, which they quarrelled with, and beat out of Doors, that afterwards they wanted to have a Guinea chang'd, that she went up into the Chamber to get Change for a Guinea, and had taken the Money out of a Box, and had told out a Guinea worth of Silver upon the Bed, and was going to put the rest which was in a Purse, up in the Box again, when the Prisoner unexpectedly came behind her, threw her down on the Bed, and used her rudely, and took the Money from her, and went away. She could not be positive as to the Sum of Money, but thought it was about 40 s. The Prisoner did not deny the Fact, but pleaded, he was in Drink, and was put upon it by Edward Rosse. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 39 s.

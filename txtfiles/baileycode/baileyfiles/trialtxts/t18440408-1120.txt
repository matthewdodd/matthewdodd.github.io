RICHARD LOWE
 was indicted

 for stealing 75 1/2 yards of hessian, Value 1l. 15s., the goods of 



George Sparks; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE SPARKS
. I live in Swan-street, Minories. I saw this piece of hessian cloth safe, on the 20th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—this is it—there are seventy-five yards and a half of it—I did not miss it till next morning—I know it by my mark upon it, "G. S."—it corresponds in quantity exactly with what I had.





CATHERINE JANE SPARKS
. I am the prosecutor's daughter. I saw this cloth safe at half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 20th of March.





HENRY FINNIS
 (City police-constable, No, 625.) About twenty minutes to eight o'clock in the evening, on the 20th of March, I saw the prisoner carrying this cloth on his shoulder in Hounds-ditch, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, and coming as if from there—I asked what he had got, and where he was going—he said, "Up this court"—he threw the cloth down, and van off—he was taken in my sight, and I took it up.

Prisoner. I was not the person that had it Witness. He had got about fifty yards from it before he was taken, but did not get out of my sight—I was close to him.

Prisoner's Defence. I Was going to purchase a jacket, and a man caught hold of me, hearing a cry of "Stop thief;" the officer came up and said, "I think you are the person;" it was dark, and he could not see me.





THOMAS DUNGLESON
 (City police-constable, No. 102.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

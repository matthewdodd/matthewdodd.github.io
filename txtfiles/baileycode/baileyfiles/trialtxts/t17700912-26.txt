            . I am servant to Mr. Hartwell, who is a linen-draper
 at Charing-cross


. On the 27th of July, between eight and nine in the morning, the two prisoners came into Mr. Hartwell's shop, and desired to look at some clear lawn. I shewed them some; they bought a quarter of a yard, and paid for it; after they had been out of the shop about two minutes, I missed a remnant of lawn. I went over the way to Mr. Wilson, the constable, and desired him to assist me. We followed the prisoners, who were then in sight; when we overtook them, I asked them if they had not stolen something; they denied it; we took them to Justice Keeling's, where the lawn was found upon Carroll.

            . I am a constable. I found this piece ( producing it ) between Carroll's legs.
Page's Defence.
I was a servant
 out of place. I met Carroll; she asked me if I would go with her to buy a piece of lawn to make a cap.
Carroll's Defence.
I met with Page. I asked her to go with me, to buy a piece of lawn. I know nothing about that piece.

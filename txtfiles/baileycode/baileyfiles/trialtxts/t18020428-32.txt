Q. Are you sure you saw her take it? - A. Yes.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Has not the prisoner dealt at your shop these nine or ten years? - A. I have only been there since January.
Q. She used to deal there? - A. Yes; for twist.

             sworn. - I partly undrest the prisoner, and then she took a ball of twist from under her stays, and said, that was all she had taken.
The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.

            . I am bar-maid at the George inn, Acton


, it is kept by

                  Ann Latham
               



            . On the 5th of February, while she was out, I saw the prisoner come there to beg; I saw him just outside the bar, after I had told him to go away - as soon as he was gone I saw the till open; I sent the ostler after him - he brought him back, and produced nine sixpences, one shilling, and one farthing; I know one of these sixpences, it is cracked and black - I know there was one shilling and one farthing in the till.

             (Police-constable T 12). I took the prisoner at the Geroge - the ostler had hold of his collar; I found this money in his hand.

JOHN JENKINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of August, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Banbridge Bell, from his person.






BANBRIDGE BELL
. On the morning of the 1st of August, I was in Crutched-friars, about half-past eleven o'clock. I heard somebody call out "He has got your handkerchief"—I turned round, and found the prisoner in charge of a policeman—I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—the policeman was in the act of pulling something out of his trowsers pocket.

Prisoner. I picked it up—I saw it fall down, and this was the nearest gentleman to it—as I was going along, the policeman caught hold of me and took it out of my hand.





CHARLES CHAMBERS
 (City police-constable, No. 42.) On the 1st of August, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two other following the prosecutor—the prisoner waved his hand for the others to close up behind him to conceal him, which they did, and at that moment I saw him lay hold of the prosecutor's pocket, and saw him take the hand kerchief out and put it into his own trowsers pocket—I secured him, took it out of his pocket, and called to the prosecutor—I saw him take it—I was close to him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. It is my first offence—I hope you will have compassion on me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

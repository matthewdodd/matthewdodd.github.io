567. 




THOMAS LETFORD
 was again indicted

 for forging an acceptance to a bill of exchange, with intent to defraud 



Abel Birch.






ABEL BIRCH
. I am a furnishing-undertaker, at Middle-row, Knightsbridge. On 27th Sept. the prisoner came and brought this bill, at three months, dated 4th Sept., accepted by Anthony Harrison, payable of the Lord Nelson, King's-road—I have known him between twenty and thirty years—the prisoner asked me to give him the difference, deducting a bill I had of him in the early part of August—I gave him 9l. 6s.—I was induced to do so from the knowledge I had of Mr. Harrison, who had just retired from business.





ANTHONY HARRISON
. I kept the Lord Nelson—I left it on 13th May—I live in Queen's-cottage, New-road, Hammersmith. I know the prisoner—he kept the Lowndes Arms public-house—the acceptance to this bill is not my writing, and it is misspelt in two places.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How long have you know the prisoner? A. Several years—I thought him a respectable man—I never had any bill transaction with him.





JAMES WEBSTER JONES
 (policeman, B 59.) I took the prisoner—he was told it was for forging two bills of exchange—he said it was a bad job.
(Edward Rowe, of the Boar's Head, Exeter-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 56.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.—


Transported for Seven Years.

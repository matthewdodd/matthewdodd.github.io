                  , from his person
            .
JOHN FREDERICK AUGUSTUS GRIESBACH. I live in Nicols-square, Falcon-square, and am in the lace trade
. On the evening of the 28th of January I was in Fleet-street, going towards Exeter-change; I had left home about half an hour, and near Temple-bar


, on the Chancery-lane side of the way, I felt a pull at my pocket; I saw the prisoner running, and pursued; a friend, who was with me, stopped him in Essex-street; the handkerchief lay within two yards of his feet - nobody else was passing.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in the Strand - the gentleman charged me with picking his pocket - a young man picked a handkerchief up a few yards off.

1938. 




JAMES KAIN
 and 




JOHN FARRELL
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
6th of June, 9 ivory balls, value 1l. 7s. 6d., the goods of 




Robert Edward Docking.






ROBERT EDWARD DOCKING
. I am the landlord of the Coach and Horses, in Bunhill-row. On the 6th of June the prisoners were drinking in the tap-room—they afterwards went up stairs to play at bagatelle—I have lost nine ivory balls, worth 1l. 7s. 6d.—they have not been found.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHARNOCK. Q. Is this a public room? A. Yes—the prisoners went into the room about four o'clock, and went away about half-past five—I was sitting in the bar all the evening, and not a soul went up stairs after them, and none but them—I missed the balls at eight o'clock.





JOHN REIS
. I and three fellow-workmen were in the room—I remember the prisoners playing with these balls at bagatelle—Farrell was the last person who was playing—Kain came about half-an-hour after the other was there—I left them at half-past five o'clock—Farrell was amazing himself with the balls, and Kain looking on—no persons were left in the room but the two prisoners—my fellow-workmen went with me—I saw eight white balls there, and one red one.





JAMES GROOM
. I am pot-boy at this house. Farrell was the last person I saw playing in this room, and Kain was looking on—four of De la Rue's men were in the room—they went, and the two prisoners only were left—I saw them go away after the other men were gone—I cannot swear whether any other persons came after they left.





JAMES BRANNAN
. I am a police-sergeant I took the prisoners—they denied it.

KAIN—



GUILTY
. Aged 36.—




Confined Nine Months.

FARRELL*—



GUILTY
. Aged 24.—



Transported for Seven Years. (There was another indictment against the prisoners.)

WILLIAM PAYNE BARNARD. I am a linen draper
, 86, Bishopsgate-street


. On the 26th of December, about five in the evening, in company with another came to my shop door, they asked the price of things that hanged about the door, I missed a shawl from the door, I jump-over the counter, the prisoners saw me coming, they crossed the road, I followed them and took the prisoner, Moore, with the shawl upon her; I brought her back to the shop and sent for an officer.

            . I was coming down Bishopsgate street on Wednesday evening about five o'clock, there were three of them stopped together, one stooped, the other unpinned the shawl, and the other took it; the gentleman came out crossed the way and took the woman with the shawl.
Moore's Defence. I picked up the shawl like another fool from off the pavement; if I had twenty pound I would not pick it up again.
Galponey's Defence. I happened to stop at the door like another fool as I was, seeing a mob.

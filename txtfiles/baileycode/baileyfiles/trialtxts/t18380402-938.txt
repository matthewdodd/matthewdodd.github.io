CORNELIUS CARTER
. I am a chemist. About half-past ten o'clock on Saturday morning, I was looking into a shop window in Gracechurch-street, and saw, by reflection in the window, my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—I turned, and he ran off—I followed him—he went up a court and dropped my handkerchief—I took it up, but still followed, and took him.

Prisoner. I picked it up at his feet. Witness. It could not have fallen—it was in the inside pocket of a dress-coat—when I took the prisoner, he begged of me to forgive him.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the 22nd of December I saw the prisoner with a quartern loaf under each arm, and knowing him, I followed him - he looked round, saw me, and began to run; I caught him in Wimpole-street - I took hold of one of the loaves, and it broke; he said he had bought them - he struck and kicked me several times, but with assistance I took him to the station.
Prisoner. He said, "D-n you, you rogue, I have had you before." Witness. I did not.

            . I missed these two loaves, when the officer told me of it; I know they are my master's - they were taken from my barrow at the corner of the New-road

            . On the 11th of December the things mentioned were taken away by the prisoner, who had been in our house that day; when she came again I challenged her with it. She was taken up stairs and searched by some women, who can give the court an account of it. The spoons were in my wife's pocket, which were gone also.

            . In searching the prisoner, I felt the spoon in her stocking, and Mrs. Clark took it out.
Mrs. Clark. I saw Mrs. Brittain take a handkerchief out of the prisoner's bosom. There were 2 s. and a silver buckle tied up in one corner of it; and I took the spoon out of her left leg stocking.
The constable produced the spoon and handkerchief.
Q. to Brittain. Are these your property?
Brittain. This is the spoon these women delivered to me after they had searched her. It is my property.

I was coming by the prosecutor's house about 8 o'clock in the evening. There was a great croud coming out at the door, and there I found the pocket with the spoon in it. I went in to let them know I had got it, and they took me away before the justice.

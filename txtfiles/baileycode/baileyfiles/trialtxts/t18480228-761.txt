JOHN POLLEN.
 I am a hosier, at 36 and 37 Aldgate—I have one partner. On 12th Feb., between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to the shop—Lee undid four pairs of stockings, which were tied to as iron rod outside, and gave them to Davis—they went away—I sent my young man to follow them—they got to the next door—I saw Davis throw down the stockings—I picked them up, brought the prisoners into the shop, and gave them in charge—Lee went on her knees and implored me to forgive her.

Lee. Q. Were not we both very tipsy? A. No.

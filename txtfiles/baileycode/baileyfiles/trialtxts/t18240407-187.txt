. On the 25th of March, about half-past five o'clock the prisoner came to the shop with three other women - the prisoner produced the duplicate of a shawl, pawned for 12 s. I suspected, and watched them; one of the others handed me a cloak, which she pretended she had picked off the floor. The prisoner proposed giving me 9 s., and leaving another shawl in pawn for 3 s. I went round the corner, and missed a piece of cotton, and said,
"One of you have got a piece of cotton." I saw the prisoner move - she shifted her clothes, and the cotton fell at her feet; it could not fall from the others. All three were in company. I was attending to a customer part of the time. I am sure that she dropped it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had not enough money to redeem the shawl; somebody came to the door and asked the price of something; he saw the cotton on the floor, and said, somebody had dropped it. I was rather saucy, and so he said it was me.

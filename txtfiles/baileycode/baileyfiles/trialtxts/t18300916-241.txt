             was my shopman
 - he resided in my house, and had to open the shop about seven o'clock in the morning; I placed the greatest confidence in him - he had been sixteen months in my service; some suspicion arose in my mind- on the 3rd of August I went down into the cellar, and concealed myself under the window, where I could see and hear what passed in the shop; he opened the shop about seven o'clock, and soon after Eliza Evans, his sister,(the other prisoner) came in - there was a man then in the shop; she waited till he was gone, and when 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Evans
               



             had served the customer he went to the butter-scale, took a piece of butter, put it on another piece, and put it into this basket; he said, "You use a precious sight of butter, I don't know what you do with it" - he had not weighed it, and no money passed between them; he then went to the counter on the other side, and said to her, "Has mother sent those things?" she said, "No, she was out all day yesterday;" he said, "I will blow her up well. she ought not to mind what she does for me, see what I do for her"- he was then in the act of cutting a cushion of bacon; he cut off, I think, not less than 4lbs., but did not weigh it, nor appear to take any money, or change any - he put that into a piece of paper, and then into the basket; she then said to him, "Mother says she wants," but the remainder of the sentence I could not catch - he said, "I shall do no such thing, take what you have got, and be contented"- he was then going to a basket of eggs, and took out as many as he could hold in two hands; he put them into the basket; Eliza Evans shut down the lid, and went away - I came up the cellar stairs in about a minute, and made a signal, which had been agreed on, to my friend Shields, which was to throw out my arm; I then turned to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Evans
               



            , and said, "Well, Thomas, how long has this game being going on?" he said, "What game, Sir?" I said, "What has just taken place;" he affected not to understand me - I said, "Very well, I will see about it;" I went to the door, and saw the Policeman - I gave him in charge; he then asked for forgiveness, and said it was the first time - I had not made him any promise or threat; the child was brought forward afterwards.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. In what situation is the door? A. In the centre - the right-hand is the butter side, and the other the bacon side; the bacon window was covered over - I could see what I have stated; there was a - lb. weight in the scale previous to his placing the butter into it, but he did not weigh it - I had no character with him; his clothes went home to be washed - I believe this girl sometimes brought his things; his mother dealt with me, but very seldom had credit; I never recollect this little girl fetching things on credit - I think he was taken in about ten minutes afterwards; he could not intend to place them down to his mother, as he did not weigh them - this little girl is from eleven to twelve years of age; she was taken at Bethnal-green, about two hundred yards from my shop.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say there was a - lb. weight in the scale? A. yes, but the quantity of butter he gave her was from 1 lb. to 1 1/2lb. - he did not weigh the bacon, nor appear to count the eggs.

            . By desire of the prosecutor I waited at some distance from his shop - there was a lad placed opposite, who was to convey the intelligence to me; I had been watching two mornings before in the same place, and had seen this little girl each of those mornings, about seven o'clock - on the third morning I received intimation from my boy; I waited till she came to the corner, at the Salmon and Ball - I stopped her, and asked what she had in her basket; I do not recollect precisely what she said, but she wished to push me off, and would not allow me to see - I wished to take hold of the basket; she rather resisted - I took her into the Salmon and Ball, and examined the contents, which were these articles; I asked where she got them - she began to cry; I asked what she had in her other hand, and found this half-crown - she cried, and said she wanted to go to her mother.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you see her enter the shop? A. Yes, but not come out; she went in about five minutes after seven o'clock, and we took her eight or ten minutes after.
- SHIELDS. I saw this little girl come out of the shop, and gave the signal to my father.

            . I am a constable, and took her in charge.
Thomas Evans' Defence. It was my intention to book these things - I weighed them; Mr. Savage would not give me time to book them before he came out of the cellar.

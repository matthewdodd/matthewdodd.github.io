            . I am the wife of Peter Clisswold,a tobacconist
 - we live in Brewer-street, Somer's-town


. On the 21st of December I saw all the prisoners about the shop-window, but suspected nothing; I went into the parlour, and in half a minute turned round, and saw Alfred going out of the shop; I ran out, and missed three snuff-boxes from the window - I am sure the prisoners were altogether; I ran round the corner, saw the same three boys, and called Stop thief! but there was nobody to stop them - I saw each of them throw a box down the area, and throw some down in the street; I picked up one - I swear they are the boys: I could not run fast enough to take them.

            . I saw the prisoners together near the prosecutrix's shop - I heard them say sneak in; Alfred Jenkins went in, he came out again in half a minute, and they all ran away together.

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoners - the prosecutrix gave me three boxes.(Property produced and sworn to.)

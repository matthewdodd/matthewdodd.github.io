SAMUEL PARTRIDGE. I am a saddler
. On the 10th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I had a pocketbook in my outside coat pocket, when I was at the Saracen's Head inn; I went from there to Friday-street, from there to Long-lane, and from there to Holborn - I missed my pocket-book there and saw it again the same evening.

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the corner of Long-lane, Smithfield


 - I saw twogentlemen at the corner - the prisoner Boak came from behind them - he put something in his left hand trousers' pocket, which I thought was a handkerchief; I looked round and saw Fowkes following the gentleman. I took them both into custody and found the pocket-book on Boak.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
BOAK'S Defence. I was coming down Long-lane, and a boy gave me the book, and told me to come along with him - we were looking at it when the officer took us.

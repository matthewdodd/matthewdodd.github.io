JOHN MERRETON
. I keep the Sportsman public-house, in the City-road. The prisoner was my pot-boy—my wife missed various sums of money, in consequence of which I was induced, on Thursday evening before I went to bed, to leave five marked shillings, six fourpenny-pieces, and 5s. 2d. in copper—I fastened the till up, locked the bar-door, and went to bed—soon after six o'clock in the morning, hearing the prisoner come down, I placed myself in the water-closet—he went and unlocked the door and went towards the till—I could see him through a fan-light—I went down to—the fan-light, saw him return from the till, lock the door after him, and proceed out to the pot-house, to his work—I went up and dressed myself, went to the bar, opened it, and called him to take the shutters down, which he did—I then said, "Thomas, you have robbed me this morning; I saw you come into the bar, open the till, and return and lock the door after you "—he said, "God bless you, master, I have not"—I said, "You have, and 1 insist on your giving up the key"—he said he had not got one—I made him turn his pockets out—there was one marked shilling and four sixpences—I said it was mine—he said it was not—I made him return to his work, and that moment my wife came down stairs—I went out at the back-door, and told the policeman—I then returned back and settled my accounts with him, and gave him in charge—I

have the marked shilling which I found on him—he had a private key to unlock the door.

Prisoner. Q. Where is that key? A. I do not know; but you unlocked the door in my sight—I have lost various sums of money.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not unlock the door; I went to the bar to see the time; the shilling was in my possession the night before.




GUILTY. Aged 19.—Recommended to mercy.

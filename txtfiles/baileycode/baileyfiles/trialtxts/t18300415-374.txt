            . On the 24th of February I was against the Rose-inn, Smithfield


, at a quarter-past two o'clock; the prisoner came running up, drew my watch out of my pocket, and ran down West-street; I followed, and overtook him, without losing sight of him - I saw him throw the watch away, but I got it.

            . I took the prisoner on the 24th of February, at twenty minutes after three o'clock - I saw a crowd outside the door of an eating-house - I went up, and they said, "You are wanted here - a man has been robbed of his watch;" I went in, and the prosecutor had the prisoner.

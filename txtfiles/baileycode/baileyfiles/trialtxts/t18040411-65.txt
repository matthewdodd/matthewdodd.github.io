                  THOMAS 
                  EVANS
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am inspector of casks for the Committee of Brewers.
Q. In consequence of any information, did you go to Mr. Sykes's house, in Gray's Inn lane? - A. On the 12th of March, Mr. Sellon applied for a warrant to enquire of Mr. Sykes; Mr. Sykes keeps the Sun, in Gray's Inn lane





; I went there with some Officers from Hatton-garden; we found Mr. Sykes at home; we told him we were informed that he had some beer belonging to Mr. Sellon on his premises; he said he had a barrel of beer that a man left there until he called for it; it was in the cellar, at the bottom of the stairs; I found the barrel full of beer; I asked him if there was any thing else; he said, no; I went further into the cellar with the warrant, and there we found a half-hogshead, empty, of Mr. Sellon's; we went over the premises, and found nothing more belonging to Mr. Sellon; I left the Officer with Sykes till I got a dray to take the two casks away.
Q. Are you sure the casks are Mr. Sellon's? - A. Yes; they have the mark of Mr. Sellon.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Does it not frequently occur that casks belonging to one brewer
 get mixed with another brewer's casks? - A. No doubt.
Q. With a publican who deals with four or five different brewers, it frequently occurs that mistakes happen, in a fair regular course of trade? - A. It certainly does.
Q. Mr. Meux's casks may get along with Mr. Sellon's, and vice versa. -
Court. Q. Does it happen, in course of business, that these casks get exchanged, suppose Mr. Meux takes the cask, and sends it out with beer? - A. A man may get one cask by way of another, by way of mistake.
Q. Suppose Mr. Meux takes Mr. Sellon's cask, and fills it again, does it happen they fill it again? - A. It does happen so.
Q. What were these casks, a small beer cask or what? - A. They may be used either for strong or small.

Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you sure that was the house? - A. Yes, now I am sure; I was a stranger in that quarter.

Q. How soon did you tell this? - A. The inspector of the casks spoke of it first, then I told of it.

- HANCOCK sworn. - I am one of the Police officers of Hatton-garden; I went with a warrant to Sykes's house; I went with Mr. Evans, and in Mr. Sykes's cellar I found a cask of beer, and an empty cask, said by Mr. Evans to be the property of Mr. Sellon; and after Mr. Evans went to fetch the dray to take the beer away, Mr. Sykes was left in my custody; during the time he went, Mr. Sykes behaved very well; when Mr. Evans returned to take the beer away, during the time they were loading the dray, Mr. Sykes being then in my custody, withdrew into the back kitchen; at that time I did not know there was a door that leads into the yard from the back kitchen, I knew there was a window that came into the yard; Mr. Sykes went out of the door into the back kitchen, and got over the water-but and over the wall; I said nothing at the time, but rushed out of the door, and turned to the left up a stable-yard, and caught Mr. Sykes by the jacket; Mr. Sykes told me, when I laid hold of him, it was not his intention to escape, and desired that I would not hold him; I told him I was obliged to secure him, in order that he might not escape; I told him he was very much to blame, and we went into the kitchen again, nothing more passed; then I took him to the Police-office.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mr. Sykes told you he did not mean to escape - did not the Magistrate take his word for his appearance? - A. I believe he did.
Q. He was admitted to bail, and he came here and surrendered himself? - A. Yes.
Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not that at the request of Meux's house that he was admitted to bail? - A. I believe it was.
(The casks produced, and identified to be the property of Mr. Sellon by Mr. Evans.)
WILLIAM-MARMADUKE SELLON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mr. Sellon, have you any partner? - A. No.
Q. Is Mr. Sykes any customer of your's? - A. No, he never was.
Q. The other prisoner, Jackson, was a servant of your's - how long has he been so? - A. About ten months.
Q. There are no orders for beer without your knowledge? - A. Whatever directions are sent to my brewhouse cannot be sent to the customers till I have set my initials on the margin; they cannot send from my brewhouse till I have set my regular mark.
Q. What beer is that? - A. It is small beer.
Q. Publicans cannot have small beer in their cellars? - A. They are liable to an information if they have.
- ROADS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you apprehend 
               Jackson
             the same day? - A. Yes, I was sent for to take him into custody.
Q. Did any thing pass at the time? - A. He said that the man that had turned against him ought to have something said against him, because he was to have part.
Q. Are you sure that was the expression? - A. He ought to have suffered with him, or instead of him; he ought to have suffered, because he was to have part.
Jackson's defence. That beer, your Lordship, was my property, I will prove it, which all dray-men have; it is the bottom of the casks that all draymen have.
For the prisoner, Jackson.

                  CHUBB
               



             sworn. - I am a cooper, I live in Foster's-buildings, Whitecross-street, I work on my own account; I have known Jackson above ten years, he was a fellow-servant of mine at Mr. Bond's brewhouse; I always found him an honest man, and I always understood that the drains belonged to the drayman.
Court. Q. Did you ever know instances of their taking beer home, the drains from different barrels from different customers, to the master's house, and then fill it into the master's barrels, and take it out and sell it; I will take it down in writing, if you will swear so? - A. No, not sell it, but they take it home; I always understood it was their perquisites.
Court. You do not understand any such thing; you only come here to perjure yourself.
The prisoner, Jackson, called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.
The prisoner, Sykes, said nothing in his defence, but called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

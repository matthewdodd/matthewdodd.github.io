. These eight shoes were safe on Saturday, the 15th of July; I hung them up on some nails, expecting a person to call for them - on the Monday morning I missed them. I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . On the morning of the 17th of August I was in Old-street about two o'clock, with two other officers; I stopped the two prisoners; on John Ballard I found two shoes under his waistcoat, and in his breeches pocket I found four keys, one of which fits the padlock of the shop.

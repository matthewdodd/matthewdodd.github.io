            . I keep a shop
. On the 27th of February, my servant saw the prisoner take the cottage stuff from my window; I saw the prisoner brought back, and the stuff.

                  WHIFFEN
               



            . I saw the man take the stuff from the window; he gave it to the prisoner; they both ran away; I pursued the prisoner about an hundred yards; he dropped the stuff; I picked it up. A man stopped the prisoner; we delivered him to a constable. I am quite sure he is the lad that ran away with it, and dropped it; I took it up. This is the piece of stuff that was taken from the window; it is my mistress's property.

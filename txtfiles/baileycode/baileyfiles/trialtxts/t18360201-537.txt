JOSEPH MURRAY
 and 




JOHN HALLISEY
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
27th of January, 1 pair of stockings, value 1s., the goods of 



William Christopher Atkinson.






JOSEPH MICKLEFIELD
. I am assistant to Mr. Ashbridge, pawnbroker, in Broad-street, Ratcliffe. On the afternoon of the 27th of January, the prisoner Murray came to the shop, and offered to pawn a pair of new worsted stockings—I asked him who he pawned them for—he said, for his mother—on looking towards the window, I observed two or three boys waiting for him outside—I cannot say whether Hallisery was one of them—I said I must detain him—he said if I did I must pay him for his loss of time—when the officer came I gave him in charge, with the stockings.





CHARLES PATTEN
 (police-constable K 206.) I took Murray to the station-house, and went to his mother, and on my return, he voluntarily said if I would let him out he would tell me all about it—he said, "I did not steal the stockings myself, a boy named Hallisey took them, and gave them to me to pawn, and I was to take the money to the Ship and Greendragon to share"—I afterwards took Hallisey at his grandmothers—I asked him if he knew what I wanted of him, he said, "Yes, for a pair of stockings I stole last night out of Old Gravel-lane, and I shall be transported; I have no home, my mother has turned me out these two years, and I am obliged to get my living by begging, or any thing I can. "





ANN ATKINSON
. I am the wife of William Christopher Atkinson, a haberdasher in Old Gravel-lane. I missed a pair of stockings from the inside shop-door, on the 27th of January, about half-past seven o'clock—I believe these to be the stockings—I have eleven pairs more like them—I saw nothing of either the prisoners at the shop.

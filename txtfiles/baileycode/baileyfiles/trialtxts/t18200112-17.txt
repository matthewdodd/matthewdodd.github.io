MANLY EMANUEL. I live in St. Martin's lane. On the 23d of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Canstatt's, who is a surgeon in Smithfield


, and left my umbrella in the shop. I missed it about ten o'clock, and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about it? as I suspected him. He said he knew nothing of it; he is the son of the person who keeps the shop. About ten days afterwards he behaved disorderly at home, and they gave him in charge of an officer, who found the duplicate on him.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Sparrow-corner, Minories. On the 23d of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner pledged an umbrella with me for 2 s.

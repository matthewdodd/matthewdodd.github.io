MICHAEL NEWSON. I am a steward in the East India Company's Service
. On the 24th of March, about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, I was in Duke's-place


, the prisoner came in front of me, caught hold of my watch-chain, gave it a sudden pull, which broke it, and left my watch in my fob - He ran about ten yards, and I took him - He resisted. I tore his coat behind, he then threw my chain down; I picked it up, Jones held him the while; he struck 
               Jones
             a violent blow on the neck. The officer came up and secured him.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. It was the Purim Fair in Duke's-place. There were not many people there. I had noticed him before. I never lost sight of him.
Q. Have you not said you doubted whether he was the man - A. No; my chain found just by him.

            . I was with Newson. I saw the prisoner come on the left side of the prosecutor, snatch his chain, and run off - We pursued, and stopped him; he threw the chain down, I held him while Newson picked it up-he struck me.
JAMES HARDING. I am an officer. I heard the cry, ran up, and saw Newson pick up his chain. I took the prisoner in charge.

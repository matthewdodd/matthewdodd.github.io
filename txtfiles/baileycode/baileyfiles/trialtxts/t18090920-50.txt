            . I am carter to Edward Dyson inn-keeper
 in the Old Change, Cheapside. On the 10th of July, I received a box at the King's Head in the Old Change, I did not know what it contained till it was opened at Bow street, the same day it was stolen out of my cart, and then I saw it contained cups, saucers, coffee cups, and plates. About the middle of the day I left my cart about four doors from Somerset-house


, the box was in the cart when I left it. It was directed to Mr. Brett, Esq. Berkley Square; I apprehended the prisoner about an hundred yards from the cart with the box on his shoulder.

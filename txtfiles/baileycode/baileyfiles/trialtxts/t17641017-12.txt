            . I was employed to hold the plate for the poor, at the Portuguese-chapel




; the prisoner went into the chapel about 11 o'clock: this was on the 7th of this instant: he went up the gallery stairs, and came out again. When all the people were come out, I went in with the money; he passed by me, and in a minute, I missed my hat. After that, I happened to come down Mount street, and met the prisoner on horseback; I charged him with taking my hat, and he denied it, but I found it upon him; when before Justice Welch, he owned to the taking of it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was in liquor, and went up the stairs, and coming down, there was nobody but an old woman; the hat was down on the outside of the steps. I carried it home to my father, and asked him what I must do with it. I thought to bring it to church again in the afternoon, but seeing the young man with a hat on, I did not give it him, thinking it was not his.

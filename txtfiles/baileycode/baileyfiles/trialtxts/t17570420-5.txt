                  Burton 
               



            . The prisoner does labouring business: I employed him one day in my barge, and was informed the next day, that 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Smith 
               



            , my servant
, had lost a pair of shoes, which cost him five shillings and six-pence. They charged the prisoner with taking them. He swore he'd send him and another of my servants to gaol for taking his character away, I took the prisoner up, and charged him with stealing the shoes. He at first denied taking them. Then he told me he would let me have them if I would let him go; I promised him I'd be favourable. Then he went and took them from a place where he had hid them, so I went to give him a mug of ale for his honesty, and he took an opportunity, while I was stooping, to shove me on my face and get out at the door; I went after him, and took him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was very much in liquor, and did not know what, or did.
Q. to Burton. Was he in liquor?
Burton. He was not at all in liquor.

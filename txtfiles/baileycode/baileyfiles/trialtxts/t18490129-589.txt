RALPH FIELD THOMAS
 (Thames-policeman, 18). On 17th Jan., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in a boat on the Thames, near Waterloobridge—I saw the prisoner and another man rowing in a boat towards the craft of Coles Child and others, coal-merchants—I knew the prisoner, and I asked him if he had seen a skiff—he said he had not—I described it, and said it belonged to Mr. Pugh—he said, "All right; if I see it I will tell you"—I then went to the other end of the tier of coal-barges, and saw the prisoner and the other man taking large pieces of coal out of the craft, and patting them into their boat—they rowed off—I pursued them—the prisoner got over the craft, and went towards Scotland-yard—I never lost sight of him—he was taken in Scotland-yard—I took him back to the boat, and found in it 840lbs. of coals, of the same sort as those in the barges.





JOHN WILLIAM SOMMERS RAE
 (Thames-policeman, 2), I saw two men running down towards Messrs. Coles Child's barges—my brother officer took another boat, and rowed alongside—he afterwards put me in possession of the boat in which these parties had been.

Prisoner. This man was not in the boat at all. Witness. Yes I was, at first





EDWARD ROWTON
. I am in the service of Coles Child and others. The Eliza, and Two Brothers, coal-barges, are their property—the prisoner had no business in them.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to try to get a barge to take across, and I heard a cry of "Stop thief?" this man took me, and said I was in the boat.





WILLIAM THOMAS BRIDGES
 (Thames police-inspector). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted April, 1848, confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Common Serjeant.

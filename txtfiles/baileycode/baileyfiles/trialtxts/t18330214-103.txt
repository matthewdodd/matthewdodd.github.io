            . I am a green grocer

, and live in King-street Cloth-fair



. I bought a sack of potatoes at the water side, I saw them on the morning of the 2nd of February, I was getting coke out of the cellar; my wife and daughter called me up and gave me information in the evening - I went after the prisoners, and caught sight of them about a dozen yards from our door; the sack of potatoes was dropped in the back yard of my premises - the prisoners were strangers to me.
Hart. Q. Was I not in liquor? A. Not in the least, for it took six of us to take him to the Compter; this is the sack the potatoes were in; I took Hart in charge, as I am a constable.


                  HANNAH 
                  STEVENS
               



            . I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. I did not know the prisoners until the 2nd of February, between five and six in the afternoon, when, I was coming down stairs, I saw them both in the passage - I asked them what they were doing; one of them said that as they were passing, the sack of potatoes had fallen, and they were lifting it up; I saw Kirkham lift the sack on Hart's back, and as they got to the yard I and my mother stopped them - they were just stepping outside the door; I fetched my father, and Lawrence came with him; they were secured.
Hart. Q. Were the potatoes in the yard or in the passage? A. In the passage; I saw them on Hart's back - he was just stepping into the yard; they could get into Cloth-fair from the yard.


                  WILLIAM 
                  LAWRENCE
               



            . I am servant to 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Pegg
               



            . I stopped the prisoner Hart in the passage; he had nothing with him then - I saw the sack of potatoes in the passage near him; he was charged with stealing it, and he said he was only cracking nuts, and he would not go with us unless we handcuffed him - we had no handcuffs; he swore we should not take him, and called me all manner of names; we got him down, and he said if he was not enough he would get a dozen more for us; Kirkham had got away somewhere.



                  GEORGE

            . I am a constable. I apprehended Kirkham on Wednesday, the 3rd of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I fetched the parties who charged him with being with Hart who took the potatoes; he said nothing to it then.
Hart's Defence. I once fell from a mast-head, and if I get a drop it effects my head. Kirkham was not with me - the prosecutor will buy any stolen property from children.
Kirkham's Defence. The statement is false. I was in company with a person from five until seven o'clock that evening, but he is not able to come.

            . Q. Were the potatoes in the passage or yard? A. Before they were taken they stood in the yard, three or four yards from the yard door - after the alarm the sack's mouth laid on the threshold of the door, having been dropped.


                  HANNAH 
                  STEVENS
               



            . I saw Kirkham lift it on Hart's back in the passage - my mother stopped him with it on his shoulder.


                  WILLIAM 
                  LAWRENCE
               



            . I and my master secured Hart; he resisted very much and kicked me in the eye; he nearly kicked my eye out - we had to tie his hands and feet and then carry him, he did not appear at all in liquor till he got to the Compter and then he did not speak or any thing.

             were again 


               indicted for stealing, on the 2nd of February

                  CRAWLEY
               



            . I keep the Queen's Head Public-house Duke-street near Smithfield. I saw the prisoners at my house on the 2nd of February, between two and three o'clock, in company; they had something to drink, and left without paying the reckoning - they left a parcel at the bar, and I detained it for the reckoning, as they had tendered me a had five shilling-piece in payment; they left my house to fetch the money to pay me; next day Kirkham returned, and I told him I thought the property left in my possession was not all right, and I would not give it up till I knew whether it was rightly come by; he said he got it in Mare-street Hackney - I sent for a Policeman and gave him in charge, having heard that Hart was taken; the parcel was claimed on the Monday, by Smith's young man - I had seen Kirkham at my house several times; he always conducted himself well - Kirkham placed the parcel on the bar while he went to get some refreshment; I cannot say which tendered the bad money, us my servant received it - Hart received it back from me; it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - as he went out he seemed half tipsy and used very bad language.


                  BENJAMIN 
                  FURNLEY
               



            . I am apprentice to Valentine Smith, of Alderagate-street, tea dealer and grocer



. I saw a parcel at Crawley's house; It belonged to my master - it was 6lbs. 1os of tea; I had packed it up about half-past three o'clock, and placed it on the fourth counter from the door, I left my master in care of the shop; I came into the shop again in about twenty minutes and it was gone; it was to go to our other shop at the west end of the town - I was quite certain of it when I saw it again.
GEORGE COOK. I am a constable. I apprehended Kirkham at Crawley's - the pracel of tea was there; I asked how he came by it: he said he had it from Mr. Summers, a carpenter, in Mare-street, Hackney - that he had it as part of a debt of 5s. for making a pair of trousers; I asked him his name, and he gave me the name of Kay - I went to Mare-street, but could find no Summers there; on Monday morning I took Furnley to Mr. Crawley's, and he claimed the tea.


                  BENJAMIN 
                  FURNLEY
               



            . I can say this is the parcel I packed, for as I was tying it, one of the threads of the string broke, which I see here plainly - it was not entirely broken, but cracked - it corresponds in weight with the parcel I made up: I have no doubt of it.
Kirkham's Defence. I had it from a man who did some work for - I met him, and he said, "I cannot pay you money, but if you will take this tea, I will call and settle with you in about a fortnight;" if he gave me a false address, that is not my fault.

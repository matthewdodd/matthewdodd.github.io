WILLIAM COTTLE
. I am a policeman. On the 30th of January, at a quarter before two o'clock in the morning, I was in Lant-street, Borough, and saw the prisoner carrying something—he popped round the corner—I said to him, "What have you here?"—he said, "My tools"—I said, "What are you?"—he said, "Abricklayer"—I said, "A bricklayer does not use carpenter's tools"—he said, "Well, it is all right"—I said, "I do not know that, I shall take you to the station-house"—as I took him there he said, "Well, I have had nothing to do for two or three months—I shall have something to do now"—he was three-quarters of a mile from the building they were taken from.






JOSEPH DOWDEN
. I am a carpenter. Some of these tools are mine—I left them in an unfinished house in Tooley-street—I know nothing of the prisoner.





RICHARD LEDGER
. I worked at the building—this mortice gauge is mine.





RICHARD OCKERFORD
. I lost thete planes from the same building.

Prisoner's Defence. I was hired to carry them by a man in the Borough, who had a large basket full of them—I was to meet him at the Bricklayer's Arms—I did not know where they came from.

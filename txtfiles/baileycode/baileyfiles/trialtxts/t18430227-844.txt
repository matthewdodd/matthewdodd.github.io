MARY CROFT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of Feb., 51 yards of carpet, value 18s., the goods of 




George Taylor; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE NIGHTINGALE
 (City police-constable, No. 633.) On the morning of the 15th of Feb., I was on duty at the corner of Spital-square, Bishops-gate, and the prisoner passed me with a large bundle wrapped in a shawl—about 150 yards from the prosecutor's I stopped her, and asked what she had there—she made no answer—I pulled her shawl on one side, and saw it was a roll of new carpet—I asked where she had it from—she said from Shoreditch—I asked who it belonged to—she said it was hers—I took her to the prosecutor's shop, and he claimed it—I had received information of the loss about a quarter of an hour before.





GEORGE TAYLOR
. I am a linendraper, and live in Bishopsgate-street-without. I saw my carpet safe at my door about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and missed it a little after eleven—in consequence of information from a female, I ran up the street, but could see nobody—I told the policeman, and he shortly after brought the prisoner back, with the carpet—this now produced is it—I have no private mark on it, but just before it was taken I had noticed this yellow tuft on it—it was ticketed at 4 1/2 d. a yard.





ROBERT WHITTLETON
 (police-constable K 152.) I produce a certificate of

the prisoner's former conviction—I am certain she is the same person—I was present at her trial—(read.)

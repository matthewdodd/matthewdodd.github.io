EDWARD TAPP

On the 10th of November, the prisoner came to our house for some black and coloured sarcenet ribbon for Mr. Quick, of New-street, Corset-square, who dealt with us—I allowed him to select the goods, and take them—he had fifty-four yards of black Saracen ribbon I furnished him with, in consequence of his representing that he came from Mr. Quick.





CHARLES QUICK

Prisoner's Defence. I did it from sheer necessity—I had been our of a situation for a year.

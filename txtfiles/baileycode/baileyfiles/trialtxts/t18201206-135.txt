            . I am a solicitor
 of Furnival's-Inn. The prisoner had been my writing clerk
. On the 15th of November, I told him to carry two books to Mr. Winyard, in Nassau-street, and on the 5th of December, I discovered they were not delivered; I had discharged the prisoner before that. The books were found at Mr. Callow's. I have a book, in which deliveries are entered, I produce it - it is entered as delivered, in his writing.

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Princes-street, Soho. In November, the prisoner brought two books to sell; I gave him 7 s. for them - they are worth more.

             JEFFERSON. I am clerk to the prosecutor. When the prisoner returned, I asked him if he found out the place? he said he delivered them in Nassau-street.

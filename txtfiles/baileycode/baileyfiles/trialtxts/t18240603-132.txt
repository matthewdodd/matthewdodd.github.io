            . I live in Jermyn-street, St. James's. On the 22d of April I was servant to

            , who keeps a wine-vaults
 in High Holborn


. About twenty minutes to seven o'clock on that morning, I saw the prisoner in a box in the tap-room - she remained there till nearly ten, and then went into the yard, and then into the parlour; I had served her with a glass of rum; she went out in about twenty minutes, and I missed a lamp from the parlour ceiling. I had seen it safe several times that morning. The officer brought her back with it about five o'clock that afternoon.

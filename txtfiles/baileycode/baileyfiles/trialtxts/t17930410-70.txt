             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Bright, a master weaver in Chiswell-street. On the 1st of March, I was going by Mr. Faulding's shop, in Coventry-street


; it was between the hours of six and seven, I hears the fall of glass; it was about half an hour after six, it was dark; with that I turns about and sees a person stooping in this manner, and immediately snatched something from the window, it was a long piece they took out; I ran up in pursuit of the person, I saw a sudden snatch, it lays very low to the ground from the bottom pane of glass; I ran after the man, the man ran into the square, I don't know the name of the square; with that he ran against a gentlewoman, to whom I rather thought he gave the property, I ran after him, and I found there was no thoroughfare in the square, and as such I found him standing at a door as if he was going to knock at it; then when I found that he was secured in the square, I saw nobody else about, Mr. Faulding's servant came out and I said there is the man; but says I, where is the woman, the woman has got the property; Mr. Faulding's people secured the man; the property was thrown over an area, I did not see him throw it; I thought he gave it to the woman; I am sure he is the man, his hand was cut with the glass.
Mr. Knowlys. This was about half past six, on the month of March? - It was.
Court. Pray was there any body else at the window? - No, there was not.
Mr. Knowlys. You saw a man's face? - No, I did not, I saw a man stooping.
Q. You saw a man go into the square? - I did.
Q. You saw him go to the door? - I did, and stand as if he was going to knock.
Q. Did you see his face then? - No, I do not undertake to say I did.
Q. If any body had been coming by you then, supposing the lamps not being light, there was not light enough to distinguish the features of any man's face? - I was not so near him as that.
Q. Then there was day light enough to distinguish the features of any man's face if you was tolerably near him? - I cannot say there was.
Q. You cannot swear there was not day light enough? - I will not undertake to say.
Q. If any person for instance had come pretty near you at that time there would have been day light enough to have distinguished the features of his face? - The lights of the square was sufficient for that.
Q. I am talking of the day light that remained? - I don't think there was really.

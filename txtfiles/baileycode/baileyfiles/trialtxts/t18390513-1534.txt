MR. PHILLIPS
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM HARLEY
. I was a green-grocer, but have retired from business. I was in the habit of receiving the rents of small houses, which I let for the owners—the prisoner occupied No. 26, College-street, Homerton—on the 16th of April he owed me four weeks' rent—he came to my house about a quarter or twenty minutes after eight o'clock that evening—I let him in, and placed my candle on the counter—he said he was come to pay me some rent—I asked him for his book—he gave it to me—I asked him how much rent he was going to pay—he said three weeks,' which was 17s. 6d., and that he wanted change for a sovereign—I laid 2s. 6d. down on the counter—he did not take it up, but kept his hand in his pocket as I thought to pull out the sovereign—we stood opposite each other at the time, but he nestled round inside the counter, and was telling me a long tale about his labour, with Mr. Burgess, and what a little he had to support his family, and if I heard of anything better for him to let him know—he still kept his hand in his pocket, and then drew it out as I thought to lay down the sovereign—some piece of coin was no doubt under

his hand, but I could not get a glimpse of it, for before it was well down, his hand and handkerchief was up at my eyes and nose, he crammed it into my mouth, and broke out one of my teeth—I could not see, as the handkerchief was over my eyes, and partly down my mouth—I tried to call out, but could not get the least breath, or utter a word—by some means he fixed my arms, so that I could only get the use of my fingers—he still kept me in that position, my eyes blinded, and my mouth stopped—he took hold of my throat, and kept forcing me away from the counter, towards a back-kitchen, or wash-house, which is twelve feet from the counter on the same floor, but quite behind the house, away from the front-door—he got me eleven feet from where the attack began, against a door, which leads down to a kitchen below stairs—I had the presence of mind, being obliged to struggle for life, for I could not breathe, to kick against the kitchen-door, which leads down stairs, as I knew my niece was down there—I kicked against the door three times in my last struggle—he said, "It's no use, it's no use, if you make the least resistance or alarm, it shall be the worse for you"—he then griped my throat with more violence, so that I lost my breath and my senses—I lost all consciousness altogether—when I came to myself, I was lying with my hind-part in the wash-house, and my head in the shop, and the witnesses about me.

Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect calling at my house the morning before? A. I believe I did—I saw either your mother or wife, I really do not recollect which—I called for rent, and was told you would call on me—I was not sure you would come, for your wife had told me, a fortnight before, that you were coming—they told me you would come this evening to see me—I had had that answer, once or twice before—I did not state at Worship-street about my tooth being forced out, for I was hardly in my senses then, nor have I been perfectly clear ever since—I have been so hurt in my body inwardly, I have hardly been able to go out of the house—my mouth was so sore, my lips being cut so much, I hardly knew I missed my tooth at the moment—I swear you did not lay a sovereign down on the counter—I saw no sovereign—I never said I saw one—I said you attempted to lay down a sovereign, and it proved there was no sovereign to be found—I never said you laid one down.





ELEANOR PRECIOUS
. I am the prosecutor's niece. On the night of the 16th of April I was in the kitchen, and I heard a great scuffling in the shop, and afterwards three very loud kicks at the door, which aroused me—I opened the window, got into the area, and called "Murder"—two officers came to me—I told them they were murdering my uncle, and to break the door open, or he would be gone—they broke it open, and when they came into the house I went up stairs—I found them helping my uncle, who was in a state of insensibility, bleeding at his nose and mouth—I afterwards went to sit on a chair in the shop, and found a large hammer which did not belong to the shop—I had never seen it before—the prisoner was there at the time—I asked, in his presence, who owned it, but no one owned it—nobody had left the house—my uncle came to his senses at last, when they got him into the parlour—the prisoner was in the parlour—somebody asked my uncle what had happened—the prisoner stood before me—my uncle said, "Oh, that Jones," and then related what he had done to him—he said he had stopped his mouth with a handkerchief, and dragged him to the wash-house-door—the prisoner said, "Oh, Mr. Harlcy, don't accuse me of that, it is a serious charge"—he was taken into custody—the officer has

the hammer—I had seen the place where I found it about twenty minutes before, and there was no hammer there then.

Prisoner. Q. During the noise you heard, were the kicks against the door or on the floor? A. Against the door, and, I heard a strangling noise—I heard nobody call me—I heard my uncle say, you said you had brought a sovereign, and wished for change—I did not hear him say he saw it on the counter—when I came up stairs my uncle was a very few steps from the door—there were several persons with him—Mr. Etheridge had hold of him on one side—I cannot recollect who had hold of his other side—he was being led along, as if he could not walk—he was insensible.





GEORGE THOMAS ETHERIDGE
. I am a cabinet-maker and parish constable. On the 16th of April my attention was arrested by Precious—I went to Mr. Harley's house with Tomalin, my brother officer—I broke the door open—the shop was in darkness—a light was brought instantly, and I found Mr. Harley in the back part of the shop, near the kitchen, on the ground, and the prisoner leaning over him—there was a small laceration on his forehead, and his nose and mouth were bleeding likewise—he was not in his senses—I turned Jones round, and said, "What is all this?"—he said, "Mr. Harley is in a fit"—I said, "Let us get him up"—he assisted me to get him up—we got him up—a number of people came to his assistance—when he came to his senses he said, "It is that Jones," and shook his head—he was not sensible at the moment, but when he came to himself he said, in Jones's presence, what had happened to him—the prisoner said, "Mind what you say, Mr. Harley, this is a serious charge"—the prisoner was searched in my pretence, at his own request—I found no sovereign—I searched the shop carefully, and the counter, but found no sovereign—I found two shillings and a sixpence on the counter, and one shilling in the back kitchen.

Prisoner. Q. You state I was leaning over the prosecutor—what was I doing? A. In the act of lifting him up, you said, "Don't you know me?" I said, "Yes, I do"—you said, "My name is Jones"—I think I asked what was the matter, and you said Mr. Harley was in a fit—you assisted me in raising him from the ground—I think I was in the shop when the police-man examined the prosecutor's neck, which he did in the parlour, but am not positive, and do not know the result—the prosecutor walked from the spot where I first saw him—when he came into the shop he came to his senses—I did not state at Worship-street that he was carried in a state of insensibility.





JOSEPH TOMALIN
. I accompanied Etheridge to Mr. Harley's house—Etheridge broke the door open—I followed him in—I found the prosecutor lying on his back in the back kitchen adjoining the shop—his forehead was grazed, the skin off, and he was bleeding at the nose and mouth—I helped him up—the prisoner was standing in a stooping position when we went in—Etheridge said, "Halloo, what is all this about?"—the prisoner turned round, and said, "You know me—my name is Jones"—I said, "What is the matter with Mr. Harley?"—he said, "He has fallen down in a fit."

Prisoner, Q. Were you present when the policeman examined Mr. Harley's throat? A. Yes—I did not see any marks of violence on his throat—I heard Mr. Harley describe the way you used him—he said you forced your knuckles into his throat—I was not near enough to distinguish whether there were any marks—I stood in the shop—part of the examination was in the shop, and part in the back place—I cannot say how long the door continued open after it was forced open, I suppose some time—

nobody went out, to my knowledge—I cannot say whether every body who entered remained in the shop—I was by the door most of the time, and saw nobody go out—there was nothing to hinder any body from going out—there was some blood from the prosecutor's forehead, some from his nose, and some from his lips—I should rather say the mark on the forehead was from a fall—I heard him say you came on purpose to pay three weeks' rent, and he thought you were going to tender him a sovereign—he said you put down a piece of money of some description, he did not know what—he heard the money jink on the counter—he did not say it was a sovereign.





JOHN AYRES
. I am a policeman. My attention was attracted to Mr. Harley's house on the 16th of April, and J took the prisoner into custody—I saw a hammer after it was found, and have it here, also the rent-book, and a handkerchief, which I found on the prisoner—I found no sovereign at all—I examined the prosecutor's throat, but saw no marks of fingers on it.

Prisoner. Q. Were you present when he related what had happened? A. I was present when he began to make a statement—he said that you laid down a sovereign, but he afterwards said he supposed it was a sovereign—Etheridge said he found a shilling, and I believe that caused a suspicion that that was introduced for the sovereign—he appeared to have no doubt, when he first spoke, of its being a sovereign—there was a graze on his forehead, and his head and lips were bleeding—I saw no blood from his nose, but I do not know what might have been previous to my coming in—he was just being led into the parlour when I came in—there were no marks of blood on the handkerchief, that I know of—it is a red handkerchief.

MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Mr. Harley a cravat on his neck? A. It was pulled off just before I came in, whatever he had on—I have known the prisoner a length of time.





CHARLES HORTON PULLEY
. I am a solicitor—I know Mr. Grove, the Magistrate of Worship-street—I have seen him write repeatedly—this is his handwriting to this examination—(read)—the prisoner says, "I went to the prosecutor's house last night at a little after eight o'clock, to pay him some rent—I told him I wanted to pay 17s. 6d. for three weeks' rent; I told him to give me half-a-crown, which he put on the counter—I put a sovereign down—he then said, 'O my God!' and stumbled over the counter—I tried to catch him, but in so doing we both went down together—I kicked with my feet for assistance, and on doing so I heard the door burst open."

Prisoner's Defence. On the night in question I went to the prosecutor's house about a quarter before eight o'clock—the door was opened by the prosecutor, who desired me to walk in, and he shut the door after me—I told him I had come to pay three weeks' rent—he asked for the rent-book, which I gave him, and he entered the sum in it—I took a sovereign from my waistcoat pocket, and laid it on the counter—when he had done writing in the book he gave it me back—we then entered into conversation, which was by my requesting him, should he hear of a better situation than I had, to let me know—he said he would, if he heard of anything—I thanked him and said, "If you give me 2s. 6d. it will make it right"—he put his hand into his pocket, took out 3s. 6d., and laid 2s. 6d. on the counter—before I had time to take the money up I saw him raise one hand to the pit of his stomach and exclaim. "O my God!"—he seemed to stagger, as if about to fall—I moved to the end of the counter, and as he was falling caught him in my arms—his weight being too much for me we both fell together—I

was well aware his niece was living with him, and called to her, and at the same time stamped on the floor—this I did while I was wiping the spittle from his mouth, as he was foaming—I was raising him up, and at that time the candle went out, the door was burst open, and Etheridge ran up exclaiming, "What is the matter? who are you?"—I turned round and replied, "Why, it's me"—he said, "Who are you?"—I said, "Why, Jones, you know me very well"—he said, "Is that you, Jones? what is the matter?"—I said, "Why, Mr. Harley is in a fit"—the witness took hold of one arm, while I did the other—the prosecutor being raised on his legs, looked wildly round for some seconds—there were not less than twenty or thirty people in the shop—he walked into the side-parlour with assistance—he was not carried in in a state of insensibility—we seated him in a chair, and after the lapse of about ten minutes, to my surprise he accused me of having ill-treated him—among those who came into the shop was the, policeman, who took me into custody—I requested him, in presence of several in the shop, to examine the prosecutor's neck, which he did, but could not perceive the least mark or sign of violence—had I used the force by driving my knuckles into his throat, as he stated, surely some marks would have been left, but there were none—one of the persons in the shop said,"Here is half-a-crown on the counter," and Mr. Newell, who was present, inquired of the prosecutor what had become of the sovereign which he had stated in the presence of several I had laid down on the counter—he replied he had not got the sovereign—he searched his pockets, but could not find any sovereign—a general search was made by a dozen persons in and about the shop, but the sovereign was not to be found—now, full twenty minutes had elapsed before this search, during which time the shop had been full of persons going in and out, any one of whom might easily have taken the sovereign—somebody present insinuated that perhaps I had taken the sovereign up again—I requested the policeman to search me—he said if I wished it he would—he did so, assisted by another policeman who had arrived, but they found no money on me, the sovereign in question being the only coin I had left home with, and that was brought to pay my rent—the prosecutor had called at my house on Monday morning for the rent, and my wife had told him I would call on Tuesday evening and pay him—he was well aware I was coming—the graze on the forehead I can only account for by the fall, but the blood from his lips was occasioned by his biting them, when on the ground—I deny any blood coming from his nose—they also state he was carried in a state of insensibility from where they first saw him to the little room—this is wrong—he walked merely by the assistance of myself and Etheridge, having hold of an arm each—as to the hammer, I solemnly declare I know nothing whatever about it—it does not belong to me, and never was in my possession—had it belonged to me I had the opportunity of putting it away, as I was not given in charge for at least a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, during which time the door remained open for anybody to enter or go out—I could have gone away entirely if inclined, but relying on my innocence I certainly rendered all die assistance I could to the prosecutor—I solemnly declare I never used the least violence to him—I am utterly at a loss to account for his statement to-day, which is untrue.





WILLIAM HARLEY

re-examined. I have never been subject to apoplectic or epileptic fits—I had two handkerchiefs on my neck, a calico one and

a black silk one over it—he got hold of the handkerchiefs and squeezed them up together with my throat.

Q. Then he did not put his knuckles to your neck? A. He just got them inside once, but then got them out, and drew the handkerchiefs together—my neck was never examined—I never had the handkerchiefs pulled off at all to examine my neck—they were not pulled down at all to examine it—the policeman did not examine my neck.





GEORGE T. ETHERIDGE

re-examined. I did not see the prosecutor's neckcloth taken off, nor see his neck examined—it was not taken off in my presence.





JOHN AYRES

re-examined. I did not see his neck handkerchief taken off—I took the candle, and his collar was pulled down—Mr. Harley might not recollect it at the moment, he being so frightened and alarmed, but I certainly did examine it, and that by the request of the prisoner.





ELEANOR PRECIOUS

re-examined. My uncle was never subject to fits—I never knew him have one.

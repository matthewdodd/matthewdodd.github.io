            . I am shopman to Mr. Eagles Johnson, who lives in Oxford-street


. On the 18th of April, in consequence of information which I received, I run out, and took the prisoner in Henrietta-street, and found sixteen yards of cotton on her. I had not seen her in or about the shop at all-it was Mr. Johnson's property. I had seen it safe about two hours before - She had got it wrapped up in her apron, under her child's legs-it was taken out of the window-there was another man and a boy in the shop beside me - I told her she must go back with me - She said distress had driven her to it-it could have been taken out of the shop by putting her arms in - A lady described the prisoner to me - I gave her into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

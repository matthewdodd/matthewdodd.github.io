. On the 31st of August, I was told a woman went out with some things in her apron; I looked and missed the things mentioned: I pursued, and overtook her in St. John's-street, at a Cook's shop: I found my things in her apron; she said, if I would make no noise, she should go back with me: a person took hold of her, and he and I brought her back to my room; then she threw them down on my table. (Produced and deposed to.)
Mr. Nicholls. I heard the cry, Stop thief; I went and overtook her, and Mrs. James and I brought her back: she had the things in her apron.
Prisoner's Defence.
I do not know what to say; I never did such a thing in my life before.
She called two women to her character, who said, they never heard any ill of her before this.

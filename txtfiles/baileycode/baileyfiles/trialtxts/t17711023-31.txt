            . I am a watchman. On the 7th of October, about five in the morning, while I was crying the hour, I saw the prisoner loaded; I stopt him, and said you have got some lead; he said it was the first time and desired I would not hurt him. I took him into custody; I took the lead to the house at Brompton, and it matched the place the lead was taken from.

I found the lead at the back of the house.

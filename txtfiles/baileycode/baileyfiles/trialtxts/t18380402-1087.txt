ISABELLA COSTIN
. I am the wife of Philip Costin, a tobacconist, is Agar-street, Strand. On the 5th of April I was in the room behind the shop, and saw the prisoner in the shop, kneeling in a chair, he leant over the counter, and reached a bundle of cigars out of the window—he got off the chair, and dropped them on the side of the counter—I went and stopped him from going out, by getting between him and the door—I asked him what he was doing with the cigars—he said he was doing nothing—he was very much confused, and asked me for a pennyworth of tobacco—two gentlemen were in my parlour—they came out—one held him while the other went for a policeman—he denied knowing any thing about the cigars.

Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop, and asked for a pennyworth of tobacco—the lady was in the room, with two gentlemen—one gentleman came and collared me, till the policeman was fetched.

            . The prisoner is my apprentice
: she is in the 17th year of her age: I lost the things laid in the indictment; (mentioning them by name) at different times; I keep a public-house
: she had thrown a parcel of pewter pots down the bog-house, and had his some in the garret; this we supposed she did, in order not to have the scouring of them; and when we were about to chastise her for it, she then told us what she had taken before, and mentioned the taking a copper teakettle, by the instigation of an old woman; named Aspinell, who sold grey-peas about, and is mother to a woman that used to chare at our house; I really believe they drew her into this of taking the things away.

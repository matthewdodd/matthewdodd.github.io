             sworn.
The prisoner was servant
 to my master; she has lived with him about a fortnight; on Wednesday fortnight, about half after four, the prisoner came down stairs to me into the shop; she desired me to go down stairs to get her some beer; I made belief to go, but came up immediately, as I had a suspicion of her, she used to spend such a deal of money; I stopped at the corner to watch, and saw her take a pair of shoes off the shelf, and put them into her pocket; I took no notice of it; and she asked me whether I had the beer; and I said, yes; and then she said, she should go and clean herself, and when she came back, I might go down and warm my hands if I was cold; I staid in the shop till my master came home, and then I told him.

            . When the boy informed me, I took her into the kitchen and searched her, and found nothing; I sent for a constable; and she acknowledged stealing the things in the indictment; which the constable found at a pawnbroker's on Snow-hill.

I am a pawnbroker on Snow-hill; I took a pair of shoes in pawn of the prisoner, on the 8th of October; the other two pair are pledged in her name, but I do not remember taking them.

                  Payne 
               



            . I am servant
 to 
               
                  William 
                  Willet 
               



            ; my box was in the room where I lie: last Friday morning, I missed five guineas out of it; it stood by my bed-side; I had left it locked on the Thursday morning.
Q. Was the lock forced?
Payne. The Bolt was put back some how.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
Payne. He was at work by himself on the out-side of the house; on Thursday afternoon, cutting down leaden spouts, by the Commissioners order, that are paving the Strand: he went thro' my room to go on the out-side of the house; that made me suspect him. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and advised with him what to do; he granted a warrant; I took the prisoner up, and carried him before Sir John; he denied it there; he was searched, and half a guinea found upon him. Sir John granted me a search-warrant. Going back, he owned the fact, and delivered me three guineas and a half, which was at a woman's house he called sister. I never got my other guinea and half; he said he had bought a stock and bits, and a saw, with the rest of the money.
Q. Did he own where he took the money from?
Payne. He owned he took it out of my box: he delivered up his tools in order to pay me, when I carried him to Sir John again; but Sir John said that could not be. He committed him to Newgate.


                  William 
                  Holding 
               



            . The warrant was brought to me, to take up the prisoner upon suspicion; I took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; Sir John ordered me to search him. I found upon him 10 s. 6 d. after that, he granted Mr. Payne a warrant to search his lodgings. As we were going in Long-acre, he told me the money was not at his lodgings; it was at his sister's: we went there, and out of his tool-box he took three guineas, and delivered it into my hand; the prosecutor was by at the time: we then took him back to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's again; but he not being in the way, we took him to the Round-house. He said he had laid some of the money out in tools, which tools he delivered up to me and the prosecutor, which cost 18 s.
Q. Did you hear him say any thing about opening the prosecutor's box?
Holding. No, I did not.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was a little in liquor: whether I took the money out of the box, or no, I cannot tell; there were several other people backwards and forwards all that day: I know the box was open.
Holding. The prisoner owned to me he was drunk over night.

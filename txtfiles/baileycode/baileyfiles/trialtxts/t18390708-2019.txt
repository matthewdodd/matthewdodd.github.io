JOHN MAYS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of July, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 




William Webster, Clerk, from his person.






REV. WILLIAM WEBSTER
. I am a clergyman of the Church of England. On the 6th of July I was walking in St. Paul's church yard with a friend—I felt some one at my pocket—I put my hand behind me, and at that moment my handkerchief was taken—I turned round and seized the prisoner—he denied taking it, but my friend saw it lying at his feet—he resisted exceedingly, and threw himself down in the kennel, tore my shirt and cravat, and threatened to bite me if I did not let him go, but I kept him till a policeman came.

Prisoner. He tore my coat, and of course I tore his shirt—two men were walking behind him, two or three yards from me. Witness. He was close behind me—nobody was so near as him.





REV. ROBERT SOUTH
. I was with Mr. Webster—I saw the handkerchief lying at the prisoner's heels on the ground—nobody was so near to him as the prisoner, and nobody could have done it but him—he was close behind him—he made considerable resistance.

Prisoner. Neither of them can swear I took the handkerchief—I passed two men who walked off as fast as they could. Witness. I took it up close to his heels—there were two men about two yards behind him, who, I think, walked up the court where Mr. Webster took the prisoner—they had not walked over the spot where I found the handkerchief.





GEORGE VENTOM
 (City police-constable, No. 249.) I took charge of the prisoner, and received the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along—two men were behind the gentleman—I passed them when they were about a yard and a half behind

Mr. Webster—afterwards Mr. Webster got hold of me—they saw the handkerchief by the feet of the other two, about two yards from me—they went down the court, and he pulled me down there.

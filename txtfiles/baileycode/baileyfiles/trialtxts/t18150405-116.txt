WILLIAM FISH COLLINS. I am servant to Mr. Dancer, he is a butcher. On the night of the 26th of March, I and Plank, were sitting up all night to watch; I heard a noise among Mr. Neale's pigs; I went near the pig-stye, I found

                  Moore

             with him, he said he had; he threw the sack down, and run away, I fired at him, and shot one of his fingers: I went to Plank, we looked after Gold, we found him getting over Mr. Dancer's gate, he fell down. I and Plank seized him, and took him to the watchhouse.

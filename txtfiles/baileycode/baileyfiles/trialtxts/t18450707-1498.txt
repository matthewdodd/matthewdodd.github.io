WILLIAM JOSBFH HOLMAN
. I am a coal-merchant, and live at Phœnixwharf, Wapping. I know Jones by sight—I lost the articles stated, some of them are here, and are part of what I missed.





SARAH LITTLE
. I do not know Jones, only he brought these things to our house on the 9th of June—he wanted to leave them, and I would not let him.





ELIZABETH HAY
. I am an inmate of St. George's workhouse—Welsh occupies a room in the workhouse—I light the fires there. On the 18th of June I looked up the chimney in her room, and found a bundle—I called my master, and we pulled down the bundle—it contained these four shirts and other things.





EDWIN STORES
. I am master of the workhouse—Hay called me, anct t found these things—I informed the officer, and next morning Welsh's bed was opened, and the scarf was found in it—no one had access to her room or the bed, but Hay and Welsh—I had seen Jones and Welsh once together in the street, but they were tipsy.





WILLIAM BREACH
 (police-constable K 107.) After Welsh was committed from the Thames-police, when I passed by the cell, Jones said to her, "Why the d—I did you not make off with the things, and not keep them so long?"

WELSH—

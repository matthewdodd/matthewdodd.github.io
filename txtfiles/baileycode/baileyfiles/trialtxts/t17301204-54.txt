, the 23d of November
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prisoner (a young Girl
 about 10 Years of Age) liv'd with her Mother, in a Cellar, belonging to the Prosecutor's House, and that the Prosecutor being abroad, she took the Opportunity to take the Goods, which were stopp'd, she going to pawn them; the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d. As to the Bank Notes, upon Examination, she own'd, that she had burnt them; but the Evidence of the Prosecutor not answering to the Indictment, as to the Notes, she was acquitted of that part of the Indictment
            .

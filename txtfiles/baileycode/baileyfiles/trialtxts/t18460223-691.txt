THOMAS COX
 was indicted

 for stealing 11lbs., weight of iron, value 2s., the goods of 



Robert Cox; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN ALLEN
. I am in the employ of Mr. Robert Cox, who is building a school in Lower North-street, Chelsea. I had some iron of his there—about six o'clock in the evening, on the 9th of Feb., I left it safe in the back school-room—I came next morning and it was gone—this is it—I am quite sure this is the iron I lost—a person must have got in at a window five feet high to get it.





PETER HACK
 (police-constable B 75.) I was on the look out on the evening of the 9th of Feb.—I met the prisoner running down North-street with this bar of iron—I stopped him, took him to the station, and asked him where he got it—he said he did not know, and he did not know where he was going to take it.





AMOS BOWDLER
. On the evening of the 9th of Feb., I saw the prisoner and three others near the place where this iron was taken from—I watched them from half-past five o'clock till half-past seven—I drove them away—

they still stood about—the prisoner went to the front door and shoved it—he went to the back window—I ran to lock my door, and before I turned my key the prisoner ran across the street, and the officer took him.





EDWARD SYMES
 (police-constable D 182.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 3rd April, 1849, having been before convicted, confined three months and whipped)—the prisoner is the boy—he associates with bad characters.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ELLEN BARRATT.
 I am the wife of Thomas Barratt, of Blackfriar's-road. About six o'clock, on 12th May, we were crossing Blackfriar's-bridge—I felt a pressure, and saw the prisoner throw my purse over the balustrades of the bridge—I believe it had 3s. or 4s. in it—this is it—(produced.)

Prisoner. You said at Guildhall you never saw me take it; a woman said she saw me take it, and then you said you saw me chuck it over. Witness. A lady told me I had been robbed.






THOMAS BARRATT.
 I am a stationer in Blackfriar's-road. I was going over the bridge, a lady said my wife had been robbed, and pointed out the prisoner—I seized him—he threw the purse over the bridge—I knew it well—I am sure it was hers.





EDWARD JONES
 (City policeman, 330.) On Saturday morning, 13th April, I made a search by the of the bridge—I found this purse on the sand, about the center of the last arch—here are three rings and a tassel on it.




GUILTY.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

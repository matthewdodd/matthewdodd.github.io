JOSEPH JACKSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 38 1/2 lbs. weight of bacon, value 1l. 10s.; the goods of 



Edmond Ronalds; having been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE NICOLL
 (policeman.) On Thursday, the 19th of Aug.; I saw the prisoner and another person in Rosemary-lane—the prisoner was carrying a

bag, which appeared to have something in it—when they saw me and another constable, they turned and went down a turning on the left—I went after them—the other man got away—I caught the prisoner, and asked him what he had got—he said it was bacon he had got from a barge at St. Katharine's. stairs—I took him to the station.





JOSEPH DOCKERILL.
 I am warehouseman to Mr. Edmund Ronalds, prvision-merchant, of Upper Thames-street—the windows at the back of the house, by the water side, are secured with iron bars—I remember the prisoner coming to the house, and in consequence of what he said I examined the stock, and missed some bacon—this produced is of the same description—it is part of some that was shipped at the same time—the mark and the texture of the bag are the same—there is no brand on the bacon—I cannot swear it is the same—we missed from our stock seven rolls of bacon, two only were found, they were cut in halves—there is no doubt about the bacon having been taken out of the window, from the state we found the window in.

Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of taking it; I went down to St. Katharine's-stairs, saw the barge lying there, and the bacon in it; I went and took them away; I thought they were of no use.





JOSEPH SHAM
 (Thames policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 23rd of Nov., 1846, and confined six months)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person




GUILTY. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

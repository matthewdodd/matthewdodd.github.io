Q. Had you ever seen them before? -

            Not to my knowledge; they passed us several times so close as to brush our clothes as they passed, the prisoner was one of them.
Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes; I communicated to my sister a suspicion of one of these boys, when one of them stopped at my side, under pretence of buckling his shoe; the prisoner at the bar immediately snatched at my bundle, which I had on my arm; I held it tight; he made a second attempt immediately, and got it from me; he ran down Hampshire-hog-yard, with one of the others.
Q. You had never seen the prisoner before? - A. No.

Q. Have you even seen the bundle since? - A. No.
Q. Are you sure he was one of them? - A. Yes, but he was not in the same dress that he is now, he was dressed more like a working person.

GEORGE GRIMES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of April, 1 pistol, value 5s., the goods of 



Richard Francis Webb; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES TUCKER
. I am in the service of Richard Francis Webb, a ship-chandler, in King-street, Tower-hill. On the morning of the 14th of April, I was putting away the shutters—the prisoner came into the shop and took a pistol off the counter—he put it into the breast of his coat, and ran down King-street—I pursued him into a water-closet at the corner of White Horse-court, Rosemary-lane—we brought him out—he said, "Don't say anything"—I have never seen the pistol since—I had not known him before—I charged him with stealing the pistol—he said he had nothing about him—I only lost sight of him while I was getting out of the shop.





JOSEPH POTTER
. On that Wednesday morning, I heard footsteps in the passage at the corner of White Horse-court—I went to the water-closet and saw the prisoner—I told him to come out—he told me to hold my row.






WILLIAM GUISE
. I am a waterman. I was in a shop opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, take a pistol out, and put it under his coat—I gave information.





JOHN SHEARER
 (police-constable H 184.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

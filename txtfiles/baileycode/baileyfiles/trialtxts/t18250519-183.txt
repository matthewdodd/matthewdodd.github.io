                  , from his person
            .
JAMES RITCHIE. I am a clerk
. On the 2d of May, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street


. I am not certain whether I had a handkerchief in my pocket, but one was shewn me by the officer, which I know to be mine - it has my initials on it - I did not feel any one take it, but heard some one call out, and saw the officer take it from Norman - the other prisoner was not a yard from him - they were taken into custody - I had seen my handkerchief an hour before.

            . I saw the two prisoners follow this gentleman and another - I saw them go behind Mr. Ritchie, and Turner took the handkerchief, and put it between them - Norman then took it from him and put it under his small clothes; I took hold of them and Norman fell down with it in his trowsers.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
TURNER'S Defence. As I was going along Fleet-street, I saw Norman before me, he stooped and picked up something, turned round and asked me if this was my handkerchief - I said no, and then the officer came and took us.

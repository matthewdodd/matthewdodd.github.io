            . I am a salesman
, and live in the Minories


. On the 7th of October I was called from dinner, and found the prisoner handling a coat on a clothes-horse inside the shop - he went towards the door. Supposing him a customer I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him what he wanted? I brought him into the middle of the shop, my young man charged him with having a waistcoat under his jacket - it was found on him. I asked him why he took it? he said it was pretty, and he thought he should like it. He had left the shop without my knowing he had it. I spoke English to him, he understood me perfectly well.

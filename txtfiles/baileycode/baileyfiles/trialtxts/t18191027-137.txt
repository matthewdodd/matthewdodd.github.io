            . I am an officer. On the 16th of October, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was going over Friar's-mount, and met the prisoner with the pump on his shoulders, in company with another young chap. As soon as the other saw me he ran away. I caught hold of the prisoner with the pump; he said he found it in Crabtree-row, which is close to the prosecutor's.

ANN BROOKS
. I am servant to Mr. Christopher Dunkin Francis. This handkerchief is like his, and it is marked with his name—to the best of my belief it is his—he is now at Oxford.





THOMAS HOBBS
. I am a policeman. I was at Greenwich fair on the 20th of April. About five or six o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners in company, standingclose behind Mr. Francis—I saw Chapman put his hand into his pocket, and take out this handkerchief; he was in the act of handing it to Creasy—I took them both into custody—the prosecutor followed me to the station—he stated before the Magistrate that his name was Christopher Dunkin Francis.

Chapman. We picked it up. Witness. I saw him take it out, and I had watched them sounding pockets for half an hour before.
(Mary Grace, of Harp-alley, gave Chapman a good character.)

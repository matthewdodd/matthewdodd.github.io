 for stealing, on the

JEREMIAH GALLAHER
. I manage the business of my mother, Ellen Gillaher, of Rosemary-lane—Buckley lives opposite us—on the 4th of March he came and told me something—I went after the prisoner, and collared him—the policeman came and took him—the shoes fell from him—he was walking quite gently—these are my mother's shoes—they were safe a quarter of an hour before.





JOHN BUCKLEY
. I saw the prisoner walk by my window, and look at my shoes—he crossed suddenly to the other side—I went to my door, and saw him take a pair of shoes from the prosecutor's window.





PIERCE DRISCOLL
 (police-sergeant H 24.) I seised the prisoner—he dropped these shoes at my feet.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking through Rosemary-lane, and this accused me; these shoes were dropped, but I never dropped them.





THOMAS KAY
 (police-constable H 101.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person that was tried.




GUILTY

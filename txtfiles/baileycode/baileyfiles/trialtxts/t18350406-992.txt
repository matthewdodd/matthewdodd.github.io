BRIDGET RYAN
. I am the wife of Thomas Ryan; we live in Sand-yard, Clerkenwell. I knew the prisoner for about three weeks—he had removed my furniture, and I gave him a few nights' lodging—he left me a week before this happened—on the 16th of March, I went out at eight o'clock in the evening—I left my box locked, but not the room door—I returned before eleven o'clock, and my box had been broken open, and a smallbox, which had been in the large one, was gone, and all the property stated—the box was quite empty—I went to the station-house, and saw the prisoner and the property—this is my little box—I have the key of it—these things are all my property.





JOHN MURPHY
 (police-sergeant G 215.) I saw the prisoner in Ray-street—he had a bundle—I followed him, and he went into the White Swan—I stopped him, and asked what he had got, and whether it was his own—he said it was—I asked him what he was—he said what was that to we—I asked him to let me see what he had—he refused—I took him to the station, and found this property—he then said they belonged to his wife, and he lived at No. 3, Peter-street—I went there, and found no such person was known.





GEORGE FINDLAY
 (police-sergeant G 4.) I went to the public-house afterwards, and found this little box there.

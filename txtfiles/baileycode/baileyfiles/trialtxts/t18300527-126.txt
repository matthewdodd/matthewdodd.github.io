 - the prisoner lodged with me for a fortnight and two days. On the 26th of April she was going out, and I asked her for my dirty sheets, as I had not had them, when I gave her the clean ones - I had asked her for them that morning, and she said I should have them bye-and-bye; I heard her come down softly, I made her go up again till she had fetched them; I then went up, and missed the property.

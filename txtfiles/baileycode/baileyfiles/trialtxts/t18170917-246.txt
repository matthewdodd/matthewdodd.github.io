            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Marylebone. On the 28th of August, when I came home I found the coat had been cut down, I hung it up and in about a quarter of an hour I saw it fall down again, I went over the way and watched, and saw several young men come up-it hung inside the shop, the prisoner came up held his apron up and let it fall in - He ran off. I secured him. I never lost sight of him.

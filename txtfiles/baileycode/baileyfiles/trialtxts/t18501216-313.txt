CHARLES CONNELL



, stealing 1 coat, value 1l.; the goods of 



William Pavey; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM PAVEY
. I live at 54, Kennington-lane. On 12th Dec., at about half-past twelve o'clock, in consequence of something that was said to me, I went into my shop, and missed a great coat, which I had put there about two hours before—I went into the street, and saw the prisoner about fifty yards off, with the coat on his arm—I came up to him, and said, "You have an article there which don't belong to you," and as I was going to catch hold of him, he threw the coat on my arm, and ran away as fast as he could—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief!" and a policeman came up and caught him—I did not lose sight of him—this is the coat (produced).

Cross-examined by
MR. M'MAHON. Q. Did he not say he did it through

starvation? A. Yes; I only lost sight of him as he was turning the corners—I saw another man about two yards from him—I did not see that man afterwards.





ROBERT DAVIS
 (policeman, L 102). I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" saw the prisoner running, ran after him, and took him—I heard him tell the prosecutor that he did it through starvation, and he hoped he would be lenient with him.





JOHN HARVEY
. I was a policeman last March. I produce a certificate—(read—Surrey Sessions, George Wilson, convicted, March 1850, confined three months and whipped)—I was present; the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.** Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

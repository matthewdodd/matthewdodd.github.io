            , in Finsbury-square


. On the 4th of November, at half-past eight o'clock at night, I heard a noise at the door - I went up, and found the prisoner laying in the hall, with his head under a chair; I took him - he had his shoes in one hand, and these six spoons in the other; two of them are plated and four silver - they are my master's, and had been in a little room, up two pairs of stairs from the hall; they had been safe an hour before - it is supposed he got in by a back way, from Wilson-street, which is left open till five o'clock in the evening.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner.
Prisoner. It is impossible for them to swear to the spoons, when they have been through four or five hands -I never had them in my possession - they were on a table in the hall.

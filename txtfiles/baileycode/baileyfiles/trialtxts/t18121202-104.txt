            . I am a coach-maker
, Upper Berkley-street, Portman-square


. On the 3d of November I detected the prisoner taking this coach-glass out of a coach in my shop. This coach was exactly in the middle of the shop; it was the distance of three carriages from the door. He had got the glass from the carriage before I got to him. He left it in the bottom of the body when he saw me. I seized him. This glass is worth thirty shillings. It would cost more to replace it. When the constable searched him the string that pulled up the glass was found in his hat.
Prisoner's Defence. What he says is all perfectly right.

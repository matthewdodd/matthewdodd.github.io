. On the 27th of April, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was at the back of my shop, and saw the prisoner put his hand through a broken pane of glass, which I had secured with paper - he took a rule out. The glass was safe half an hour before. I went out and seized him with his arm in the window - he had taken the rule off the nail.

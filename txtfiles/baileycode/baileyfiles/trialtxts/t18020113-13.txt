WILLIAM BRIDGMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. 
               Q. 
            Who is your partner? - A. Mr. Boyce Combe, we are merchants and insurance-brokers; the prisoner was in our employment as a clerk, and had been three or four months.
Q. Did you, on the 16th of October, entrust him with any draft, for the purpose of being presented to your banker's, and for what amount? - A. I did, for 4261. I have the draft here, (produces it); that is the draft, it is upon Prescot's house for 4261.
Q. Did you give him any directions respecting the application of that money? - A. I desired him to receive it from the banker's, and make a payment upon 5000l. scrip consols.
Q. Did you deliver the draft to him yourself? - A. I did.
Q. Did you expect him to return that day into your service? - A. He did return, and the following morning he was not at the accompting-house, but I had no suspicion, knowing he had had a bad cold; I thought he might be indisposed.

Q. 
            Did he ever appear again at the accompting-house till he was apprehended? - A. Not to my knowledge; I think it is three weeks to-day since he was apprehended.

Q. 
            Was that instalment upon scrip paid by him? - A. It was not.
Q. To which purpose he was to apply that 4261.? - A. Yes.
Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney Q. Of course, an instalment upon scrip is received by some person in the Bank? - A. Yes, the cashier.

Q. I take it for granted the cashier is here, who was to receive it? - 
               A. 
            Not that I know of.
Q. You saw the prisoner again at Mr. Morris's, in Rood-lane; I believe about the 28th, or 29th of December? - A. Yes.

Q. 
            Did you receive your scrip back from him, or Mr. Morris, in his presence? - 
               A. 
            From Mr. Morris, but not himself.
Q. When you sent him first of all to pay this instalment, you put into his hand a receipt for former payments? - A. Yes, they are all on one sheet of paper.
Q. I need hardly ask, if these scrip receipts in the City of London are not marketable? - A. I do not know that that unfortunate young man could have converted them into money, but any person that was known certainly might have disposed of them with the utmost facility.
Q. I believe nearly 400l. had been paid upon these receipts? - A. Yes.
Q. He had been in your service a few months? - A. Yes, I had the highest opinion of him.
Q. And his friends are most respectable? - A. They are.

Q. Do you recollect the person who presented it? - A. It is impossible to do that; I paid the person who presented it, two notes of 200l. each, a 25l. and a 1l. note; the 200l. notes were numbered 109, and 110.
THOMAS NORTHOVER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a clerk in the Bank.

Q. Do you recollect seeing him on the 16th of October? - A. Yes, he brought two notes of 200l. each, to change into smaller notes.

            Look at that note - is that one of the 20l. notes that you delivered to the prisoner? (refers to his book)? - A. I believe it to be one of the 20l. notes, it checks with the book.
THOMAS MORRIS sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do.

Q. 
            Were you present when he was taken? - A. Yes; on Saturday the 26th of December, I was at Drury-lane Theatre in the boxes.
Q. Did you, at that time, know of his having left his master's employ improperly? - A. Yes; I had not been in the boxes above five minutes when the prisoner came in; the prisoner, on seeing me, ran out of the boxes; I immediately followed him, and persuaded him to go along with me; I said, George, I am very sorry to see you here; I then called a coach and took him with me in a coach to the Ordnance-tavern, on the Surry-side of Westminster-bridge; we both remained there that evening.
Q. Did you explain to him why you pursued such conduct? - 
               A. 
            When we came to the office, I explained to him, that I was acquainted with his having taken Mr. Bridgman's property; I told him, if, according to the advertisement that had appeared, in which Messrs. Combe and Bridgman wished to shew him lenity, if he would make all the restitution in his power, I would see what I could do for him; he then went and fetched the scrip.
Q. Did you accompany him to the place from whence he fetched the scrip? - A. I did not; he went by himself, and brought the scrip to me at my house, in Rood-lane.
Q. Did he give you any thing besides this scrip? - A. Not at that time; I continually repeated to him to disclose the property if he had any left, and on the Tuesday evening he produced me a 20l. Bank-note, a 1l. note, and a 7s. piece; he laid, that was all he had left.

Q. 
            Look at that 20l. Bank-note, and tell me if that was the note you received from him? - A. I believe this to be the same.
Court. Q. The scrip receipts that he delivered up to you was a security for former payments? - A. Yes; that scrip was to the value of near 3000l. that had been paid.

Q. 
            On what day was he taken before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Not till the Thursday following.

Q. 
            During a great part of that time, I believe, he remained in your house, with Mr. Bridgman's permission? - A. He did.
Q. How long have you known him? - 
               A. 
            More than four years.

Q. 
            Previous to this transaction, did you know a young man of a better character? - 
               A. 
            None; Ihad that opinion of him, that I would have been bound for a thousand pounds for him.

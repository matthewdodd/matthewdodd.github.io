MARGARET STOREY
. I live in Tarling-street, St. George's. The prisoner came to take a furnished lodging of me—I went up afterwards, on the 28th of November, and missed a pair of sheets, a pair of blankets, a bolster and case—these are them—the prisoner lived with me eight or nine weeks—she got her living by frock-body making.





JOHN HOPE
. I produce one shoot which I took in pledge from the prisoner.





MARIA PHILLIPS
. I have one sheet, which I bought about three weeks ago, of the prisoner—I asked whose it was, she said her own.

Prisoner. I was willing to replace the things.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

, and live at No. 1, Northumberland-street, Marylebone


 - the prisoner was my journeyman
 - On the 9th of September I came into the city, and left the pair of boots on my drawers - when I went back the boots were gone - I went after the prisoner, but could not find him - I returned home again and found the drawer had been broken open, and the shoes which had been in there, taken.

            . I live at No. 8, Stingo-lane - I bought a pair of shoes of some person, but I cannot tell whether it was the prisoner, as I had something to drink on the same day - I was not exactly drunk, but cannot call to mind who it was - I did not take notice of him - the prosecutor called on me about two days afterwards; these are the shoes.

            . I bind shoes for Mr. Terrett - the prisoner came for a pair which I had, and said, a customer was waiting for them - these are the shoes; I knew he worked for the prosecutor, and I let him have them.

JOHN HUMPHREYS. I am a carpenter
. These two planes were in a shed in my yard, at Vauxhall-bridge


; I saw them safe this day week; a watchman brought them to me last Tuesday; I then missed them; they have my name on them.

            . I saw the two prisoners on my beat on Monday, the 19th of June, about twenty minutes before five o'clock; they were about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Humphreys; Callaghan had these planes, which he dropped when I spoke, and they ran away; I sprung my rattle and pursued them; two other watchmen assisted in taking them; I never lost sight of them; I asked how they came by them, and one of them said they could not tell.

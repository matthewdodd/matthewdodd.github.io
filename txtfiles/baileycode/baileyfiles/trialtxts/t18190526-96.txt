ALEXANDER GORDON. I am a tobacco and snuff-manufacturer
, and live in High Holborn


, the prisoner worked for me, I suspected him. On the 25th of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I concealed myself in a dark cellar, looked through a crack into the front cellar where he worked, and saw him pick up a parcel of shag tobacco; he then stuffed it into the crown of his hat, put it on his head several times, to try how it fitted, and put a round piece of paper to cover it. He then took his neck handkerchief off, filled that full, padded it out like a stiffener, and tied it round his neck, and then went up to the shop - I followed, got between him and the door, and ordered him into the parlour, instead of which he ran down into the cellar. I followed - he was then taking the tobacco out of his hat. He gave me a violent shove, and threw it out of his hat, and a parcel out of his breeches. He then ran up stairs - my wife endeavoured to stop him; he gave her a shove - I followed and seized him, he made a great resistance. I gave him in charge; he wished me to forgive him.

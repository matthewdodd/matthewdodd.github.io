CATHERINE DRISCOLL
 and 




SARAH HUMPHRIES
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
28th of August, 2 bonnets, value 5s., the goods of 



Ann Dunn; and that Humphries had been before convicted of felony.






ANN DUNN
. I live at Newington. On the 28th of August these two bonnets were safe on the stand, inside my shop-window—about four o'clock in the afternoon I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned they were gone, and were in the policeman's hands—I can swear to them.





JOHN AGATE
 (police-constable M 46.) On the 28th of August I was on duty at Newington Causeway—a man came and spoke to me—I ran about 100 yards, and saw the two prisoners—they dropped these two bonnets be-tween them, tied up in this apron—I called to them, and they stopped—I knew them, and they knew me—I brought them and the bonnets to the prosecutor's shop—I am sure these bonnets fell from one of them—they were walking close together.

Driscoll's Defence. I saw the two bonnets by the door, and picked them up.

Humphries's Defence. I was coming with this little girl by the door, and picked up the bonnets.





HEMRY PICTON
 (police-constable M 175.) I produce a certificate of both the prisoners' conviction from the Clerk of the Peace's office of Surrey—(read)—the prisoners are the two persons who were convicted, and had three month's imprisonment.

DRISCOLL—


GUILTY
. Aged 14.

HUMPHRIES—

. Aged 12.




Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

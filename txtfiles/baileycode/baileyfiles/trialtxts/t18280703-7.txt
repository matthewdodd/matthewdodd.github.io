            . On the 30th of May, I was in the service of George Harker and another, of Martin's-lane


; their warehouse was secured on Friday evening, the 30th of May, at half-past seven o'clock; there were spices and ginger there; the ginger was in bags, marked H. & Co. and there were some empty bags not marked - there were two trucks on the premises, one belonging to Martin, and another to Mr. Ward, a wine-merchant: I left about half-past seven - the property was all safe then and the premises secured; I went there again at a quarter before eight in the morning, and found the outer-gate open, and both the trucks were gone - I missed five bags of ginger, about 10lbs. of nutmegs, and four or 5 lbs. of cloves were taken out of boxes, a bag of pimento, and four casks of white lead were gone: I was present when our truck was brought home that morning, about eleven o'clock.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. All the ginger was in bags, having the proprietor's name on them? A. It was; I cannot say whether the pimento bag was marked; I was the last person on the premises at night.
GEORGE HARKER. I have a partner. On the Monday week after the robbery, I got a search warrant, having advertised and received information from Thompson; I went with him and several officers to the prisoner's house, in Old Montague-street, Whitechapel; he came in while we were searching; I found some bags in the cellar, corresponding in every particular with what I had lost, the same quality and size - there was a piece cut out of them in the very identical place where my name had been marked; the hole was not filled up with another piece; in the corner of one of two I found some ginger of the same description as what I had lost, and in the house we found a small quantity of nutmegs, mace, and several other sorts of spices which I had lost; I also found a number of picklock-keys and a dark lantern; they were, I think, in the sitting-room; a small wax candle was left in our warehouse, which would just fit the nozzle of the dark lantern: I had seen the two trucks on the premises the evening before - one was brought back on the morning of the robbery; Evans brought back the other on the day of the search; but after the search; that one belonged to Mr. Ward.
Cross-examined. Q. How many bags did you find in the prisoner's house? A. Three - I lost six: the holes appeared to have been recently cut; they were fresher than the rest of the bags: I found a piece of ginger in one bag; there are several sorts of ginger; the prisoner kept no shop there; there was an appearance of his dealing in old clothes, as there were a number of old black clothes bags up stairs, and all those bags smelt strong of spice; I saw no lodgers - the prisoner came in about half-past one o'clock in the middle of the day; there was a woman in the house who appeared to be the mistress; I cannot say whether she was his wife.
COURT. Q. Where were the bags which smelt strong of spice? A. In the bed chamber; I think there were four or five large bags - they had all had ginger in them certainly, for it hung about the sides of the bag; the prisoner denied having had any ginger in his house for years before.

            . I am a labourer at the East India Docks. On Saturday, the 31st of May, about half-past five o'clock, I was going to work there, and saw a truck standing by the Tower gates with three bags on it; a young man was with it - the prisoner called out "Do you want a job;" he was not five yards from the truck, but he was not the young man - I am certain of his person: I said Yes - he said "Take hold of the truck and go on;" another person at the same time came and took hold of the truck with me - he was employed at the same time; we went on with the truck across Tower-hill to Old Montague-street; in our way one of the bags broke, by the wheel touching it, and something fell out; I looked round and found it was ginger - the prisoner then came up to assist in putting the bags right on the truck, and asked if either of us had a nail to secure the bag; I said I had no nail but I had a needle and if anybody had a bit of twine I would sew it up - he said never mind that would do; he took hold of the needle and stuck it into the bag - I said to the prisoner"Let me go back and pick up the ginger which has fallendown;" he said "No, never mind, go on" and I went on till we came to Old Montague-street; at the end of that street the prisoner came up to us at the truck, and pointing to a person in a white apron and fustain jacket, said"Follow that man" - we followed that man with the truck till we came to the house where the search-warrant was afterwards executed; we unloaded the bags, put them into the passage of the house - the prisoner then came up and said "Go on with the truck, follow that man;" we went on with the truck to the end of the street, and turned up towards Whitechapel-road - as we turned round the corner of a street, I recollected I had lent my needle to fasten up the bag; I did not go back for it - before I turned the corner of the street, I turned round and saw another truck at the door of the same house where we had left the bags at; this was about one hundred yards off - when we had turned the corner of the street, the man with the white apron said "How much is your charge" I said we should be satisfied with 6d. a piece; we were paid 1s. 6d. between us, and the man took the truck away up Whitechapel-road, which was the way I was going to the Docks; he was in front of me - I saw him lodge the truck at a wheelwright's shop near the London Hospital, and come away. About a week afterwards I read something in the newspaper and went to the prosecutors and communicated it to them the next day - I afterwards showed the officer where I had seen the truck left - he found it there, and I believe it to be the same; he took it to Mr. Harker's.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you read in the newspaper anything about a reward? A. No - I read that a robbery had been committed; there was nothing about a reward - I never saw the prisoner before; he was about twenty minutes with me, sometimes in front and sometimes in the rear - he sometimes walked on the flags; he was dressed in a black coat - I made no bargain for the job; it was broad day light, five o'clock; I did not observe any names on the bags - the names might be turned inside.
JURY. Q. Did the young man go away after you took charge of the truck? A. Yes; I believe he left of his own accord - the prisoner did not stop behind and pick up the ginger; I should think about a quarter of a pound dropped out - I did not know the man who helped me.

            . I am street-keeper in the neighbourhood of these premises; I went with Mr. Harker and two others to search the prisoner's house, on Monday the 9th of June, and have had possession of what I found there ever since - here are some picklock-keys which I found in a room on the ground floor, under a chest of drawers - I found a dark-lantern in the same place, and a cash-box; I was present when some spices were found by Forrester - the keys are not all picklocks; some are blank keys - two of them are picklocks and some skeletons.
Cross-examined. Q. Do not you often find such bundles of keys at ironmongers? A. Some are door keys - there was not the least appearance of ironmongery business being carried on there.

            . I accompanied Evans to search this house, and took possession of the spices; here is some ginger, nutmegs, mace, pimento, and cloves, a small quantity of each; I found two phosphorus-boxes. I saw Harker's man draw the truck out of a yard belonging to a carman named Cobley, on the day of the robbery - it was near a quarter of a mile from the prisoner's house.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the robbery - I was out of town at the time; those black bags are my clothes bags: I often buy pawnbroker's clothes, and want four or five bags to carry them. As to the keys and lantern I can give no account of them, except that I had a lodger named Day, who I am afraid has made a dupe of me; he appeared a respectable man, but has not been heard of since my wife told him these things had been found; he must have deposited them under the drawers - I know no more of the lantern than a child unborn; I bought the four bags in Petticoat-lane - I had three dozens cut in a similar way, to make door mats; there was not a word passed between Mr. Harker and me about spice.

            . I keep the Waggon and Horses public-house, at Tottenham, and am a widow. The prisoner is my own brother; this letter (looking at it) is my writing; I had it put into the post, and sent to him.
This letter was here read; it was dated Tottenham, 28th of May, and bore the post-mark of Upper Edmonton, 28th of May, at night; it was addressed to Mr. Ledge, No. 3, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel, and signed Elizabeth Green; it stated that she would be glad if he could come down on Thursday night or Friday morning, as her son was going out for a week or ten days' and requested an answer by return of post.
Witness. I received this answer by post from my brother.
This letter being read, was dated 28th of May, acknowledging the receipt of the former, and promising to be down to-morrow forenoon (Friday) as soon as possible.
Q. On the following day did your brother come down? A. He was down with me on Friday, the 30th of May, about twelve o'clock at noon, the day he mentions in the letter, and he never left my house till Saturday, the 7th of June, except to walk out in the evening; he was never out of my sight long enough to go to town; I am certain he was never absent above an hour; he always went to bed in proper time.
MR. RYLAND. Q. How far do you live from Towerhill? A. We call it six miles from my house to Shoreditch - it is quite the lower end of Tottenham, within a very few doors of Edmonton. I remember Mr. Salt's house, which has lately been pulled down; mine is half a mile further from town; my brother slept in the room adjoining mine: he came to assist in the business during my son's absence; he went to bed first at night - I got up first in the morning; I was always the last person up. I saw him go to bed on the Friday night; I saw him go up stairs with the candle, and bade him good night; I saw him in bed that night - I always take the candles: I do not recollect whether I took his candle. I saw him in bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went to bed myself very soon; I was down between six and seven next morning, and saw him when he came down about eight o'clock; he could not have gone out at night, because my doors were all fast at night, and I found them closed in the morning; I unfastened the street door that morning.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to bed, having fastened the house up - did you take your keys up with you? A. I did, and found them in the morning where I left them; I had locked my bed-room door; I found every thing as Ihad left it at night: I saw my brother come down in the morning in his shirt sleeves; he could not have gone out for want of the keys.
COURT. Q. On the top of this letter, are the words,"letter, No.1;" is that your brother's writing? A. Why I do not know - I dare say it was on the paper when I wrote it; it might be a piece of paper that had had something written on it before - I cannot say whether they were there when I wrote it; I cannot tell whether it is my brother's hand writing - it may be, but I cannot tell.
Q. There is No. 2 at the top of the other letter, do you believe that to be your brother's writing? A. I cannot tell, it does not look like his; I cannot say indeed whether he wrote it or not.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When your brother was in trouble did he send to you for the letter he sent you? A. No, I sent it to him last Sunday.
COURT. Q. Were the words, letter, No. 2 on it when you sent it to him? A. I really cannot say; I generally wrote to my brother myself.

                  PARKER
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Green. I remember the prisoner coming down there on Friday, the 30th of May, between twelve and one o'clock; he slept in the front room next to my mistress - I slept with my mistress, she goes to bed last - nobody could have gone out and returned without our knowledge in the night; the keys were on mistress's table - I saw her place them there, and they were there in the morning when she got up; she was the first who got up.
MR. RYLAND. Q. Do you mean to swear you saw her place the keys on the table? A. Yes; I went to bed with her, but was always in bed before her; we go up stairs together.
Q. Who told you it was Friday the 30th of May the prisoner came? A. I saw him, I remember the day, because my mistress' son went out on Friday morning; I heard he was in trouble on the Tuesday week following - I have not often talked this over with my mistress, and have not mentioned the day of the week or month to her; the prisoner's wife sent for me on Sunday, but I had been asked about this before that, by the people who knew him - he slept in the first floor front room; it has a casement window, which opens inside - I do not think he could casily get out of the window.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the casement window large enough? A. Yes; there was no appearance of a person having got out there - mistress always examined the doors and fastenings, the last thing at night.
COURT. Q. How long did the prisoner stay at your mistress's? A. From the 30th of May to the 7th of June, which was Saturday; I always recollect the days of the month by the newspaper, which we have every day - I generally look at the date; my mistress's son had left the house on the day the prisoner came - he is at Tottenham; he came back on the Friday following, the day before the prisoner left - I was not desired to take particular notice when the prisoner came, or to notice the day of the month.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  GEORGE
               



            . I live at Tottenham; I am a char-woman, and work every Saturday for Mrs. Green, at the Waggon and Horses public-house. On Saturday the 31st of May, I went there at half-past six o'clock in the morning; the prisoner came down to where I was at work - he was slip-shod, and in his shirt sleeves; it was impossible for him to be on Tower-hill at half-past five o'clock, for I saw him come down stairs at half-past six; I saw him again there on Saturday the 7th of June - I did not see him leave the house; he was assisting the landlady as her son had gone to Leicestershire on the 30th.
MR. RYLAND. Q. How do you know he went away on the 30th? A. I know I did not see him on the 31st, and the girl said he was gone; I think it was hardly halfpast six o'clock when I got there - I will not swear to five or ten minutes; it might be ten minutes to seven, or seven, when I saw the prisoner - it was not so late as eight; he could not have laid a-bed till eight - I have worked there more than two years, and go there every Saturday.
Q. How can you distinguish the 31st of May from any other Saturday? A. Because it was the call-over day for the parish officers; and a woman asked me the day of the month - I saw young Green there on Saturday the 7th of June.


                  GEORGE 
                  GROVES
               



            . I am a painter and glazier, and live at Tottenham. I saw the prisoner at Green's house about seven o'clock in the evening of the 30th of May; I staid there all the evening, and slept there - I saw him go up stairs to bed at half-past eleven o'clock; I walked up with him - I saw him there again the next evening; I heard no noise in the night.
MR. RYLAND. Q. Do you live with your father and mother? A. Yes; I slept there because there happened to be a disturbance down the lane, about ground rent - my father was afraid of his things being seized, and removed some of the things from his house; I slept at the back of the house, and he in front - I got up at five o'clock in the morning, and went out; I let myself out.
Q. You knocked Mrs. Green up to get the keys, I suppose? A. No, it is a spring-lock; I pulled it back, and drew the bolts back - I had no occasion to ask for the keys; I have slept there before, and could easily go out without disturbing anybody - there was a key left in the lock; I twisted it round, and opened it.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you have let yourself in as quietly? A. No; all the other doors were fastened - I went to work at Newington all day.
COURT. Q. How often do you sleep there? A. Sometimes not for two or three months; if I have a friend come down, I go and sleep there - my father and mother slept at home that night; they had moved what they could spare to Green's for safety - there was no bed for me at home; I remember the date because Mr. Green went down to Leicester - he returned on the 7th on Saturday.
Q. Are you sure of that? A. No; he returned on the Friday; I remember that, because we did not expect him that night, and the prisoner slept with me - he is at home now minding the house; he knew I was coming here - he had told me a week before that he was going to Leicester on the 30th, and that he should return on the Friday.

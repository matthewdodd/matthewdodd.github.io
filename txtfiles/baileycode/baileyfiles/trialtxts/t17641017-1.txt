            . I am a gang's-man; the prisoner was at work for me last Saturday se'nnight, at Smart's key


, in the capstan-garret, with several others. I saw him break into a hogshead of sugar; and take sugar out, and put it within his shirt and trowsers: he went to go down the back way, and we stopped him; we got a constable, and found seven pounds of sugar upon him.

            . I am a constable for the keys: here is seven pounds of sugar (producing it), which we found upon the prisoner, some in his shirt, and some in his trowsers.
Prisoner's Defence.
They picked up three or four lumps of sugar under the wheel, and put it all together; I did not take all that. I took none out at the head; there were little holes, out of which I took it.

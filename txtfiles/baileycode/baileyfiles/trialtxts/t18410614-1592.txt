JOHN MILDWATERS
. I am a sailor on board a merchant ship—I had been about three weeks from my ship—she was in dock—I met the prisoner on the 29th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, in the New-road—I never saw her before—I was sober—I went and slept with her in some back street about the grove—I paid her—I awoke a few minutes after seven o'clock, and found she was dressed ready to start—I asked what time it was—she said eight o'clock—I doubted it, and took my watch from under my pillow, and it was but a few minutes after seven—I said, I should turn out—I got up, put my watch on the table, and went to wash my hands—she then went down, and said, she wanted to go into the yard—I had no suspicion—I went to the table, and missed my watch—she never returned—I gave information to the police-sergeant—she was taken about half-past ten o'clock the same morning—this is my watch.





JOSEPH WOLSTENHOLME
. I am assistant to a pawnbroker in Stafford-street, Lisson-grove—I produce the watch pawned by the prisoner on the 29th of May, about ten o'clock.





EDWARD BROWN
 (police-constable D 20.) The prosecutor told me of his loss—I found the watch at the pawnbroker's—I then went with one of the pawnbroker's men to James-street, saw the prisoner, and took her.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

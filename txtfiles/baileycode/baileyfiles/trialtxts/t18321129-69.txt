; the prisoner took a room of me, and lodged there one week - he paid 2s. out of 4s. 6d. On the 31st of October I went up for my money, and missed the sheet - I asked what he had done with it - he said he had taken it to his mother, to be washed; I said,"Why did you do that, I told you I washed once in three weeks?" he would not tell me any thing else, but sent me to his mother's, as he said, but found his mother had been dead for years - I have never found my sheet.

Prisoner's Defence. I went out on the Wednesday morning, and returned in the evening - my room door was open; there was no lock on the door, and any one might open it; I was accused of taking the sheet - I said the young woman who lived with me might have taken it; I did not know she was then gone - the officer had time to apprehend her, but he would not.

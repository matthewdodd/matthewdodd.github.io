RICHARD FINNEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Zachary Mudge, form his person.






ZACHARY MUDGE
. I lodge in Arundel-street, Strand. On the 28th of May, in the afternoon I was walking in St. James's-street—I was watching the line of carriages—I heard a scuffle behind me—I turned and saw the prisoner in the custody of two officers—one of them had my handkerchief—this is it—it is mine.





JOHN FOWLER
 (police-constable P 106.) I was on duty in St. James's-street on that day. About three or four o'clock I saw the prisoner, and watched him some time—I saw him make many attempts at several gentlemen's pockets—I saw him go behind the prosecutor and take this handkerchief out of his pocket—the moment he took it out, as he dropped his hand with the handkerchief in it, I seized him, and my brother officer assisted me.

Prisoner. Q. Where did you first see me? A. At the top, towards Piccadilly—I lost sight of you for nearly half an hour—it was an hour from the time I first saw you to the time I took you—no one was with you.





SAMUEL WRIGHT
 (police-constable 172 P.) I saw the prisoner attempt several gentleman's pockets—I saw him go to the prosecutor and take the handkerchief from his pocket—Fowler seized him—I assisted him—I never lost sight of the prisoner from the time he took the handkerchief.

Prisoner. They are both perjuring themselves—I had been out of a situation three years—I had been with the Earl of Plymouth till his death three years ago—I was not in the street five minutes.

            . My husband's name is John, he is a surgeon
; I keep a poulterer's shop in Turtle-street


; the goods mentioned in the indictment were in my shop on the 4th of this instant, at about six in the evening, and were brought in again with the prisoner in about four or five minutes after. I did not see them taken away. I knew them to be my property.

            . I live near the prosecutrix. I saw the prisoner lift up her latch softly, and go into her shop, and shut the door after him in about four or five minutes after. I saw him come out again. I saw the necks of fowls hang down from under his arm. I told my husband, and he ran and took him about forty yards from the door, and brought him back again; and the prosecutrix said the fowls, rabit, and sausages were her property.

            . My wife, the last witness, told me there was a man had stripped the prosecutrix's shop; I ran and took him, and brought him back; he had five fowls, one rabit, and a pound of sausages upon him, all which the prosecutrix said were her's. The prisoner said he bought them in the same street for half a crown.
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought the goods of a man, and gave half a crown for them.

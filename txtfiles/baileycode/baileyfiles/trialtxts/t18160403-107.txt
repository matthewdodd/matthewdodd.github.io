            . About eleven o'clock on the night of the 8th of February, I was coming home up Bow-street, Bloomsbury


, and two men followed me from the corner of Holborn; immediately the prisoner with three or more behind him, met me in front, and prevented my proceeding; I immediately stepped on the outside of the curh-stone; but the prisoner stepped in front of me again, and the others pressed on behind me, and immediately I felt my watch go; the prisoner got clear off, and I was pushed down; the others then took from me a one-pound note and a sixpence. The watchman made his appearance shortly after, but could give me no assistance, and therefore I went home. I went the next day to Bow-street. and stated the circumstances. I am certain of the prisoner's person.

            . I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th, at his lodgings; I searched him and the lodgings, but found nothing.

            . On the 24th of December I was robbed of the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, out of my House in Hoxton-Square; two of the Shirts were found at Mr Harris's, a Pawnbroker's, the Hat and Waistcoat at Mr Hayley's, who had stopped them, and the other two Shirts and the Spoon were sold out-right.

             came to my House, with this Hat on, and offer'd it to sell, and said he found it in the Fields, but would not tell me where; Hudson stood behind him, and I heard him say, he wish'd he had never seen Spurham ; that he had brought him into a premunire, for he had robbed somebody in Hoxton-Square. They both ran away together, and left the Things behind them: They were both taken, and Mr Saltwell owned them before the Justice.

            . On the 24th of December I was in my Kitchen, and heard the Door crack; I went out to see what was the Matter, and saw the Prisoner Spurham upon the Stairs, with a Hand-Basket in his Hand; and as he was going out at the Door. I asked him what he did there; he said, D - n you, you Bitch, what did you disturb me for; I was asleep upon the Stairs. He went out of the House, I after him, and saw Hudson and another Man with him, and they all three run away together. I did not miss the Things till the Evening: I had no Mistrust that the Man had robb'd me.

            . On the 24th of December, the Prisoner Hudson brought me these two Shirts, upon which I lent him 3 s. 6 d. supposing them to be his own, and delivered them to Mr Saltwell the Owner. Spurham said he found these Things in the Fields, covered with Weeds; and Hudson said, all he knew of the Matter was, that Spurham desired him to pawn two Shirts for him, that he pawned them for 3 s. 6 d. and gave Spurham the Money.

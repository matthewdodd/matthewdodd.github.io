FREDERICK EVANS PEPPER
. I belong to the West India Docks. On the 19th of June I got up about five o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner

getting over the pales of Mr. Wright's garden, of No. 7, Chapman-street, Commercial-road—I went to see for a policeman, and the prisoner was gone—the next morning I saw him coming over the same spot of ground, and putting something into his pocket—I went and found two policemen—they took him—this cock and pipe were found on him—I saw this pipe fitted to the premises—it corresponded exactly, and appeared to be fresh cut.





RICHARD MERRONY
. I am a policeman. On the 20th of June, the witness came to me—I went and took the prisoner, about ten yards from the premises—I found this cock and pipe on him—the pipe tallied exactly to where it was cut from.





SARAH WRIGHT
. I am the wife of Thomas Wright—this pipe belongs to us—it was fixed at the back of the house—I saw it all safe on the Tuesday night.

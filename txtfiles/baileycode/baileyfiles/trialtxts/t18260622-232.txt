            . I am a private patrol at the Royal Exchange. On the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was in St. Paul's-church-yard; the children were coming out of the cathedral - there were a great many persons at the North gate; I saw the prisoner go up to a gentleman, and pick his pocket of this handkerchief; he put it into his left-hand breeches pocket - I endeavoured to get near the gentleman, to speak to him, but could not; I followed the prisoner - he was never out of my sight; I took him to the Goose and Gridiron, and found the handkerchief in his left-hand breeches pocket - it appeared to be the very same he had taken from the gentleman. I found another handkerchief in his hat, and in his trousers I found a gown, wrapped round him. I knew him before.
Prisoner. Q. Did not you ask a gentleman standing by, if he had lost a handkerchief? - A. Yes; but that was because he was endeavouring to pick another pocket, which made me ask the gentleman if he had done it.
Prisoner's Defence. I had bought the gown and handkerchief in a public-house of a woman; I had not been at St. Paul's, ten minutes, when the officer took me; this handkerchief was one my mother gave me.

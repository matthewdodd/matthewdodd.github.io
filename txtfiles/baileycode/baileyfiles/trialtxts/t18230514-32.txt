            . I am a silversmith
, and live in Paternoster-row. On the 21st of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was passing through Panyer-alley


 into Paternoster-row


. I felt my pocket move; the prisoner rushed by me into Paternoster-row; I missed my silk handkerchief, and pursued him into Cheapside, and never lost sight of him; he ran down Foster-lane; I saw him drop it in the middle of the lane, and picked it up, and he was secured.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure you did not drop it - A. Yes; I felt my pocket move immediately; before he rushed by me.

            . I am a shoe-maker

 in Newport-Street


, in partnership with Adam Dunford. About the 4th of August last I lost two pair of shoes; the prisoner worked for me; I often missed shoes when he came to the shop to take his money. Upon the 10th or 11th of August I missed a pair of shoes that were made for a gentleman, out of that part of the shop where the prisoner rested. I went to the pawnbrokers, and at Mr. Lane's, in Drury-Lane, I found two pair, but they are not the shoes mentioned in this indictment.

            . I am servant to Mr. Jarvis, a pawn-broker, in Fetter-Lane. Upon the 11th of August the prisoner brought this pair of men's shoes to my master's shop to pawn; (producing them) he pawned them in the name of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Gardner
               



            .
Atkinson. They are the property of my partner and me; they are marked D. A. besides I could swear from the make of them that they are our property.
The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.

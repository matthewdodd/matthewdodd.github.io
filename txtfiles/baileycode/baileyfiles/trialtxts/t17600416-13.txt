John Waldgrave. I am a publican
, and keep the St. Luke's Head in Longacre



. The three prisoners came into my house on the 10th of March, about one in the day, called for a pint of beer and sat down all together in a box in the publick room. Elizabeth Parker went out into the yard, where she staid about two or three minute, and then came in and sat down again. In about a minute or two after that Gates gave me a shilling to change. I changed it, and took for the pint of beer. Then they went away, and I said they were welcome. In my back room were some crack'd pewter pots that ran, and I had put them by there A the three prisoners were all very well dressed, I did not mistrust any thing, neither had I missed any thing. After this, the same day, I was sent for by justice Welch, to know whether I had lost any I said I did not know that I had lost any He desired I would look among some were there, which I did, and found two pint, one half pint, one pewter dish, and one pewter plate, my property; these were out of the back room. ( Produced and deposed to.)
Q. Did you see the prisoners there?
Waldgrave. They were all three there.
Q How long before had you seen these things house?
Waldgrave. I saw them all in our back place that morning about ten o'clock.
Q. What did they say for themselves before the justice?
Waldgrave. They said nothing to me, nor I to them
Q. Did you hear them say any thing there?
Waldgrave. There were abundance of things besides mine that they were charged with.

            . I was constable, and found these goods here produced on the three prisoner on the 10th of March. I was sent for by a person that keeps the King's Head at Marybone, who told me he believed he had three thieves in his house.
Q. What is his name?
Sherriden. His name is Scruby. He told me he saw one of the women, that is, 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Parker 
               



            , take a pot off the shelf. The prisoners were all three together. The woman of the house asked the prisoner what she had taken the pot off the shelf for. The prisoner said, Lord! madam. Then I spoke to her. She said, it is under the table, I only took it to make water in. This made me suspect they had got other stolen goods about them. They having a sheet with things tied up in it, which I think lay on the table, I said I would see what was in it. Then she took and put it under her cloak.
Q. Did any of the others seem to have the care of it?
Sherriden. When I first saw it, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Parker 
               



             had it in her apron, and Elizabeth had another bundle under her cloak. The bundle in the sheet I did not examine till we came to justice Welch's; but I examined the other bundle, as some of the things mentioned in the indictment were found in the last bundle. I shall not trouble the court with the contents of the bundle I opened at that house. Before the justice, Elizabeth said she bought the things of a woman in the street. We opened them. She could not tell the woman's name, nor where she lived. Gates said he knew nothing of the matter, and

Gates's Defence.
I never was out of the publick room; I know nothing of the taking the things.

            's Defence.
I had been to my brother's; he is a salesman in Smithfield Market. When we came into Piccadilly, one Mrs. Edwards gave us these things, and desired I would carry them to Knightsbridge, saying, she would call for them on the morrow morning, and that she was going to keep a publick house at Hammersmith. I sent for her since, and she is run away. I went round to go to Paddington, and I was stop'd at Marybone.

            's Defence.
I have nothing more to say than what my sister has said.
For Gates.
Mr. Simonds. I have known Gates eight or nine years; he has worked with me almost five years, on and off.
Q. What is his business?
Simonds. He is a farrier; I live at Knightsbridge.
Q. What is his general character?
Simonds. I know nothing to the contrary, but that he always behaved very honestly.

            . I have known Gates about four years; he was always reported to be a very honest man: He has had an opportunity to take things from me where he has done business, and I never found that he did.

Spinage. It is very good for what I know. He has been in my house many a time, and I have trusted him with things of considerable value; he is an industrious man.
Q. Where do you live?
Spinage. I live at Knightsbridge. I never heard any body insinuate but that he was strictly honest.

            . I have known Gates about four years.
Q. What is his general character?

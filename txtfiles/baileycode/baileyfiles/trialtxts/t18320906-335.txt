ISAAC HEWITT. I lived at No. 1, Savoy-street, Strand


, at the time of this robbery - it was my dwelling-house, and in the precinct of the Savoy; I am a wine and spirit merchant
. The prisoner came into my service on Friday, the 24th of September, 1831, and she left me on the Monday, taking with her these things - we did not know she was gone till a ring came at the bell, and she did not answer; I never saw her again till the 6th of September, in this year, when I saw her in Chandos-street - when I spoke to her she said she did not know me, but in less than a minute she said she did; she said at the station that she had sold the things the next day to a Jew, for 3l., and she should not know him again - they were worth at the lowest rate 5l. 6s.

WILLIAM CLAYTON
. I keep a chandler's shop in North-place, Putney. About six o'clock, on the 3rd of December, I heard a raiding of the scales—when I came to look the till was open, and I missed two loaves from the window—I saw a boy go out with them—they are mine—I had seen the till safe half an hour before—I took the candle, and ran after the boy with the loaves—I overtook him, and found he had dropped the bread—it was taken up and brought in by his mother, who was close by—I went, found the prisoner, and secured him.

Prisoner. I took the loaves because I was hungry—I did not touch the till. Witness. I have seen him in my shop before—he lives close by and if the door is not locked he comes in, which he did then.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prisoner had been ten times in custody.)

. When I got up on the Sunday morning, before new Michainas day, I found a door broke open, and missed eight live geese out of my cart-house.

Q. How came you to take them up?

             looking over to the prosecutor's yard, said, I'll have some here, I have had some here divers times. I said, pray on't meddle with any thing here; then he said, if you make a noise I'll give you two or three good knocks on the head; he went and laid hold of the door and pulled it open, I walked away from them, they all three came and brought eight geese to me, and Biss said, d - n your creeping head, what do you stay here for?
Prisoner's defence.
I was out the night the things were lost a drinking, and was fuddled. I was along with them, they took me out, but I do not know where they took me.

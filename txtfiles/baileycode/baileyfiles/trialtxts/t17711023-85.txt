            . I am a smith
. My master lent me to a gentleman, at Saffron hill, to make lamp irons. I work at Mr. Hopkins's in Carnaby market; my shop mates got me a lodging, in Cow-cross; they took me up Black Boy alley


; the next day, the 14th of September, I went up Black Boy alley again; I was not sure I was right, being a stranger, I saw the door; it was about eleven o'clock at night; I stopt at a door that I saw open, and asked if I was in the right way to Cow-Cross, and there was a young woman.
Q. Was you sober?
Trueman. I had a pint of beer; there was a young woman bid me come in, and she would put me in the way to Cow Cross; and while she was talking to me at the door this man came up; he was in the house, and laid hold of me by my arms. (I had stept into the house about a yard) the woman put her hands into my pocket; I had a five and threepence, a shilling, and one farthing; I gave a struggle and said she has got my money; he took me by the shoulder, and said none of your soldiers tricks; thrust me out of the house and shut the door.
Q. Are you sure that is the man?
Trueman. Yes; I found him on the Tuesday after, and took him to the justice; I found him in the same house. Two of my shop mates went with me to the house, and we took him to the justice; he said, it was not him, it was a woman he called 
               
                  Ann
                   Stone
               



             that took my money, he did not deny that he held me, but told the justice he should not have done it if he had not been in liquor; I have never seen the woman since; none of my shop-mates are here.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing about it; he came to the house, and said how do you do; he said don't you know I was here on Saturday night; I said no; he said don't you know I was robbed here; I said no; I waited half an hour for an officer, but none came; the woman he speaks of knew she was guilty, and therefore she fled: had I known I was guilty, I would have fled, but I staid, I don't know the woman that robbed him, but by the description he gave, it is 
               
                  Ann
                   Stone

               Guilty

            . I am clerk
 to Messrs. Carvel and Young, of Gray's Inn. On Sunday evening, a little after ten o'clock, I was coming down Cow-lane


 from Smithfield, the prisoner came to my right side, seized my watch-chain, and pulled my watch out, I turned round, collared him, and said he had got my watch - He threw it down; the watch went one way, and the case another. I picked up the case, but kept hold of the prisoner. Mrs. Nelson picked up the watch, and gave it to me.

            . I was returning with Mr. Elderton-the prisoner followed behind us for about thirty yards, then drew Mr. Elderton's watch out - I saw him do it. Mr. Elderton collared him, and he dropped it; I picked the watch up, and called the watchman, who took the prisoner.

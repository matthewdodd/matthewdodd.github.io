            . I am a pawnbroker
, and live in St. John's-street



. On the 1st of January, between seven and eight in the evening, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Toole 
               



             came into my shop, and asked me if I had got a two-feet rule; I told him I had never a one; he had not been gone out above a minute before my window was broke, and a pair of stays taken out; I enquired, and was told by 
               
                  John 
                  Child 
               



             that he saw the prisoner Toole, whom he called Irish Jack, about my door; on the 12th he saw him, and watched him into a public-house, and came and told me; I went and took him before Justice Girdler; he was committed; after which he sent me a letter to come to him; I went; he acknowledged he got a fellow prisoner to write it.
Produced and read to this purport:
Clerkenwell Prison.
"Sir,
"I should be very glad to speak a word or
"two to you, something to your advantage; I
"am taken prisoner on your account; I should be
"very glad to see you as soon as possible.
"Sir, I am your humble servant,
"

            ."When I went, he desired I would admit him an evidence, and he would tell me where my stays were, and help me to them; I told him I could not, but would go to the Justice about it; the Justice desired me to order the prisoner up to him; there he told me he and Matthews, and another not taken, had broke my window, and taken my stays and given them to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Hart 
               



             to pawn, and she pawned them for half a guinea, but where he could not tell; the Justice said, he believed he was a very bad fellow, and would not admit him an evidence; going back he begged of the keeper to take his irons off, and he would take us to the place where Matthews and Hart were; he took us to a house in Black-boy-alley, there we found them both in bed together, and three women in another bed; I found the stays at a pawnbroker's at the corner of Stonecutter-street, pawned in the name of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Hart 
               



             for half a guinea.

            . I live with Mr. Patterson a pawnbroker, at the corner of Stonecutter-street;

             pawned these stays about eight o'clock in the evening on the 1st of January, with me, for half a guinea.

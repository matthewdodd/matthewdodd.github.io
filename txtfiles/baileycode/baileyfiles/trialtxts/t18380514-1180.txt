FREDERICK ROBINSON
. I am a clerk to George Basham; he lives at No. 20, Bedford-place, Russell-square. At half-past seven o'clock on the evening

of the 19th of April I was at my desk in the office—I heard a noise—I went down, and saw the prisoner go out of the outer door—I followed him, and when about half-way down Bedford-place—he threw the candlestick from under his coat—I brought him back—a policeman was fetched, and he was given in charge—the candlestick was picked up, this is it—(looking at it)—it is my master's property.

Prisoner's Defence. I was looking after a situation—coming through Great Russell-street I heard a cry of stop thief, and the gentleman laid hold of me.





JOSEPH YOUNG
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the man who was tried and convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

MATTHEW LOWTHER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of April, 1 sheet, value 6s.; the goods of 




Edward Marklew; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD MARKLEW
. I keep the Ball and Crown, in Kingsland-road On the afternoon of the 29th of April, the prisoner was in the tap-room—he had two or three penny-worths of gin—I was coming across the bar—I turned my head, and saw him come down stairs from the first-floor room—I asked him what business he had up-stairs—he said he had been up to speak to a little boy belonging to a lodger in the house—he did not know that lodger—I observed his coat was buttoned, and asked what he had got there—I unbuttoned his coat, and he pulled the sheet out himself—I gave him in charge.





WILLIAM SMITH
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was a witness on the trial—he is the person who was tried and convicted.

Prisoner's Defence. On that occasion I was falsely tried. In consequence of one trouble coming after another, I was almost distracted, and did not know what I was doing—on the day I was at the prosecutor's house I spoke to the little boy two or three steps up—I acknowledge I had the sheet in my hand, and I said I had no right to have it—I had no intention of taking it—it was entirely through trouble and misfortune that I knew not what I was doing.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

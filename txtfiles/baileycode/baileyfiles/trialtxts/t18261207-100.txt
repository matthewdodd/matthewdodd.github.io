            . I was going into my father's shop, and saw the prisoner behind the counter, with something like brass in his hand - I looked up, and saw the timepiece was gone; I collared him; he dropped it, and I took it up, but thinking he would beat me, I let him go; and called Stop thief! my father ran down the street, and took him.

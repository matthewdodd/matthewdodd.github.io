            . On Monday night I was coming out of Drury-lane Theatre, with a friend and his lady. On turning into Drury-lane


, a woman came up, and said my pocket had just been picked. I felt, and missed my handkerchief, the prisoner was taken and conveyed to a public-house. I found it concealed in his bosom - it was safe when I came out of the Theatre.

            . I am constable of St. Pancras, and was returning with my wife from the Lyceum Theatre, and saw the prisoner try the prosecutor's pocket, feeling it with his hand; he then stept aside, and I saw the corner of the prosecutor's handkerchief hanging out of his pocket. In crossing the gateway, I saw the prisoner take it quite out. I secured him, and my wife informed the prosecutor - we took him to a public-house, and found it in his bosom.

GEORGE ISAACS
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



George Tibbetts, from his person.






SAMUEL TIBBETTS
. I am a solicitor, and live at Oundle. I was with my brother George on the evening of the 9th of August in Gray's-inn-lane, and noticed the prisoner take his hand from ray brother's pocket—he was close behind us—my brother turned round, and the prisoner stopped instantly—my brother collared him, and picked up the handkerchief close behind him—there was nobody near enough to have taken it but him, there was nobody within twenty or thirty yards.





GEORGE TIBBETTS
. I was with my brother, and noticed the shadow of a hand coming towards my pocket—I instantly felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I turned round, and saw the prisoner's hand move from behind me—I seized him, and said, "You rascal, you have taken my handkerchief—I found it on the ground—there was nobody else near me—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it.)

Prisoner. He called "Stop thief" after two other men who ran away.

Witness. I never uttered a word to any body but him—I had not used my handkerchief since I left London-street—I felt rather a push thirty yards before—I then felt it, and it was safe—it could not have dropped out.





GEORGE COXHEAD
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody on Holborn-hill—I produce the handkerchief, which the prosecutor gave me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

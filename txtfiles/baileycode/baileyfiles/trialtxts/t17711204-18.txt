            . The prisoner was a sawyer
 at Durham yard; he was brought in to lodge with me; I work'd as a labourer
 in Durham-yard; I am a Chelsea Pensioner
. I went on the 16th of January to receive my pension. I paid some money I owed; then I had two guineas and a half, and some halfpence, in my waistcoat pocket. When I came home, he said, Kevan, if I had as much money as you, I would have a good drink out of it, and you are sober. I said, yes, three of us have only had two pots of beer. When I waked between four and five in the morning, the prisoner was gone, and all my money; my waistcoat was at my bed-side. I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and gave information against the prisoner; and I never saw any more of him till about a fortnight ago, when he was taken up on another charge, and Sir John sent to Durham-yard for me. The prisoner confessed before the Justice that he took my money.
Prisoner's Defence.
He said he would let me off for paying a shilling a week.
Prosecutor. His mother offered to pay me a shilling a week, but I said I could not do it.
He called one witness, who had known him twenty years, and gave him a good character.

             sworn.
I live at No. 4, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street


, in Mr. 
               
                  Charles
                   Heath
               



            's house; I lodge there, and keep a school

, I and my sister; I occupy the first floor, and the back garret: on the 23d of December last I lost the things from the garret; I believe they came in by the window; I had shut the sash a little before two, but had not fastened it (I saw it at ten o'clock at night), nor my sister; the sash was only slid to, I did not fasten it; at ten o'clock at night I found it open; there were gone several gowns; my sister and I were up almost together.
Did you find any drawers, or any thing, broke open? - Yes, the drawers were all a little open, and what was left was about the ground; I have found some of the things again, and almost all.
Were the things in the indictment there at two o'clock that day? - They were; the drawers were not locked; they were found by the constable, Bilby; I know nothing about the prisoner; the door was fastened, and my sister unlocked it herself; so nobody could go in that way: I am single.

             sworn.
Confirmed the above.

                   BILBY
               



             sworn.
I took the prisoner with the property.

             sworn.
I am a watchmaker; I saw the man with the things on his head, and saw it taken from him: just as we got to Peter-street, he attempted to get away; and in my attempting to hinder him, he cut my finger very much, I believe with a penknife.


                  JOHN
                   GAST
               



             sworn.
I am a constable: I was with the last witness; I saw Bilby lay hold of the prisoner with the bundle; I searched him in the watch-house, and found a key and an handkerchief in his breeches. (Produced.)
The key deposed to by 
               
                  Sarah
                   Chapel
               



            . It fits the box taken out of my room that night; the handkerchief I had one like it. (The bundle of articles deposed to.) I suppose the value that belongs to me is between twenty and thirty shillings.

            . Mine is worth thirty-six shillings: I am sure all these things were in the room that day; and they are my property.

            . I know Mr. Hughes' shop, in Regent-street


 - I have part of his premises. On the 6th of January I saw the prisoner come into his shop, and take this coat from the end of his counter, about half-past six o'clock in the evening - he ran away; I followed - he was a perfect stranger; I saw him throw down the coat by the further door of the shop, near Warwick-street chapel, and it was afterwards picked up - I did not lose sight of him till be was taken.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was sent for, and took the prisoner and the coat.
JOSEPH HUGHES. This is my coat, and was in my shop.
Prisoner's Defence. I had called on an employer in Windmill-street - the weather being cold, I was running at a gentle pace; I was knocked down by a gentleman's servant, and as soon as I rose I was seized by the witness, who said I had stolen a coat - I said I had not; he sent for an officer - it does not seem feasible that I should steal the coat: surely I am not to be robbed of my liberty, and every thing dear to me, on the evidence of one witness; what the witness says is false.

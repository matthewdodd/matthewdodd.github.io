1767. 




HENRY HILL
 and 




HENRY EVANS
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



John Hawkins, from his person; and that Hill had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN HAWKINS
, mariner, Salisbury-place, Rotherhithe. On Wednesday,

the 29th of May, I was at Greenwich fair—I had a handkerchief, which I lost out of my pocket—this is it—I know it by a darn.





JOHN CARPENTER
 (police-constable R 84.) I was at the fair, and saw the prisoners following the prosecutor through the fair—Hill went behind him, and tried to get his handkerchief—he left him for a minute or two, and then Evans pushed Hill in front of the prosecutor, Hill put his head on the prosecutor's breast, and Evans took out the handkerchief—they both went away—Evans was about giving Hill the handkerchief, when I caught hold of both their hands with it.





CHARLES GOUOH
 (police-constable L 83.) I produce a certificate of Hill's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.
(Evans received a good character.)

HILL—


GUILTY
. Aged 16.—

EVANS—

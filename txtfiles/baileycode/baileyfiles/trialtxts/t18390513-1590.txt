GEORGE M'FARLIN, alias
BEDFORD

 , was indicted for

 stealing, on the 
11th of May, 12 pairs of trowsers, value 6l. 12s., the goods of 



Francis Bartholomew; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS WATSON
 I am shopman to Mr. Francis Bartholomew, of Fleet-street. on the 11th of May the prisoner came to the shop, and immediately stole a bundle of trowsers that were lashed down to the side counter—he broke the cord asunder, and ran off—he dropped some of them—my employer picked up two pairs on the pavement, just outside the door—I ran after the prisoner, he was stopped with the property—he gave five pairs into my arms—these are them.





HENRY BAILEY
 (City police-constable, No 169.) I saw the prisoner in Water-lane—there was a cry, and I stopped him—he had these trowsers.

Prisoner's Defence I left the House of Correction—I was destitute of friends and money—all that night I wandered about, and the next morning I pawned the silk handkerchief off my neck, on that I lived till that day, and then I was forced to do what I did—my character is lost through my own folly undoubtedly.





WILLIAM FINN
 (City police-constable, No. 445.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present when the prisoner was tried here.




GUILTY
 Aged 32.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

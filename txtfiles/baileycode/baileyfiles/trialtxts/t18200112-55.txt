            . I live in the Minories with my father, whose name is John, he is a silk-mercer. On the 9th of December, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Bishopsgate-street


, about five or six doors down - they were taking in ice at Messrs. Hoffman's, the pastry-cooks, which obstructed the passage. I felt something going out of my pocket. I immediately put my hand to my side, and found my handkerchief gone; I turned round, and saw the prisoner alone, he pushed through the crowd, from me - he caught my eye, and began to run, which excited my suspicion. I ran after him; he kept turning his head round, and increased his pace - we were both in the middle of the road. He ran into Leadenhall-street, and into the market where the stages stand. I there saw him throw the handkerchief down, and caught it as it fell - he was secured without my losing sight of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

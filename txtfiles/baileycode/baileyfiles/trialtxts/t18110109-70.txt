            . I am a hosier
, 78, Chiswell-street


. On the 27th of December, between twelve and one, I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, and on my coming out I saw the prisoner going out with the roll of flannel under his arm; I followed him, brought him back, and took the flannel from him. This is it, I am sure it is my property.
Prisoner's Defence. As I was going along Chiswell-street, near Whitbread's brewhouse, a gentleman asked me to carry it for him as far as Smithfield; I had not carried it half a minute before the gentleman took me.
Prosecutor. I saw him go out of the shop with the flannel under his arm.

At twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the morning of the 5th of February I was passing Mr. Pain's shop, and saw the two prisoners dodging about by the shop—I went to my work, And in ten minutes after, I saw Williams walk away with the chest on his shoulder, and Walker was walking by his side.

William. Q. Can you swear it was me? A. Yes—I cannot swear it was the same chest that is here now.

Williams. Q. Can you swear it was me? A. Yes—I knew you both.

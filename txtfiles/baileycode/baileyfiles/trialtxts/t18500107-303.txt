WILLIAM STONE



, stealing 26 spoons, value 13l.; the goods of 



Thomas Dale and another, in their dwelling-house.






JAMES BROWN
. I am a waiter at the Gloucester Hotel, Piccadilly, which is kept by Thomas and Frederick Dale. They live in the hotel—on 30th Dec., between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the coffee-room, standing behind a sideboard—I turned round to look at the fire, and saw a shadow on the wall—I stepped forward to see who it was, and saw the prisoner with a parcel in his hand, leaving the coffee-room—as I passed out of the door after him I saw that the plate-basket was empty where the spoons

ought to have been—I caught the prisoner by the collar, and he directly dropped the spoons—I asked him what he meant by doing it—he said he had got nothing of mine that was not his—I saw the barmaid pick up the spoons; there were twenty-six, worth 13l.—they are silver, they belonged to my masters—I had seen them safe about three—the basket was standing in the pantry, which is just inside the coffee-room door.





ISAAC TURVEY
 (policeman, C 105). I was called, and took the prisoner—I produce two of the spoons—the house is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square.

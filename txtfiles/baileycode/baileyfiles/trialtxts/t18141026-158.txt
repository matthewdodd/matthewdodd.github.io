            . I am a linen draper
, No. 16, Grace's Alley, Wellclose-square


. I lost these blankets on Thursday, the 27th of October, a little after six in the evening. I went to the door, and immediately missed these blankets; I looked up the alley, and saw the prisoner with the blankets hanging down, they being so large he could not fold them up so, but what I could see them; I pursuad him; on turning round, Gillmore the officer met him, and took him in custody with the blankets upon him.

            . I am an officer. I stopped the prisoner with these blankets upon him; I took the prisoner into custody; there was the shop bill upon them. The prisoner said, a gentleman came out of the shop, and gave him the blankets to carry. This is the shop bill, and there is the shop mark besides.
Prosecutor. They are my property.

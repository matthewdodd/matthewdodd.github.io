WILLIAM BARDWELL.
I am a fireman. On the 29th of May I was at the prosecutor's house, where I lodge, between five and six o'clock in the evening I went into the cellar, and heard some one there—I looked, and saw the prisoner bringing a hamper from one end of the cellar to the front, and place it on an ale-barrel, and then on a butt—he then opened the cellarflap, and put the hamper of wine out on the pavement—I went up, and asked Mrs. Fairn if she had any one at work in the cellar—she said, "No"—I asked her to go out, she did, and I found the basket—the prisoner was still in the cellar—he had not seen me—he was taken when he came up out of the cellar, by the door—I am sure he is the person.





BENJAMIN WOOD
(City police-constable, No. 526.) I was in Towerstreet—Mrs. Fairn sent for me—I went to the house, and took the prisoner in front of the bar—I saw the hamper—it was full of bottles of wine.





STEPHEN HENRY FAIRN.
I keep the house. I saw the hamper—it contained sixteen bottles of wine, which were mine—I know the prisoner by his bringing bottles from time to time—he had no business in the cellar—he had forced the staple from the cellar, and knocked it in.

Prisoner. I am not guilty.




GUILTY.Aged 17.—

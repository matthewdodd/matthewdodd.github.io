JOHN HARDING
, 

stealing 1 coat, value 1l.; the goods of 



John Hackney: having been before convicted.






JOHN HACKNEY
. I am a tailor, at 3, South wick-street, Clerkenwell. On 6th Jan. about half-past 9 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I could make him a coat by the Saturday, and gave his name John Wilkinson, of 45, Rahere-street, Goswell-road, from where I was to fetch the cloth—I measured him, and he then asked to see some patterns for trowsers; I showed him some, bat he did not choose any—I had to torn my back to get them—he then left, and I shortly after missed my own coat from a hook behind the door, where I had seen it safe just before he came in—no one but him had been in the shop—I went to Rahere-street, but could find no such person there—I never saw the coat again, or the prisoner, till he was in custody.





MARY PALMER
. I am the wife of Thomas Palmer. On 21st Jan. the prisoner came, and asked to see my husband; he was not at home, and the prisoner wrote his address for my husband to call on him—I hare not got the address here—after he was gone, I missed my husband's coat—this old one (produced) was left in its place.





JOHN MOSS
 (policeman, 225 P). I took the prisoner.





GEORGE SMITH
 (City-policeman, 174). I produce a certificate—(read—Central Criminal Court; William Harding convicted, Sept. 1842; T Transported for ten years)—I was present; the prisoner is the man—I have had him before three times in custody.

Prisoner. I am not the party. Witness. I have not the least doubt he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 31.—George Devereaux, officer of Bridewell, stated that the prisoner had been confined there seven times for felony—

Transported for Seven Years.—There were two other indictments against the prisoner.

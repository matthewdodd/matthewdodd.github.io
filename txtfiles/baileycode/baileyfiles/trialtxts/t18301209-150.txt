            . I live in Oxford-street


, and keep a hardware warehouse

 - my sister Elizabeth is in partnership with me. We lost a basket on the 1st of December, from under the window, just outside the shop; I had seen it perhaps half an hour before - the prisoner was brought back with it.

            . I am porter to Mr. Watkins, an oilman. I was going up Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner take this basket - I ran, and stopped him with it.

            . I took the prisoner - he said he took the basket to pay for his lodging at No. 16, Church-street, St. Giles'; I went, but could not find that he lodged there.

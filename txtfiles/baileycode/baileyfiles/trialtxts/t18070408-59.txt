; the prisoner was cook
 in the house; the sheets were not missed till they were found on her; she was going out of the house and leaving the service at the time Mr. Thwaites insisted upon searching her pockets; upon searching her pockets I discovered the sheets, and she had about four pound of roast beef in her pocket, it was her pockets that stuck out and that was the occasion of her being searched; the sheets were pinned round her person.
(The property produced and identified.)
Prisoner's Defence. I have sent for my clothes and they will not let me have them.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.

. I saw the prisoner coming out of our house with this pail - I asked her what she did with it - she said it was her own - I said it was mine, and she must go back with it - she said she would not; I might take it back myself - she then said she had stolen it, but it was the first time she had ever done so.
Prisoner. I throw myself upon your mercy. I was in great want.

             and his Wife were left in the House, in Denmark Street, to take care of it till it was Let. About 4 in the Morning the Watchman seeing a Light in the fore Parlour, had some suspicion of Thieves, and knocking at the Door alarmed Wallington, who got up, and upon search they found the Drawers open, the Goods laid on the Floor ready to pack up, and the Prisoner hid under the Kitchen Stairs, with a Candle newly extinguish'd, the Key of the Street Door, and Seven picklock Keys in his Pocket. The Prisoner in his Defence, said, that he pick'd up a Whore, who carry'd him into this House; that he lay with her on the Stairs, and afterwards fell asleep, so that he could not tell what became of her. The Jury found him 


               guilty of Felony only
            .

            . On the 25th of February, I let the truck to the prisoner, at 3d. per hour - He promised to return it at three o'clock. I did not see it till my husband found it on the Monday following. I am sure the prisoner is the man.

            . I am a laundress. I heard Leach let the truck to the prisoner, at 3d. per hour, and saw the prisoner take it away there was another man with him - They both laughed, and said, it was just the thing.

            . I live in Hatton-Wall. The prisoner and another man came to me, saying, they had a truck to sell. I went with them to Hatton Wall, and saw it. I said it was too small - They said they were in distress, and would thank me to buy it-he wanted 2l. for it - I gave him 1l., and asked him his address, which he gave me, but it turned out to be fictitious. Leach claimed it.

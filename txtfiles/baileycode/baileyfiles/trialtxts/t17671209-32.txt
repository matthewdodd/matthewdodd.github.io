            . I am wife of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Alkins 
               



            ; we keep a public-house
 in George-street;

                  Redman 
               



             came to live servant
 with us the 1st of May, I had no opportunity to go for her character; on the 3d of May, in the evening, she went away, and the next morning I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; the things were in the trunk in a little back parlour; the money were six crown pieces, twelve half crowns, and 2 l. 8 s. in new shillings, all coined in the year 1758; I believe I put the money in the trunk the very day she came; I think the trunk was locked, but I cannot be sure; I had her from Jenkins's office; I went there to enquire after her, but they took no notice of it; the old woman at the bar was at our house on the Sunday the girl was there; the girl pretended the woman was her cousin, and she came on pretence to bring the girl some linen; the girl was taken up about three weeks or a month ago, I saw her at Sir John Fielding's office; she did not seem to know me, and said she knew nothing of the things: after that I went to her in prison; then she told me some of my things were sold at Islington to Mrs. Henry, and some to

            , and that the old woman helped her to sell them; we have found all the things but the money, and two pair of ruffles, and a plain muslin apron.

            . I was at the prosecutor's house, and saw Mrs. Alkins open the trunk, and saw the things in it the Sunday before the girl went away.

                  Henry 
               



            . I am a gardener's widow, I live at Islington, the old woman at the bar has chaired for me some years; she came and asked me if I knew any body that wanted such things, for the gentlewoman that wanted to sell them was in distress; I told her I would give her 15 s. for what she brought, which I did, and after that I was told I had given too much; I met her in the street, and told her so, so she gave me 4 s. back. I always took the girl to be the old woman's daughter.

                  Gillyland 
               



            . I live in Clerkenwell, the old woman came to me, and told me there were things to be sold, so I bought them of the girl; the old woman is mother to the girl; I bought them about four or five months ago; they had been in pawn two months to a pawnbroker in Jerusalem-court, St. John's-square; the old woman said she would send her daughter to me, to go with me to the pawnbroker; the daughter came; I asked her how her mother came by such things as laced aprons and laced ruffles; she told me her mother, in her young days, kept a milliner's shop, and they were remnants that she had at that time; they were brought down, the girl paid the interest; I looked at them, and would not buy them till she went and told her mother what I would give; then she came and told me I might have them; after that the pawnbroker made me pay the interest again, so I paid double interest for them (the two parcels produced and deposed to.)
Redman's defence.
I went to live at this gentleman's house; there was a milk-woman that was reduced in the world, bid me take these things away (this woman by me did not;) I took them away; I am but fifteen years of age.
Layton's defence.
I never knew nothing of it till a woman came to me, and said, Mrs. Layton, you work in very good houses, I am promised something for selling these things; after that, that woman summonsed me to the Court of Conscience for the money, the girl knows it very well; the girl had no place of succour to come to, but to my house; I do not know nothing of that woman more than I do of my dying hour, it was this girl that sent her to me; the girl is not my daughter, neither is she any relation.
Layton called

There was another indictment against Redman for stealing goods, and Layton for receiving the same, &c.
They were both committed to Newgate in August; Redman for stripping two infants, and Layton for receiving the clothes, and discharged in September sessions, the prosecutor not appearing.

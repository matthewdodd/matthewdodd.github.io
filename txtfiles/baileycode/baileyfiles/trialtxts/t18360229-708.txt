JAMES STILES
. I am the son of William Stiles, who lives at No. 13, Boswell-court, Queen-square, and is a green-grocer. On the 10th of February, between the hours of one and two, I saw the prisoner near my father's shop, and heard a noise in the street; my mother got up and looked out, and saw the boy in the court—she found the till was gone, and ran after him—he ran across the road and put the till down just as he took it—he had had it under his arm—I lost sight of him, as I stopped and picked up

the till—I then tried to look after him immediately, but he got away—he was not taken till the next day—I had known him before, and am sure it was him—the till contains a pair of scales and two cork-screws, and about 3s. 8d. in copper—one shilling and one sixpence.





WILLIAM STILES
. I am owner of this till. I did not see the transaction—I was not at home that day—the till was behind the counter—the prisoner must have crawled round on his knees.





SAMUEL BECKNELL
. I was going past the bottom of the court, and saw the prisoner with the till under his arm, and another boy with him.





JOHN ANSHAW BURKETT
. I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner into custody.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

1595. 




JOHN CORDWELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of April, 2 pairs of shoes, value 2s.; the goods of 



George Lowe; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLOTTE LOWE
. I am the wife of George Lowe—we keep a clothes-shop in Union-street, Lisson-grove—on the 22nd of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, the putty was cut away from a square in the window—it was broken before—we heard the crack, and the glass was poshed in, but nothing was taken away—it was put back again; and the next day, at a quarter before four o'clock, I caught the prisoner with his arm in at the same place in the window—he took out these two pairs of shoes, and put them in his other hand—he put his arm in again to take more, but I collared him—he dropped these shoes on the area—he said he hoped I should forgive him—these are my husband's shoes.





WILLIAM HOLDER
 (police-constable E 100.) The prisoner and the shoes were given to me—he begged for mercy.

Prisoner. I am guilty of being with the boy, but I am innocent of taking them.





WILLIAM CROUCHIR
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was at that time in the police, and was present at his trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years—Parkhurst.

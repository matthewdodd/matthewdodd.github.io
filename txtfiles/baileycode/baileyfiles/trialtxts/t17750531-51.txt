            . Last Thursday was a week, I was coming down Holborn-hill


. I stopped to make water; buttoning up the flap of my breeches, the prisoner came to me, and asked me where I was going; I said home; I felt her hand immediately snatch the watch-out of my pocket; I laid hold of her directly, and charged the watch with her. I did not find the watch upon her; I saw it at the justice's next day.
The watch was produced in court by Evans, and deposed to by the prosecutor.

            . I received the watch of 
               
                  John
                   Hyde
               



            ; I have kept it ever since; I stopped him on suspicion of stealing it.

            . I had the watch of 
               
                  Ellen
                   Davis
               



            .


                  Ellen
                   Davis
               



            . I found the watch on a bench by Gray's-inn-gate.
Q. to the prosecutor. Was you sober at the time?
Prosecutor. Yes. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took my watch; I felt her hand take it out of my pocket; there was nobody so near me as the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going down Holborn, I saw the prosecutor standing, and three woman round him; the women ran away, and he laid hold of me, and asked me if I had his watch; I said no. He said he would keep me till I found the other three women. He took me to the watch house, and they were going to search me, but he said there was no need, for the other women has the watch.
The prosecutor denied any such thing passing.



               Guilty

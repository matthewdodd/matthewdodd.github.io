            . I am eleven years old, and live with my father and mother at Chelsea. On the 13th of February I was in my father's bed-room, and saw my little brother Frederick run round the house into College-place



; he had his cap on then; the two prisoners followed him -I saw Herbert take the cap off his head, give it to Giles, and they both ran off together down John-street; I went and told my father - he told the Police-constable; they were taken about eleven o'clock at night - I know theyare the same persons; I observed them for a quarter of an hour at the window - the cap has never been found.


                  FREDERICK 
                  JARRETT
               



            . I am eight years old. I went out; Herbert took my cap off, and gave it to the other -I am sure they are the men; I have not found the cap.


                  JOSEPH 
                  JARRETT
               



            . I am the father of these two boy
s. I did not see the prisoners near my house; my sons described them, and recognized them the same night.

            . I am an officer. The mother of these lads described the prisoners to me: I took Herbert at the corner of Manor-street, King's-road - he behaved very well; I took Giles in the Lord Nelson public-house, a little before ten o'clock - I have not been able to find the cap; Herbert bears an excellent character from his late master.

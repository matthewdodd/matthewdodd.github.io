            . I am a waggoner
. On the 16th of November last, about twelve o'clock in the middle of the day; I was at a public-house in Spitalfields market


. At first the prisoner took a one-pound note, and then made an attempt to take my pocket-book, but I baulked him, and afterwards he took it out unknown to me.

            . I keep the public-house in which this took place. I heard there was gambling in the tap-room, and I went in, and stopped it, and then they were disputing about a one-pound note; there were two men and a woman in the room. I closed the door, and said nobody should quit the room until it was known who had got the note, and then the prisoner signified that he had got it; after that he denied that he had it a great many times, and so I sent for an officer. After that the pocket-book was missing. I understood that a man and his wife had gone out of the room. Armstrong searched the prisoner; but could find nothing upon him. The prisoner requested to be searched, nothing was found on him.

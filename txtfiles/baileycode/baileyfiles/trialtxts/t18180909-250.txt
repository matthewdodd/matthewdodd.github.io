WILLIAM MASON. I am a clerk
 in the Adjutant-General's Office. On the 6th of July, at eight o'clock at night, I was in Crawford's-passage, Clerkenwell


 - I felt a jerk at my pocket, turned round, and seized the prisoner. No other person was with him. A gentleman came up, and said he saw him throw my handkerchief on the ground - I then saw it lying about a yard from him - He begged forgiveness. As I was taking him to the office, he made a great resistance. I was obliged to put him in the watch-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

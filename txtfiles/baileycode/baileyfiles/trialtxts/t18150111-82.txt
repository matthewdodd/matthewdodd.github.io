            . I am a coal-metre.
Q. On the 19th of April last, did you measure any coals to be delivered at the palace - A. Yes, I did not know where they were to go to: I measured eighteen sacks to go to Mr. Marrabone, out of Mr. Wood's stock; 
               
                  James
                  Maybank
               



             was the carter
 to convey these coals; he drived the team, his name was inserted in the ticket as the carman; I saw him drive out of the dock.
Q. Do you know Fox - A. Yes; he is the backer of the gang, he assisted in loading; it is common for other men to go with the waggons in the course of the day, and only the carman's name is inserted in the ticket. On that day I saw Maybank drive out of the dock; I did not see him in the street, whether he went with the waggon I do not know, nor whether any other man went for him; his name was in the bill as the carman. I gave Maybank this ticket in his hand, he drove out as the car-man.

            . I am clerk in the house of Wood and Co. the names of the partners




 are Edward Wood, 
               
                  Richard
                  Wood

            , they are all the partners in that firm. I produce the book with the entry of the coals; the carman took out eighteen sacks to the stable-yard, St. James's, and twelve sacks to Burr-street; I have also it signed by Maybank, as the carman, his charge is eighteen-pence for shooting; he worked until the 22nd, and then he absconded. On the day the coals were taken out, they were five shillings and sixpence a sack; this sort of coals were sixty-six shillings a chaldron; they were the best coals the carman's name is signed on the ticket, he afterwards signs the book; we send one man, he may take another. Fox was a backer; we owed the prisoner one pound for shooting when he absconded; he never called for it.

            . I have an apartment in St. James's Palace; Mr. Marrabone lives next door to me. On the evening of the 19th of April, I recollect seeing a coal waggon come into the stable-yard, it was near six o'clock; I happened to be looking out of the window; I saw the coals unloading; there were two or three sacks emptied; I saw the man moving the sacks from the front to the tail, he knocked two sacks down, and the coals fell into the street; he put some empty sacks down in the street; I cannot say how many; I then thought there was something wrong, and I watched the counting of the sacks; they counted eighteen, part of them were empty; I watched the waggon; they drove to Maddox-street, they stopped at Mr. Hill's door, in Maddox-street, it is a cook's shop, in Maddox-street, and a private house in Swallow-street, it is a corner house; the waggon pulled up to the private door; I thought the man in the waggon suspected me, I went two or three doors further; they went into the house with two sacks; I saw them come out as if they had taken more; the waggon moved on towards Burr-street, Golden-square; on my seeing Hill in his house. I went, and asked Mr. Hill if Messrs. Wood, were his coal-merchants; he said, no. I said you have had some coals in; he said, he had four sacks out of the waggon, Mr. Wood was not his coal-merchant; he said, the man came into his shop, and said he had some coals to sell, he bought four sacks of him. I told him he had done a wrong act, and he would get into trouble about it. The next day I told Mr. Marrabone of it, and afterwards Mr. Wood was acquainted with it; Mr. Wood sent the metre to measure them; they measured only fourteen sacks, instead of eighteen; they were four sacks deficient, including them that had been burned. I cannot tell who the carman was, whether it was the prisoner or any other man; this happened on the 19th of April.
MR. M'CALLAH. I am one of the Westminster coal-metres. In April last, I measured some coals in Mr. Marrabone's apartments. I saw his servant, she told me how many she had used; they turned out to be fourteen sacks, and no more.
THOMAS PACE. I am an officer. I apprehended Maybank on the 25th of November; there was a warrant against Hill, he came directly to the office; he was bailed out, and surrendered to day.

            . I am servant to Mr. Marrabone. I remember the coals coming in; soon after Mr. Amos told my master something, or else he would not have known it; I used no more scuttles of coals than four only; the scuttle is about half a bushel; I told the metre how many I had used.
Maybank's Defence. I was very ill, I employed a man to do my work, and that is the occasion of this happening; I was not able to do my work; I signed the book, and got another man to do my work.
Maybank called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.
Hill said nothing in his defence; called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.

JOHN BLAKEWAY. I am a wine-merchant
, and live in Mark-lane. On the 10th of September, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I was on London-bridge


 - I had just used my handkerchief, and placed it in my outside coat pocket - when I felt a pull at the pocket and found it was gone, I turned round, saw the prisoner running off, seized him, and charged him with taking my handkerchief; I shook him - his coat opened, and it fell from under his coat behind his back; an officer came up and secured him - the handkerchief has my initials on it; he appeared in great distress.

            . I am warder of London-bridge. I was at the foot of the bridge - I saw a crowd run across, and the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing his handkerchief, which he delivered to me; I searched, but found nothing on him; he begged the prosecutor not to hurt him, as it was his first offence; he is not known at the offices at all.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.

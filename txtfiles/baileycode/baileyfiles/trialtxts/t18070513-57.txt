            . I am a Thames police officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of May, in Butcher-row, East Smithfield; I told her I apprehended her for taking this property from Phillips; she acknowledged to me that she did take them; she said she pledged them at Mr. Levi's in East Smithfield. I found them there.

            . I was near Aldersgate


, speaking to one of the militia; several people were near me; I thought I felt something at my right-hand side; I catched fast hold of the prisoner's shoulder with my left-hand, and said, you villain, you have been very busy with my pocket, you have got my handkerchief; he went on his knees, and unbuttoned the flap of his breeches, and pulled my handkerchief out, and gave it me, and begged I would let him go; (produced and deposed to.) The mob wanted to duck him, but I took him to a public-house, and after that, before a magistrate, and he was committed.
Prisoner's defence.
I picked it up from the ground, and put it in my breeches, having never a pocket.

 for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



William Marchant, on the 
2nd of January, at 
St. Giles-in-the-fields, and stealing therein I watch, value 1l., his goods.






WILLIAM MARCHANT
. I am a jeweller, and live in St. Giles's—it is my dwelling-house. On the 2nd of January, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, and heard three or four heavy thumps at the window, and then a smash—it is very thick plate glass—I went out immediately, and saw the prisoner running across the road from my shop window—he ran against an old woman, knocked her down, and I caught hold of the skirts of his coat—he fell himself—after he was brought back a boy picked up a watch close by, and brought it into the shop—I gave him in charge—the watch must have dropped from the prisoner—there was no other person running—this is it, it is mine—I found the window smashed to atoms, so as to allow a hand to be put in and take the watch—a great quantity of jewellery was dragged out on the pavement, which I afterwards picked up.





DENNIS RYAN
. I live in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. I was in High-street, St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's window—I heard glass break, looked to see who it was, and saw the prisoner standing by the window—the prosecutor came out—the prisoner ran—the prosecutor halloed "Stop thief'—the prisoner in running knocked down an old woman—she dropped a bag—I went to pick it up, and under it found the watch—it must have come from the prisoner.





JAMES SHEEN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody—he had been drinking—he was not sober.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Justice Maule.

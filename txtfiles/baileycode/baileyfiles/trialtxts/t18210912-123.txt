            , who lives in Suffolk-place, Lower-road, Islington


. On the 2d of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I put this beef and suet in the area safe, and missed it next morning. I saw it at Bow-street, on Monday the 3d - it is exactly like the beef, but I can swear to the suet.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, I met the prisoners at the back of Scott's-place, Lower-road, they saw me, and went up Queen-street. I sent my man up one street, I went round another way and secured them. Stephens had a bag with the beef and suet in it. I asked where they got it, they said nothing, and we took them to the office - they were in company.

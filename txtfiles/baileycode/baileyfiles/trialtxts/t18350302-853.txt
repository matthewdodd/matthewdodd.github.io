WILLIAM BROWN
. I live with Mr. Edward Prior, No. 13, Finsbury-place. On Wednesday last, we had twenty-one umbrellas within our doorway—about a quarter past two o'clock, a person came in and asked if we missed any—I ran out, and missed them—I inquired which way the boy had gone, and ran about two hundred yards down the street, when I saw the prisoner with these umbrellas on his shoulder—I asked where he was going—he said a man had told him to fetch them—I asked him what man—he could not tell me, and I brought him back—these are our umbrellas.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. What time of day was this? A. A quarter past two o'clock—there were a number of persons passing—the prisoner came back with me at once.

Prisoner's Defence. A man asked me to do a iavour for him, and I said "Yes"—he said, "Go along on this side the way, and you will see some umbrellas, bring them to me"—I went and got them.




GUILTY

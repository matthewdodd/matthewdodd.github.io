                  Hivenson 
               



            . I met the prisoner with two bushels of coals in a sack, upon his back, in Thames-street, on the 3d of April.
Q. Which way was he going?
Hivenson. Towards Queenhithe.
Q. Had you known him before?
Hivenson. He worked at Mrs Louch's at that time: his business was to load coals for her at the wharf
; I turned him back and made him put them into the cart.
Q. Do you know where he took them from?
Hivenson. We suppose from out of a lighter.
Q. How do you know, but that he had an order to carry them for his mistress?
Hivenson. No, he had no order.
Q. What is the value of them?
Hivenson. They are valued at half a crown: he said he had never been guilty of such a thing before.
Q. Whose coals were they?
Hivenson. The sack was Mrs. Louch's, but the coals were not: she only had the carriage of them.
Q. Did you promise him forgiveness at the time he confessed this?
Hivenson. No, I did not.
Q. What are you?
Hivenson. I am servant to Mrs. Louch
Prisoner's Defence.
They were sweepings of a lighter, about a bushel or a little more, and I was going to carry them to a poor family.

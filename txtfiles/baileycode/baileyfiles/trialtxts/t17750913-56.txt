            . I am a pawn-broker, the prisoner pawned a silver cup with me in the name of 
               
                  William
                   Morris
               



            .

            . I am a servant to Mr. Tulet, who is a clock-maker. The prisoner used to call and enquire for my master, who during the summer season lay out of town. On the morning before the cup was missing he brought a clock to clean; he went into the kitchen, the cup was kept near the kitchen door; it was about seven in the morning I believe; it was the 22d of August; the cup was missed afterwards.
Prisoner's Defence.

            , a tailor
, who lives in Bentinck-street. On the 12th of August, about eight o'clock at night, I was taking this coat and waistcoat to Mr. Winford, Searle's Coffee-house, at the corner of Carey-street; I saw the prisoner and another man; I asked them the way to Searle's Coffee-house, they said lower down. I went on and asked a gentleman who stood at a door. They came up and said they were going there, and would show me. At the corner of Hemlock-court


, the prisoner touched his companion's arm, then snatched my bundle, and ran down the court. I hallooed Stop thief! and the prisoner was taken in three minutes with it.

MARY STEWARD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of February, I sovereign, the monies of 



John Thompson, from his person.






JOHN THOMPSON
. I am a sailor, and lodge at Goodman's, in Angelgardens. On Saturday, the 26th of February, I was coming down the highway about eleven o'clock at night—I had two sovereigns in my hand, and some silver—I was counting it in my hand—the prisoner was coming by and took a sovereign out of my hand, and walked or ran away, I do not know which—the officer afterwards took me to a house, where I saw her, and charged her with it.

Prisoner. On Monday, after going before the Magistrate, he came to me, and said, "If you will give me half a sovereign, I will be content with it"—I told him I did not have the sovereign—he said, had I any friend who would make up half-a-sovereign for him—he has had 7s. 6d. in part payment of it. Witness. I have got 7s. 6d. back again—I never saw her before.





FRANCIS WILLIAM SMITH
. I live with Mr. Marshall, a butcher, in High-street, Shad well. I saw the prosecutor stop at the stall-board and count his money—the prisoner took one sovereign out of his hand, and

asked him for the other—he said, "No, no; give me that one," and she directly ran away with it—she lives up Twine-court—I am certain she is the woman.

Prisoner. Q. Did I take it out of his hand? Witness. He was taking it off the board—he had it in his fingers, and you took it.





EDWARD KENNEDY
 (police-constable K 218.) In consequence of information from Smith, I went to a house in Twine-court, about a quarter to one o'clock, and found the prisoner—I did not find the sovereign.




GUILTY* of stealing only. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN POLLARD SEARLE
. I am a tailor, and live in Brick-lane, St. Luke's. This is my cloth—it was safe on an iron rod by the door, in the evening of the 31st of July, and about eleven o'clock at night, I missed it—about an hour after the policeman came, and asked if I had lost any thing—I said I had—he showed me a ticket, which was the one that had been on the cloth—it is 2 1/2 yards of doeskin.





WILLIAM STEWART
 (police-constable G 133.) I saw the prisoner carrying this cloth—he was about ten minutes' walk from the prosecutor's—I met him coming down Compton-street—I asked what he had got under his arm—he said, "Washing"—I said, I should feel satisfied if I saw it—he said I should, if I would go to Seward-street—I said no, he must go with me to the Rosoman-street station—he walked a little way, and ran off—I pursued and took him in Compton-passage—a person picked up the cloth, and gave it to me—I found the ticket on it—I made inquiries, and found the prosecutor.

Prisoner. I had been out of work some months, and my mother was dying of consumption in St. Luke's workhouse.

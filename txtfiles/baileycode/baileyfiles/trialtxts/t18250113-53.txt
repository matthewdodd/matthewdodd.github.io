             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 21st of December

                        Simeon 
                        Brown

            . I conduct Mr. Simeon Brown's business - he is a linen-draper
, and lives in Holborn


. I saw the three prisoners come into our shop on the 21st of December - Mary Davis wanted to purchase a yard of cambric muslin, which came to 1 s. 2 d.; they all three stood in a row, one behind the other. They were afterwards going away, and Savage said her skirt was loose; this made me suspect they had taken something. I went round the counter, and took from her person a piece of Norwich crape - I then looked on the counter, and found it had been taken from there - it was worth 11 s. I had seen the prisoners in the shop twice the day before, and another person with them. Mary Davis had been about five minutes making her purchase. Our shop is much frequented, but there were not many persons there.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take the prisoners.

             and 
               
                  
                     Mary 
                     Lewis 
                  



                
             of Twittenham



 , were indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Cloth Coat value 5 s. the Goods of 
                     
                        
                           William 
                           Beck 
                        



                      
                  , out of the Shop of the said William Beck
            , on the 16th of October

 last.
They were a second time indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Cloth Coat value 4 s. 6 d.
             the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Joseph 
                     Hassel 
                  



                
            , on the 16th of October

 last.
It appeared that the Prosecutor Mr. Beck was inform'd by a Neighbour that Lewis had taken a Coat out of his Shop, whereupon he sent his Apprentice (Francis Lamb) after the Prisoners, who overtook them, and found his own Coat, and another and a Wastcoat in Raven's Bag . Mr. Hassel was sent for and owned the other Coat which was found in Raven's Bag. 


               But there being a Mistake in the first Indictment, it being therein laid to be the Goods of William Beck, and proved to be the Property of Francis Lamb, the Jury Acquitted them both of that
            ; and the Evidence not affecting Lewis in the second Indictment, the Jury 

               Acquitted
             her of that also, and found Raven 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d

. The prisoner came to my house on the 2d of December, and slept there two nights - on the 4th of December she said she was going to a situation; on that evening I went out, and on my return she was gone: I missed the tea-board and sheet: the sheet was Weetman's - it was dirty in the cupboard that morning; the tea-board was mine, and hung in the room at tea time.

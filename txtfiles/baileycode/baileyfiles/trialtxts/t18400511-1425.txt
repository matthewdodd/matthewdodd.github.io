ALFRED HUGHES
. I am a policeman. On the 1st of May, about a quarter past two o'clock, I was in the Edgware-road—a boy fetched me to the prosecutor's shop—I found the prisoner close against the street-door, endeavouring to get out, and Mrs. Allcock holding him by the collar—I took hold of him—he resisted—I took him into the parlour, and he struck me several times in the mouth—another constable came in and we took him to the station-house—on the way he said he was b—well sure they would lag him for it—I said, "Perhaps you will get discharged"—he said, no he knew better than that.





SARAH ALLCOCK
. I am the mother of Frederick Allcock. This is his coat—it laid on the bureau—I was in the front kitchen at work—I went up to speak to my little boy, and as I returned I saw the prisoner standing in the kitchen with the coat in his hands—he saw me, dropped it, and went up stairs—I followed him into the passage, and detained him while my daughter went for the policeman, who took him—he was quite a stranger.

(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was very much in liquor at the time; that his skull had been fractured, and when intoxicated he was not in his senses.)





ALFRED HUGHES

re-examined. He was perfectly sober.

MRS. ALLCOCK
re-examined. He appeared intoxicated when I first detained him, but I am not able to say whether he was so or not—he went up stain very well.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

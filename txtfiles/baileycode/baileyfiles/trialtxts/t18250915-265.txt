            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Attenborough, a pawnbroker, of Crown-street, Finsbury. - About half-past four or five o'clock on the evening of the 26th of July, the prisoner brought these breeches to pawn, which he said belonged to his brother, in Long-lane - I had my suspicions, and sent for an officer; he then said he saw a man running with them, and drop them.

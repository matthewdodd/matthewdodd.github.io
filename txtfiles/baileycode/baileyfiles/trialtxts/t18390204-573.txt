William Samuel Laming.






WILLIAM SAMUEL LAMINO
. I live at Kingston. On the 8th of November I left a portmanteau at the Angel Inn, in Farringdon-street—it was fetched away on the Saturday following—I observed that the catch of the lock had been affected, and I missed from the portmanteau a shirt, a pair of shoes, and the other articles stated in the indictment, which were worth at the lowest estimate 2l. 13s. 6d.—I went to the Angel, and found my shirt on the prisoner's back—he was under-ostler there.





JOHN CLARKE
. I was one of the City police. On the 4th of January

I took the prisoner at the Angel yard—he was acting there as a servant—he denied the robbery—the prosecutor then asked him to let him look at his shirt—I took him into the stable, and the prosecutor identified this shirt, which was on the prisoner's back—the prisoner said it was his own—the other things were mentioned, and he said he knew nothing about them—but on the Thursday following, as we were going to Guildhall, he said, if the prosecutor would not appear against him he would make the things all right.

Prisoner. I said, rather than be scandalised, I would pay him for what he had lost, if he would not appear against me.





WILLIAM SAMUEL LAMING
. This is my shirt, and was in my port-manteau—I know it by the mark W. S. L. No. 8.—my brother brought the portmanteau from the Angel on the Saturday, and it remained in his possession till the following Tuesday—I found the hasp had been wrenched off, but the straps were buckled down, and no one would know it had been opened till they were taken off.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

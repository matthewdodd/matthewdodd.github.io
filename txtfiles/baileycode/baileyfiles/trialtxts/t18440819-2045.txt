 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 



John Helme, from his person j and that he had before been convicted of felony.






JOHN HELME
. I am a solicitor. A little after nine o'clock, in the evening of the 24th of June, I was walking up Holborn-hill, and just as I stepped off the curb to cross Hatton-garden, I felt a pull, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner pass up Hatton-garden, with both his hands in front, which excited my suspicion—in less than two seconds I saw him put my handkerchief into his pocket—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said he had something that did not belong to him—he ran away up Hatton-garden—he was pursued by a policeman in plain clothes, and was taken, just entering Charles-street, to go to Saffron-hill—he begged my pardon.





HENRY THOMAS JACKSON
 (police-constable G 192.) I saw the prisoner running, and I pursued him—I saw him throw the handkerchief from him—I still followed, and took him—he wanted to get down to Saffron-hill—the prosecutor came up and identified him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at work that evening; I was only liberated from prison on the 17th of June.





THOMAS BROWN
 (City police-constable, No. 215.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

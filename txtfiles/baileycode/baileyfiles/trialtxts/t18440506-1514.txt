MR. COBBETT
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN GOSS FLEAY
, draper, Broadway, Deptford. On Sunday, the 14th of April, the prisoner was in my service—I was sent for to the police station that day, and found him there in custody, and the articles stated were shown me by the policeman—they are mine, and have my private mark on them—the prisoner had 30l. per annum, and boarded in my house—he was with me about three weeks—I never allowed him to take anything on approbation—the value of the property is between 5l. and 6l.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Your own writing is on all the goods? A. Yes—I never let him have goods at the wholesale price—I have sold goods to my shopmen at the retail price, if they wanted goods for themselves; but I never allowed one man to serve another, nor to serve themselves—I swear I never sold these.





JOHN BOVIS
 (policeman.) On Sunday, the 14th of April, I was watching for the prisoner at Deptford—I saw him about eight o'clock in the morning, with a carpet bag, within thirty yards of the prosecutor's house—I followed him to the railway terminus at London-bridge—I went'by the same rain with him, took him into custody, and asked him what the bag contained—he said, "Dirty linen"—I said, "Anything else?"—he said, "Yet, a piece of linen," which I found—the other constable took the bag—he said nothing about having them on approbation.





JOHN WHITE
 (policeman.) I was with Bovis—I took the carpet bag, and found this property in it——I showed it to Mr. Fleay that morning when he came to the station.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

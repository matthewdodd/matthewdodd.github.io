 at the Fair; there was a very great crowd of people collected together, and presently I felt a tap on the shoulder, and on looking round saw the prisoner in custody of the officer Lyons, who told me he had picked my pocket, and produced my handkerchief to me.

            . I am an officer. I was at Stepney Fair on the 16th of April; as soon as I entered the Fair, I saw the prisoner and two other well known characters very busy, they made several attempts, but without success, and at last they fixed on the prosecutor; one placed himself on his right hand, another on the left, and the prisoner in the centre behind; as soon as they so placed themselves, they made a terrible push, and I directly saw the prisoner put a handkerchief into his bosom. I instantly seized him, and informed the gentleman he had been robbed.

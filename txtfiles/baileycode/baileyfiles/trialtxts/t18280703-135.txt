            . I am servant to Mr. Thomas Bunney of Golden-lane. I took out his child on the 1st of July, about three o'clock; I had seen the prisoner two or three times, and once before he had tried to get the necklace off the child's neck; I was in Chiswell-street


, and saw him behind me - there were some ladies and gentlemen getting into a carriage and I did not like to pass by: the prisoner came behind me and took off the necklace - I went directly to a pawnbroker's and found the prisoner there, trying to pawn it; an officer came in and I gave charge of him - this is the necklace - the child is one year and nine months old.
Prisoner's Defence. A little boy picked up the necklace at the side of a scraper - I asked him to give it me, which he did.

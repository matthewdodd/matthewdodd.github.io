Eliz. Tucker. I live in Aldgate High-street


, to assist a sister, and brother that keep a public house. I went into the club-room, that joins the tap-room, on the eleventh of January, in order to make up a fire to go to ironing. I heard a great ratthng at the sash in Harrow-alley: I went out at the door, and found that sash up. I missed the things; they were in a great earthen dish; the dish was gone also. I called out, I was robbed. The two prisoners were soon taken, and the things and dish brought back. (Produced in court.) They are the property of a gentleman, but were in my custody, and I was accountable for them had they been lost.

             pursued and took the prisoners with the things upon them, about three hundred yards distant, at the top of Aytiffe-street, and brought them back again. They immediately confessed to the taking the things.
Blunder in her defence said, she and Gould were together. They saw the sash open, and she went in and took the things.

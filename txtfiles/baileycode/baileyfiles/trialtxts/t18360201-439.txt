BARNETT LEVY
. I live in Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square. I was going down Snow-hill, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, on the 17th of January—I had a handkerchief in my pocket, which I had seen safe about two minutes before—I received information from a watchman, and found it had been stolen—this is it—it was shown to me by the witness.





WILLIAM PEARSE
. I am watchman to Messrs Boyd and French. At half past eleven o'clock that evening, I was on Snow-hill, and saw the prisoner walking down behind the gentleman, with the skirt of his coat in his hand—he drew the handkerchief out of his pocket and dropped it on the pavement—he was crossing the street, and I stopped him—he said, "What do you stop me for?"—I said, "You have picked the gentleman's packet"—I called the watchman, and gave him to him—a pot-boy picket up the handkerchief.





MICHAEL RYAN
. I was the watchman on duty. Pearse called me, and gave me the prisoner—this handkerchief was on the pavement—I called the prosecutor, who said it was his.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for seven years.

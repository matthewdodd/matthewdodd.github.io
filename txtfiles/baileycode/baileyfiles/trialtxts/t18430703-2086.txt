JAMES WIGAN
. I live in Robert-street, Bedford-row. About elevan o'clock, on the 19th of June, I was going up Holborn, and felt my pocket tried by a hand, and missed my pocket-book and other articles, which I had seen safe a few minutes before—I turned round, and found the prisoner clow at my back—there was nobody within five or six yards of him—I saw him suddenly walk lame, and go to the wall—I followed him to the corner of Leather-lane—he then recovered, and ran very swiftly, and I after him, and at the narrow part of the lane he communicated with a man in the corner-he then abruptly turned back, walked past me, and went on very slowly—I seized him, and gave him in charge—this is my pocket-book.





JOHN EVANS
 (policeman.) I took the prisoner in charge, went back to the part in Leather-lane pointed out by the prosecutor, and found the pocket-book and some letters.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down the lane, and a gentleman took hold of me, but I am as innocent as you are.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I am a sugar boiler at Mr. Bellinger's. On the 19th of November, about five in the evening, I saw the prisoner had his pockets full of sugar, and a small bag of sugar in his breeches. I asked him what he had got in his pockets; he said nothing. I took him before my master. The prisoner took the sugar from his pockets and breeches himself. altogether the sugar weighed fourteen pounds.

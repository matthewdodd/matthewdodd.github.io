            , who keeps a child-bed linen warehouse
, in Myddleton-street


, about ten minutes' walk from Walden's. On the 5th of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the three prisoners came into the shop together, to look at a cap and some lace; I took a cap from the window, to show them - they bought nothing, and all left together; they did not ask for muslin, but this piece was on the counter, within their reach, in a brown paper parcel; I missed it about twenty-five minutes after they left - nobody else had been in; I went to look after them, and saw them in custody in about half an hour, with the muslin divided into two parcels - it was all in one when they took it.
MRS. WALDEN. When Wright stopped Bray she gave him two parcels, which Johnson claimed.
WILLIAM WRIGHT. Bray delivered me two parcels, which Johnson claimed.(Property produced and sworn to.)
WILLIAM KING. I found one parcel on White, and the other was produced.



               The prisoners were all convicted
            . - 




               Transported for 7 Years
            .

WILLIAM ADAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of September, 1 shilling, 3 groats, 5 pence, 1 halfpenny, and 2 farthings, the monies of 



John Moore, his master.






JOHN MOORE
. I keep a beer-shop, in John's-row. The prisoner was my pot-boy—I gave him the money stated on Monday last, about twelve o'clock, to give change to persons who wanted it—he went out, and did not return—a gentleman where he left the tray came to me—I went, on Monday evening, to Sadler's Wells theatre, and found him there.





JOHN RUSSELL
 (police-constable G 165.) I found the prisoner at the theatre—I told him I wanted him for robbing his master of some money and beer—when he came in the presence of his master, he begged forgiveness, and said he would not do so any more.

Prisoner. My master sent me to get some customers—I got to Nelson-street, and a lady asked me to give her change for half-a-crown—I felt in my pocket, and I had lost three fourpenny pieces—I did not like to go back, thinking my master would be angry—I left the tray in a baker's-shop, and went to the theatre.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been four years and eleven months serving in a man of war; I got paid off; I went about, and lost all my money; a man came and said, "I can put you in a way to get a few shillings, take this out, and this pass, and I will give you 5s.;" I was taking it out, and was taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

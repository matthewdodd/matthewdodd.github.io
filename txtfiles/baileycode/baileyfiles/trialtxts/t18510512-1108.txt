FREDERICK JUDD
 was indicted

 for the wilful murder of 



Richard Judd; he was also charged on the Coroner's Inquisition with the like murder.


MESSRS. BODKIN
and
CLERK
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM RICE
. I am a cab-driver, and reside at 2, Garden-place, Bell-street, street, Westminster; the same house where the deceased Richard Judd resided—he rented it, and was my landlord—I had only lived in the house a fortnight when this occurrence took place—I knew the prisoner by sight, he was Richard Judd's son, and lived with him—there are two rooms in the house, I occupied the lower part, and Judd and the prisoner the upper—on Saturday morning, 12th April, between eight and nine, while I was in my room, I heard a scuffling up-stairs, for about a minute or two, and I heard a sort of moan after it was over—the prisoner then came down-stairs, and went

into the yard; went up-stairs again, came down again immediately, and went out—the deceased then came out, locked the door, and came down, and as he came down, I heard him make the same sort of moan—the right side of his face was covered with blood—he went out at the srarden-gate—I believe he had four other sons besides the prisoner—one of them afterwards came, and the deceased's brother's wife, and broke the door open—I went up, and the bed was all over blood, and the room also, in different parts—I saw a small shovel-handle in the room, about an inch and a half long, it had blood on it (produced), this is it—it has been broken—this poker (produced) was also in the room—I did not observe any blood upon that.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You mean there was a piece broken off, of about an inch or two? A. The shovel was broken off, and there was about half the length of my finger left, and there was blood on it—I did not speak to the deceased as he came down-stairs—my wife went out after him—I was not dressed at the time—I found blood in every part of the room—it seemed as if there had been a considerable struggle, and I had heard what appeared to be a great struggle between the two, the deceased Was quite dressed when he went out.





SARAH RICE
. I am the last witness's wife. I saw the deceased at the gate—Ilia face and head were covered with blood—he had a hat on—I went out after him into the street, and there was a person of the name of Larkin with him—I asked him where he was going, and he said to his son's—I went and got another son to come and see the father and the brother.





ANN LARKIN
. I live in Garden-place, Westminster. On the Saturday morning, I saw the deceased come out of his gate, and I went and assisted him along the street to Mr. Painter's, the doctor's—he was not at home, and I went with deceased to the Westminster Hospital—he walked there.





WILLIAM THOMAS PALMER
 (policeman, B 104). I was called to the Westminster Hospital, and saw Judd, who afterwards died there—I went to the room at 2, Garden-place, and saw one of the deceased'a sons there—I produce a nightcap and a tooth which I found—the nightcap hat blood on it and smut, as if from a poker—the deceased had lost a tooth.





MARK LOOME
 (policeman, B 11). I went in search of the prisoner on 12th April, and on the morning of 14th he came of his own accord to the station—he was charged with assaulting and wounding his father, who was then alive—he said his father had brought it all on himself—when he was before Mr. Broderip, the Magistrate, the same day, after being cautioned, he made a statement—it is stated in my second examination—it was taken down in a book by the clerk at the first examination—(MR. BODKIN
proposed to prove by the witness what the prisoner stated on that occasion.
MR. BALLANTINE
objected, as it was not returned in the depositions, and could only be proved by calling the clerk who took it down. The
COURT
allowed the objection)—I found this poker near the fire-place, and these clothes on the bed; they are covered with blood; and this pillow-case and handkerchief.
(The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read—"All I have to say is, that it was done accidentally.")





LEONARD GEORGE BOOR
. I was house-surgeon at Westminster Hospital when Judd was brought in—he was placed under my care—he was then sensible, and able to undress himself—when in bed I examined him, and found, on the right side of his head, two inches above the ear, a contused wound about four and a half inches long, the skull was fractured underneath, the bone slightly depressed; there was a similar wound, about an inch and a quarter long, just below it, behind the same far—there was a

wound extending from the right cheek bone, under the right cheek bone, towards the eye, at the inner angle of the eye to the bridge of the nose, and the bones of the nose on the left side were broken—there was a small flesh-wound on the cheek, over the canine tooth of the upper jaw, which penetrated into the mouth, the gum was lacerated, and the tooth gone—I examined the tooth that was found, and it was of the same sort that might have come from there—there were marks of a blow over the lower jaw, which was broken; and there were marks of a wound on the knuckle of the right-hand little finger—I think there could not have been less than three blows to produce the injuries I saw, there might have been four—they were such as might have been produced by a Heavy instrument, such as a poker—he was sixty-two years old—he continued under my care a fortnight, at the end of which time he died from the effects of the injuries.

COURT. Q. Which do you say was the fatal blow? A. The fracture of the skull—he answered questions when he first came, as to his name and age—after his death, I examined the body—I have no doubt his death was caused by the fracture and the consequences of the blows altogether on the system.

Cross-examined. Q. He was quite capable for the first three days of answering any questions you put to him? A. Yes, and in a state to give an account of how the matter happened—I asked him how it was done—he said he did not know, he was in bed at the time, but did not know—I repeated the question afterwards, and he evaded it—he seemed to have a great indisposition to answer questions of any kind.

Henry Hand, shoemaker, of 1, Bell-strtet, Vincent-square, and Henry Mould, cage-maker and wire-worker, deposed to the prisoner's good character.

CHARLES LAWTON
. I live in Upper Thames-street. On Saturday night, 2nd Sept., I was coming along Tooley-street towards London-bridge, and met the prisoner—she said, "How are you, my dear?"—I said, "Nicely"—she said, "Will you go along with me?"—I said, "No"—I did not see anybody with her—she immediately put her fingers to my throat, and while she had hold of me 1 received a blow under the ear, and fell—I received a kick under my rib, and another behind—a hand was put over my mouth, and I felt a hand go into my left trowsers-pocket, where I had two half-crowns—I had felt them just before, as I had my hand in my pocket when she met me—I was down a few minutes, and when J got up the prisoner was gone, and the half-crowns also—I gave information to the police, and went next night, Sunday, to an archway near London-bridge, where I saw the prisoner—I swear she is the person.

            . I live with Mr. Morgan, No. 30, Percy-street. On the morning of the 26th of September, I saw that the kitchen roof of the house in question was stript of the lead. We got into the house, and in the passage found the very piece of lead which was cut from the roof, and which fitted to it, which we marked; the last witness, the constable, and I were altogether. The copper and fixtures were all gone. We watched, expecting the person who cut the lead would call for it; and on the 28th, in the morning, about six o'clock, we saw the prisoner at the bar on the roof of the kitchen, and we took him into custody with the lead in question; then we took him to the watchhouse.

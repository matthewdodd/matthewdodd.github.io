WILLIAM BEDDOME. I am a woollen-draper
, and live in Fenchurch-street. On the 15th of June, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate


; a person behind said, "The lad who is running away has picked your pocket;" I immediately followed the prisoner, who was two or three yards from me, and never lost sight of him - he was stopped going into Cutler-street by an officer, and at that moment I saw my handkerchief at his feet; it is silk, and has my initials on it.
Prisoner. It is quite wrong, it was not near my feet.
JOHH PARKER. I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner, crying Stop thief! - nobody else was running away; he was coming towards me - I stopped him, collared him, and saw him drop the handkerchief at that moment; Mr. Beddome claimed it.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me throw it away? A. I saw you drop it the moment I collared you.
JOSEPH STONE. I am one of the City Police. The prisoner was given into my charge with the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was running along - somebody said Stop thief! I ran, this man stopped me, and accused me of it; I know nothing of it.

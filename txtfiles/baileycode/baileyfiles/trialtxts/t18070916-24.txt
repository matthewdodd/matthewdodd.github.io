            . I am a servant to Mr. Pearce. On the 2nd of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I found a piece of printed cotton furniture in the pantry below, stairs facing the kitchen; there was a flag stone put upon it, it was in a corner and I saw it by one of the corners of the furniture sticking out. I left it there.
Q. Did you at any time afterwards, see any thing done with it. - A. I was watching in the kitchen facing it; in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I heard a noise in the pantry; I saw the prisoner at the bar come and take the cotton into a long passage adjoining the pantry; I went into the shop and informed 
               
                  John 
                  Webb
               



            ; he came from the shop instantly, and took the cotton from him.
Q. How came the prisoner in the house. - A. He was employed in the house; the house was repairing; he was a plaisterer
.

             lives at 143, in the Strand, that is his dwelling house, they are all partners.
Q. In consequence of any information, that you received from the last witness, did you go down into the passage leading into the pantry. - A. I did; I went to the further end of the passage to the privy; on opening the door, the prisoner endeavoured to rush out; I stopped him and asked him what he had got in his apron; he answered nothing. I then endeavoured to take it from him, he made some resistance. I took a piece of printed cotton from his apron it belongs to Messrs. Ansley and Pearce; it is worth about three guineas.
Q. When did you see it last. - A. I cannot, say having many; it must have been taken from the shop.

            . I am goaler to the office at Marlbrough street. I apprehended the prisoner in Baldwyn's-gardens Gray's Inn-lane he made his escape from the house I apprehended him the same evening at eleven o'clock.
(The property produced and identified.)
Prisoner's Defence (read in court) My lord in the situation I now stand has brought distress upon me and my family, I can assure you lordship it never was my intention to commit any theft. Unfortunate for me I happened to be the person who found the printed cotton; when I found it I did not know what it was nor had I the least thought of taking it off the premises. I hope you will shew me that lenity that the nature of the case requires, if I am found guilty it will be the total ruin ofme and my family.

            . I am a truss-maker
, I live at 217, High Holborn


. On the 10th of November, between eight and nine in the evening, Trott the officer came to my house. On the 11th I went to Hatton-garden office, when Trott took me to his apartments, as I believe, where I saw the things stated in the indictment, that I verily believe to be my property. I have a man in court that made some of the things.

            . Q. You are an officer. - A. Yes; I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of November. I searched the room where he lodged, I sound these things, and knowing the prisoner worked for Mr. 
               Hughes
             I applied to him.
(The property produced and identified.)
Prisoner's Defence. About six weeks ago last Saturday, there was a young man called at my house; he left a parcel with my wife; when I came home I opened the parcel; the contents were five truss springs. I was to cover them; I have never seen or heard of him since.
The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

The prisoner was servant
 with the prosecutor, who is a founder
; one Stanton came to his house the 6th of April, and told him one of his servants had brought some brass to sell, some of it was not finished, and also a tool which founders use, to his master, one Newton, a founder in the Minories, and they had stopp'd him, that the prisoner said he had bought it of an old woman at Deptford for six pence; then Stanton examined his hands, and he appeared to be a founder, he denied that, but it was discover'd by a letter found in his pocket, with his name on it, and a direction; he would not tell where he lived: the prosecutor went to Mr. Newton, the prisoner owned it was his master's property, and that he took it that morning, and was sorry for it

The prisoner said in his defence, he never took any thing before.

            . I live in James-place, Marlborough-row, Chelsea. I was at the corner of Berners-street


 on the 30th of July, and saw this piece of cotton drop from the prosecutor's doorway - the prisoner took it up, put it under his coat, and ran away with it; I followed him, and gave him into custody - this is the cotton; I do not know what caused it to full.

            . I am a linen-draper
, and have one partner - we live at the corner of Berners-street; this is our property, and has our mark on it - I cannot account for its falling, but I am quite confident there must have been some hand applied to it.

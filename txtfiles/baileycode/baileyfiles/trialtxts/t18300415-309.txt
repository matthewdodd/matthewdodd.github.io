            . I keep a clothes-shop
, in Brook-street, Stepney



. On the 14th of April, about six o'clock, Carpenter came in, and asked for a pair of shoes - she had a child in her arms; I had seen her a number of times -I said I had no shoes; she said I had, and then Wood, who was quite intoxicated, and another person came in -I did not see Dillon to my knowledge; I was afraid of their doing some mischief, and I wished to get Wood out - the third person said she would get her out; they went out - Carpenter remained; I put my hand to her and said, "Come again by and by;" none of them bought any thing - I closed my door as I was going out, and the next morning I missed a jacket and a pair of trousers, which the officer has.

            . I keep a clothes-shop. On the morning after this Carpenter and Dillon came to my house, both very drunk, with this jacket and trousers on their arms - I told them to go off, and they did; I have no doubt this is the jacket by the buttons.

            . I apprehended Wood at her lodgings, on the morning of the 15th of April - and found this boy's dress there.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Wood's Defence, Carpenter had my child to nurse -I was at Greenwich fair on Sunday, Monday and Wednesday; I know not how the dress came in my place, but when Carpenter had words with her husband she used to make my place her own.
Carpenter's Defence. I do not remember being at Mrs. Bennett's: I might have been there, but I never saw the dress till I saw it at this woman's - I was intoxicated; I suppose I went to buy the shoes, but I do not know.

            ; he lives in Ratcliff-highway. I sent my little niece to the pawnbroker with two sheets and one blanket; one of the sheets is quite lost - I afterwards went to the pawnbroker, who gave me a description of Carpenter and Dillon; I went to Mr. Harris and said, "I had been robbed" - he said, "Of a sheet, Mrs. Brown?" I said, "Yes, how came you to know it?" he said, "Two women have been here drunk, and wanted to sell it;" I then went down a court and saw Carpenter looking out at a window - I said to her, "Have you seen my little girl?" she said Yes - I said"Have you taken any thing out of her basket?" she said, No - she came down, and I walked with her some time; at last she said she had had the sheet of Dillon; we went to Dillon, who said she had not had a sheet for months - I said if she would give it up, I would say no more about it.

            . Carpenter and Dillon came to myhouse intoxicated - I would not let them in; Mrs. Brown came to me and said, "If you go down Brook-street, you will see a dark woman;" Dillon did not come into the shop.

            . I took Carpenter, and asked her about the sheet which she had offered to Harris - she said it belonged to Dillon; they were both sitting drinking tea - I asked where it was; she said she would not tell me - on the way to the station Carpenter said if we could make up the money, she would not hurt us.
Carpenter's Defence. I went to the pawnbroker's, and the child stood back; there were many people - I took the child up, put the things out, and laid them on the table; they would not take my article in - I walked away; I had not another thing to pawn - the woman came and said I had robbed her child, but I had not; there were a great many people there, and I left the articles on the counter; I never was in prison in my life before.

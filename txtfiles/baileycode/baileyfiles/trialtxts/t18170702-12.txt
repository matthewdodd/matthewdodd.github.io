JOHN BURGESS. I am shopman to Mr. Cleobury, who is a clothier
, and lives in Cheapside


. On the 24th of May, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning. I saw the prisoner take the trowsers from the door, and put them into his apron - He then ran across the road, and through Bow-churchyard; I pursued, calling out stop thief! he took them out of his apron and threw them away. I secured him behind a cart in Cloak-lane, and am sure he is the boy. He stood at the door three or four minutes. I lost sight of him, but soon found him again - He was running. I picked the trowsers up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . The prisoner came to my shop in Finch-lane


, to look at some buckles; she held her head down so that her hat was between me and the buckles; I laid down three pair, one upon another, and under a pretence of trying them, she returned one again, and said they would not do, and went away; I went out after her, and brought her into a little room behind the shop. I sent for a constable; she threw her cloak off, and said I might search her; I thought they might be in the cloak; I took it up, and the buckles dropped out; at first she said a woman gave them to her; afterwards she said it was the first thing she ever did of the kind, and begged they would forgive her.
The constable deposed that he was sent for by the prosecutor, who gave him charge of the prisoner.
The buckles were produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

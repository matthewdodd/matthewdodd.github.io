            . I am servant to Mr. Millar. On Saturday the 8th of October, I was washing down stairs, and was going up between six and seven o'clock to speak to the young lady. I saw some person in the counting-house, which I thought was the young lad who lived there - but it was the prisoner who came out with the cloak. I caught hold of him, and called to two men who were going by to assist me - the young lady came out, and took the cloak from him.

(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down the street, and had my hat thrown into the warehouse. I went in after it, and the young woman asked what I wanted - I said to get my hat; she said, stop until I get a light, which she did - and if I had been disposed I could have stolen other things, as there was a large bundle by my side; she then said I was going to steal something - she gave an alarm, and the postman took me.

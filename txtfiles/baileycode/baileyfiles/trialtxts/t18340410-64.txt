, for my master - this great coat was on the coach box - I got down to attend to my horses, and saw the coat go off the box - I ran round the carriage, and saw the prisoner with it under his arm - I pursued him all down James-street - when he got to the bottom, he turned and saw me close to him - he dropped the coat - I jumped over the coat, and caught him by the flap of his coat - he threw his arms round, got me down, and struck me on the arm; but I kept him till the officer came up.

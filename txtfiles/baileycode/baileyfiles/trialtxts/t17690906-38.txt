Josephus Smith. I keep a linen-draper's shop
 in Fleet-street


. On Tuesday, the 29th of August, the prisoner came into my shop, under pretence of buying some muslin for neckcloths; before I had an opportunity of shewing her some, she put her cloak on the counter upon a piece of cloth, and got it into her possession. I did not attempt to detect her till she got to the door. I privately told my man what she had got. When she went out, he followed her. She was not got above thirty-yards before he brought her back. As soon as she got to the shop door, I threw back her cloak, and took the piece of lawn from under her arm; then I charged her with stealing it. She asked me what I meant by charging her; but she soon acknowledged she had taken it, and begged I would take no notice of it. (The price produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I came from Fulham, and wanted to go back in the stage. I made a bargain for a neckcloth, and I told him I had lost my money in a public-house, and instead of the neckcloth, I took that. He said he had had a great many losses, and he would lay all his revenge upon me.
She called 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Freeman

ANN ROSE
. I am the wife of Samuel Rose, we five in Chalton-street; Somers-town—the prisoner is my daughter. I missed amongest other things, a blanket, in Jan.—this is it—I never gave the prisoner authority to take it from my house—she was living with me at the time.

COURT. Q. How came you to prosecute this child for this little article? A. It is not only this, she has been very trying for two years—I have taken things out before, and she has pawned them again.





WILLIAM TRANAH
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I produce this blanket—it was pawned by a female, but I do not know who—I have the counterpart of the duplicate that was given.





SAMUEL FRANCIS
 (police-constable S 146.) I produce the duplicate of the

blanket. The prisoner was in bed when I was called in—I went out of the room while she dressed herself, and her mother called oat that she was destroying some duplicates—I went in and asked the prisoner for them—she refused to give them—I then held her in the bed while her mother took a bag of duplicates from under her, and this was one of them.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years—Penitentiary.

(The prisoner's sister stated that she was constantly robbing her parents, and using great violence to her mother. There were two other charges against her.)

HENRY BAPTISTE GLANVILLE
. I am in the service of Charles Carter, a linen-draper, in Cross-street, Hoxton. About the 21st of July, I missed some cotton when the policeman came on the Friday following—I do not know when it was taken—it was taken from the door—the officer showed me a piece of printed cotton—(produced)—this is it—it is my master's.





JOHN ROADNIGHT
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge on the 21st of July, for stealing a shawl—she had a bundle, in which I found this print.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Petticoat-lane to purchase linen rags—I could not get any but a piece of print, fifteen yards, and gave 4d. a yard for it—I was returning home and met a young woman, who asked me to go with her to buy a bonnet for her little girl—we had something to drink—we went into the prosecutor's shop—she said the bonnet was too little—she went out and said, "Let us stand up for the rain"—while we were there the policeman came up—the young woman gave me the bundle and ran away.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

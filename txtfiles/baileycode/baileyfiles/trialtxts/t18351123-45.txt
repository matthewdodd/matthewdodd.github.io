THOMAS CLARKY
. On the 14th of November, I was in Sun-street, Bishopagate-street—I felt my pocket picket—I turned and saw the prisoner in the act of passing my handkerchief to another—I said, "You have got the handkerchief, I will have you"—he started off the pavement, and threw the handkerchief behind him—I took it, and pursued, and I never lost sight of him until I took him.

Prisoner. I went to a friend's house, and he was not at home—I turned out again, and came into Sun-street, and then the gentleman pursued and took me—he had lost sight of me for five minutes, or more.
The prisoner then put in a written defence, stating that he had found the handkerchief, and given it to the prosecutor when he discovered it to be his.)

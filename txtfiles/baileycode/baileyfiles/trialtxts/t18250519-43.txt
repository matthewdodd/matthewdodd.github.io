EDWARD GREEN. I keep the Thatched House, public-house
.

On the 15th of April I went with a friend to Copenhagen House


, where we played at quoits; I laid my coat down, and while we were playing I heard it was gone; I had seen the prisoner there, but he was gone when the coat was missed.

            . I saw Green playing at quoits; he took his coat off, and laid it on the grass; the prisoner was standing there at the time: I afterwards saw the prisoner pull the coat off his back, and throw it down; it was given to the officer.

            . I saw the prisoner running and pursued by some men, but did not see the coat taken off; there was a cry of Stop thief! and he concealed himself in a privy.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Battle-bridge, and got a situation; I had had rather too much to drink, and when I crossed Copenhagen-fields I saw some men at play; I stood some time, and had some ale from a person who was there; Mr. Green threw his coat down, and said "Take care of my coat;" I took it up, and put it on; two young men said, "D - n your eyes, go and hide it - he is a publican, and make him stand some allowance before he gets it again."

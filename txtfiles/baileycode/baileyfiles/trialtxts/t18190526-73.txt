            . I live near Newport, upon my property. On the 5th of May I was in town, met the prisoner, and went to Wilkinson's-court, Westminster


, with her. I put my pocket-book and watch under the pillow. I awoke about four o'clock, and missed my property. The prisoner was also gone, and had locked me in the room. The pocket-book contained nine 1 l. bank notes. I saw the prisoner in custody at Queen-square on the 15th of May.
Prisoner. Q. Was you sober - A. Yes. I was very tired, as I had been three days and nights on my journey from Cardigan.

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of May I apprehended the prisoner in Cockspur-street, and told her I supposed she was aware what I took her for; she said she supposed it was for robbing the gentleman. I asked her what she had done with the watch? she said she had sold it for 15 s. to two young men, who stood by as she came out of the house where she had robbed the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence. I went with the gentleman; he was so tipsey he could scarcely stand. He was in company with several other girls.

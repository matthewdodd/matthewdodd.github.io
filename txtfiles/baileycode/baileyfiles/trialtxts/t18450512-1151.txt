GUILTY
. Aged 17.—



Confined One Year.






GEORGE COOK
. I live at Highgate. I left a jacket and a spade in an open shed on my master's premises, at Holloway, on the 30th of April—I missed them when I came to work the next morning—these are them.





CHARLES RENHALL
 (police-constable N 172.) I saw the prisoners at a little before nine o'clock at night, on the 30th of April, in the Lower-road, Islington—Sookin had this spade—I asked where he got it—he said he had been at work for a gentleman—I took them to the station, and found Sookin had got this jacket on—Sookin then said that Kenney could tell where he got the spade—Sookin then said a man in George-yard had sent him for the spade; but I took him there, and the man said he had not, and he did not know him—I discharged the prisoners, as I could not find the owner—I afterwards apprehended them again.





THOMAS SHARWOOD
. I produce the jacket, which was pawned with me, by Shepherd.





BENJAMIN SHEPHERD
. I saw the prisoners together—Sookin asked me to pawn the jacket, which I did—I came back, and gave Kenny the money.

Kenney's Defence. I met Sookin with the spade; the officer came and took us, and said he would try to get me transported.





CHARLES RENHALL

re-examined. I never said such a word—he asked me how Madden, who was tried last Sessions, got on—I said he had seven years—Kenney said, "You will never catch me, for I never carry anything."





JOHN BROWN
 (police-constable N 180.) I produce a certificate of Kenney's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted 11th Dec., 1843, and confined four months.)

KENNEY—


GUILTY
.— Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a carpet manufacturer
, and live in St. Mildred's-court. On the 31st of January, about five minutes past eight o'clock at night, I was in 'Change-alley; I felt something at my pocket, turned round, saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, and saw him pass it to his companion; I secured him, the other ran off - he denied having taken it.

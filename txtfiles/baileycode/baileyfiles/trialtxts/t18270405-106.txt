ELIZA BENSON. I am the wife of William Benson - we live in Grosvenor-street - I am a laundress. I sent my daughter Eliza with a bundle, containing three handkerchiefs and a towel, to the club-house, to my husband, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 6th of March.

            . I live opposite to Benson. I saw the prisoner in company with two other boys - I could not see the bundle snatched, but I saw the little girl crying; I opened my door, and ran out with my son; we caught the prisoner's two companions in Berkeley-square - they had not the bundle, but my belief is that the prisoner was one of the three boys.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner's mother bring him up at the office? A. I believe she did.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the office by Mr. Appleton and his mother gave me this property - the prisoner said another person gave it to him - I took that person, but he was discharged.
 - JUGGINS. I am the prisoner's mother. I gave this property to the officer, which I found in my son's room - I am afraid he brought it there.
GUILTY. Aged 15.

. On the 9th of June, between twelve and one o'clock. I saw the prisoner take a deal from apile which had not been sawed an hour before; my men were gone to dinner - he was quite a stranger. I was standing in the street, and saw him come and take up the deal, and mark it TB - he carried it about twelve yards from my premises. I went to him, and he said some man had told him he might have it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work, and a person came and told me to carry this up to the Yorkshire Stingo, and he would give me 6d.

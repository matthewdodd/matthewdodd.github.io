            .
WILLIAM GRABHAM. On the 19th of November, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was opposite the Treasury, and stopped to look at a sailor. I felt a jerk at my pocket, turned round, and missed my handkerchief-the prisoner had been just by me. I followed, overtook him in the Treasury passage, and charged him with it. Limbrick came up, and found the handkerchief in the flap of his breeches.
THOMAS LIMBRICK. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and found the handkerchief in the flap of his breeches.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief is mine.

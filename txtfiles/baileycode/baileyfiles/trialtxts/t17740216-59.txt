            . I am postilion
 to his royal highness the duke of Gloucester: I went out about the 20th of January; I met the prisoner; we had some talk, and I took her to the stable, and we consented to go to bed together: I lie in a room there that opens into the hay-loft ; I laid my watch in the window, and hung my neckcloth on one of the pegs; I waked in the morning and the prisoner was gone; I got up and found the hay-loft window left wide open; I missed my watch and my neckcloth.

            . I am servant to Mr. Murphy, the pawnbroker. On the 24th of January I took in a neckcloth of the prisoner; she went out and came back again with a watch; I went to a watchmaker according to the direction of a paper in the inside, and he told me it was the prosecutor's; I went to the prosecutor; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I went home with the man, and when a-bed I asked a present of him; he said he had no money; then I said I would get up again; he swore I should not, and took the neckcloth and lapped the watch in it, and bid me get what I could upon it ; in the morning I took them, and asked two guineas on them.

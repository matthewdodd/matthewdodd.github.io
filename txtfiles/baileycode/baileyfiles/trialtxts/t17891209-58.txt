I lost the things in the indictment; I lodge in my wife's father's house, in Christopher's-alley, Bunhill-row


; my wife's father and mother was out; we were down stairs; I was reading, and heard somebody above; my wife took the candle, and going up stairs, the prisoner was coming down stairs with the things on his shoulders; there was a boy came came first, which I collared; but he got away; the prisoner threw down the bundle into the yard, and jumped over it; she caught hold of the skirt of his coat, but could not hold him; I collared him, and called for assistance.

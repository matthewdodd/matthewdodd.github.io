            . I work at a nursery
 at Kensington. On Saturday night, the 29th of May, I went out to see a friend, and met the prisoner in York-street, Westminster


; she put her arms round me, and said, "Will you take me with you?" I said No - she put her arm round me, and in an instant I felt her hand in my pocket, where I had three half-crowns, two shillings, and 3d., and took it out; I had been drinking, but had my senses - I accused her of taking my money: she denied it - I gave her in charge directly, as a Policeman came by; he asked her what money she had about her, and I am sure she said she had none - he found my money on her.

            . I am a Policeman. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him - she said, so help her God, she had not a farthing about her, and I might search her; she pulled her pocket inside out - I then observed her hands clenched; I opened her left hand, and found three half-crowns, and in her right hand 2s. 3 1/2 d.

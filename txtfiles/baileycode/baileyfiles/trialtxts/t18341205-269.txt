CLEMENT BEARD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of December, 491bs. of brass, value 49s.; and 127lbs. of iron, value 5s.; the goods of the 

West India Dock Company, upon a certain quay adjacent to a navigable river.






JOHN FOY
. I superintend the police at the West India Dock. On the 10th of December, a quantity of machines were deposited on the south quay, export dock, to be shipped for India—I examined them on the following morning, and the brass that had been attached to two of the parts had been detached, and carried some distance towards the wall, in a more secret place—it was the property of the West India Dock Company—the prisoner works occasionally for the riggers—it is a quay adjacent to the river Thames.





ANDREW TODD
. I am foreman of the ship workers. On the 10th of December I left the Docks—the machines were all secure, and the nuts were screwed on.





CHARLES KNIGHT
. I am a day watchman. I was on duty at half-past six o'clock—I heard a knocking, and went to the place where these machines were—I saw the prisoner employed in forcing the brass off—he turned and law me, and walked off—I went and met him—he dropped something from his hand—he had removed this brass and iron from the machines—he said he belonged to a ship, which I knew he did not.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been sitting on the timber with a lad—he told me to wait while he went on board a ship—I then went towards these machines, and as I came back I met the witness—he asked where I had

been—I told him—he took me round the place, and saw these things—he then had me searched, and gave me in charge.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

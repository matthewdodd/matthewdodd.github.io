            , and I, are partners
; we keep a Manchester warehouse
 in King street, Cheapside


. On Friday night was se'nnight we sold eight pieces of Manchester velvet; they were not delivered, and one from the parcel was missed the next morning from off the counter; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and got bills dispersed about; the piece was brought home that very evening; I did not see it till the Monday, before my Lord Mayor; there were two yards and a half cut off it, which was made up into a waistcoat; (produced and deposed to.)

            . I live in Petticoat-lane; I sell oil and lemons about; 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Turner 
               



             came to my house with a gentlewoman last Friday a week, about seven o'clock, and asked if I knew any body that would buy a piece of velvet came into my head to carry it to Mr. Alesounder, a pawnbroker; I carried the piece, and told him there was an acquaintance at my house, that has got this velvet to dispose of, and I asked him 8 s. a yard; I said it was a very honest man; he offered 6 s. a yard; I said I'll take it to him again, and if he is agreeable. I'll bring it again; I went and told the prisoner I was offered 6 s. 6 d. a yard for it; he said he gave that for it himself, but he wanted money; he agreed to take it; I went back again, and brought him the money.


                  James 
                  Alesounder 
               



            . I live in Petticoat-lane; I believe this is the same velvet which I bought of Mrs. Moses, last Friday was se'nnight, for 6 s. a yard, and I sent it out by 
               
                  Jane 
                  Boulton 
               



            , who sold it to Mr. Blaney, a puolican. for 6 s. 6 d. a yard; I bought it for damaged goods by the colour. The next day I received a bill from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , giving an account it was stolen; then I sent the woman that sold it, with the money back, and to bring the velvet again. I went and got an officer, and took up Mrs. Moses, and sent a letter to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , to let him know I had bought it, and where it was, for the publican would not let the woman have it back again; he kept it, in order to have the two guineas reward; he went and made information to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and brought two men to my house to take charge of me; I sent for a neighbour; he passed his word as far as a thousand pounds, for my appearing the next morning.


                  Jane 
                  Boulton 
               



            . Mr. Alesounder sent for me to sell this velvet for him; he employs me, when any goods are out of date, to sell them; I knowing Mr. Blaney was a taylor, carried it to him; he bid me 6 s. 6 d. a yard for it; I sold it him for 7 s. and brought the money to Mr. Alesounder, and at night he sent for me, and told me the velvet was stole, and sent me back with the money; but Mr. Blaney said he had disposed of it.
Mr. Blaney deposed to that of buying the velvet of the last evidence, as she had given account; and when he found it was stolen, he carried it to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding

                  Slack 
               



            . I am a partner with Mr. Richardson; there was a piece of velvet taken off our counter; we missed it about seven or eight o'clock the next morning; I know nothing of the prisoner, nor how he came to take it.

            . I made a velvet waistcoat for the prisoner of this sort of velvet, last Monday was se'nnight.

                  Harris 
               



            . The prisoner came to me on Saltpetre-bank, last Friday was a week, with this velvet, and asked me the name of it; I said it was Manchester velvet; he asked the price of it; I said I should not trouble my self about it, I should not buy it, because I knew the man.
Prisoner's defence.
I bought that velvet of a man that had several other things to sell.

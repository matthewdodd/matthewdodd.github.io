I am a carpenter, and foreman to the prosecutor, at No. 26, Great Sutton-street. I delivered the large piece of ivory to the prisoner in Pelican court, to carry to Mr. Culliford's, No. 16, in Fountain-court


. He had seven or eight pieces. I know the ivory of smaller size.

I am a comb-maker in Houndsditch. I know the large piece of ivory. I bought it of 
               
                  George
                   Dean
               



            . There were six otherpieces, I believe. I bought it on the 29th of November.

I live in Crown-street, Moorfields. I received the pieces of ivory I sold to Mr. Dean, from the prisoner at the bar. I am sure the large piece is one of them.

            . Our shop is in Fountain-court, Cheapside.
(Deposes to the large piece of ivory)
I never sold it to any body: the small pieces which are here will match with it. I bought the ivory of Mr. Fonteloy, in Potter's fields.
- FONTELOY sworn.
I am a dealer in hard wood and ivory. I sold some ivory to Mr. Culliford.
(Looks at the ivory.)
This is part of what I sold him. I am positive of it. It is very remarkable.

             sworn.
I am partner with Mr. Culliford. The prisoner was our porter
. He never brought the large piece of ivory to our shop in Fountain-court. I am sure it is our property. The value of the ivory is about 3 s. 6 d. per pound. We did not make any enquiry about it.
To Mr. Fontenoy. What is the large piece worth? - About 40 s.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I am innocent of it.



               GUILTY

Tried by the London Jury before Mr. Justice ASHURST.

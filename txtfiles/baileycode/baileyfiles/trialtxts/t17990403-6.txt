, I keep a hatter's-shop
; I lost half-a-dozen hats, four men's, and two children's, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening.
Q. Were your candles lighted? - A. Yes; Mr. Corrock gave me information, and I pursued the prisoner, and took him, with the hats upon him, within a hundred yards of my shop; I had seen them on the counter just before, (produces the hats); they are my property.
Q. Was he running when you took him? - A. No; it was a very narrow path, where he could not well run; there were two men with him.(Mr. Corrock was called, but did not appear).
Prisoner's defence. I did not take the hats out of the shop; I was coming by the shop, and two men came up to me with the hats; they asked me if I would carry the hats for them, and they said they would give me something, but did not tell me where to carry them; they walked behind me till this gentleman came up and said they were stolen.

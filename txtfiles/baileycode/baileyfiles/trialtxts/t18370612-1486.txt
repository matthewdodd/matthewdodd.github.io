ROBBRT BLAKE
. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. I saw my cloak, two coats, and pocket-book safe about twelve o'clock on the 24th of April—my own coat I pulled off in the back parlour and left there, with the pocket-book in it—the cloak I believe was in the front parlour—between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the officer came, and I missed them—these are them—the cloak is my wife's, and one coat is my son's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever say you thought the person who took the things must hare been well acquainted with the premises? A. I do not recollect—I might have said such a thing—my opinion now is, that he had some knowledge of the premises—I know nothing of the prisoner.





STEPHEN THORNTON
 (police-constable E 53.) I was passing down Crown-street, Soho, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, between three and four o'clock, and saw the prisoner running before me with a bundle—I ran after him through several streets to No. 28, Qneen-street, Seven-dials, and as I was at the foot of the stain, I heard a door shut above—I went up and knocked, but they would not let me in—I said I would break the door—they then let me in, and I found the prisoner and two girls in bed with their clothes on, and another girl in the room wattong—1 found this bundle under the ebed on the sacking—they had denied that it was there.


Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say the bundle was given him to carry by a man? A. Yes, after I took him.
(John Barnes, hair-dresser, Turnmill-street, Ckerkenwell, gave the pri-soner a good character.)

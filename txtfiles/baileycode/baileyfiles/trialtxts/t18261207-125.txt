            . I am a Thames-police officer. I met the prisoner in Cowcross-street, on the 24th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, with this 1/2 cwt. on his shoulder, about two hundred yards from the prosecutors' - I asked how he came by it; he said that he brought it from home, and had picked it up in Fleet-market, by a butcher's door. I gave him to Carter; we were going there; but he said it was of no use, as he took it from the Salisbury Arms public-house.

            . I was with Fogg, who gave the prisoner to me - we were going to the market - he said it was of no use going further, as he had taken it from the Salisbury Arms, and distress had caused him to do it.

 ; I took her in out of Charity. She said she had no Lodgings, and I let her lie with my Apprentice girl. I had known her formerly, and she had done one Thing or another for me all the Week long. On Saturday she wash'd for me. On that Day she went away, and on Monday she was taken in Shorts-Gardens . I took her at a

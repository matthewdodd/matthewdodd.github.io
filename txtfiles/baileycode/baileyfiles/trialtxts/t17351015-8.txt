            . Some Time in June last the Prisoners and I, and Will. Beesly, and another, went into Chelsea Fields


, and there, between Ten and Eleven at Night, Sutton and Beesly knocked down a Gentleman, and took his Money, I cannot tell how much, but Sutton afterwards gave me Two Shillings for my Share of it - I lay in the Ditch ready to assist them.
Q. Where was Goodman?
Winn. He lay in the Ditch too; but I don't know that he was acquainted with their Design (for I never saw him before that Night) nor that he had any Part of the Money.
Sutton. What Places do you say we were at before and after the Robbery?
Winn. I came directly from my Mistress (Mrs. How's) House in St. Martin's Church-yard, and after the Robbery I went home again - We afterwards agreed to rob my Mistress's House.

            . My Son George never was from home after 10 at Night all the Months of June and July, but having an unhappy Character, he has often been taken up - I have too much Cause to remember the Time I speak of, for his poor unfortunate Brother was executed on the 4th of June.

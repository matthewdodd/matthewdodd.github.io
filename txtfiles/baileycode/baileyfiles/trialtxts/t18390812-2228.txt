MARY LAMBERT
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of March, 1 pair of spectacles, value 1l., the goods of 



Elizabeth Ann Travers.






ELIZABETH ANN TRAVERS
. I am single, and live in St. John-street-road. In March, I employed the prisoner as a char-woman, and for several months before—the property mentioned is mine—I went to her lodging and saw it, and at the station-house—I knew it to be mine.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you missed these articles at all? A. Yes;

some of them—this ring I lost last December—she was working at my house at the time—they are not of great value, but there is a very large quantity of them.





WILLIAM PENNY
. I found this property at the prisoner's lodging—she was in the New Prison at the time.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

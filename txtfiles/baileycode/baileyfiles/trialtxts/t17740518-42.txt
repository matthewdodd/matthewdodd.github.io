            ; we keep a house
 in Feathers court, Drury-lane


. On the 12th of May, a little before eight in the morning, the prisoner came into our house; about twenty minutes after eight I went into the yard; when I returned she was gone, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; they were taken out of a little room backwards. I found them again at Mr. Dixon's, a pawnbroker's, about twelve o'clock that day.

            . I am a pawnbroker in Wych-street; the prisoner pawned a handkerchief, apron, and a pair of sleeves with me the 12th of April, about eleven o'clock.
The prisoner, in her defence, denied the charge, but called no witnesses.

SARAH CARMAN. I am the wife of Thomas Carman, a Police-constable
. On the 19th of March, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner - he was a stranger; when I came down stairs he was standing in our passage - I had hung a gown out in the yard about half-past nine o'clock that morning, and it was then gone.
ELIZABETH BALEY. I am a dress-maker, and live opposite the prosecutor's, which is the Police-station. On the 19th of March I was sitting at work, and my mother was cleaning the window - she said, "There is a boy there, a very suspicious character; he went into the station-house empty handed, and came out with something in his apron" - we looked, and saw the prisoner with a gown hanging out behind him; I ran down, and sent a young man after him - he was brought back; Mrs. Ackroid came into her passage, and we took it from him; I kept him till the Police-officer came down and took him.
ANN ACKROID. On the 19th of March Baley told me what she had seen - the prisoner was brought back, and we took the gown from him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing, and saw a man chuck the gown on the stairs; he said, "Pick it up;" I took it up, and put it into my apron.

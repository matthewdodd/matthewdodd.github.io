            . I keep the King's Arms public-house, Holborn-hill, in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn




. The prisoner was my pot boy
; he lived with me on the 3d of February, and on Sunday the 3d of February I went to bed the last in the house. I looked in the till; I did not count the money; the next morning I came down about nine o'clock; I examined the till then. I considered to the best of my opinion there was about a pound less in it. I sent for an officer, and the prisoner was taken in custody.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody on the 4th of February; he told me he had taken some money out of the till that morning, he believed about eighteen shillings, and hehad hid it in the cellar. I took him into his master's house, and in the coal cellar he took up a coal, and there I found these thirteen three-shilling bank tokens and eight shillings.

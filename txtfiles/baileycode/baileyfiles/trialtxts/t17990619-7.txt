             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where do you live? - A. At No. 27, Worship-street, Finsbury-square


: I was last up on the 29th of May, we went to bed about eleven o'clock.
Q. Did you secure the house? - A. Yes, every thing myself, the doors and windows; I got up just before seven o'clock, and when I got up, I found the drawers all taken out of their places.
Q. Had any body been up in the house before? - A. None but the servant, and she only about two minutes before, she came running up to me; I keep a butcher's-shop; I found the drawers all taken out of their places, they were taken out on the floor, and thrown about, and a little drawer, where I kept my plate and my liquor, it was all gone; I looked, and saw a kind of iron crow mark in the window, the window-shutter fastens in with a screw, and they had forced that out, and the door was left on the jar.
Q. Do you know the property contained in the indictment? - A. Part of it, my wife knows the rest.

             sworn. - Q. You produce some things, where did you get them? - A. On Thursday, the 30th of May, I found this bag in the possession of Mrs. Turner; I took Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Lack to the prisoner's house, and Cooke said, the waistcoats were his; and 
               
                  Ann
                   Hayne
               



             said, the other things were her's.
Q. How far is Cooke's house from the house you went first to? - A. Next door, there is a palingabout this high that parts the yards; after the goods were owned by the prosecutor, Cooke owned these stockings as being his, and the neckcloth, which were all in one bag.
Q. Those stockings; you have last produced, were they claimed by the prosecutor, or Mrs. Vickers? - A. No, they knew nothing of them.
Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Before he was asked as to whose property they were, what had been said to him? - A. Nothing in the world, but bringing the people, where I had found the goods, into his presence; the man behaved extremely civil at the time.
Q. They live very near your office? - A. No.
Q. Where were their lodgings? - A. In French-alley, Goswell-street.
Q. Don't you know they cohabited together as man and wife? - A. I have been told so; Mrs. Turner afterwards addressed her by the name of Mrs. Cooke; I found a phosphorus bottle in the fob of Cooke's breeches.
Mr. Knapp. Q. That is a very convenient thing on some occasions? - A. It is a thing by which you can get a light without making a noise.

             sworn. - Q. I have got pick-lock keys, and a dark-lanthorn; I found them up a hole by the left-hand side of the chimney in Cooke's apartment; here are a vast number of them, and one dark-santhorn with a candle in it.
Mr. Gurney. Q. They might have been there for seven years perhaps? - A. No, some of them are very bright.
Q. They might have been there seven months? - A. I don't think they had been kept there seven hours.
Q. Would you swear whether they had been there seven hours or seventeen? - A. They had not been there long; the dust must have got upon the matches if they had been there long.
Mrs. TURNER sworn. - I live next door to Cooke's house; I know nothing about it.
Mr. Gurney. Q. You know that that woman has cohabited with him as his wife - she has passed as his wife? - A. Yes, always as Mrs. Cooke.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.
Q. What do you know of this? - A. I know no further than that I went through down to Mrs. Turner's apartment, and went through into the yard, on a Thursday, and as I came back again, Mrs. Hayne looked over the pales, and called "Sally," and asked me if I would be so kind as take the bag, and said they were dirty clothes.
Court. Q. She went by the name of Hayne? - A. No, she went by the name of Cooke.
Q. Was she ever called Hayne? - A. Yes, but not many times; I have not heard it only since this affair has happened; before that she was called Mrs. Cooke.
Q. You never heard her called Hayne before that? - A. No, always Mrs. Cooke.
Q. Did she throw the bundle over? - A. Yes; and told me, as she gave it me, that her husband and she were having words, and she was afraid he would cut them up; I heard them at high words; I took them and put them into Mrs. Turner's room.
Q. Was that the same bundle that the officers came, afterwards, and took from you? - A. Yes.
Q. You had not opened it? - A. No.
Q. It was in the same state you received it from Mrs. Hayne? - A. Yes.
Q. How long were the officers afterwards? - A. It was not two minutes afterwards.
Mr. Gurney. Q. Did they live together as man and wife? - A. Yes.

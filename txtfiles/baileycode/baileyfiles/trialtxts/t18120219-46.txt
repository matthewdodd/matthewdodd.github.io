Q. Where did you lose your oil cloth - A. From the door. I lost it on Thursday last, I was down stairs in the kitchen, my wife came to the area, and told me a man had stolen a roll of oil cloth, and he had taken up Piccadilly; I immediately pursued the prisoner; I looked up Titchbourne-street, I saw him crossing from the right to the left, with the roll of oil-cloth on his shoulder; I immediately ran up the street, I saw the prisoner turn into Gibson's court, as soon as he heard my footsteps behind him, he threw the oil-cloth off his shoulder, and ran into Castle-street; I followed him, and just as I had got up to him an officer was coming up the court, and at the same time he run into the Constable's Arms. This is the oil cloth, it is my property, I am positive of it.

Prisoner's Defence. In Titchbourne-street a man said if I would carry the oil-cloth to the White Bear in Piccadilly, he would give me a shilling.

                  Daniel 
                  Waldron 
               



            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Basinghall-street



. Shadwell is my apprentice
, and has been about four years and four months: I have missed quantities of leather, but was not certain who took it: I took him up upon the information of 
               
                  Peter
                   M'Cloud
               



            , who lodged at the house of the Ross's: he has been absent ever since yesterday morning.
Q. Is he bound over?
Waldron. He is. Upon his information, I charged the constable with the prisoner, for stealing quantities of soles and top leather: we had a search-warrant to search the house of Ross; they live together: they both pleaded ignorance, and said they had no leather but what was their own, which they bought at the Black Prince, in Old Bedlam. We found a parcel of leather secreted in a garret, up three pair of stairs, and locked up in a cupboard; they work below: they are what we call chamber-masters and coblers: they make and mend shoes. (A parcel of leather produced.)
Q. When did you find the leather?
Waldron. We found it a fortnight ago to-day. When I first took them up, they said they knew nothing of me, nor my apprentice neither. I verily believe the whole of this leather to be mine; here is a pair of top-pieces with my own handwriting upon them. When the old man was taxed with it before the alderman, he said, he knew some of it was mine, but not all.
Q. Did he give any account how he knew it to be yours?
Waldron. No, he did not. 
               
                  William 
                  Ross 
               



             said little or nothing: he said, my boy brought a pair of soles that have my mark upon them, to have a pair of shoes made for himself. I was before Sir 
               
                  Robert 
                  Kite 
               



            , when Shadwell was examined; I saw him sign this his confession. Mr. Holder asked him if he would sign it? he said he would freely. The two Ross's were in the hearing of his confession.
Cross Examination.
Q. How many pieces had your mark?
Waldron. There were two had.
Q. Do you deal in leather?
Waldron. No, I cut all my own leather.
Q. Did not the two Ross's deny the fact?
Waldron. The old man was going on with his confession, but he was stopped by the alderman, who said, it was a thing not desired of a prisoner.
Q. Did you promise Shadwell should have mercy, if he would confess?
Waldron. No, I did not; nor nobody else, in my presence.
Mr. Holder. I was present at Guildhall, when this confession of Shadwell's was taken by Alderman Kite; it was read over to him before he signed it; I saw Sir Robert sign his name, and the prisoner also. The two Ross's were asked some questions; the old man was going to speak, but the alderman thought he could say nothing that would clear him, he said, he did not want him to say any thing to accuse himself. The old man said, he believed some part of the leather was Mr. Waldron's; he owned he had connections with the boy; that he call'd to see him frequently, and the boy said he frequently called to see them. The alderman thought the old man's confession might proceed from ignorance, so gave him warning.
The confession read, in which he gives an account, that about a year and a half ago, he got acquainted with 
               
                  William 
                  Ross 
               



            , who desired him to bring him some top-pieces; that at several times he stole from his master, the prosecutor, several quantities, no less than fifty-three for soles; and divers top-pieces, not less than an hundred, all which he delivered to the said William and 
               
                  Andrew 
                  Ross 
               



            , they living and working together: that some were delivered when one was absent, and that they both knew that he stole the said leather; and that they constantly gave him under the value.


                  John 
                  Potter 
               



            . I went to Ross's with a search-warrant, that day fortnight, at almost seven at night; they were both at home: I said I was come to search the house for some leather, the property of the gentleman with me. Andrew told me he had no leather in the house, and knew nothing of any, but what was there below. I took up several pieces, and asked Mr. Waldron if they were his? he said, he could not swear they were: he said he was informed there were some up stairs; they both said there was none above. I asked them if there were any concealed any where? they said they knew of none. Then we went up stairs, in order to search, into the room where William lies; after seeing no appearance of leather, I asked what was in some trunks that were locked up? William said they did not belong to him, but to a lodger, who was gone to Scotland. Mr. Waldron said I must search farther, but it being at that time of night, I refused to break open the house, as the warrant expressed to search in the day-time. I said to 
               
                  Andrew 
                  Ross 
               



            , are you willing to go before any magistrate, to be examined? he said, yes: we took him to the Mansion-house, but could have no examination that night: he was enticed by Mr. Waldron to go to the Compter, in order to go to speak to his son; he gave the keeper of the Compter charge of him as a thief. After that, he went away very dissatisfied with me, as thinking I was against doing my duty; he came to me again, about twelve at night, with a search-warrant from Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Fludyer 
               



            ; I went, and told Andrew's wife we were come again to search: she said, search where you please, you are welcome. Said I, we must go up stairs: I then asked young Ross, (who was partly undressed, and going to bed) if he could not procure me the key of those trunks? he said, he could not: there was a closet by the bedside; he said, that did not belong to him. Upon that, I wrenched the door open, and found a great quantity of leather, 53 pair of soles, and 76 or 86 fore-pieces. I asked him if he knew any thing of them? he said, nothing at all. I said, you must put your things on, and must go to the Compter; he said, he did not follow the shoe-making business, but rather followed portering, and opening shops for people, and hoped we would not take him away. We put the leather into a sack, and took him to Wood-street-compter; his father was in the Poultry-compter. The next day we had an examination before Mr. Alderman Kite: 
               
                  Andrew 
                  Ross 
               



             began to make some faultering in his speech, and said, it was not all Mr. Waldron's leather, only part of it was his. William said, the leather was what the boy brought to do his own shoes. When Shadwell was giving the account, Andrew said that was false, but that was so softly, that the magistrate did not hear him.
Q. Did he deny the whole?
Potter. He acknowledged that some part of it was true.
Q. What part was that?
Potter. That was as to their first having communication with the boy.


                  Peter
               


             M'Cloud was called on his recognizance, but did not appear. His recognizance was ordered to be estreated.
Shadwell's Defence.
I am apprentice to Mr. Waldron. As I carry work to my master's men, I go by Ross's stall to the chief of them. He call'd to me, and asked me if I would take share of a pot of beer? I offered to pay for it, but he said I should not pay a farthing. They told me never to let any body have any leather but themselves, and never to let any body know of it.
Andrew's Defence.
I never bought a bit of leather of this boy in my life: I had none of him, only to make soles for him, and mend his shoes; he never gave any to me, neither did I ever give him a farthing. Mr. M'Cloud has done all this out of spite.
William's Defence.
It is a great falsity in saying he brought me leather; he only brought some once to mend his own shoes.

For Shadwell.


                  Edward 
                  Rooks 
               



            . I have known Shadwell fourteen years.
Q. How old is he?
Rooks. I take him to be about eighteen or nineteen years old; I never heard any thing against his character before this.
Shadwell. Ask my master my character.
Waldron. The boy always behaved very well, and kept good hours; he certainly was drawn in by the others.


                  William 
                  Curtis 
               



            . I married Shadwell's mother about four years ago; he was always very just and careful till this happened; his mother brought him up very well, and bestowed learning upon him.
For the Ross's.

            . I know the father by fight; but I have known the son between two and three years; he has behaved himself very soberly and honestly; that is his general character; I have trusted him with bills on my own account; he has received and brought me the money very honestly and faithfully: I am clerk to Messrs. Fuller and Cope, bankers; he was employed as a porter, to open and shut people's shops
.

            . I have known William the son upwards of two years; he is exceedingly good and honest. I have trusted him to receive and pay money for me, above a thousand pounds value.
Q. What are you?
Graham. I am clerk to Messrs. Fuller and Cope, bankers; but this was on my own account.


                  Samuel 
                  Collier

            . I am a victualler; I have known them both about eight years; they have exceeding good characters; they are tenants to me at this time; they have always paid their rent to the very day; no people can bear better characters.
Mr. Baker. I have known them, I believe, four or five years; they bear good characters in the neighbourhood; I never heard any thing amiss of them before.
Q. What are you?
Baker. I am a stationer, next door to the post-office, in Lombard-street.
Mr. Mackintosh. I am a woollen draper in Lombard-street: I have known the father twenty years, and the son from a boy; they have exceeding good characters: was any to enquire of the whole neighbourhood, I believe not one would give either a bad character.
Mr. Moss. I have known them both seven or eight years; they have exceeding good characters, as ever I heard any people in my life, setting aside this affair.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner left me on the 17th of May at night. I met a girl by the Foundling hospital with one of my gowns on: I asked her how she came by it; she told me she had it of her brother. I asked her to go home with me, which she did, and sent for her brother; who said he had it of the prisoner. The next morning he took up the prisoner. By enquiring of the pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, I found many of my things.

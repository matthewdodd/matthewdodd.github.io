            . I keep a Shop in Rosemary-Lane


, and sell Cloaths. I lost a Pair of Stays out of my Shop, the 17th of July last. The Prisoner at the Bar came into the Shop and cheapened a great many. I fitted her with a Pair, and missing this Pair, I searched her; she opened her Breast, said she, Do you think I can have them here? she opened her Gown, and I put my Hand under her Coat, and there was a Bag tied round her Waste, and the Stays were in that Bag, these are my Goods. She begged I would not prosecute her.
Prisoner. I never was in her Shop in my Life.
Compton. My Son, and my Son's Wife both, saw the Stays taken out of the Bag. 


               Guilty, 4 s. 10 d.

JOSIAH LEWIS. I am in the employ of Mr.

, Cheapside


. On the 4th of May, about a half-past eleven o'clock, a piece of cotton was stolen, which I had seen about five minutes before, near the door-way: I did not miss it until I saw it in the possession of the prisoner, in the lobby; he then got into the street, and got half way down Queen-street, which is three doors from the warehouse; I did not cry Stop thief! - the prisoner did not run, he had it in his hand, and stopped to wrap it up at a door; I do not think he knew I was following him; I took it from him.

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was delivered in charge to me at Mr. Bickham's warehouse, with the print.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along and saw the piece of print thrown on the ground; I stood and looked at it about a quarter of an hour, and then took it up to see if I could find an owner - this gentleman then came and asked me to go with him.

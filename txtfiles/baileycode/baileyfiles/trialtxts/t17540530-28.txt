            . I took the prisoner upon trial, and she went away with the things; I found her in May-Fair with the things upon her; she owned them, and am sure they are my goods
Hannah Thomas. I am wife to the last witness. We lost these goods out of our house, the prisoner was servant
 to us at that time: we took her out of Hanover-Square workhouse. I was not present at the taking of her in May-Fair, my husband took her himselfand pulled the things from off her back; I know nothing more.

Q. How old are you?
Prisoner. I do not know my right age, but believe about thirteen or fourteen.

Nash's Defence. I met the prosecutor—he was very tipsey—he had but 7d. in money—he said if I would take him home, I might pawn the watch—he said he would not go home, he had had a quarrel with his wife—I told him if he would come to my landlady she would let him have some money-when I got home she was in bed—I would not trust him in my room without money, and then he gave me the watch—I was in bed with him about an hour, and then he jumped up, and wanted me to give him the watch—I would not, and the next morning I gave it to this man to pawn.

            . I am a stationer
. On the 16th of October, in the morning, when I went out, this paper was in my warehouse, near the passage door. I know it by the Excise mark.

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Sandell. About a quarter to twelve o'clock I was in the counting-house, the prisoner came in and asked if I knew anybody who would employ him, I said I did not; he returned towards the door, and as he went out, I saw him take a ream of paper. I pursued him into Abchurch-lane, called Stop thief! and he dropped it from under his arm, and was secured up a gateway without my losing sight of him. I picked it up.

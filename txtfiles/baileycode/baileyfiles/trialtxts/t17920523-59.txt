; I lost the things on a Saturday morning at 4 o'clock; I was asleep in bed up two pair of stairs in the shop; he came to work at 4 o'clock in the morning; he had been at work five days before I missed the breeches from the top of my master's loom; the watch was in the window, the money was in my box; he, the prisoner, went away; I missed the things and I followed him; Randal Howard has them.

I let the prisoner in about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning; my wife heard him coming down stairs; the dog barked, and I thought he had done something wrong; I went up stairs and asked the boy where his watch was, and then we missed them.

The prisoner worked for me; I found the watch, half a guinea, and the breeches, on the prisoner at whitechapel; I took him into custody.

Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

WILLIAM GLADWIN
 (police-constable R 122.) I saw the prisoners in Charlton-fair on the 20th of Oct.—I saw Isaacs go behind the prosecutor as he was walking with a female—he put his hand into his pocket, took out a handkerchief, and gave it to Whintle—I secured Isaacs—I produce the handkerchief which the prosecutor gave me—Whintle ran away and dropped it—the prosecutor claimed it—it was such a coloured handker-chief as this that I saw Isaacs take.

Isaacs. You said you saw me put my hand into several gentlemen's pockets? Witness. Yes, that is true, and I saw you put your hand into the prosecutor's pocket.





GEORGE WELLS
. I am steward of an Indiaman. I was at Charlton-fair on the 20th of Oct.—I missed my handkerchief—Whintle was taken into custody by my assistance—he dropped this handkerchief when I laid hold of his collar—I picked it up—it is mine, and the one I lost from my pocket.





NATHANIEL KING
. I live in Great Russell-street. I was with the officer—I saw Isaacs put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and pass this handkerchief to Whintle—I went and held Whintle by the collar till the prosecutor came up—Whintle dropped this handkerchief at his feet.

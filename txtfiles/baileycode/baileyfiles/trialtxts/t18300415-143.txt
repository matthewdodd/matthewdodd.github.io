            . I am the wife of John Bishop, and live in John-street, Curtain-road


. On the 8th of March I was down stairs and had occasion to go out - as I returned I heard a noise in my front bed-room over head; I knew the street door was open - I went and shut it; I sat down again in my chair, and heard some person going out - I went and saw the prisoner with these clothes under his arm, which had been in a wardrobe up stairs; I took hold of him, and called a neighbour who took him from me.

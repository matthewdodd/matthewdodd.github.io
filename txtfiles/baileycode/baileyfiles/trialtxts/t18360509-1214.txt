MARGARET PROUT
 and 




MARY ANN MINGAY
 were again indicted for

 stealing, on the 
6th of April, 1 pair of stays, value 3s., the goods of 



James Butcher.







MARY BUTCHER
. I am the wife of James Butcher, of Arbor-place, Stepney. I lost these stays out of my kitchen—Mingay had been in my house two or three times—I had seen Prout but once before—I missed the stays about a quarter to five o'clock on the 6th of April—they were in my room—I knew Mingay's mother—Mingay came, I suppose, to see me—I was having my tea—she asked me for a drink of water—I gave her a milk jug to go and get some—she returned in about five minutes.





THOMAS BARNES
. I have a pair of stays, pawned by Prout—Mingay came with her the first time—I would not take them then, but Prout brought them again, and I took them.
(Property produced and sworn to).

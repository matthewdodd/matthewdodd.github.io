            . I lodge in Short's Gardens, Drury-lane


; the prisoner came to my room to enquire for some person; my wife, who knew something of her, permitted her to wash some linen in our room. I went out; the prisoner came to call me to my wife, who was taken very ill; I went home; I found my wife in bed, and the things mentioned in the indictment were lying by the side of the bed upon the ground. I spoke to my wife and then went out again; when I returned the prisoner was gone, and had stole my wife's clothes. I went in search of her; I found her, and charged a constable with her; she had the buckles and handkerchief upon her, and she told me she had sold the gown to

JOHN BLEWITT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
29th of August, 2 weights, value 1s., the goods of 



William James Whitehead.






WILLIAM JAMES WHITEHEAD
. I am a baker, and live at Woolwich. I know the prisoner, he has been in the habit of coming to my shop—I had missed weights before—the last time he came was on the 1st of September about a quarter before eleven o'clock, for a halfpenny-worth or penny-worth of bread—I quitted the shop—the weights were left in the shop—I missed them at ten minutes past eleven o'clock and saw them again on Friday, the 2nd of September, between one and two o'clock—I knew them to be mine.





SARAH BURBAGE
. I live at Woolwich. I purchased these weights of the prisoner—I had bought things of him before—to the best of my knowledge

I gave 4d. for the weights—I cannot tell when that was—I do not know when he was taken up.





WILLIAM CAMPION
. I am the officer. I received information, and took the prisoner to Sarah Burbage to see if he was the person who sold her the weights—she said he was.

JURY
to
WILLIAM JAMES WHITEHEAD. Q. Is there any mark on these weights? A. Yes—the bottom of one of them being chipped to make way for the stamp to go in—I do not know whether any one else had been in my shop.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

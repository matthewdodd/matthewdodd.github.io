            . I am a gun-maker

, and live in Fleet-street



. On the 19th of September

 the prisoners came to my shop about noon, and wished to see some guns - they selected two, after which Clark pulled out a quantity of papers, and said they were coming into large property from the death of Mrs. 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Prussia Farrington
               



            , and asked if I had heard of her?
Q. Who spoke - A. Clark, but he always said we. He selected several papers, among which was a copy of her will, and pointed out a clause in the first part of it, in which 
               
                  Rachael 
                  Trickey
               



             was left 100 l. a year during her life. He read it; this is it - (looking at it) - he also pointed out the latter part of the will, which is scored under with red ink, and which declares 
               
                  Rachael 
                  Trickey
               



             to be her heir at law and next of kin, which he said was false, that she was not anything of kin, and if she was, the 100 l. a year for her natural life was a bar to her inheriting. He said
"We have found out the heir at law." He produced another paper, containing a list of funded property, amounting to between 60,000 l. and 70,000 l.; this is it - (looking at it) - it was a notice of a distringus being lodged on the property from the Exchequer. I asked their address, Clark gave me this address -
"
               
                  Abraham 
                  Farrington
               



            , Esq., Greenfield-street, East," as the address of Dawson. He read a paper to me as being a distringus, and said they lived in the house of the deceased in Green-field-street, East. On the 20th, or next day, he gave me a paper, containing a list of the legacies, stating the dates of the will to be the 20th of May, proved on the 26th, and that the funeral was on the 29th. The legacies amounted to 3,500 l. He read an extract from a letter, purporting to be from Messrs. Blunt and Bowman, that they were satisfied of 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Farrington
               



             being the rightful heir of 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Prussia Farrington
               



            , and that they would be ready to transfer the property in a few days. He said they were solicitors to her executors. Clark said he wished me to be perfectly satisfied, and referred me to Mr. Robins, who was the solicitor in their cause. He produced several papers, and referred to a letter written by Robins to Blunt and Co., containing an account of the stock. He gave me Robins's address, No. 36, Leicester-fields, andasked me if I knew him? I said No. He said he was a respectable attorney, a man of great business, and that his country house was at Wandsworth. I sent my man to Mr. Robins, and afterwards went myself - I saw Clark there, sitting on a bench in the hall; he said Robins was engaged. After waiting about twenty minutes I was asked to walk into Mr. Booth's office, the managing clerk. I told Booth I was come to enquire relative to 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Farrington
               



             being the heir at law. He shewed me a copy of the will, and said that the 100 l. a year was an effectual bar to the claim of Mrs. Trickey, that they had discovered that she was not of kin, and it was singular, that if the executors had not been legatees they would have taken the property, if an heir could not have been found. I asked Booth if he had any doubt of 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Farrington
               



             being the right heir - he said none whatever remained in his mind - no doubt existed.
Q. Did he state why, no doubt remained - A. He said from documents and affidavits in their possession, and I think he said received that day. He said, he had been down in the country himself a week on their business, and Mr. Robins had expended a considerable sum of money on their cause already, at this time Mr. Robins came into the office, and looked over some papers, turned round, and asked Booth if I had business with him. He said,
"He is waiting to see you." I said I was referred to him by Mr. Farrington, relative to the cause I understood he had in hand for them. He appeared very indignant at being referred to, and said, he allowed no person to refer to him - he would not permit even the Bank of England to refer to him, he however said, as far as human foresight could see, the party (Farrington) were intitled to the property, and any order for payment of goods they might give on him, he would discharge, on the property coming into his hands. I returned home, and in about half an hour the prisoners came in. Clark said,
"Mr. Robins and I have been talking about your application, and he recommends Mr. Farrington to give an order on him for payment of what goods he might want," and on the 21st he gave me this order - (looking at it) - it is signed Farrington. Clark delivered it to me in the presence of Dawson - (Read) -
"To Mr. L. T. Robins. - Sir, please to stop the amount of money for Mr. Nock's bill, for guns, &c. which I have had of him, when the money comes into your hands from the will of 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Prussia Farrington
               



            , which property is now in the Bank under distringus from the Court of Exchequer."
Q. Did you give him credit entirely from what passed - A. Certainly, I delivered them on the 21st; goods stated in the bill (producing it) the amount is 111 l. 15 s. 6 d. On that day they said,
"Mr. Nock you will be paid a great deal sooner than we expected, for the executors are much alarmed at our proceedings, and wish to compromise." Farrington, then said, to me,
"I will not lose 1 d. by them." I advised him to close the business, even if he lost 500 l.; it was better than litigation. Clark joined in my advice, and said it was better to settle it soon, for the lawyer's bill would be 1,500 l. They then referred to the hasty and indecent manner in which the will had been proved. and gave me a list of the legacies. Clark said there was a good deal of money in her hands at the time she died, and at the time of her funeral, there was not enough found to bury her. They took the goods away themselves in a coach. They called afterwards and dealt largely with me. They said they bought the goods to go and have some shooting in the country somewhere in Suffolk. They had borrowed two guns on the 19th, till I could get two finished. When they came on the 21st, they said,
"We have tried your two guns yesterday, and the double one we have given to our keeper;" and said, they were determined to have a week's shooting before they turned to any more business; and at the end of the week I was to be paid. I afterwards received orders from them by post, and about the 2d of October I made further enquiry as they did not fulfill their engagements. I went again to Robins, and had still further assurances, and sent my man to discover the executors *.
* The prisoner, Clark, put several questions to the witnesses, but their answers were precisely to the same effect as on their examination in chief.


                  RICHARD 
                  COOK
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Nock. On the 19th of September, I saw the prisoners at the shop, they looked out some guns, and represented that they had considerable property left them by a person named Farrington, they always said we. Clark produced a paper from a number of others, and said it was a copy of the will of 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Prussia Farrington
               



            , and pointed out to Mr. Nock a clause, by which Mrs. Trickey is named as her next of kin, and heir at law, and another clause which left her 100 l. a year. He said, that being left her, did away her title to the residue of the property. He produced a list of the property in the funds, and asked where Goslings, and several bankers lived, and said they were going to different bankers, to enquire about the property in their hands. Mr. Nock asked for the address of some respectable person, and Clark said, that Mr. Robins, of 36, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, was their solicitor in this matter. I went to Robins, but did not see him. I saw Booth, his clerk. I found the prisoners in the office with him. Booth said, Robins was not at home. I informed him my business, in their presence, and said they had applied to Mr. Nock to purchase guns, and referred to him as their professional man. Clark corroborated my statement, by informing Booth that they had been to purchase guns. Booth immediately turned to me, and pointing to Dawson, said,
"That is Mr. Farrington;" and Dawson said Yes - my name is Farrington. Booth said, Robins did not like to have his office made a place of reference. but from the papers and documents in their possession, he had no doubt, that the property was coming to them. I asked when Robins would be in the way, he said, in about three quarters of an hour; and as I left the office Clark desired me to have every thing ready, as he wished to leave town by the coach that evening, and we need not be uneasy about the money, for there was plenty. I went home and told my master, he went to Robins, and about ten minutes after his return they both called.
Q. Whether they had goods or not then I do not enquire, but when did they call again - A. On the 21st. They talked about the property as before, and bought goods to the amount of 111 l. Mr. Nock had lent them a double and a single-barrelled gun on the 19th, till he could finish them two, and on this day Clark said, theyshould keep the double one for their game-keeper, and return the single one. On the 2d of October, I went to Robins's again, and made further enquiry about them. I saw Booth, he tried to satisfy me, but did not. They were at last apprehended.


                  CHARLES 
                  STUBBING
               



            . I am clerk to Messrs. Matthews, pawnbrokers. On the 21st of September, Clark pawned a gun between four and eight o'clock, for 12 l., in the name of 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Clark
               



            , Haydon-square; it has the name of 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Nock
               



             on it. He said, he gave 40 l. or 45 l. for it.


                  EDWARD 
                  HALE
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker, who lives in Aldgate. On the 22d of September, Clark pledged a gun with me for thirteen guineas, in a case, quite new; he said he gave somewhere about 80 l. for it, but previous to that he had pawned another for 30 s., and redeemed it when he pawned this; it is a double barrelled one, and has Mr. Nock's name on it.
MR. NOCK re-examined. The guns are mine, and those I sold them on the 21st.
Prisoner CLARK. Q. Have they ever been fired - A. Both have had the priming snapped, and the barrels may have had a little powder flashed in them just to spoil them.
Q. Did we not say we were going a pigeon shooting that morning - A. I do not remember it. I believe it was half-past five o'clock when they left.
EDMUND SIMKINS. I am employed in the Excise Office, and live at No. 24, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road. Clark took a lodging of me in July last. The other prisoner came backwards and forwards to visit him. Clark first introduced him to me by the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Fisher
               



            , and produced papers to me, purporting that he had business in hand as an agent. When he took the lodging; he referred me to Mr. Embden, No. 46, Old Bailey, and wrote a note to him, which he sealed.
Q. That is not material, he introduced Dawson by the name of Fisher - A. Yes, he said he had a deal of writing to do, and asked if I objected to his coming backwards and forwards to do it for him? I said No; I always called him Fisher, and knew him by no other name till some time in September there was a talk about recovering the estate of Miss Farrington, for a person named Farrington; I knew Miss Farrington, she had lived nearly opposite to me. The prisoner did not live there - the house was empty, and under repair, if they had lived there within the last nine or ten years, I must have known it. In September, Clark called Fisher by the name of Farrington; he told me not to be surprised if I saw Mr. Farrington walk into the house some day; he then called Fisher, Farrington; I said "Dear me, I always thought that this gentleman's name was Fisher?" Clark said,
"Oh, nonsence! it is all right, we did that to blind the children and neighbours, we don't wish the other party to know Mr. Farrington is in London." Fisher had told me he lived in East-street, Commercial-road.
Q. When this confusion of names took place, did Clark owe you any money - A. Yes, about 20 l. I had been very pressing with him; he paid me 10 s. a week for two rooms. On the 21st of September he paid me a 1 l. note, and promised me more the beginning of the week, or before if he could get it, he expected money for he had got bills to get discounted. He gave me a 10 l. note next day, and asked me to lend him 1 l., as he was going into Essex; he said I need not write him a receipt; I said then I would pay the small bills. He then shewed a duplicate, and said he had pledged two guns, one for himself, and the other for Farrington, on purpose that he should not disappoint me. I know both their hand-writings, the papers produced are some in the hand of Clark, and some in the hand of Dawson.


                  NATHANIEL 
                  BENJAMIN
               



            . I have known the prisoner, Dawson about four years - he was in my employ as warehouseman by that name. I am a packer. He lived with me four years, and left me about six months ago.
Prisoner CLARK. Q. Did you not see him at the Mansion House, and tell him if he said his name was Dawson he would get clear - A. No, I said if he could extricate himself from this business his friends wished him to leave the country.
Q. You said then Clark would he left and found guilty - A. I said I thought Clark had drawn him into it, that the punishment ought to fall upon the guilty, and he should do what he could.

            , Esq. I am executor to the late Miss C. Prussia Farrington; Messrs. Blunt and Bowman are my solicitors. I never authorized them to state that I was satisfied with the claim of Farrington to the property, or that I would transfer the property to them, or anything of the kind. Miss Farrington had no family, only a sister. The prisoners did not reside in the house. I know nothing of the prisoners. I was particularly intimate with her, but never saw them. She frequently said she had but one relation, and that was

                  Prussia Farrington
               



            's executors, and am in partnership with Mr. Blunt. We never wrote, or authorised a letter to be written to Robins, stating that we or the executors were satisfied that Abraham Farrington was the rightful heir to the estate, or that we were ready to transfer the property. I believe I had business with Robins some years ago. I never saw the prisoners.
Prisoner CLARK. Q. Did you not receive a letter from Mr. Robins, stating that he had lodged a distringus on the property in the Bank - A. We received a letter from him. We had an interview with Messrs. Smith and Lawford on the part of the Executors, and Messrs. Freshfield and Co. on behalf of the Bank, about the distringus; they said that unless a bill was field they would dismiss the distringus.

                  Catherine 
                  Prussia Farrington
               



             has been transferred in my name as trustee, and the rest in Mrs. Trickey's name.
Q. Is there any 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Farrington
               



             as heir at law, who has any claim or pretence to any part of the property - A. Certainly not. I know no such person.
Prisoner CLARK. Q. Is the statement of property on the paper produced correct - A. I believe it is.

                  FOSTER
               



            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I apprehended the prisoners at the Horse and Groom, in Portugal-street. I found a quantity of papers on Clark.


                  SAMUEL 
                  MILLER
               



            . I am an officer. I searched Clark'slodgings, and found a quantity of papers - these are them - (looking at them)
Probate of the will, and letters of administration were then put in and read, also the following extract from a letter, signed 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Farrington
               



            , addressed to - Clark, Esq. (and proved to be Clark's own writing).
"I do not see any necessity for going to Mr. Nock any more, as I gave you an order to him for three guns. Go to Nock himself, and desire him to have the goodness to send them down as soon as possible, and he shall have the money without waiting." Dated Misley.
DAWSON'S Defence. I admit living with Mr. Benjamin by the name of Dawson, but my real name was Farrington, and I think myself entitled to the property.
CLARK's Defence. Mr. Farrington came to me, saying he wanted to trace his pedigree. I went with him to the church Miss Farrington was buried at, and found his statement correct about the property being left. He said he was born in Essex, I found his register there, believed him to be the heir at law, and took the necessary steps. I took him to a solicitor and advised with him - he said he thought him entitled to it. They issued distringuses on the stock, and took legal means to obtain the property, and try his right in a court of law. At this time we went to Mr. Nock's and obtained credit, but used no false pretences, as I really thought the property belonged to him. I told Nock to go himself to Robins, and get satisfied, and not let us have anything till he was satisfied.

            . On the 22d I supplied the prisoners with goods to the amount of 47 l. 10 s., in consequence of the same pretences they used in the other case, that Farrington was heir at law, to Miss Farrington, and coming into possession of her property, and that the solicitors were ready to transfer the property.
MR. BOWMAN. I neither wrote, or authorized a letter to be written to Robins, stating that the trustees were ready to transfer the property.

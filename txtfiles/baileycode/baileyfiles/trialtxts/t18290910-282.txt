. On the 31st of July, the prisoner came to the shop; I was showing her some prints -I saw the upper pieces move, and one slipped off the counter; the prisoner had bought eight yards of one, paid 1s. on it and said she would call for it at night - I accused her with taking one off the counter - she denied it; I came round, looked into her basket and found it there - this is it; there is nineteen yards of it - it is one I had shown her, and asked her 1s. a yard for.
Prisoner. It was not in the basket. Witness. Yes, it was; I took it out myself when I accused her of it; she took her basket and put it on the other side of her, and put her apron before it - when I found it, she said she did it through distress; that her mother was lying ill in bed, and she lived at No. 25, Golden-lane, which is false - she was not known there.

HENRY GOODMAN. I was walking in Union-street


, between twelve and one o'clock, on the 27th of January, and saw two young men behind a gentleman, and suspected them - I kept my eye on one of them for about two minutes - they were walking fast together, behind the prosecutor - I then saw a handkerchief drawn from the prosecutor's pocket, by the other, and thrown to the prisoner - they were both close to the prosecutor - I could not see which hand took it - but I think it was the other- I saw the other give it to the prisoner, who pushed it into his bosom, and both ran off down a street on the other side - I asked the gentleman if he had lost anything - he said yes, his handkerchief - I ran after the prisoner, the other ran another way, and at the bottom of the street, he saw me coming, and threw it over his left shoulder - I caught hold of him, brought him back, and took it up - I brought him to the prosecutor.
EPHRAIM JACOBS. I was walking in Union-street - Goodman asked if I had lost anything - I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I crossed over the road, and saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief over his shoulder, and, immediately after that, the witness took him - this is my handkerchief.

Rebecca Hill. On the 13th of February, the prisoner came to me as a servant
. On the 20th she went away; I missed a gown out of one of the drawers: I pursued her, and charged a constable with her, and she confessed she had pawned it with one Howard, in Houndsditch.

            . I am servant to Mr. Howard, a pawnbroker. I took in this gown of the prisoner on the 21st of February, in the name of 
               
                  Alice

            , (producing it.) I have taken in many things of her in that name.
The gown was deposed to by the prosecutrix.

She said, she would make me a present of the gown, if I would stay with her, she liked me so well.
She called two women, who gave her a good character.

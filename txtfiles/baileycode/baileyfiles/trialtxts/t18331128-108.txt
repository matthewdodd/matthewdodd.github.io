            , of Great Russell-street




. The younger prisoner came into my employ about the latter end of June, or the beginning of July, as servant of all work
; she left on the 2nd or 3rd of November, and that night we missed a silver-spoon worth 25s., or 26s.; this is it; I missed a handkerchief while she was with me; I cannot swear that this is the handkerchief, as it is not marked.

            , Jun. My mistress said, that her son had robbed her, of her spoon; he was frequently there, getting tipsy with the servants. Witness. My son was never in that house where the spoon was lost from; I live at No. 106, and he lived there, but the spoon was lost from the other house No. 104, where the prisoner lived; it is let out in apartments; my son is about seventeen; I never said he took it; he had not been in that house for a fortnight or three weeks.
COURT. Q. Had there been any intimacy between your son and this girl? A. No; he never spoke to her.

            . I am servant at No. 104. This is Mr. Mc Lellan's spoon; he has five more marked the same as this; they were in my care; on the Wednesday before the prisoner left I locked up the six spoons in a drawer; she left on Saturday the 2nd of November; she said, she should leave; Mrs. Mc Lellan's son used to come there, but he had not been for a fortnight or three weeks before she left; he was offended about something; I don't know what; he used to speak tome before that, but he never said anything to her; I don't know whether he had any quarrel with her; I don't think he had; the drawer the spoons were in, was in the front kitchen; I had put down the keys, and the prisoner might have gone to them; she had been with me in that house about three weeks.
Ann Lugg, Jun. The reason I left was because she beat me, and so did the man who slept in the kitchen. Witness. I never touched her.
Ann Lugg. Sen. When I took the child back, this witness would not let her in, but I insisted that she should go in, and stay till Mrs. Mc Lellan came home, which she did; her mistress said her clothes were right in her box, and then told the witness to look if the spoons were right, and she said they were.
Witness. Yes, she told me to look for the spoons we had in use, which were right; I did not look in the locked drawer till afterwards.

            . I am a pawnbroker in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. This spoon was pawned to the best of my recollection, by the elder prisoner; I certainly think it was her, but it was on Saturday night, the 2nd of November, and we were rather busy; it was pawned for 12s., in the name of "Mason, 4, Tottenham-street" - I have a slight recollection of her face, but cannot tell her dress.
Ann Lugg, Sen. I never was in the shop till the Tuesday following, when I went to pawn a gown of my own.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Hampstead-road. I have a handkerchief pawned by the elder prisoner on the 7th of September, in the name of Mason, for 6d.
Ann Lugg, Sen. It is my own, and was pawned in my own name. Witness. No, she pawned it in the name of Mason, which was the name she generally pawned in; I had known her before.

             (police-sergeant E 16). I took the prisoners; I found the duplicates of two handkerchiefs on the elder prisoner, both in the name of Mason; I found none of the spoons.

            , Jun. Defence (written). I left my situation through the cook's beating me, and turning me out of the house; I went home to my mother, who returned with me, and insisted on my staying until my mistress came home, when it was agreed I should leave as soon as my week was expired, which I did. My mother came for me on Saturday evening, November the 2nd. The cook and my mistress were both in the kitchen. I fetched my box, and my mother emptied it before them, and they said there was nothing there belonging to them. My mistress asked the cook if the spoons were all right, she said they were. My mistress paid me, and I went home. On the following Tuesday, November the 5th, a policeman came and said Mrs. Mc Lellan wished to speak with me. I went with him immediately; when she charged me with stealing a table-spoon, which I knew nothing about. I was then taken to Hatton-garden, and remanded until Friday, the 8th instant, when I was re-examined and discharged. The next night the policeman came to my mother's lodgings and asked her to let him see her duplicates, which he had seen before, when he kept two of them. They were two pocket handkerchiefs which Mrs. Mc Lellan said I had stolen, and my mother received, which I deny. One of them I pledged in the afternoon of the day that I went to Mrs. Mc Lellan's, after ten o'clock at night, on Saturday, July the 20th; nor did I see my mother for a week afterwards. After I had been at Mrs. McLellan's some little time, my mistress sent me on several occasions both to pledge and to redeem pledges for her. The servant who turned me out of doors sometimes gets tipsey, and there is a man also sleeps in the kitchen where the spoons were kept. My mother never came to see me except when my mistress was made acquainted with it.
MRS. McLELLAN. I once sent her to pawn a pair of spoons in October; I lost a great many things while she was in the house.

            . The prisoner lodged in my house; in the lower part I lost a pair of brass candlesticks, a decanter, and a drinking glass; I know them perfectly well - I have had them these twenty years - we missed several other things when the officer came on the 11th of November - she had no one there but herself; her children were out.

            . I produce the articles; this decanter was pawned by the prisoner for 9d., in the name of Devine; the glass was pawned for 6d., but I cannot say by whom.
Prisoner's Defence. I had not left my lodging. I did it to take my little girl some things. My brother offered to get them out again for him.

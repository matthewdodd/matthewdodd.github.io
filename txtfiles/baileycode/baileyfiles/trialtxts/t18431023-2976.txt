2976. 




ANN MORRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of Oct., 1 shirt, value 2s.; and 1 handkerchief, 2s.; the goods of 



Elizabeth Flanagan, her mistress; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH FLANGAN
. I am single, and am a laundress; I live in Mount-pleasant, Upper Clapton—the prisoner worked with me. On the 14th of Oct. I put a shirt and handkerchief in a basket, and gave them to the prisoner to take to Mr. John Burgess, one of the five bouses in Lower Clapton—I inquired where they ought to have gone to, and found they had not been delivered according to the inventory, which in presence of the prisoner I placed in the basket—these are part of the things.





AUGUSTINE THOMAS FISH
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce these things, pawned by a person, not the prisoner, on the 14th of Oct., in the name of Ann Turner.





MARY ANN HUMPHERYS
. I am in the service of Mr. Burgess. The clothes were brought home on the 14th of Oct., and these things were deficient—they ought to have been brought home.





JOHN GULLIVER
 (police-sergeant N 8.) I had the prisoner at the station—she was in great pain, and wanted to go to the water-closet—I showed her there—she staid there rather long—after she came out, I went, and found the ticket of these things.





WILLIAM FRENCH
 (police-constable N 204.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 39.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . On the 6th of August, I was at the corner of Nicholas-lane, going into Cannon-street


, Mr. Wall came after me, and said he saw the boy at the bar take my handkerchief out of my pocket; he had stopt him; I felt and missed it. We took him before the sitting Alderman; he was committed, and the handkerchief was found upon him when in the Compter.
Q. What time of the day was it you lost your handkerchief?
Bond. It was about one or two in the day.
Devereux Wall. I saw Mr. Bond going along with his handkerchief hanging out of his pocket; the boy at the bar ran after him and took it out, and gave it to a man behind him; the man seeing I observed them, gave it the boy again; I stopt the boy, and ran after Mr. Bond, and asked him if he had lost his handkerchief; he felt, and said he had; when the boy was committed, I saw the handkerchief taken out of the lining of his coat when in the Compter.
Prisoner's defence.
My father lives in Bridgewater-Gardens; the handkerchief hung out of the gentleman's pocket, and it dropt down on the ground, and I picked it up.

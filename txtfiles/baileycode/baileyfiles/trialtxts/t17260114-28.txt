                   not yet taken) did break and enter the dwelling House of 
                     
                        
                           Mary 
                           Parker 
                        




                      
                  , and steal from thence 9 Pewter Dishes, value 40 s. 9 Pewter Plates, value 9 s. a Bed-pan, value 5 s. 8. Copper-pot Lids, value 6 s. and other Things, the Goods of Mary Parker, on the 8th of December last
, in the Night
            . The Witnesses gave the following Account. Mary Parker (who sells Coals and Sand
 in Kings-Street, Wapping


) went to Bed about 11 at Night, and made fast all the Doors and Windows. About 2 in the Morning, she was call'd up again by the Watch, and found that the Shop Window was broke open, some of her Goods taken away, and a pair of Shoes with Buckles in them standing at the Door, which were suppos'd to be pull'd off to prevent too great a Noise, and were left behind in haste, upon the Watchman's coming his Rounds. The Shoes and Buckles were found to belong to the Prisoner, Tom. Randal, who lived in the Neighbourhood, (
               
                  Jack 
                  Howard 
               



             had some time ago been order'd for Transportation, but making his Escape, he went for Shelter to his Aunts second Husband, 
               
                  Robert 
                  Lammas 
               



            , who lives in Love-Court by the Ditch-Side, and is one of St. Bride's Watchmen. He to secure his Kinsman, took him to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Watkins 
               



            , who lived in a Cellar against the Cannon in Cannon-Street, Wapping; and desir'd her to let him lodge there, and she agreed to it, and this was 2 or 3 Weeks before Mrs. Parker lost her Goods.
About 2 a Clock that Morning, that those Goods were lost, Jack Howard and the 2 Prisoners, with a Parcel of Pewter and Brass in a Bag, came to Moll's Lodging, and knockt her up; she presently let them in, and there they agreed to carry the Goods to Lammas. Pursuant to which (the same Morning) Jack Howard took the Goods in a Bag; and Moll Watkins and Joseph Taylor went with him, but they left Randal a Bed. When they came to Robert Lammas's House, he and his Wife went with them to a Pewterers, at the Cock and Wheat-Sheaf, between Harp-Alley and Stone-Cutter's-Street


, who gave them six Pence Half-penny a Pound for the Pewter; which prov'd to be the same that Mrs. Parker lost. Jack Howard was entrusted to take the Money for it all; but he ran away with it, and never gave any of them a Farthing.

                  Lammas 
               



             thus depos'd. I had been acquainted with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Watkins 
               



             a pretty while, and knew that when her Mother died, she left her a great deal of good Brass and Pewter; and when she came to me with these Plates, she told me that they were her own, and that she was obliged to sell them, because she was in Lection of having her other Goods seiz'd for Rent. And as for 
               
                  John 
                  Howard 
               



             he promis'd to be very good, and leave of his old Trade; and therefore my Husband desir'd 
               
                  Mary 
                  Watkins 
               



             to let him be in her Cellar, till he could get a Ship to send him to Sea out of harms Way.
The Prisoners in their Defence said that they had been a merry Making, and coming away about 2 in the Morning, they met 
               
                  Jack 
                  Howard 
               



             with a Bag, and something in it; that he asked them to go with him to his Lodgings, and they consented, it being rather too late to go to their own. The Jury 


               acquitted them of the Burglary, but found them both guilty of Felony, to the Value of 39 s.

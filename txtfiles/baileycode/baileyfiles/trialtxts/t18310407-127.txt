JOHN BATEMAN. I am a pawnbroker. I have a chisel, pawned on the 3rd of March, by the prisoner - I gave the duplicate of it.

            . I took the prisoner, and found this duplicate and fifty-eight others upon him.

            . I am a cabinet-maker
. This chisel is mine - I had had it about two months before I lost it; the prisoner worked at the next bench to me - I never allowed him to pawn my property.
Prisoner. It is entirely false, and I should like to know why he has not indicted me in his own name - he goes by the name of William Williams. Witness. Cox is my name, and I have my indentures here to prove it - I know this chisel by the handle, which I made myself.

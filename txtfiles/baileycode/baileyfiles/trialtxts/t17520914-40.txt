                  Edwards 
               



             was a servant
 with me almost two years, as a nurse and chamber maid
. My plate was ordered to be got together to be cleaned on the middle of July. I missed a silver saucepan, which had not been used during the time she had been in my service; it was not under lock and key, the key was lost. I inquired of her, after I had looked about, where it was, she said, I'll go and look for it; she went to the place where it should have been, and returned again and said it was not there. What, said I, have you moved it, and where? She said indeed, madam, I have took it to keep Benjamin out of prison, and if I would let her go out, she would go and find it. She returned and said it should be got some time the next day. I missed a silver watch and a gold chain fixed to it, which had been a constant plaything for the little girl; I asked what was become of them, she said she had taken and given them to Milley. We missed other things by looking about, a silver milk pail for a tea table, a silver egg, a play-thing of the child. She pretended she knew nothing of them. Then she went and fetched Millicent. After that we missed 4 sheets, and 6 napkins.

             produces the goods mentioned. She deposes they are her property, except the watch, the egg and the milk pail. They never were out of my house to my knowledge till she took them away. I knew the sheets were in a store chest about two months ago. I have seen the silver saucepan in the house since she lived with me. I kept her in the house endeavouring to find out the things. I got a constable and took her before the justice ; there she owned all, that she had taken the things she was charged with. Her sister Millicent was taken before the justice at the same time, and was charged with having received them from her sister, and pawning them. She cried and told us the linen was at Mr. Figg's, the saucepan at one Mrs. Hunt's in Orchard street ; I can't say she said she received them, but she did not deny it. The mother came to my house the morning after the discovery, and said she was sorry, and asked ten thousand pardons. She denied seeing any thing.

                  Barker 
               



            . I am daughter to Mrs. Griffis, I live with her. I lost a silver watch with a tortoiseshell case, a silver milk pail, two dimitty petticoats, one tweezer case, and one silver snuff-box. I did not miss these things till the beginning of July. I asked 
               
                  Ann 
                  Edwards 
               



             what was become of them; she owned she had taken them, and lent them to her sister Millicent to pawn, that Millicent came to her in her brother's name. She was sent for the next morning, I charged her with receiving them of her sister and pawning them; she acknowledged the charge, and promised to bring them again. She said some was at Mrs. Hunt's in Orchard street; at that time we could get no more out of her. I was with her before Justice Lediard, Ann confessed there she was guilty of taking the things mentioned in the search warrant which was read to her. She said she had delivered them to Millicent. Millicent owned she had received those things from her sister. The brother and mother were then taken up; she confessed where the plate and chain were; that she had told their distresses to her sister, who had lent her the things and she had pawned them. She likewise confessed that the watch and chain were at Mrs. Sugg's in the Bowling Alley. I think the two dimitty petticoats and silver pail were in Pye street. The mother denied she knew any thing of the matter; then the son denied it, but he afterwards said he knew of it, and that when he was ill, Ann cried to him to have the things taken out, upon which he raised some money and got them out. She looks at the silver watch, this I saw in March last. The silver milk pail, silver snuff-box, and tweezer I saw in Jan or Feb. They are my property.

                  Chip 
               



            . I am a constable. On the 25th of July I was applied to, to take up 
               
                  Ann 
                  Edwards 
               



            . I apprehended her. When I brought her to justice Lediard, she owned the charge laid against her, and cried, and said, had it not been for her sister's persuasion she should not have done it; and said, she feared it would come to this at last, that she never should get the things again.
Q. Done what?
Chip. Taken the things and delivered them to her sister Milley. Then I took the other three. Millicent said before the justice that her sister Ann delivered them to her, and she had pawned them. She went with me to Orchard-street to Mrs. Hunt's, there I found a silver saucepan, a tweezer, and two white petticoats. At Mr. Pearson's in Long Ditch I found the silver milk pail, and at Mr. Sugg's a Cornchandler, in Bowling alley, I found a tortoise-shell watch, and a gold chain. In Pye street, one petticoat and four aprons; at Mr. Figg's in Peter-street two pair of sheets, six napkins, four pillowbears, a silver snuff-box, and a silver egg. These goods produced are the same I found.

            . I am a cornchandler, I know all the prisoners.

                  Edwards 
               



            , the mother, brought the watch in a tortoise-shell case, and a gold chain to pawn, about ten or twelve days before they were taken up, and said she was in great distress, desiring me to lend her a guinea; I did it out of charity; she told me it was one of her daughter's. They always lived in good credit; I had no mistrust it was stolen.
Mrs. Hunt. I only know Millicent. I keep a pawnbroker's shop; she brought the silver saucepan three several times within the compass of two years; the last time was the 28th of February. She laid it in the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Edwards 
               



            , and said it was her mother's. I lent her two guineas always on it. She brought the tweezer case; that had been pawned a year last August; and two dimitty under petticoats.
Mrs. Figg. I keep a pawnbroker's shop, and know the three women. Millicent chiefly brought things to me; a silver snuff-box, a silver egg, two pair of sheets, and six napkins; Mary, the mother, brought one of the napkins. They always pawned them as hers and her mother's; Mary only desired so much money. Some was brought September was twelvemonth, some in February, some in May, and some in June. They did bear a good character.

             said nothing in her defence.
Mary's defence.
I never saw any thing but the watch.
Millicent's defence.
I never did any thing with a design to wrong them, but with an intent to bring them again; it was necessity; being out of place, that obliged me to do it.

. The prisoner was in my parlour on the 7th of October; I opened the back door to let him out at twelve o'clock at night - I saw this picture under his coat - he came in with two other men; one had a bundle, with some bread and meat in it, and the other had a pot of mine, with some beer in it.

             (Police-constable S 5.) I took the prisoner.
Prisoner. I had it in my hand; a young man there had two bundles, and this picture laid beside him - when the landlord came and asked me to go out, this man took up the bundles, and under them was this picture; he said,"Take it up" - I took it, and went to the door - the landlord asked what I had; I said, "A picture;" I thought it belonged to the man.

FRANCIS INGLESBY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of March, 4 yards of fustian, value 4s., the property of 



James Martin, his master.






JAMES MARTIN
. I am a wholesale slop-seller, and live in Houndsditch, the prisoner had been in my service three or four years to cut out work. On the 10th of March, as usual, he left work about hall-past twelve o'clock to go to dinner—I desired the foreman to follow him and desire him to return—he came back with my foreman—he could not have gone more than two or three yards—I asked him if he had any property of mine—he said no—his hat was then taken off, and two pieces of fustian found in it—I sent for an officer, and I told the prisoner I was pretty certain he had got more—he then drew two more pieces out of his trowsers, which I desired my clerk to mark.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. He had been for some time in your employ? Yes—"There was no mark on it—I was certain it was mine—but I had this marked to distinguish which he took from his trowsers—they had all been, cut from one piece—rather more than four yards were missing.




GUILTY
. Aged 50—


Transported for Seven Years.

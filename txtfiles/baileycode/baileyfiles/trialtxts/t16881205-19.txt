             were Tryed, the first as Principal, the other as Accessary, for 


               Felony and Burglary, committed on the House of 
                     
                        
                           John

                  , and taking thence Linen Silks, wearing Apparel, Plate, and Money, to a great value
            , some of which were found where Robinson had disposed of them; but 


               the Burglary not being proved, he was found Guilty of Fellony
            ; as for the other, against whom there was no material Evidence; it appearing that he had rather contributed towards the Discovery, he was 

               Acquitted
            .

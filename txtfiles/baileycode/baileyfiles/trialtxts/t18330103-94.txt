            . I am the person who was convicted and was on board the bulks; I was liberated by thispardon; I know the prisoner Smith. On the 5th of July last, I saw him and Grimbley at the Bank public-house, in King-street, Drury-lane, about ten o'clock in the morning; we went out together to pick pockets - we went to the top of Lansdown-passage, Berkeley-street, and saw Mr. Holmes, whom I did not then know, and two other gentlemen coming across; we followed them up Hay-hill



 - Smith took a pocket-book out of Mr. Holmes' coat pocket, and gave it to me; we all turned back, and went into Berkeley-square, where we opened the pocket-book, it was red morocco, and I took from one pocket one 100l. note, one 20l. note, and four 5l. notes, and a silver pencil-case - there were some papers in the book; I think I should know the pencil case again - we then went to Davies-street, Berkeley-square, where we took a coach, and drove to King-street, Drury-lane; we went to a house, in which Mrs. Page lives in the parlour - she used to do our washing; we all three went in there - I burnt the pocket-book in her presence; I had not taken any thing from it but the notes and the pencil-case; we all three then went to the Bank public-house, where we looked at the notes again - we then all three went to No. 43, Eagle-street, to

                  Guests
               



            ', the son of the prisoner Guest; there is a shop in front, and a half-door - we went into the parlour, and William Guest asked us what we had got; I told him some notes - I pulled them out of my pocket, and gave them to him, and I showed him the pencil-case, but still kept it in my hand; he turned his head and so did I, and I saw Frederick Watts standing leaning over the half-door -
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             asked him what he wanted: he said Nothing, and went away; William Guest told us to come over with him to his father's, and he would sell the notes for us - William Guest, I, and Smith, then went to Holborn, and took a cab; we had left Grimbley in the Bank public-house - we then drove over Waterloo-bridge to Belvidere-road



; we stopped at a house which has a shop in front - we knocked at the private door, and the prisoner Guest answered the door; we went in, and 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             pulled the notes out of his pocket, and gave them to his father, the prisoner, and likewise the pencil-case which we had sold to 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



            , as we were going along in the cab, to pay the cab hire which was 2s. - the prisoner Guest put on his spectacles, looked at the notes two or three times over, and asked what we wanted for them; I asked him 120l. for them - he said he could not give that, but he told us to wait a bit, and he would be in in a short time; we waited about a quarter of an hour - he then returned, and offered us 90l. for the notes, and we agreed to take it - we made this agreement in the back parlour; we then went up stairs with him to a bed-room, and he went to an old oak chest, and took out a little bag of sovereigns - we came down again into the parlour, and he gave me thirty sovereigns and three 20l. notes; I asked him if he could not let me have it all in gold, as we did not know how to get the notes changed; he said No, for he had taken all his gold to the Bank a short time before, and got notes for it; the notes he gave me were new looking notes - 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             then said he had ten sovereigns in his pocket, which we might have, and he would go with us to the Bank of England, and change the notes - he then got a pen and ink, and wrote his name and address on all three notes - we then all three came over Waterloo-bridge, took a coach in the Strand, and went to the Bank; we went up some stairs there, and got the notes signed, or done something to; we then came down stairs again, went to another part of the Bank, and got cash for them; we received sixty sovereigns - William Guest took ten sovereigns out of the sixty, and gave me the other fifty; we came back again to the coach, and drove to the foot of Holborn-hill - we parted the money in the coach; I gave Smith thirty sovereigns, took thirty myself, and I kept thirty to give to Grimbley -
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             left us in Holborn, and Smith and I went into a hosier's shop, and bought six handkerchiefs and two shirts; we then went to a tailor's shop, which had the name of Spratswell over the door - Smith there bought a pair of white trousers; I asked them if they had a coat to fit me; they had not - we then went to another tailor's, and I bought some clothes; we were then going into a jeweller's shop to buy a watch, and just as we were going in we met 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             and Grimbley - Grimbley went into the shop with us, and I gave him his thirty sovereigns in the shop; we then went a little higher up, and each of us bought a hat - I then left them, and went to 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



            's - I there cleaned myself, and changed my clothes; while I was doing that Smith, Grimbley, and 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             all came in, and we agreed to go down to Brighton, but I said I would go to my mother before I went, which I did; as I was returning I saw Smith Grimbley, and Higgins, the officer, in a cab.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How old are you? A. Nineteen - I had not been a pickpocket long; I cannot recollect when I began; it might be about eight months before this happened; I have been three times in prison - I was sent from Newgate to the hulks; the first time I was taken up was on suspicion of stealing some things - I do not know what they were; that was about two months after I began thieving - it was from a house in St. Martin's-lane; I was charged with stealing knives about a fortnight afterwards; I was discharged for stealing Mr. Holmes' note; and three days afterwards I was taken for stealing a purse, but went out by proclamation, and six weeks afterwards I was taken for stealing a handkerchief; I have not been in prison on any other occasion - I was sent on bail to Tothill-fields for being in company with a lad who stole something from his master - I do not recollect any more times - I was nearly eight weeks at the bulks before I got out; I was tried on the 20th of October, for receiving a pocket handkerchief, or for stealing it; I do not remember which - when I was at the hulks Mr. Thomas and Mr. Higgins came to me; they said they would hold out no promise, but if I had any thing to say I was to say it to them - I had intimated to Mr. Higgins that I had something to say when I saw him in Newgate, two or three days after my trial - I did not send for him; he came to me - he said very little; I do not remember what it was about; I had made a communication to my cousin, and Higgins came, with my cousin, to me - he did not speak about these notes, nor about Mr. Holmes' robbery -I cannot recollect what it was about; I have known Higgins from the time I began to be a thief - he is an officer; I have seen him, and drank with him; I do not know that he knew I was a thief - he never proved me one - he had taken me into custody; I drank with him after that, but paid for what I had - I have drank with him since I camefrom the hulks; he lives in Drury-lane, and I in Bow-street - he has had me in custody from the time I came up from the hulks; I was not charged with any offence -Higgins told me I was to have my pardon before I gave evidence - I have not had the pardon; I was kept in custody at the station, but I went to Higgins' to have my breakfast, and sometimes my dinner, and sometimes he used to bring it to me; I have been once or twice in a public-house with him - I cannot tell how often, perhaps six times: sometimes we had a pint of beer - I was not told what I was going to Bow-street for; I had no idea, but Higgins told me that Mr. Stafford craved an interview with me, and I should see when I got there - the interview was about Mr. Holmes' robbery; Mr. Stafford took down my deposition - I was sworn, but there was no prisoner present; there was a Magistrate - no questions were put to me - I told of my own head; this was last Wednesday week; I saw Mr. Higgins twice on board the hulks, with Mr. Thomas - they asked me about Mr. Guest, and several things about the robbery, but they did not say I was to be brought up; I did not know what I was brought up for- my object in appearing here to-day is to serve the public, not myself; I did not know I was going to have my pardon till last Tuesday - Higgins told me he dared to say Mr. Stafford would get me a pardon; I was not certain that it was got - no one had said any thing to me about a pardon before then, upon my oath.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say that for about eight months you have been out on these expeditions - whose company did you go in? A. Very often with Smith and Grimbley.

                  KNOX HOLMES
               



            , ESQ
. I lived in Grafton-street, Bond-street. On the day before this robbery I put 125l. in Bank notes into my pocket-book, but it contained other notes to a considerable amount, 30l. at least; there was one 100l. note, and some 5l. notes - I had full 140l. in notes, or more; I had a pencil-case in my pocket-book, which I bought of a jeweller in the Strand - the name of Smith is over the door; I had sent that pencil-case back to him to be repaired - it had a stone in the top of it, with a crest on it; when I lost my pocket-book it was in it - the pencil-case was a particular one; I should know it again: I did not miss my pocket-book for some time after it was gone - I walked that morning near Berkeley-square; I came up Hay-hill, and into Dover-street - this is my pencil-case, but the stone is removed; I took rather a fancy to this case, and had a pocket-book made to fit it - and then I found the head of the pencil-case unsoldered, as I turned it rather sharp in sealing a letter.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You know nothing of either of the prisoners? A. No, except from having seen Smith at Bow-street; the pocket-book was in my right-hand coat pocket; my handkerchief was not in that pocket - I did not feel any pull at my pocket; my pocket is deep - it was rather a large pocket-book, made to hold this pencil-case; there were some letters in it- I missed it about twelve o'clock - I had left home about ten; I had not seen the pocket-book that day -I had seen it at seven o'clock the evening before, and had put it into my pocket; I had the same coat on I have now- my servant generally brushes my clothes in the morning, but having this money in the pocket-book, I desired him not to take my coat down in the morning; I had not taken the book out of my pocket, but I felt it there.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Though you had not seen the pocket-book, had you felt your coat, so as to know that it was there? A. Yes, I had, more than once, enough to satisfy myself that it was there, after I was in the street - I have heard that pickpockets do things very dextrously, but this is the first time I was ever robbed.

            . I live in the Strand - the name of Smith is over my door. I sold this pencil-case to Mr. Holmes, and afterwards repaired it; I am quite sure it is the same - there was a stone in it, which is not in it now.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you a working silversmith, or do you only sell? A. I do both; I was apprenticed to Mr. Guest, of Fleet-street, who used to employ persons to manufacture for him; I have no manufactory in my own house.

             In July last I lived at No. 25, King-street, Drury-lane - I knew Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley - I washed for Smith and Kennedy; they all three came in together one morning in July - Smith and Grimbley asked if I had the kettle boiling, and they sat down and had some breakfast - I afterwards saw Kennedy poking up the fire, and he poked a pocket-book in, and it was burnt - Smith and Grimbley were having their breakfast, and took no notice of what he did.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did they all come in together? A. Yes, and in five minutes Kennedy went out and staid three-quarters of an hour - when he came in he produced the pocket-book; Smith and Grimbley remained there all the time.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see who had the pocketbook before it was in the fire? A. Yes, Kennedy had - he pulled it out of his pocket just as he came inside the door; Smith and Grimbley were sitting with their backs towards him - they might have seen it, but I do not think they saw it put into the fire till I spoke about it, and objected to Kennedy poking up the fire; Kennedy went out directly he burnt the pocket-book, but Smith and Grimbley staid about two hours; they washed themselves, and put on their clean shirts.
COURT. Q. Do you mean to represent that both Smith and Grimbley remained after Kennedy went away? A. Yes, for about two hours - I had not got their shirts ready- I was obliged to iron them and air them, and they remained in the room. I was not examined before the Magistrate.

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Little Peter-street, I lived in Parker-street, Drury-lane, in July last, I know Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbly - I saw them all three in company, at the Bank public-house, in July last; the first time I saw them was about ten o'clock in the morning - I did not see them go away; I saw them again between twelve and one - I saw them enter the house, and they all three left together - they came in in a great bustle, and left in the same manner -I followed them to a house in Eagle-street; I did not see them enter the house, but I judged they had gone in there -I looked in, and saw Smith, Kennedy, and William Guest; I did not see Grimbley - the house has been a coal-shed, or something of that sort - the door parts in the middle;I touched the doors, and they went open; William Guest had some Bank notes in his hand, and Kennedy had a note in his right hand, and a pencil-case - I did not take notice of the pencil-case - I saw nothing on Smith; I advanced one step into the shop, but no further -

                  Guest
               



             was standing in the door-way of the glass door, which leads into the parlour; they were talking - I heard a voice say, "What do you want there? we don't want you;" I retired and went away - I imagine it was Kennedy's voice which spoke to me; I afterwards saw Smith, Grimbley, and Mr. Thomas, in a cab, coming out of Covent-garden - I saw Smith in six or seven weeks after, at the Bank public-house; I heard him talk about some money that Higgins, the officer, had taken from him - I said, "What money is that, Smith?" he said,"The money I was up at Bow-street for, that I got from Mr. Holmes;" he did not say how he got it, but he said it was somewhere in the vicinity of May-fair, or in May-fair.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which did he say? A. I will not be certain whether it was May-fair, or in the vicinity of May-fair; I have been a carpenter and joiner for nine years - I once lodged in Royal-street, Stangate, and worked at that time in the Belvidere-road; I had no shop there - I was preparing some roofs for granaries at Puddle-dock, for a gentleman in Thames-street; it is a dock which leads down to the Thames - it used to be called Pedlar's-acre; I have never been of any other trade - I am not a discharged Policeman; I left the Police honourably - I got my living as a carpenter previous to that, and since; I left the Police on the 22nd of February last - we had a rule of being at the station-house at eleven o'clock at night, but I was at my sister's, and imprudently stopped there all night: I went in the morning, there had been a disturbance at St. Martin's vestry-room, and the men were all called out - I met Carter, who said to me, "The inspector has suspended you," and I sent in my clothes and resigned; I refused to go before the Commissioners when Carter told me to go, but I consulted my friends, and resigned the next morning - my sister then kept the Bank public-house - I did not know the house before she took it - I certainly know it now - I have heard the term, a flash house, but I do not know what it means; a great many bad characters frequented that house - it was not at that sister's I slept the night before I left the Police - I have more sisters than one; I have not got my living as a carpenter ever since I left the Police - I have been living with my sister at the Bank for five or six months; I slept there, and my sister was good enough to keep me; I left it about five weeks before she did - I left it to go to St. Bartholomew's hospital; I have not been in the habit of hanging about at Police-offices - I was not at Bow-street office in July last; I went by, but I was not in the office.
Q. Upon your oath, were you not there with Higgins when Smith was discharged in July last? A. I was not, I knew he was discharged about six or seven weeks afterwards, but I did not hear it from Higgins - I have drank with Higgins, but not in July last - I suspected Smith was in custody when I saw him in the cab with Mr. Thomas; it was not Higgins who was with him, it was Mr. Thomas - I did not go into the office when he was examined - I disclosed what I heard him say in the public-house about a fortnight before the examination at Bow-street - I saw what passed at William Guest's on the 5th of July; I did not think it was all right, but I did not give any information of what I saw, because I thought I had nothing to do with it,; I had no interest in it; I consulted my father and my brother-in-law, who advised me to have nothing to do with it and I did not bother myself with it - Higgins came to me about it in October; I do not know how he knew that I could tell any thing about it; I told him then, because he said it would be the means of bringing the parties to justice; there would be no blame attached to me, and I should be in no danger - I did not tell in July, as I did not know how I might be served by characters of that description; my sister who did keep the Bank is now in lodgings in Bull Inn-court, in the Strand; they have not kept any other public-house since that; she and her husband lived in Royal-street, Stangate, before they took the Bank - and when I got the job in the Belvidere-road, I went to lodge with them - I am not in the habit of removing goods in the night for people - I believe there was a distress for taxes at the Bank public-house, in March or April last; I was living there at the time; I lent the persons who were legally engaged in taking the goods away, a hand to remove them; it was about two o'clock in the day; I do not think there was enough to pay the distress; I never removed goods from there of a night - I do not know Henry Phillips - I do not know a person named Calder, in Wild-street; I have seen a man who goes by the name of Mo; he used to resort to the Bank, when my sister kept it; I do not know what his name is - I believe he assisted in removing goods from there for a lodger up stairs, but it was by day-light, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; that was five or six days before the distress was put in - I do not know whether they had removed all the goods before dark; there might be some left till the next day; they were not my sister's goods, they belonged to the lodger, whose name was Wingate.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was it Smith talked about the money? A. At the Bank, about six or seven weeks after I had seen them in the cab - there might be seven or eight persons in the public-house; I did not think of asking him what he meant by saying he got it of Mr. Holmes - I thought it was remarkable to say such a thing in a public-house, but it was not my business - I thought he had stolen it, but I knew he had been examined at Bow-street, and as that was over, I had no business with it - if Higgins or any body else had come to me, I should have told them; I had told my sister and several persons of my own family, and they advised me to have nothing to do with it - I thought when Smith said it, it was done more out of bravado than any thing else; but I suspected it might be true, from his having been in custody - I did not ask him what Mr. Holmes he meant: I had seen him several times at the Bank, and I think I told my sister the next day, or the next night, after I heard him say it; but my sister had left the Bank then; I think she left it about a fortnight before I came out of the hospital - I think she left it in June.

Q. Did you not say you saw the three men at your sister's house in July? A. I meant the house that had been my sister's, and my sister was there that day with me; she only lived about four doors from it - I was there, having a pint of half-and-half; I do not know whether my sister was having any thing to drink - I had been home, and could not get in; I went there, and saw her standing at the bar, talking to Mrs. White, the landlady - I did not stay more than twenty minutes; I left her there, and followed the three persons to Guest's; I certainly thought things were not right, but I did not give any information and thought I had better let it alone - I have known Higgins for fifteen months, I suppose; but have not conversed with him respecting this trial, except when he asked me what I knew of it - when I heard the trial was put off, I asked him why he did not let me know; I was never a witness in a Court of Justice but once, and was once at the Westminster Sessions - when I was at my sister's I did what there was to do, and served in the bar; I knew the house was resorted to by bad characters, but I did not harbour them; the house was not in my control; my sister could not help their coming there - I was there when Higgins took a man named Donovan out of the house; I believe it was about a cloak, but it was not stolen in that house; I believe my sister kept the house eight or nine months; they paid as far as they could, when they went away - I believe they did not pay the rent; I helped the goods away when they were seized - nothing had been removed before but the lodgers' goods.
Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley among the company who resorted to that house? A. I have seen them there repeatedly; I have often seen bad characters there, and heard them relate their exploits to one another; it was very common - I left the house three weeks or a month before my sister did, and went to the hospital.

            ; we kept the Bank public-house - I did not know it by the name of a flash-house; very indifferent characters came there - Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley came there very often; on the 5th July, the day Smith was taken, I saw him with some money - I did not keep the house then; I used to go there very often to get in my debts; I saw Smith with some sovereigns in his hand, between twelve and one o'clock; I asked him to pay me what he owed me, which was 11s.; he used some very bad language, and said he did not owe me any thing.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you arrived there before your brother? A. No, I rather think he was in the house when I went in; I am not sure; I used to attend at the bar - I do not know what you mean by calling it a flash-house - I am very sorry I ever saw it; I lost my all there; I did not owe so much when I left it as was owing to me - I had not a good opinion of Smith, though I trusted him; I think my brother left the Police in the latter end of 1831; or it might be February, 1832 - we went to the Bank in November; and it was some time after Christmas he left the Police - he afterwards came to live with me; I kept him; he cleaned knives, and did any thing there was to do - I did not pay him wages; I gave him a shilling or two, now then - when I saw Smith there in July, I stopped about twenty minutes in the house; I think I left the house before my brother, but I can hardly recollect which went first - Higgins, the officer, has been there occasionally, when he came for prisoners; he has not been there every week - I have known him not to call for a month; I knew he took two prisoners there, who were transported, and four or five others; my brother was not there five months; he was there three - he knew of two being taken in the house, because we told him; I do not know whether he was in the house when they were taken; he staid with us till we left the house, or nearly so; I am not aware where he went to; he was ill while he was with us; he had a bad leg, but it got well about a month or five weeks before we left, which was in May - we went to live in Parker-street, which is the next street; my brother lodged with me in Royal-street; he took the lodging the same week I did - I think he was at the Bank at the time we left it, but I took no sort of charge of him, and do not know when he left - my goods were seized for ground-rent, which I imprudently did not see paid before I took the house; we had a lodger named Wingate, who left us about a week before our goods were taken, and in about a week after we left.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This house was frequented by bad characters? A. Yes, but I was not aware of it before I took it, or I would not have taken it; I left it very much reduced, because I had given credit to a great many persons - I tried my utmost to let the house before I left it; Smith owed me 11s. for board and for drink - I generally trusted good characters with more, but I stopped at 2s. with bad characters; I did not trust many bad characters - I believe my brother went to the house after I left it; he did not go much there that I know of -I remember Smith going away on the 5th of July, with Kennedy and Grimbley; I believe my brother followed them: I remained there then, but I meant I did not know whether my brother or I left first in the evening - I went there very often; I believe my brother did, though he did not board there; I have drank in the house after I left, but not often - I may have drank half a dozen times there: I generally drank porter; I might have taken half-and-half- I paid the landlady for what I drank; my husband is now very much reduced, and is obliged to work in a brewery - he never was in any trade; he never was a fighting-man: his brother is one.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were any prisoners taken in your house for any crime or misdemeanor committed there? A. No; my brother was not always there, but generally - Donovan was one of those who was taken, there was another taken at the same time; I always gave Mr. Thomas all the assistance I could: my brother went to St. Bartholomew's-hospital with his leg - I think he was there at the time we removed.

            . I live on Holborn-hill; I carry on business under the name of Spratswell: I am a tailor. On Thursday, the 5th of July, Smith came to my house with a taller lad, and then he came again with a smaller lad; he first bought a pair of white trousers - the next time the younger one bought a suit of clothes - I forget whether Smith paid me two or four half-sovereigns; I saw a considerable quantity of money in his hand; I think twenty sovereigns or more, and the other lad had as much - here is my book in which I made the entry at the time; my attention was called to it the same day by the officer.

JOSEPH HIGGINS (Police-constable F 35). I knew Smith before the 5th of July, and on that day I met him and Grimbley in a cab, in Holborn; I knew them to be thieves, and stopped them: they had each a new hat on, which took my attention first - it was about six o'clock, or between six and seven; I got into the cab, and saw a little bundle - I cannot say which of them had hold of it; it contained a jacket, waistcoat, and trousers, all new, and Smith had a new pair of white trousers on: I asked what they had in the bundle - they said some new clothes which they had purchased at a tailor's, and if I wished I might go there; I went in the cab to Mr. Spratswell's - I took them in there, and found that they had purchased such articles as were in the bundle; I then saw Smith had a watch in his pocket: I took it out, and asked how he came by it - he said he had bought it; I then searched him, and found in his trousers pocket fifteen sovereigns, and I found on Grimbley three sovereigns, but he had no watch - I left them in the shop, in the custody of a friend of mine, whose name I do not know; and I went to the cab, and found a green purse, containing twenty-five sovereigns under the cushion; I went into the shop, and said, "Here is a purse, do you know any thing of it?" they both denied all knowledge of it - I turned out the gold, and counted it in the presence of the shopkeeper; I got into the cab with them, and told the driver to go to Covent-garden station-house: when we got to the corner of Little Queen-street, I saw Kennedy come up to the cab, and halloo; I put my head out, and the moment he saw me, he appeared to bolt off - it appeared to me that he saw the others in the cab, before he saw me; they had several examinations at Bow-street, and were then discharged - Kennedy was out of the way for nearly a week.
COURT. Q. Where had you usually found him? A. At the Bank, and I at last found him there, playing at cards with William Guest; it might be about the 12th or 15th of July.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known Watts? A. Twelve or fifteen months; I have seen him in the A. division of Police - I have frequently been to the Bank to look for thieves; I have drank there when it is necessary, or we could not find them - I have been there thirty times a week sometimes, and sometimes not once; I cannot swear that I have not been a month without going there - I should think not two months, while Baldwin kept it; when I have been looking after thieves: I have gone in many times a day - I have been in when I was not looking for thieves; my own judgment or my own interest sometimes leads me to drink with thieves - I have never been told, as an officer, not to drink with thieves; I took up a gentleman some time ago as a suspicious character - I did not swear to him as a reputed thief; I charged him as a suspicious character, lurking about Covent-garden, but he turned out to be a respectable person, and I apologised publicly; he was locked up, but bail was taken for him - he admitted that he was in company with thieves, but he did not know them; I do not know his name at this moment, upon my oath - I should know it if I heard it; he told me he lived in a house in a court opposite Drury-lane theatre: he was a theatrical man I believe - I took twenty-five sovereigns to the Stamp-office on the same day that I took Smith; they were what I found in the cab - and the other eighteen sovereigns I have had in my possession ever since; I never offered any money respecting this prosecution - I never offered either of the prisoners any; I went to Smith's mother's house on the 19th of November: I found him in bed - I took him to Covent-garden station-house; I did not take him to any public-house, nor give him any gin.
Q. Did you ever tell Smith that if he would split and say where the notes were, you would make a man of him, and give him 20l.? A. Never in my life; I have known Kennedy eight or twelve months - I was not in Court when he was tried; I knew he was in Newgate, because he sent for me - I went to him once; I do not know that it is part of the orders to the Police not to visit convicted felons - I never received such an order, nor heard of it; I went to the bulks three times, and spoke to Kennedy, in the presence of the keeper of the ship - he had sent me a letter, and I asked him what he wanted; I believe Mr. Thomas has the letter - I took down an order with Mr. Capper's name to it the last time I went, but I said nothing to Kennedy about a pardon; he might speak to me about a pardon, but not on board the ship, not to my knowledge, not that I recollect; such a word never came from my lips - when I got him on shore I took him to a public-house at Greenwich, and gave him some dinner: I paid for it; I am in the habit of eating and drinking with thieves, but not living with them - Kennedy has no money nor friends; I have been obliged to feed him since I have had him in custody - I expect to be paid for it; I have sometimes sent him his breakfast, and sometimes he has come to my house - I have been once in a public-house with him since I brought him up; I will not swear I have not been oftener - I do not know that I have drank gin with him; if I have I paid for it; I have not drank rum with him -I never employed Watts; I have seen him at Bow-street, and on the evening Smith was under examination I think he came to the office with two or three more, but I will not swear it - there were several examinations, and I might have seen Watts once or twice.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know of any order that you are not to drink when on duty? A. There is an order that men are not to go off their beats to drink - I acted under the direction of the Magistrate with respect to the money - Kennedy was never in my house till I brought him from the hulks; I am compelled to feed him now, or take him to a cook-shop, or do something with him.

            . I am an inspector of Police, division A. On the 16th of November I went to the house of the prisoner Guest, in Belvidere-road - it has the appearance of a shop, but there are no goods for sale; it was about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - I saw Guest at the door; I told him I was an officer, and I had come to search for some notes taken from Mr. Holmes - he said,"Dear me, I am taken very bad in my inside;" he repeated it several times, and said, "Will you allow me to go backwards;" he stepped out towards the back door, and I saw his hand was in his waistcoat pocket - I went to him, turned him sharp round, and took from his hand this pencil-case; I searched his bed-room, and found two boxes, one large and the other small - there was 20l. in money and some valuable articles in each of them - he did not go into the yard after I took the pencil-case from him.

Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you examined at Kingston? A. Yes - I have always stated that I told him I came to search for notes which Mr. Holmes had been robbed of; I never stated that I said I came to search his house, without stating for what - I was there half an hour or more; Higgins was with me, and he had charge of the prisoner while the search was going on - I sent him in a hackney-coach to the watch-house; a person might have a thousand opportunities of getting rid of a pencil-case between July and November.

            . I produce from the Bank of England three 20l. notes, cancelled, which came in on the 5th of July, 1832 - one is No. 19,740, another 19,741 both dated the 24th of January, 1832, and the other is No. 19,843, dated the 10th of May, 1832; the name of

            , No. 42, Eagle-street, Holborn, is on each of them- I have no knowledge of who brought them.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you, of your own knowledge, state that they were brought in the state in which they are now? A. No, I did not take them in - they were cancelled by one of the cashiers, and are kept in the library; I received them to-day - it is impossible to say who made the memorandum at the time they were cancelled; I can tell by the ledger that gold was given for them.

             re-examined. I have seen 
               
                  William 
                  Guest
               



             write twice; I believe these words on these notes to be his writing.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did you see him write? A. At the Black Horse, Kingsland-road; he was writing, but I do not know what; and one evening I went into the Bank, and saw him with a thief - he had a watch in his hand, and he was making out a bill of something he had done for the watch-maker: this may be three months ago - I saw these notes the day before yesterday.
JOHN KENNEDY. I saw

             write these words on these notes.
MR. BODKIN to MR. LLOYD. Q. Had the stone ever come out of the head of the pencil-case before? A. No; the stones do sometimes come out, but this had not.
Guest's Defence. I am innocent - I received the pencil-case in the way of business, as a working silversmith, to put some chequered silver to it, to serve as a water-seal.

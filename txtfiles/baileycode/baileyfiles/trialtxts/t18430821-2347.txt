ELIZA PARHAM
. I am a widow, and live in Crown-street, Soho. At half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th of July, I was in my shop, and heard a bell ring, which I had attached to the door up stairs—I ran into the passage, and saw the prisoner going out with a bundle—I am sure he is the man—I ran out, and very nearly caught him—he threw the bundle down at my feet—other parties pursued, the policeman brought him back, and this handkerchief was taken out of his pocket—the bundle contained two scarfs, two shawls, and a cap—these are mine.





CHARLES BROWN
 (police-constable F 128.) I pursued the prisoner, and took him at the corner of Hart-street—I brought him to the prosecutor's shop, and took this handkerchief out of his pocket—she identified it directly—he said he was going by the house, was taken short, and went in to ease himself.

Prisoner's Defence. In passing this house, I saw a man run by and drop this handkerchief; I took it up and ran after him.





JOHN SIMS HANCOCK
 (police-sergeant E 12.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person—he was tried in the name of Cormack.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

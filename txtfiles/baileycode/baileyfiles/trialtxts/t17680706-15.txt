            . I live at the Horse and Groom in Portland-street


; I had a fall from a horse, and while I was in the hospital these things were missing from my room over the stable; they had a suspicion of the prisoner, I went and found him, and took him up; I charged him with having taken them; he said he had got them, and would return them, he said he took them out of mistake; he fetched them to me out of his lodging-room, and some out of the hay (the things produced and deposed to.)

            . I was the officer, I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoner; I heard him own he had taken all the things.
Prisoner. Before I plead I insist upon the things, I am tried for them, I shall not say any thing till I have them.
Q. Have you any body here to prove them your property.
Prisoner. No, I have not.
To his character.

                  ; 100 lbs. of lead, and one copper, value 25 s., the goods of 
                     
                        
                           William

                  CROWTHER
               



            . The house this property was stolen from is mine. I live in Charles-street; Middlesex Hospital


, next door to it. On Sunday afternoon, the 30th of July, about four o'clock, I observed the lead which covered the back-yard and had been fixed to it, was cut away, and put in the hall of the house; the copper was also unfixed, and put there. The person who inhabited the house had taken the key away. I found some blankets and curtains in the copper; the copper was tied in a blanket. About seven o'clock next morning, I found the prisoners in custody.


                  WILLIAM 
                  PERKINS
               



            . The blankets and curtains in the house are mine. I had lent them to the last tenant.

                  HOUSE
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Crowther. On Sunday evening he sent me and some more men to watch who would come; we waited in the opposite house. At three o'clock the officers left us, we remained, and at half-past five o'clock three men entered the house. We immediately went to the door, and found Plummer and Watts in the passage removing the copper; Green, who was the third, ran into the parlour and hid behind the door, I secured him; the others were secured. The lead had been cut up, and the mortar of the copper appeared fresh.


                  JOHN 
                  HUNTER
               



            . I am a coach-painter. I was upon the watch, and found the prisoners in the house. I secured Watts in the passage; he begged me not to ill-use him.


                  JAMES 
                  LYON
               



            . I secured Plummer in the passage.


                  WILLIAM 
                  HELY
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Crowther. I saw Green enter the house with a knot under his arm; the other prisoners let him in, they were inside. I informed the witnesses, they went in and secured them. They gave no account how they came there.


                  ROBERT 
                  CONNELLY
               



            . I am a labourer. I saw Green come out of the house with two more, on Sunday morning, at half-past seven o'clock, the day before the robbery.


                  JOHN 
                  JONES
               



            . The prisoners were brought to the watch-house with this property. I found a knife upon Green, and a crow-bar in the copper, which exactly fitted the door where it was forced.
GREEN'S Defence. I met Plummer in Oxford-street. A gentleman sent us to the house to fetch the goods. He went to get some beer, and we were secured in the house.
PLUMMER'S Defence. We met the gentleman, and he sent us to carry the load.

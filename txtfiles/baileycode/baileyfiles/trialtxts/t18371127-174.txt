 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of November, 1 work-table, value 1l. 8s.; and 1 other table, value 1l. 1s.; the goods of 



Joseph Boyce.






FRANCIS GOSTELON
. I know the shop of Joseph Boyce, I live very nearly opposite to it, in the Kingsland-road—on this day week I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner come out with two tables, one under each arm—I had not the least idea they were stolen. but Mr. Boyce was two doors off, and saw him and stopped him—I said, "He has surely not stolen them"—"Yes, (says he,) he has"—the policeman was just there and took him.





JOSEPH BOYCE
. I saw the prisoner crossing with the tables—I said, "What are you doing with them?"—he said, "Nothing"—he gave them up, and said he took them—they are mine.
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

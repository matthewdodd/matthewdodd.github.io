THOMAS MARTYN
. Between ten and eleven o'clock on Saturday night, the 23rd of July, I was near Aldgate, and had occasion to use my handkerchief—I took it out and put it back again—soon after I missed it—I turned, and saw the prisoner near me—I walked up and accused him of stealing it, and found it in the crown of his hat—this is it.


Prisoner. I had been to my uncle's, and as I came to Aldgate Church, two young men went past—they threw the handkerchief on the ground—I took it up, and the gentleman came and said, had I seen any body take his handkerchief—I said I had picked one up.





THOMAS MARTYN
. No, he denied having it—I saw no other person there.

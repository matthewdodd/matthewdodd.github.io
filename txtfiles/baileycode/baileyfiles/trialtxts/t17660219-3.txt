            . I live in Coventry-street


. The prisoner is brother to a servant of mine. A few weeks ago Justice Welch sent a constable for me. I went there, and this silver spoon was shewed to me. I know it to be my property. The prisoner was there: he owned he took it out of my house when he came to see his brother. I brought his brother from the West-Indies; they are both blacks. (The spoon produced and deposed to).

            . I was told on the 5th of January the prisoner had offered a silver spoon to an old cloaths man, name Flyn. I was sent for to Mr. Welch's; there was the spoon, prisoner, and Flyn. There the prisoner owned he took the spoon from out of one of Mr. Swinton's drawers, while his brother was gone to the pantry to get him some victuals.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

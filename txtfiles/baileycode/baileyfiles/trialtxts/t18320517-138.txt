            . I am an officer. On the 10th of April I was in Brick-lane, Spitalfields


 - I saw the prisoner coming along with another young man, with a great coat under his arm - I had not got many yards further before I met an old gentleman, who said he had stolen a great coat out of a cart; I turned after the prisoner, the other person who was with him ran off - I followed the prisoner down to Black Eagle-street, where I saw him with the coat on, and he tried to throw it off; I had seen him put it on.

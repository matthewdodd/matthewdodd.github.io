            . I drive a beer-dray
, and live in Wood's-place, Bowling-green-lane. On the 8th of May I left my dray in Tavistock-square


; I put my whip against some rails while I delivered some beer; when I came back, I missed the whip - I saw the prisoner at a distance; he threw the whip out of his hand; my fellow-servant pursued; I went round, and met him - this is my whip; I am sure he is the person.

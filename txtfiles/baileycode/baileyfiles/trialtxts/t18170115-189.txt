            . I am a patrol. On the 10th of January, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Rose-lane, Spital-fields. I met the prisoner crossing the road, somebody gave an alarm, and I stopped him with the cask of blue on his shoulder; I asked him what it was, he said, it was salt, and that he got it from Mr. Saltes, in Bishopsgate-street. I asked him, where he was going to take it; he said, to the corner of Angel-alley, Whitechapel, to a cheesmonger's. I told him, it was too heavy for salt, and took him to the watchhouse. I went to Angel-alley, the man said, he expected no salt, nor did he know Mr. Salter; the cask was examined and found to be blue.

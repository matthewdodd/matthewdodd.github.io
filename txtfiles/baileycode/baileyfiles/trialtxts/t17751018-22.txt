            . I am the wife of

            : my husband was formerly a peruke-maker; he has been afflicted with a palsy these six years, and I have maintained him by washing. I washed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) for Mr. Wilson, a grocer, in Bridge-street. The prisoner had carried linen for me several times. On the 22d of July in the morning, I delivered to him the linen mentioned in the indictment to carry home to Mr. Wilson. At nine at night, Mr. Wilson sent to me to know why I had not sent home his linen; upon that I had the prisoner taken up. When he was before the justice, he said, he sold the things to a Jew for thirty-six shillings.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not say any such thing. I took the things to Mr. Wilson's; Mr. Wilson was in the shop; there were four or five customers there, and he was very busy. I left the linen upon a hogshead in the shop.

            . About three Weeks ago I stopped the Prisoner at Kensington; said I, Willis, where is Capt. Clayton's Pistol; he said, he knew nothing of it; I told him, I knew he had the Pistol; and I would either have it, or secure him; at last, he owned. he had pledged it at the Three Balls in Drury-lane for half a Guinea; and he redeemed it.
Prisoner. When I met him, I told him I was going to redeem the Pistol; and that the Maid Betty had given it me to pawn.
Spire. I never asked him how he came by it.
Capt. Clayton's Maid Servant. We had some Workmen at the House, and the Prisoner used to come in, and talk to them;

            , a Woman that he keeps Company with, told me, he had the Pistol, which put me into a great Fright: I had suspected the Prisoner before, because he was absent for two or three Days; I did not miss the Pistol till two or three Days after it was gone; it was stole out of the Kitchen or the Pantry - I did not let him have it to pawn. 

               Guilty

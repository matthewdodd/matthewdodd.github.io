            . I was going, on the 7th of October, from Finsbury-square to London-wall


 - I felt some one touch me; I turned, and saw the prisoner immediately behind me, with my handkerchief in his hand - I accused him of stealing; he threw it down, and another boy, who had been with him, ran off - they appeared to be together, and were both so close to me that I cannot say which was nearest; this is my handkerchief.

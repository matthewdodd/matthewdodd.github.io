            . I am a cooper
, in Grub-Street. The prisoner was my servant
. The things mentioned in the indictment were missing; I charged the prisoner with it, and she took me to the pawnbroker's where she had pawned them. I told her, if she would let me have my things again, I would make it as easy as I could. The constable found two spoons in Barbican; I found the rest.

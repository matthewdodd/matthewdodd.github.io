            . I am a Scotch Factor, and my premises are at 55, Lothbury



. I left them at a quarter before eight o'clock on the evening of Saturday the 28th of July; the property was then all safe. I returned on Monday morning, at about half past ten; there are three locks to the outer door of my premises, a top one, a bottom one, and one in the middle. I usually unlocked the middle lock, but when I put in the key, I found it was not locked; I had locked it I am certain on the Saturday night. I could neither unlock the top nor the bottom locks, they were both spoiled. I suspected all was not right. I accordingly went to the back part of the premises, and perceived the doors which I had locked on the Saturday evening, were broken open. I got in, and on examining the goods, found twenty seven dozen pounds weight of thread, and one hundred and seventeen yards of linen gone. The whole of what was taken away was worth forty pounds, and what I got back, might be worth eighteen pounds.

            . I am a City constable. On the 30th of July, at about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, I saw a chaise cart standing at the door of the Punch-bowl, just opposite Little Queen-street in Holborn. There was a man in it, and presently I saw 
               
                  George 
                  Scarr
               



             come out of the house which is his father's, and the man in the cart gave him a large black canvas bag which appeared to contain bundles of something and which he took into the Punch-bowl. On the Tuesday morning following, I accompained Salmon and Wilson, two other officers, with a search warrant at about six in the morning, to search the Punch-bowl, Old Scarr's house. Salmon told him, we came to search his house, and he said very well, and he would accompany us, and he would just go and call his wife, to mind the business. He went up stairs, we followed him close and met him just coming out of the room where his wife was in bed, with the same dark canvas bag in his arms which I had seen his son carry in on the Sunday morning. Salmon told him to put it down, which he did, and I was sent to call Davis, the clerk to the prosecutor, who was waiting outside; he came in immediately, and said the contents was his master's property. I searched the bedroom, and in a box, I found a quantity of linen,which Davis also said was his master's property. The father told me that a man named 
               
                  George 
                  Madden
               



            , brought the goods into the house, and his son carried them up stairs, as he did not choose to trust Madden up. He said, if we went to the public-house where they both slept, in Angel-alley, we should find them there. Soon after we went to that public-house, and 
               
                  George 
                  Scarr
               



            , was in the bar; we told him he must go into the tap-room, and sit down, which he did, and we asked the landlord's permission to search the house; he said, by all means, and we went into George's own room. The bed was not made, and only appeared to have been slept in by one person. In his box, I found this bunch of skeleton keys, and these bottles of phosphorus; I knew it was his box, for his shirts were in it, and when we were taking him away, he wanted a clean shirt out of that very box. We told him not to mind it then, as he could have it another time. He then went with us.

                  SALMON
               



            . I am an officer, and was with the last witness, at the execution of the search warrant at Old Scarr's house and at the apprehension of George. Old Scarr behaved very civily. Wilson was with us.


                  JOHN 
                  EDMOND WILSON
               



            . I am an officer. I was with the two last witnesses at Old Scarr's house, and afterwards in Angel alley, to get young Scarr. I searched a cupboard in the back room on the ground floor; Old Scarr was with me; before I opened it, he said there was nothing there belonging to this business, but said he would go and fetch the key to unlock it; I told him there was no necessity for that, and would not let him go; I took out a knife to open it, but found that it was not locked. In this cupboard, there was a piece of green baize, under which I found these three separate parcels of linen, each of them wrapped up in a silk handkerchief. I said to him, that this is what we were in search of. I next searched the bar, and there I found a pound of whitey-brown thread, and a remnant of linen. I then searched the cellar, but found nothing there. Here are all the things we found.

            . I live in Wood street, Cheapside, and on Sunday morning, being about to accompany a party of friends, upon an excursion of pleasure, I set out at about a quarter before six in the morning. As I passed the door of the prosecutor, I observed a one horse cart standing there with a man in it; presently, I saw two men bring a dark canvass bag, out of the house, and put it on the shafts of the cart, and the man in the cart took it in; presently a fourth man came, brought something and put it into the cart, and they then drove away with only one in it. I was taken to Newgate subsequently; and thought the prisoner 
               
                  George 
                  Scarr
               



             was one who assisted in bringing out the first parcel.

                  DAVIS
               



            . I am clerk to the prosecutor, and identified these things to be his property, when they were first found, at 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Scarr
               



            's. These things were consigned to his care, by Mr. Morrison, and Mr. Brooks, of Edinburgh.

Thomas Scarr's Defence. I knew nothing of my son having deposited these things in my house.

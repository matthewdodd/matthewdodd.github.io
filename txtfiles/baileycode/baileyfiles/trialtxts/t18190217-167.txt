            . I am an officer. On the 15th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was passing the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner, in company with three others, and watched them; one went into the shop, and came out again, then the largest boy lifted the prisoner up to look over the window. In about two minutes I saw the prisoner go in upon his hands and knees, he went round the counter, got up, and took the bowl off the shelf. I crossed over, went in, and took him, as he was coming round the counter with the bowl before him; the others ran away - there was 22 s. in in it.
Prisoner's Defence. I never touched it.

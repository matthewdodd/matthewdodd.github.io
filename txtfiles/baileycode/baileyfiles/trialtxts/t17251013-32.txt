             thus deposed: The Prisoner (one Sunday) desired me to fetch her down the Bible, which I did. She sat down to read, and so I left her; and neither saw nor miss'd the Bible till Thursday, and then I ask'd her what she did with it? She said she put it upon her Partner's Bed on the Monday Morning; but it could not be found. I sent for a Constable, and had her before a Justice, thinking that might bring her to confess what she had done with it; but she deny'd it stiffly; and as I could not prove it upon her, the Justice discharged her. The next Day she arrested me for Scandal; and I was forced to carry my Cloaths to pawn, to pay the Charges. I beg'd of the Pawnbroker to let me have as much as ever she could upon my Things, because I was arrested. She ask'd me for what? I told her it was for charging a Woman with taking a Bible that was lost. A Bible, says she; What was the Woman's Name? Rachel, says I. Rachel! And what besides Rachel? says she. Why Pearson, says I. Ay, says she; And do you know the Bible when you see it? Yes, says I. Why then, says she, I'll shew you a Bible that was pawn'd here in the Name of

            : So she brings me a Bible, and it was the very same that we had lost.
The Pawnbroker deposed, That the Prisoner pawn'd that Bible to her for 6 s.

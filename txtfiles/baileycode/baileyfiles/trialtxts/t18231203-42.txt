            . I keep a grocer's shop
 in Mare-street, Hackney


. On the 4th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, going out at the shop-door, and immediately followed him. I lost sight of him just while he turned the corner - he ran as fast as he could. I followed him nearly a mile, and he was stopped. I had seen him throw down the till, but ran by it, still following him - it was brought back to me, with the money and weights stated in the indictment.

            . I am a miller. I was going out of Maides' shop. I saw him running after the prisoner. I joined in pursuit, and saw him throw down the till, money, and weights in a lane, and picked them up.

            . I am a journeyman baker, and stopped the prisoner, who was running - nobody was running before him. Maides came up and charged him with stealing the till - he said nothing.
(Till and weights produced and sworn to.)

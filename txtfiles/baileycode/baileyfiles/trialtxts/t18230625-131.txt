            . I live at Nuntley, in Gloucestershire. On the 24th of June I was looking at the fire in Featherstone-buildings


, and had a handkerchief in my pocket. The constable spoke to me. I felt, and missed it - he had hold of the prisoner.

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre. I stood at the corner of Turnstile


, and saw the prisoner with another. Mr. Chadwick stopped to look at the fire - the prisoner and one Newman went up to him; the prisoner took hold of his pocket, and immediately drew this handkerchief out, and tucked it up his jacket. I stood close behind and laid hold of him with it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a butcher
 in Newport-market


; I lost three legs of mutton, and three pieces of beef, out of my shop last Thursday, about five o'clock in the morning; I found the shop broke open; I was informed my meat was in White-chapel; I went there and found it in the care of a watchman; I am sure it was my meat; I knew it by the cutting.

            . I am a watchman; I stopt the two prisoners in a street at the back of the Minories, with this meat upon them.
The prisoners acknowledged the charge.
Both 

               guilty

This Day three Weeks I went out about 12 o'Clock, and left the Door of my Room double locked, and when I came back I found it broke open; this Poker was at the Feet of the Bed, and the Staple of the Lock in the middle of the Room. The Prisoner lodges on the same Floor, and this Poker belongs to her Room: she confessed she had pawned the Cotton Gown to Mr Matthews, and sold my Stays to a Woman in the Street, for 4 s.

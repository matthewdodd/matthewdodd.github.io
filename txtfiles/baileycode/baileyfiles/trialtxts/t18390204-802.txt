JOSEPH WILLIAMS
. I am a farrier, and live in Bowl-mews, Lisson-grove, and keep fowls. They run outside in the mews—I missed one cock on the 29th of January—I saw it again in the afternoon—this is it—I have had it ever since Michaelmas—(looking at one.)





GEORGE MESSENGER
. I met the prisoner in Stingo-lane—he asked if I knew any one who had a Bantam hen and Bantam cock to change for this fowl—I asked him what sort of cock it was—he said it had its comb cut, and it was a speckled comb—I went home, and told Mr. Williams—I then went to the prisoner's, waited till he came home, and he went and brought the cock out in a bag.





GRORGE SAMPSON
. I met the prisoner with the cock—I went to him, and insisted to look at it—I brought it to Mr. William'S with its legs tied.




GUILTY

                  John 
                  Swallow 
               



            . I am overseer of the parish of St. Margaret's Westminster. The prisoner was a nurse in the workhouse
 belonging to the said parish, our board sets every Thursday night; during the time they were fitting, there was complaint made, that eighteen sheets were missing. The maron said, she believed the prisoner had taken them out of the house and pawned them. She was sent for down, and charged with so doing, and before the board she own'd she had carried some out to pawn. The gentlemen desired I would take her before justice Manly the next morning. She confessed she had taken ten sheets out of the workhouse. I went to the justice to desire him to grant me a search warrant, which he did; then I took a constable with me, and we went and search'd at Mrs. Adams's, a pawnbroker, in College-street, and at Mrs. Griffith's, a pawnbroker in Tothill-street; we found five in each place, mark'd with the parish mark, SMW. ( produced in court.)
Q. Did you find any thing else?
Swallow. We found a check'd apron at Griffith's, and two linen shifts at one Cooper's.

Q. What are you?
A. Fletcher. I am matron there; the prisoner had taken these things out of the house and pledged them.
Q. How do you know that?
A. Fletcher. Because she owned it, and directed us to the pawnbrokers where we found them.
Q. Are you sure they belong to the house?
A. Fletcher. Here is the house mark upon them.
Q. Was you present when the woman was examined?
A. Fletcher. I was, and heard her acknowledge she had taken them, but not with an intent to defraud, but to bring them back again.

Q. Did you know her before?
M. Adams. I did.

            . I am a constable. The overseer sent for me after the prisoner was taken up. I went to the justice, who granted a search warrant, and we went to these pawnbrokers, and this linen here produced was delivered to me.

Q. What did the prisoner say for herself ?
Wicks. She said, she had nothing to say for herself, only that she did intend to redeem them again.

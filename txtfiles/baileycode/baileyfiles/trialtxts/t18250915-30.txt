THOMAS KYBERLY PRITCHARD. I live in Burlington-street. On the 18th of July, as I was passing in Oxford-street


, a lady, who is present, told me my handkerchief was gone; I felt my pocket and missed it; she pointed the prisoner out - I seized him by the collar - he denied it the first time, but I persisted in saying he had it - and hepointed to it lying on the ground, about half a yard from him - this is the handkerchief.

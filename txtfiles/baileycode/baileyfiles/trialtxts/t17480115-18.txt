            . On the 6th of January last, about a quarter after one at noon, I was about two hundred yards below Ludgate, and the Prisoner took my handkerchief out of my right hand coat-pocket.
Q. What reason have you to charge the Prisoner with it?
Power. I heard a person say, your pocket is picked; I turned about and saw the Prisoner endeavouring to conceal the handkerchief between his coat and waistcoat.
Q. How near was the Prisoner to you then?
Power. About three yards.
Q. Did you take it from him?

Power. No; other people came up, and he dropped it.
Q. Did you take it up?
Power. No; but another did who saw him take it out of my pocket, and he was immediately secured.
Prisoner . Ask him whether he saw me drop the handkerchief.
Power. I can be positive that I saw him have it in his hand, and one corner was hanging out thus, and then I saw him drop it.
Prisoner. The gentleman searched me all round.
Power. I never touched you.

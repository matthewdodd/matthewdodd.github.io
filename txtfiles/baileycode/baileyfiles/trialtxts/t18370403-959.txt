WILLIAM WALKER
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
27th of February, 1 spoon, value 3s.; the goods of 



William Bagshaw.






CATHARINE ROLLSTONE
. I am shopwoman to William Bagshaw, a confectioner in Tottenham-court-road. On Monday, the 27th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked for a custard, which I gave him with a silver teaspoon—he eat it in the soup room, and stopped about five minutes—I went into the room immediately he was gone, and found he had taken the silver spoon and left this metal one—I went to the door to look for him, but he was out of sight—we have two

metal spoons, but they are never used in the business, and are not like this—the prisoner was brought to me by the policeman, on the 8th of March, and I knew him again—I am certain of him—I have not found the spoon.





THOMAS WYLIE
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner to Miss Rollstone, who recognised him as the person who took away her spoon—it has not been found.




GUILTY
. 


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Lord Chief Justice Tindal.

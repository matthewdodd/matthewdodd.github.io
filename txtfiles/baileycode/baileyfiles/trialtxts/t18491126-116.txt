WILLIAM WANT



, stealing 2 pairs of stays, value 5s.; the goods of 



James Smith: having been before convicted.






JAMES SMITH
. I am a staymaker, of St. John-street. On 21st Nov., about eight o'clock at night, I heard a cry of "Thief!" in the shop—I was in the kitchen—I ran up-stairs, and when I got outside the shop I saw my stays on the pavement—they were hanging up inside the shop door before—the prisoner was taken, and brought back to the shop.





WILLIAM HUNT
. I live in Church-row, St. Luke's. On 21st Nov., about eight o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner about six feet from the shop door—he dropped the stays, and ran off—I followed, and caught him—he is the same man I saw drop the stays—he said, "What do you want with me?" and struck roe—I took him to the prosecutor's—I never lost sight of him.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw a lad start from the door, and heard a cry of "Thief!" I thought if I stayed where I was I should be taken for a thief, on account of my having been convicted; I ran, and a man caught me.





JOHN KEEVIL
 (policeman, L 179). I produce a certificate—(read—John



Sullivan, convicted of housebreaking, Jan., 1849; confined nine months)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

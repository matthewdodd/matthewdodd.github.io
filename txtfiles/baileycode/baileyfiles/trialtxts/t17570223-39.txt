            . I live in Castle Yard


, Hounsditch, my husband's name is David. I took the prisoner in my house on this condition, that she'd do a little for my children. I went out a nurse-keeping, and to make passover cakes for our Jews. I taxed her with taking the things mention'd, and she confess'd it, and said the white apron she had pawn'd for a shilling, and the colour'd one was lost; the shift she had then on.

            . I heard the prisoner confess before the sitting alderman, that she had taken the things mention'd away.

They may say what they please. I never saw a farthing of their money. The cloak and colour'd apron I had, and lost them at market.

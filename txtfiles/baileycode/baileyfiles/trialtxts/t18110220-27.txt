                  SMITH
               



            . I am a painter and glazier, I live at No. 2, Little Moorfields.
Q. On the morning of Sunday the 5th of February were you in St. Paul's Church-yard - A. I was, about seven in the morning, I was going into Cheapside, I there saw the two prisoners at the bar, they were a little separate they were talking to each other, and walking in one direction. I was in Cheapside, I saw them going towards Foster Lane, whether they came out of the Old Change or St. Paul's Church-yard I cannot say, Potter had a bundle under his arm in a cotton handkerchief, Potter stopped and looked up Foster-lane as if for a direction, Aaron went a little before making a sign to him to follow him; Potter followed him and I followed him, and I followed them both to watch them: they came to Gutter-lane, Potter made another stop as if to go down there, and immediately Aaron beckoned him on again, he followed him again to Wood-street. They went down Wood-street, Aaron taking the right-hand side, and Potter the left. The Jew went into Lad-lane, Potter stepped forward and over shot Aaron, he looked back and turned down Lad-lane after Aaron; when they both took down Lad-lane, I stopped at the corner, I heard Aaron say, there is somebody watching us, give me the bundle; Potter give him the bundle, and Aaron put it under his coat. Aaron said to Potter leave me, Potter did not leave him but kept a little behind, he separated and went on the opposite side behind, I kept close to Aaron - they took to King-street, along Cateaton-street, and then to the Old Jewry; they both then kept of the left hand side of the way, and went into the Poultry, they went through the Poultry up to Goodluck's in Cornhill, there they separated at the corner of the Bank buildings, Aaron took Cornhill and Potter the Bank-buildings, I kept close to 
               Aaron
             all the way, he might have heard my steps if he was not deaf, his eyes were upon me all the way, when Aaron got to the Royal Exchange door he dropped the bundle, and I picked it up.
COURT. Was Potter in sight then - A. I saw him looking at the corner, and when I picked up the bundle he decamped. When Aaron saw that I picked up the bundle he went away quick down one of the alleys by the Exchange. I looked over my shoulder, and saw Potter at the corner of the Bank buildings, he saw me pick up the bundle, and I saw no more of him, he saw me pick it up. I found the bundle heavy, opened it and saw it was metal, which I afterwards found was silver. This is the handkerchief it contains the silver. On the next day I went to Rundle and Bridge, Ludgate-hill, and there I found the owner of the property I delivered it to Mr. Fox, their clerk. On Wednesday I went to their manufactory in Dean-street, I saw the prisoner Potter, I am sure he is the man.
Q. Did you describe the person of Potter before you saw him - A. I did, Potter was sent into a yard where there were other persons; as soon as ever he made his appearance, I said, that is the man, I am positive he is the man I saw with this bundle. Aaron was taken up on the Monday following, I was present when he was apprehended in Crown-court, Wardour-street. Aaron perceived me looking at him he held his head down, when I saw his face, I was sure he was the man I saw with Potter.

            ; our manufactory is in Dean-street, Soho. Potter was in our employ in that manufactory, and had been for four years.
Q. For some time before this transaction was discovered had you missed silver from your manufactory - A. Yes, we had, I had no suspicion of Potter, he was our porter.
Q. Upon this being brought to you by Mr. Smith, this that is produced here to day, were you confident it is your property - A. Yes, I am. The silver was in the possession of Mr. Smith, at Ludgate Hill; I went there and saw it, they are our patterns, we had some patterns peculiar to ourselves, the weight of it is one hundred and twenty seven ounces, the value is upwards of thirty pounds.
Q. These pieces that you have there are theycalled silver cuttings - A. Yes, they are, in the trade; they are our patterns. We never sell them in that state; we melt them down. I have no doubt of all of them being mine.
Q. When Mr. Smith came to you did he describe to you the person that he saw - A. He did, and upon that I sent Potter into the yard; Mr. Smith selected Potter immediately. Potter was taken into custody. When we walked out to his lodgings Foy the officer accompanied us; he confessed that he had stolen a few ounces of silver, which we should find at his lodgings; he denied the silver he was charged with. Afterwards, in consequence of something Potter said, I sent to Mr. Smith, and we had Aaron taken in custody.
- FOX. I am clerk to Rundle and Bridge. I received them cuttings of Mr. Smith.
Potter said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.
Aaron said nothing in his defence; called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.

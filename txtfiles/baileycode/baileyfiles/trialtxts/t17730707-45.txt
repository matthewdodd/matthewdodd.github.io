            . I am a watchman. About three in the morning of the 29th of May, Stevenson called me to his assistance; he had taken the prisoner with the coals on his back; I saw them; there was about a bushel.

            . About half after two I saw the prisoner go down on Mr. Hurford's wharf empty; I watched him and saw him come back with the coals; I stopped him with the bag on his shoulder; he shewed me the craft he took them out of; I did not see him go into the craft; he flung the coals on the ground and ran away; I pursued and took him; I charged him with stealing the coals; he did not deny it, but said he would carry them back to where he had them, and would have gone back if I would have let him.
Mr. Hurford. On the 29th of May the two witnesses informed me they had taken a man who had robbed me of some coals; I saw the prisoner afterwards and he acknowledged he took them out of my craft.

I get my bread by picking up coals; I picked them up in the dock.

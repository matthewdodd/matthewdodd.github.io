             of Greenwich, December 30
.
Jeffery. I was going the 30th of December over London-Bridge; opposite to the new Building upon the Bridge, I was forced to put up in a Door Way, to get out of the Way of the Coaches: I had no sooner got up in the Door-way, but a couple of Fellows rush'd, the one behind and the other to one Side of me; I striv'd to get into the House, the Prisoner kept me from going back, and the other from going forward. They took an Opportunity, one of them, to pick my Pocket of 20 l. When the Coach was gone they went off. I had the Presence of Mind to clap my Hand to my Pocket, and I found my Money was gone. I cried out Stop Thief. In running I fell down, but got up again. This Williamson, the Prisoner, makes into a Pinmaker's Shop at some Distance; as soon as I cry'd out Stop Thief, I saw a couple run; and one, that is the Prisoner, went into the Pinmaker's Shop. He endeavour'd there to pull his Coat off, I suppose to disguise him-self: He ask'd to buy some Pins. Asking to buy some Pins, the little Boy calls to the young Man: But he did not want any: But the young Man seiz'd him: And when I came up, I said, you Rogue, you have robb'd me, where is my Money? Says he, I have not robb'd you, but you have, says I: Look down there says he, there is your Money. One of my Witnesses pick'd it up.
Q. Where was your Money, in a Bag or Purse?
Jeffery. It was in this Bag. The Bag was produced in Court.
Q. And the Money that lay at his Feet in the Bag, was the Money you lost out of your Pocket?
Jeffery. Yes, my Lord.
Q. Do you know any Thing more?
Jeffery. We carry'd him into the Haberdasher's House, and we charg'd a Constable with him.
Q. Had you any Talk with him afterwards about it.
Jeffery. He sent People to get me to be favourable to him.
Q. Was it taken by Slight or by Force?
Jeffery. By Slight.
Prisoner. Did you see me about your Pocket?
Jeffery. To the best of my Knowledge you are the Man.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Jeffery) Did this Person threaten you?

According to your Expression they pick'd your Pocket. Was he taken into Custody?
Jeffery. Yes.
Q. Then neither of these threaten'd you, but only took this Money out of your Pocket by flight of Hand? This cannot possibly be any Robbery; that must be a taking with Violence. This Indictment is for a Robbery on the Highway.

            . Please you, my Lord, I live with Mess. Hood and Dale on London-Bridge. On the 30th of December, about Five in the Afternoon, all of a Sudden, I heard a Noise of Stop Thief; upon hearing which I run out of our Warehouse: I catch'd the Prisoner at the Bar by the Collar, and turn'd him on one Side of the Door Post; I held him a few Minutes before the Gentleman that lost his Money came up. You Rogue, says he, you have robb'd me of 20 l. I look'd very sharp at him, but had not the Wit to search him. The Prisoner said he had not got the Money; but before these Words were out of his Mouth I catch'd the Bag between the Spar of the Post and my Foot; upon which I directly call'd to Mr. Jefferies, and said, here is your Money, and gave it into both his Hands and bid him hold it fast. I held the Prisoner still fast by the Collar; and Mess. Hood and Dale were both at Home, and I call'd my Master out of the Compting-House into the Shop. My Master came up; I bid Mr. Jeffery take the Money, and they told it over and it was exactly 20 l.
Prisoner (to Payne.) Did you see me drop the Purse?
Payne. Before the Words you express'd to Mr. Jeffery, There is your Money, were out of your Mouth, I catch'd it between the Spar of the Post and my Foot.

                  James 
               



            . Please you, my Lord, on the 30th of December, 'near Five in the Afternoon, I live between half way of the Pinmaker's and where Mr. Jeffery was robb'd: I saw Mr. Jeffery fall down and get up again dirty. I heard him cry out Stop Thief, Stop Thief. I saw the Prisoner at the Bar run into the Pinmaker's Shop. I was but a few Minutes after him before I got to the Door. A Woman cry'd out, there is one run in there.


                  Q. 
               


            (to James.) Did you go into the Pinmaker's Shop?
James. No, I stopp'd at the Door, and then the Prisoner had almost got his Great Coat off.
Q. What happen'd after he came out of the Pinmaker's?
James. 
               
                  Henry 
                  Payne 
               



             was before him and I was behind him. I saw the Money taken-up by 
               
                  Henry 
                  Payne 
               



            . After the Bag was taken up I went to Mr. H's; was with him all the Time. The Gentleman of the Shop he follow'd. The Prisoner said he was then going over into the Borough.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) Have you any Witnesses?

                  Hollis 
               



            . I was going over the Bridge when this Aff happen'd. I up near the Shop; standing up, absence of People were coming by. This here Gentleman had a wherein Coat upon his Arm. The Coach was one. There was a Couple of Men push'd by me. I saw a Man with a whitish Coat upon his Arm; I saw an elderly Man, upwards of Forty: I saw another Man, Sir, run under the Horse's Belly, the other Side of the Way; and directly some body halloo'd, Stop Thief: And two Men went, and the elderly Man in a brown Coat dropp'd something in a Bag; then directly the Crowd come.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Hollis) I would ask whether this something that you saw drop by the Man in the brown Coat was dropp'd before or after the Prisoner was taken by the Collar by 
               
                  Henry 
                  Payne

                  Q. 
               


            (to Hollis) Do you know any thing further?
Hollis. I made the best of my Way home, and when I came home I told my Neighbours how I saw an innocent Man serv'd. They told me the best Way to serve the Man would be to enquire whether he was in Consinement: Accordingly I did, and went to Newgate and gave a small Trisle, a Sixpence, to enquire about him.

            ) How long have you been acquainted with the Prisoner at the Bar? What is his Character?
Tow. The Way I was first acquainted with him was, he bought a Dozen or two of Shoes of me; he deals in the Country. This Man has dealt with me, Times, ever since, and I know nothing amiss of his Character, he has paid me very honestly for what he has had.


                  Q.

                  Powell 
               



            ) How long have you known the Prisoner? What has been his Character?
Powel. All that I known of the good Man is, that he used to deal in the Country. He used to sell cloth, and deal in all manner of pedsing Things.
To this Evidence a Gentleman in Court objected, That an Evidence own Character ought to be enquir'd into, as he was a Person that kept a disorderly House.
Upon this the Court mov'd, That if he attempted to give the Character of the Evidence, he must be sworn.

            's Character?

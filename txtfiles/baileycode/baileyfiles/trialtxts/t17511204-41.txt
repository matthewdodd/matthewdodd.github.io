Honoured Madam,
'' THis comes to inform you, that I am the unhappy person that pawn'd your things, tho' '' I did not take them, and humbly beg your pardon, '' and Mr. Humphrys's.

Dear madam, do but say you forgive, and I know it is done, tho' I am not worthy '' of it; and after asking your pardon and Mr. '' Humphrys's, I ask also my shopmates pardon.

            . When Mrs. Catley brought that letter up, she sent us out to see if we could bring her with us, and she would make it over as a debt, as she had done before by her sister; if she would confess to the things We told

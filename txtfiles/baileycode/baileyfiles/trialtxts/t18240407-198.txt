            . I live at the Red Lion public-house, Type-street, Chiswell-street


. On the 28th of February I lost three rabbits out of the hutches in the outhouse. The lock was picked - three belonging to Harris were stolen from the same place. I saw the skins of all five at Worship-street, and knew them. Lee used to work in the neighbourhood.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoners in one room together. Lee was in the act of taking the entrails out of the rabbits. Harris stood by; it was Lee's room - he lives about seventy yards from the Red Lion. Holden said he had only come to look at them.

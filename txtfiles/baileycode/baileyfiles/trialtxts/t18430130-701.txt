MR. BODKIN
conducted the Prosecution.






MARY MOORE
. I am single, and carry on the business of a tailor and draper, at Newark. The prisoner was my journeyman for about a year and a half—he lived near the premises where I carried on my business—I used to pay him for each article he made, according to the usual prices—about two months ago 1 hired a room in his house, to deposit some of my property in—I paid him 1s. a-week—the rent of his house was 2s. 1d. a-week—I put the goods in that room, which I have since seen in London—perhaps 1 had 150l. worth of goods in the room—I fastened it with a padlock outside, and kept the key myself—on Wednesday, the 11th of Jan., I went to the prisoner's house to tell him I wanted him to make a coat—he said he would go, cut it out, and make it, and come to me next morning—he did not come next day

—in consequence of that, I went to his house the next Friday—he was not at home—the door was locked—I thought he was gone to some friends—I went again three times that evening, but always found the door locked—I went again on the Saturday, and found it still locked—on Monday morning a parcel came to my house—it contained the key of his house—I went to his house with the key, and went into it—I went to the room in which my property had been deposited—the door was locked, the same as usual—I unlocked it with my key, and on entering the room I missed all this property stated in this indictment—I have seen the articles mentioned in the indictment, and I identified them as being mine—the prisoner had no authority from me to remove this property, or do any thing with it—he had no business in the room at all—I communicated with my brother, who came off to London.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your brother here to-day? A. Yes—I still keep a tailor's shop—I am unmarried—I hired this room of the prisoner to put my things in—I had let five rooms in my own house in which I had kept part of my goods—I will swear I moved the goods to his room, on account of my letting these rooms, because I had not room for them—I had a shop, a small sitting room, and three up-stairs rooms of my own at this time—here are seven or eight packages of goods here—they would all go in one room easily enough—I know a person named Battam—he resides at Newark—he did not mark any of these goods—he is an acquaintance of mine—I have known him thirty years—he is seventy years old—I only know one person of that name—my son marked some of these goods—my son has never gone by the name of Battam—he is now on his death-bed—my shop was shut up—I cannot tell the date—these things were moved from my house to the prisoner's occasionally as it suited me—they were not always removed at night—they were sometimes—my business was not in a very successful state, nor in a very unsatisfactory state, but I was afraid it might be—I was in debt—I might owe 200l. or 300l. my son keeps the books—I owed Mr. Bell, the banker 80l. I might owe 300l. to my brother, but I do not know—I do not keep the books—these goods were not removed exactly for the purpose of avoiding an execution for these debts—I was rather afraid of my brother, or of the Bank, at least—I might have told the prisoner that I wished these goods to be put into his house to avoid an execution that I expected from my brother—that was not my only reason—another was that I had let part of my house—the Bank had threatened me with law proceedings—I partially removed the goods to avoid the threatened execution—I have never paid the prisoner with cloth when I owed him anything—I do not know that he told me he did not understand the law, and was afraid of getting into trouble—I will swear he did not—I do not recollect that he ever said so—I did not tell him he need not fear, I would make it all right—I do not believe his wife said so, nor that either of them did—I never knew from him that these goods had been booked at Deacon's warehouse, for London—on Sunday evening, the 15th of Jan., I saw a woman named Sarah Crawley at Newark, between six and seven o'clock, I went to her house to inquire—it was dark—there was a man with me—he had a bunch of keys—I borrowed a candle from Mrs. Crawley—she might have asked me who the man was—I do not recollect that she did—I might have told her he was a particular friend of mine, a Mr. Gibson—he tried the lock of the prisoner's door—we had asked leave first of the landlady—I sent for another man named Revell—we picked the lock, and went in—Revell picked it—I believe Mrs. Crawley paid the man for picking the lock—the prisoner had been very kind to me in opening the shop for me, and I gave him flannel, and several things—I thought I was indebted to him for what he had done—I think I gave him a

coat to come up to London, about three weeks ago—he said he would come and work six weeks in London, till work was brisker, and then he would return—I never told Mrs. Crawley that I had entrusted the prisoner's wife with the key, in order to remove the goods, nor any thing to that effect—the lock was picked, because they had taken the key away—they returned the key in a parcel with a note—I gave the parcel which contained the key to my brother—I employed the prisoner to teach my son the art of cutting—I gave him one waistcoat piece for that—I only gave him one—I paid him what he demanded—I paid him with this waistcoat—he was only an hour or two teaching him—he made no charge at all—I do not believe that my son brought the key of the room on the 27th of Dec. to the prisoner's wife—this is the first word I ever heard about it—the prisoner's wife might have removed some of these things from the room to my house—if she did it, it was by my directions or my son's—if I wanted them either to sell or use, I should have them again—she never got them unless I was with her—I do not know whether I ever went to the prisoner's house of a night to remove goods to my shop for the purpose of sale on the market days—I might fetch some—I will not swear whether I did or did not on the 12th of Jan.—if I did they were my own—I swear I never employed the prisoner and his wife to bring my goods up to London, or to remove one single article.





REUBEN MOORE
. I am the brother of Mary Moore; she carries on business as a tailor, in Newark—some time before this, she was in my debt to the amount of 270l. or 280l.—about three weeks or a month ago, I bad an execution out against her—I took her goods which were assigned me by the Sheriff—that was before these goods were taken away—I got what value I could under the execution—I had not interfered by my execution, with these goods that were in the prisoner's house—she made a communication to me about the removal of this property, and in consequence of that, at her particular request, I came to London after the prisoner—I in the first place went to Guildhall, and got the assistance of M'Lean the inspector—I arranged to be at the Castle and Falcon to see who would claim the goods—the prisoner, his wife, and a man who described himself as a porter, who I believe is a relation of theirs, came and took away each of them a package—they contained part of this property—the inspector and I followed them—they took them out of the yard to where the prisoner lodged—we went up stairs, and opened the boxes there, and found goods which I can swear were my sister's—part of them had been bought of me.

Cross-examined.
Q. Does your sister owe you anything now? A. There is the claim for the money for which I am bound at the Bank, to the amount of about 60l.—I became bound about two or three months ago—I cannot say whether it was before, or in Nov.—I realized 200l. and odd by my execution—I cannot tell when I levied it—I do not know whether it was before or after 1 became bound to the Bank—I did not know my sister had removed any of her goods, or I should have levied the full execution—a very few shillings or pounds remain of my own debt—I have not got any account or claim that I made on her—I think the Sheriff levied for 210l.—the goods were assigned to me, and are in my warehouse at Newark—she had other creditors—I cannot tell how many—I should think she now owes about 300l.—the goods that are here are worth about 50l.—the whole of the goods the prisoner is charged with stealing are above 100l.—he has pledged a good many here, and part at Nottingham—I gave the bankers a bill for 60l. odd, at twelve months date—I did not know at that time that my sister had been concealing her goods, or I should not have given the bill.


MR. BODKIN. Q. At the time these goods had heen removed had you been pressing against her? A. No.





FRANCIS M'LEAN
. I am inspector of the City-police. A complaint was made to me by Reuben Moore—I went with him to the Castle and Falcon, and found packages of goods—the prisoner, a woman, and a man claimed those goods—each of them took one of the packages, and carried them away—I followed them to Fox-court, Aldersgate-street—I there had these packages opened, and found they contained these goods—the prisoner was there at the time—I told him why I interfered, and Moore gave him in charge for stealing his sister's goods—he laughed and said they were his, and he was quite ready to show us—he had the key—we went into an adjoining room, and found some more goods, and on the mantelpiece I found some duplicates—these are them.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you say any thing about finding them, before the Magistrate? A. Yes, they were handed to the Magistrate—I do not recollect the prisoner's saying he was employed by Mrs. Moore to bring the things to London—he said she was endeavouring to conceal them from her creditors, and when it was found out, he was employed to remove them to London—he said he had a great deal more to say.





JOSEPH WOODHOUSE
. I am a pawnbroker at Nottingham—some of these goods were pawned at Nottingham, part on the 13th and part on the 14th of Jan., by the prisoner—three of these duplicates refer to them.

Cross-examined. Q. How much did you lend him on them? A. 3l. 14s.—they consist of woollen-cloth and three coats.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

MR. CLARKSON
called






SARAH CRAWLEY
. I am the wife of a tailor, living at Newark—I have known the prisoner two years—Mrs. Moore came to my house on Sunday afternoon—I asked if she had got into the house—she said no, she wished to have the lock picked—she had it picked, and asked me to pay the smith for picking it—I did so—she went and came out again to my house—I asked what she missed—she said, "Well"—she did not exactly say what she had—and she said the prisoner had always been very kind to her, and she had given him a great deal of goods for himself—I said, "Why?"—she said, "If you could not pay your journeyman on Saturday night, what should you do?"
(Philip Hooper, tripe-seller, Long-lane, Smithfield; and Mary Ryan, Short's-gardens, Long-acre, gave the prisoner a good character.)

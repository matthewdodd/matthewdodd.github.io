            . I live at Mr. Martin's, an optician in Fleet-street. I was coming home on the 10th of May, at past eleven at night; near Shoe-lane


 I felt a twitch at my coat; I turned round, and saw the prisoner drop my handkerchief. I took it up. There came an elderly man to me and said, Have you lost any thing? I said I had not, for I had got it. He said, Then let him go. I held him, and called the watch.
Q. Do you know who the prisoner belongs to?
Wright. His father is a taylor. He has applied to me, and said if I would let him off he would send him to sea.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming up Fleet-street, having been drinking with my brother. I saw two other chaps by the gentleman. I walked on and got between him and the chaps: his handkerchief was about half way out. He turned round, and said I was going to pick his pocket, and called the watch. I am about sixteen years of age: I lodge with my father in Rolls Buildings, Fetter-lane. I am a stick maker

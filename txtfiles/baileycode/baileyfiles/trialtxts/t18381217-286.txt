HENRY WINTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of December, 1 firkin, value 4d.; and 65 lbs. weight of butter, value 3l.; the goods of 



Henry Hughes; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM PLAISTOWE
. About half-past five o'clock on the afternoon of the 4th of December I was in Fenchurch-street, opposite Billiter-street—I saw a man put this tub of butter en the prisoner's shoulder in Billiter-street—I went after him—the other man made his escape—I stopped the prisoner, and took him—I found the owner—he lives close in that neighbourhood.





SAMUEL HANCOCK
. I was in Fenchurch-street, and saw two men about the prosecutor's door—I believe the prisoner was one—I thought there was, something going on wrong, and I watched a minute—one of the two persons took a cask of butter out of the cart on his left shoulder, and crossed the road—I endeavoured to follow him, but lost sight of him—in turning up Billiter-street I saw a man with the cask of butter on his shoulder, who I suppose was one that was about the cart—the officer came and took him.





HENRY HUGHES
. This butter was taken out of my cart, which was standing facing Mr. Cook's door—I am only the carman, but it was in my cart.

Prisoner. I was turning the corner—a man came and asked me to carry it—he said he would give me a shilling—I took it, and followed him—be made a bit of a run and I was seized—I never saw him before—I am aware I have got a bad character.





JAMES DOUFTY
. I am an officer of Farringdon Ward. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was the officer that took the prisoner—he is the same person that was tried.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN JONES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of April, 1 till, value 1s.; 1 shilling, 2 sixpences, 8 pence, and 20 halfpence; the goods and monies of 



James Cochrane.






ELIZA PRESTON
. I live with Mr. Cochrane, who keeps a baker's shop in Frances-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 18th of April I was in the parlour, and heard the rattling of the till, which was kept behind the counter—I looked, and saw the prisoner on his knees pulling the till out—I did not call out, because I did not know who it was—we have a boy, (Martin Cochrane,) and he had a playmate now and then—I believed the prisoner might be at play there, but he was not—I saw him go out of the shop—William made an alarm, and I found the till on the floor behind the counter—the prisoner was pursued, and brought back—I had seen the till all secure two or three minutes before—I am positive the prisoner is the boy.





THOMAS GREENHAM
 (police-constable F 27) About ten minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner running fast through Cleveland-street, pursued by some butchers, and brought back—I went to the door, and found he had taken a till—I took him into the shop, and found the till behind the counter—Eliza Preston said she heard the money rattle, and saw the prisoner on his knees, drawing the till from the counter, and somebody came in—William said, "That boy is a thief"—

the prisoner then ran away—we found in the till eight penny pieces, and ten pence in halfpence, two sixpences, and one shilling.





JAMES COCHRANE
. I was not at home when this happened, but this is my till—the prisoner is a perfect stranger to me—he is not a playmate of my son.

Prisoner. I was going up Cleveland-street, and a boy saw me, and told a butcher to bring me back—I knew nothing of it.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

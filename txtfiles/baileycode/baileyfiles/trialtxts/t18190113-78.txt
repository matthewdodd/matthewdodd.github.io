            . I lodged with George Hubbard, in Queen-street, Chelsea


. On the 10th of October, my apartments were broken open and robbed. The prisoner worked for my master, and ran away on the 12th. I never saw him again till the Tuesday week; I then collared him - he struck me two or three times. With great perseverance I got him to a public-house, and gave him in charge.

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I went out on the 10th of October about eleven o'clock; I returned about three, and found the door broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone. We live in the first floor. I found some of my things had been pledged and redeemed at Mount's.

            . I am a labourer at Millbank. Last Tuesday week I heard the call of stop thief; I saw the prisoner strike Knowles a violent blow on his mouth - I assisted in securing him.
ROBERT FOX. I am servant to Mr. Mount, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in York-street. On the 10th of October, the prisoner pledged with me, six gowns, a quilt, two shawls, and a handkerchief. They were afterwards redeemed by another person.
TABIATHA HUBBARD. I am the wife of 
               
                  George 
                  Hubbard
               



            . Knowles and his wife lodged with us. On the 10th of October, I was at home all day. I heard a strange step coming down stairs, went to see who it was, and saw the back of a man going out at the back door, which goes into the street; I went up and found the room in great confusion. Sometime afterwards, the prosecutrix came home and said she had been robbed. I told her, a tall man with a blue apron went out - I thought it might be her husband. The man was the same size as the prisoner. He appeared to have a fustian jacket on.


                  JOSEPH 
                  KNOWLES
               



            . I know the prisoner wore a blue apron and a fustian jacket.
Prisoner's Defence. I lived with the prosecutrix three days before this happened, and met her the Sunday after; she said nothing about it.

             re-examined. I was not with him. He was taken into custody at Mr. Lyn's office; and said if I would not hurt him, he would pay me 2 l. out of his first pension. The officer and him persuaded me to make it up. The officer said he thought I might do it, as I had not been before a magistrate. He gave the officer 2 l. and the officer gave me 30 s. - I do not know his name - When I got home, my husband said I had done wrong.
TABIATHA HUBBARD. The prosecutrix was attending a sick woman at the time, and could not be living with the prisoner - I never saw any harm of her.

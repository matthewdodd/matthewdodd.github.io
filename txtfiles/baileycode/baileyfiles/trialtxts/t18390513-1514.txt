ELIZABBTH ANN CROWDER
. I am the wife of Nicholas Crowder, we keep a clothes-shop on Saffron-hill. On the 3rd of May, about ten o'clock at night, I was coming home, and saw the two prisoners at my shop-window—I had a broken square of glass there—I saw Connor with her hand up to the window, trying to get a pair of shoes out—I saw one of the shoes hanging out of the broken pane—I said, "What are you about? you are after no good"—Connor said, "What do you want to accuse me of; do you want to send me away?"—they said, "Search us"—I did feel, and found nothing—they abused me very much, and said I was a false-swearing Jew b—I was about to let them go, when a neighbour called out, "There is something white hanging from one of them "Tighe then said, "Give her a drive," and they went off—I knocked at my window, and my husband and my little boy followed them—I then missed a shirt—this is it—(looking at one)—it was taken from the window—there was a piece more glass broken out.





THOMAS TRIGO
 (police-constable G 214.) I saw the two prisoners running—I caught Connor, and made a grasp at Tighe, but she got from me, and another person took her—this shirt dropped from her in my presence.

Tighe's Defence. I was coming by, and saw the shirt on the rails—I took it, and put it into my apron—they called "Stop thief"—I turned back with it and dropped it.

Connor's Defence. I was going home—this girl said she had got a shirt she had picked up—I know nothing about it—we were not at the window.

E. A. CROWDER
re-examined. They were standing still at my window, and one had got the shoe in her hand—I had not been out ten minutes—I saw the shirt a quarter of an hour before.

TIGHE—


GUILTY
.* Aged 17.

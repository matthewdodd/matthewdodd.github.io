DANIEL SULLIVAN



, stealing 1 coat, and other articles, value 2l. 8s.; the goods of 



William Kirby; and 1 coat, and other articles, 2l. 2s.; the goods of 



Thomas Holmes: having been before convicted.






THOMAS HOLMES
. I am a labourer. On Saturday morning, 11th Jan., I went from my lodging at eight o'clock—I left my things safe in my room, in a box which was not locked—I came back about five in the evening—I found my box pulled out, and all my things were gone—I missed two coats, and other things—these are my boots—this waistcoat is my brother-in-law's, William Kirby's—he slept in the same room with me—I have known the prisoner about seven years—he did not live in that house—he came there once with a shirt—his mother made some shirts for me—I found this pair of shoes in my room, they belong to the prisoner; I had seen them on his feet—directly I saw them in the room, I said, "These are Sullivan's shoes," and gave information.





WILLIAM WILSON
. I am in the service of Mr. Gibbs, a pawnbroker. I have a coat, waistcoat, and pair of trowsers pawned by a female in the name of Ann King, and a pair of boots pawned by a man—I do not recognise the prisoner.





JAMES ABRAHAMS
 (policeman, S 296) I took the prisoner—I told him it was for robbing Holmes, at Westminster—he said, "If I had known that I would not have come this way"—I took him to the station, and he said, "If Holmes had been quiet he would have had all his things back again"—I know a young woman named Ann King—she is a prostitute—I have seen her with the prisoner—he lived at 15, Ashley-street—that is the direction on the duplicates.





CHARLES RANDALL
 (policeman, N 172). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Feb., 1848; confined one year)—he is the person—he has been in prison three times since.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

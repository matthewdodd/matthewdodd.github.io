            . I live in the Eight-Bell-yard, St. Giles's.


 On the 14th of June, between three and four in the morning, I heard my dog bark very much, in my gallery: I got up and opened the door, and saw the prisoner go along the gallery, and take down the stockings mentioned in the indictment: there being no way down but by me, I laid hold of her arm; she said, What do you lay hold of me for, fellow? I said they belong'd to me: she dropt them down, and said, Then there lies your stockings, fellow. I secured her; there is no gates to the yard, nor no fastening to the stair-case: it is a very large yard; the stockings were my property. There were five pair she had got belonged to another person, but we did not put them in the indictment.
Prisoner's Defence.
I and my husband had some words; he is a man that is very ready with his hands; I ran into this yard, and sat down on the stairs; this man came out in his shirt, and behaved very rude to me; he took hold of my arm, and went to push me up stairs; I did call him fellow.

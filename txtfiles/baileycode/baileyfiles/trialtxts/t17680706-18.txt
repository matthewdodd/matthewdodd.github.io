            . I live in North Audley-street


, I lost the harness mentioned in the indictment, about the 26th of May, out of my yard; one of my coachmen said he saw a watchman take a man with some harness to the Round-house; I went there, and saw the prisoner and harness (produced and deposed to.)

            . I am a watchman, I stopped the prisoner in the street between one and two in the morning, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, with this harness, in Tyburn-road; I took him to the Round-house; he said he was carrying them to Bishopsgate-street, but did not say for who, or to what house.
Prisoner's defence.
A well-dressed man desired me to carry the harness to the Bull in Bishopsgate-street, he was a stranger to me; he said his name was Jourdan; I was to have eighteen-pence, and he gave me two-pence to get some drink.
To his character.

            . I am a serjeant in the guards. I have known the prisoner between eleven and twelve years, he did once work in the King's Mens, after that he went to sea; I never knew any ill of him, I look upon him to be an honest man.

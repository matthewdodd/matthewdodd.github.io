            . I am a shoe-maker
, and live in Cannon-street; the prisoner lived in my service in November. I suspected him. I sent for him on the 28th of November, and told him I suspected his accounts were not correct-he was a shoe-dresser
; he said they were correct. About an hour afterwards I told him I was going to send for a constable; he said, if I would forgive him he would tell me something. The constable came.
JOHN PEARSE. I live with Mr. Sadler, in Aldersgate-street. On the 14th of November, the prisoner pledged a pair of shoes at our house, I took them in. He was in the habit of coming to the shop.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

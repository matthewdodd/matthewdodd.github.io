            . I am apprentice to Mr. Samuel Adams, hatter
, High-street, Shoreditch


. The prisoner was working there as a bricklayer's labourer
, and about four o'clock in the afternoon, of the 9th of September, he went into the public-house next door, with his own glazed hat on - he came out again without a hat, and came to work in my master's cellar - I saw him come out of the cellar and blow out the light - he then had a hat on which was my master's, and had been kept in a bag in the cellar - he went into the public-house again - I told Mr. Adams - he went to the public-house, but the prisoner was gone - the next day he came to work, and we gave him into custody, - the hat has not been found.
Prisoner. I have no recollection of taking the hat.

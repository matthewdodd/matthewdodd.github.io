, on the 26th of March
 last. It appeared that the Prosecutor kept the Py'd Bull Alehouse in Vine street


; that the Prisoner and her Husband (who was a Barber in the Neighbourhood) were drinking there with other Company, while the Prosecutor was abroad. The Prisoner left them a little while. They thought she went into the Yard; but one of the Company heard her cough as if she was in the Kitchen. When she came back, she said, Did not you hear me cough? Yes. I thought so; and yet I stuff'd a Handkerchief into my Mouth to prevent it, and then I crept in upon my Hands and Knees. The Company could not imagine what the Woman meant by such odd Expressions, till the Prosecutor came home and miss'd his Nest of drawers. She was the next day examined, and confest the Fact, and where she had carried the Goods and Money.

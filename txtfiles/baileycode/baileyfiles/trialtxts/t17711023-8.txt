            . I keep the George and Vulture tavern, Cornhill
; on the 3d of July we missed the two table-spoons; the prisoner lived with me then as a porter
; he left me on the 28th, or 29th of September.

            . I am servant to Mr. Axford; the prisoner gave away some sugar-candy to a girl, who brought it into the shop again; we then searched the prisoner's box, which was at the stable, there we found these two spoons, (producing two spoons broke to pieces.)
Prosecutor. They are my property, I bought them of Mr. Barton my predecessor; they are marked with a B in the bowl.

            . I was fellow-servant to the prisoner at the George and Vulture; we lost two spoons, marked as these are, at the time he lived there; when he was accused with stealing them, he said he found them in the dust or dust-hole.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found them when I was in liquor, just as they are; I kept them in my pocket two months; I never thought any thing of them till after I left that place; I put them in my box; I did not know that they were silver; my box was not locked.

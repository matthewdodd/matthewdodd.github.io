SARAH ANN WAKLING
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
30th of March, 1 shift, value 1s.; and 1 pair of boots, value 1s. 6d.; the goods of 



George Wright.






ANN WRIGHT
. I live in Castle-street, Bethnal-green, and am the wife of George Wright. The prisoner is my daughter by a former husband—she was going away from me on the morning of the 30th of March, and I stopped her—I found my boots between her petticoat and stays, and she had my shift on—I had not allowed her to wear it—she had a pair of slippers on—I have tried every thing with her—I have got her situations and a trade, but she has got into bad company—she has left me before, and I have found her in streets and lanes.





THOMAS BURCHEN
 (police-constable H 33.) I was on duty in Castle-street, Bethnal-green—I was called by Mrs. Wright, and took the prisoner to the station-house—in going to Worship-street she said to me, "Have you seen her?"—I said, "Who do you mean?"—she said, "My mother"—I said I had not since Saturday—she said, "If she does any thing to me she shall rue it; I don't mind two years in the Penitentiary," and she made use of language not fit to be repeated.




GUILTY. * Aged 16.—Recommended to mercy.



Transported for Seven Years.

THOMAS WHITE. I am a carpenter

 - he frequently visited me; he came on the 1st of August, but I was not at home; the next morning there was a silver table-spoon missing - it had been used on the Sunday, and was in the dishes - he had dined with us on the Sunday - and invited himself to dine on the Monday.
Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I came there on Monday to dinner? A. Yes.

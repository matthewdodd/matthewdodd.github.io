THOMAS COMBS
. I am shopman to Henry Pige, of West-street, Bethnal-green. About half-past one o'clock, on the 24th of April, I was standing inside the shop—I saw the prisoner and another boy standing outside the door—the other boy went up to the door, took down a shawl, and gave it to the prisoner, who put it into his apron—I caught hold of the prisoner—he struggled some time, threw the shawl down to me, and ran away—it was my master's—the officer came and took him.

Prisoner. It was not me; the boy took the shawl, and this man came and caught hold of me; I walked away; he came after me; I told him it was not me.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

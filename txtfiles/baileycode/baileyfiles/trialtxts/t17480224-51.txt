            . I live at the Gentleman and Porter


 in Fleetstreet


 ; the Prisoner came into my house on the 24th of February between eight and nine at night, and called for a pint of beer; I ordered one of my boys to draw him a pint; he sat for some time, drank his beer, and came by me, and went out; I enquired of the boy
 whether he had paid for it; he said he had not; I followed him down an alley, and found my mug in his bosom, and took it from him; if the beer had been paid for very likely the mug might have been carried off. I have had my mug again, and I hope the Court will be as favourable to him as they can.




               Guilty 39s.

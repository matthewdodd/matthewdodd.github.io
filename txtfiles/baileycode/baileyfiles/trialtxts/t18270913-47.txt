            . I am a butcher and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green, next door to Mr. Cushway. On the 13th of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner stand leaning against Cushway's window, and having some suspicion, I took him into custody, and in his hat found a gown and two handkerchiefs, and a veil in his pocket - I gave him in charge.

            . I am the son of 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Cushway
               



            . I was at work in the house, and being alarmed, I found the prisoner in charge - I walked behind him to the watch-house, and saw a handkerchief fall from his person; this property was taken from the window, which somebody had broken - it was quite whole at twelve o'clock. I had not seen it after that time.

            . I know these things to be my husband's property; he is a clothes salesman - I was out at the time of the robbery.

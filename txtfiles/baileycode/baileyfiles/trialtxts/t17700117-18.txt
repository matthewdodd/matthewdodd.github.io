            . On the 18th of December, I was at Guildhall


. Just as they had done drawing the tickets, at twelve o'clock, the prisoner was talking to me about a minute or two before, concerning what tickets had been drawn. Presently, Mr. Pain came and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, you have had your pocket picked. I felt, and said, I had lost my neckcloath out of my pocket. Pain ran and laid hold of the prisoner, and said, he was the man that had got it. The prisoner denied it; and Mr. Pain took and pulled it out of his breeches.

            . I was in Guildhall. I saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's neckcloath out of his pocket, and put it into his breeches. I told the prosecutor of it; and took it myself out of his breeches. (produced and deposed to.)

GEORGE WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of Nov., 3 pairs of boots, value 18s., the goods of 



William Ager; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS KELLY
. I am a carpenter, and live at Charles-street, Hatton-garden. On the 19th of Nov., about five o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour, and my wife called my attention to the door—I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Ager's shop with these boots in his arms—I stood outside on purpose to see him—he walked off—I asked if Mr. Ager had sold any boots—I then went after the prisoner—he dropped the boots, and ran across the street—a man intercepted him, and I came up to him—he said he was not the boy, and begged to be let go—I took him, and the boots were taken up—these are them—I am sure he dropped them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How came you to be there? A. My wife called me—Mr. Ager has got one side of the house, and I have the other shop—I was not more than a yard from where the prisoner came out.





ROBERT PARSONS
. I am a leather-cutter, and live in Baldwin's-gardens—I saw the prisoner on Saturday afternoon, the 19th of Nov., enter the prosecutor's shop at five minutes before five o'clock, while I was talking to Mr. Ager

—Mr. Kelly called to ask if he had sent a boy out with boots or shoes he said no—I ran after the prisoner—he dropped these boots—I took them up, and carried them back, and handed them to Mr. Gover.





JOHN GOVER
. Mr. Parsons handed these boots to me—I marked them, and delivered them to Mr. Moredale.





WILLIAM AOER
. These are my boots—I had seen them safe about three o'clock.





EDWARD MOREDALE
. I am constable of Ely-place—I took the prisoner, and had these boots delivered to me.





ADOLPHUS LONSDALE
 (police-constable F110.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Clerkenwell—(read?)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

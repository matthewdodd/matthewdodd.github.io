John Bennett: having been before convicted.






CAROLINE BENNETT
. I am the wife of John Bennett. I am a washer-woman—on 28th July, I sent my daughter Mary Ann Bennett with some articles to Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel—she returned crying, and the things were all gone—they had all been in my possession—these are them (produced).





MARY ANN BENNETT
. 1 was sent with this basket of linen—I got as far

as Cannon-street—the prisoner came up to me—I knew him before—he said, "Do you know what it is o'clock?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Come down this street"—when I got there, he said, "Will you go to that public-house, and get a basket for me"—I went, and left my own basket behind—when I came back my basket and clothes were all gone, and the prisoner too.





SAMUEL RICHARD SHEPHERD
. I met the prisoner on the night of 28th July—he said, "Will you carry these things for me?"—I did so, and he went away—I began to cry, and the policeman came up and took the things—I am sure that the things the policeman took, are what the prisoner gave me.





JOHN CHURCHILL
 (policeman, C 187). I saw Shepherd crying—he gave me these things.

Prisoner. 1 know nothing about them.

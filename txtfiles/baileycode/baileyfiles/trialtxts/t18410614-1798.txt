MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecutor.






GEORGE WATMOUGH
 (police-constable L 105.) I hare been an officer for some years. On the 17th of May I was on duty in Hooper-street, Lambeth—between eleven and twelve o'clock I was walking towards the Farm House beer-shop there—I had heard there had been a man robbed of his watch there, and was going towards the house to make inquiries—about ten yards before I got to the house I was met by the prisoner Popham, who I saw come from a house of ill-fame opposite—I knew his person—he came up to me and said, "You b—, you shall never reach the house," and instantly struck me a violent blow on the side of the face with his fist—I had offered no violence whatever to him, either in language or act—after be struck me I endeavoured to seize him—he was making his way towards the door of the Farm House—I laid hold of him and struggled with him, in the course of which he knocked my hat off with a life-preserver, which begot out of his left-hand breast pocket—he then made another blow at me, which cut me just above the temple, on the left-side—it was a very heavy blow—it cut my head, and blood followed—I still kept my hold of him—he made another blow at me—I caught the life-preserver with my right-hand, and saved the blow—I continued to struggle with him, and whilst doing so I saw the prisoner M'Phane come from the beer-shop—I knew his person—he drew something from his pocket, and struck me a violent blow on my cheek, just below the temple, which felled me to the ground—it appeared to be another life-preserver—that was whilst I was straggling with Popham—the blow was on the same temple—it tore my cheek and fetched blood—I still had hold of Pophara, and we both fell together—while I was on the ground I received another blow from M'Phane, which took effect on the arm, and made me leave go of Popham—I should say it was with a similar instrument to the one I had taken from Popham—it was not his fist, it was something more heavy—as I was raising myself to get up, I received a blow on the hand from M'Phane—I was then attempting to seize him—Popham had got away from me—the blow cut my finger in two places—he struck me two or three blows on the hand—while endeavouring to secure M'Phane, Donoghue came up—Popham had then got away—M'Phane only was with me—I saw Donoghue come from the beer-shop, while I was on the ground, and he kicked me very violently about

the body—I was not struggling with M'Phane at that time—I could not lay hold of him, because of the blows on my hand—he was going away at the time Donoghue came up—I did not get hold of M'Phane at all—Donoghue did not make use of any expressions at the time he kicked me—he kicked me several times—I also knew Donoghue's person well—I was exhausted with all this beating, and they all three got away—I was not able to seize Donoghue from the state in which I was—I was on the ground about five minutes after they left me before I was able to help myself—I then got assistance from Jones, 141 L, and went with him to the Farm House, where I took Donoghue into custody—he was standing at the bar when we went in—as soon as he saw me come in he ran into the tap-room, and hid himself behind the door—after securing him I went with Murphy to the lodging of M'Phane, in Short-street—I observed there was a light at the lodging, which was extinguished as we went in—I went into the second-floor front-room, and found M'Phane there in bed—I took him into custody, and told him what I took him for—he said, "I knew I should be nailed for this—I shall only be fined—if it is 5l. I can pay it, or if it is 10l. I can pay it"—I did not myself take Popham—a warrant was lodged for him at another place next day—we found where he was in about a fortnight, in the City—he has been brought here by Habeas to be tried—here is the life-preserver which I took from Popham—I went to Mr. Wagstaff, the surgeon, and he kept me off duty for five days—I felt very weak—I lost a deal of blood—for seven days after that I was only on reserve duty at the station—I have entirely recovered now.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Do you mean to persist in saying that you knew Popham before? A. I do—I did not take up another man instead of him—I took up one Matthew Allen, because he said I should not bring Donoghue out of the house—he was discharged—I did not take him up in mistake for Popham, nor was he discharged in consequence of not being the person, nothing of the sort—I seized Popham as he was going towards the beer-shop—that was after he had struck me the blow with his first—it was in the midst of the struggle with him that he struck me with the life-preserver—M'Phane and Donoghue asked the Magistrate if they could be allowed bail—bail was not taken—Popham was never before the Magistrate at all—he was in the Compter for an assault, and was brought here to take his trial without going before the Magistrate—M'Phane was not admitted to bail because the security was not good—the Magistrate agreed to admit him to bail—I found Donoghue and several other persons in the beer-shop—I did not find any person who had stolen a watch—the struggle with Popham was on the pavement, opposite the beer-shop door, close by—no one came out of the beer-shop at that time but M'Phane.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. How was the man dressed who came up and struck you with a life-preserver? A. Popham was dressed in a brown cord jacket—it was just after Popham and M'Phane left me that Donoghue came up and kicked me—directly Donoghue came up M'Phane ran away—he did not come up while I was struggling with either of the others, but afterwards—Hooper-street is a close confined street—there is no great deal of light—there are only two lamps in the street—I was about seven or eight yards from the beer-shop at the time Donoghue came up to me—I was then lying on the ground exhausted and very faint—I was unable to rise—I lay there for about five minutes—when M'Phane and Popham came up there was not a rush out of the beer-shop—I was about

ten or fifteen yards from the beer-shop when Popham first came up to me—there was not a number of persons came out of the house at that time, not till after I sprang my rattle.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHAKNOCK. Q. How long have you been a policeman? A. Nearly five years and a half—I have often been a witness—I was never a prosecutor before—this occurred about half-past eleven o'clock—I am quite certain about the time—it was a little girl that came out of the house who told me a felony had been committed at the beer-shop—she is not here—she was a perfect stranger to me—she did not see transaction—she was about one hundred yards from the beer-shop—there were no persons present at the time the prisoners assaulted me, not a soul—that I swear positively—not near me—William Cotterell was there, and when I called on him he ran in doors and shut the door—he was not there at the time of this assault—he was standing at his own door when it began—he did not remain there above two minutes before he shut the door—he shut the door before I was struck with the life-preserver—as soon as I received one blow from Popham's fist I went up to him—Cotterell might have seen that blow for what I know—he did not see any more that I know of—I cannot swear he did not see the striking with the life-preserver—I do not know of any one else being present—I will swear William Herring was not there—I was sober—I am positive as to the identity of M'Phane—I know him well—I am positive he was the second man who assaulted me—it was a darkish night—I was twenty or thirty yards from the gaslamp—M'Phane was dressed much the same as he is now, for what I know—he might have had that coat on, or something similar to it—I cannot say whether he had a black or blue coat on, or a black or white handkerchief, or what kind of trowsers he had—I did not take that notice—I have not sworn that he had corduroy breeches on—I went to the beer-shop as soon as I got assistance from a brother-Constable—I remained at the beer-shop about two minutes—after lodging Donoghue at the station, I went direct to M'Phaue's lodging—I knew where he lived—when I went into his room the light was out, and he was in bed—this is not the first time I have stated the expression M'Phane made use of—I stated it at Union Hall, I swear that—the charge there was an assault—I did not lake up any one besides the prisoners and Allen—I took Allen for bringing Donoghue out of the beer-shop, he was not charged with this offence—I am quite certain of that.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who is this Mr. Cotterell? A. He lives at the house adjoining the Farm House beer-shop—if he had come forward to my assistance when I called him, I could have secured two of the prisoners if not the three, but he went in and shut the door—I have known M'Phane these five years.





JOHN LOADER
. I have charge of the Farm House beer-shop, for Mr. James Silverthorn, the landlord—he does not live there—I am put in to manage it—we have a tap-room. On the night of the 17th of May there was a row in the house about half-past eleven o'clock, about a person losing his watch—I saw Watmough about twenty minutes after that, bleeding—he came in for some persons who had assaulted him—the three prisoners had been in my beer-shop that night—they went away about half-past eleven—Popham went out first, M'Phane next, and Donoghue last.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Were there a number of persons

in the beer-shop that night? A. Yes, from seventy to eighty—I had very great difficulty in clearing the house—I turned them all out as fast I could.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHARNOCK. Q. What time did Popham leave? A. It was about twenty-five minutes to twelve o'clock I should say, when first missed him, about that, within a minute or two—I am quite certain M'Phane did not leave prior to that—I am able to tell the time each man left, because I never left the tap-room from the time of the first alarm, till I cleared the house—I take notice of these characters—these three, and several others belonging to the gang—I do not keep a house for the reception of improper characters—I want to get rid of them as fast as I can—I am doing all I can towards it—I did not see the policeman struck—I saw Popham attempting to force his way into the door, and Watmough would not let him—I saw them struggling together—M'Phane had on a sort of blue trowsers, and a black or blue waistcoat, I think—there were a great many persons present at the time I saw the struggling—I was not outside the door, but I could see a great many persons standing outside the house.





WILLIAM JONES
. I am a policeman. I was called on on the night of the 17th of May, and rendered my resistance to Watmough—he was bleeding from the head very profusely, and when I first saw him he was just rising from the ground—I afterwards accompanied him into the beer-shop to take Donoghue—after putting him into the station. Murphy accompanied Watmough elsewhere, and M'Phane was afterwards brought to the station—I am well acquainted with the prisoners' persons.





PATRICK MURPHY
 (police-constable L 24.) I went with Watmough, from the station, to take M'Phane into custody—I observed a light in the room before we entered, it was put out as we approached the door—we went in, took him out of bed, and brought him away—I was not acquainted with the prisoners' persons before this.





MARK WAGSTAFF
. I am surgeon to the L division of police, and live in Walcot-place, Lambeth. On the 17th of May, Watmough came to me about half-past one o'clock in the middle of the night—I observed a good deal of blood about his head, a cut on the left-side, and the head and face altogether a good deal bruised—he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood—his cheek was slightly cut—from the appearance he presented, he had decidedly been much beaten—the cut on the head was very near the temple—I consider it a dangerous spot for a man to receive a blow—I think it a blow very likely to have been inflicted with the life-preserver produced—it was not a sharp cut—I anticipated concussion of the brain—I kept him off duty for five days, and he was seven days only on reserve duty—the reserve duty does not come under my direction—if the blow had been on the temple, it would have been very likely to have deprived him of life.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. That is to say if it had been struck somewhere else, it would have been very dangerous? A. Yes, it is not always the wound that produces the danger, but the consequence of the blow on the brain—I consider that the same effect on the brain might be produced by the blow taking place where it did, as if it took place on the temple—the blow may be given in one part, and the mischief in the brain may be in another part—you do not have mischief in the brain immediately after the blow—it was the parietal bone that was struck, just over the

left temple—concussion of the brain does not follow immediately on the blow—sometimes it is a day or two after, and sometimes a fortnight—the symptoms, I mean—the concussion takes place at the time, but the consequences may not be apparent for a fortnight—there was no concussion in this case—there was nothing to induce me to believe there was concussion—the man was very much bruised.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHARNOCK. Q. How long was he under your care? A. Five days—I kept him quiet, and gave him saline draughts—I do not consider there was concussion here—such a blow would be likely to produce it—concussion must of course take place at the time the blow is given—I have known concussion of the brain produced by a blow in the position I have described—I recollect several persons being brought in while I was at the hospital, where concussion had been produced by such a blow as this, not from a life-preserver.
(Witnesses for M'Phane.)





MARGARET COONEY
. I am the wife of Thomas Cooney, a cooper in Short-street, Tower-street—M'Phane lodged with me for nine months. On the night of the 17th of May, he came home in his usual manner, about eleven o'clock, or a little after, I cannot say to a minute or two—I that was generally his usual time—he was dressed in blue trowsers, and a frock-coat, blue, I think, but I cannot be positive, although I have seen it repeatedly—it was the one he has always been in the habit of wearing at my place—when he came home he retired to his room—he was perfectly sober when he came in—I heard no more of him till a quarter to twelve, when I heard a great noise going by my door—I opened the door, and saw my brother Matthew Allen in custody with Watmough and several more of the police, and they were beating him very cruelly—I cried and made a great alarm, and went to the stairs, and cried out, M'Phane came down immediately and hallooed out, "What is the matter, is there a fire?"—I said, "No, but my brother is gone by with the police; oh dear, what has be done?"—I called M'Phane down by name, as my husband was not in-doors at the time—he came down in his trowsers and stockings, and no shoes, and went out as far as a ditch at the corner of my place—he met with a person, and said, "What has Matthew Allen done?"—he said, "He is taken into custody for beating the police"—he returned and told me and said, "Never mind, don't fret, it will only be a fine in the morning"—he then returned to his room, and I heard no more of him till a quarter to one, as near as can be—several of the police then came to my door, and knocked at my shutters—I and my husband were in bed—my door was fastened—I asked what they wanted—they said, "Open the door, or else we will have it open"—I wished them to tell what they wanted—I heard them say, "Bring the crowbars, open the door, or we will have it open immediately"—I said, "Don't burst open my door, I will open it, who is it you want?"—they said, "Make haste"—I got up and opened it, and the police all rushed in with their staves drawn—I saw a person named Chapman outside the door—he is always in company with the police—I heard Chapman say, "He lives in the second floor front room—go straight up, and I dare say he is at home now, for I saw him some time ago at the corner of the ditch"—a great many policemen went up into the room, and Chapman and a policeman staid down at the door—I was too flurried to count how many went up stairs—I heard M'Phane say he was in

bed—the policeman said, "Come, get up"—he said, "What for, what have I done?"—they said they would soon let him know when they got him to the station—I heard every word that passed, except what was said in the room—I could not hear that—M'Phane never said, "I shall be nailed for this, but I shall be only fined 5l., or if it is 10l. I can pay it"—I am confident he never made use of any such words, or any thing like it—he only kept saying, what had he done, or what was he taken for—they then took him away.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many persons lodge in your house? A. There are four families—there are no women—I heard Watmough say when he went out just now to speak to the solicitor, that I kept a house of illfame—I have six rooms—I live in the parlour—that is my sleeping room as well—my husband came home about half-past eleven o'clock that night—I cannot say to twenty minutes—he came home before M'Phane was taken, and before he went to bed—not before first let M'Phane in, when I gave him the lucifer and candle—I swear that—a shoemaker and his two children live in the first floor—M'Phane and his wife live in the second floor—he came to me as a married man—I cannot be answerable for it—I cannot tell how he has got his living—his grandfather is a hatter, in Gloucester-street, and he has worked for him—I went there as a reference—he keeps a hatter's shop there—I do nothing for my living—my husband keeps me—he is in the employ of Noble and Rolls, varnish manufacturers, and has worked for them nine years—M'Phane first came home about eleven o'clock or a little after—I have a clock hanging up in my room, so I of course could notice the time—know by the time he came in, and the time I had my supper it could not be more than eleven, or a little after—it was a quarter to eleven when I sat down to have my supper—my clock is always going—I wind it up night and morning—I am confident it was right, because my husband comes home regularly to his meals, and I am obliged to have it hit—he comes home to breakfast at half-past eight, to dinner at one, and to tea about seven, and then he does not go any more to work—I do not know where he had been that night—I did not ask him—I did not look at the clock when M'Phane came in—I did about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—it was then half-past eleven—I did not go before the Magistrate—I intended to have gone—several of the persons went to speak on my brother's behalf, and I was going to speak for him and M'Thane, but was too late, the case was heard—my brother lives at No. 24, Cheston-street, Cheston-square, very near me—he is not here, nor is my husband—I know the Farm House beer-shop—I have been there for years—I was not there that night—I was there in the morning—I left about six in the evening—I went there I dare say about five, or a little after five, after my brother and sister who were there—it was a little after eleven when M'Phane first came in, and a quarter to twelve when I called him up—the police came about a quarter to one, as near as can be—I stood at the door when he went to the corner of the ditch—the ditch is not five steps from my door—I stood at the door with the door in my hand till he came in—when my brother went by in custody I made a great alarm—I did not particularly call M'Phane—he came running down, hearing my noise, and asked what was the matter—any other of the lodgers might just as well have come down as him—they might well be alarmed, for the police beat my brother so cruelly—the shoemaker on the first floor looked out of the window—no

one else came down but M'Phane—ray brother did not bleed at all—he complained of his chest, where they beat him, and they rushed him against the posts at my door, and Watmough stated that he was positive my brother was the man that struck him—I heard him say so down at the hall—he said to me, "What have you come down here for?"—I said, "I have come down to see about my brother"—he said "Your brother won't be hurt—I shall not hurt your brother"—I was summoned here by that gentleman (the prisoner's attorney) I have seen Popham before, not at my house—I have seen him at my door—he has not been in my room, nor in my house, only at the door—I am quite sure of that—I cannot tell whether he was an acquaintance of M'Phane—he must have been—it was not after me or any one belonging to me that he came—when Popham has been to my door it was after M'Phane he has come—I cannot tell how often he has been there—not three or four times a week—I have not seen him twenty times, nor half twenty—I will not say how many times, but I know he has not been twenty times—I know Donoghue perfectly well in the neighbourhood—he knows M'Phane by sight, but as to being any companion of his or not, that I cannot swear—I nave known Donoghue from his birth pretty well, and I know M'Phane never associates with him—I am confident of that—I do not know M'Phane's associates, but I know Donoghue is not an associate of his—my brother went to school with Donoghue, and when they come home from work they are generally together—I believe Donoghue has been in custody for felony—I have no doubt about it—I know it perfectly Well—he was brought up a very good steady boy—he ought to have been so—my brother works hard for his living—he has never been in trouble, nor any of our family—I never knew M'Phane before he took my lodging—his wife came after the room—I cannot say how soon it was after M'Phane came that I saw Popham—he was a long time there before I saw Popham—I have not known Popham—he is an entire stranger to me except seeing him at my door—I never saw him at my door before M'Phane came there, nor any where else—I should not have known him from Adam, and I am sure I do not know him.

MR. CHARNOCK. Q. You have no interest in the question? A. Not at all—my husband works hard for Ms living, and all my family—I live by his industry—mine is a respectable house—there is no ground for saying it is a bad house—I believe M'Phane to be married—they always conducted themselves very properly while with me—the shoemaker is married, and has two children—the person in the back room is a widow—my clock is a Dutch one, I do not intentionally keep it wrong—I keep it right, to be prepared for my husband's meals—as far as I know, it was correct at that time—I can be on my oath that it was.

JURY. Q. At the time you let M'Phane in, had you a candle alight in the parlour? A. Yes—when he came in I gave him a short bit of candle—the wick was rather damp—I attempted to light it, but said, "Here is a couple of lucifers, you can manage to light it yourself"—I put out my candle when my husband and I went to bed—I cannot tell what time that was, I was so worreted at my brother being taken—I dare say I was in bed about half an hour before the police came—it was precisely a quarter to one o'clock when they came to the door—Mthane came down, in consequence of my making the noise—I did not exactly call him by name—my husband was in the house then, but he is a very timid man, and had been ill previously, and when he heard the noise of the police at the door, he trembled and shook like a leaf.






WILLIAM COTTERELL
. I am an equestrian performer, and live in Hooper-street, next door to the Farm-house beer-shop. On the 17th of May I heard a disturbance there, and went to my door, to sec what it was—the row was inside—Watmough came up, and stood alongside of me—I did not say thing to him or he to me—I only stood by him—I saw a man with no hat on, and Watmough laid hold of him, pulled him out of the door, and told him to go about his business—he had just stepped in at the door—that man was dressed in a corduroy suit, but I cannot say I could swear to him, being in the dark—he burst away from Watmough, and got into the house again—Watmough followed him, dragged him, and pulled him out, and then a scrummage took place between the pair of them—they both clung together—this was somewhere about half-past eleven o'clock, as near as I can say—I did not see what the parties did to each other—I did not interfere in it, because I am a cripple, and an invalid—I did not go in and shut the door—I saw the finish of it—Watmough fell down—I saw him rise up, with some blood running down his face—I saw no blow—Wat-mough cried out that he had struck him with something—there were many neighbours and persons present besides me, but no one interfered with the policeman, except that one man—he knocked the policeman down some-how or other—they rolled over one another, and the man got up and ran away from him—I am quite certain the man was dressed in a corduroy suit, rather dark—I do not know M'Phane at all—I never saw either of the prisoners before—M'Phane was not there nor Donoghue—none of them were there—only one person interfered with the policeman during the whole of the time—I picked up the policeman's hat and held it for him—since this the policemen have called me up, I stated what I had seen, and they then said they did not want me—I have not been subpœnaed by the police, I have by the other parties.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep any horses? A. No—I do not go to fairs—I am with Mr. Ducrow, and so forth—I am not in any engagement at present, but my father is, and I live with him—he has an engagement with Mr. Ducrow as an equestrian—I swear he is a performer, and so am I—I have performed with many companies—I have been with Batty's-circus, but am now a cripple, from the rheumatism—Watmough called out, "Cotterell, assist me"—I did not immediately run in and shut my door—I was there all the time—I stood in the crowd, but did not interfere at all, I was not able—it is twelve months since I rode on horse-back—I was performing abroad six months ago on the slackrope—I do not know Mr. M'Phane at all, only from seeing him pass up and down the street two or three times—I did not speak to him—I have lived on my friends for the last six months, not being able to do any thing—know nothing of the prisoners—when Watmough called to me I went to his assistance, as far as I could—I picked up his hat, and held it for him.

MR. CHARNOCK. Q. There were a great many persons there? A. Yes—if any one has said there was nobody present, that would not be correct—about six months ago I broke a blood-vessel, and that brought me home.





WILLIAM HERRING
. lam a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 32, Hooper-street. On the night of the 17th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was up at my window, and saw Watmough coming down Hooper-street, towards my house, talking to three young girls—I told him he would soon be wanted, there being a disturbance at the Farm-house—Watmough replied

that he was going down to the Farm-house—I saw him go, and followed him—he did not go into the Farm-house, he stood at the door, till the party ran out in the attitude of fighting—the party then waited in the road, and wished to go in again—Watmough pushed them from the door—I was standing with Watmough, watching the parties—the party that ran out rushed right by Watmough, and went into the house again—Watmough went in after him, seized him, and pulled him out—they scuffled across the road, till they got to one of the small houses—Watmough then struck him with his rattle—T did not exactly know that person, I never saw him before that night—it was neither of the prisoners—the man was dressed in corduroy, or fustian, I do not know which—it was not M'Phane—he was not there—a scuffle ensued, and the man that was struck with the rattle, I believe, knocked off the policeman's hat, as near as I can recollect—they scuffled a few minutes—I was behind Watmough at the time—he called on me—they fell, and I saw the man hitting the policeman with something in his hand—I do not know M'Phane, more than passing up and down the street, I have no intimacy with him—he was not at the spot at all, neither did he strike the policeman; for the party that did so was a great deal taller—there was only one person scuffling—was applied to by Wat-mough to give evidence on the part of the prosecution—I told him the evidence I could give—he said, "I have got the right two, have I not?" I said, "No, you have not"—I said I should speak the truth when I went up to Horsemonger-lane, where he told me I was to go—he told me to prepare myself for Monday—he has not subpœnaed me—he threatened me at Horsemonger-lane, if I appeared here—he took me into a little room, put his finger up, and said, "You had better mind what you are about, or you will get severely punished"—I told him I could not be punished for speaking the truth—that was all he said.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who do you work for? A. For shops in general—I have manufactured ever since I have been out of my time—I have a small house—I cannot say whether Popham is the man Watmough had the scuffle with, I should not like to say—the man was much taller than M'Phane—Popham is a little taller than M'Phane—I have lived in Hooper-street two years—I do not know Mrs. Cooney, except since she has been with me to Horsemonger-lane—I was never at her house, no more than I might see the prisoner's attorney there—I cannot tell what day that was—it was the time the trial was to have been on at Horsemonger-lane—I should say it was a month or six weeks ago—I cannot call to mind the date—I was never there before, I swear that—I have been since—I was there this morning—Mrs. Cooney came down for me—I know Mrs. Yellady by being a neighbour—I was never in her house—she lives right opposite Cotterell—I saw her last yesterday afternoon—she was talking to my wife at our door when I went home—I believe her husband had been illusing her—I went to the Farm-house beer-shop that night—after the policemen were there, not before—there was a disturbance at a club there—I heard a little bit of a riot, and went down, similar to my neighbours—I did not know what it was about—they seemed all fighting together, friends and foes—I have never been in any trouble.

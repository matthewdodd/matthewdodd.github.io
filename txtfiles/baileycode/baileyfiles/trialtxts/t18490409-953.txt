On 25th Feb. the prisoner came for a bed; he desired to have a clean one—he hid one for a shilling—I went up into the room with him—he came down about nine o'clock in the morning, and said, "I shall want the bed again to-night—he went out, and my wife went up into the room, and the articles stated

were all missing—no one else had been there who could have taken them—they were all safe the night before.

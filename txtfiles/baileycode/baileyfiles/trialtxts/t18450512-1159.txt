GEORGE WRIGHT
. I live in Boulevard-court, Strand, and am in the employ of Mr. John Collins. On the 7th of May, about nine o'clock at night, I was near Hyde Park, in Knightsbridge. I had a pair of boots of my master's—I was asking a respectable young woman my way to Chelsea—the prisoners came up to me, and said they would show me—they walked me about for two hours, till they got to the Willow-walk, and then George Mortimer held me while Richard took the boots from me, and ran away—I then asked George Mortimer to show me the way home, and we had only just turned out of the fields when we met a policeman, and I gave him in charge—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I am ten years old—these are the boots.





JOHN FRYER
 (police-constable P 31.) Wright gave me George Mortimer in charge—he said, George did not take die boots from him, but one that was with him did, and George said it was his brother—I took Wright with me, and went to a house—I found Richard Mortimer sitting on the bed in the back kitchen, and these boots were under the bed where he sat.
(George Mortimer received a good character.)

 G. MORTIMER—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—



Confined Three Months.

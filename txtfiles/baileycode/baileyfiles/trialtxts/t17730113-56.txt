            's, in Peter-street, Cow-cross. I suspected Low, my servant, an errand boy, about eighteen years old, of having stole them; my reason for supposing it was, because nobody had access there but he and me; I looked in a box of which nobody had the key but this boy to fetch things as might be wanted; I had no other servant but a servant girl; I never employed her to go into this warehouse. I found these things at the house of Smith, in Cow-cross: Smith behaved very well and let us take the things; Low confessed before the Justice that he did steal them.

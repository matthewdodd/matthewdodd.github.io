            . I am a relation of Mrs.

            's property, from the pegs, and put them on his shoulder and go out of my shop. I pursued and took hold of him, and said, Where are you going with this harness? He dropped them and ran away. I pursued, and before he got through Deans-Yard, he was taken and brought back. I carried him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and he was committed.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming by, and saw this harness lying in the street. I picked them up, and the Gentleman came to me, and asked me where I got them? I said, I picked them up. I was a stranger in the place, and was enquiring where I could get a place for service.

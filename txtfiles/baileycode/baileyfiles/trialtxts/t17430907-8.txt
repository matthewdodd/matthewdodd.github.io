William Hill. The Prisoner was my Servant, and worked for me as a Porter
 weekly. I suspected that the Prisoner was not honest, so I put 14 s. and two Sixpences into the Till on Purpose to catch him, and concealed myself in the back Part of the Shop, with another with me, and between eight and nine in the Evening, I saw him unlock the Till, and take some Money out, and lock it again; there were two Shillings taken out of the Till. Said I to the Person that was with me, I think we have seen enough. The Prisoner seeing me come out of the back Part of the House, took to his Heels, and ran away.

            . I marked the Money that was put into the Till, (14 s. and two Sixpences) but a Quarter of an Hour before it was taken out; I saw the Prisoner take out the Drawer, and take some out, and saw it taken out of his Pocket afterwards. This is the same Money.

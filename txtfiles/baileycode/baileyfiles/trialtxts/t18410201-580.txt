FREDERICK HUDSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of January, 21 pairs of gloves, value 15s., the goods of 



William Berwick Brown; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CALEB GROVE
 (City police-constable, No. 522.) About eight o'clock in the evening of the 19th of January, I saw the prisoner standing by the prosecutor's window, in the Minories, and almost at the same moment he shoved the window and took something out—he broke the glass—he ran away—I ran after him—he turned down Vine-street, and a passerby stopped him—I took him back to the shop—I saw him throw away what he had—I sent a person to the place, and he returned with these gloves.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Are you sure the prisoner threw it away? A. Yes—I was about the length of this Court from him—there was not a person in the street except the man who stopped him—I did not lose sight of him—I swear positively the prisoner is the person who threw it away.





THOMAS BROWN
. I am brother to William Berwick Brown, who keeps the shop. I was at home—I heard a crash at the window—I went out, and went round the corner—I did not see any one—I went back, and then returned, and met the policeman with the prisoner—the policeman told me the place, and I went and found these twenty-one pairs of gloves—they are my brother's property—they had been in the window, and the glass was broken.





JOHN PICKARD
 (City police-constable, No. 550.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office— (read)—Iwas present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

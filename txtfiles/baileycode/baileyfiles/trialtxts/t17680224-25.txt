            , he is a waterman
 and lighterman
; on the 26th of January, about nine at night, I lost a surtout coat, a close bodied coat, a scarlet waistcoat, and a silk handkerchief, out of the vessel at Wapping


; the prisoner was taken on the 28th with my silk handkerchief about his neck, at Deptford, some of the rest were found at his lodgings; there he confessed before the Justice at Greenwich, that he was in liquor coming from the Tower, and knowing the vessel he went on board her, and took an opportunity, as no body was on board, to take the things; he confessed to the taking all the things mentioned in the indictment; he had sold my surtout coat, and pawned the close bodied one; my master's things as well as mine were found by the direction of the prisoner; I have known him seven years, but never to be guilty of such a thing before.

            . The vessel lay near my back door in the county of Middlesex; I have known the prisoner seven or eight years, he always behaved well for whatever I know.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.



               Guilty

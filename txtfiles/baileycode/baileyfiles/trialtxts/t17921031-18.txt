I am a hardwareman
; I live in Fleet-market


; on Saturday the 13th of October I lost four gilt watch chains, I was informed that my glass-case was robbed, I ran out, and found the show-glass robbed; I pursued the prisoner, and brought him back and searched him; a neighbour said search his hair (I had forgot Barrington's scheme), and I took his hat off, and the chains dropped down from his hair.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I bought them of a school-fellow that I was playing with; I am not 12 years old.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the London Jury, before Lord KENYON.
Has the prisoner been here before?

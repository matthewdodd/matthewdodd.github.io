JOHN WITHERS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of April, 3 1/2 yards of satin, value 33s., the property of 



John Whitton and another.






JOHN WHITTON
. I am a woollen-draper in Tottenham Court-road. I have a partner—the prisoner was at work in my shop as a journeyman painter—on the 13th of April I missed a piece of satin, and found it in pledge—I went to the prisoner's lodging, and took him in bed.





HENRY KILSBY
. I am shopman to Mr. Wad more, of Tottenham Court-road. On the 13th of April, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner pawned this satin for 5s., in the name of John Gurney, Tottenham-place—I would have lent him 1l. on it.
The prisoner pleaded poverty; and George Gillingham, of Southampton-court, Tottenham-court-road, and—Knight, a lock-smith, gave him a good character.




GUILTY
.* Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

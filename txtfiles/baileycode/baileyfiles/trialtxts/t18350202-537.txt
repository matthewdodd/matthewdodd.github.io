SAMUEL FURLER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of January, 2 sheets, value 7s.; and 2 handkerchiefs, value 1s. 6d.; the goods of 



Robert Ashby; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARY ASHBY
. I am the wife of Robert Ashby, a police-constable, who lives in Homer-row, Marylebone. The prisoner came to the house for a lodging—I said I had not one ready, but I would get him one the next day—he pressed me very much to let him have one that night; and as I knew his father and mother twelve years ago, and knew him from living

with them, I did so—he came in about nine o'clock—I went into the room with him—he was to pay half-a-crown a week—the next morning I called him, and told him I was very sorry to hear such a bad account of him; that I heard he had been committed to prison a great many times—he said, "Who could tell you that?"—I said, "If you have, I hope you now see the error of your conduct, and will do better," and if he was a good lad he might continue in my lodging—he then went out—I went up stairs, and missed the sheets and handkerchief, and many other things which I could not specify—no one but him had access to them.





SAMUEL DILLON
 (police-constable D 145.)) I took the prisoner—I produce the certificate of his former conviction (read)—I know he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

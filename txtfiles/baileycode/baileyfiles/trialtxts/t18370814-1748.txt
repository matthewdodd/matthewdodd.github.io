ROBERT REYNOLDS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of July, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Timothy Maber, from his person.






TIMOTHY MABER
. I was passing through Bridge-street, Blackfriars, on the evening of the 21st of July—I felt a twitch, and turned and saw the prisoner fall to the ground—I took the handkerchief with one hand and seized him with the other—this is my handkerchief—there was no one near to pick my pocket but him—I saw it in his hand before he fell down.





THOMAS FRANCIS BROWN
. I am the officer. I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief now.

Prisoner's Defence, I saw two boys about the prosecutor—one did pick his pocket, I passed between, a lady and gentleman, and he turned and took hold of me.





TIMOTHY MABER

re-examined. It was a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening—there were no two boys there that I saw—the prisoner fell down like a setter-dog before a bird.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

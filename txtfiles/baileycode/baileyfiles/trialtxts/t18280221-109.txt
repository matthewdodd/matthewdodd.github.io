            . I am the wife of Thomas Cranstoun; he lives at the corner of Wilson-street, Finsbury


. On the 18th of January, near ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came alone to our shop, and asked the price of two handkerchiefs which were laying in the window - I said 2s. 6d. each; he asked if I would keep them till the next night; which would be Saturday - I said I did not know but we might; he went away, and I asked a person who was there to look to the shop while I went up stairs - before I got to the top, she called, and said a boy had opened the shop door, and taken a shawl off the line in the window - I ran out and saw the watchman at the door - my husbandcame up with the prisoner and the shawl - I am certain he is the same boy who had been in the shop before; this shawl is my husband's.
THOMAS CRANSTOUN. I was returning home on the evening of Friday, the 18th of January, and as I came near my shop, which is at the corner, and well lighted, I saw the prisoner and two other boys about my window; the prisoner seemed to have something that he was doubling up - I am not certain whether he received it from any of the other boys; but I seized him and another; the other got away - I secured the prisoner with this shawl, which I am certain is mine - it has my ticket on it.

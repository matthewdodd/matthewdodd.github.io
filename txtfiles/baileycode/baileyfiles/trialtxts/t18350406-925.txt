THOMAS JOHNSON,



 TIMOTHY GRADY
, and 



JOHN ROBERTS
, were indicted for

stealing, on the 
18th of March, 1 handkerchief; value 2s.; the goods of 



Waring Biddle, from his person.






WILLIAM POWELL
. I live in Charlton-street, Westminster-rotd. On the 8th of March, I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars—I saw the three prisoners together, they were talking, and seemed to be acquainted—they were walking fast after Mr. Biddle, and I saw Johnson take a handkerchief from his pocket and put it into a hand, but I cannot say whose hand—they then went down a turning, which I think is Water-lane—they then came back and went towards the bridge—a young man, who was with me, went after Mr. Biddle, and I followed the prisoners over Blackfriars-bridge—I saw them all taken—the handkerchief was found on Grady—they would not know one another.

Grady. Q. Was this in Water-lane? Witness. No, in Bridge-street, and you went down Water-lane—I was on the other side of the way, but I crossed after you—I did not hear Roberts speak to the others, but the others followed a gentleman down Bankside, and I went after them.





JOHN SUTTON
 (police-constable L 92.) I took the prisoners, and found this handkerchief on Grady.





WARING BIDDLE
. I was in Bridge-street, and lost this handkerchief.

Johnson's Defence. This policeman will swear any thing—he told me he was suspended for a month.


Grady's Defence. I was going over the bridge, and happened to kick this handkerchief—I picked it up, and put it into my pocket—this policeman came and said he wanted me—I know nothing of these two prisoners—I do not think that Johnson was with me—that person was taller, and had not a hat-band on his hat.

JOHNSON—

It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner came to the 4 Swan-Inn in Bishopsgate-Street


 to lodge there, pretending to go in the Harwich Coach the Monday following, and having lain there a Night or two, made some Excuses to come into the Kitchen, first for Paper to write a Letter, and then for a Waser to seal it, so took an Opportunity to steal the Mug, and go away with it, but was stopp'd in offering it to Sale. The Fact being fully prov'd upon her, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 39 s.

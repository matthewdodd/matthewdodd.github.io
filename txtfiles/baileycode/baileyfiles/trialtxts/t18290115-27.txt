            . I am a broker
, and live in Marshall-street, Golden-square


. On the 18th of December, about a quarter before five o'clock, I was standing in my parlour, and saw an arm take something from the door - I ran across the shop, and missed a painting; I looked to the left, and saw the prisoner and no other person - he ran, and I pursued him, and took him in John-street, Golden-quare; I accused him of stealing my painting - he said he had not, and asked me if I had got it; I said, No; he said if I would forgive him he would tell me where it was - I said I would not; I took him back, and he said he would tell me, that it was in the private door of the next house - I went there, found it, and sent for an officer.

             VALENTINE. I received the prisoner and this painting; he said he had taken it by the advice of a person whom he did not know where to find.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a person named Campbell, who said he had been to the shop and bought the picture; he told me to go and get it, and he would meet me in Marlborough-row - he said if I did not go he would open my head for me.

             sworn.
I was in Rosemary-lane; on the 27th, I saw the prisoner offering three very good handkerchiefs for twenty-pence, a woman bid him fourteen-pence, he looked at me, and said, will you have them? I said, what, for fourteen-pence? and he took and bull'd them at the woman, and she put them in her apron; there was another ill-looking fellow, and I followed them, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket; I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, sir, you have had your pocket picked; I seized the prisoner, and said, you rascal, you have picked that man's pocket; the prisoner had taken the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's right-hand pocket; I took him by the collar with my right-hand, and took the handkerchief with my left.

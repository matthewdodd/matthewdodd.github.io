             sworn.
I am a furrier: on the 5th of November I was called down stairs, and found fifty-two skins offering for sale by the prisoner; he had sold my servant some in the morning of this day; I asked him where he got them; he said he bred them, that he kept a large number of rabbits; I told him he dried them very nice; he said yes, he hung them up by the nose to dry in the cellar; I then told him that would not do, for that they were foreign skins; I threatened to send him to the compter; and he then said, that a man had given them to him to sell; I told him to send for the man; he said he did not know where to send for the man, as he had never seen him before: he came to me about seven o'clock in the evening.

             sworn.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Thomas; I was present when the prisoner brought in the goods; I am sure he is the man who sold me some skins the same morning.

My lord, I am a servant to Messrs. Borrodaile; these skins are of the same quality of those we lost; these are Flemish skins.
Prisoner. Please you, my lord; coming from London-wall, a man gave me these skins to sell, and said, if I sold them, he would give me a shilling; I do not know where to find him.

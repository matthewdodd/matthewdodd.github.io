            . I am a lighterman
, and live on Old Fish-street-hill


. The prisoner came to lodge at the house on the 28th of September - I lost my coat on the 30th; I apprehended him on the 6th of November, at Pimlico and told him he was the person who stole my coat- he said he did not steal it; that it was given to him by my wife to pawn, and he pawned it for 1l.; he is a jobbing man.
MARTHA BATHO. I missed my husband's coat from the room; the prisoner left the house at the same time, without notice - he was only with us two nights; I never gave him leave to pawn the coat - I left him in the room, and went into the yard, returned in a few minutes, and he was gone; I missed the coat next morning - nobody had been there but him.
Prisoner. Q. Did I not come and ask you to lend me 1l.? A. It is quite false; I said nothing about not wishing my husband to know it - it is false.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had obtained the coat from the prosecutrix through a false representation, but not feloniously.

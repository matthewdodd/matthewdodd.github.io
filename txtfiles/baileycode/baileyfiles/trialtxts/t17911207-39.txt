I am guard to the Newcastle and Litchfield waggon, and was so in September last; I remember the box in question, and should know it again, but am no scholar; as I got to the Pyed Bull, at Islington, a gentlewoman informed me my waggon was robbed, and I missed the box.

             sworn.
On the 1st of November, between three and four, the field next to where I live, the two prisoners were in there, and laid themselves flat on the bank; and the prisoner Banks, I saw him go down the bank, behind the waggon, into the road; the other man is not the other prisoner, but he went over the stile; I thought they were waiting for passengers in the waggon; I looked at him, and he looked at me; I saw him jump up and untie the string, and then get into the waggon; when he got out, he had nothing; he walked on a few yards, and took out a deal box, and some little parcel which dropped; he went down Chapel-street; I informed the waggoner; I should know the box as it appears, but I did not read the direction.

I am a labouring man; I lodge at the Pyed Bull; I remember the robbery, and pursued up Chapel-street; I saw three men going across the field, and one had this box on his right shoulder; I got into the same field; I was alone; I called to Mr. Saddington, the landlord, to follow; and they hearing me call, the man who had the box threw it down, and they all ran away; I know the prisoners are two of the men, but which had the box I do not know; the box was delivered by me to Mr. Kaye.

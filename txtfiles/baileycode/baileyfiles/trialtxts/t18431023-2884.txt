ELIZABETH CHESTER
. I am the wife of John Chester, of Dalziel-place, a plumber. On the 19th of Oct., about ten o'clock, I fastened up the wash-house, and left these things safe—about three o'clock in the morning I was called up by the police, and found the washhouse in great confusion, and the property removed, and placed in different places to where I had left it the night before—the window had been opened by removing the fastenings—I am sure it was fastened at night.





THOMAS EATON
 (policeman.) About two o'clock in the morning I was on duty, and saw the prisoner go to the washhouse, try the door, and then go to the window—a square of glass was out, he put his hand in, removed several things which were placed against the window, at last I stepped forward to the window and opened it, having seen him go in—I did not see him remove the linen—I found it just inside the window—on the prosecutrix being called up she said it had been removed—I took him into custody.

Prisoner. The linen was taken out of a tub, and put into a basket, after I was taken. Witness. I did not remove it till after the prosecutrix came down.





TIMOTHY WELLS
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person who was tried and convicted.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

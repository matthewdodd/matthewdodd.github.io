JAMES JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of December, 4 half-crowns, the monies of 



Patience Putman.






PATIENCE PUTMAN
. I am in the service of Mr. Blower, in Henrietta-street. The prisoner occasionally came to clean knives—he came at ten minutes before eight o'clock on the morning of the 27th of December, and went for some water—he did not return as usual—I had left four half-crowns on the dresser-shelf the night before, about ten o'clock—no one had been there between that time and his coming—there is another servant—I missed my money about half-past eight—no one had an opportunity of taking it but him.





JONATHAN WHICHER
 (police-constable E 47.) I took the prisoner to the station—he said he was very sorry for taking the money—he hoped she would forgive him.





ANN HOPKINS
. I am servant at Mr. Blower. I saw the money safe—I did not take it—there was no one but the prisoner could have taken it.

Prisoner's Defence. I took my pitcher for water and broke it—I was afraid to go back again—the officer took me—I said I was very sorry—I did not take the half-crowns—I never saw them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

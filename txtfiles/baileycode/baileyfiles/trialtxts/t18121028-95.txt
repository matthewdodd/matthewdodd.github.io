            . On the 29th of September I had in my barn ten sacks and three bushels of wheat, called Chatham wheat. It growed upon black ground. We had sowed on that ground, three years before, French wheat.
Q. Was there anything in this wheat particular - A. Yes, black ground. I saw it in my barn on the Tuesday. On the Wednesday morning I missed some of this wheat. My barn was broken open. I took a sample of the same wheat to Staines, on Friday, the 2nd of October. Mr. Saunders was there; he shewed me the wheat. I saw the wheat, and inspected it. I had no doubt it was mine. This is the sample of my wheat, that I missed.
Q. Was any French wheat grown in your neighbourhood - A. No, none.

            . I am a meal-man. I reside at Staines. On the 2d of October I saw the prisoner at Staines market. He standing by a sack of wheat, that was for sale in the market. I asked him the price. He asked sixty-five shillings. I bid him fifty-five. He at last took it. He said, he had been standing there all the morning. He lived at Colnbrook, and he grew the wheat at Colnbrook. He wished to have the sack shot immediately. He wanted to get home to dinner. I took the wheat home. I am sure it is the same wheat. This is a sample of the wheat I bought. That has been in my possession ever since.

            . I am brother-in-law to the prisoner. On Wednesday morning he came into my little room. He brought something in a sack. He put it down. Me and my wife were a bed. He said, he had some gleaned wheat; he was going to take it to market. On Thursday the prisoner took it away. He said, he was going to Staines market, to sell it, to pay his rent. My wife went to Staines, on Friday morning, along with him.

 ANN GIBSON. This sack of wheat was brought just as my husband has related. I went with the prisoner to Staines. He asked the sack carrier to fetch it on the ass.

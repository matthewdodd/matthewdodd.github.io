 - the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to my house on the 10th of October, and asked for a bed to carry to Mr. Scott's, in Duke-street; my husband works there, and I thought it was for my husband - I gave the bed to the prisoner; when my husband returned, I found he had not sent him - I found the bed at the pawnbroker's.

            . I am the husband of this witness - I was removing at the time; but I did not send the prisoner for the bed - I went to the pawnbrokers and redeemed the bed.

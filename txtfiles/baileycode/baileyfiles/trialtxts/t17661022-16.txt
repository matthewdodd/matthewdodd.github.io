            , we live in Piccadilly


; the prisoner came to me and desired to have a lodging, and after some difficulty I let her have a room at half a crown a week; I missed a sheet from her bed the very day she went away, which is six weeks ago last Monday.
Q. How long did she lodge with you?
M. Brandel. She lodged with me but one week.
Q. Did you know of her going away?

M. Brandel. No, I did not; I missed the bed-curtains out of a trunk in a two pair of stairs room; she had told me she had lived at Justice Girdler's; I went there to know if that was true; there I was told she had robbed them also; the Justice granted me a warrant without any expence. I took her up, and by her confession I found out where the things were sold.

            . On the 13th of last month the prisoner brought me two bed curtains to sell.
Q. What are you?
A. Joland. I keep a sale-shop in White-lion-street; the prisoner brought the things mentioned to me at two separate times, and I bought them of her.
Prisoner's defence.
I am an utter stranger in town, and was out of necessaries, or I had not done it.

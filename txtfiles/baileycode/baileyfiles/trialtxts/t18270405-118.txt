JOHN CLAY. I am a stable-keeper
 at Kingsland


. On the 14th of March I received information. I had seen my pail safe about five minutes before; I came to the top of the street, and saw the prisoner with it on her arm; she was walking, and turned into Union-street - she went nearly to the bottom, when Hunter took hold of her. I came up, she had the pail on her arm; I said, "My good woman that is my pail;" she said, "If it is, take it;" I said she had better come back with me, which she did.

            . I met the prisoner with the pail - I came on to the place, and said I had met a woman with a pail. I then pursued, and took her - she came back, and was taken by the officer.

            . I am a merchant
, and live at Kennington. On the 14th of August, about twelve o'clock at noon, I was in Thames-street


; a person called out that the prisoner had taken my handkerchief from my pocket - I was opposite Lawrence Pountney-lane; I turned back, looked up the lane, and saw the prisoner in custody of Andrews, who brought him to me, and I took my handkerchief out of his breast myself; I am certain he is the man - he said it was his first offence, and that he had had no bread for three days.

            . I am an officer of Dowgate ward. I saw the prisoner alone at the corner of Lawrence Pountney-lane, in custody - I know nothing of the transaction.

            . I manage my mother's business - she keeps town-carts in Thames-street. I was going up Lawrence Pountney-lane, and heard a person call after Mr. Man that his pocket was picked; I then turned round, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the way; I laid hold of him, and held him till Mr. Man came, and I saw him take the handkerchief from his breast.(Property produced and sworn to.)

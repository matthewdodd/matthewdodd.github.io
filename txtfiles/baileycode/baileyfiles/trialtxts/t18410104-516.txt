. I live at Battle Bridge. The prisoner is my brother—I left him on the 4th of January in my work-shop, and told him not to leave on any account—I returned in about an hour, and the prisoner was gone—I saw no more of him till four o'clock—I had missed a pair of boots, and asked him where they were—he said they were down stairs—he went to look for them—he then said he had sold them for 8d., in Westbourn-street, Somers-town—I went there, and found them—these are mine—(looking at them—they are worth 5s.

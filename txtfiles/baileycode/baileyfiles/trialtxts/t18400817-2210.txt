Thomas Wright Leggett, from his person.






THOMAS WRIGHT LEGGETT
. I am a gentleman's servant. I was at Camberwell-fair, on the 18th of August, about half-past three o'clock—I had a handkerchief with me—I did not feel it taken, but the policeman spoke to me—I then saw the two prisoners close to me, and one of the officers had my handkerchief.





JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (police-constable F 39.) I was at the fair in plain clothes—I saw Last feel the prosecutor's pocket several times, then Mills came up—the prisoners nudged each other—they went close to the prosecutor, and looked down at his coat—then Mills took the handkerchief out in a small compass, and put it to his own face—I took him with it.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I was there in plain clothes—I saw Last try the prosecutor's pocket several times—Mills then came and spoke to him—Mills took the handkerchief while Last held the pocket up—I did not see the handkerchief hanging out of the prosecutor's pocket.


Mills's Defence. It was hanging half-way out of his pocket, I took, hold of it, and was going to give it him; I did not see this other boy at all.

MILLS—


GUILTY
. Aged 20.

LAST*—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.




Transported for Ten Years.

            . I am a paper-stainer
. One of my paper-hangers came last Thursday, and told me, he was coming through Rosemary-lane, and saw several pieces of paper of my make, which he suspected to be stolen. I went. They were at

            's. I can swear to 30 pieces of them. I charged the prisoner with taking them out of my shop. He confessed he did take 38 pieces; that he sold some to Mrs. Scully; that the last six pieces he sold for 7 s. 6 d. which were worth 18 s. I found 30 pieces. He told me he had one piece at his lodgings, where I found it. I had not the least suspicion of him before. (Produced in court and deposed to.)

            . I live at the bottom of the Minories, in Rosemary-lane. I bought this paper of the prisoner at the bar. I had known him five or six years: and that he did carry business on for himself. I apprehended him to be a very honest man.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

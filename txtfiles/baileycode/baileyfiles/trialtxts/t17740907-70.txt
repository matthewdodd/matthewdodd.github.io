            . On the 14th of August, going up Holborn-hill


, I felt something at my pocket; I turned round and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I immediately seized him and he dropped it; the watch being set I took him to the watch-house. (The handkerchief produced in Court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner, in his defence, said, he never saw the prosecutor, nor the handkerchief, till he laid hold of him.

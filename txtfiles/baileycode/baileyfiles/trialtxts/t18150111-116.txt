            . I am a timber rafter. On the 9th of January I was at Black-wall. I went through the Folly House; and on my going through the upper gate, I saw the prisoner on the timber. As soon as he saw me, he put his bag on his shoulder, and walked off; I walked up on the timber, and missed a piece of rope; cut off. I asked the prisoner what he had got in his bag; he put his bag down, and said he had only got a few pieces of rope that he had picked up on the timber. I said, I was look as it. I opened the bag, and found the rope cut in short pieces. I then said you have cut the rope off the timber; he said, I have not shoved any of your timber knife. I took him into the Folly-house-yard, and sent Mr. Bilgdon's son for an officer. This is the rope, it is all cut in pieces.
Prosecutor. It is my rope.
Prisoner's Defence. I am a Dane, I did it through distress.

                   Percival
               



             to Bridewell to the lodge, the prisonerMonk was brought in by the officers of Bow-street, having house breaking tools about him.
Q. Did Percival and Monk speak together at the time? - I don't know that they did; I told him that I had apprehended 
               
                  Robert
                   Percival
               



             in the Mint, he said, you might have had him before for I informed you he was in the Mint, he says, I shall not swear to him; I asked him why? he said, because I had not sent him any money while he was in trouble; I told him I never did, nor never would, because it might bias the mind to say what was wrong; he informed me that Clark, one of the witnesses that was against Waine, had given him two guineas.
Q. Mr. Lucy are you quite sure that the burglary he had been speaking to you of was the burglary committed in Mr. Robinson's? - Yes.
Q. Are you equally sure that the

             tried here in December sessions? - I have no doubt at all about it. Percival is now convicted to be two years in Clerkenwell for having house breaking tools about him.
Prisoner. Did I mention Mr. Robinson's name to you? - He did frequently.
Q. When I came in from Bow-street, I had been at Bow-street all day long for a hearing, and you had just taken Percival, and you came in and told me, with that I might say something or other to you, I cannot tell, but you speak of my words when I was in liquor.

                  Robert
                   Percival
               



             was not in custody at that time.
Q. Did he describe the

                   Percival

                  Robert
                   Percival
               



             that was tried here last December Sessions? - Yes, he described him to be the 
               
                  Robert
                   Percival
               



             who broke out of Clerkenwell, and he was the person that was tried here the last December sessions. There was a woman in New Prison on a warrant, a boy came to this woman in New Prison, and Monk says to me, Blackiter (this was just before Percival was taken) follow the boy, he is going to 
               
                  Robert
                   Percival
               



            , because he had got on a coat that he had sold Percival.
Q. This conversation between you and Monk, was for the purphse of giving you information where to find Percival for this robbery? - It was; he said, that boy would go to Percival.
Q. Now you are sure that he talked whenever he talked about Percival about the 
               
                  Robert
                   Percival
               



             that was tried here last December sessions? - I am sure.
Q. And you are sure that it was the robbery of Mr. Robinson's that he spoke of? - I am; he gave me an information to go to Mr. Lucy and tell him where Waine was, and I went, and in consequence of that Waine was apprehended.
Prisoner. Did I tell you where to find Waine? - He did, he told me that Waine was at the White Hart, in Enfield Wash.
Q. When Mr. Lucy came to the Prison was there no talk about any reward between Mr. Lucy, you and I? - No, there was not.

Q. Did you never talk to me and wanted me to apply for a reward? - No, I never did.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
In the first place Mr. Blackiter that is now come to swear against me, has been an officer in every office almost round London, and discharged, through misconduct, from every office that he has been in; and now at this present time he lives with a common shoplifter.
Blackiter, I never was discharged from an office in my life.
Prisoner. The Percival that was taken and was brought to trial, was not the Percival that did the robbery; the words that they insinuated and drew from me, were words that I was not on my oath, neither was I before a Justice, they were only my words; I never kept any thing back from justice, I brought every thing to justice as far as lay in my power; there is no account from the prosecutor that that was the man, nor any further contradiction except my own words; them two, Harper and Blackiter, I was obliged to keep in with that I might not be turned in amongst the other prisoners; what I might have told them in liquor I cannot say. There are two Percivals. Clarke, who met us coming out of the house of Mr. Robinson's, says, it was that other Percival; he was the chief witness on Waine's trial, and is not brought forth; I thought they would have called him.

WILLIAM WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of January, 1 metal cock, value 2s.; and 2 feet of lead pipe, value 3s.; the goods of 



James Pearce, being fixed to a certain dwelling:—2nd COUNT, stating them to be the goods of 



John Sare; and that the prisoner had been previously convicted of felony.






JOHN SARE
. I am a shoemaker, living in Essex-street, Hoxton Old Town. On the 21st of January, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the girl next door came and told me to come and stop the water—I observed the cock and about two feet of pipe had been cut at the back of the house from the pipe that projected out of the wall—this is it—(examining it)—I know it by a mark on the side of the pipe—it belongs to Mr. James Pearce, my landlord.





MARTHA CHEEK
. I am the wife of William Cheek, a bricklayer of Hoxton. About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 20th of January I heard a noise in the passage—I called and no one answered—I ran up and caught the prisoner going out—I pushed him into the parlour, took bold of his jacket, and saw the piece of pipe in his jacket—I got a policeman and gave him into custody—this is the pipe.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going across the wall, and I got into the yard of a boy who told me to take it up-stairs for him.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-sergeant G 20.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

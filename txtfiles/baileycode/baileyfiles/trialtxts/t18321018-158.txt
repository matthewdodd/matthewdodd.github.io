            . I am a widow
, and live in Baldwin's-gardens, Holborn


. The prisoner and a man rented a furnished room in my house for six weeks; they both staid there together - I missed them one Wednesday, and on the Thursday I went to get my rent, I found the key put under the door, and missed a quilt and blanket - they have passed for husband and wife for six years in the parish; the duplicates were on the chimney-piece - they left on the 11th of September.

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker. I have a blanket, pawned on the 25th of July, and a quilt on the the 27th of August, by the prisoner - there was no one with her; these are the duplicates given for them.

             (Police-constable G 67). I took the prisoner, and asked her how she came to pawn the property; she said she knew she had pawned them, but intended to redeem them; I took the man she lived with, but he was discharged - he said she was not his wife, and the prisoner said she had another husband living, but had been living with this man, whose name is Burke, for ten years; he was then released - these two duplicates were found at the place.

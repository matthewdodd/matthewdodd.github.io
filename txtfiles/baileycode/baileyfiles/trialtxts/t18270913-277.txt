            . I am a constable. On the 31st of July, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Oxford-street; I saw the prisoners together, and watched them to the prosecutor's shop; Parrott went in, and Flynn was looking in at the window; Parrott came out with the hats - they ran off together; I pursued them to the corner of King-street; I saw Parrott give Flynn two of the hats to hold while he opened a bag; they went on; I followed, calling Stop thief! I secured Flynn; another person took Parrott in my sight; I took them to the watch-house, and took the hats to the prosecutor - I knew Flynn before.

            . I live in Regent-street, near the corner of Oxford-street; these hats are nine; I did not miss them till Bertiann brought them in.

PARROTT's Defence. I was in Oxford-street, looking for employ; a young man came and asked if I knew any thing of the hat business; and at the corner of King-street he gave me two hats to look at.

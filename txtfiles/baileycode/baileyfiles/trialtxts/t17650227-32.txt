            . I live at the ship, a public house, in Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street


: on the 19th of December, about seven in the morning, I discovered the lock of the warehouse-door to be broke.

Q. Has it any communication with your dwelling house?
Miller. No, it has not: there is a bridge cross Lamb-alley, that goes to it, which is let down in a morning, and drawn up at night. 
               
                  Josiah 
                  Yardley 
               



            , my partner, can give the best account of what goods were lost: that door was broke open again on the 31st of January, and a great coat was left in the room, in the pocket of which was a weaver's bobin, marked with Mr. Philips's name; we went and shewed Mr. Philips the bobin; there we were informed the coat was supposed to be the prisoner's coat; we got a warrant and took the prisoner up.


                  Josiah 
                  Yardley 
               



            . We have lost at different times out of the warehouse, things to the value of 30 l. there were taken away, between the 18th and 19th of December, two bedsteads, eight chairs, and other things; when the coat was found in the room the last time, I carried the bobin to Mr. Philips; he said it was his bobin: I shewed him the great coat; he said he would go to the prisoner, and see if he had his great coat on; he thought that was his coat. I told him what we had lost; he came and let us know that he had seen some chairs in the prisoner's apartment: then we got a warrant, and took him before the sitting Alderman: there he said he had bought the chairs: we found seven chairs and a bedstead in Blue Anchor Yard, Bunhill-row, in the prisoner's lodgings, our property: we found afterwards a four post bedstead that the prisoner had sold to a broker in Bunhill-row: the prisoner always denied taking the things.

                  Baker 
               



            , the officer, deposed to his searching the prisoner's lodgings, and finding seven chairs and a turn-up bedstead; and also to his finding a four post bedstead at a broker's in Bunhill row. Mr. Philips deposed to the bobin, it having I. P. upon it; and that the prisoner used to wear either that great coat, or one much like it. (Produced in court.)

            . I bought the four post bedstead of the prisoner for 9 s. I shewed it to Mr. Yardley.
Yardley. That bedstead is my partner's and my property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the bedstead found at the brokers; as to the chairs, I have witness that I bought and paid for them; the other bedstead I bought at a broker's, in Broker's Row.
For the Prisoner.

            . I live in Little Moorfields, at the Golden Hind: I am a weaver by trade: I was going along Bishopsgate-street; I tumbled in to the Admiral Vernon's Head, and had a pint of beer; there was the prisoner and a soldier-like man sitting; they were talking about chairs: I saw him turning over some money to the soldier; said the soldier, you have the beer to pay for; so said he, I have; and at going out I saw a couple of chairs standing at the door; they were white chairs; I never saw the soldier before to my knowledge.

            . I live in Moor's Alley, Norton Falgate; the prisoner brought seven or eight chairs and a bedstead into my yard, all of a sweat, about Christmas last, I cannot tell the exact time, they stood there some time, till he got his apartment clean'd out: he worked with me; I never knew any thing dishonest by him.
Richard Green. I have known him near twenty years; he is a hard-working industrious man; I never heard any ill of him before this.

            . I am the prisoner's father; I live in Moor's Alley Norton Falgate; he came to my House on the Tuesday fortnight before Christmas Day; I was to pay my Landlord's rent on Michaelmas day: my son wanted things in his house where he was going to live; I said, if you think well to bring your work and work with me till I make up my half year's rent, you may: he came that Tuesday, and staid with me till Christmas-eve; he, I, and my wife, lay in one bed that Tuesday night; he never was out of the bed a night, only Thursday night and Friday night, when we worked almost all night to get the money up; and as soon as I got the money up, I paid my landlord on Christmas-eve, and he went away, and did not come near me for two nights. I swear positively he was in the bed with me every night, but these two nights, at eleven at night, and these two nights we sat up to work.

            . I live in York-street, Spital-fields; I have lent him this coat very often. (Producing a coat a little resembling the other coat produced.

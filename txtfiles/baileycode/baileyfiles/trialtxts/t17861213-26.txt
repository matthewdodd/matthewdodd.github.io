On the 5th of October I was going on Fleet-market


, and I perceived somebody at my pocket; I turned round and caught the prisoner putting my handkerchief into his bosom; I took it from him; I believe it to be mine; a constable was coming by, and took him into custody; he said, he did it for want.

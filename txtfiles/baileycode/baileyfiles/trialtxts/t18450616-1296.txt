JAMES MARK TAYLOR
. I keep the Green Dragon, in Half Moon-street, Bishopsgate-street. Between two and three o'clock in the morning, on

the 5th of June, I heard an alarm, and went to my back premises—I missed a sheet, shirts, and other articles—the things now produced are mine.





BENJAMIN CATLIN
 (City police-Constable, No. 622.) At ten minutes before three o'clock that morning I was in Half Moon-street, and saw two parcels thrown from the back of a house—I went in, and found the prisoner throwing another parcel over—having seen him about an hour previous with three other persons I was fearful there were more than one in the place, and I barred the door of the house No. 48, which I had gone through—the prisoner ran up stairs, and tried three doors—I raised an alarm, and secured him—the house No. 48 is left open, and he could get to the back of the prosecutor's by that means—he took these things out of the copper—they were all wet when I took them.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

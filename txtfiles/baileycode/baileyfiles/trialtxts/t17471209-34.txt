 to the people that lived there before, she desir'd to lie with my maid; in the mean time she got a private key, and out of a box she took ten pounds: I put up that money to pay the brewer, but two days before, there were between twenty-seven and thirty pounds in one box, and she took ten pounds of it; f ame the 23d in the evening and said nothing to any body. Immediately I sent to Daxson the constable and charged him with her, and I found a cap and pocket upon her; afterwards she confest 4 guineas that she gave to a man in Clare-market.

            . That pocket is not mine, but the caps are mine; they were taken out of her pocket under her pillow the 23d of Oct. she said she brought them that night in order to leave them; these things were in my room which she opened by a false key.
This key I found was the key that will open the chamber-door, and the other key opened a box; when we took her up she owned she let a shoemaker have 4 pounds in Clare-market.
The Prisoner said the door was open.

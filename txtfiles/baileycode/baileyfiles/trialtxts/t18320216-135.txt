            . I live opposite to Mr. Lloyd - he is a hosier
, and lives in Great Portland-street


. On the 26th of January, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another lad lurking about his shop - I watched them, and saw the other loose the flannel from a string; the prisoner was then about twenty yards from him - the other went and spoke to him, and then walked back to the flannel; the prisoner put his shoulder down, and the other halped the flannel on his shoulder - I ran out, and called Stop thief! - the prisoner threw the flannel down, and ran, but I pursued, and did not lose sight of him till he was taken.

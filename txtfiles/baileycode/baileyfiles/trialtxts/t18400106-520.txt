was indicted

 for feloniously receiving of a certain evil-disposed person, on the 
1st of January, 1 bridle, value 2l., the goods of

JOHN STIMSON.
I am clerk to an attorney in Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square, and am nearly sixteen years old. On the 1st of January, about nine o'clock, I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Queen-street, and another one coming up Queen-street with a bundle under his arm—the prisoner said to him, "Go on, you b—fool"—I suspected and watched them—the other one crossed over to the other side of the way till he got to Regent-street—the prisoner followed—they joined each other, and the other one gave the bundle to the prisoner, and walked away—the prisoner crossed over and went to the corner of Woodstock-street—I ran to the police-station and gave information to a policeman, who took him.





JOHN ROCHE.
I am a policeman. Stimson came and told me something—I went into Oxford-street and saw the prisoner walking along the coach rank—I went and laid hold of him—he had a bundle under his arm—I asked what he had—he said, "I don't know"—I asked where he got it—he said, "I picked it up in the street"—I took him to the stationhouse, opened the bundle, and found this bridle in it—he then stated he picked it up in Marlborough-street—he was remanded to make inquiry, and the owner was found.





WILLIAM WEBS.
I am ostler to Mr. Osborne, in King's Mews, King'sroad, Gray's-inn-lane. Mr. John Baker has horses standing there—I know this bridle to be his.




GUILTY.† Aged 20.—

LIONEL PRAGER GOLDSMID, ESQ.
 On the 11th of October, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Regent-street


 with Mr. Angerstein - we were coming from Warren's hotel, and in consequence of what Mr. Angerstein said to me, I observed the prisoner running away -I immediately felt in my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone; I pursued, and just as I came up to him a Policeman stopped him, and asked if I had lost my handkerchief; he pointed to it laying in the mud, about five yards off, saying he had seen him throw it away.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner running with the handkerchief in his hand; he was coming towards me - Mr. Goldsmid was in pursuit, and a few yards before he came up to me I saw him drop the handkerchief out of his hand; I immediately collared him, and Mr. Goldsmid took it up.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the play, which made me out late - I saw a boy run from behind some gentlemen, and run between the coaches; as I came up the gentleman caught me - he said, "What have you been doing?" and thinking the boy had done something to them, I ran between the coaches after him.

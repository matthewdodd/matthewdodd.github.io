             depos'd, That he went to the Bank the Day laid in the Indictment to receive the Sum of 1400 and odd Pounds, that he apply'd to one Mr. Banks, a Teller, and gave him Effects for the said Sum; that he received a Bag with a 1000 Pound in Part, and he turn'd the Money out on the Counter, and as he was telling the Money, he saw a Stick in the Prisoner's Hand with a Piece of Clay upon it; that he catch'd hold of the Stick, took off the Guinea, and threw it to the Heap on the Counter; that the Prisoner was drawing away the Stick, and had separated the Guinea from the Heap about 5 or 6 Inches. He added, that the Prisoner being carry'd before Alderman Baylis, owned, that he had taken a Guinea in the same manner that he design'd to have taken that which he stopt him in taking.

             depos'd, That the Prosecutor coming to him with an order for 1400 l. he gave him a Bag of a 1000 l. and that telling it over again after the Prisoner's Commission of the Fact, there wanted just one Guinea.
The Prisoner pleaded, That being under great Necessity, he did go to the Bank of England to get a Bill discounted, or borrow Money upon it, and being in much Distraction and Confusion, scarce knew what he did; the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

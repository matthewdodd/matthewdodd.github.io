                  Hall 
               



             , the 7th of September
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Tools were lost from some Buildings in Mark-Lane


, and that the Prisoner being suspected, and apprehended, he confess'd where he had hid the Goods and Tools, and they were found accordingly in Billiter-Lane; the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

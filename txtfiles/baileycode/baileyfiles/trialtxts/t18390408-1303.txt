1303. 




JAMES SMITH
 was again indicted

for embezzlement.






ROBERT GLENDENNING
. I am a baker. The prisoner was with me about twelve months—he received monies on my account, and should account for them the day he received them.





ELIZABETH METCALF
. I deal with the prosecutor—on the 22nd of May I paid the prisoner 5s. 8d., on the 30th of May 4s. 01/2d., and on the the 6th of June 3s. 9d.—he gave me these receipts for them.

MR. GLENDENNING
re-examined. The prisoner never paid these sums—I spoke to him about them—he said Mrs. Metcalf would pay next week—he repeated that observation whenever I mentioned it—each of these bills that were sent in to the customer, have the words "Bill delivered" scratched out.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you question him every week? A. Perhaps Dot every week; but every time I asked him, his answer invariably was, she would pay next week—she is a very respectable woman, and I would have trusted her 20l.—the prisoner lived in my house—I do not think he was in distress—he had 18s. a week, and lodging, bread, and so on—he was not allowed to deduct his wages out of what he took—I paid him every Saturday night.
(Samuel Smith, a shoemaker, of Union-street; and Mrs. Smith, a school-mistress, of Dorset-court, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am the master of the Jack Tar, vessel
, which laid off Rotherhithe


. On the 20th of October, I was sleeping in the state room. I hung my clothes up, and about half-past twelve o'clock, I heard somebody in the cabin - I jumped out of bed, and caught the prisoner with my clothes - he dropped them on the floor, and asked for mercy.

                  , from his person
            .
THOMAS LEACH STREET. I am clerk to a solicitor
, and live in Upper Seymour-street. On the 3d of July, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on Holborn-hill


, a few paces from Field-lane; I did not perceive my handkerchief taken, but Moulding passed me - I then suspected it was gone; Sage immediately passed me, and joined him; I then missed my handkerchief - it was safe when I left my office in Mincing-lane. I stopped them both, and charged them with it - Moulding denied it - Sage said nothing; I found it in Moulding's coat pocket; a person assisted me in taking them to the watch-house; I met Lock, and gave them in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)


                  GEORGE 
                  LOCK
               



            . I am a constable. Mr. Street gave the prisoners into my charge. Sage said he did not do it, and knew nothing of the other.
MOULDING'S Defence. I was going up Field-lane, to Mr. Barret's, of Liquor-pond-street, where I have worked four years, and picked the handkerchief up; several people said they saw me pick it up, and told him to let me go.
MR. STREET. Nobody said so.
MOULDING - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 17.

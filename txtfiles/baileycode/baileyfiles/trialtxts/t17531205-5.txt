, the Prisoner had been my Servant
 about five Days. She went out on the 2nd of December, and in about an Hour's Time I had two or three People come, who told me I had been robbed. I went with them to the House of one Morgan, a Lodging House in Golden Lane. There lay all the Goods mentioned in two Chairs. The Prisoner was there; she burst out a crying, and asking Forgiveness owned the taking the Things away. The Things produced in Court and deposed to. I sent for an Officer, after which before him she owned the same as before; then I took her before an Alderman, where she owned the same.

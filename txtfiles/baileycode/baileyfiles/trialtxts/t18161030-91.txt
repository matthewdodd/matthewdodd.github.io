            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 28th of September, about half past five, in consequence of information I received from 
               
                  William 
                  Shepherd
               



            , I followed the prisoner, and stopped him in Newman-street, with the three lamp glasses in question in a basket. I asked him where he got them; he gave me no answer to that question, but said he hoped I would shew him mercy, for he was sure to be transported.

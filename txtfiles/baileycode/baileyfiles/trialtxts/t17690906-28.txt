            . I am a watchman in Oxford-Road. About half an hour after ten o'clock that night the prisoner brought these goods to a woman at an old clothes shop, but the woman did not choose to buy them, and she charged me with her. I took her and the bundle to the watch-house. After that I found the prosecutor, who owned them. (Produced in court.)

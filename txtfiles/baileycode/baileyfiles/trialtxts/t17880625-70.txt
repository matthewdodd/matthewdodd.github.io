             sworn.
I am a porter
 at an inn, I had been with a parcel to Bethnal Green, as I was coming back again past the end of Beech-lane


, the prisoner stopped me, and asked me where I was going, I told her where all honest people ought to be; she said come along with me Ned, I had not been with her a minute, before I missed a half-guinea of the new coin, and 2 s. out of my breeches-pocket.
When had you seen the money? - When I was at Bethnal Green, and I had never had my hand in my pocket for any thing from that time till I met with her, I charged her with it, and she said she would poke my bloody eve out, for accusing her with a false accusation, that though she was a woman, she had fought a better man than I; the watchman came by, and I gave charge of her; there was 2 s. found in herpocket, and a half-guinea of the new coin inclosed in her left-hand between two fingers.
JOHN NIWMAN sworn.
I was the constable of the night, I observed that the prisoner when she was brought to the watch-house, she kept two of her fingers closed, I opened them and took out a half-guinea of the new coin, and 2 s. out of her pocket.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
It was my own money, I did not take any from the man.

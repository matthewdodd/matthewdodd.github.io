            . On the 18th of October I was going down Corporation-lane


 about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came up, snatched my watch out, and ran away with it; I followed him, giving an alarm - he was taken and my watch produced.

            . I was coming down Rosamond-street, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me; I crossed the street and stopped him. He said he was not the thief, and begged me to let him go. I said I must be better satisfied of that - he immediately threw the watch out of his hand into an area.

            . I live in Butterland-street, East-road, City-road, and am a watchmaker. I went with my wife and children to Whitecross-street


, on Saturday evening, the 12th of May; my wife went into a butcher's shop: I went on with the two children - I saw the prisoner pass me two or three times: my daughter Emma had a necklace on - I had hold of her hand, and felt her flinch; I missed the necklace from her neck, and saw the prisoner running round the corner - I went up to him, and he threw it down; I took it up, and took him to the officer - several of the bends were lost by the fall.

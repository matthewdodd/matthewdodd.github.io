            . I have known the two prisoners eight or nine years, the night before the 28th of last March I and the two prisoners agreed to go Finchley on that day to take some pigs from Mr. Robertson's, but

             saying that three would be too many, it was determined that he should stay at Islington, expecting after we had taken some away, Mr. Cobley would come to him to enquire if he had seen them, and to let us know, when we returned home, if there had been an outcry after them; then John and I went about half an hour after twelve at night, and took thirteen from out of Mr. Robertson's yard; we drove them cross the country, we sold one for 13 s. 6 d. beyond Tottenham, after that we sold two to a butcher at Walthamslow for 20 s. then we sold ten more to a Gentleman for 6 l. coming home I lost two half guineas out of my pocket; we divided the money we had left, I had to my share 56 s. and John 56 s. and his brother Will had a guinea, but he said, if he had not more he would blow us; then I went to Finchley, and Mr. Robertson had me apprehended, and I owned the taking them, and who was with me, and also where we had sold the pigs.

            . I am servant to Mr. Robertson at Finchley, he sells hogs in a yard there, these pigs we had lost were sent out of the country, and put into our yard amongst others, they are the goods of Mr.

                  Morris 
               



            ; after the evidence had confessed the stealing them, and told where he had sold them, I went and saw that which was sold for 13 s. 6 d. and seven others, all which I knew to be Mr. Morris's.

             in Lincolnshire, I brought upwards of two hundred pigs from Lincolnshire to Finchley, they were put into Mr. Robertson's yard, in one pen were fourteen on the 27th of March at night, and in the morning there was but one left.

            . I am a higher, and live at Walthamslow, on the 28th of March I bought ten pigs of

             for 6 l. I sold four of them to my landlord, and four more to Mr. Brucas in White-Chapel, and kept two myself.

            . I bought two pigs of

                  Rock 
               



             and Banister for 20 s. on the Tuesday after I read the advertisement of the pigs being stolen; I went to Finchley to enquire about them, and there was the evidence Banister, so we apprehended him and he owned the fact.

             would not let me alone, but would go with me when he found I had a little money to earn, and as we were coming to London he started the question to me to come the next day and take some pigs away; that day I was fuddled, and the next night I went along with him, and we took the pigs out and sold them, we had 3 l. 7 s. each; this young man (meaning the other prisoner) had not a farthing of the money, neither did I see him till the Friday following; the two half guineas, Banister said he lost, we divided between Banister and me.

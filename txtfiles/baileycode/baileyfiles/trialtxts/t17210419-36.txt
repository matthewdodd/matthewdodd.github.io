, about 5 a Clock the Morning aforesaid; that he had been drinking with some Friends in London, but could not tell where the Prisoner met with him; that there was another with her; and that the Prisoner did not take it from him, but it was found upon her. Three other Evidences confirmed the finding the Watch upon the Prisoner; that she refused to deliver it, saying it was her own Watch, and they had nothing to do with it; and that her Father sent it to her with two Silver Tankards from Bristol. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that the Prosecutor brought a Woman to the House where she lodged, and knockt them up, that the Woman he brought gave her the Watch to give to him again, which she intended to have done, and therefore refused to deliver it to any Body else. The Jury considering that the Prosecutor did not charge the Prisoner with taking the Watch from him, found her

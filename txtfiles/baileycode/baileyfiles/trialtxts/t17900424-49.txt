I missed two hats; one was my master's, which I wear, the other was Symons's, the other servant; they were hanging in the hall; I saw them half an hour before; I saw the prisoner running down the street with them, and took him.
Prisoner. Before the lord mayor he said he did not know me before? - I told the same story before the lord mayor.

I was standing at the opposite door, and saw the prisoner and another man go backwards and forwards by Mr. Smalley's house; and I saw the other man point to the prisoner; and the prisoner went in; and I saw him come out with two hats in his hand: I went over the way, and informed the servant.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I met a servant that said he had two hats to sell; I deal in old clothes.

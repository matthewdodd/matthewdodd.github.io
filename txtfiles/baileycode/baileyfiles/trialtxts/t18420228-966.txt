JOHN OLIVER
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of December, 1 watch-guard, value 9s., the goods of 




Henry Scott.






HENRY SCOTT
. I live in Old-street, St. Luke's, and am a looking-glass maker. The prisoner lodged at my sister's—I left a writing-desk at my sister's about two years ago, and on the 3rd of December I placed this watch-guard in the desk, which was not locked—the guard is worth about 9s. 6d.—I missed it on the 24th of December—the policeman came to me afterwards and said he had found the duplicate on the prisoner—I went to the pawnbroker's and found the guard—this now produced is it.





JOHN THOMAS LEACH
. I am in the employ of Mr. Walker, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road. This silver watch-guard was pawned with me on the 16th of December, in the name of John Oliver—the prisoner's person is familiar to me—he has pawned a great many things—this is the duplicate I gave for it.





THOMAS FEW
. I took the prisoner on the 3rd of February—I found a number of duplicates on him—this is one of them.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Baldwin's-gardens


. On the 22d of November, about a quarter past five o'clock, the prisoner came in to buy a pair of shoes, and tried on six pairs, and at last found one to fit him, which came to 10 s.; he offered 9 s., which I refused, and shewed him some at 7 s., which did not suit him, and while I was putting them away, I missed a pair off the board. He was going out, wishing me good night - I turned round and secured him on the step, pulled him into the shop, found his trowsers were tied at the knee, and the shoes in them. He said I had not found them on him. He only had 4 s. 6 d.
Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing whatever belonging to him.

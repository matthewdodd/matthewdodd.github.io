            ; they are silkmen

, in Cheapside


. On the 15th of June, the prisoner, Young, came to our shop, about half past six in the evening; he said, have you got any good silk twist. I shewed him some of various sizes; he asked the price; I told him forty-eight shillings a pound; he said, weigh me out ten pounds, which done he asked me if we had any white three cord silk. I shewed him some of various sizes; then he said, weigh me out five pounds. He then asked if we had any blue three cord; I shewed him some; he desired me to weigh him up two pounds weight. There was not quite enough of the blue; I put in two skeins of the white to make up the two pounds. He then said that he was recommended by Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Ralph
               



            , of St. James's-street. He had been a customer of ours some years back. We had no dealings with Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Ralph
               



             for some time previous to this.
Q. Is the 
               
                  John 
                  Ralph
               



             at the bar now, the Ralph who had been a customer to your master - A. No. Young then said that he had been purchasing that morning, and had laid out one hundred and forty pound, and had paid ready money; now, he said, I hope you you will let me have this as low as you can. At this time Young was alone. He then requested a bill of parcels to be made. I asked him his name; he said, 
               
                  James 
                  Young
               



            . I made out the bill of parcels, and took the discount off. These goods were to be sent, and a bill of parcels with them, and the money was to be returned by the bearer.
JURY. Was the discount that you took off a discount for ready money - A. Yes, and I delivered the bill of parcels myself into the prisoner. Young's, hands. The porter took the receipt in his pocket. I deducted the discount by his request. He told me he should pay me ready money when he took the bill of parcels. He said, make them up securely, to keep them dry, and send them up to the Cross Keys, St. John-street. He introduced himself that he kept a grinder's shop at St. Alban's. A grinder's shop is a-shop that supplies shoemakers with what they want.
Q. Does the St. Alban's coach go from the Cross Keys in St. John-street - A. No, I believe not. I believe he repeated the second time to send them to St. John-street as soon as possible, and when he left the shop he said I shall trust to your honour. I packed them up in three parcels, and put the name of Young upon them. I then wrote a receipt, and gave it the porter, (his name is Price) together with instructions not to leave them without the money. The prisoner, Young, said, send the goods and the receipt by the porter, to the Cross Keys, and I will return the money by the bearer.


                  WILLIAM 
                  PRICE
               



            . I am a porter to Messrs. Brant and Delannay. I saw the prisoner, Young, at my master's house on the 15th of June last. I have no doubt of his person in the least.
Q. Were you ordered by the witness to take a parcel - A. Yes, three parcels directed to Mr. 
               
                  James 
                  Young
               



             each parcel, and tied up in brown paper. I put the parcels in a bag when I went out, to keep them dry. Mr. Dickman gave me a receipt; I put the receipt in my pocket, I was to deliver the goodsto the prisoner Young. I met him in the gateway. On my delivering the goods the money was to be returned. Forty-two, pounds seven shillings was the money I was to receive. I met the prisoner, Young, in the gateway; he asked me if I had not got some goods for him. I said, yes. He asked me to walk into the parlour, and the money, he said, should be paid immediately. He asked me to drink. I had some rum and water with him. I took the goods out of the bag; I placed them on the table near me; I asked the prisoner, Young, whether Molloy belonged to him; he said he did; Young said he was his servant. Molloy heard this. Young said he always took him with him; he had a horse and chaise up the yard. Young took the parcels off the table, and gave them to Molloy; he said, take them up to your mistress. and bring down forty-two pounds seven shillings. I should not have let the parcel have been taken out of the room if the money had not been talked of. I, at the moment, believed that the money would be brought down directly. The prisoner said that he had a house and a little land at St. Alban's, (that was after the goods were taken up stairs), which enabled him to pay ready money for the goods he bought. In the mean time he called for another glass of rum and water. I told him I did not wish for any more; I was waiting for the money. He then said his servant was gone a good while for the money, but his wife had got some friends up stairs in one part, and he had his friends in another. He then said, you will excuse me, I'll go up stairs and fetch down the money. My curiosity led me to enquire at the bar. I then went home. I have since seen the silk at the office.
COURT. Did you ever see Ralph during this - A. No, I did not. On my going home I met Mr. Dickman; I told him every thing that had taken place. Then Mr. Dickman and I went back to the Cross Keys; we made enquiries after Young and Molloy; we were unsuccessful. There were no such persons there, nor had there been any horse and chaise in the yard of theirs.

            . In June last I was waiter at the Cross Keys; I saw Young and Molloy there on the 15th of June, and I remember Price, the porter, being there the same evening.
Q. Was Young living there at the time - A. No, sir, he never slept there to my knowledge.
Q. Had he any wife occupying any part of the house - A. Never to my knowledge. I never saw him in the house before that day. He had not any horse and chaise there. He had been in our house before once in the course of the same day. I saw Molloy go along the passage, towards the front door. I did not see him go out of the house. He did not go up stairs. I did not see Young go out. I demanded the money for the two glasses of rum and water of Price, the porter. I knew nothing of the parties.

            . I am a shoemaker.
Q. Are you the landlord of the house in which Young lived - A. Yes, No. 66, Red-lion-street, Holborn.
Q. How long has Young lodged at your house - A. Not a week. On the 16th, I think Young and Ralph brought the silk in, at ten o'clock at night, I saw the parcels, I found they contained silk when they were opened. Young lodged in the garret. Read, the officer, came and took the silk after Molloy and Ralph were apprehended.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Ralph and Molloy in Red-lion-square, on Thursday, the 17th of June, about one o'clock. I told them I took them about silk. They laid it all to Young. I apprehended Young on the same day, in Kingsgate-street. I told him what he was taken for. He said his wife had brought him into a great deal of trouble. I went to Carr's house after I took Molloy and Ralph, and brought the silk to the office. This is the silk.
Dickman. This is the same silk and the same writing on the parcel. It is the property of Messrs. Brant and Delannay.
Young's Defence. I bought the goods with intention to pay for them. I sent for the money. I had been deceived by my wife. These other men had no concern in it.
Molloy's Defence. Young told me he wanted a suit of clothes; he asked me to take measure of him, and to go with him to St John-street to buy the cloth. He gave me a pound note at the Cross Keys; he said take this to the bar to my wife, and tell her to come in with the contents of the bill. He came after me, and said, is she here? I said, no. He then said, she must be in Gray's-inn-lane, give me the parcel. I gave him the parcel, and he went out.
Ralph was not put on his defence.

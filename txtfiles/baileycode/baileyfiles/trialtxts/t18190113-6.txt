            . I am servant to Mr. Clarkson Palmer, an haberdasher
, who lives at London Bridge


. On the 26th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some ribbon. I shewed her a drawer of ribbon. She concealed one piece in her pocket, and asked for some narrower than the others - I showed her some more, and saw her take another piece out of that drawer, and put it into her pocket - she bought one yard of twopenny ribbon. I asked her to step back into the warehouse, as I wanted to speak to her. She immediately ran out, I pursued, and brought her back. I sent for an officer, who searched her, but could not find them - they were found on the ground near the spot where I took her. I saw her conceal them - another woman stood close to her, but did not appear concerned with her - she remained in the shop, and bought some goods.
HENRY MURRAY. I am shopman to Mr. Palmer. I saw the ribbon found in the road, at the spot where I saw Davies scuffling with the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. When I got to the door, he said I had got the ribbon. I went back with him directly - I had none. In about half an hour a man brought it back, and said he found it.

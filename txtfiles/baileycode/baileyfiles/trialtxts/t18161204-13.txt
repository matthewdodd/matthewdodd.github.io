            . I am a salesman in Newgate-market
, on the 2d of November, between six and seven o'clock in the morning. I had a quantity of pigs hanging up for sale; I had been informed that there was a bad character about the market, and I set a watch to look after them. The pig belonged to me.
JAMES BOOTH. I was set to watch; and I observed the prisoner walking backwards and forwards, with a skewer in his hand; the moment Mr. Pocklington's back was turned the prisoner stuck the skewer in the belly of the pig and walked away with it. I told Mr. Pocklington and he went after him, and took him.
Prisoner. I am a porter in the market; a man asked me to carry it, and I did.

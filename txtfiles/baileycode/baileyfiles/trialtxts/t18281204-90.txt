            . I am the wife of James Aussinder, and live in Phillips-street, Kingsland-road


; the prisoner lodged in the same house for about three weeks. On the 16th of August I saw the watch safe, and missed it that day; it had been under my pillow - I had been confined to my bed, and the prisoner was nursing me: I gave her her food for what she did - I never authorised her to take it.

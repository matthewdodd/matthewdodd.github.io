JOHN WITTLE
. I am shopman to Mr. Henry Lee, a linendraper, in Leather-lane. About five o'clock in the evening, on the 20th of Jan., I missed 25 yards of Orleans cloth from inside the door—I went, and saw the prisoner standing outside, near the door—I gave her into custody.





JOSEPH BAILEY
. I live in Upper North-place, Gray's-inn-road. About five o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner and another woman standing at the corner of the prosecutor's shop, at the corner of Baldwin's-gardens—the prisoner took the cloth from the right-hand side of the door, and gave it to the other woman—I am sure the prisoner is the woman that took it—I went into the shop, and the other woman was gone.

Prisoner. Q. Did you touch me on the back? A. No.

Prisoner's Defence. He touched me on the back, and said, "I saw you take something, and give it to that woman, who is gone across the road;" I said, "If you saw a woman go across the road, why did you not stop her?"




GUILTY
. * Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

GEORGE LIPSCOMB. I am a groom
. On the 18th of April I missed these articles - they had been hanging upon a nail in the stable, in Moor-lane, St. Martin's-lane


; I missed them a few minutes before six o'clock in the morning - I had seen the hat, shoes, and keys the night before, between six and seven o'clock, and the waistcoat I believe was there, but I did not notice it - I knew the prisoners well.

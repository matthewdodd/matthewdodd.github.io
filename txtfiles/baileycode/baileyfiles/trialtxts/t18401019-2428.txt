. I am a constable. On the 21st of September I saw the two prisoners together in Wimpole-street—I followed them to Baker-street, and I saw Perry take a pint pot from No. 19—Ryley was close to her, and joined her—I then caught Perry, and took from her the pint pot—I asked what she was going to do—she made no reply—I then took Ryley, and from her apron took four more pots—these are them.

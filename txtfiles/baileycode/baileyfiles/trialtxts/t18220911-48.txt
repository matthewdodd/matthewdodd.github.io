            . I am a marshalsman. On Friday the 30th of August, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, I was going up Long-lane with a prisoner, and saw the prisoner at the bar, standing at the corner of Red Cow passage, leading into Cloth Fair, I observed something bulky under his great coat; I passed him a few paces and turned round; he was running; I left my prisoner in charge,and followed and overtook him in Middle-street, Cloth Fair; I pulled open his coat and found this Irish linen; he said he picked it up, but did not say where. In taking him to the Compter he said it belonged to him, for he bought it. I found the owner.

PATRICK MURPHY
. I lodge in George-street, St. Giles's. On Saturday night, the 30th of July, I was coming home, and met the prisoner in the street—I asked her the way to George-street, St. Giles's—she told me the would take me there—as she was going on my right hand side, she took my watch from my right-hand waistcoat pocket—she ran off, and I after her—there were some persons who struck me—I have got the marks now—I went home and told the policeman, and he found her in about two hour—there were three men knocking me about—I should not know the men—the watch has not been found.

Prisoner. He is taking me for another female—the officer knows the same.





THOMAS FULEER
 (police-constable G 155.) I received information from Patrick Murphy, about ten o'clock that night—he described the prisoner's person, and I took her at half-past twelve o'clock—she was with another person, a most notorious character—I went and took the prosecutor, and he pointed her out instantly—he said he pursued her, and just as he was getting hold of her, he was knocked down—I knew the prisoner from the description he gave me—I had known her for years.

Prisoner. The prosecutor was in liquor. Witness. No, he was not in the least.

Prisoner. There was another female taken with me, he did not know which it was. Witness. No, he did not at all hesitate.




GUILTY

            . I live in Wilson-street, St. John-street-road, and am one of the City night patrol
. On the 3d of September, about twelve o'clock, I was at Bartholomew fair


 - just as the fair was being proclaimed, I felt a pressure at my pocket, and, on putting my hand down, missed my handkerchief, which was safe just before. I immediately turned round - the prisoner was exactly behind me - other persons were near me, but not so near my pocket as him. I laid hold of him, and found my handkerchief on the ground, within about two feet of him - he said he had done nothing. I picked it up, and am positive it is mine.

            . I was at the fair, and saw the prisoner and Wall; there was a great pressure just after the fair was proclaimed - the pick-pockets were very active - I drew back a little, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Wall's pocket. I collared him immediately, and he threw it down.

            . I am a licensed victualler
. The prisoner was going out of my house, and my servant was coming in; he and three others had had three quarts of ale. In consequence of information I received, I pulled him in again, and found nine goblets in his coat pockets; they might be worth eight shillings; they cost me that; some were whole and some were broken.

            . I met the prisoner going out of my master's house, and hearing glass rattle in his pocket, I stopped him; I was struggling with him, as he wanted to get past me, when my master came up, and seized him.

            . I know nothing of this matter, any more than apprehending the prisoner, and on searching him found a large bunch of keys, one of which was a skeleton key.

Prisoner's Defence. I leave it all to my counsel.

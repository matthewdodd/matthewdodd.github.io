FREDERICK WISE
. I am an apprentice on board the brig Sisters. On Friday, the 30th of March, I missed my watch from the cabin, about one o'clock—this is it—(looking at it)—the prisoners had been employed on board that day to clean the cabin.

Wood. When we went down into the cabin he was drinking spirits—he gave us some, and having had no victuals that morning, it made us drunk Witness. I did not give them any—they were not drunk.





JAMES THORNE
. I am a watchmaker at Limehouse. On Friday last, about two o'clock, the prisoners came to sell me this watch, and asked if it was silver—I gave them 6s. for it, which was the full value—they afterwards returned and wanted it back, but I had received information previously, and they were taken into custody—they were not drunk the first time they came, but they were afterwards.






JOSEPH MONTAGUE
. I am a policeman. When I took the prisoners hey had no money.
(The prisoners put in a written Defence, stating that they had picked up the patch which was lying about on the deck, and thinking it of no value, gave it to a child to play with on board, and that being in want of food afterwards, they took it to the watchmaker, and finding it was silver, sold it to him for 6s.)

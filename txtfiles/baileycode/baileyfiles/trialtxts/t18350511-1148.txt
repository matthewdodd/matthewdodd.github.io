WILLIAM STEWART MATTHEWS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
4th of April, 8 spoons, value 6l.; and 1 fork, value 18s.; the goods of 



Susan Saunders, his mistress, in her dwelling-house.






SUSAN SAUNDERS
. I live at No. 6, Golden-square. The prisoner lived with me as footman—he absconded on the 5th of April, and the greater part of my plate was missing—he had the care of it—I examined it truth him when he came into my service in the Spring of last year—he was thirteen months in my service—when he was gone I missed sixteen or seventeen spoons, and three forks—I think the whole was worth about 10l.—these spoons are mine, they have my name on them.





GEORGE FARMER
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Wardour-street—I produce these spoons—they were pawned at different times by the prisoner—he had redeemed them and pledged them again.





GEORGE STONE
 (police-constable C 99.) I went after the prisoner—I found him in Barlow-court, Marylebone—I told him I wanted him for robbing his late mistress—he said he thought it was all dropped, as his father had called there—he told me the best part of the plate was at Mr. Harrison's, in Wardour-street, and some at Mr. Alderson's—he said he had been out drinking, and had not the money to redeem it, and he went away.




GUILTY of stealing of the value of 99s. Aged 18.—Recommended to



mercy by the Prosecutrix and Jury.—


Transported for Seven Years.

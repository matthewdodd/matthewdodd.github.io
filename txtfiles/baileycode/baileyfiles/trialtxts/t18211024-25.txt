            . I live at Bedford. On the 9th of October, I was in town, and about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was on Fish-street-hill


, my handkerchief was in my coat pocket - I was alone going towards the Borough, and saw the prisoner with four or five others; I suspected something, felt and missed my handkerchief, it was safe five minutes before - I felt it pulled out of my pocket, and saw the prisoner cross the road with it in his hand - I crossed after him, he turned round, saw me, and immediately ran off - I called Stop thief! he was stopped before I lost sight of him, near Thames-street, by two soldiers, one of them threw him down, and I found the handkerchief under him.

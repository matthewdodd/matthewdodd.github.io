            . I am constable of Bow-street. On the 9th of November, about 12 o'clock at night, I met the prisoner at Cambden-town with this shovel and sack; I asked him where he got them. He swore he would neither tell me or any one else. I secured him.
Prisoner. Q. Did I not come over the way to you? - A. Yes. I had three men with me. He would not tell us his name, or where he lived - at the watch-house he said it was Brown, but refused to say where he lived.

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of July, I was in St. Martin's-court; I saw the prisoner with his knee against the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief out of the prosecutor's right hand pocket; I jumped up to the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him. I then said to the prosecutor, you have lost your handkerchief. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket.
Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief.

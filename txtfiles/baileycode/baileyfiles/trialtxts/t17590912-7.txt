            . I live near Cold-Bath-Field's


: the prisoner was my servant
 for about half a year: I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I suspected the prisoner, and took her up and carried her before Justice Welch: there she confessed she had taken the things, and I found them again by her direction at divers places, where she owned she had taken and carried them. Produced in court and deposed to.

Q. Were there any promises of favour, if she would confess and tell where they were?
Parham. I do not know of any made her.
Q. to Prosecutor. Did you make her any promise to be favourable, if she would tell the truth.

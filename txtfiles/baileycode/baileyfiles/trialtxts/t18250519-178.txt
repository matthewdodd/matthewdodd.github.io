            . I am an officer. On the 7th of May, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in Long-lane


, and saw Williams walking too and fro by Mr. Bowden's shop - he is a hatter
; he gave his name as Richard at the office - he is not here. I watched for nearly half an hour; Williams went over the road, and spoke to Johnson six times. I saw Johnson come over twice, and look into the shop; he returned, and stood on the opposite side of the way. I saw Williams take a hat from the door post, and turn down the corner, when I collared him, with it in his possession; Johnson stood on the opposite side of the way - I took him before he could get away; it is a new hat, marked 14 s.
JOHNSON'S Defence. I was coming down Long-lane - a person asked me the way to the Old Bailey, and I had not proceeded twenty yards before the officer collared me - I was not in this man's company.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 24.
Both 



               Transported for Seven Years

were indicted for stealing, on the 
10th of November, 56 yards of printed gingham, value 15s., the goods of 




Michael Smith; and that Thorpe and White had been before convicted of felony.






MICHAEL SMITH
. I am a draper, and live in Crawford-street. On the 10th of November, two of the prisoners were brought into my shop by Mr. Hunt, with this printed gingham, which is mine—it had been tied on a bundle outside the door.





JAMES HUNT
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Crawford-street. About two o'clock that day I saw the prisoners go to the prosecutor's shop and take the gingham now produced—they all three took hold of it and lugged at it together—I cannot say which of them took it, but I saw it first on Hill—I ran and took Hill—the other two walked a short distance and then ran—I am sure of their persons, and swear to them.





JOHN BERRY
 (police-constable D 88.) I was coming down Crawford-street on the 10th of November—I saw Hill drop something, and the other two running away from him—I took White, and took Hill from Mr. Hunt—Thorpe was running away, but was brought back by some person.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFF
. I produce a certificate of White's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Surrey—(read—he is the boy.





JAMES BROOK
. I produce a certificate of Thorpe's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace, of Surrey—(read)—he is the boy.

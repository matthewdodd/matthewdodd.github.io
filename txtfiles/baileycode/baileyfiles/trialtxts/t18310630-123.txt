            . I am the wife of John Miles. The prisoner came into my service on the 26th of May, and about the 14th of June, I sent her out on an errand, at eight o'clock in the morning - I expected her to return about one, but I heard nothing of her till eight at night, when the Police-constable came, and asked if I had lost any thing; I looked, and missed a brooch, a piece of silk, and a table-cloth.

            . I am a Policeman. I found the prisoner intoxicated, in Windmill-street - she had a small basket with her, in which I found this piece of silk, and in her pockets were two duplicates of the other articles.

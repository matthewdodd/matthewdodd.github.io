            , of Ware. I cannot read - I put it in the waggon and drove it to Smithfield, and then to the the Cherry-Tree public-house, Kingsland-road - when I got there I saw it safe. I went to get some refreshment after taking the horses out, and when I returned I put the horses in again, and had got on the road, about a quarter of a mile, when I looked over the waggon and found the parcel was gone.

                  WILLIAM 
                  WELLS
               



            . I live in Wellington-street, Kings-land-road. I was at the corner of Caroline-street, between seven or eight o'clock on the evening of the 12th of October, and saw the two male prisoners coming up the road. I knew them by sight before. I saw Briggs get into a waggon on the opposite side of the way, near the Cherry-Tree. I then saw Carter get in - there was another person with them, who had got into the waggon before them, three different times; they were not all in at once, but one got in after the other got out. I saw Carter pulling at the luggage near the back of the waggon - I then saw one man standing with his back to the end of the waggon, and Briggs put a parcel on his back; the man brought it on to the other side of the way and walked on to Hare-walk. Carter and Briggs came with him - Carter had been standing at the end of the waggon while the parcel was getting out. I followed them to Playhouse-yard, which is more than a quarter of a mile from the Cherry-Tree; they took the goods into a house there - they had divided them into a butter flat, and a bag, in Hare-walk. I saw the two prisoners and the other person, whose name is Blackford, go into the house in Playhouse-yard, while myself, Taylor, and Archer were watching the prisoners in Hare-walk; the prisoner Carter said that if we did not tell he would give us 5 s. I said I did not want the money - he then said if we did not go away he would punch our heads; the goods were left in the house in Playhouse-yard. I did not see anybody there.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you - A. I am a muffin baker. I know the neighbourhood of Hare-walk - they went down Turner-square to the King of Prussia walk, and from there to Hare-walk; I kept them in view all the time - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; the till of the waggon was open behind; but I cannot tell whether it was up or not.


                  WILLIAM 
                  ARCHER
               



            . I was with the last witness - I saw Blackford get into the waggon twice - he brought out nothing, but when he got in the third time I saw Carter and Briggs at the end of it. I had known them by seeing them about the road. When Blackford came out the third time, he had a hat on his head, and a bundle under his arm. Carter took the bundle from Blackford. Carter and Briggs then got into the waggon, and then came out again - Carter then went in by himself, and then Briggs got in and lifted a pile on to a young man's shoulder - he took it into Hare-walk. Carter, Briggs, and Blackford went with him. I followed them while they took it into a house. Carter came out with a bag, and then Briggs came out with a butter flat, and he went to Turner-square, and put it on his head, and cried out
"Muscles" I heard Carter speak to Wells, but I do not know what he said; they then went into White Cross-street, and then into a house in Playhouse yard.
WILLIAM TAYLOR. I was with Wells and Archer at the corner of Caroline-place, between seven and eight o'clock. I saw the waggon, and saw Blackford go into it twice - he then went into it again, and brought out a bundle; I saw Carter and Briggs walking about the house - I then saw Briggs get into the waggon and then come out and go round to the back part of it - he opened the flap of the waggon and took out a large square thing, which he put on the shoulders of another man. Carter, Briggs, and the man with the load then went down Hare-walk; I followed them, but did not see them go into any house; I stood at the corner of the walk, and they soon came out with the things in a butter flat and some bags; I do not know where they got the butter flat from; they came round to the corner where I was - Briggs had the butter-flat, and put it on his head, and cried
"Muscles." Carter went up Hoxton; I then saw them go into the house in Playhouse-yard. I heard them say they would give us 5 s. a piece if we did not tell, but I do not know what else was said: I did not follow them any farther, but went home and told my father of it, and he told the hostler at the Cherry Tree.
Cross-examined. Q. What trade are you - A. I work with my father, who is a bricklayer. I have known the prisoners by seeing them about the road before. I had heard Blackford's name because he used to go to a chair maker's by us.


                  SAMUEL 
                  TAYLOR
               



            . I am father of the last witness - he told me on the 12th of October what he had seen, and I told Mr. Smith of it.

                  SMITH

                  Taylor
               



             sent for me to the Cherry Tree; I went with him, young Taylor, and Archer to Playhouse-yard, to the prisoner Nathan's - she opened the door; I said,
"You have got some things brought here by some young lads;" she said,
"These are the things;" they were under the counter. She passed by me to shut the door as I supposed, but she went out; some man gave me the things, which I took to the office: they were in a handkerchief, a cross handled basket, and a dirty bag. I went next morning to her again, and said,
"You have told me false, you have not given me all the things:" she said they was all - I searched, but found no more.
Cross-examined. Q. What age is Mr. Nathan's son - A. He appears to be about thirty years of age; I do not know that he has absconded. After she had been to the office she was discharged, and came back of her own accord.


                  GEORGE 
                  CHAPEL
               



            . I am hostler at the Cherry Tree. I went with the last witness to Mrs. Nathan's house, and got some property - I saw Smith take it.

                   the younger, a sovereign, and a promissory note for payment of and value 10 l.
            , his property.
WILLIAM FITCH. Last Friday week I received from my father a 10 l. note and a sovereign, and came to town; I got on the coach a mile on this side of Romford - the prisoner was on the coach, and I sat against him, behind: we talked as we came along. He said he was going to get off at Stratford, and wanted me to get off, which I did not - as we got on this side Mile End turnpike he got off, and said he meant to stop at the Two Bells, public-house; I got off there, and we had some mutton chops, some bread, and a pint of porter. He then asked me where I was going; I said to White's-place, Pimlico - he said he had a brother who lived near there, and he would go with me: we did so - he then said he was going to Doctors' Commons. We then went to Oxford-street, and into a gin-shop, and had a glass of gin. I had paid for the bread and beer at the Two Bells, and he for the chops. In Oxford-street he went into a baker's shop, and called me in; he asked me what money I had got; I told him, and showed the money, and the baker's wife asked me to leave it there - I said no I would not. I took the money in my hand, and when we got into the street again he asked me if I had got my money all right; I said Yes, and then I felt for it, and it was gone. We then went to North Audley-street, and he got me a lodging. When I told him my money was lost, he said some girl had taken it; I had no girl with me, but he had - the girl he had with him snatched a cane out of my hand which I had, but I had the money in my pocket after the girl was gone; he did not sleep in North Audley-street - I do not know where he slept; he ordered a night's lodging for me, and a pint of beer, which he paid for - he came there the next morning, and said he had been with a girl all night, and he had lost his watch; he then had his breakfast, and was looking at the paper, and said he saw a place, which I went after, he appointed me to meet him at twelve o'clock, at the same place, which I did - he then had a girl with him, and was half tipsy. He was taken into custody that day.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where didyou come from? A. I came from Ingatestone, to get a place. I have told all the story which I told to the Magistrate. The prisoner borrowed 5 s. of me, and I had his watch to keep. I never was in London before, further than Whitechapel. I did not go into either of the parks; I was not in any house with a young lady, nor walking in the park with any. I was in a house where there were some young ladies. The prisoner asked me if I had lost anything after we came out of the baker's-shop - the girl had joined us in Holborn - the baker's-shop is in Oxford-street. I never said the girl had robbed me, and if I could catch her I would cut her throat. About four or five minutes after we came out of the baker's I put my hand into my breeches pocket, and missed my money, but I did not use that expression. I do not know the number of the note; I only know the red mark of
"16" on it; I am sure there is no other red mark on it: here is
"81" in a red mark on it, but that was put on when I was at the Police Office. I considered some time before I gave an answer, but I did not say I was not quite sure about it.
COURT. Q. Did you return the watch to the prisoner? A. Yes, on the same evening, in Oxford-street, because he said his brother would want to know where it was. I had only one sovereign with me; I did not tell the Magistrate I had five - my evidence was read over to me, which I signed. I had some other sovereigns, which I paid at Brentwood, before I saw him - I had but one when he came on the coach. I was not with any girls till I got to town; he took me to some house - that is where he borrowed the 5 s.: we did not stop there more than a quarter of an hour. He went out of the room with a girl, and left me there with several other girls; I sat still, and had no particular conversation with any of them. I know I had the money when we went to the baker's-shop, because I showed it there.

            . I live with Mrs. Adams. On Saturday morning, the 1st of January, I took two half gallons of porter to Great York-mews - the prisoner paid for it with a 10 l. Chelmsford note; the porter came to 1 s. 8 d. I took the note to my mistress - she could not change it, and I took it to Mr. Harper. There was a tear, and a red
"16" on it. I knew the prisoner before, by his coming to the house.

            . Mander brought the note to me - I gave him change, and put Mrs. Adams's name on it.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in Tothill-fields prison; he stated that he had left his place two or three weeks before, and said he had 5 l. or 6 l.; I asked him if that was all, and said he had left a 5 l. note at a public-house, at the corner of East-street and Paddiagton-street - he said No; I said he had, and I should bring the parties forward to prove that he had left it there. I then asked him to recollect himself, and he said if he had he had worked hard for it, and it was his own. He then said he had got it in Scotland, but could not tell the name of the place, and had had it eight or nine months.

             re-examined. This 5 l. note I gave in change for the 10 l. note. I gave the change on the Saturday, and received the notice of the robbery on the Sunday.

            . The prisoner called at our house at the corner of Paddington-street, on the 1st of January, and paid this 5 l. note to me - I marked it.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house on the 1st of January - I searched him, and found four sovereigns and some silver.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Scotland with my master, and had taken 27 l. I had received this 5 l. note in Scotland, and changed it with a coachman who was going to the North.

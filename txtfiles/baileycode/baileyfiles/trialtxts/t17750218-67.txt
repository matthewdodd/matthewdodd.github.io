            , I am a warehouse man, in Cateaton Street. The prisoner came to me on the 13th of January last with several notes, drawn upon me by a correspondent of mine. He shewed me one for twenty pounds, made payable to Charles Hall or order: it was not indorsed. I had a suspicion of him. I asked him, if his name was Hall? He said, yes. The notes were drawn by 
               
                  John
                   Break
               



            , and

            . He asked me to give him some money on them. I told him, I could not: I had no advice from Mr. Break. He said, he knew I could not, because he was just come from Mr. Break. He said, he would come on Monday, and perhaps, when the post came in I should hear of it. When the post came in, I received a letter with this two hundred pounds note in it. I went to the Bank with it, and found it was a note that had been stolen from Mr. Eaton. I got a constable, and secured the prisoner when he came on Monday about four o'clock, and took him before Sir

             brought me a bank note of two hundred pounds, which he said, belonged to a gentleman at his house, and wanted me to give him cash and small notes for it. I asked how much cash he wanted. He said, he would fetch the gentleman in a few minutes; he left the note with me, and fetched the prisoner. I asked the prisoner if the note belonged to him. He said, it did, and wished I would change it for cash and bank notes. I asked, how much cash he wanted? He said, fifty or a hundred pounds. I said, I could not do that, but if he could take draughts, I would see if I could do it. I asked if he was going out of town directly: He said, no, he was going to dinner. I told him, I would see what I could do after dinner. He called in the afternoon, and I gave him thirty guineas in cash, and a hundred and sixty-eight pounds in notes, drawn on Mr.

                   Yathart
               



            , in Cateaton Street, made payable to Charles Hall, or order; he said, that was his name. I am certain this is the same note I had at first of Wilson: then I gave it the prisoner into his hand. He said, it was his, and gave it me again, and I paid him the change. I kept it two days, then I enclosed it in a letter to Mr. Yethart, and advised him of the notes. ( Yathart produces the letter and drafts.) The letter and drafts are my writing. I delivered the drafts to the prisoner, and he put them in his pocket books. (The letter was read.
Prisoner's defence.
I received the note at Crediton, in Devonshire. I know nothing of the stealing of it.




               Guilty of stealing the notes, but not Guilty of stealing them privately from the person

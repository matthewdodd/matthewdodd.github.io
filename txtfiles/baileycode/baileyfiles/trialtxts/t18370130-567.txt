SARAH WIGGS
. I am the daughter of Francis Wiggs. I lost this Property from the shelf behind the counter—I did not see who took it, but,

a little boy came in and told me—I knew the prisoners, and I ran after them, and took the things away from them—I did not see them near the place—one had the shirts and handkerchief, the other the handkerchief and shoes.





RICHARD HARDING
. I am a police-constable. I was passing down the East India-road on the 11th of January, and saw the prisoners standing in a passage—a boy called out, "There is a robbery"—I turned back, and the prosecutrix called, "Police"—I went and took the prisoners—Currie had a bundle, and so had the other.





HENRY HOULTON
. I am a police-sergeant. I searched the prisoners on the 11th of January—Warner had this handkerchief concealed under his waistcoat.





JOHN KERRY
. I saw Currie stand against Mr. Clarkson's, the cornchandler's, which is two or three doors from Mr. Wiggs—I saw Warner come out with a lot of things under his arm—I saw them walk down Poplar-street—Currie received some things, and tied them up in a handkerchief—I ran and told Miss. Wiggs—she told me to run after them—I ran and called the policeman, and then Miss. Wiggs called "Police," and he took them—Currie was ten or eleven yards from the door.

CURRIE—


NOT GUILTY

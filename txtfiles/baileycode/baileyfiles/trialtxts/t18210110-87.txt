            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in High Holborn


. On the 11th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, this woman and her two sons came in and asked me to buy some matches. I said several times I wanted none. Not suspecting them, I went to my board and kept cutting out leather - they being in the shop. They left in about three minutes. I went to the window, and found the shoes in a confused state. I missed two odd shoes from the first window, and a pair from the other. I went after them, and about five houses down Drury-lane the mother stood on the step of a door buttoning a pair of shoes under the youngest's (Jeremiah) jacket. The largest boy ran away. I took the mother and little one into a butcher's shop, opened his jacket, and took a pair of shoes out.

            . I am a watchman. I found the prisoner, William, at his lodgings, No. 8, Church-lane, St. Giles's, in bed, and found the two odd shoes in his hat, under his bed. When I asked him for them, he said he never had them - the landlord said he brought the shoes in - he then said they were under the bed.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

The prisoner in his defence said, he met with an acquaintance who told him, that the bailiffs were after him, and he asked the prisoner to help to move off his goods; that the prisoner consenting so to do, he took him to this house; that the man took out a bunch of keys and opened the parlour door and the drawers, and he bundled up some of the things; that when the people of the house were alarmed, and laid hold of him, the other man made his escape.
He called his father and another witness, who gave him a good character.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house, but guilty of stealing the goods
            .

                     Thomas 
                     Boheme

                  Thomas 
                  Boheme 
               



            . The prisoner at the bar came to my compting-house on the 14th of September, and produced a letter of attorney, and demanded the prize-money due to one 
               
                  John 
                  Harr 
               



            , 6 l. 10 s. I let him have the money; he said he had other business to do for the said Harr; so took the letter of attorney away with him. After that he came and demanded six more mens money. This 
               
                  John 
                  Harr 
               



             belongs to the Ruby galley; I was manager of her, and paid the prize-money to the men. 
               
                  John 
                  Harr 
               



             afterwards came and demanded the money; I told him I had paid it by virtue of a letter of attorney; he said he never gave any body one; after that, by good accident, my clerk found out the prisoner; he confessed he had received the money in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Lee 
               



            , by power of a letter of attorney, and that he had destroy'd it; he offer'd to make a discovery against a woman that went for his wife; the woman did appear, and produc'd a certificate of her marriage.


                  John 
                  Harr 
               



            . To my knowledge I never saw the prisoner 'till I saw him here at the bar; I was quarter-master on board the Ruby galley, a letter of marque; I was entitled to 6 l. 10 s. prize-money, which was in the hands of Mr Boheme.
Q. Did you ever give a letter of attorney to the prisoner, for him to receive this money?
Harr. No, never; I never in my life made but one, and that was to my mother.


                  Thomas 
                  Skelton 
               



            . I am clerk to Mr Boheme; I have seen the prisoner several times at our compting-house; he came to receive money, and produc'd different powers of attorney; he came once on the 14th of September, under pretence to receive prize-money for Mr Harr. I paid it him, which was 6 l. 10 s. Mr Boheme was present.
Q. Was 
               
                  Frederick 
                  Commerell 
               



             concerned with Mr Boheme in that ship?
Skelton. He was.
Q. Did he produce a letter of attorney sign'd 
               
                  John 
                  Harr 
               



            ?

Skelton. He did.
Court. If it was a good one, no doubt but he will now produce it;
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

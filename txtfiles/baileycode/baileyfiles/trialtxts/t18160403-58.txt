DANIEL NOTTAGE. In consequence of some information which a lady gave me, about six o'clock in the evening of the 4th of March, I went out, and she pointed out the prisoner to me, who had these handkerchiefs in her possession when she was searched by the officer for whom we sent. The handkerchiefs had been hanging by the door.

JOHN WELLESLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of Feb., 2 dead pigeons, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



William Hawes; and, that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAMS HAWES
. I am a poulterer, living in Paddington-street. I had

two pigeons in the shop window at five o'clock in the evening of the 7th of Feb.—I missed them when the policeman came about half-past five, and saw them on the pavement, about four or five doors from my house—an officer picked them up—they were mine.





WILLIAM ROSS
 (police-constable D 157.) I was on duty in Paddington-street, and saw the prisoner walk by the shop two or three times—he snatched the pigeons, put them under his smock, and ran away—I ran, and he dropped them—I took him, and brought him back to the shop—a brother officer picked them up, and they were shown to the prosecutor.





THOMAS COWAN
 (police-constable D 206.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person—I was present at his trial.




GUILTY
. * Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

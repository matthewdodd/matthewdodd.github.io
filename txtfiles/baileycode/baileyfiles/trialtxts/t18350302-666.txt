WILLIAM CROFT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of January, 1 pistol, value 4s., the goods of 



Edward Pearson, and that he had been before convicted of felony.







EDWARD PEARSON
. My father keeps a broker's shop in York-street, Westminster. This pistol was on the table in the shop—I missed it on Friday, the 16th of January—I do not know the prisoner.





HENRY GIBSON
. I am shopman to Mr. Jones, of Tothill-street. I received this pistol in pawn on the 16th of January, from a woman, in the name of Harris.





MARY HOWE
. I am married, and live in Pye-street. I have known the prisoner two or three years—I pawned this pistol at Jones's shop—the prisoner sent it up to me—I refused to pawn it—he then came and told me it was all right, and asked me to pawn it for him over the water, but I pawned it in York-street, for 2s.

Prisoner. Another young man came into the room at the same time, and asked her to pawn it, and gave her 6d. Witness. No—I received nothing for it—I gave the prisoner the money—there was nobody but him in my room—he told me a young man had left it with his landlady for rent, and his landlady asked him to pawn or sell it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





ROBERT GOOSE
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from the Clerk of the Peace at Clerkenwell (read)—I was a witness on his trial—he is the person who was convicted with a person named Dobson.

Prisoner's Defence. A young man asked me to pawn the pistol for him, and I asked her to pawn it.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

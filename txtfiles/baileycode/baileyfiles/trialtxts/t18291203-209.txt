            . I am a Police-constable. I saw the prisoner in Charlton-street - I thought she looked rather bulky; I took her in a chessemonger's shop - I found one pot under her arm, one in her pocket, and one under her petticoat; one belongs to a Mr. Squires, but he is ill, and is not here.

            . This pot is his.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work over the water; I had been to several houses in the street, and I went into this shop - I did not see the officer; he came in, pulled me about, and took things from me - I had no pot about me; I had been out as a nurse, and went to ask the shop-keeper for Mr. Jamieson.

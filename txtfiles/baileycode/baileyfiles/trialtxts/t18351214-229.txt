KENNET KINGSFORD
. On the 1st of December I was passing through Little East-Cheap, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and felt some one at my pocket—I put my hand behind me, and fastened it on the wrist of the prisoner—I said, "You rascal, you have stolen my handkerchief"—he said, "I have not got it"—I did not see the handkerchief at that moment—I said, "I shall take you to the station-house"—a solider came up, and then saw the handkerchief.





JAMES EASTMAN
. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket and throw it behind him.





FRANCIS M'LEAN
. I was in the station-house—a person informed me a gentleman had got a lad in custody—I ran out and found the prosecutor with the prisoner—I found nothing on him—this is the handkerchief that was given to me.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

ROBERT JAMES JACKSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 4 pairs of shoes, value 14s. 6d., the goods of 



William Green, his master; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM GREEN
. I am a ladies' shoemaker; the prisoner was in my employ. On the 17th of Sept. I left him alone while I was absent eight or ten minutes—on my return he was gone—I missed four pairs of shoes—they have never been found—the prisoner was in the place where they had been—I went after him, and found him at his mother's—I said, "There you are"—he made his escape out of the window.





JOB SALMON SMITH
 (police-Constable G 44.) I took the prisoner—he said he saw the shoes on the line, but he did not take them—he told me

that he jumped out of the window, and when he saw me he said he did not know it was me, or he would not have come.





WILLIAM RENSHETT
 (police-sergeant G 26.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 31st Jan., 1842, (having been before convicted of felony,) and confined one year)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

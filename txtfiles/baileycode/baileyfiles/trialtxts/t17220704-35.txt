 in Leaden Hall Market, and was commonly employ'd by the Prosecutor; the prisoner having been seen to sell Suet at Tallow Chandler's gave the Prosecutor a suspicion of her, whereupon he privately Stuck some ends of Scewers in the Suet and desired the Tallow Chandler when the prisoner came again, to cut the Suet open, and if he found the Scewers in it to stop the prisoner, and send for him; the prisoner was accordingly detected. The Suet and Scewers was produc'd in Court, and the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d
            .

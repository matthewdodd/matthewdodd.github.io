            . I am carman to Thomas Haines, who has a partner - they live in Watling-street


. On the 10th of January, about half-past seven o'clock, I left the cart at the door for about two minutes - there were two 14 lbs. parcels of tapioca in it; as I returned I saw the prisoner take one out of the cart, and seized him going away with it - he begged hard to be let go, and said he was not the man - I gave him in charge.

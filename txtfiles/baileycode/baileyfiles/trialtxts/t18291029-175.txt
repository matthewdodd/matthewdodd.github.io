, and lives near me; Page gave me information - I looked towards the end of the street, and saw Butcher with something under his apron, walking quick; I ran round the houses, and came nearly to him - he threw down this ham, and ran off; I called Stop thief! and he was stopped within three or four yards of me - I did not see Perkins.

            . I am an errand-boy. I saw Perkins take the ham from Mason's shop - he gave it to Butcher, who ran off with it; Perkins ran in the same direction, and then turned back - I followed, and he was taken in my sight.

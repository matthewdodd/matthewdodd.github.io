GEORGE SPINKS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of May, 1 cask, value 6s., the goods of 



John Whale.






MARY WHALE
. I live in Thompson's buildings, Red-cross-street, Borough. My husband's name is John—we missed a cask on Saturday evening last—I think this is it—it was in the yard, full of water.

Prisoner. As I was coming from my work, I saw it he—I took it home, and was going to find the owner.





ROBERT PEARMAN
 (police-constable M 184.) On Saturday morning last, between one and two o'clock, I was on duty in Mint-street, and saw the prisoner trying to get into a lodging-house—they refused him, he having this cask in his possession—I went to see what it was—he said he brought it from Greenwich, that his brother gave it him, and it was new, but I found it an old cask, and it was wet inside, as if recently emptied.

Prisoner. I went across to the policeman, and said, "Here is a cask I picked up, will you take care of it"—he looked at it with his bull's eye, and then told me to go to the station-house.





ROBERT PEARMAN
. No, quite the contrary—I went across to him, and I had no bull's eye—I never carry one.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

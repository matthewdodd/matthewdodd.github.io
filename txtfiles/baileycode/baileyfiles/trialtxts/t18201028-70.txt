                  , from his person

JAMES TAYLOR. On the 18th of October I was in St. James's-street, Westminster


, at one o'clock, standing at a jeweller's shop-window; in about three seconds the prisoner Bray came in the rear of my left shoulder, I immediately felt his hand in my outside coat pocket. I felt and missed my handkerchief - I saw it in his hand, collared him, and saw him put his hand behind and give it to Toms, whom I also seized. Two officers came up and took them.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners attempt several persons' pockets, in St. James's-street. I saw Bray put his hand into Mr. Taylor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out. I secured them both.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

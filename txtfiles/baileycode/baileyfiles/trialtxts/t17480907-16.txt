                  Burrass 
               



             . On the 24th of August last I lost my handkerchief out of my pocket, in Bartholomew-fair


.
Q. Do you know who took it?
Burrass. 
               
                  John 
                  Swanney 
               



             took it; because I saw him run down Chick-lane with it in his hand . I followed him, and I found him at an alehouse-door , and he call'd Mr. Fish, who was with me, an impudent dog. He at first denied that he took it, but afterwards owned it, and that he had sold the handkerchief; and offered me the money he had sold it for: he said he had sold it for 7 d. half-penny, and I might take the money, if I would.
Prisoner. Did you see me take the handkerchief out of your pocket ?
Burrass. There was no body by me but you, and you had the handkerchief in your hand.

                  Fish 
               



            . Mr. Burrass and I were at the fair, eating some curds and whey, and Swanney stood by me and the prosecutor; and Mr. Burrass put his hand in his pocket, and said he had lost his handkerchief. I said there was no body but the prisoner by.
Q. Did you see any handkerchiefs in his hand?
Fish . No: we went down Chick-lane, and he was at an alehouse-door. I asked him for the handkerchief , and he called me an impudent dog, and gave me a punch in the face, and set me a-bleeding. He owned he took the handkerchief, and had sold it for 7 d. halfpenny; but he did not say where; and offered the prosecutor the 7 d. halfpenny.

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. I have been inform'd, by one who has serv'd the office of constable, that the prisoner is a very old offender; and I took hold of him, and secur'd him.




               Guilty, 10 d.

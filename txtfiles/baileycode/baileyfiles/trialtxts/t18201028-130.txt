            . On the 27th of October I missed these iron bars from the kitchen window, in front of a house which we had bought - they were fixed to the window-frame. I allowed poor people to inhabit the house till it was pulled down.

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop in Church-lane, Strand; some boys passed - somebody came in and said they suspected them, I followed them, they all ran away except the prisoner, who went into No. 4, Church-lane, with this grating. It is an old-iron shop. I took him with it, I fitted it to the house.

            . I keep a collar-maker's shop
 in Liquorpond-street


. I had given the prisoner leave to be in my house about last Easter; but she had left it three months ago. One Saturday night last after I was gone to bed, my daughter and sister, who lay together, came down from their bed-room, and told me my drawers were stripped. I got up, and we got 
               
                  Richard 
                  Bennet 
               



             and another person to search about, and in a garret the prisoner was found concealed under a bed, and the things mentioned in the indictment were bundled up in a table-cloth by her, which were taken out of the drawers. She said, there was a man with her, who had taken the things from their places, and had bundled them up. We searched all about, but could find no man in the House.

            . I am daughter to Mrs. Gibson. I went to look for my night-cap, and found the drawers were stripped. My aunt Young was with me; we thought we heard a noise. We went to my mother, and then called in a neighbour or two [the rest as the former witness].

The prisoner in her defence said, It is all right.

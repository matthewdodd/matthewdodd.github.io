            . I live at the Thistle and Crown, Charing Cross


; I have a club at my house every Wednesday Evening, of tradesmen, gentlemen's Servants, and others. On the 3d of Nov. the Prisoner came, he not having money borrowed six pence of 
               
                  David 
                  Bayly 
               



            , and as they were altogether in the room, my wife had occasion to go up to a pair of chest of drawers, which were close to the prisoners back, to open a drawer to change a guinea, she took out silver and put in a guinea; he took so much notice of it, as to say to the company, let us be merry, here's money enough, putting back his elbow to the drawers; as he was late there, he desired 
               
                  David 
                  Bayly 
               



             to get leave for him to lie there all night, at my house, so he and David Bayly lay together, the next day they came down together, and called for some bread and cheese and a pint of beer. I happened to have a 36 s. piece, and 4 s. we had been counting the money to pay the brewer, my wife went with this money to the drawer for the rest; upon her saying so, the prisoner said, he must go up to the Hay-market, he left his bread and cheese and went away; my wife returned and said, that the drawers had been opened and the money was gone, he had taken coach at Charing Cross, and went up to Monmouth Street, and bought a good suit of cloaths. We took him at a night house in Covent Garden, I lost 9 l. 10 s. and a spanish dollar, in searching him the Spanish dollar was taken out of his pocket; by the beadle; this dollar was put with the money in the drawers, there was a bill in his pocket, of the place where he had bought the cloaths. We went to that house, and the salesman told me there had been such a man, who had bought such a suit, and had left his old cloaths with him which was there produced.

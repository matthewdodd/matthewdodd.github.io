; his wife being big, he had provided the things mentioned against her lying in. He went to see his mother in law in Church Lane, St. Giles's

When he returned the bundle was missing. The prisoner lived in the same house; she was taken up. She confess'd she stole the things and sold them for three shillings, except the paper of pins, which she gave to the prosecutor again, and which were produced in court.

WILLIAM ASH, alias
 Peter Rogers

, was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of December, 1 pair of boots, value 2s., the goods of 




John Thomson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ISABELLA THOMPSON
. I live with my father, John Thompson, a boot-maker, in Tottenham-court-road. On the afternoon of the 14th of Dec. I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner lurking about for five minutes, then he came back, caught hold of a pair of boots, snatched them down, and ran across the road, up Tavistock-street, and was stopped.





CHARLES AUGUSTUS FROST
. I heard the witness call, and saw the prisoner, only one step from the door, with a pair of boots—I saw him stopped, and one boot taken out of his breast—it is here—I know it to be the same.





JAMES BLOOM
 (police-constable E 98.) I found the prisoner in Caroline-street

—a man holding him said he had got away from another man—the prisoner said, "Yes, and you could not have taken me had you been alone"—I took him into custody, and in crossing the street, he said, if I did not mind he would black my shins for me.





JOHN EATON
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—he is the person described in the certificate.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

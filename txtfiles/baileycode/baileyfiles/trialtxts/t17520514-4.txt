            . I can only prove the ham is my property, by a mark made on the outside of it, I suppose done by the nuckle of another in the carriage. (Produced in court.)

            . I keep a pork-shop in Honey-lane Market. On the 28th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, having shut up my shop, and going for a pint of beer, I saw the prisoner standing near the prosecutor's shop; presently I saw him take a ham from off a bulk at his shop, he ran up Honey-lane Market, and I after him calling out stop thief! the other two witnesses, 
               
                  George 
                  Monday 
               



             and 
               
                  Thomas

            , stopped him, and can give a farther account.

            . I had shut up my master's shop that night betwixt nine and ten o'clock, and standing at the door, 
               
                  Mary 
                  White 
               



             called out, stop thief! I saw the prisoner coming along with a ham in his hand; I pursued him, and saw him sling it under a butcher's stall: I took him directly, and another man took up the ham: I know this is the same by the mark made in it, &c.


                  Thomas 
                  Hudson 
               



            . I saw the prisoner fling down the ham, and the last witness take hold on him: I went and took the ham, and delivered it to the prosecutor's servant : I think this is the same ham, but don't swear to it.


                  Edward

            . I am constable. On the 28th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner: at that time the ham was put into my custody, and have had it ever since: I made a cross upon it, which is now to be seen.
Prisoner's defence.
I had not the ham, I was coming home orderly as another poor man might.

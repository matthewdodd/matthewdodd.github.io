            . I am servant to Mr. Mabberly of Paul's Wharf; we deal with the prosecutor. On the 25th of March I paid the prisoner a banker's draft for 2 l., on Messrs. Masterman, and produce the receipt he gave me - (read) - sometime after the prosecutor called for it.

             re-examined. He never gave me the draft, nor accounted to me for it. I particularly questioned him about it, and he said he had not received it.

Prisoner's Defence. My master stopped my last week's wages. I thought that was for part of it.

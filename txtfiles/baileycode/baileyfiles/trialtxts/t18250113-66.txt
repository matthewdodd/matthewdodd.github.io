JOHN JACKSON. I live in High-street. Shadwell


. On the 10th of December I lost an umbrella from a rail inside the shop - I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour before: I was in a back parlour when it was taken. I saw it again in about ten minutes, when the prisoner was brought back with it. I had seen him repeatedly, with other boys, in the neighbourhood.

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I saw the prisoner and two other boys near Mr. Jackson's shop - the prisoner went in, took the umbrella, and ran off with it: I pursued, and took him with it in his hand. I brought him back to Mr. Jackson's shop, who claimed it.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 22d of September I was in Seymour-place, Camden-town


, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I saw the two prisoners go into West's shop; Pine came out with this brush; I went into the shop, and found Tomlin with his hand in a tub - these two brushes were by him; I asked what they were doing there; Pine said he was looking for a place, and then said he came to buy a brush.
CHARLES WILLIAM HASTINGS STRATFORD WEST. I was out at the time, but know these brushes to be mine - I know nothing of the prisoners.

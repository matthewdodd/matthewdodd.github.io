On the 29th of October last I was going from Queen-street to Long-acre, I saw a man at Mr. Lucas's shop window, and then I saw him standing in the shop, and I saw him come out of the shop with something under his arm, I followed him into Great Queen-street, and laid hold of him at the end of Wild-street, and asked him if that was his property, he had a plate warmor under his arm, he said it was his own; I took him back to the shop, he said, Sir, do not make a noise, I will go back with you; he behaved very well.

Prisoner. I shall not presume to trouble the Court with a defence after this evidence, but I trust in your Lordship; I did not know that my trial would come on, though there are many respectable people in the Court I believe that know me.

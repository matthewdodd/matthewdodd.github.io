            . I am a coal-merchant
, and live in Millman-street, Bedford-row. On the 9th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was crossing from the end of Fleet-market


, and felt something touch my pocket - I immediately missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw the prisoner going very quick from me, and concealing something in his bosom. I pursued, calling out Stop thief, and saw him throw the handkerchief down; he was stopped in the middle of the road - I never lost sight of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

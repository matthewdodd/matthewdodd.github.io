. On the 24thof October I went to the National School rooms in St. George's in the East



, having understood that Colonel Stanhope would make a declaration of his political sentiments - while I was there, Tool asked me if I had lost any thing; I felt, and missed my handkerchief - I asked him if he could point out the thief; we went round, and found the prisoner in the crowd - I took him by the collar, and accused him of having taken my handkerchief; he denied it, but I took off his hat, and found my own handkerchief and another in it, and an old one which I believe to be his own - this is mine.

                  John
                   Greenfield
               



            . On Saturday the 15th of December last, I locked up the house and took up the key: in the morning the maid came up to me and told me somebody had been in my house; I went down into the shop, there I saw the goods in the back compting-house; the holland and table linen were brought forward and laid at the end of the compter. There is nothing to be seen of a night; the shutters all shut up, and the compter locks, so that nothing is to be seen. There was one bundle of Irish in a wrapper, tied up like an handkerchief, laid close by the street door; the street door was pulled to; the goods that lay on the compter were brought out of the back compting-house, which had been broke open; a pannel was taken out, and the box of the lock was unscrewed and taken off. The holland, the muslin, the damask table linen, and the cambrick, were taken out of the compting-house. In the shop there were two locks off, and the side shutters broke; one on the right side, the other on the left: some printed furniture cottons were taken out of one side, and some callico wrappers on the other side, and two compters were broke open: the compter slaps stood up edge-ways: there were printed lawns, figured and corded dimities, silks, and silk burdets; silk and cotton handkerchiefs, silk handkerchiefs, and I think some checks; there were several sprigged muslins and figured lawns and nankeen cloth: the street door was pulled to, the chain taken off, and the lock unscrewed. Some bundles of Irish lay at the street door, and some muslin neckcloths: the irish was removed out of the compting-house, that was all that was left of about fifty pieces; there were about eight or nine pieces; the neckcloths came out of the compters in the first shop. There was a piece of wax candle burning upon a pile of sheeting in the compting-house; it was in a flat candlestick, and a candle in it alight that had been taken out of the kitchen, up two pair of stairs.
Q. Do you know any thing of the candle?
Greenfield. I do not.
Q. What size was it?
Greenfield. Rather bigger than a long six; there was about one part out of three left. I found the matches lay in a window of the bed-room up one pair of stairs in the back room. The window they got in at was nailed up quite round; that window looks into Mitre-Court. A pain of glass was taken out of a closet window, but there were iron bars and they could not get in; there were inside shutters to that window, which were pinned with iron pins over night; they were bursted open.
Q. Did you lock the street door yourself?
Greenfield. No; 
               
                  Dorothy
                   Johnson
               



             did: I had the key.
Q. Did you lose any muslin?
Greenfield. Upwards of 500 l. worth.
(The articles in the indictment repeated to him.)
Q. Did you lose these several articles?
Greenfield. Yes.
Q. To what amount?
Greenfield. To the best estimate I can make, my stock was worth, before I was robb'd, 2500 l. I cast up my stock after the robbery, and it only amounted to 1116 l. the first thing I did I sent for some gentlemen in the city; we went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's directly: we had bills printed to send to pawnbrokers and coachmen. Next morning, I offered a reward of 20 l. and Five per cent. Afterwards people censured me, and said I robbed myself, because I offered so small a reward: then I offered Twenty per cent. and got the king's pardon; that did nothing. Mr. Stratford's robbery was a month after, and then they were taken up: Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's men came to let me know they had taken the prisoners; they brought 
               
                  Sarah
                   Dunster
               



             first in a coach with a bundle of goods to my door, almost five weeks after this. I was at the coffee-house when Mr. Fielding's man came and told me he had a woman with some of my goods; I opened the bundle, and saw they were my property. There were some flower'd dimity, twelve fine damask napkins: she brought one piece of diaper napkin very fine, one large damask table-cloth, two ditto, three remnants of flower'd dimity, one remnant of quilting, one of corded dimity, and two remnants of irish, that she had in her apron; they had my marks on them: the napkins generally come by setts, a table cloth and twelve napkins together. We put the same marks on them. I think they are marked I | U, but the marks are my own hand writing. I went to old Siday's house, Shoe Lane, which she had shewn Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's men. The goods were up stairs in trunks and chests; and the old woman was washing in the back room, when I went in, some damask table cloths of mine cut across, and some callicoe wrappers and muslin neck-cloths: she said a person had brought them in the night, and desired her to wash them.
Q. Did she continue washing these things after the men were at her house?
Greenfield. Yes; I understood so. I went up stairs and the men shewed me some of the rest of the goods in trunks, chests, and the like: I found, up one pair of stairs I think, three pieces of book muslin, two hundred and seventy-three yards; seventy yards of muslin for neckcloths, two hundred and five yards irish, thirty yards irish, eight yards worked muslin for aprons, two yards scotch cambrick, one hundred yards printed linen, sixty-one yards silk and cotton cloth, gold printed; fifteen yards of dimity.
Q. Is that woman Siday's mother?
Greenfield. Yes; the goods are all here now, I have looked them all over; they have almost all my own marks, in my own hand writing.
Q. Are you able to swear, the goods, or any part of them, found in this woman's apartment, were those you was robbed of?
Greenfield. Yes.
Q. Did the woman say the things up stairs were brought to wash as she said of the others?
Greenfield. I don't know she said any thing particular of them.

                   Johnson
               



            . I lived servant with Mr. Greenfield: the house was robbed on Sunday before Christmas-day: I locked the door over night; the window up two pair of stairs was fastened over night: I locked the door and carried the key up to my master's room, and all was safe: I came down next morning about eight; I found the one pair of stairs chamber door open; the window was open: I went up and called my master; I came down along with him; a pane of glass was taken out and the shutter forced open; there was a bundle of cloth lay near the door, and the street door was open; the lock was screwed off: I got up at half an hour after six, and came down at eight.
Q. Could any body go out without taking the lock off?
Johnson. No; there was a wax candle alight upon a box and upon some wrappers, I think callico wrappers; it was in a flat candlestick which had been taken out of the two pair of stairs room: the candle was not ours; there might be about half of it burnt; my master searched and missed his things.
Cross Examination.
Q. It was light when you came down?
Johnson. Yes.

                   Taylor
               



            . On the sixteenth of January in the evening, an information was brought to Mr. Bond, clerk to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , of Mr. Stratford's robbery which led to a discovery: we went to the house of 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



            ; we went into the one pair of stairs room with the son: Siday got out of bed and got under it in order to secret himself; we found Siday's wife there: the street door was upon the latch: we went up and they opened the door.
Q. Were they in bed?
Taylor. Yes, I believe they were all together; Siday had his breeches and stockings on but nothing else: these goods were locked up: Siday gave me the key to open the drawers they were in (the goods produced) fourteen yards of holland, nine yards of irish, a remnant of sprig muslin, two yards; and eight neck-cloths; they were washed but had never been worn.
Q. from Siday. Can you swear to them?
Greenfield. They have been washed, but I lost of them
Q. to Prosecutor. What are marked?
Greenfield. The spring muslin is marked O | U. the holland I | U. the irish are cut into shifts; there are no marks to them; seven handkerchiefs are cut separate without any marks.
Q. to Taylor. How long did you stay in this room?
Taylor. About half an hour.
Q. What did they say?
Taylor. Mrs. Siday said, it was linen she bought; in opening another drawer, where there were some pistols, &c. we found this ticket (producing it.)
Mr. Greenfield. This was a ticket upon a piece of scotch holland sheeting, takes out of the compting-house.
Taylor. I found a bullet mould, a brace of balls, and two powder horns; the pistols were found in a drawer of a chest of drawers; the ticket was found in the same place; Siday opened most of them himself, except the bottom drawer, where the pistols were: Burch was not taken till the Saturday se'nnight following; we had information where he lodged, in Plough Court, Gray's-Inn Lane: we went up stairs and enquired of Mrs. Burch for her husband; she said he was gone out of town; in about half an hour, or three quarters of an hour he came in; we found a vast quantity of goods there (producing them.)
Prosecutor. Here are two diaper table cloths marked, three damask cloths with my mark, a fine diaper piece of cloth with my mark, one piece of gulix holland with my mark. It will be almost impossible to find the marks of them all, they are in different places: I have looked them all over, most are marked; here is a whole piece of muslin with the mark upon it.
Q. You mentioned there was a piece of fine diaper cloth, part of which were found at Dunster's?
Greenfield. Yes.
Q. Is there any part of them, that are parts of a set found in any other people's custody?
Greenfield. I don't know that there is; there were but two sets of diaper, the other set was in Siday's possession.
Q. to Taylor. Where did you find these goods?
Taylor. All in Burch's room; these two boxes were full, the rest were laying about.
Prosecutor. That Siday was married the morning they were took.
Taylor. We went to old Mrs. Siday's house on the seventeenth of January, about nine in the morning; her house is in Shoe Lane; Mr. Bond and I went together, she was washing; we asked for Mr. Siday; she said he was out; we told her we were informed there were some of Mr. Greenfield's goods in her house; she said, she knew nothing about it. We found these three bags of goods there (producing them). Mr. Greenfield looked at the things; she was washing, and said they were his.
Q. to Taylor. Can you tell what quantity of things were found at Mr. Siday's?
Taylor. A large quantity, more dry than wet; some were found in the two pair, some in the three pair of stairs; there were some in chests, some tied up in other things. One Jennings and his wife lodged there at that time, but not in the room in which we found these things: we told her they were Mr. Greenfield's things; she said, they were left there by a person. We staid there about two hours, then we took Siday and the things to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's
Mr. Greenfield. Here are seven pieces of Irish all my mark on them that were found at old Siday's; here is the piece of holland sheeting that ticket belonged to; most of them have my marks upon them; there is a mark upon the table-cloth that was cut in two which she was washing.


                  Nicholas
                   Bond
               



            . I went on Wednesday in the last sessions week: I was in court about seven; I was sent for out by a man who said a Jew had offered him a diamond ring; I went to the Jew, took him to Sir John, he gave information that he had it of Cannon and Siday: I went with him to Siday's lodgings in Seacoal Lane; he went up stairs to their room softly; I went up with him; at the second knock they opened the door; Cannon stood in his shirt; I saw the other go out of the bed, and get under it; I sprang upon Cannon, and secured him, and called to them that were with me, and they secured Siday: I found these things upon a second search in the bottom drawer of a chest of drawers: I did not perceive that drawer at the first search (produces five loaded pistols, are iron crow, several chissels, and also an iron key.)
Q. Do you know Siday's business?
Bond. I believe, a printer. Cannon's a gentleman's servant: we took them to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and after he had committed them, the Jew sent for me, and told me he had forgot to tell me he had bought two handkerchiefs of 
               
                  George
                   Burch
               



            : I went with him, nobody answered we broke the door open; this was two doors from Siday's in Seacoal Lane; we found nothing. Next morning, coming through Bartholomew's Hospital into Smithfield, I met a woman; I thought I knew her; she had a bundle in her apron; I thought they were Mr. Greenfield's goods: that is 
               
                  Sarah
                   Dunster
               



            : she had some muslins and things in her apron: she told me she had the things at Mr. Siday's, who keeps a pork shop in Shoe Lane: I left her in custody while I went to Siday's; we found several handkerchiefs in the bureau in the shop: I went up stairs; in the top pair of stairs the garret door was lock'd: I look'd thro' a vacancy in the door, and saw two or three doors lock'd: I went down and ask'd for the key; she said she had not got it; we broke the door open, and found the three bags of linen, &c. now produced. On the 25th I had an information where Burch's father lived; I went; it was at the Greyhound in Grub-street; I had intelligence of his rooms; I opened the door, found nothing in the rooms; we waited till the father came home, and then took him to Sir John: he said, rather than be committed he would tell where his son was: he took us to a court in Gray's Inn Lane; he asked where his son was; we opened the door. Under the head of the bed, upon the sacking, were several parcels of linen, and the tools I have here were in this box; (producing three pistols, some saws, and chissels.) The box stood upon the window lock'd; we waited about half an hour, and then Jane Burch came in with a leg of mutton: we waited about an hour and a half, and Birch came in with a man in company with him; Whitworth, a printer.
Cross Examination.
Q. Dunster said she had these things from Burch?
Bond. Yes.
Q. That you found by being there the night before to be a falsity?
Bond. Yes; and then she directed me to Siday's lodgings.

            . Mr. Noakes stopp'd me one day by Bartholomew's Hospital: I know all the prisoners but old Mrs. Sidey; I never saw her till in New Prison. I was in bed in my lodgings in Little Britain the morning I was took: about seven o'clock old Siday came and called his son, 
               
                  William
                   Siday
               



            , to get up; he was in bed with me. He asked him why he should get up. He ask'd me to get up, and go to his house; he said, You, Sal, are pretty strong to take a b undle. I ask'd what bundle I was to carry: he said, I was to go to his house, and ask for a bundle of table linen that was marked; which was given to me by a woman outside the door, a middle-aged woman. I was to leave the bundle at my lodgings for old Mr. Siday and young Mr. Siday. As I was going along with it Mr. Noakes stopp'd me; I was frightened: I told them I would tell them where I had the linen from: I took them to Siday's.
Q. How came you to say you had it from Burch's?
Dunster. Mrs. Burch had been to me to desire me to carry a bundle the same morning, but I refused it: she was concerned in the robbery. I gave Mr. Noakes and Mr. 
               
                  Bond
               


             an information where I had the linen from: I was in

            , his wife and one woman, whose son was hanged: her name is Burd.
Q. Be particular what the conversation was?
Dunster. They were advertised about Mr. Greenfield's affair. A woman gave Mr. Greenfield intelligence that his house was robbed, but she did not apprehend the thieves. Mrs. Burd said they had been out one day, and pawned ten or seven guineas worth of muslin and aprons, and they were afraid of being took, and said an information was laid against them.
Q. Was it said who was concerned in breaking open the house?
Dunster. 
               
                  Jane
                   Burch
               



            , Siday, and his wife were all concerned in the robbery. Then I went after the first time to Burch's lodgings, next door but one to Siday's: Burch was bundling up a great quantity of muslin; she went for a box, but could not get any: there was a box in the room, which he fill'd full, and his wife wash'd a great quantity of the goods and put them on the lines to dry: he said, they were going away upon Mr. Greenfield's account, for they were afraid of being took.
Q. Did Burch and his wife go away whilst you was in the room?
Dunster. Yes; I came out with them: I lived then in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury. Burch told me, that he and his wife, and 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             and his wife, and 
               
                  William
                   Siday
               



             and his wife, were concerned in the robbery. Mrs. Siday said she carried the largest bundle, she said Burch's wife had concealed some things unknown to her, which she found out and took away from her.
Cross Examination.
Q. The goods were given you out of Mr. Siday's house?
Dunster. Yes; they never came to my lodgings before that time.
Q. And you don't know the woman that gave them to you?
Dunster. No.
Q. How came you to tell Noakes when he stopped you that you had them from Burch?
Dunster. Mrs. Burch came up to that morning.
Q. Why did you tell the officer a falsity?
Dunster. I had no reason for it; I was frightened; I considered 
               
                  George
                   Burch
               



             the instigator of all of it.
Q. It was at old Siday's persuasion you went?
Dunster. Yes; but I thought it was all Burch's contrivance.
Q. Did not they ask you what those goods were, and whose.
Dunster. They said I was the woman they wanted; they asked me where I had them from; I said I did not know: Noakes asked me where Burch lived; I told them where Burch lived, but did not say I had the linen from Burch; I cannot swear to it I was so frightened.
Court. I suppose you would rather have had this fall upon Burch than Siday?
Dunster. No; why should I?
Q. Why, you lived with Siday's son?
Dunster. That is no reason.

            . I am a pawnbroker; I have here a bit of muslin which I gave a duplicate of to

                   Siday
               



             the younger, it is billited in her name; I can't remember the fact: she often sent apparel by a girl; I can't say whether it was from her or the girl; I took it on the eighteenth of December.
Prosecutor. This is sprig-worked, the same pattern as that I lost.
Ferras. I have an apron and three handkerchiefs I took of 
               
                  Jane
                   Burch
               



             on the nineteenth of December; I took them in myself.
Prosecutor. Here is my mark upon this muslin handkerchief.

            . I am a pawnbroker; I took in of 
               
                  Jane
                   Siday
               



             the elder, these things (producing them) they were pledged between the eighteenth of December and fifteenth of January; some holland, some irish, and some lawns, and here is a piece of nankeen. Prosecutor. There is a remnant of holland sheeting about twenty yards, there is a piece of nankeen five yards and a half, four neckcloths, one apron, one black cotton handkerchief, two remnants of cambrick, one remnant of muslin, and three remnants of irish, they are all marked but the neckcloths, which are cut asunder.
Q. Did you know Mrs. Siday?
Jarvis. She had used my shop some time; I knew she kept a pork shop in Shoe Lane.
Court. This is a little suspicious for a woman keeping a pork shop.
Jarvis. I said Mrs. Jennings, for she came to me by that name, this is a large piece of fine holland; she said, her husband had took it for a debt. She had brought me good things, and I had no suspicion of her.
Q. to Dunster again. When was 
               
                  Jane
                   Burch
               



             married?
Dunster. She used to walk the Piazzas, Covent-Garden, she was not married then.
Cannon's Defence.
I was down at Bath at the time the robbery was committed, in Mr. Stratford's service.
Siday's Defence.
On Christmas Eve my brother came to me, and brought me these pieces of linen, and asked me to buy them. I bid him let me look at them. I asked him, What will you have for them? he said, Three guineas: I bid him two; he took the money. Here is a chair-woman that was cleaning out my wife's room, at the same time, saw it; her name is 
               
                  Sarah

            . Whatever he did is unknown to me.
For Cannon.
The Hon. Mr. Stratford.
Q. The prisoner says he was in your service at Bath at the time of this robbery; When did you come from Bath?
Mr. Stratford. The 24th of December he was with me at Bath.
Q. How long has he been in your service?
Mr. Stratford. I should think he must have been there on the 15th.

Q. Had he been with you ten days?
Mr. Stratford. Yes; I believe he had.
Burch's Defence.
What that woman says is false. On Friday the 18th of January, I think, 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             came to my house, and asked me to let him leave a box: that his father and he had fell out, and he was going to take his things from his father's. I said I would. I was fetch'd out. He brought in a coach these two boxes and some bundles with the things in them. A young man was at my house at the same time with my wife, drinking tea; he promised to her he would be there the next day. I never saw him afterwards. I was taken up on the Saturday following. He brought them in when I was out at my lodgings in Gray's Inn Lane. I never had any thing at Seacoal Lane.

            's Defence.
I am very innocent. 
               
                  William
                   Siday
               



             came up with a box; he bid me put the boxes under the bed. I told him my husband would be angry at his leaving so many things there. There was a little pocket book he left on one of the boxes: after he was gone. I put it on one of the shelves; I never opened it.

                   Siday
               



             the elder's defence.
They were my son's things; he used to bring me to wash; my eldest son, William. I know nothing of any other things besides them I was washing. The things I pawn'd my husband gave me, and ordered me to pawn them.
For

                   Farr
               



            . I live in St. Giles's. I used to clean Mrs. Siday's house and wash for her some times; she lived in Seacoal Lane. I cleaned a room at Mrs. Siday's on Christmas eve.
Q. Which Mrs. Sidays?
Farr. The young one.
Q. Do you know 
               
                  William
                   Siday
               



            ?
Farr. Yes; I saw him on Christmas Eve last: When I was cleaning the room he came in with three pieces of cloth. Mr. Siday bought them and gave him two guineas for them, and told him one of the pieces would make some shifting for Mrs. Siday.
Cross Examination.
Q. What time of the day was it?
Farr. About six in the evening.
Q. Where was you then?
Farr. In the room I had just done cleaning.
Q. Had they any more rooms than one?
Farr. There is a little room that has a sink in it, and another little room. I was then in the one pair of stairs room Mrs. Siday lived in.
Q. Who was with her?
Farr. Only Mr. Siday reading a book: there were three pieces, two together, and a large piece rolled up.
Q. Did he say where he had them?
Farr. No; there was not a word about any thing else.
Q. Did 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             make any hesitation whether to buy it or not?
Farr. I did not hear.
Q. You did not attend to the conversation?
Farr. No.

             eleven years. I got him apprentice to Mr. Burd: he has often told me he never had an honester, better lad in his life. Burd failed about a year and a half ago; I have known nothing of Siday since.

Q. Was you at Burch's room when Siday came there?
Price. He asked me to come and see him. I went to his house, a court in Gray's-Inn-Lane; he was not at home. His wife asked me to stay and drink tea. The while I was there Siday brought up a little trunk; then a coachman and Siday brought up two great chests between them. Siday's wife asked whether her husband had given them leave to bring them there: he said, Never mind, your husband won't be angry with you. I went away and saw no more; this was on Saturday, a little better than a week before he was taken up.
Cross Examination.
Q. Had you ever been at Siday's before?

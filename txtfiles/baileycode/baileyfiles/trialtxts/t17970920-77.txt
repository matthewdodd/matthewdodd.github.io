Second Court. Laying it to be the property of persons unknown.(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys.)
- LUCAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a wharfinger; On the 29th of August last, I was on Sab's quay


, between the hours of two and three; I observed the prisoner taking sugar from one of the hogsheads, and apparently putting it into his trowsers; I went up to him, and desired he would return it into the hogshead again; he did not appear disposed to do that, and I said hold of him for the purpose of delivering him in charge of the gangsmen or of the constable; upon attempting to search him for the sugar, he rather hesitated, and a scuffle ensued; my had was knocked off; and in attempting to recover it, he slipped away; I pursued him up one of the avenues into Thames-street, close at his heels; he turned to the right hand; there was a stoppage of carts that stopped his running, and he turned down one of the gateways towards the quays again; in that gateway I overtook him, struck him, and he fell down; he was then taken in charge by the constable and gangsmen, and the property was taken from him by them; he had 2 large bag tied before him, under his apron; there was nothing in that, I believe; the sugar was in his trowsers.
Q. Had you known this man before? - A. Yes, very well.
(William Green, the constable, produced the bag that was taken from under his apron, and the sugar.
JOHN BLATCH sworn. Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the gangsmen belonging to Sali's quay.
Q. Who are your partners? - A.

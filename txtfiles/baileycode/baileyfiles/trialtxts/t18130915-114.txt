            . I am an umbrella-maker
, I live at 53, High Holborn


. On the 13th of September I lost my parasol, between two and three in the afternoon, As I was engaged at the back end of the shop I saw the prisoner step in and take it off the door inside, and run off with it; being lame myself I could not pursue him, but requested my servant, who brought back the parasol. The prisoner escaped.
Q. How do you know it is the same man - A. I saw him take it.
Q. It was momently done - A. Yes, it was. In about three hours afterwards I saw the prisoner at Hatton Garden office. I am sure he is the same man. He was taken up for a similar offence the same evening.

            . I am shop-woman to Mr. Nutting. My master said a man had taken a parasol from the door. I ran after him down Hand-court; he put the parasol under his apron; he was stopped by the populace in Warwick-court. I know he is the same man. He hoped I would have mercy on him, and many gentlemen said I had better let him go, as I had the parasol. I let him go. This is the parasol; it is Mr. Nutting's. I never lost sight of him.
Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated in liquor all day long; the next morning I found myself in prison.

JOHN GORDON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Stephen Bately Ecclestone, from his person.






STEPHEN BATELY ECCLESTONE
. I live in Leadenhall-street. On the evening of the 11th of December, I was in Gracechurch-street—a gentle-man tapped me on the shoulder, and gave me information—I examined my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had felt it safe a minute before—I followed the gentleman, who pursued and took the prisoner—my handkerchief has not been found.





JOHNSON ELLETSON
. I was in Gracechurch-street about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prosecutor walking about two yards before me—I saw the quick motion of hands which attracted my attention, and saw the prisoner and another, his companion—the prisoner, with his right-hand, took hold of the prosecutor's pocket and with his left drew the handkerchief—at the same moment I saw it pass to the hands of his companion—I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and told him of his loss, and without waiting, I followed the prisoner, who had run off—when we got to the end of Finch-lane he was between me and the policeman—I intended to give him in charge, but he made back into Cornhill—I called the policeman, and ran after him myself—I overtook him at the bottom of Birchin-lane—I am positive the prisoner is the man.





JOHN PICKARD
 (City police-constable, No. 550.) I was on duty in Lombard-street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I ran to Birchin-lane, and saw the prisoner and Mr. Elletson on the ground—I took the prisoner.

Prisoners Defence. If I took the handkerchief why did he not stop me? I was making the best of my way home.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

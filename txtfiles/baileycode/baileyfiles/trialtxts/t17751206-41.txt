            . I am general superintender of the East India merchants goods. I stoped the prisoner last Friday with four pound of leaf tobacco, just coming out of a lighter, in which there were some hogsheads of tobacco with the heads out; he had been employed among the hogsheads; he had some of the tobacco in his pocket, and some in the inside of his breeches.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I picked up the tobacco, and was going to carry it to the cooper's to put in the tar-box; when I was about six yards from the lighter this man stopped me.

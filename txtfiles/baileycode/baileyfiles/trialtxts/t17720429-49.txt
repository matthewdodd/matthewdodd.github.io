            ; we are lightermen

; on the 3d of March we had ten chaldron of coals in a barge at Puddle Dock; I saw the prisoner and two other persons in the barge, about eight o'clock in the evening. We had lost coals before, so I was upon the watch; I saw the prisoner come out of the barge with a bag on his shoulder, containing about two pecks of coals; I seized him, and he immediately dropt the bag, and begged of me to forgive him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was easing myself, and seeing two boys in the barge, I went to them, and they gave me the coals to carry out for them: He called
Sarah Hall with whom he had formerly worked; who said he behaved well to her.

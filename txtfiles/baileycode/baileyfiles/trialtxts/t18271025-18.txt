. The prisoner had been a fortnight in my employ - I took him from his father; he came from sea. On Friday, the 21st of September, after five o'clock in the evening, I gave him a sovereign to purchase some pamphlets for sale - he did not return; I did not see him again till his father had given him into custody at the Mansion House, on the Tuesday following; he has never returned me the sovereign or the pamphlets.

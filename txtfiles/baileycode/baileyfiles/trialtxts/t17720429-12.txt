             I am a victaler
 and live in Pall Mall


; one of my children alarmed me on the 14th of March, with an outcry that a man had run down from my chamber with something; I went in pursuit of the man and saw the prisoner running at a distance about an hundred yards from my door, he continued running till I overtook him; I found my waistcoat under his arm and under his coat.
Prisoner's Defence.
I distribute hand bills for marking letters upon linen. I was going by and picked up this waistcoat; the prosecutor charged me with it; the chairmen wanted to duck me; I begged to be taken before a justice. I had two witnesses to prove that I found the waistcoat, but they are just gone home.

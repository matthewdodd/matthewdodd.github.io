            . I am in the employ of Thomas Dexter - he is a pawnbroker
, and lives in Whitechapel-road. On the 4th of August I saw the prisoner take these five handkerchiefs off the ground - I cannot tell how they came there; I had hung them up in the morning on a book, about two yards within the shop; it was between two and three o'clock; he stood just outside and reached in - he had not been in the shop; I followed him, stopped him, and asked what he had got in his hat - he said nothing. I told him a person had seen him put some handkerchiefs into his hat, and desired him to come back - he said he would; he turned, and came back a few steps - he then gave me the handkerchiefs out of his hat, and wished me to leave him - I said"No, I will take you back;" he kept dodging me about, and then ran away. I pursued, called for assistance, and some gentleman stopped him, and took him to my master's, who gave him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)

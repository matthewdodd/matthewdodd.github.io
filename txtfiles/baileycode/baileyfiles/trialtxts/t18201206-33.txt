            . I am Master of the ship Fortitude
. On the 16th of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down Whitechapel


, opposite George-yard, the prisoner fell against my chest most violently, and made a snatch at my watch - he got my four seals, a key, and a ring, but not my watch. I pursued him up George-yard, but lost him. Next morning I described him at Lambeth-street. I saw him next night between seven and eight o'clock, and I am positive he is the man - his face was within an inch of mine, and I was perfectly sober.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, about two o'clock, on the 17th of November, at the Cross Keys, public-house, Wentworth-street, not far from George-yard. He said he could prove by one hundred people, where he was at the time.

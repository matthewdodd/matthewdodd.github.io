THOMAS ROBERTS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of July, 4 half-crowns, 1 shilling, and 2 pence, the monies of 



Elizabeth Dismore, from her person.






ELIZABETH DISMORE
. I am a widow. I was in the parlour of the Black Horse public-house, in York-street, Westminster, on the 23rd of July, taking some refreshment—the prisoner sat on my right hand—he was quite a stranger—I had changed a sovereign, and received seven half-crowns

and two shillings—I had paid some money away, and had the rest of the half crowns and some other silver in my right-hand pocket—I felt my dress move several times on the side where the prisoner sat, but I did not suspect him, till a person told me I was robbed—the prisoner was taken and searched in my presence, and four half-crowns, one shilling; and two pence found on him—I am confident I lost them out of my pocket.

Prisoner. She was with some soldiers, and was very much intoxicated. Witness. I was not—it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night





JOHN BURR
. I am a writer. I was at the public-house, and sat next to the prisoner—I had not known him before—I had seen the prosecutrix before, but was not acquainted with her—a young man came to me and said, "I think she is being robbed"—I turned and saw the prisoner drawing his hand from her gown—I seized his hand, and found in it four half-crowns, one shilling, and two pence.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been hay-making the whole week, and that was the money I received for my week's work—I came from Uxbridge the same day.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

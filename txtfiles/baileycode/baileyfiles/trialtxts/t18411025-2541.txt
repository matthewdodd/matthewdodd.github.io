JOHN JONES
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of October, 2 watches, value 8l. 8s., the goods of 



Thomas Collingridge.






CHARLES CROSS
. I am shopman to Thomas Collingridge, a watchmaker, in Aldersgate-street. On the 2nd of October the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I had got any good second-hand watches—I told him we bad—he said he was recommended by Mr. Rolls, a carrier, down below—I showed him a watch, he asked the price—I told him four guineas—he liked it very well—I showed him another—he said he hardly knew which to have—he determined on one, and left 1s.—he said he would call in half-an-hour—he came, and said, "Is the watch ready?"—he said he did not know whether he would take that or the other—I showed him the two—he then asked me to give him a glass of water, as he was a tee-totaller—I did not like that, and I did not give it him—I shut the door—he asked me again—I sent a boy up stairs for the water—the prisoner then took both the watches, hit roe oh the side of my head, and ran away with them—he was taken in Jewin-crescent—he threw these watches (now produced) away—they were picked up—they are my master's.





MARY MOSS
. I am married. On the 2nd of October, as I crossed Aldersgate-street to Jewin-crescent, a man ran suddenly by me—in the course of a minute there was an alarm of "Stop thief"—I picked up the two watches.





DANIEL CARTER
 (City police-constable, No. 148.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and took the prisoner.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you take a letter from him? A. Yes—it is not here now.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

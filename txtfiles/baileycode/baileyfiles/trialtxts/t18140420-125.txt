On the 2nd of March, in the evening, my young man finished off one hat in particular, and put it in the locker in the window; the next morning my young man told me the hat was missing, and the hat was found in the prisoner's box; it was brought to me. I discovered it was my hat. The man prisoner told me himself he was in my house between six and seven in the morning; his wife gave him the hat.

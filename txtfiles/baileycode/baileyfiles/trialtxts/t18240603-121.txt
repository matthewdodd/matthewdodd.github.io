            , who are haberdashers


, and reside in Holborn. On the 12th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some ribbons; I shewed her some; she asked to see some narrower, which I found for her, she had some cut off. I saw her take a piece out of the drawer, and conceal it, and then put it into her right hand pocket. A young man who had also seen it told Mr. Townsend. Mr. Hardwick searched her, and found it in her pocket. She said it was the first offence she had committed.

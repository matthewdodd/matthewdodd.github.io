             (Police-constable D 41.) On the 18th of December I was in Crawford-street, and saw the prisoner near Mr. Flynn's shop, standing against the rails, with a bundle in one hand, and he was handling some women's shoes; I staid until he walked away with the bundle - I followed him, and asked if he had taken any shoes from the door; he said he knew nothing about them - I took him back, and in the bundle I found a pair of new shoes, which Mr. Flynn owned, and these three brushes.

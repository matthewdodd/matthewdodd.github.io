FIANCES RANCE
. I am the wife of Alexander Rance, and live at Greenwich—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 25th of October I got up as usual, and called for the prisoner, but found she was gone—shortly after the policeman came and brought these things—they are mine, and had all been safe—the prisoner had no right to remote them—she had been with me seven weeks—she had no character, but I knew her father—I had her from the Refuge for the Destitute.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (police-constable R 49.) About six o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner in Church-street, Greenwich, with a large bundle containing these things—I stopped her, and brought these things hack to her mistress, who identified them as hers.




GUILTY

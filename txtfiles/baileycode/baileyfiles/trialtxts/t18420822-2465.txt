ANN REYNOLDS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of July, 1 jacket, value 7s.; and 2lbs. weight of tobacco, value 6s.; the goods of 



Charles M'Canna; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES M'CANNA
. I belong to the ship Montezuma. I met the prisoner, on the 29th of July, in Blue gate-fields—she wanted me to go with her—I said I had not much money—she said, if I paid her so much I could go—I gave her 3s. 6d., and went to a house, about nine o'clock—I sat there some time, and had some beer—I sat on a chair, took off my jacket, and hung it on the back of the chair—the prisoner took my jacket and' ran off with it—there were two pounds of tobacco in the pocket—I went after her, but there was something of a catch in the door, so that I could not get out—this is my jacket.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. You had known her some time? A. Not more than a month—I went backwards and forwards to her place—I have never been there without money—I visited her before I got my paynote—I had money when I received my note—I never told her I was ashamed to see her, as I had no money—I once showed her my monthly money-note—she took it from me—I rushed upon her and got it from her, and it was so torn that I was forced to get another—she asked me if I was going to sea again—I said yes, when she took the jacket and rushed out, and I saw no more of her till she came in the next morning—I said I would give her in charge, and her mother wanted to turn me out of the house, but I would not go—I did not agree to take 5s.—nobody offered me 5s.





THOMAS JOHN SHUTE
. I am a pawnbroker. This jacket was pawned by the prisoner, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, on the, 30th of July.





THOMAS HENRY ELLIS
 (police-constable K 303.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

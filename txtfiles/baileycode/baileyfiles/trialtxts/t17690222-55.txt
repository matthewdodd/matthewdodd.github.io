            . I live in Cross-street, Hatton-Garden





, and am a taylor
. On the 7th of this instant, February, I lost eighteen boys and men's coats, cloth and woollen; there were nine of each sort; three cloth waistcoats, and many livery waistcoats that I cannot give an account of; and a frock with a scarlet collar on it. We searched several places that night, but could find nothing. Here are some things that were stopped at 
               
                  Richard 
                  Newton 
               



            's, a pawnbroker, who lives by the corner of Benjamin-street, Cow-lane.


                  Richard 
                  Newton 
               



            . I had a bill from Mr. Fielding of these things, but I stopped these things before the bill came. (He produced two jackets and a frock.) They were brought by 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Hussey 
               



            . She said they were her brother's.
Q. Did you stop her?
Newton. No; I did not. She said they were her brother's. On the Saturday night before, a little boy came into my shop to pawn a cotton handkerchief for 1 s. he brought Hedges with him; after that he went and brought 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Hussey 
               



            , and I took it in of her. When she came to pawn the jackets, I told her, that if she did not go and fetch her brother, she should not have them again. She came then in the name of 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Evans 
               



            .
Prosecutor. I was robbed two separate times. The man at the bar declared before the Justice, if he was loose he would rob me the next day. (He takes up a waistcoat and coat). These were on his back when I took him up. (Produced and deposed to.) I lost these things about nine days before I lost the others. There were six coats taken at once; this was one of them.


                  John 
                  Heley 
               



            . When Mr. Newton came to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's he brought these coats. He had a warrant granted him to get the party. I went with him. When we got into Turnmill-street, we met Hedges and Hussey, and two other women. Newton said, they are the thieves. I asked Hussey what she had got in her apron; she said, What is that to you. I took and searched her, and found these jackets in her apron. (Five livery jackets produced.)
Q. to Prosecutor. Were any thing else lost at the time these were?
Prosecutor. The livery jackets were lost at the same time that the six coats were.
Heley. Hussey said Hedges gave them to her.
Q. What answer did he make to that?
Heley. He made none at all.
Q. Do you think he heard her?
Heley. I think he did, for he was just by her; Dalton was along with her. She had some sugar about her, which is in another indictment.


                  Thomas 
                  Bird 
               



            . I know 
               
                  Bridget 
                  Dalton 
               



            . She bought three livery waistcoats, and two short jackets of Hedges. (He points them out from the rest.) I was by at the time. It was a public house in Turnmill-street. She gave half a crown earnest.
Q. What public house?
Bird. It was at the sign of Wilkes's Head. She was to give 6 s. for them.
Q. When was this?
Bird. This was the day after they were lost. Hedges, I, and 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Hussey 
               



            , were at the taking of them. Hedges went into the house eight or nine times, and brought out something every time, and delivered them to 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Hussey 
               



            , and she brought them to me. I was with them when the six great coats and waistcoats were sold.
Q. Can you tell what business 
               
                  Bridget 
                  Dalton 
               



             follows?
Bird No; I cannot. I have not known her a great while. I never had any dealings with her but this once.

                  Edward 
                  Rowell 
               



             , were indicted for 


               assaulting 
                     
                        
                           Paul 
                           Chamberlain

 last, and taking from him a Cloath Coat, a Waistcoat, a pair of Shoes, a Hat, a Peruke, and a Linsey Woolsey Apron
            .
The Prosecutor thus depos'd, On the 21st of December last about two or three in the Morning, as I was coming towards Stock's Market



 with Greens, I being a Gardener
, two Persons came up to me, and the tallest (which appear'd to be Rowell) put a Pistol to my Breast, and said G - d D - n you Deliver, saying, he would shoot me through the Body if I refused; upon this, he dragg'd me down a Lane, and beat me in a barbarous Manner, the shortest (which is Spurgins) did not strike me, nor use me ill, though the other took off my Cloaths, and then bound my Feet with a Cord and left me in the Snow; the shortest would fain have loos'd me, but the other would not suffer it; after some Time they went away together, and the shortest coming back, said, if he went to Newgate for it, he would have Compassion on me, and accordingly wiped the Blood from my Mouth, which flow'd in abundance from the Blows that the other had given me; after this, he bound my Head with his own Handkerchief, and cried over me, saying, this was his first Fact, and if he led this Course of Life he should be hang'd and if he left it he should be kill'd: After this, I heard of the Prisoner's being taken, and it being told me that one of them had my Shoes on, I went to Newgate and charg'd it on Spurgins, who confess'd it, saying, that she and Ned (meaning Rowell) were guilty, but as he had Compassion on me, he begg'd I would have the same for him.


                  Thomas 
                  Conoway 
               



             and 
               
                  Nathaniel 
                  Benson 
               



             severally depos'd, That they heard Spurgins's Confession:Upon which the Jury brought in their Verdict, that Spurgins was 


               Guilty
            . 


               Death
            . But 

               acquitted
             Rowell, by Reason the Prosecuter could not swear to his Person.
However, they intimated to the Court, that though they were obliged to bring in this Verdict in consequence of his Confession, yet they hoped he would be represented as an Object of Mercy.
This Rowell 


               pleaded guilty
             to an Indictment laid against him and Spurgins for 


               stealing Pidgeons
            .

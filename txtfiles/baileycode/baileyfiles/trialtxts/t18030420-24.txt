             sworn. - I keep a hosier and haberdasher's shop
: On the 10th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in with another boy to buy a waistcoat and a handkerchief; one tried on a waistcoat, while I shewed the other a handkerchief; I suppose they stopped about ten minutes; they did not buy any thing; another person came in, which took off my attention; I observed the prisoner taking his hand from the box where the handkerchiefs were; I accused him of taking something out; he told me he had not; I asked him if he had any objection to my looking, and he said, no; I then opened his coat, and I saw the handkerchiefs; the other was a taller lad than him.

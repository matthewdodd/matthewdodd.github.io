            . The prisoner came to me on the 23d of May, and said he was servant to Mr. Jones of Oldford, who is a printer; that his master's cart was detained in the Green-yard for having run against a gentleman's coach, and desired me to let him have half a guinea to redeem it; Mr. Jones does business for us; I let him have half a guinea.
Mr. Jones. I had not any cart in town I think that day; I am sure I had none in the Green-yard; the prisoner does not live in my service, he has not for two years.

I leave myself to the mercy of the Court: I have a wife and two children.

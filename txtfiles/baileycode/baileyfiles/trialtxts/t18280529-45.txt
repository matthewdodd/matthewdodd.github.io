                  , from his person
            .
SAMUEL PRORART. I live at Maidstone, in Hertfordshire. On the 21st of April I was in London; I fell into company with the prisoner and another man about a quarter or half-past two o'clock - they were strangers to me: I first met the other person in Smithfield; he appeared to be a horse-jobber; and in about ten minutes the prisoner came up; we went into a public-house before the prisoner came; they appeared quite strangers; when I saw the other man I was going to Chiswell-street, and asked him to show me the way - he said said he would, and asked who I was going to see; I said, Mr. Smith - he asked me to go into a public-house and take a glass of ale, as he found himself rather thirsty, and in about five minutes the prisoner came in; we were sitting down at a table - the prisoner sat at a distance off, quite in the middle of the room; he got up and shook hands with me, and claimed acquaintance - I said I knew nothing of him - I had never seen him before; the other man was telling me about different people in Gloucestershire, horse-dealers and others, whom I knew, and that made me think him a countryman. The prisoner went and sat down; he pulled out a bag, and said his old aunt had left him 800l., and he meant to spend it - he was sitting quite by himself; only one other person was in the room; he said he had come out of Leicestershire, where he had resided, and was determined to spend it; he pulled some papers out of the bag, which appeared to be notes; we had two pints of ale, and he had two glasses of porter by himself; he did not join our company at that house; I was perfectly sober - the prisoner appeared as if he was half tipsy, but I found afterwards that was sham; before we left the house he said he had been paying a d-d rogue of a lawyer 60l. to put his money right and get it; I came out with the other man, and went on to go to Chiswell-street; the prisoner followed us down stairs - I believe this house was the Punch Bowl public-house; I went on to look for Smith, in Chiswell-street, as I had a letter to deliver to him; the other man walked along the street - the prisoner came and caught hold of my arm; I told him I could walk by myself; he forced his company on me; he only walked a few yards with me; the first man I met said, "Now, can you see yonder butcher's shop?" I said Yes: he said,"You go there and inquire - they will tell you where Smith lives; I want to step back for a necessary purpose;" I had lost the prisoner before that; I went to the butcher, who said Smith had moved; I then returned back to Smithfield, and lit on this countryman, but not Mills - he said,"Where are you going?" I said to the Bank; he said,"Very well, I am going that way;" I went with him along the street a good way, and through several passages, into a small square, and there we lit on the prisoner at the bar; he came and said, "Here is a drop of very nice ale - come and have a drop with me;" the other man said, "Let us go, it won't hinder us a minute - he seems a good kind young man," and so we went, and there was a quart of porter ordered; we drank some porter, and then there was a cloth put on the table, and some beef-steaks put down - it was not by my order - I knew nothing about it; they had been talking about something to eat; I eat some of the steak; as soon as it came in the prisoner asked me to give him change for a half-sovereign, saying he had no small notes, his notes were all hundreds and hundred and fifties; I gave him change, and when I pulled out the silver my notes were in the same pocket; I pulled them out, and put them into another pocket - he saw I had got notes; I gave him four half-crowns; he then asked me to give him change for half a crown, to give the girl something, as he wished to behave like a gentleman, and he had plenty of money; in giving him change the half-sovereign fell; he pulled it between his fingers - I said, "That won't do to give half a sovereign for a sixpence," and I had that back- he gave the girl sixpence, and before the steaks were taken away, in came three pipes and three glasses of gin and water; I did not order any of them; they asked me to take a pipe - I would not, and said gin and water I did not like; they said I should have brandy; I said I would have neither rum nor brandy; the prisoner said, "Taste it, you never drank any so good;" I tasted it, and found it was all gin, or gin and water, as they say; but sometimes they draw gin and water out of the same cask; I said I had two or three places to go to, and could not stop any longer; then the countryman got up, and said, "If you are determined to go, I shall be very much obliged to you to show me the difference in appearance between the notes you have, and these large notes this man has, for notes of 100l. and 150l. are notes I am not accustomed to, and I am in the habit of taking a great deal of money in horse-dealing; I told him he had better show some of his own, as no doubt he had some; he said he had nothing but country notes, or he would not ask me; I said as he was so good as to show me where Smith lived, I ought to do him a favour if I could, but it was not customary to show notes in a public-house; I produced them, and the prisoner pulled out some notes, and folded them over his finger; one finger was at the top - I could see "Fifty," but could not see what bank it was, as he held his hand over that. The prisoner was on my right hand, and the other man on the left; the prisoner took hold of my notes, whipped them out of my hand, and turned from the table; the other man kept his finger on the notes when they were down on the table; I caught hold of the notes - the prisoner ran off with my notes, leaving the flash notes behind; the other man did not offer to move. I gave the constable the flash notes. I went out directly to see for the prisoner; the other man said, "You go that way and I will go this," and so I lost them both; it was of no use to detain the other man, as he had not got the money. I surrendered next day in discharge of bail, at the King's Bench prison, and before twelve o'clock that day the prisoner came in there to play at rackets - I knew him directly, and laid hold of him; the officer searched him, but neither of my notes were found; I am certain of his person - I could tell him from five hundred; I saw him with four or five hundred in the King's Bench.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you ever seen any one since who is very much like him? A. Not but what I could swear to the prisoner; I never said I had seen another person exceedingly like him, nor did I ever think so; I have seen nobody at all like him - he might be about two hours in my company; he bragged so much about his money and his old aunt, which made me notice him, and he had a little bit of a sore on his lip - it has got better since.

            . I am a constable. I went to the Sun and Punch Powl public-house, Long-lane, with the prosecutor; it was not there he lost his notes - we were five or six hours looking for the house where he was robbed, but could not find it: I searched about Bartholomew-close and Smithfield - he never took me out of the City to look for it; I was sent for to the lobby of the King's Bench to take the prisoner - I first saw Probart on the 23d of April and received the two flash notes from him; I asked Probart in the prisoner's presence, what he charged him with; he said he had robbed him of a 10l. and a 5l. Bank note - he said he had had no such thing from him; next morning as I was coming to Guildhall with the prisoner, he said he had had the money - I told him not to say anything to me to criminate himself; he said he had nothing to say further than that he thought it hard he should suffer, for four of them shared the money, and he got but 3l. odd for his share.
Cross-examined. Q. Was anybody present when he told you this? A. Two or three were behind me; whether they heard it I cannot say - there was the prosecutor, a friend of the prisoner's, and the tipstaff; 2the prosecutor was not above three or four yards behind, I suppose, but I did not look behind - all the places the prosecutor took me to, to look for the house were about Bartholourew-hospital; he showed me one or two houses and said they were like it, but when he got in he said they were not the house; I cannot swear he was robbed in the City.
COURT. Q. Did he ever take you out of the City boundary? A. No, not by a considerable distance.
SAMUEL PRORART re-examined. The notes produced are what the prisoner left behind instead of mine.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the sign of the house, or the street you were robbed in? A. No - I do not say it was in the City.
COURT. Q. How far might it be from the New Postoffice? A. A very short distance.
The flash notes were here read, one was headed Bank of Fashion, engaging to cut hair in the first style or forfeit 10,000l. the other headed Bank of Elegance, engaging to do the same, or forfeit 50l.

            . I am a constable of the King's Bench, where the prisoner was taken. I was sent for and searched him - I found nothing on him but 6d. and a few halfpence; not being well I sent for Dutton to take him.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you follow him to Guildhall? A. I did; the prosecutor was in my custody - he was suffered to go before the Magistrate on my word to bring him back; I did not hear the prisoner say he had the money, but he was not in my charge.
Prisoner's Defence. It is totally false, as to what Dutton says; I do not think he is a fit man - his evidence should not be taken, for I know his character - he keeps a brothel, and lives on the prostitution of young women. I never stated such a thing to him - the prosecutor has taken me for another person.
JURY to SAMUEL PROBART. Q. What part of Smithfield did you meet the other man in, after you returned from Chiswell-street? A. Just before I came to the house, we turned into at first - I believe it is the Punch Bowl; we went from there down to the Post-office - he said he was going to the Bank, and would show me the way; we went through several lanes - he said they were the nearest way.

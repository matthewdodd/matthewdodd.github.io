RICHARD TAYLOR. I am a smith
, and live at No. 19, Maiden-lane


. On the 5th of July I had a stove at my door for sale - I heard some one had taken it - I pursued the prisoner, who had got thirty or forty yards - he dropped the stove and went on - I pursued and took him; he was either intoxicated or appeared so - I believe he only appeared so - he made a dreadful resistance.

            . I am a cutler. I saw the prisoner coming down with the stove, and Mr. Taylor in pursuit of him - he threw down the stove just by where I was and walked away three or four yards further, when Taylor collared him.

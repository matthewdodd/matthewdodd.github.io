            . I am a linen-draper
 in Long Acre


. On Monday the 7th of February I had been from home; when I returned I found the prisoner in custody in my shop. I had that morning exposed several things at the door upon a stall; among them was this piece of linen cloth.
- Harman. I live opposite the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner looking at some goods at the door, and I saw him take a piece of cloth and put it in his apron, and go off with it; I went over and informed them of it; the prisoner turned down into Castle-street; there he was stopped and brought back with the cloth in his apron. (The cloth produced).
Prosecutor . I always write my name on every piece of cloth I buy, and there is the name in my own hand writing upon this piece of cloth.
The prisoner, in his defence, said he picked the cloth up off the ground.

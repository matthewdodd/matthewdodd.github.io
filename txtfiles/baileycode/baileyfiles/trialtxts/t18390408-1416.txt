SUSANNAH BURNS
. I am the wife of Patrick Burns, he belongs to the Royal Artillery. On the 9th of March we were at the Tower—the prisoner who was a stranger, came to me and inquired for my husband, Patrick Burns—he said he was my mother's brother's son—he said he had come from Ireland, and he had brought me a box weighing four cwt. containing tea and sugar, soap, chocolate, seven silk handkerchiefs, and some silk dresses, a cage and two parrots—he said he had brought it from abroad for me, and asked if I had any money, he wanted 2s. 6d. he said, to release this box from the Custom-house—I gave him half-a-crown—he said that was not sufficient, and I gave him a shilling more—he said, "Cousin, don't think I want to do you any harm, don't think I would take any thing from you, I would rather give you something"—he sat down a few minutes, and then went away, and I never saw him again till my husband took him—I never got my box—my husband met him on the Sunday, the next day, and said, "Come along with me, you have robbed my wife"—he said, "Take my coat and hat, and 11d. in halfpence, and let me go"—he said, "No, I will give you in charge."

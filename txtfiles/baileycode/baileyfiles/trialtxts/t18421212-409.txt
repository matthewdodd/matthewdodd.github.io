 was indicted

JOSEPH LOCKYER CLOTHIER
. I am in partnership with my brother, William Clothier—we are pawnbrokers, and live in Frederick-place, Borough-road. I had a shawl fastened inside my door—I saw it safe on the 23rd of Nov. about seven o'clock—soon afterwards I heard a noise like a string snapping—I turned my head, and saw the corner of the shawl leaving the shop—I ran

out, and saw the prisoner running—I saw him drop the shawl, and I directly caught him—it was my shawl—this is it.

Prisoner. It was between seven and eight o'clock at night—it was dark; he could not see who dropped it. Witness. Yes, I distinctly saw him drop it—he ran into the middle of the road, which and well lighted.

RICHADRD Wood (police-constable M 115.) I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of "Stop thief." I ran, and slipped down in the road, and somebody running by threw the shawl away. I got up, and he took me, and called for a policeman; there was not one for a quarter of a mile in the road, and he said, "Go to the station." I went with him, and the policeman came and took me there.

EDWARD NEWEN (policeman-constable M 65.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the clerk of the peace of Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

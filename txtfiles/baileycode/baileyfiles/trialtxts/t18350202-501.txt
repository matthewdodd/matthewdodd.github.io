THOMAS BALL
. I am a bricklayer. On the 16th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner snatch a hat out of the prosecutor's window, and run away with it—I pursued him, and never lost sight of him—I collared him—he directly threw it down—I took it up, and took him back to Marks's.





MARK MARKS
. This hat is mine—it was drawn out of my window, where it had hung.





WILLIAM HUNT
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was a witness, and know him to be the man—he was tried then by the name of Giles.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

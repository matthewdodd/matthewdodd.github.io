            . I am a watchman in the service of the New River Company
. I was on duty at half-past four o'clock in the morning, on the 26th of November; I took off my great-coat and laid it on the vice-bench, in the smith's shop, while I went into the engine-house - I was about an hour in the engine-house; when I returned my coat was gone - the prisoner worked there, and I hadsome suspicion, and went in the afternoon to look for him- I found him coming out of Smith field, and gave charge of him; on his person was found this handkerchief, which had been in my coat pocket, and this knife which had been by the side of it.

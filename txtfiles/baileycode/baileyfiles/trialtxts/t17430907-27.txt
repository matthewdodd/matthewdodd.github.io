Margaret Green. The Prisoner came into my Shop in Cranbourne-Alley, by Leicester-Fields, and asked for a Hat, I shewed her one, which was too large, and while I was getting another, I saw her take a Hat off the Counter, and she pinned it under her Apron to her Petticoat; she bid me Half a Crown for one, and was going out of the Shop, and said she would not have any; said I, if you will have none, I must search you; she ran away from me, I followed her, and brought her back, and she offer'd me Sixpence to make it up. I took the Hat from her, and desired

             to carry her up Stairs, in order to search her.

            . As she was going up Stairs, I found a Piece of Ribbon upon the Prisoner, and pulled it from under her Cloak, and Mrs Green said, Oh, you Hussey, that's my Ribbon, I sold some of it just now.

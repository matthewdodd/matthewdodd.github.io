            . Last fast-day I was at the evening service at St. Paul's.


 As soon as it was ended, going out at the iron gate from the choir, I found a pulling at my coat; I put my hand instantly into my left-hand pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I saw the prisoner at the bar close by my left-hand. He kept his elbow in a suspicious position, close to his body. I said, friend, I have lost something, let me see what you have got under your coat. He would not, but returned towards the north isle, saying, he was no sailor, and had never been at sea, and went as fast as he could from me. When he was got near the wall he was surrounded with people. I pull'd his arm up, and my handkerchief drop'd on the pavement. I took it up. (Produced in court, and deposed to.) I had wore it in my pocket all that day, till that time.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the handkerchief coming out of the church.



               Guilty
            .
There was another indictment found against him for a crime of the same nature.

JOHN DISSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
24th of February, 100 yards of printed cotton, value 2s., the goods of 



Isaac Henly Hands-comb.


MR. BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






THOMAS JOSEPH WEST
. I am a policeman. On the 24th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Curzon-street, May-fair, and saw the prisoner and another man loitering about the prosecutor's shop—another constable came up—I communicated my suspicions to him, and continued to watch them—I saw his companion go into the shop and bring a large bundle out, which he handed to the prisoner—they parted, and we pursued them—I pursued the prisoner, but did not catch him—I lost sight of him—I continued going in the direction he had run, and found a quantity of prints in the carriage road.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Not to my knowledge—it was rather dark—I can positively swear to him—I saw him about twenty times, as I was watching him—I lost sight of him for about two minutes.





JAMES LOCKYER
 (police-constable C 181.) I was in company with West, and saw the prisoner with another, who was loitering about the prosecutor's shop door—I saw the other go into the shop and come out with a bundle before him, which he gave to the prisoner—they directly separated, and the prisoner went up Half-moon-street—he looked round, saw me, and ran away—he dropped the bundle in the carriage way, and he was secured without my losing sight of him.





JOHN PICKERING
. I am shopman to Isaac Henly Hanscomb. These cottons are my master's property—I saw them on the 24th, a few minutes before they were taken away.
(Alice Williams, Cranford-mews; Thomas Pratt, of Devonshire-street; and John Williams, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 9th of June, on Sunday evening, I was coming from Kentish Town, to London; I was walking in the foot path, in the field on this side Pancrass church yard


, between that and the Inoculating hospital; I heard St. Paul's clock strike seven, as I was in Pancrass Church-yard; about twenty yards before I came to the bridge, I was met by two men; they were coming side by side; I was going to make way to let them pass me, immediately they bid me stop; and each presented a pistol directly; the next word was your money; upon demanding my money; I threw myself back, and parried off their pistols with my cane; as they advanced, I retreated, and kept them off with my cane; it occurred to my memory that I should have a chance, that if they fired their pistols they would not by my motion hit me; in retreating as they advanced, I got my foot in a little gutter in the place; I dropt a little on one side; just as I dropt, the prisoner said. shoot him, d - n me shoot him; immediately the other man, who is not here, snapp'd his pistol at me; I saw plenty of fire, but the pistol did not go off; his pistol not going off, this man then snapp'd his pistol; I saw plenty of fire; but that too, thank God, did not go off; after they had snapp'd their pistols; I thought: myself pretty safe. I kept my guard; I wanted to draw my sword; but had not an opportunity, least, if I dropt my guard, they should get in upon me; I struck the other man a violent blow on the side of his head, which I believe stuned him; after that as I retreated back he did not advance upon me; this man advanced faster than the other; I changed my stick to my left hand; I thought it my only opportunity to draw my sword; he advanced upon me; he went to make a blow at me, I stept forward and took him a lone.
Q. Did the prisoner cock his pistol again?
Mr. Croker. I imagine not; I kept them in action; I believe they had not an opportunity: after I had made my lunge, having-but just hold of my sword, my sword went out of my hand, I flew up to him, took him by the collar and pulled my sword out of his body, with my left hand; as soon as I had done that, he never spoke but dropt upon his face; when I had drawn my sword out of his body, I was looking to see where the other was; I had lost him, I saw him behind me; I went up to him and said, d - n you, I am ready for you now, advance; as I went towards him, away he went; then he called out to his companion, d - n me, come along.
Q. Did not he see him fall?
Mr. Croker. I do not know, the prisoner lay upon the ground about half a minute; he got up and went two or three yards and down he dropt again; I did not know the consequence of my staying to take him; I went away and left him there; next day I went to Sir

            's; he said if he was not dead he must go to some hospital, and would soon be taken, that was the way Sir

                   Fielding
               



            's people took him; there is some of the blood upon the sword now; upon Monday evening I was informed a man was taken that was carried to an hospital on Sunday night; I went on Tuesday morning to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's to see him; as soon as I saw him, I knew him directly, and swore to him.

                   Iveside
               



            . I am a surgeon in St. Bartholomew's hospital; last Sunday threeweeks, the 9th of June about twelve o'clock the prisoner was brought into the hospital; I asked him what was the matter with him; he told me he was wounded in his breast; I asked him how, he told me a coming over the fields, between Pancrass and the Small pox hospital, he was stopt by a couple of footpads, who demanded his money, that he told them he was a poor man and had none; they insisted upon searching his pockets: he told them they should not; upon that one of them stabbed him with a tuck; upon which he fell to the ground, and they then searched his pockets; finding nothing in his pockets they took away his shoes and coat; that he lay sometime before he was able to get up; he got up at last with difficulty; got home, and from there was brought to the hospital; the wound was on the right side between the fifth and sixth rib, it went obliquely downwards.
Q. What did it seem to be done with?
Mr. Iveside. A three edged instrument, and probably a tuck.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went out to take a walk along with a particular acquaintance of mine, that I know on the other side of the water, at the time I made an elopement from my wife; he was going into the country asked me to take a walk with him; I condescended to go part of the way with him; we went towards Hampstead, we stopt by the way and had a glass at some of the houses: it was rather late when I got home, it was about half after ten o'clock, when I met with these two men, and received the wound; one was rather behind the other; the first man that came up collared me; he tript up my heels and demanded my money; I told them I was a poor man, I worked hard for my bread and had none; he insisted to have it; he took about nine shillings and some odd halfpence out of my pocket; I changed half a guinea at a house before I left it; he took the silver out of my pocket, and left I believe two or three halfpence, which they found in that waistcoat pocket, when I was carried to the hospital; after they got the money they wanted my cloaths, which I refused to give them; one of the men stabbed me with some instrument in a stick, as I took to be a tuck, or whatever they call it; I fell down, and got up, it deprived me partly of my senses; they stript me of my coat, hat, and shoes; I had plated buckels in my shoes, which I suppose they thought silver. I made the best of my way home; when I had recovered myself I met a couple of people upon the way; I begged them by the tender mercies of God to assist me in prayer, for I was a dead man I believed; they left me; I went away as fast as I could; when I got home they sent for a surgeon; the surgeon said I was stabbed by some means or other; they said as I was a poor man and not able to pay the expences, they would take me into the hospital; my friends carried me to the hospital; the next day this gentleman came and said, I was a man that stopt him upon the high-way and made an attempt to rob him; it was well known I always was a hard working man, and worked hard for my bread; I have no witnesses: I am a shoe maker
 by trade.

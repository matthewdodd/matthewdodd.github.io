 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



John Jenkins, from his person.






JOHN JENKINS
. I live in St. John-street-road. On the 11th of August; about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the corner of Wilderness-row, taking some oysters—I felt a pull at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner, and my handkerchief was in his hand, and partly out of my pocket. I collared him, and then my handkerchief came quite out and fell down—I am sure no one could have taken it out but him.





STEPHEN SADLER
. I am a parish officer. I saw the prisoner attempting to get away, and took him to the station.

Prisoner. I was at the corner of Wilderness-row—the prosecutor turned and asked me for his handkerchief—I said I had not got it—he looked down and found it at his feet—there were several other persons besides me.


Prosecutor. There was no one near roe but him.




GUILTY
.** Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

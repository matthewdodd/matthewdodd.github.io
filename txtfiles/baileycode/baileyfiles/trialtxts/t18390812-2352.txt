HENRY ATTFIELD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of August, 1 flannel shirt, value 2s.; 1 shirt, value 2s.; and 2 shifts, value 3s.; the goods of 



Edward Patmore.






SARAH PATMORE
. I am the wife of Edward Patmore, a labourer, and live in Great Mitchell-street. On Saturday morning last, I hung some linen out to dry in the back yard—I went to take it in about half-past ten o'clock, and found the prisoner in the yard taking the linen off the line—I never saw him before—he had these things in his arms, and threw then on the dust-hole—I asked what he did there—he said he had been to the privy—he had pulled his boots off to go through the passage, and had them in his arms, he rushed by me, and ran through into the street, and the policeman stopped him without my losing sight of him.





RICHARD MADDOX
. I was on duty last Saturday night in Brick-lane—I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutrix after him—I stopped him.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

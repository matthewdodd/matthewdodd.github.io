JOHN LUCKER
. I am in the employ of John Coutts, a baker. I was out with his bread on the 14th of November, in Kensington-square, between two and three o'clock—I left my basket there about five minutes—when I came back I missed two half-quartern loaves—I received information, and pursued the prisoner—I saw him about one hundred yards from the basket—I came up with him, and found the loaves on him—they were my master's—I did not know him before.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.—To be sent to Juvenile Prison at the Isle of Wight.

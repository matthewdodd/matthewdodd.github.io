            , Esq., who lives in Orchard-street


. On the 17th of March, the prisoner was recommended to me to assist in cleaning harness - I was with him about two hours, and then left the mews. He asked me to give him a few halfpence to get some victuals, I gave him 2 s. 6 d. I returned in about an hour, he was gone - I missed two reins and four bridle-bits, and found him in David-street. He said if I would say nothing he would get them.

            . I am coachman to Mr. Hall. I assisted Gardner to put the harness together, every thing was then right. I lent the prisoner a sponge and oil-brush to clean them with - when I returned he was gone with them, the other things were missing.
RICHARD SCOTCHMER. I am a groom. I saw the prisoner come out of the yard with the reins and bits in his hand on the 17th of March, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. I am sure he is the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I went to sleep, as I had been drinking; when I awoke the bits were gone.

JOHN KING. I am a dealer in marine-stores
, on Saffron-hill


. I missed these things from my shop, on the 18th of August - I had seen them two or three days before; the prisoners lodged in my house, and slept in a little parlour, and would pass through the shop to go out - they lodged about three weeks with me; I found the things at Loscombe's, No. 113, Saffron-hill, on the 20th, and knew them by the marks - they are children's caps; one pair of shoes is sown all roundthe other has a patch in the heel.

            . Q. Did you ever go by any other name? A. I went by the name of Wilson, in the army, for twenty-five years; I am illegitimate, but that was my father's name - I receive a pension in that name, but I was Christened by the name of 
               
                  John 
                  King
               



            ; I was bail for Mr. Pollock in the court of King'sbench, for 35l., - I can bail for 500l. if I choose; I had lost a quantity of goods, and refused to let you into my house that night, but told you to go to bed, and next morning you left; you once lost your child, and I said it was probably through your own drunkenness.

            . I live at No. 113, Saffron-hill. On the 16th of August the male prisoner sold me a pair of shoes for 5d., and on the 18th another pair for 5d.; I received three child's caps, a woman's cap and tippet from the female prisoner for 8d.
Prisoner. Q. Are your goods exposed for sale? A. Yes, outside and inside the shop; I live thirty-six doors from King.

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of August; the man said he did not care, he should easily get over it - I found them in an uninhabited house, in Castle-street, Saffron-hill.

            . Q. How was it uninhabited? A. It was not rented by any tenant; a person had leave to be in it, and he was cohabiting with her.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            's Defence. I have endeavoured to elicit from the prosecutor, the fact of a serious quarrel between us, in consequence of his accusing me of having intentionally lost my child - in consequence of this, I availed myself of the information I had of his having bailed Pollock in the name of King, and justifying in the name of Wilson, and informed Mrs. Pollock of it, and she refused to pay him 10s. for having been bail; I believe she wrote to say, if he attempted to make the claim, she would see into it - he received the letter on the Monday, and made this charge; I admit selling the things, but distinctly at his request; his wife as he calls her, not supplying him with funds to procure liquor; if I had stolen them, I should not have sold them so near his house.

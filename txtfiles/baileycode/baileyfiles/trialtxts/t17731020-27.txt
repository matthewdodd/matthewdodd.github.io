            . I live in Nottingham-court, St. Giles's


: I let the lodgings to the prisoner and another woman; the things mentioned in the indictment were the furniture of the lodgings; I missed them on Monday October the 4th; I had been out, and as I came home I looked up at the window, and saw the curtains gone; I took my wife up, and missed the things; the pawnbrokers have them. (They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

I was servant to the woman that took the lodgings; she went away in distress; she gave me the things to pawn, and I gave her the money; she is now in confinement in Newgate.

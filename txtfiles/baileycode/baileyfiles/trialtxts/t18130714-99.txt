            . I am an ironmonger
, 74, West Smithfield


. The prisoner worked for me.
Q. When did you lose your nails - A. I cannot say exactly the day; I was directed where to find the goods, and the moment I heard he was in the habit of selling these things; I examined the property. He had been selling to Mr. D'Valky; I told the prisoner that he had been selling nails to Mr. D'Valky, and I suspected they were mine; he told me he had bought them at a sale. I said I was surprized that he should have money to go to market that way; he then said he took them for a bad debt. In a day or two I went to Mr. D'Valky, I looked at the first bag, I saw they were mine, they had been returned from a customer.
MR. D'VALKY. I live upon Saffron-hill. I bough the nails of Mr. Truman, I gave either five-pence or five-pence halfpenny a pound for them. The prisoner brought his wife and children for me to suit with shoes; he then said I'll go and fetch the nails.
Prosecutor. They are my property; the value of both the bags of nails was about nine pounds before any of them were used. I can swear that I never sold either of the bags.

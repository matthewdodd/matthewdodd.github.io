            . I am a grocer
, and live in Shoreditch



. On the 24th of December, about five or six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came, in company with a man, who asked for a pennyworth of candied lemon-peel. The moment they went out Walters entered, and said they had taken two or three papers of copper off my desk; I ran out, took the prisoners, and gave them in charge - the other escaped. I found nothing on them. They came in and went out together, and stood by the desk.

            . I was looking through the window, and saw three boys - one bigger than the prisoners stood talking to Rickett at the desk, which joins the counter. Brown put his hand up, took one paper of halfpence, and gave them to the biggest boy; he then turned back and took another parcel, which I thought he put into hispocket. Plummer shoved him out of the way, and went into the same place, but whether he took any or not I cannot say. I saw them take two parcels.

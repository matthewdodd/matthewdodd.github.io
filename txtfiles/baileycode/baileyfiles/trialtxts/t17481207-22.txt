            . I am the centinel; I took the Prisoner near White-hall, this was on October 4. he came to me about a quarter after nine o'clock.
Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the person?
Hallocks. Yes, my lord.
Q. What did he say, when you took hold of him ?
Hallocks. He said it was his own; then he said, a man gave him six-pence to carry it; he was very abuseful : So I put him in my box, and set my bayonet against him, till I sent for relief.

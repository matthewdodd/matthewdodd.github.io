. On the night of the 29th of March, Jenkins gave me information. I ran out and overtook some boys about a hundred yards round the corner, and the prisoner was among them. I held him till Jenkins came up and said he was the man who took the meat. I missed a leg of veal which hung at the door five minutes before.

            . I work for a bricklayer. On the 29th of March I saw the prisoner come out of Peacock's shop with a leg of veal; he gave it to another lad who ran out with it - the prisoner then put on his shoes, and walked as if he was lame. I went in, and told Peacock; then followed, and found him at the back of the buildings.

                           Charles 
                           Churcher 
                        



                      
                   did burglariously break and enter, and stealing 40 yards of woollen cloth called Wilton cloth, value 6 l.

               receiving the same, well knowing it to have been stolen

                  Churcher 
               



            . I never saw the prisoners till I saw them before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; my partner 
               
                  Richard 
                  Griffin 
               



             first missed the goods mentioned; then we observed a pane of glass taken out of the window, and the cloth mentioned in the indictment, which had been lying near the window, was taken away; we went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and had hand-bills dispersed about; the next morning I went to Monmouth-street, and asked at shops if any body had been about with such cloth to sell; I was informed there had been a young fellow offering such to sell, and the person could know him again; and if he saw him he said he would secure him, which he did the next morning, and let me know. I went; we took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , there he confessed the fact, and said there were three of them concerned; he is admitted an evidence, his name is Blackmore, he gave an account of a Jew; we had an order from Sir John to go after him, but he has slipt away, and we cannot find him.

Q. Can you sell the time the goods were taken away?
Churcher. They were taken away about half an hour after seven o'clock in the evening, on the 18th of March; I came in soon after that time and they were gone, and they were lying there but a little before, there were 40 yards of it.
Q. Where does your partner live?
Churcher. He lives in Drury-lane; he is not here.


                  John 
                  Blackmore 
               



            . About half an hour after seven o'clock on that Wednesday night, Leach and I went to the prosecutors window; he broke the window, and took out a piece of white cloth, it measured 16 yards and a half; he gave it to me, and I went away with it, and in the mean time he took out two more pieces, and brought them to me; then he went and fetched another piece. I went to his house, then we went and took all the cloth down to Mrs. Nursey's shop; we offered to sell it her at 9 d. a yard, she would not buy it; we sold her a little bit that was cut off from a piece for 13 d. 1/2, then we went home to Leach's house, and staid there all night; the next morning Merrit took the cloth, and sold it to a Jew for 18 d. a yard; we had 1 l. 17 s. for it, and drank two or three pots of beer together.
Q. What is Merrit?
Blackmore. He is one of our gang; he has been tried two or three times; but he was not with us when we took the cloth.
Merrit. I am a watchmaker by trade, I never was tried here.
Blackmore. It was at Hicks's-hall; he once was an evidence here.
Mrs. Nursey. The evidence, and a person like the prisoner Leach, came to my shop, they offered me this small piece of cloth; (produced in court.) It was then wet and dirty; I then took it to be flannel; I bought it of them; after that they produced more, I refused buying any of it; I then suspected it was not honestly come by, and was sorry I had bought this piece.
Court to prosecutor. Look at this cloth.
Prosecutor. I believe it to be part of the cloth that was stole from us; I have compared it, and it agrees with the pattern.
Leach's defence.
I never saw Merrit in my life, till before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; as for the cloth I never saw it.

                  Parn 
               



            . I accidently dropt in here, and the prisoner Leach calls upon me to give him a character; I have known him from a child, his father and mother were very honest people, but I have nothing to say in behalf of the prisoner.
Merrit's defence.
This evidence Blackmore, was evidence against me at Guildhall Westminster, about some china, but he could not say any thing against me; he told Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he never saw me and Leach together; I never saw the cloth in my life.

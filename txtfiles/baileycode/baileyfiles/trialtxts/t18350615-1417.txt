WILLIAM SHEATH
. I am in the service of James Brown, a linendraper, in High-street, Shadwell. On the 10th of June I was in the window, and observed three persons outside, pulling a piece of print from a rail, which goes from inside the shop round the door-post—I watched them—they drew it off, and I saw Proctor conceal it under his dress—they all three walked off—I ran after them—Middleton was one of them—they all three acted together in pulling it down—I pursued them to the next door and collared the prisoners—Proctor let the piece of print drop—I held them till assistance came—Proctor tried a good deal to get away—this is the print—it is my master's property.


Proctor. Q. Did you see me touch the print? A. They were standing close together, all three pulling it, and the third one looking in at the door, to see that nobody noticed them—I am quite positive both the prisoners pulled it.





JAMES PORCH
. I am a policeman. The two prisoners were given into my custody at the prosecutor's shop, with the print.

Proctor's Defence. I was coming from the West India Docks, and was looking in at Mr. Brown's window—another person stood at the door, quite a stranger to me—I had not been there half a minute before a gentleman came and laid hold of me by the collar, and I asked why he collared me—he said he would let me know—he hauled me into the shop, and sent for a policeman, and told him to take the print which laid at Middleton's feet.

PROCTOR.—


GUILTY
. Aged 22.

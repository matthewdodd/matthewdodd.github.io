            . I am in partnership with 
               
                  Edward
                   Chandler
               



             the elder, and 
               
                  Edward
                   Chandler
               



             the younger. On the 10th of August I received information from a woman that I had been robbed at several times of some cloth, such as we cover coffins with; on the 11th I got a constable and examined; I had no suspicion of the prisoner before; he had been porter
 to us ten months; he owned he had stole the cloth and gave it to 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Smith
               



            ; I took them both before a magistrate; they took me to Mr. Shields where they sold the cloth; the man confessed he stole the cloth and gave it to the woman to sell. I found it at Shields's; it is remnants; there are five pieces in all. Shields said he knew the woman very well. (The cloth produced).
Prosecutor. I believe it is mine, I cannot be positive; I believe the baize to be mine; I have some hundred yards of it.


                  Benedict
                   Shields
               



            . I am a piece-broker and trimming-seller; the woman prisoner brought the cloth to my house and sold it; I gave her 2 s. 3 d. a yard for it.
Prosecutor. It cost me 4 s. 6 d. a yard.
Shields. They are remnants which are less valuable: they brought it in the middle of the day or else I should have been suspicious of them. I heard the woman ask Mr. Chandler to be merciful to her; I do not remember her confessing it.

Stiles Jones. Mr. Chandler gave me charge of the prisoners; they both confessed the stealing of it, and gave me directions to go to Shields's, where it was sold.
Davis said nothing in his defence.
Smith's Defence.
I did not know it was stole.
Q. to the prosecutor. Did you make him any promise, if he did confess?
Prosecutor. I told him I would forgive him if he would confess every thing, but there is a number of things lost he would not confess to.

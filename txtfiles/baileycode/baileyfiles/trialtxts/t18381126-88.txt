 and

 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
15th of November, 1 coat, value 1l. 10s.; 6 oz. weight of mutton, value 4d.; 3 knots of line, value 3d.; and 1 pencil, value 1/2 the goods of 




Thomas Aldred: and that they had both been previously convicted of felony.






THOMAS ALDRED
. I am a bricklayer. I was at work in Oxford-mews, Edgware-road, on the 15th of November—my coat hung on the joist in the first floor—I was at work within ten or fifteen feet of it, with fifteen bricklayers—I had two mutton chops in the pocket of it, in a piece of the Dispatch newspaper, and three knots of line, a pencil, and a memorandum book—I saw it safe half an hour before it was missed—I have not found the coat, but the chops were found on Laurence, wrapped in the same paper as I lost, and the pencil and line on Daley—I do not know the prisoners.





JOHN SALTIR
. I live in Oxford-mews. On the 15th of November I was opposite this building, and about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning I saw the two prisoners standing at the foot of the ladder—I went down stairs to fetch some coals, and when I came up the prisoners were gone, and the coat too, which I had seen on the joist just before.





RICHARD ROADKNIGHT
. I am an officer. I received information from Salter—he described the prisoners' dress, and another who had been with them—I found them together in Chapel-street—on Laurence I found the chops, wrapped in a piece of the Dispatch newspaper, and the line and pencil on the other.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





ALFRED BLUNDELL
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of Laurence's former conviction from the office of this Court—(read)—I was a witness at his trial—he is the man who was convicted.





MICHAEL BROWN
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of Daley's former conviction—(read)—I know him to be the man.

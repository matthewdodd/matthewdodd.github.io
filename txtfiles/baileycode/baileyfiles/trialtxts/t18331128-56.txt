             (policeman R 193). On the evening of the 9th of November, I saw the prisoner in Cheapside


; he put his hand into Mr. McFarlane's pocket, and took out a snuff-box; it was near five o'clock in the evening; he took it from his hind coat pocket, and put it into the flap of his trousers; I took him, and took his hand out of his trousers witht he snuff-box in it.
Prisoner. Q. Do you swear positively you saw me take it - I did not take it from the gentleman; I heard something fall, and picket it up, and he took it from my hand? A. I saw him take it, and his hand was within his trousers with the box in it.

            . I live at No. 21, Friday-street. On Saturday, the 9th of November, I was in Cheapside - Dyke tapped me on my shoulder and said my pocket was picked; he produced the snuff-box, and I recognised it; it had been in my coat pocket - this is it; I have used it for six months; I am quite satisfied of it; I had used it within half an hour.

            . He had another young man with him - I had watched them some time; I am sure the prisoner's hand took it.
Prisoner's Defence. Another young man was taken with me; the policeman said he had watched him for a quarter of an hour, and had seen him put his hand into three gentlemen's pockets; it was not this officer, but another, the Lord Mayor discharged the young man.

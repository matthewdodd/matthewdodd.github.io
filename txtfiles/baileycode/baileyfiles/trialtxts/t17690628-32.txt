            . I live in Woodstreet, Cheapside. I think I can swear those two pieces of ribbon are of our manufacturing. (Holding them in his hand.)

            . I am servant to the prosecutor, in Woodstreet, No. 5


. The prisoner at the bar came in, pretending to buy goods. I saw him privately convey one of these pieces of silk ribbon from out of a drawer, on the 8th of this month, in the afternoon, into his breeches. I searched him in the shop, and took it out of his breeches.

            . I keep the tap in Woodstreet-Compter. I was sent for to the prosecutor's shop. They told me the prisoner had stole some ribbon. I saw the witness here take one of those pieces from the prisoner; and I took the other out of his hand behind him.

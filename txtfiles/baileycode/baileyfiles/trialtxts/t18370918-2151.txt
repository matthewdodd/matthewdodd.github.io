ANN JONES
. I am the wife of Christopher Jones—we keep a cheese

monger's shop, in Ratcliffe-highway. About three o'clock, on the 8th of September, the prisoner came and asked for change for a shilling—I drew the till out to give him change—he asked me if I would oblige him with a new sixpence—I said I did not think I had got one—he raised him self up, put his hand into the till, and took out three half-crowns—I caught hold of him, and kept him across the counter—I took two out of his hand, and the other he put under a four-pound weight—there was a young man going by; I called him, and kept the prisoner till I went round and got an officer—he said if I would let him go he would never do the like again.

Cross-examined b
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You were on one side of the counter, and he on the other? A. Yes—he struggled very hard, but I held him till the young man came in—there was no new sixpence on the left-hand side of the till where he took these half-crowns from—he put his hand down, and said, "There is one"—I caught hold of his hand, and said, "you young rascal, what have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing, ma'am," and then I took the half-crowns from his hand.





RICHARD BANKUM. I
 am a police-constable. I took the prisoner.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

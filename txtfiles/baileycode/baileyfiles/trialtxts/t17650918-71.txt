            . My husband took the prisoner home in order to take him apprentice: he went with us before the Alderman: I did not in the least imagine he was guilty of any thing; he went to be a witness; there he confess'd, that Davis told Barrow, if they did not get him to do something as bad as they, he would blow them; that they made him drunk, and then he took silver and halfpence out of the till.

            . I saw the prisoner take 5 s. 6 d. out of the till on the 1st of August; and on the Wednesday following he took 3 s. 6 d. more.
Q. Had you us'd to give him liquor?
Barrow. No; we have drank a little liquor together: he saw Davis come down into the cellar to take liquor away, and Davis told me he would give him some liquor, that he should not tell.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take any money.

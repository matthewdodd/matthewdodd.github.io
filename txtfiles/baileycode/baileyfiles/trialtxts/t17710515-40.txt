            . I am a servant to Mr. Webster. I pitched my basket at the corner of Stationers Court; I took a three-penny loaf out and went into Warwick-court; when I came back my basket was gone. I ran down Stationers-court, down Ludgate-hill, and into the Old Bailey. I saw the prisoner with my basket; I did not know him before; it had ten quartern loaves, and three-penny ones in it. I laid hold of his coat and desired he would pitch the basket, he did and struck me on the breast, and I fell backwards. I laid hold of the basket and saved the fall; he ran away and I run after him, and cried, stop thief, a gentleman stopped him, he said he was running for a wager; the people told me there was a constable, to whom I gave him in charge.
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the basket by way of mistake. I thought it was another persons, a young man's in Watling-street, one Mr. Hill. I have not been in work above three weeks since January last. I am a baker by trade. I intended: have gone into the country if I could not have got work.

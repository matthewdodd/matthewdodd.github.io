WILLIAM HENRY BAIN. I lost a boar and sow from a field opposite my house, in West-street


; I turned them out there about three o'clock in the morning, and missed them at half-past three; they were found on the prisoner's brother's premises, behind the Lamb public-house, in Camden-gardens, Bethnal-green, about half-a-mile from my house.

            . I saw the two pigs in Helen's-place, behind the Blind Beggar public-house, on the 12th of September - the prisoner was driving them; he was alone, and said to me, "Drive them back;" he then drove them into the road again; I said, "Where did you get them?" he said he had bought them - I knew him before, and am certain of him; I saw the same two pigs again at Simpson's, and knew them to be the same.

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; he said he did not drive the pigs, but only threw a bit of dirt at them - he said he lived in Collingwood-street, but did not know the number and who kept the house; I went there, but could find no such person.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and saw the pigs; I only threw a stone at them, and then went to work.

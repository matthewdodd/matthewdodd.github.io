THOMAS GARDENER. I am a hosier
, and live in Whitechapel


. On the 18th of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I served the prisoner with a number of articles. While I was calling them over, to see if they were right, I missed a silk handkerchief, and told him perhaps he had put it in his pocket by mistake; he said he had not; my son took off his hat, and found a pair of drawers in it, which I had not missed. We found the rest of the articles stated in the indictment concealed on different parts of his body.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

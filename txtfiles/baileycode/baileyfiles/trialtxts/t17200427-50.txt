, on the 22d of March
 last. It appeared that the Prisoner and another Man went into the Fountain Tavern in the Strand


, had Wine, Veal-Cutlets, and Small-Beer in a Silver Mug; that they were going away without paying their Reckoning; but the Drawer looking into the Room mist the Mug and secur'd the Prisoner, who offer'd 5 l. to make up the matter. The Prisoner in his Defence said he thought the Man that was with him (who he said was a Stranger) had carry'd the Mug to the Bar and paid the Reckoning. But the Jury not believing him, found him 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

            . On the 6th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I had these things in a cart. I went into a shop for an errand, an alarm was given that my bundle was stolen from the cart which stood at the door. I went out and saw the prisoner with it in his hand, and kept him in sight till he was stopped. He then dropt it, and it was picked up and given to me.

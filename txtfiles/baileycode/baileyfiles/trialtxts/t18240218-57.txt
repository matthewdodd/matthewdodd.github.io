            . I am a single woman, and servant to the prisoner's father
, who has the charge of a sugar house in Christian-street. On the 19th of January, between two and three o'clock, I went into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner; he caught me round the neck, and struck me in the face - I struggled with him, made an alarm, and got from him. Some people came, but he had then got away. We found him concealed in a large box in the counting-house, with some wearing apparel and my watch; I saw his father take it from him. It was safe in my bed-room at three o'clock that afternoon.

            . I found the watch on my son about four o'clock - I was in search of him for an hour and a half. He said he would give up all he had got.

            . I am a constable. I took him in charge for stealing his father's property, and this watch. I asked what his intentions were; he said to secure the woman, and get away with the property he had taken.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

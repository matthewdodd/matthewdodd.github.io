            . On the 18th of July I was in Mr. Reynold's shop, in Whitechapel


; I felt a pull at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner behind me with my handkerchief hanging out of his side pocket - I took hold of him, and took it from him.

            . The prosecutor came into my shop, and was paying for some goods; the prisoner came in, went behind him, opened his pocket with his right hand, and with his left I saw him put the handkerchief into his own pocket; I came round the counter - the prosecutor then had hold of him, and I gave him in charge.
Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop on the Saturday night; this gentleman was standing at the counter with his handkerchief half out of his pocket; I said,"Your handkerchief is hanging out." Mr. Reynolds was selling bacon, and he wanted to pretend that I wanted to steal some, but I did not; and then the prosecutor said I wanted to pick his pocket; and when before the Magistrate he told the gentleman to say I wanted to take it out of his pocket.

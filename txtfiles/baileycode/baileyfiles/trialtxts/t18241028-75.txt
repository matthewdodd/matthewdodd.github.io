            . I live at No. 19, Norton-street, Fitzroy-square. On Saturday, the 23d of October, I was coming down Titchfield-street about half-past nine o'clock - there was a fire in Margaret-street


 - I went to it, and as I was going through the crowd. I felt a person press against my back. I turned round and found I had lost my handkerchief. I saw the prisoner running, and went to him, took him by the shoulder and found it in his hand, about three yards from the spot where I had felt the pressure - it had been in my outside coat pocket. I took it from him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was with Mr. Barton. I did not see the prisoner till Mr. Barton had lost his handkerchief. I was before him in the crowd, he called me when he had hold of the prisoner. I assisted him in taking him to the watch-house; he said he was very sorry, that he had never done so before, and never would again.
Prisoner's Defence. I went to see the fire, and as I was coming back, two big boys came by me and put the handkerchief into my hand - I thought they were in fun.

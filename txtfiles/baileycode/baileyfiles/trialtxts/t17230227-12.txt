             depos'd, That the Prisoner brought the Goods to her House, and that the Prosecutor claim'd them there, this was also confirm'd by another Evidence. Amy Scriven own'd the Fact. The Jury found her 


               guilty of the Felony, to the Value of 39 s. but acquitted her of the Burglary
            ; but there not being Evidence sufficient, against George Bennet, and Mary Wall, they were 

               acquitted
            .

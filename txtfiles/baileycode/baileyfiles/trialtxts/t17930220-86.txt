I was servant to Mr. 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wood
               



            , he is a broker
, No. 82, Fore-street


. On the 30th of January I saw the prisoner just stand out at the door about half after four, with the clock under his left arm.
Q. Where had that clock been before? - I cannot tell; I did not see him take it; I immediately ran to my master and called him from the other house, and my master and the man ran after him; I am sure the prisoner is the man, he was not brought back again, he was taken to the Compter.

             sworn.
I have a broker's shop in Fore-street. On the 30th of January, about half past four, that young body came to me; I was about two doors from where the robbery was, and told me that a man had taken a table clock out of the shop; I keep two shops, and there is two private houses between; I immediately runs to see whether the clock was gone; I ran back to fetch one of my porters to assist me to try to take him; it stood about six yards from the door inside of the house; I asked the servant which was the man? she shewed me; my porter's name is 
               
                  Thomas
                   Gregory
               



            ; the prisoner went along Fore-street, my porter and I ran the other side of the way, in order to have a view of the side of the way that he was, and I saw him about fifty or sixty yards distance, with the clock under his arm; we both ran as fast as we could and took it on him; my man took it and I was close at his elbow; we took the clock of him, and took him to the Compter.
(The clock produced.)

             sworn.
I am porter to Mr. Wood, the 30th of January last, which was the Wednesday afternoon, the maid came and gave the alarm, and said, that a man had taken the table clock; I pursued him and I catched him partly opposite Baldwin-street, in Fore-street; I catched him with the clock under his left arm; I put my hand over his left shoulder, and seized it by the ring, and then took hold of him afterwards by the collar; for fear he should let the clock fall.

             sworn.
I am a marshalsman; I saw Mr. Wood and his man running; I came out of Basinghall-street at the time; I joined the pursuit; Mr. Wood's man laid hold of him and I immediately went up and took possession of the prisoner; I saw Mr. Wood's man take the clock from him and I have had it ever since. (The clock deposed to.)
Prisoner. I was going down Fore-street and a man stopped me, asked me to carry this clock; I had not carried it any way hardly before Mr. Wood's man stopped me, and asked me where I was going with it? I immediately turned round and saw the man was gone; I don't know as I have any witnesses; I have witnesses to my character I believe.
Court to Wood. How far did you pursue him? - Near a hundred yards; there was a lad with him, who was taken to the compter and who afterwards was proved before the alderman to be his brother, but the property not being found on him he was discharged.
The prisoner called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.

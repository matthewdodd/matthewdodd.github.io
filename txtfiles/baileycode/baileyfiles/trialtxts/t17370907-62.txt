            . Burge's Wife the Day she was robb'd fetched me to her House, and charged the Prisoner before me, with robbing her of two Handkerchiefs; she owned the Fact, and told us she had sold them for 2 s. to a Man and his Wife in Montague-Court. We went to these People, but they would not return them unless we would repay them the two Shillings which they had given for them. However, the Man came with us to the Prisoner, and d - n d her for a Bitch; and the Prisoner told him in our Hearing, he had had enough of her already, - and what he had received from her was sufficient to nail her.

             spoke to the same Effect.
Prisoner. I sold the Handkerchiefs to this Mr. Hare's Wife; she gave me 18 d. and the Husband gave me 6 d. they told me if I would bring them twenty, they would buy them; I think they are as much to blame as I am, and ought to be sent away along with me.

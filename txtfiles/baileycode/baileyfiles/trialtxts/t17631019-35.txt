            . I live at Deptford


, the prisoner lodged at my house about half a year, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name) last Wednesday was a week, the prisoner was missing at the time, I took him on Saturday last.
Q. Do you keep a public-house?
James. I did, but do not now. I found the watch pawned at the Three Golden Balls, in the Minories, to 
               
                  John 
                  Green 
               



            , I have the gown again, it had been pawned, and was brought to me.
John Green. I am a pawn-broker, and live in the Minories, I believe the prisoner is the man that pledged this watch with me, (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I asked him how he came by it? he said he bought it of landlord at Deptford, in Flaggon-row.
Prisoner's Defence.
This man has been guilty of a great many more faults than I have, in robbing seafaring men. I kept company with a woman in his house, she was not my lawful wife. He turned me out of the house when I had no money left, and after he found there was money coming to me, he took me in again. Necessity drove me to do what I did.

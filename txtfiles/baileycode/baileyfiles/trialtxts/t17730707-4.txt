                     Mary
                      Chappell
                  



               
            . I am the wife
 of 
               
                  
                     Abraham
                      Chappell
                  



               
            , who lives at Winchmore hill, in the parish of Edmonton: my husband is a day labourer
. On the 8th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was going towards Tanner's End


; I was in a field near the highway, in the common foot path; 
               
                  Sarah
                   East
               



             and 
               
                  Mary
                   Chappell
               



            , my husband's sister, were with me. I met the prisoner in the field; when he came up to us; he said ladies you must stop here; upon which I asked him for what; he said he was in necessity, and money he must have, and would have by G - d; he held up a short clubbed stick to my head; I told him I had no money; upon which he replied again he must have money, or something else; which he explained to be monies worth; upon this I put my hand in my pocket and took out three-pence farthing; I held it in my hand; but before I had delivered it to him, 
               
                  Sarah
                   East
               



             turned about, and said, here is Joe coming; she and 
               
                  Mary
                   Chappell
               



             had walked away on the prisoner's coming up to them, and had got off, being much terrified, about the distance of forty yards; upon that he snatched the money out of my hand and ran away with it.
Q. Are you certain to the person of the prisoner?
Chappell. Yes: it was broad day light, ten o'clock in the morning, and I saw him go past my door about half an hour before I met him in the field. I had seen him three or four times before, but I never had any conversation with him in my life.


                  Sarah
                   East
               



            . I was with Mrs. Chappell on the 8th of May: a man came up to us; I do not know whether it is the prisoner; I saw him stop Chappell; I went on before; he said you must stop here ladies. I did not see him rob her; I was frightened and ran away.
Q. What had he in his hand?
East. I did not see any thing that he had in his hand. I turned about, and cried, here is Joe a coming.
Q. What distance was you from the prisoner?
East. About forty yards.
Q. Did you ever see him before?
East. Not to my knowledge.



                  Mary
                   Chappell
               



            . As I and 
               
                  Mary
                   Chappell
               



             and 
               
                  Sarah
                   East
               



             were going over the field, a man met us, and said, ladies you must stop here. I do not know the man; I never saw the man before I was with Mrs. East; when she said here is 
               
                  Joe
               


             a coming, then the prisoner went away; whether he ran or walked I cannot tell; I was frightened.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not meet these three persons. I was at a house; I went by the house they live in; I asked there for work; she told me, John, I have none; I had a pint of small beer given me. I followed these three persons; when I came into this field I did not know what to do, for I had not a farthing nor a bit of victuals; I pulled off my hat, and said, ladies, I must beg a trifle of you if you please; I asked in a civil way; I told her I was in a great necessity; I had no stick, only a little bit of a swish.
For the Prisoner.

            . I have known him almost two years before this: he always bore a good character; he got his bread very honestly; he has been drove to great distress; he came of a very good family. I searched into this affair; I went to this woman's house, the prosecutrix's, and she told me no farther than this, that he met her and asked her benevolence, pulled off his hat and asked her civilly, and she gave him threepence halfpenny, and told her if he had not been very poverty struck he should not have asked her.

             has given the Court an account of the conversation that passed between him and you relative to the robbery.
Prosecutrix. It is not true: what I said to him I have said to you now.
Q. to Knight. What are you?
Knight. A shoe-maker by trade: I live at Enfield.




               Guilty of stealing the money, but not guilty of the robbery

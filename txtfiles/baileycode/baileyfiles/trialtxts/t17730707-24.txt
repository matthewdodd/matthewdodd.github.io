            . I am servant to Mr. Jones: on the 19th of June. I had a cask of gin in a cart; I stopped a little below Half-moon-alley in Bishopsgate-street


, and stood on the other side of the way to watch it, because I had been robbed thereabouts before; I saw the prisoner come and take it on his right shoulder, and went away off with it towards Shoreditch; I followed him and asked him where he was going with it; he said he did not know; I told him it was my master's property, and brought him back with it.
Q. What was in the cask?
Haslem. About five gallons of British gin.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found it in the street.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.

            . I am an officer. On Sunday the 9th of May I stopped the prisoner in Petticoat-lane, between seven and eight in the morning. I found upon his person two pewter quart pots; they were squeezed flat. The direction upon them are, William Coppard, Red Lion, Hack-bridge. He could not give me any account how he came by them.
Q. to Coppard. You keep the Red Lion at Hack-bridge; where is that - A. Near Casharton. They are my pots. I have seen the prisoner in my house; he worked at the oil mill. The last time I saw him in my house was the 3d of May. This pot looks like one of my last new pots.

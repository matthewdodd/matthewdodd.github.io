            .
JAMES TOOK. I am servant
 to Mr. Clutterbuck. On the 7th of October I was following the soldiers in St. James' Park


; Morgan spoke to me - I did not understand him, and walked on; I afterwards found I had lost my handkerchief, which was safe just before I got to the Palace. I afterwards received information, and found it at Bow-street; I had not observed the prisoner near me.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in the Park on the 7th of October, noticing the persons following the soldiers. I saw the prisoner Miles press close against Took, and Wilson pressed close to him; I saw Miles take a handkerchief out of Took's pocket, and hand it to Wilson, who put it into his breeches pocket; I seized him, took it out of his pocket, and Morgan secured Miles, without his getting out of my sight.(Property produced and sworn to.)
MILES' Defence. I was following the band - a parcel of boys were running; they said some boys were taken for picking pockets. I went to look at them, and the officer said it was me - I never saw the handkerchief.
WILSON'S Defence. I went to see the band, and picked a handkerchief up off the ground.
PHILIP PARISH. I had been watching them for five minutes, suspecting them - I cannot be mistaken.
MILES - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.
WILSON - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.

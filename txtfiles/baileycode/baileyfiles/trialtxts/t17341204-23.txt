.
Mr. Nunes. I took the Prisoner for an Errand-Boy
. I went out on the 9th of October, but had not been gone long before I was sent for home. My Wife told me that the Boy was gone, and the Goods missing. As I suspected he would endeavour to go over Sea, I sent Letters to Gravesend, Dover and Harwich describing him, and advising to stop him; and at Harwich he was taken by Mr. Booth, a Constable, who brought him and all the Goods to London.


                  John 
                  Booth 
               



            . Having a Warrant to apprehend the Prisoner, I took him at the Bridle-House in Harwich; I found the Goods upon him tied up in the Tail of his Shirt. The Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

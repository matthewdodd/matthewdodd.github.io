            , who has premises in Three-Fox-court, St. Sepulchre's


 - he does not live there. On the 10th of July the officer fetched me there; I found part of the lead stripped from the gutter of the roof; it appeared fresh cut; about 3 cwt. was stolen; they produced 18 lbs., which fitted the cart shed.

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 8th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner in Three-Fox-court, in a ruinous place by the cart-shed - he had a trowel in his hand, and was spreading some dirt. I asked what he was doing, he said nothing, but moved off. I immediately kicked against the dirt, and found the lead secreted under it. I followed and overtook him in Long-lane; he begged to be let go, and said he did it through distress. I found a knife on him, which had marks of lead on it. I fitted it to the roof.

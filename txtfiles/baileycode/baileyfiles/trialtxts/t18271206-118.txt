            . I am house-keeper to Mr. Henry Philip Reeve, who lives in Liverpool-road, Islington


. On the 30th of October I was in the back parlour, and heard money rattle - I instantly got up, and saw the shop door about a foot open - it was shut when I sat down; I looked round, and saw the prisoner in front of the flour-bin, laying at full length, with the till out, just under his nose; I had seen it safe a quarter of an hour before; he had taken it out, and put it on the floor: he said two boys had opened the door, and told him to come in, and they would give him a shilling if he brought the till out, and he had crawled in on his hands and knees; there was 3s. 3 1/2d. in it.

                  Elizabeth, wife
 of 
                     
                        Henry 
                        Titchbourn 
                     







            , was indicted for 


               receiving the said silk, well knowing it to have been stolen
             by 
               
                  
                     Mary 
                     Peck 
                  




                
            , October 1

The record of the conviction of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Peck 
               



             was read in court, wherein was mention'd, that she confessed the fact, was order'd to be branded, and was branded accordingly.


                  Mary 
                  Peck 
               



            . I stole these two bobbins of silk from 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Lewin 
               



            , and sold them to the prisoner at the bar, who said it was very fine, and fit for her business, and ask'd me when I would come again. Last Saturday night she sent two men to me, who wanted to persuade me that Mr. Chandler offer'd to give me a guinea to b uy me a new gown, to swear I sold it to her.
Q. What is the prisoner?
M. Peck. She works upon an engine, and her husband weaves silk handkerchiefs.
Q. What did she give you for it?
M. Peck. She gave me a shilling a bobbin for it.
Q. What are the two bobbins of silk worth?
M. Peck. They are worth about a crown.
Q. Did she know, at the time she bought them, that they were stolen?
M. Peck. I told her they were not my own.
Q. Did you tell her whose they were?
M. Peck. No; but she guess'd it.


                  Joseph 
                  Chandler 
               



            . I deliver'd a parcel of bobbins of silk to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Lewin 
               



            , and when she brought it home there was a considerable deal wanting; I told her if she had been rob'd, and would endeavour to find out the thief, I would endeavour to do her justice. She came after this and said she had received intelligence of the two bobbins. I went and got a warrant, and search'd the prisoner's house, where we found abundance of bobbins of divers gentlemens, some in one place, and some in another; amongst which were two of mine. ( Produced in court, with silk upon them.) These I deliver'd to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Lewin 
               



            . There were two looms, and variety of materials to carry on business in a clandestine way; they keep no open shop, but, we are informed, they have sold goods for ten years past.
Q. What are these two bobbins of silk worth?
Chandler. They are worth about six shillings.
Q. What is 
               
                  Mary 
                  Peck 
               



             ?
Chandler. She is a doubler of silk.
Q. Is she in such a way of business, that she can be mistress of two bobbins of silk?
Chandler. No, not to come honestly by it.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Lewin 
               



            . I am a doubler. I had thirty bobbins of silk of Mr. Chandler, to draw them into silver silk. I lost two bobbins of it. I had mark'd them, and they were found again at the prisoner's house. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Peck 
               



             own'd in my hearing she took them out of my room.


                  John 
                  Chapman 
               



            . I am a constable. I search'd the prisoner's house, and found several bobbins of other persons, among which were these two that the prosecutor has sworn to.
Q. to E. Lewin. Look at these two bobbins, do you know them?
E. Lewin. These are the two bobbins and silk upon them that were taken out of my room.


                  John 
                  Benington 
               



            . When 
               
                  Mary 
                  Peck 
               



             was in custody, she offer'd to go to the prisoner's house, and sell her another bobbin for a shilling, to convince us she did receive and buy stolen silk. We deliver'd a bobbin of silk of another person's to her. I went with her, and staid without. She went in and came out with a shilling in her hand, and had left the silk there, which I have great reason to believe the prisoner bought.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am not guilty of what is alledged to me. She never told me they were not her own, neither did I know the silk was stolen.



               Guilty

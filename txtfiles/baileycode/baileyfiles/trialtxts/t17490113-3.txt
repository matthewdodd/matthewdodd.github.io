            . I am a linen-draper
 the prisoner came to my shop the 6th of Jan. she ask'd me to see a coarse handkerchief of about 10 d. price; these handkerchiefs lay just behind me, and while I was turn'd round to reach them down, she took a remnant of long lawn; I miss'd it, but she was just gone; I followed her, and took hold of her, and found by taking up her cloak, it was under her right arm.

            . Dec. 30
.
Hen. Jackson. On the 30th of Dec. I lost out of a little cupboard 9 different remnants of gold lace, 170 l. in cash; to the best of my knowledge there were 120 guineas and the rest Portugal gold, one bank note payable to one Lefeavor.
Q. How do you know it was the prisoner at the bar that took those things?
Jackson. He was my near relation and servant; he told me the 30th of Dec. he would stay no longer with me, and went away about half an hour after 8 that morning: my workmen after he was gone told me they had seen him with more money than they thought he could honestly come by, of late: then, after missing these things, I got a relation to go to take him, who found him in Cheapside; I was sent for, he confest the fact, I put him in a coach, and he carried me to a Jew who keeps a little buckle-stall under the Baptist's head 21alehouse, Holborn; there I found all the money within about 12 pounds; the Jew took the money and note out of a box.
Q. Have you any of the money here or the note?
Jackson. No, my lord, the prisoner said he was very sorry for what he had done.



               Guilty
             of Felony except the bank note.

JAMES FLIGHT
 (police-constable B 128.) I was in a pawnbroker's shop, on the 27th of Dec., and the prisoner came in with these things—when she went out I followed her, and asked her how she came by them—she said she lived in Sloane-street, and her mistress sent her to pledge them—I went with her to Sloane-street, and she then said her mistress was not at home—I said, I should take her to the station—she then wished me to take them and let her go.

Prisoner. They were given me to pledge.

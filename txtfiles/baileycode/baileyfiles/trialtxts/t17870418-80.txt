             sworn.
I know the prisoners only as to the driving of the carts of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Scott
               



            , Esq. of Hoxton; these two men were driving these two carts; they were loaded with coals; I saw it; they came down Old-street


, and their carts were coming along; there was a dust-cart belonging to Mr. Hand's opposite to me; there was a couple of large baskets, which I believe they call bushel baskets; Shaw took the baskets out of the dust-cart; the servants followed him; he called out, bring them baskets back; he said, I must pay a pot of beer; out came the master, and bid him return to his work; Mr. Hands followed these two carts, with the two drivers, the prisoners; they stopped at the White Hart, Old-street, the corner of Bunhill Row; they went into the public house; they staid about ten minutes; the baskets were left at the outside of the door; Shaw carried these baskets into this public house empty; the prisoners returned out of the public house; the little one got into the cart nearest the public house; Shaw stood at the tail of the cart; him in the cart handed out a great large coal; the other, Shaw, received it, and handed it into the public house; they proceeded again for some time; then they got into another cart, and handed it as they would hand bricks; they staid some trifle of time, and they came out to drive their carts away; Hand's man went into the White Hart, and brought out a large basket full of coals; he carried it up into his master's premises, into the yard; there was a large coal in the basket; they call them large bushel baskets; the servant returned without any basket, and went into the White Hart; he came out with another basket loaded with coals, but not so high piled; I suspected them; they stopped to take in some timber; I thought I would follow them, to see who the carts belonged to;when I came there, I saw they belonged to Mr. Scott of Hoxton; one was 21,000, the other, 12,508.
Court. When did Hand's servant join them again, or how? - I cannot say; I saw Hand's servant go into the public house; the same servant.
Court. Where did you stand to see all this? - Looking out of the window, as I generally do, after I have eat my dinner.
How far from your window might this White Hart be? - It lays to the left visible enough to distinguish, with the windows open, into the tap room; I saw both the prisoners employed in it.

             sworn.
I am clerk to the brick-kiln at Hoxton; the prisoners drove teams that day for Mr. Scott; they went out in the morning; I ordered them to fetch coals up; they were Mr. Scott's coals; it was on Wednesday week, I think, each of them were to bring a load of coals from White Friars to Hoxton, from a yard that belongs to Mr. Scott.
PRISONER LARNEY's DEFENCE.
I was in the public house; I never saw any thing of the coals.
PRISONER SHAW's DEFENCE.
I went and had a slice of bread and cheese; we had a pot of beer, and went out again directly.
The Prisoner Shaw called one witness, who gave him a very good character.

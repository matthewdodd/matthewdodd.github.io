            . I am a pewterer, the prisoner pretends to be one; I live in Shoe-lane; the prisoner came to me last Wednesday night; he had brought three pots to my man, which I had seen the names on, and I had ordered them to be put by; I shewed him them, at first he denied that he brought them, but when my servant said he would swear he was the man, he acknowledged he brought them; he said, he bought them of a person that was offering them in the streets; then he said, he bought them of a broker in Swallow-street; I went, and found but one in the street, and he said, he never sold a pot in his life; I found, he has worked as a labourer at a pewterers; I took him before Mr. Alderman Crosby, there he begged he might be sent to the East Indies (three pots produced in court.)

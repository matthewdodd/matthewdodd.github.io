. On the 29th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was at breakfast in the parlour behind the shop; and saw the prisoner in the shop - he opened a slide in the window, and took this piece of handkerchiefs off the top shelf - and went out; I followed and gave an alarm - he was brought back to me, and I took them from him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking by the shop - a young man tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me to carry the parcel for him - and told me to put it in my apron; there was a cry of Stop thief! he ran, and I ran too - but lost him.

On the evening of the 26th of January I was going up St. Martin's-court, and met the prisoner with a coat; he went very quickly down St. Martin's-court, and gave it to another man - I followed the prisoner, thinking he was going to meet the other man again; I saw him go into the prosecutor's shop - I put a witness to watch him, who called me, and I saw him come out with this coat on his arm.

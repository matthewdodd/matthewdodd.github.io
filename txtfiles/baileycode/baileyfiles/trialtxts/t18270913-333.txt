            . I am a rope-maker. On the 17th of August, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I saw Patterson take this lead off an empty house in Star-court


, and put it in at the window. I did not see any other person.

            . I live at a public-house near St. Katherine's Docks. On the 17th of August I saw Patterson take the lead off the top of the house, No. 9, Star-court; he said to me, "Go round, and see if you can see any body;" I said, "No, I will go and see if I can see any body to take you;" I told Sitgrave.


                  WILLIAM 
                  SITGRAVE
               



            . The house this lead was taken from was in possession of the St. Katherine Dock Company. Harragan came and told me he saw the lead taken- I tried the front door, and could not get in - it was bolted - I ran round to the back door, and saw the two prisoners about fifteen yards from the back door. I secured them both; Patterson said I was no officer, and should not hold him; if I let him he would walk quietly; I let go, and he ran away - I followed, and took him; I went on to the house, and found this piece of lead doubled up in the parlour. I compared it with the top of the dormer - it fitted exactly; Woodyer was there, but did nothing.
PATTERSON'S Defence. I was not in the house at all - I was going to work; this man came and asked if I had seen the master come down.
PATTERSON -

            . I am a solicitor's clerk
. On the 2nd of October, about half past nine at night, the prisoner Harvey spoke to me, and desired me to go home with her. I went with her to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane


. I only staid with her in the passage for a minute, and I pulled out my watch to see what o'clock it was, and she snatched it from my hands. I gave her nine shillings to give it me back again, and she did. I had scarcely placed it in my fob again, before the other prisoner came through the passage and snatched it out. I immediately pursued him, and he ran into a house of ill fame; afterwards he was taken by the watchman, but no watch found upon him.

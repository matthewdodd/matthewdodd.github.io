            . On the 23d of April, coming under Aldgate


, between the hours of four and five, the prisoner came near me. I felt him at my pocket. I turn'd about and saw him convey my handkerchief under his coat. He was secured, and my handkerchief found upon him; but as I put it out of my pocket at home, and having other of the same pattern; I can't swear which is it. The prisoner said a boy gave it to him.
Q. When did you see it last?
Berkenhout. I had it in my hand but about a minute before.
Prisoner's defence.
Another lad took the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and gave it to me; he was clear'd here last sessions.

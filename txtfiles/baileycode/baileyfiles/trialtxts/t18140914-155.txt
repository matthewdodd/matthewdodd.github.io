            . I live at Wapping. On Friday, the 9th of September. I observed the prisoner coming out of a warehouse, where Mr. Burgess's porters were landing linseed; I had in the early part of the day seen the same man go across the wharf; shortly after, I saw the prisoner go across the wharf, and by his dirty appearance, I did not think he belonged to Mr. Burgess's porters. I asked the prisoner whether he belonged to the gang of porters; he said, yes. I let him pass, and shortly after, I saw him come from the warehouse; in coming from the warehouse I observed us he passed me, his jacket pockets full; I touched it, it felt soft. I informed Mr. Burgess's foreman; he took his jacket off. This is the jacket; there is a peck of linseed in each pocket.
Prosecutor. We had such linseed as that in our warehouse.

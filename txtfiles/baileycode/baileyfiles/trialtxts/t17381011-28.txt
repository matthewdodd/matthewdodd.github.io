.
Edward Backhouse, The 4th of this Month, in the Evening, I lost 9 pair of Worsted Stockings out of my Shop-window, worth about a Guinea. I did not see the Prisoner take them, but I saw him go out with them, and I pursu'd him, and took him with them under his Arm; but when I laid hold of him, he dropp'd them. He seem'd to be surpriz'd when I took him, and did not say any thing at all. When the Constable came, he was carry'd before Mr. Justice Martyn, and there he did not directly own the Fact, but he said, he had liv'd honestly ever since the last Time he was acquitted.
Prisoner. When you took the Stockings under my Feet, were not other People about the Place?

Mr. Backhouse, I believe there was none but the People who might then happen to be going by; when I first laid hold of the Prisoner, he had them under his Arm.

            . I was in the Shop, and saw a Man take the Stockings out of the Window, but I don't care to swear to the Prisoner, upon the little Sight I had of him; but when I saw him take them, I called to my Husband, and he pursued him and took him, and brought him back with 9 pair of Stockings. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.

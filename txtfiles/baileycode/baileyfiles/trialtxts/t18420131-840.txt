JOHN BENNETT
 was again indicted

 for feloniously and knowingly uttering, on the 
27th of January, a forged order for the delivery of goods, with intent to defraud 



Richard Moser the elder, and another.






WILLIAM MORRISS
. I am a yard porter to Messrs. Moser. I know the prisoner by sight—I am positive of him—he brought me this order on the 27th of January, and asked me to look out the steel for him—I said, "Your people are using a great deal of steel, and you tell young master Dry to be more careful in his writing; he is getting a worse scholar now than before he went to school"—the prisoner said young Dry was a bad scholar—I selected the steel in consequence of the order, weighed it, and our yard clerk had it to enter, and gave him the invoice—I am positive he is the man—I delivered the steel to him, helped him tie it up, and he took it away on his shoulder—it was under 56lbs.





JOHN BILL
. I am clerk to the prosecutors. On the 27th of January the prisoner came, I ticked this order, and gave him the invoice—it came to 2l. 11s. 6d., weighing 2qrs. 91bs.—be took it away on his shoulder—I noticed the order at the time—it was signed "J. Dry," which Mrs. Dry generally signs.





JEMIMA DRY
. This paper is not my writing, nor my son's—I never authorised anybody to write it—my son is not in the habit of drawing these orders, and if he did, he always signed my name as well as his own—I always sign Jemima in full.


Prisoner's Defence. I met a man at the Marsh-gate, who said be would give me 2s. to go and get this steel, while he went to see somebody down the New-cut; I went and brought him the steel; he gave me 2s.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.
(There were five other indictments against the prisoner.)

Before Mr. Justice Cresswell.

ROBERT WARD. I am a sawyer
, and live in Kingsgate-street, Holborn


. On the 19th of May I had some pieces of mahogany on my premises, which are under a cabinetmaker's shop; I opened the premises at half-past six o'clock that morning, and lost this piece of mahogany a quarter before seven; I saw the prisoner about ten yards from my premises with it; I went to look if I had lost any; I was hardly certain, but I went after the prisoner, and took him in Red Lion-square; it is my property, and is worth about 6s. - he was quite a stanger to me; I asked him to take it back again to where he took it from - he tried to throw it on my toes; I caught it, and put it on the iron rails.

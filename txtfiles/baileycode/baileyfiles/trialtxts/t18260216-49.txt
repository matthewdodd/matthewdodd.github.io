            . I am errand boy to Mr. William Hart. I received a parcel containing three hats and three bonnets, from Mr. Samuel Halls, one day last month, to take to my master's; I met the prisoner, whom I knew, in Union-street - he had been in Spital-fields school with me - he asked me to go to a dye-house in Duke-street, for him, and he would give me twopence, and mind my bundle; I said, "Never mind the twopence, I will go for nothing, but why can't you go yourself?" he said he had cut the boy's head with some glass, and he did not like to go; I went to the place which he described, for some kno's of silk, but there was no dye-house there - when I returned he was gone, and my bundle too - this was on a Saturday, he was taken on the Monday.

            . The parcel was mine - I had paid for it at Messrs. Hall and Son's, Cripplegate.

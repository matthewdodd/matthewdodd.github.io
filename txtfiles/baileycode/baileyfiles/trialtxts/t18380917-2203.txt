CHARLES STUDZINSKI
 (through an interpreter.) On the 6th of September I put my coat on a table in a public-house, between seven and eight o'clock, and lost it. This is it-(looking at it)—I did not see the prisoner.





ROBERT ZOTTO
. I live in Broad-street, Golden-square. A little alter seven o'clock, on the night of the 6th of September, I was passing up Port-and-street, I saw the prisoner turn her back, and put something up her clothes—I kept her in view till she dropped the parcel—I followed her some distance, and gave her in charge—the policeman took up the parcel—it proved to be this coat.

Prisoner's Defence. I was outside the public-house—a woman gave me the bundle, and told me to take it—I was not in the house at all.




GUILTY
.* Aged 48.—


Transported for Seven Years.

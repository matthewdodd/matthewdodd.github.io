            . I am a constable of Lincoln's Inn. In my way through Rolls-buildings, a little before nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in company with another person. I watched and saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's house, and come out again in about a minute. I went through the Yorkshire Grey, public-house, and he passed me. I followed and stopped him, took him into a hair-dresser's shop, found the tea-pot under his coat, and in his pockets a silver cream-jug, sugar-tongs, and spoon. The other ran away.

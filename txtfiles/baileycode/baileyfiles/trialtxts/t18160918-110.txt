JOHN THORN. On the 16th of August, about half past eleven at night, I was coming home from St. John's-square, and a woman come rushing up against me, and I said, you have drank enough, mistress, hold up. I observed her person and her fare well; it was the prisoner. I was close by my own door, and in going up stairs, I put my hand in my pocket, as is a custom of mine; and I missed my money; it immediately occured to me that the prisoner must have robbed me. I went out, and called the watchman, and had the prisoner apprehended; and on her we found the money, and I could swear to one of the three-shilling pieces by two small TT on the neck of the head side.

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th of December, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was near Kingsland-gate, about one hundred yards from the Tottenham-road, and met the prisoner on my beat carrying a bundle, about two hundred yards from Mr. Rowe's building - I asked what he had got, he said some lead which he had found in a field near my box - I took him to the watch-house; I saw the same lead fitted to a building - it matched exactly with the lead left on the top.
JOHN ROWE. I have a building in the Tottenham-road, Hackney


 - Page informed me some lead had been taken from my building - I went, and saw it matched, and it fitted exactly; it was nailed to the gutter the day before.

            . I am a beadle. The watchman brought the prisoner to me with about 40lbs. of lead. I afterwards saw the lead fitted - it matched exactly.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to look for flints, and saw this lead in a ditch. I showed the gentlemen where it had been, but they would not take any heed of it.

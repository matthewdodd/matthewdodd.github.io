            . On the afternoon of the 27th of February, I was walking in Piccadilly


, with 
               Mr. Ogermand
            -he was behind me - He told me my pocket had been picked. I missed my pocket-book, containing a 5l. note and a ring, which were safe a few minutes before. I turned round, and saw it falling on the ground, and Mr. Ogermand with the prisoner.

MR. OGERMAND
            . On the 27th of February, I was with Mr. Cox - He was a few paces before me; I observed the prisoner and another man close behind him. One of them lifted the tail of Mr. Cox's coat, took the book out of his pocket, gave it to the prisoner, and ran away. I collared the prisoner, and he threw it down. I am positive the prisoner is the man.

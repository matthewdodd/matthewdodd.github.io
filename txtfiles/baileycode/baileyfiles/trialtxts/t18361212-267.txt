JOHN FORSTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



Richard Gustavus Hancock, from his person.






RICHARD GUSTAVUS HANCOCK
. I live in Great Ormond-street, Queen-square. At a quarter before six on the evening of the 5th of December, I was in Drury-lane—I left a twitch, and my handkerchief was gone—I turned, and seeing the prisoner putting his hand behind him, I collared him, and accused him of having it—he denied it, and said he saw a boy running away with it—I said I did not believe it, and should give him in charge—I still stood with him, and would not let him go—after some time he acknowledged it, and produced it and said, "Let me go"—this is my handkerchief—it has my mark on it.


Prisoner. Q. Where was I standing?—A. Behind me—you did not give the handkerchief up at first.





HENRY GRISS
 (police-sergeant, F 16.) I was called, and took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in Drury-lane, and a boy with a blue coat picked the gentleman's pocket, and threw the handkerchief on me—the gentleman collared me, and I gave it up directly—I did not deny it.




GUILTY
.*—Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

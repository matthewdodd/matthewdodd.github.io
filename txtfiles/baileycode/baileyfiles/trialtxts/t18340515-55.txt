            . I am shopman to Mr. John Burgess, a pawnbroker
, in Old-street Road


. On the 6th of May, I heard a snap at the shop door - I went round and saw the prisoner in company with another person - the prisoner was in the act of tucking this waistcoat (which had been hanging inside our door) into his apron or under it - I went out - he saw me and threw it from him - he ran off - I pursued and took him.

            . I was near the shop, and saw the prisoner with two other lads, between nine and ten o'clock- they walked backwards and forwards by the prosecutor's shop for twenty minutes - the prisoner went by himself two or three times, and touched the waistcoat, then returned to the other lads, and when he found an opportunity, he went to the waistcoat and snatched it down - he was going towards the others when Bird came out - I saw the prisoner throw down the waistcoat, and run off - he was then taken.

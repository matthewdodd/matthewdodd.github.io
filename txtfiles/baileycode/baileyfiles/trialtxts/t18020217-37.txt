               James
             M'Coull, in Clifford's-inn-passage, a gold watchcase, and other articles, but not the box; they are in the possession of the officer.

Mr. Alley. Q. How do you know that; from your book, or your own knowledge? - A. I know it both from the book, and my own knowledge; that box, on its arrival, was checked off in the book, and was left in the warehouse till the Monday morning, which is usual; the next morning, the Bath articles were called over to me by one of our porters, and this box was put into what we term Mattocks's bin; Mattocks is the porter, who works into the city.
Q. Do you know if he is ever assisted in delivering parcels, by a person of the name of Spencer? -

Q. 
            When was your recollection first called to this box? - A. On the Tuesday afternoon.
Q. To whom did you deliver that box to be delivered to Mr. Smith? - A. I cannot say, it is called off "a box, Smith, Bunhill-row;" there are two porters, and I cannot say which of them it was.

               A. 
            No.

Q. 
            Do you recollect a parcel directed to Mr. Charles Smith, No. 118, Bunhill-row? - A. I do; I took it in a cart as far as St. Paul's Church-yard, and then I delivered it with other parcels to a boy of the name of 
               
                  James

                  SPENCER
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect having any parcel from Mattocks, directed for Mr. Charles Smith, of Bunhill-row? - A. Yes, a little deal box; I took it till I got just beyond Whitebread's brewhouse, the prisoner at the bar came up to me -
Q. What time of the day was it? - 
               A. 
            Between twelve and one, he asked me whether I was going to Mr. Smith's -
Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On the Tuesday; I told him; he said, you young dog, why did you not bring it before; I told him I could not conveniently bring it before, for it came in but last night; he said, I know better than that, for it came in yesterday; says he, I have not money enough now, you must bring it here; going along Bunhill-row, he said, I have got money enough now, and gave me two shillings, I gave him four pennyworth of halfpence in change; he then went as far as the first pair of gates up Bunhill-row, on the left-hand side of the way; there was a parcel of women, he talked to them upwards of a minute, and as I had been served such a trick when I was a school-boy, I followed him up as far as Mr. Smith's court; I crossed over to the court, and saw the gate shut too after him; then I thought I had delivered it right; I charged one shilling and eightpence for the carriage, but it was not the proper charge; I got as far as the India-house, and then I found I was wrong; I went back to Mr. Smith's to rectify the mistake, and they told me no parcel had been there; I saw the prisoner again on the Friday following, at the office in Hatton-garden; there were thirteen or fourteen together, and I picked out the prisoner; I am sure he is the man.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it that you have been quite sure the prisoner is the man? - A. When I saw him at Hatton-garden.
Q. No, you were not, I was there, you know? - A. I did not know him when I first went in, till they desired him to stand up.
Q. Did you not say, at the last examination, that you were not quite certain, but you believed he was the man? - A. I did not say so, I was always sure he was the man.

Q. 
            Your master, I believe, has threatened to dismiss you, if the prisoner is not convicted? - A. No, he has not; he was angry with me for giving him so much trouble.

Q. 
            What time of the day was this? - 
               A. 
            Between twelve and one.
Q. There is no thorough fare to this court? - A. There is a thorough fare through the court, but none through the yard.
Q. Can you read and write? - A. Yes; I was in St. Bride's charity-school.
Q. To whom was the box directed? - 
               A. 
            To Mr. 
               
                  Charles 
                  Smith
               



            .

Q. 
            When the man came up to you, he had not had time to read the direction? - A. No; he came up, and asked me if I was going to Mr. Smith's; I had four other parcels beside Mr. Smith's, that I brought from the yard, and he might have seen the directions when I was untying the parcels at a door.

Q. 
            Has it happened that you have been in Newgate yourself? - A. No, never; I was locked up three hours in Worship-street, because they said I was connected with the man.
Q. Was not your father taken up by a warrant? - A. No; he heard of my being taken up, and he came to me, but he never was detained.
Q. Did you give a description of the person who took the box from you? - A. Yes.
Q. You had been walking about two or three days to find him out? - A. No; I went one day through all the little courts and alleys to see if I could find him.
Q. When you went to Hatton-garden, did not the officers tell you the prisoner was the man? - A. No; they turned me into the room, and I picked him out.

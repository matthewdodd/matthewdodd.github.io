            . I was a servant to Mr. Stratford in January last; I was housemaid; the night before the twelfth of January last the house was broke open; they got in at the fore-kitchen window; there is an area before it; it was fast when I went to bed about ten o'clock; the things were taken off from the window, it was an outside shutter; I saw it about eight o'clock. Cannon had been servant to Mr. Stratford; he was dismissed the day after New Year's Day. 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             came for Cannon's cloaths that he had left behind him; we did not let him take the things as he had no authority there. Cannon came for his cloaths; and when he went I saw Siday stand at the corner of the street. The night before he went away he wanted me to let him go out to stay all night after the family were gone to bed; he came in about eleven o'clock. I was not to let my master know if I let him out.

                   Cornelius
               



            . I live with Mr. Stratford; when I got up on the twelfth of January, I was some time before I got into the room; I looked about and saw the press burst open; the mustard castor was split; and I thought the cats were got in. I remember I lock'd up all safe the night before. I took the key out and found the lock was broke open. I missed the plate. I was much surprised and went into the street hall. I saw Mr. Stratford's closet door; I believe he always keeps the key; I saw the hall door open; I shut the door; I saw the housekeeper's door open, and the plate chest was burst open; the window in the area had the sash burst open and the cords were hanging to it; the hinges on one side of the shutter were broke; when I came down I saw some specks of wax about the hall. and some dirt, which had not been there over night. I had been there but ten or eleven days when this affair happened. I had the care of the press in the hall; I had two pint silver cups, four salts, four shovels, two castors, a sugar and mustard castor, a bread basket, half a dozen table spoons, a large scallop bowl, a soup spoon, and a long spoon, two small hand waiters, and two candlesticks, French plate; what were taken out of the housekeeper's room I don't know.

                   Chamberlayne
               



            . When this man came down and alarmed the house, I found it as he expressed; they had not been in the kitchen; I found every thing in my room but the plate; the plate were, as near as I can recollect, a coffee pot, two pair of candlesticks, two cases of knifes, and there was a great deal more plate. I never saw 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             till he was taken. I never had any conversation with Cannon about this; he came into Mr. Stratford's service at Bath.
Q. from the Jury. Did you see any matches or signs of candle burning?
Chamberlayne. There was a wax candle in the housekeeper's room; and there was something of a link or flambeau burnt that had dropped all over the floor-cloth; and there was part of a wax candle in the room that was not there before.
The Hon. Mr. 
               
                  Edward
                   Stratford
               



            . I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock. I understood and believed the house was locked. My servant came in the morning and alarmed me. I endeavoured to save my wife and the women servants; the maid servant went down stairs. I followed her soon after. I found my door was forced open and every thing of consequence was gone; I set forth a number of things in the indictment upon recollection, but I have lost many other articles that I cannot recollect (all the articles in the indictment severally read, which Mr. Stratford deposed to.) I took the prisoner Cannon into my service at Bath: he seemed very desirous to come to live with me for fear of being pressed. I discharged him at London on the second of January, I think; he came in very much flushed with liquor; I never keep a servant that does so; therefore I discharged him immediately. He hired himself to me by the name of John; I have heard his real name is Luke.
Q. Do you remember losing a picture?
Mr. Stratford. Yes; the French king's picture: I have it in my pocket (producing it).

                   Levi
               



            . I bought some things of them. I buy and sell old cloaths. 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             called me up stairs at his lodgings in Seacoal lane on Monday the twenty-first of January; there was 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             and Cannon and Siday's wife, and another young man was along with him; which he said was his brother; but that he knew nothing about it; they shewed me a parcel of cloaths; Siday shewed me the things; I bought them: there was a velvet suit of cloaths. I delivered them up to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . They shewed me a flesh coloured coat and breeches; Mr. Stratford has that coat on now. I bought three or four; and I bought the blue waistcoat Mr. Stratford has on.
Mr. Stratford. Sir John returned my cloaths to me.
Levi. Cannon was in the room at the same time; there was a silver kitchen, a silver bread basket, &c. as far as I could see they were all broke to pieces.
Q. How much do you think there was?
Levi. I bought six hundred and fifty ounces. I paid for seven hundred ounces.
Q. Who did you pay for it?
Levi. I paid Siday forty-five guineas at first, and a 60 l. note. Cannon took the note from me. I paid upwards of 170 l. in all with the note. I paid it to Siday, and Siday gave it Cannon; they were both present when the money was paid; some I paid to one, and some to the other. I sold the plate to Lazarus Jacob's son.
Q. What business is he?
Levi. There was three of them; one was grinding stones for seals, and another engraving.
Q. Do you know his person?
Levi. I believe that is the young man; I am not sure; pointing to 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            .

Q. Sir, have not you declared positively that you delivered some of the plate to the son; and that Lazarus Jacob was present at the time?


                  Joshua
                   Leigh
               



            . I think not.
Q. When you sold the plate who paid you?
Leigh. Lazarus Jacob's son.
Q. How many different times did you go with the plate to Lazarus Jacob's son?
Levi. Three times.
Q. Did you never see the father?
Levi. Yes, once; he was at supper.
Q. Who did you give the plate to?
Levi. The son.
Q. Where was the father?
Levi. He was not in the room.
Q. Had you no conversation with the father then?
Levi. No.
Q. Did not he know what you came about?
Levi. No.
Q. How many ounces did you sell him?
Levi. Six hundred and fifty.
Q. How much did he give you an ounce?
Levi. Four shillings and ten pence; a good deal was not worth four shillings and six pence.
Q. The plate was unmelted at the time?
Levi. Yes.
Q. Did not you go to Lazarus Jacob for more money?
Levi. No; I never spoke to him about it.
Q. Did not Jacob Jacobs shew you a bar of silver?
Levi. Yes.
Q. The young man at the bar?
Levi. I believe it is him.
Q. What did he say?
Levi. He said it was a bar of silver.
Q. Did he not tell you what it was made out of?
Levi. No.
Court. Why was some of it not worth four shillings and six pence?
Levi. A great deal was not sterling; it was uncertain silver.
Q. Which?
Levi. The buttons were not.
Q. How much might all you call uncertain silver amount to?
Levi. I can't tell.
Q. Did you sell any gold to 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            ?
Levi. Yes; a gold snuff box; two seals, broke to pieces; a head of a cane and a gold button I believe.
Q. These you had of 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



             at the same time you had the silver?
Levi. Yes.
Q. Was that standard?
Levi. I believe some of it was French gold. I gave three pounds and sold it for three pounds again. I lost thirty shillings by it; there were several suits of cloaths and two pair of pistols which I bought of Cannon and Siday.
Court. Did they say how they came by them?
Levi. No.
Q. Was the bars of the kitchen broke?
Levi. Yes; and the cock was broke off.
Q. Did you see any coat of arms or crest engraved upon it?
Levi. I believe there was; but I can't read or write.
Q. How came you to make this discovery?
Levi. Saunders came and said, if I wanted two or three hundred pounds he would give it me; he would lay it out for me; I was a little in liquor; I went with this man to a public house; he was to shew me some diamond buckles, and all the while they were nothing but paste. I went to a public house; he told me to stop there for a moment; when I came back from the public house Cannon and Siday would not give me the buckles.
Q. Who is this Saunders?
Levi. I don't see him here.
Q. How came they to take you up?
Levi. I told Saunders, and he discovered me. I never saw the diamond buckles; I saw the rings; they shewed me one pair of paste, which they said were diamond buckles, and three diamond rings; I believe there were nine in all.
Q. What did you give for the plate?
Levi. Four shillings an ounce.
Q. from the Jury. You are certain you bought it of these two men?
Levi. Yes.
Q. Both were acting together about it?
Levi. Yes.
Q. How often have you seen them?
Levi. Two or three times.
Q. You had seen Jacobs as often as them?
Levi. Yes; I have known him twenty years.
Q. Then you must know him very well?
Levi. Yes; I know him by sight very well.
Q. As they were not diamonds, describe them?
Levi. There was one large ring, and one diamond ring; then there was another they told me was a diamond one; and there were two mourning rings and a plain ring; I believe there were nine in all in a little case.
Q. Should you know them again if you saw them?
Levi. Yes.
Mr. Stratford. (producing a case sealed up.) These were sealed up at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; they have not been opened since.


                  James
                   Taylor
               



            . I took these out of 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



            's bureau when we took him up; (the case is opened ) these are the rings.


                  Joshua
                   Turner
               



            . I sealed these buckles up. I had the contents at Mr. Glannon's; (a shirt buckle shewn Levi.)
Levi. This I believe is what Siday had.
Mr. Stratford. This is my property.
Q. from Siday. Whether he ever saw Cannon in my room at the time these things were delivered to him?
Turner. Yes.
Q. from Cannon. Whether he ever saw me more than once?
Turner. Yes.
Cross Examination.
Q. I think you say five weeks.
Turner. Five weeks last Monday.
Q. You say you went to Jacob's house on Monday?
Turner. Yes.
Q. Did you go any other day?
Turner. No; I went three times that day.
Q. What business is 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            ?
Turner. A lapidary I believe.
Q. Did Jacobs deal in plate?
Turner. Yes; twenty years ago he did.
Q. Are you sure it was 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



             you saw? you say there were two or three in the room?
Turner. There were two or three in the room.
Q. You say you was much in liquor; are you sure it was Jacob's son you sold the plate to?
Turner. I thought so.
Q. But you are not sure; you said so I think before the justice?
Turner. Yes.
Q. How came you to be taken up?
Turner. Through my own foolishness.
Q. Who stopt you?
Turner. One Saunders; they frightened me out of my senses; and said I should be hanged or transported if I did not charge somebody else; so I charged 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            .
Council for the Crown. Who told you so?
Turner. Saunders.
Q. Did not you desire to be admitted an evidence for the crown?
Turner. No.
Council. It is not five minutes ago since you told the jury that you was apprehended, and therefore you made the discovery; is what you swore then and now the truth?
Turner. Yes.
Q. Was it the truth that you swore then?
Turner. To be sure; I was frightened.
Council. Then you never tell the truth but when you are frightened? Is what you have sworn now the truth?
Turner. Yes.
Q. from 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            . When did he bring the plate to me?
Turner. On Monday five weeks.

                   Bond
               



            . On Wednesday the sixteenth of January, about seven in the evening, I was sent for out of this court by one Saunders a Jew; I had been speaking to him of Mr. Stratford's robbery a little before; I told him there was in particular a large diamond ring; he said he had just been offered the diamond ring; he took me to a public house in the Old Bailey; I went and stood at the corner of the house whilst he went in; he came out with 
               
                  Moses
                   Levi
               



            ; I took hold of him by the coat and took him down the Old Bailey; he was very desirous to know what was the matter; I took him in a coach to Sir

            's; I searched him and found a handkerchief, that Mr. Greenfield has since owned, which contained a quantity of gold and silver lace; he gave an account who the persons were of whom he had the lace; he said they were Cannon and Siday. I can't be particular whether he said he had the plate of them; he said he had the plate of John and 
               
                  William
                   Siday
               



             and Cannon. He was asked what he had done with the plate; he was not ready to own that; at last he said he had sold it to Jacob's father and son; he then took me to Seacoal Lane; he knocked, and somebody answered; he knocked a second time and said it is me; then Cannon let him in; he was standing in his shirt: I jumped at him and threw him on the bed. Saunders had told me that it was dangerous; so I thought it best to be as expert as possible; he had only his shirt and breeches on. I saw a man tumble out on the other side of the bed; I called out to them that were with me, that a man had got out, and had got under the bed; that was 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



            ; Siday's wife was in bed; she continued still; we, after some struggle, tied their hands, and began to search the rooms; in the bureau, the key of which Siday had in his pocket, I found this box with a lady's picture in it.
Mr. Stratford. This is my box; and there was a medallion of the French king and my wife's picture in another part.
Bond. I found this table spoon among some linen in a drawer; there is Mr. Stratford's crest upon it. In a closet where they keep coals, I found these two silver sockets for candlesticks (producing them.)
Mr. Stratford. Here is my crest upon one of them.
Bond. In Siday's pocket I found these pair of silk gloves on the bed.
Mr. Stratford. These are what I believe I bought at Paris; they are like them.
Bond. These three pair of pistols (producing them) I found in the room; two-pair belong to Mr. Wallace.
Mr. Stratford. The other pair has my crest on them.
Bond. All the pistols were found at 
               
                  Levi
                   Jacob
               



            's: he told me he had purchased these pistols. I found all these chissels in a drawer in the room (producing a number of large chissels) where Siday and Cannon lay.
Mr. Stratford. Here is a knife in the drawer that I can swear to; it is a particular one.
Bond. I found five loaded pistols in the same drawer. The Jew then told us who he had sold the plate to, namely, Lazarus Jacob's son. I went and took them both. He said Lazarus was present one of the times he went there.
Q. from Cannon. If I was without shoes and stockings?
Bond. Yes.

                   Taylor
               



            . On the sixteenth of January last, I went with Mr. Bond to Siday's door (he confirms the account given by 
               
                  Nicholas
                   Bond
               



            .) I found a key in Siday's pocket; he said it was the key of his bureau. I found this case (producing a case with several instruments.)
Mr. Stratford. All these things are mine.
Taylor. Here is a silver box broken (producing it.)
Mr. Stratford. This is the box the picture was in.
Taylor. Here is a pair of knee-buckles, and one shoe-buckle (producing them) which I found next morning. Here is a bullet-mould, and brace of balls, and two powder-horns, with powder in them; these, I believe, were their own. There is likewise a pair of topaz buckles that Mr. Stratford has got. Mr. Noakes was with me next day: he took out of the bureau a pair of gold weights and scales.
Q. What is Siday's business?
Taylor. He said he was a printer.


                  John
                   Noakes
               



            . I went with Mr. Taylor to Siday's apartments, and found these scales and weights for silver, and these small ones for gold (producing them.)
Mr. Stratford. I had a pair of gold weights and scales like these.
Q. Do any of you know what is become of that bar of silver?
Taylor. We delivered it to 
               
                  John
                   Siday
               



            ; they said it was tooth and egg.
Q. There was some money found upon them, I believe.
Taylor. Twenty-seven guineas on Siday, eleven and a half on Cannon.
Q. How large was this bar?
Mr. Stratford. It weighed a pound and an half.

                   Leigh
               



            . On Friday the 18th of July, the day after Mr. Stratford was robbed, Mr. Stratford called, and desired Mr. Turner, who is partners with the prisoner Glannon, might be enquired of by Sir John, to see if he could find any of Mr. Stratford's property. From Mr. Turner's account, it appeared that his partner Glannon was the principal acquaintance of Cannon. Mr. Glannon was sent for; he said he had left a box there. Sir John sent me with Glannon to his house: he carried me through the shop into a kind of back warehouse close by the door: he scratched up the earth (the place had no flooring) to about five or six inches, and then took out this box (producing a box sealed up.) It is now sealed with my seal. He had told Sir John that there was a box; and he told me, I think, as we were going along, that there was a pair of buckles ( Opens the box, and produces a pair of diamond buckles and a drop.)
Mr. Stratford. These are mine; the buckles contain just the same number of stones that I had given notice of.
Leigh. Mr. Glannon took these knee-buckles (producing them;) they were tuck'd in at a cavity between the board and the wall; they are not diamonds.

Q. Were they concealed?
Leigh. They were so far concealed, that I told Sir John, when I came back, that if I had gone with a warrant to search the house, I should not have found either the one or the other. I asked Glannon whether that was all Cannon had left with him; he several times said, Yes, it was.
Q. from the jury. Did he say he received them himself from Cannon?
Mr. Stratford. He said Cannon and himself had hid them there.
Glannon. I said I saw Cannon do it.
Cross Examination.
Q. I think Mr. Stratford desired Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             to enquire of Turner; who is he?
Leigh. Partner with Glannon. Turner was sent for, and he said he had a very slight acquaintance with Cannon, which was merely by his partner, who had formerly been in partnership with Cannon.
Q. Glannon came voluntarily, without a warrant?
Leigh. There was no warrant.
Q. And mentioned these buckles at once?
Leigh. I can't tell exactly: he told Sir John, Cannon had been there either on Sunday or Tuesday, or both: I don't recollect whether he said one or both; and he said he had left a box there.
Q. Did he say anything of Cannon's having taken a lodging at his house?
Leigh. No; he mentioned him with a kind of indignation. He said, that when they were partners before, Cannon went from him, and owed him money. He spoke at first of Cannon as being an unworthy man, that he did not chuse to have connection with.
Q. Did he tell you he was coming to give information to Sir John, if he had not been sent for?
Leigh. I did not hear any thing of that kind.
Q. I think you say he said he was present when the buckles were hid?
Leigh. He said, Cannon and he hid them. He said, as to the knee-buckles, Cannon had made him a present of them for himself.
Q. Did he tell you how long they had been had?
Leigh. Either on the Sunday or the Tuesday: it was on Friday that Mr. Stratford was robbed. Cannon came there on Sunday or Tuesday, and then they hid these buckles.
Q. Did not he tell Sir John he was then coming to give information?
Leigh. No.

                   Turner
               



            . I found these things the Friday after Mr. Leigh was at our house. I went to see Glannon in prison; he told me where there was a breast-buckle in the back shop; I went and found it according to his directions.
Q. Where was it laid?
Turner. On the top of some bricks, against the wall.
Q. Was it in a concealed place?
Turner. Yes.
Q. Do you know any thing of a bank note being found?
Turner. The night Mr. Glannon was in prison, he told me there was a sixty pound bank note in a window in the back shop; I found it there.
Cross Examination.
Q. You say you found the breast-buckle by Glannon's directions?
Turner. Yes.
Q. Was that on Sunday?
Turner. No, on the Friday afternoon. I had been with him two or three times before that; he had been then a week in custody. The bank note was secreted in a bag of hair-powder.
Q. When he told you of this breast-buckle, did not he tell you he had forgot it when he was before the justice?
Turner. No.
Q. What was you to do with it?
Turner. He did not give me any directions what to do with it: I took it to Sir John; he asked me to bring it down to him.
Q. Council for the Crown. Did he bid you bring the bank note to him?
Turner. Yes.
- Pentiloe. I am keeper of the prison. I had directions from Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             to go to Glannon's for a bank note. I sent Sir 
               
                  John
               


             a copy of it.
Turner. I carried it to Glannon at Sir John Fielding's office.
Council for the Crown. Did Glannon say where he had that bank note?
Turner. He said, in part of payment from Cannon. He said Cannon owed him twenty pounds; that he gave him that note to get it changed, but he had not got it changed.
Court. What is the date of the note?
Turner. The 12th of January.



                  Alexander
                   Grant
               



            . I am a carpenter and undertaker. On the day that Mr. Stratford came to town, I was sent for to put some window-curtains up. On the 26th of December, I saw Cannon in the house then, for the first time. I was in the kitchen at Mr. Stratford's. His late coachman and another man were going down to Tothil Fields Bridewell. I was going that way, and said I would walk with them. We all three went in and enquired for Cannon. Cannon was in the kitchen. We sat down with him, and called for some beer. Cannon drank with us. One word brought up another. Mr. Stratford's coachman was talking with Cannon, and Cannon told him several things that he asked him. He asked him what time they came in that morning; Cannon said, about two o'clock. He asked him how long they were in the house; Cannon said, they did not come out till almost seven. The coachman asked how many there might be in the house; he said, six, and every man had a loaded pistol. He said, it was a happy affair that Mr. Stratford's people were not alarmed; for if they had, they must have been all murdered. He said, that if Mr. Stratford would admit him principal evidence, he could impeach sixteen or more that were in the gang, and tell where every thing was.
Court. Did the coachman, or any body, persuade him to tell this?
Grant. Tomlin said, You may as well tell the truth; and if you can be admitted an evidence, you shall.
Court. Then you should not have made use of it, it is not right.
Q. Are you quite sure that Cannon had said nothing about this robbery before the coachman had advised him to be an evidence?
Grant. He did not say he was in the house when the robbery was committed.
Siday's Defence.
One Sunday, I can't justly tell the day of the month, my brother, and two more young men, came up to me before I was out of bed. I got up, and let them in. They brought in some things: they told me they had been helping a young man to move that was afraid of having his goods seized. He asked me to let him leave them: being my brother, I let him put them into the closet. The next day he brought out the things, and asked me to buy them: he said it was plate: I said I would. I weighed it with the weights and scales that are in court. The Jew came up to me; I asked him if he would buy it of me; he said, Yes. I sold it to him; he paid me the money for the plate and the cloaths. He asked me if I woul d sell him the diamonds; I told him, Yes. I asked him four hundred pounds for them; he said he would give it me. He brought Sir John's men, and took me to goal. Mr. Glannon knew nothing at all about it.
Cannon's Defence.
About three days before Sir John's men took me up, I met this 
               
                  Jack
                   Siday
               



             and his brother in Fleet-street. They asked where I was going to; I said into the country. Siday told me they were going to look for a room, and asked me if I knew any body that had a room to let; I said an acquaintance of mine had. I went with them to New-street, Covent-Garden; to Glannon's house: they gave him the box. At the same time he said he had four rooms to let backwards: I told him I had two friends with me that wanted a room or two. Glannon and they and I went backwards; nobody else was in the shop. They looked at the rooms, and agreed to give him 4 s. 6 d. a week for the two rooms. Somebody knock'd at the shop; Glannon came down, and we staid up behind. Upon our coming down, this Siday goes into the shed that is backwards; he was to have the use of it. Siday and his brother and I went in, I came out before them, and then they put the buckles, I suppose, in that place. That very night I came home to Siday's house; I was in liquor; he persuaded me to lie down upon his bed. I took off my coat and waistcoat, and laid down upon his bed. I had nothing upon my head, though Mr. Bond says I had a night cap. I slept two or three hours before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's men came. I was to go home to my lodgings: I lay at the Bull and Gate in Holborn. I got a coach and came along with them to his lodgings. Siday said, You know Glannon's lodgings; I have taken the rooms backwards, and my brother and I have planted these boxes in the back room: and send word, for God's sake, that he may not be hurt by them. We sent a note first, he did not come, I suppose he was not at home; we sent another messenger, and then Glannon came down. He told him that the buckles were put there by Siday and his brother; likewise that there was a pair of buckles in the shop that he had put in, and was to come to the lodgings two or three days afterwards. I believe Glannon knows no more of them than I do. I had not the buckles at all. I know nothing of the robbery further than what Siday told me. The lodging was for 
               
                  Wm.
                   Siday
               



            . My friends are all gone now.
Lazarus Jacob's Defence.
I say what the evidence himself says: I know nothing at all of it.

            's Defence.
I was out all day on the 14th of July with one 
               
                  Mordecai
                   Levi
               



            : he goes out with my father every morning. When he buys a parcel of clothes my father finds the money and gets the profit. He was to go out that morning to buy a bargain of clothes; my father desired me to go with him: I did go with this 
               
                  Mordecai
                   Levi
               



            ; we went all up Westminster and that way, till we came to Marybone; we bought some cloaths there for twelve guineas: he said I should have half the profit. We went and hawk'd about, and sold the goods. We went after we bought these things to St. Martin's Lane, about three o'clock; we staid there till between five and six: we found there one 
               
                  Moses
                   Levi
               



             and 
               
                  Isaac
                   Callinger
               



            . We went down to Rosemary Lane, Rag Fair, and sold the goods, and came home between nine and ten in the evening. I went out at eight in the morning, and did not return till between nine and ten at night.
Glannon's Defence.
The prisoner, Mr. Cannon, and two more young men came to me, and ask'd if I had got some rooms to let; I said I had several: I was at that time in the parlour: they staid about a quarter of an hour up stairs, looking into the room I suppose. I saw one of them with Cannon at the shed door: they were doing something there, what I did not know at that time. I was called into the shop to serve a customer. This Cannon told me after some time, that there had been something buried there; what it was then I did not know. I heard nothing more of it till Friday, then a person came to me with a note from Tothill Fields Bridewell. I went there: Cannon and Siday acquainted me, that they had just at the door buried a little case, describing it. My servant, Turner, acquainted me, that Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             had sent for me; I asked what he wanted with me; he said he did not know. I never sat down, but went directly to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's. Sir John asked me about the prisoner; I told him every thing I knew. He ask'd me if they had left any thing at my house; I told him so and so. I took the buckles up, and went to Sir John's; he committed me. I desired Mr. Turner to go home, and in a bag which contained hair powder he would find a sixty pound bank note: I sent for it that it might not be sold with a pound of powder. On the Friday following I had a boy came to me from Newgate with a letter to acquaint me that there was a shirt buckle wrapped up in a piece of paper on a shelf, and desired me to send for it. Accordingly the next time I saw Mr. Turner, I acquainted him that I had such intelligence, and bid him see if he could find it, to take it to Sir John's; and if he could not find an owner for it, to bring it to me. I am totally innocent of receiving these things knowing them to be stolen.

                   Jacobs
               



             on the 14th of January; last Monday was five weeks. I was at his house between eight and nine in the morning. I saw a lot of wearing apparel on the 11th of January in Marybone: I could not buy it myself; I had not money. I went to Lazarus Jacobs on Sunday, and told him of it; he said if I would call in the morning he would give me money, or go with me. Lazarus Jacobs was out, so Jacob Jacobs went with me: he said he must not trust me with the money, but must go with me, and lay the money out. He went with me to Castle street, and laid out twelve guineas for me. From there we went to an eating house in Chandois-street, St. Martin's lane, a cook's shop. We got there about two o'clock, or a little after two. We staid there till between five and six. First I eat my dinner, and then we ripped off the lace, and sorted the clothes. I saw 
               
                  Moses
                   Myers
               



            , I believe, and a christian there; I don't know his name. From this eating house we went to Rag Fair: he said he could not go home; he would wait an hour or an hour and an half. We came home between eight and nine to 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            ; it was after nine by that time we got home. I live in the same street he does; I came away from Jacobs' house a little after ten.

            . I am a Christian. I am a salesman in Rosemary Lane. I was at the eating-house in Chandois street on Monday the 14th of January. I went there to dine with 
               
                  Moses
                   Myers
               



            ; he is an acquaintance of mine, and deals in cloaths: I was to meet him there.

                  Mordecai
                   Levi
               



            ?
Callinger. I have seen him several times.
Q. Have you seen 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



             and Levi there?
Callinger. Yes, that day, together.
Q. What were they doing there?
Callinger. They were eating.
Court. Why do you remember it being the 14th of January?
Callinger. Because I had some business to do there with Mr. Myers.
Q. Did you know of the Jacobs being taken up?
Callinger. Not till I was subpoena'd.
Q. What had they with them?
Callinger. Some bundles; I cannot say what was in the bundles; I did not see them opened. I staid there an hour and a half, or two hours: I left them there: I came away between four and five o'clock.
Court. How long have you lived in Rosemary Lane?
Callinger. All my life-time.

Q. But you cannot tell his name by that; but you knew his name to be Jacobs: at the time you was at this place at dinner, you knew it was 
               
                  Jacob
                   Jacobs
               



            .

Q. Do you often meet this Myers about business?
Callinger. Yes.
Q. Did you ever meet him at this place before?
Callinger. Yes, once or twice.
Q. Can you tell the day you was with him before?
Callinger. No.
Q. Why not, as well as this?
Callinger. I did not take notice of it.

Callinger. Yes.
Q. Where?
Callinger. In a book.

             and his family.
Callinger. No; I only was known to Levi.
Q. Levi says he did not know the Christian there: did you speak to him?
Callinger. I cannot tell whether I did or no.
Q. How came you to be subpoena'd?
Callinger. Because I was in company.
Q. How did they know that?
Callinger. I cannot tell.
Q. Did not somebody talk to you, and ask you whether you was in company there or no?
Callinger. Myers asked me whether I remembered the day; and Myers told me the day I was there with him.
Q. So you did not remember the day Myers bid you bring that receipt?
Callinger. No.
Q. Where is that receipt?
Callinger. In a book at home.
Q. Had you any other conversation with Myers about it?
Callinger. No.
Q. Who gave you the subpoena?

Callinger. On Wednesday last.
Q. Could you tell what you was to appear for?

            . I am a chapman in Rosemary-lane. I was at an eating-house in Chandois-street on the fourteenth of January. Mr. Callinger and I had a little bananas together; and; and we had a mouthful of something to eat. I went in about two o'clock. I said till ale o five. I saw Jacobs and Levi there. I was sitting at the table, and had a bit of soft beet and potatoes. They had two bags with them. I did not see what was in them. I left them there. Mr. Callinger and I went away, and left them there.

Q. But the beef, or stewed meat, or whatever it was, did not stay upon the table from three till half an hour after five?
Myers. No.

Myers. Yes. We could not agree.
Court. What was it?
Myers. It was a pawnbroker's stock. We did not buy them, because they were too dear.
Court. Then there was no money paid by you to him?
Myers. There was a little bill, but it was not paid the same day.
Court. So neither of you received any money at all?
Myers. No.

Myers. Yes.

HENRY HAYS
. I am a jeweller, and live in Regent-street. I have a house at Picklewood, near Wilsden—I had employed the two prisoners as haymakers—I did not miss this property till the officer brought it to me—it agrees in appearance and number with what I lost.

Cross-examined by
MR. JONES. Q. Had you any other persons working for you? A. Yes—I suppose twenty—these glasses and tumblers were in the loft over the stable—there was a door to it, and a ladder to go to it—there was no lock—I cannot tell the day I lost it.





JOSEPH YOUNG
 (police-constable S 152.) On Friday morning, the 13th of July, I met the two prisoners on the road to London-Carter had a bundle at his back, and the other was with him, talking together—I asked what they had in their bundle-Carter said, "It is all right—it is all our own"—I said, "Let me see"—they were willing to let me look—I saw eight printed books first-Carter said his master gave them to him—the other said, "Yes"—I took them and the property—the prosecutor identified it.

Cross-examined. Q. Did they not tell you where they came from? A. Yes-from Wilsden—they said they had been haymaking for Mr. Hays, and their names they gave correctly-another was in company with them—I took Fisher by the shoulder, and Carter came to the station, but the third one went away—after I put the prisoners into the station I went to look for the other, but he had run away—the man was not present when Carter said it was his own-Carter did not say he was carrying the bundle to help the man.

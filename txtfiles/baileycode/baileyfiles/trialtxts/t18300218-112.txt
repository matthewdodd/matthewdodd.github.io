            ; which said letter is to the effect following: - (i.e.)
SIR, - I am extremely sorry to be under the disagreeable necessity of waiting on you, but under the circumstance I cannot help it; the serjeant that was with me at Drury-lane Theatre, on Wednesday night, has threatened to report me to the officer of my detachment, for taking such a compensation from you, for the insult I received; and does further declare, that I must return you your money, and lodge a complaint against you directly; so what to do I know not; I am sorry from the heart, that a man like you (of seeming respectability) should be guilty of the like. I have said all that I could to him, but am afraid to no purpose. I have taken this plan to mention it to prevent any person from hearing the conversation; a few moments conversation with you would be advisable, away from the house. - I am Sir, your most obedient.
WM. SHUTTER, Corporal.
To Mr. Haurum.
against the Staute, &c.
2nd COUNT, like the first, only calling it a threatening letter, &c.
3rd COUNT, like the second, only stating that he did deliver a certain letter demanding, with menaces and without any reasonable or probable cause, certain money, with intent, &c.
MORGAN ORAM. On the 6th of January I went to the 2s. gallery at Drury-lane theatre with two little boys - there was a very great crowd at the door: the prisoner was there - he called out to another soldier, "Houston, this person has assaulted me;" I said, "It is false if you say so; any more than being pushed against you, which you know was the effect of accident, the crowd being so great"- I was then holding the youngest boy with my two hands to prevent his being hurt in the crowd; the other boy was further on - the other soldier turned round and said,"Never mind now, stop till bye and bye:" after a little while, he turned round again, winked at the prisoner, and said "Keep your eye upon him;" this was before the doors opened, and just as the doors opened he said, "Take off his excommunication;" the doors opened, there was a great rush, and the little boy cried out - I said to the prisoner, "Do take care, and don't hurt him;" he immediately took him up in his arms, and said he would take him into the theatre - I took some money out of my pocket to give the prisoner to pay for the boy's admission and in my confusion I gave him the 6s. 6d., which was all I had in my pocket - when I got to the pay-place I told the eldest boy he must wait there while I went back for some more money, as I had given it all to the soldier, or had dropped it - the prisoner took the little boy into the theatre, and I went back for more money; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I went back, and took the elder boy into the theatre - I looked for the prisoner, on account of his having the child, and saw him about half way down the gallery, sitting by the side of the little boy - the gallery was so full I could not get near him at all, but I called to him, and told him to take care of the boy till the play was over; which he did, and when it was over, he brought him to me - I gave the prisonersomething, but I am not certain what it was, "I was so agitated from the threats he had made use of in the first place - he did not make use of any then; I took the two boys home to the City - nothing else passed between the prisoner and I on that occasion; I have no idea what I gave him - it was a little change; on the Friday following the prisoner brought me a letter to No. 6, Tavistock-street, where I live - he had not known before where I lived; the little boy will state how he came to find me out - when the prisoner brought the letter he said, "Take it, and read it, and come away from the house; I want to speak to you"- I read it, and the officer has it; this is the letter - I went up Charles-street with him, and he said the serjeant obliged him to come to me for some more money, as the paltry sum I had given was not enough - I said it was a shameful and a scandalous thing to come to me for money when he knew he had no charge against me, but being pushed against him - he said he knew that, but he was obliged to come, as his serjeant would not be satisfied without my sending him a couple of sovereigns - I said it was a very hard case indeed, as I had not so much money by me - I had not above a sovereign and 1s. 6d. - he said he could not help it, if I did not send more he should he obliged to come again; and under the threats be made use of, I took out the sovereign and three sixpences, and gave him - I said that was all I had; he said he would try if that would satisfy the serjeant, and walked away with the money. On the Friday following a little boy brought two letters, one inclosed in the other, nearly to the same purport as the other was - I went out, and found the prisoner in Charles-street waiting for me; he said he was sorry, from his heart, to have to come to me, but his serjeant obliged him to come to get some more money - I said it was a very great shame that he should come in that way for money, when he had acknowledged, the last time he saw me, that he had no charge against me; he said he knew that, but his serjeant obliged him to come, or else he would report him, and he should get flogged - I said he had extorted money from me, and he wanted to extort more - he said he should be sory to do that, but he had had a long walk, he had just come off duty, and he hoped I would give him something - I offered him 2s. 6d. which had been marked; as I had in the mean time told my landlord, who had told a gentleman of it, and this plan had been arranged - the prisoner refused to take the 2s. 6d.; Mr. Tate came up, and took him into custody - he was very much confused, and begged to be let go; Mr. Tate gave him to an officer.
Prisoner. Q. What was the cause of our first interview? A. It was quite accidental - I was pushed against you by the crowd, as any other person might; and that would not have happened if you had not turned almost facing me.
Q. What money did you give me? A. Six shillings and sixpence, to pay for the boy, because you took him in your arms - I did not know I gave you the whole 6s. 6d.; I told you to pay for him, nothing else; I certainly said I would see you after the performance, to take the boy home, or words to that effect - when you brought the boy I gave you something, I do not know what.
Q. Did you not, on your examination, deny giving me any thing but the 6s. 6d. at the theatre, and the 1l. 1s. 6d. in the street? A. I could not recollect every circumstance.
COURT. Q. Did you say you had not given him any other money? A. I believe I said I could not recollect the circumstance.
Prisoner. When the play was over he gave me 10s. in a paper. Witness. I cannot say what it was - I do not recollect putting it in paper; I believe it was in paper.
COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you would see him when the play was over? A. To take the little boy of him - I do not know what I gave him, it might be a few shillings - I cannot swear whether it was less or more than 10s.
Prisoner. When he gave me the 6s. 6d. he said, "Take this, I will give you more after the performance is over, but do not expose me. Witness. I did not say such a word; I said I would see him when it was over, when he was at the pay door.
COURT. Q. Did you say you would bring more money? A. No, I do not know what I got when I went home - but whatever I gave him was in consequence of the threats he made use of.
Prisoner. On the examination I asked him what money he gave me when the performance was over, and he said none. Witness. I believe I said I could not recollect.
COURT. Q. Did you deny giving him money at the end of the play? A. I believe I said I could not recollect; the push was quite accidental, and not in any indecent manner.

            . My father is a deputy seacoal meter. I went with the witness to Drury-lane theatre on the night of the 6th of January; I saw the prisoner in the street, standing near the door - I heard him say Mr. Oram had assaulted him; Mr. Oram said it was false, it was the crowd pushed him - the prisoner said he had assaulted his person, to the best of my recollection - Mr. Oram was rather behind him; the prisoner said to another soldier, "Come out;" the other said, "Never mind;" the prisoner then said, "Houston keep your eye upon him" - we went into the theatre when the door was opened, which was in about half an hour; I went up stairs rather before Mr. Oram - when he came up, he said he was afraid he had lost his money; I said, "Have you had your pocket picked?" he said he must go back, and get some money; I waited for him - the other little boy is my brother; Mr. Oram came back in about ten minutes, and paid for me and himself - the prisoner took my brother in; I did not take notice how he got money to pay for him - after the play was over the prisoner brought my brother to Mr. Oram, who had waited for them, and Mr. Oram told me to go down and wait for him - he came down with my brother, and joined me; I know of nothing else.
Prisoner. Q. How long have you known him? A. About twelve months - he took me to the play because my father had not time to go.
Q. Have you ever been alone with him? A. Yes, out walking - he never took any liberties with me.
COURT. Q. Attend to that, did he ever take any liberties with you? A. No - I never had an idea that he was a person likely to commit any indecency.

            . I was at the theatre on the 6th ofJanuary; there was a squeeze in the crowd before we got in - I saw the prisoner, and heard him say Mr. Oram had assulted him; I understood he had pushed against him- Mr. Oram said it was a story, he had been pushed against him - the prisoner said to the other soldier, "This fellow has assaulted me," and the prisoner said he would fetch some one to take Mr. Oram away - the prisoner took me to the third or fourth seat in the gallery; I did not see how he got any money - I did not see Mr. Oram give him any - the prisoner paid for me; I did not ask how he came to have the money for me - Mr. Oram said to him, "Good night," when it was over; I did not see him give him any money.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not see him shake hands with me? A. Yes.
Prisoner. That was the time the 10s. was put into my hand.

            . On the 15th of January, about half-past three o'clock, Mr. Farrow, of Tavistock-street, who is Mr. Oram's landlord, told me of this circumstance - I stood with him some time, and a boy came into the shop; Mr. Farrow said, "Here is a note on the business I spokeabout"- I said I knew what soldiers were, and I advised Mr. Oram to go and tender the prisoner some marked money, and I should follow, to hear what he said - I followed him, and saw the prisoner join him near the end of Bow-street, they walked up Bow-street, and turned down a passage into Long-acre - I was as close behind them as I could be, without treading on their heels, and could hear their conversation from time to time - I heard Mr. Oram say it was a most false accusation; there was no ground for it, and it was very unjust that he should take the steps he did - the prisoner said he was sorry from his heart or soul, but he was obliged to do it - he did not believe him guilty of the charge, but was compelled to it by the serjeant, (I think;) I followed them into Longacre, and being fearful they might turn down a court, I took the prisoner, as I knew Oram was a timid man - I had seen Oram before this - I should observe, I had seen Oram offer him 2s. 6d., and the prisoner said it would not he worth his while to take so small a sum, as he had come a considerable distance - I took the prisoner, and brought him to Tavistock-street - I was very much excited at the time - a Police-man was sent for, and took him.
Prisoner. Q. How long have you known Oram? A. I should think eighteen months, or nearly, from seeing him at Mr. Farrow's.
Prisoner. This gentleman, when on his oath at his examination, said he had known him eight or nine years.
JOSEPH ROBINSON. I am a Police-man - I took the prisoner at Mr. Farrow's from Oram; he said that he had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the 2s. gallery.
COURT. Q. What did Oram say? A. He said he had come to the house under a pretence of accusing him of taking improper liberties with his person, to get money, and he desired me to take him to the watch-house - the prisoner said, on our way to the watch-house, that the prosecutor had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the theatre, and he confessed he had received some money - I believe he said 6s. at the entrance of the door, then 10s., and then a sovereign, and three sixpences.
Prisoner. Q. Where you present at the examination? A. Yes - Mr. Oram certainly did deny that he gave you the 10s.

            . I am an inspector of the Police, and was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; this letter was delivered to me by Oram -I went up the same night to the riding establishment in St. John's-wood, where I understood the serjeant was, and I took him before the Magistrate the following morning, but it was Corporal 
               Houston
            ; he corroborated the statement of the prisoner, as to what he said took place at the entrance of the theatre - I heard the prisoner say Oram gave him 6s. 6d. before he went in, and when he came out 10s., wrapped in paper; but Oram denied giving him the 10s.
Prisoner's Defence. On the night in question, I was at the theatre door, and was insulted by Oram; he gave me this money not to expose him; there was 6s. 6d., which was just sufficient for him and the two boys; he told me when the performance was over he would see me again; I brought the boy out, and he handed me the paper with 10s. in it; he put out his hand, and shook hands with me, and in a low tone of voice he said, "Here is 10s., don't expose me;" I saw no more of him till the day he gave me the 1l. 1s. 6d.; on his examination he denied giving me the 10s., and therefore must be allowed to be a perjured man, which I hope your Lordship will allow me to have the benefit of.
ALEXANDER HOUSTON. I am a corporal in the Light Dragoons, and was at the theatre - I heard the prisoner say Oram had insulted him, and he had his hand on Oram's shoulder; I was about a yard in advance of them; the prisoner said, "Come out;" I could not get out, but I saw Oram tremble like an aspin-leaf - I said, "Keep your eyes on him;" in a few minutes the doors were opened - I saved a place for the prisoner - I said, "Where is Oram?" he said, "He is safe enough, he gave me this boy as a pledge, and he gave me 6s. to pay for the boy and me, and 2s. 6d. to drink;" after it was over, he said, "He has given me a cartridge;" we went to a public-house, and opened it, and found 10s. in it - in going down the street he said, "I was obliged to borrow money for my admission, and I have no more money on my person than this;" I never desired him to go to Mr. Oram, and get more money of him, nor ever had a moment's conversation on the subject, till I was brought a prisoner to Bow-street - I did not know Oram's name till I heard it before the Magistrate - I did not say, "Take off his excommunication."

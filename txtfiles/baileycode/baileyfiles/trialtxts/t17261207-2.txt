             thus depos'd. I had been taking a Glass of Wine, and when I came home I saw two or three Men upon my Lighters, two of them run away, the Prisoner was in the Boat with the Coals, I believe there might be about 33 Bushels in the Boat, I mist 19 Bushels out of my Lighter, the other I suppose he might take out of another Lighter which lay just by mine, for his Boat was between the two Lighters; When I seiz'd him I ask'd him what he did there, he gave a very random Account, first, that he bought the Coals below Bridge, and afterwards came over the Water with them.

             thus depos'd. I and my Brother called on the Prisoner to go and get some Coals, it having been the Prisoner's Practice many Years to buy Coals at an under Rate of Lightermens Servants. We came to Paul's Wharf


, and out of two Lighters took near a Chaldron of Coals before the Prosecutor interrupted us. The Prisoner in his Defence said, The two other Men made him fuddled, and forc'd him to go with them. The Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

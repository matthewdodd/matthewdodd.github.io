            . I have part of a house in Low Layton


. The prisoner lay three nights with me. I mist her and the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) on the 5th of this instant. I found them again when the prisoner was taken. The other witness can give a better account.

            . On the 5th of November I was told the prosecutrix had been robbed by the prisoner, who lay with her. I set off after her; and the next day I was informed she was at a chandler's shop, up one pair of stairs, at the corner of Compton-street, Hog-Lane. I went with the constable there, and found her and the things. She delivered them to me. We took her to Clerkenwell-Bridewell. She confessed she took them from the prosecutrix. (Produced and deposed to.)

The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

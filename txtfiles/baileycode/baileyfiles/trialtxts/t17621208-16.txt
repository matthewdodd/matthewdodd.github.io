            . I live near the Hermitage bridge


. On the 4th of Nov. at night, my house was broke open, the bar of the cellar window was taken away, when they got in there they opened the cellar door, and came up into the house, all were fast over night. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I advertised them, and on Saturday at noon Mr. Bopard came to me, he said, he believed he had seen my watch. I described mine, then he said he had it, that he bought it for 34 s. he said his apprentice could swear to the identity of the man he bought it of. Then I desired him to go down to the rendezvous with his apprentice, to see if it was not one of the seamen; (we had found a bludgoon by my counter the morning after the robbery, which I thought I had seen before in a sailor's hand) but during the time we were there, the woman at the bar carried some silk handkerchiefs to pledge at Mr. Bopard's, and she was secured, she being with the man when the watch was sold; then we went with her before justice Willoughby, there she said the man at the bar told her he bought the watch. She was put into the Tower goal, and in the morning she was carried before justice Pell; the man was taken and brought there also; they denied knowing each other. He owned he sold the watch, and said he bought it of one

            . On the 5th of Nov. about 9 o'clock, I was upstairs. My apprentice

                  Cisheir 
               



             came up to me, and asked me what I would lend upon this watch? I looked at it, and said, a guinea, and no more. I asked, who brought it? he said, a woman and a sailer boy; that the woman had the watch. He went down, and presently came up again, and said, they would sell it. My apprentice bought it for 34 s. After this, upon reading the advertisement, I found out the prosecutor. The man said in my hearing, he bought this watch in the Minories, and at another time he said, he bought it of a shipmate, name Wilson.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Bopard. The two prisoners came together to our shop with this watch. The man said, he bought it of a man in the Minories for 4 l. and before the Justice he said, he bought it of a young man, a sailor. I bought it of him, as he said it was his own.
Watson's Defence.
I am a young lad lately come from sea. I hope your Lordship will take it into consideration. I can't explain myself as I could wish. I come home from the West-Indies; I brought a letter from this woman's husband; I found her out, and told her, he was well; she asked me to drink; I got in liquor; from that I became acquainted with her. I received 15 guineas for my voyage; there was a young man wanted to sell this watch; I said, how much do you ask for it, Cock? he said 2 guineas; she persuaded me to buy it; I gave him 2 guineas for it. After that I wanting money, went with her to Mr. Bopard's, and sold it.

            's Defence.
My mistress in Swan-alley desired me to go along with this young man, when he went to pawn the watch.

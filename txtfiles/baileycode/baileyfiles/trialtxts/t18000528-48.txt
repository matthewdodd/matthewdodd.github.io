- WHITE sworn. - I am a patrol of the parish of St. Sepulchre: On Saturday, the 3d of this month, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in a croud in Fleet-market


, he followed a gentleman and took a handkerchief out of his pocket; I immediately seized him, took him out of the croud, and took the handkerchief out of his right-hand,(produces it); the gentleman had walked on; I left the prisoner in care of my partner while I went after the gentleman, but could not find him; we brought the prisoner to the watch-house; upon searching him, I found two more handkerchiefs; this is the handkerchief that I saw him take from the gentleman.
Prisoner's defence. I had no handkerchief in my hand; what he has sworn is as false as it is true that there is a God in heaven; one handkerchief was full of holes, and the other I had a clean shirt wrapped up in it.

The Prosecutor is a tallow-chandler
, he sent Dennis his servant
, with a parcel of candles to Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Fairfax 
               



            . They were weighed after delivered, and three pounds missing. The Prisoner was taken up, and owned he had taken the three pounds out of that parcel, and sold them to Wyate the other Prisoner; who, he said, had encouraged him to steal candles, and he had bought for three pence a pound of him. This he confessed before the justice, and his confession was taken in writing, and signed by him, and read in Court.

185. (M.) Dennis was a second time indicted, for 


               stealing three pounds weight of candles
            , the property of 
               
                  Allen 
                  Parsons

                     Mary 
                     Barker 
                  



                
             for 


               receiving them, well knowing them to have been stolen

It appeared by the same confession, taken before the justice, the Prisoner had sold the three pounds of candles to the Prisoner Barker, but that she bought them at the common price that people buy them to sell again.

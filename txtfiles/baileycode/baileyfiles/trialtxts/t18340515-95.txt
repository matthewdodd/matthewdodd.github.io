             (police-constable D 66). In consequence of information, I went on the 2nd of May, about two o'clock in the morning, to the prisoners' house, No. 21, Charles-street, Lisson-grove - I found the prisoners in a back room on the ground floor with a man named Brewer - I asked if they knew any thing of some wet linen - they said they did not - I searched 
               
                  James 
                  Foley
               



            , and foundin his great coat pocket this key, and in his waistcoat pocket a sixpence and two half-pence - I found nothing on Henry Foley nor on Brewer - I then searched the room, and found in a box this jar, two shirts, two shifts, and an oil can - I then took them to the station, and next day the prisoners were committed - I went with this key to the prosecutor's house, No. 12, Upper Seymour-street, Portman-square - I tried it to the gate in the presence of Mr. Henwood, and it unlocked it - I asked Henry Foley whose box it was - he said his - I then asked how the linen came in it - he said he knew nothing about it - I found a cotton handkerchief on the back of a chair, which James Foley said was his, and he had been carrying fish in it, but it did not smell of fish.

            . I am the wife of Thomas Henwood; he is a porter
. I had this wet linen in the area of my house, which is about a mile from the prisoner's house - these things were taken in the night, I believe - I hung them up on the 1st of May, and next morning I missed them - I know nothing of the prisoners - these are my property.
James Foley's Defence. I took the things in from Daniel Brewer, who is a returned transport. I put them into the box - Brewer said he would take them away in the morning - he went and told the officer they were there.

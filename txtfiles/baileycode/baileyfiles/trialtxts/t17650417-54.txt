            . On Good Friday, between 2 and 4 o'clock, I lost a kit of salmon from the King's Head at Billingsgate


, and paid 18 s. for it. My sister-in-law bought it, and trusted me to carry it to her house at Peckham: I never met with it again. I had left it in the house, and when I came for it, it was gone.
Jos. Buckmaster. That day we had about 300 kitts of salmon came in. I met the prisoner with a kit of salmon under his arm, about half an hour after 3 o'clock that day, at the King's Head door as I was going in. I said, How odd that man carries his kit of salmon! Soon after that Russel came in and enquired for his kit, and it was missing. The next time I saw the prisoner, I asked him how he came by that kit? he said, he never had any, or sold any salmon in his life. When we came before the sitting Aldermen, there he owned he took the kit of salmon, being drunk, and was willing to make restitution. He said he sold it at Greenwich.
Russel. I heard him confess the same.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was called in at the King's Head to carry a kit of salmon down to the Old Swan, for a woman. I carried them, and she gave me 3 d. for it: she took them away in a boat.

            . Between seven and eight, in the morning, on the 27th of September, I lost my watch in Southampton-street, Bloomsbury, it was taken from the head of my bed, I got up, and went about my business, and had left it hanging. I am building a house, and I was in that house till I can dispose of it. The prisoner came under pretence of taking that house for a lady, he had been there about three weeks before. After he was gone, I missed my watch. I suspected him, but did not know where to find him. After that, he was taken up and committed to New-prison, for another offence. Then I went to justice Fielding, and got an order to search him. I went to the prison to him, he was searched in my presence, and my watch found upon him. [ Produced in Court, and deposed to.]
Thomas Street. I keep the tap in the New-prison. The prisoner was committed for stealing a hat, in an apothecary's shop, the prosecutor came to have him searched. I saw him with it in his hand when searching. I had a great deal to do, to wrench it out of his hand; it has been in my custody ever since, this is it here produced.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had cured the man of the foul disease, he having no money, he gave me this watch, in part of payment, saying, I came teising him from time to time.

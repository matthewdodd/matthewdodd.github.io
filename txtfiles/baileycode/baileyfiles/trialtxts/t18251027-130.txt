            . I am the wife of Samuel Poole, grocer
 and cheesemonger
, Upper Russell-street, Bryanstone-square


. On the 18th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in the little parlour, facing the shop door, and heard the halfpence rattle; I went into the shop, where I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, inside the counter, with the till, which he had got out - I caught him and asked what he was doing; he said Nothing, and struggled to get off; I held him, and cried out - one of my neighbours came in and took him. I had 13 s. 6 d. in silver, and 5 1/4 d. in copper in my till.

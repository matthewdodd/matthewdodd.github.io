            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I met the prisoner between six and seven o'clock on the evening of the 2d of February, in Whitechapel, with a basket of tools on his shoulder - I asked what he had got; he said, some tools, and was going to get money on them - it was near a pawnbroker's shop. I took the basket, and it contained carpenters' tools. I asked whose property it was - he said his own.

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Vann - we met the prisoner with this basket; he said the tools belonged to himself, and he had worked with them two years.
JOHN CHRISTMAS. I am a carpenter
. I lost my tools on the 1st or 2d of February, from an unfinished house in Durham-street, Hackney-road


; I had left the door nailed up about a quarter past nine o'clock on the evening of the 1st of February - they were gone next morning. The prisoner was a watchman on the premises.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the tools - when I left the premises in the morning I left all safe; I did not go home till the afternoon, and met a man, who asked me if I would earn 1 s. and pawn a basket of tools.

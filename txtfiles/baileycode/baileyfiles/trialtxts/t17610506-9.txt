            . On April the 10th, near nine in the evening, I happened to go into my shop, and saw the prisoner taking some shoes off a shelf, she went out of the shop, I went and took hold of her, and she dropp'd the shoes about my feet, five pair and an odd shoe.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Gale. No, she was quite a stranger, I took the prisoner to the watch-house.
Q. Was you with her before the justice?
Gale. I was; there in my hearing she own'd she took the shoes.

            . I pick'd up eleven shoes a little way from the door, after the prisoner had dropp'd them.
Q. Did you see them fall?
S. Watkins. I did, from out of her apron.

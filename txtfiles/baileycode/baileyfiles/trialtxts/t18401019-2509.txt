ELIOENAI SHARP
 was indicted

for forging, on the 
19th of October, a certain acquittance and receipt for 7l. 4s. 6d., with intent to defraud 



Numa Sisley.






NUMA SISLEY
. I am a shawl dealer, and live in Watling-street; James Sharp, the prisoner's father, is a shawl maker. On Monday morning last, the prisoner came to my counting-house and said he called from his father for the money for a bill of 7l. 4s. 6d., which he presented—I told him to look in the next morning, and I would look over the account—he said his father had some bills to pay that morning, and he would be obliged to me for the money—I did not know the prisoner before, but after he told me his father wanted the money I drew a cheque for the amount and gave it him—I asked him for a receipt—he wrote this receipt, and signed it "James Sharp."

Prisoner. Q. Did you owe the money, or did your brother? A. My brother did.





JAMES SHARP
. I am a shawl maker. The prisoner is my eldest son—he lived with me till last Saturday evening, when he absented himself—I had employed him in my business—he made out two bills for what Mr. Sisley owed me—one he took away, and one he left—I did not give him authority to go to Mr. Sisley, and receive the money on my account—I knew nothing of it—the prisoner's name is Elioenai, not James—this receipt (looking at it) is not my writing, nor written by my consent or knowledge.






THOMAS COVELL HANSON
 (City police-constable, No. 461.) I was on duty in Watling-street, and took the prisoner—I saw his mouth moving, and found the remains of the cheque in his mouth.

Prisoner. I do not see that receiving that bill would defraud the prosecutor at all; if it would defraud any body it was my father.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—

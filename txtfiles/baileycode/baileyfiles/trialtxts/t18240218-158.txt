JOHN M'DONALD. I live in Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street


. On the 24th January, I put my pistol on a shelf by the side of my bed, and missed it on the 28th. The prisoner lodged in the house. I charged him with taking it; he said he had sold it in Aylesbury-street, for 1 s. I told him I would go there with him, and while I went for my hat he ran off.

            . The prisoner lodged at my house, in the same room as the prosecutor - he went by the name of Bull. He acknowledged selling the pistol in my presence.

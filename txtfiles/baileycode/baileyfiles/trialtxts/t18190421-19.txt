JAMES ADLARD. I am a tailor
, and live at Pimlico. On the 15th of March, about eleven o'clock at night, I turned out of Pall-Mall


, to go into the Park


, in my way home. Three men came along, who appeared in a bustle; I made way for them - they just brushed me. At that time the prisoner caught hold of my right arm, and asked me to go with her? I said,
"No - I have no money, it is money you want, and not me;" she said I had got a trifle. By this time we had got through the narrow entrance, by the chapel, she let go my arm, as I thought to leave me, and then snatched my watch, and ran off to the men, as hard as she could; I followed her, she was stopped by a guard. I saw the men push her,; my watch was not found, but I am certain she snatched it. I never lost sight of her.
Prisoner's Defence. He wanted me to go with him, I refused, and he called Stop thief!

            . Aged 21.

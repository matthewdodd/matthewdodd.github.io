MICHAEL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of March, 1 candlestick, value 1l., the goods of 



John William Church; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN WILLIAM CHURCH
. I am a retailer of beer, and live in Penton-street, Newington. On Saturday afternoon, the 12th of March, about three o'clock, the prisoner was in my house—I saw him go into the kitchen, deliberately take a candlestick off the shelf, and conceal it under his jacket—I immediately collared him—the policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—this is my candlestick.

Prisoner. I picked it up in the skittle-ground, where it was lying—I not capable of going about. Witness, I have no skittle-ground.


Prisoner. I do not know what he may call it, I have been in it a great many times.





JOHN KINO
 (police-constable P 176.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 42.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Paul Garry. I lost a Fiddle, and a pair of Breeches out of my House, the Horse shoe and Magpye in Drury-Lane


 . The Prisoner had lodged with me about 3 Weeks, and suspecting him, I had him taken up, and he confessed them. He took the Violin out of the Cupboard, in the Bar, and had sold it in Exeter-Change for 3 s. and the Breeches to one Vigers for 1 s . and 6 d.
Vigers . I buy and sell second-hand Cloaths; the Prisoner brought these Breeches to my Shop about a Fortnight before they were found upon me, I bought them , and gave him 1 s. and 6 d. which is the Worth of them; I believe him to be the Man, but there is a great Alteration in him now; for he had a Livery-Frock on, with red Puffs, when he was at my Shop. 


               Guilty 10 d.

SAMUEL EYLAND. I am a shoemaker

. I heard a cry of Stop thief! about three o'clock, on the 29th of September - I ran out, and saw my servant picking up these articles, which are mine; I went with her to the bottom of the street, and took the prisoner, whom she pointed out.

            . I am Mr. Eyland's servant. I was coming out of the room, and saw the prisoner coming down-stairs with a bundle - she was a stranger; I followed, calling Stop thief! - she dropped it about ten yards off; I took it up - it contained these articles, which are master's; I am certain of her person.

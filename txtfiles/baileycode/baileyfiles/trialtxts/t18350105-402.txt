JOHN ALLEN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of October, 4 yards of woollen cloth, value 3l. 12s.; and three-quarters of a yard of kerseymere, value 5s.; the goods of 



Joseph Tilley, his master.






JOSEPH TILLEY
. I am a tailor, and live in Porter-street, Newport-market. The prisoner had been my apprentice for twelve months—on the 1st of October, I missed four yards of cloth and three-quarters of a yard of kerseymere—the prisoner absconded—this is the property.





JOHN JAMES BARTLETT
. I live at Mr. Wood's, a pawnbroker, at the corner of Compton-street. This piece of cloth was redeemed by the prosecutor—it was pawned on the 1st of October, for 10s., by a boy, in the name of John Dove, for his mother, No. 17, Andrew-street—I do not recollect the person.





EDWARD NORTH
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce four yards of cloth, which I took in on the 2nd of October, of a youth, who I believe was the prisoner.





JAMES DENNIS
 (police-constable F 141.) The prisoner was given into my charge.


Prisoner. My master went out and staid out all night—he took a sovereign, and accused me of stealing it.

COURT
to
JOSHUA TILLEY. Q. Did you stay out all night? A. No; I was out a few hours—I lost a sovereign, but I did not suspect him, nor make any charge against him—he has been guilty of embezzlement.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

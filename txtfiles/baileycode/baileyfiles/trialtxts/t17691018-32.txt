            . We live at No. 36, in the Little Old-Bailey


. On the 17th of last month the prisoner came to my house. I left him in the house alone, while I went to Snow-Hill on an errand. I was absent not a quarter of an hour. When I returned, he met me on the top of the stairs, and said he must go, and away he went. I went to iron three shirts in the morning, and found them gone, and two pair of cotton stockings. The next morning he was taken up, and confessed two of the shirts and one pair of stockings were at his mother's. When I came there, there was only one shirt and one pair of stockings. He had one shirt on when taken. (Two shirts and one pair of stockings produced in court, and deposed to.) He served four years of his time with my husband.
Ann Green. The prisoner gave me one shirt and one pair of stockings out of his pocket in Wood-street Compter.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went there to supper. When she was gone out, being much in liquor, I took a cloth. I did not know what was in it. I went to carry them again on the Monday morning, and they were not up. Then I thought to carry them in the evening, and before that they took me up.

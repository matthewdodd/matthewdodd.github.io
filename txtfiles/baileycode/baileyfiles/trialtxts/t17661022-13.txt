            . I live in Monmouth-street; we are all separate traders there; I lost three thickset coats, two pair of leather breeches, a thickset waistcoat, a pair of thickset breeches, and two linen waistcoats; they were missing at separate times, and I found them again at the pawnbrokers; the prisoner confest he took them.
Q. How came you to suspect him?
J. Dawson. 
               
                  John 
                  Clements 
               



             brought a thickset coat into my shop, to be sold on the 11th or 12th of September; I knew it to be mine, and I stopt it, which led me to the knowledge of the prisoner; he was taken before a magistrate, and there confessed he took the things mentioned at different times, and went round with us to the pawnbrokers, where we found them (two linen waistcoats, a pair of in breeches, and a thickset coat, produced and deposed to;) these we found in Berwick-street Soho, at Mr Cordey's; the prisoner made use of several names; here is my own hand-writing on the inside the leather breeches.


                  John 
                  Clements 
               



            . I took some things out of pawn for the prisoner, at Mr. Price's near Clare-market, at the prisoner's desire, to go and sell them; they came to 1 l. 7 s. and 8 d. halfpenny; I went to Mr. Dawson to sell them, and he stopp'd me; then I told him who I had them of.
Mr. Cardey. These things here produced were pawned to me by the prisoner at the bar; he came by the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



            , and said they were his own property, and gave me a direction where he lived; I looked upon him to be a gentleman, he came genteely dressed, every time in different sorts of cloaths; after that Mr. Dawson and he came together for them.
Mr. Nash (produced a thickset coat and a pair of breeches) These I took in of the prisoner at the bar, in the name of Miller.
J. Dawson. These are my property.
Prisoner. I have no question to ask but of 
               
                  John 
                  Dawson 
               



            ; I told him I had pawned the things at several times, and he told me he would never indict me.
J. Dawson. I did not promise him that; I told him I would not indict him capitally; we found of his pawning goods to the value of 60 l.
The Jury were satisfied without any farther evidence as to the other prosecutors.

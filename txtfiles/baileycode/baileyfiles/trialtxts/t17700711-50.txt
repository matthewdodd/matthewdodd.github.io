Mr. Vazey gave the same evidence as on that trial.
Thomas Hall deposed, That he heard the prisoner say, that he had the goods of Davis; that he used to leave his key with his sister when he went to work, in case Davis bought any goods; that he repeated the same before the justice; and that Davis told him they were smuggled.
The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.

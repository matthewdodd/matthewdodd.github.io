JOHN HEALEY
. On the 16th of November, I was in Holborn, about eight o'clock in the evening—I lost my handkerchief, but did not feel it taken—two gentlemen called to me, and I saw it on the pavement—this is it.





EDWARD LEWIS
. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner with another person—the prisoner was in the act of extracting this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—my brother seized him when he had got it quite out, and the other person ran away.





GEORGE LEWIS
. I was with my brother—what he has stated is correct—I seized the prisoner with my left hand, and put my hand round the neck of the other, but he escaped.

Prisoner's Defence. There were two lads behind this gentleman, who threw the handkerchief at my feet—I did not have it in my hand.

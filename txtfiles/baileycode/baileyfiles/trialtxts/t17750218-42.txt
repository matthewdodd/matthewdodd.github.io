            . Yesterday was three weeks, about eleven in the forenoon, I had some firkins of butter in my cart, going along by Temple-Bar


, I saw the prisoner go behind the cart and take out a firkin of butter, he put it on his shoulder and went off, I followed him and colared him with it on his shoulder, he said it was his, I am sure it is one of the firkins that was in my cart, I saw him take it out, there was 56 lb. of it, (the firkin produced in court and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was crossing the way the tub fell out of the cart, I took it up and was going to put it in again, when he stoped me.
The Prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.

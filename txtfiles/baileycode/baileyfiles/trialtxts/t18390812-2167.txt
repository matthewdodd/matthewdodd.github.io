THOMAS BRUCKETT
. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Woodward, ironmonger, of Frith-street, Soho. About three o'clock, on the 30th of July, the prisoners came for 1d. worth of screws—having suspicion I got under the counter, looked through a hole in a panel of the counter, and saw them trying to get a parcel off the counter—I saw Hogan get it off the

counter and give it to Ames, who put it into a slit in his trowsers—they went out—I went after them, stopped them, and found six brass castors under Ames's apron—they are my master's.

Hogan's Defence. I did not take them.

Ames's Defence. Hogan took them and gave them to me—my father and mother have been dead eleven years.

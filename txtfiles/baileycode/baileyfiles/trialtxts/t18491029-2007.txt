WILLIAM JAMESON



, feloniously forging and uttering an order for payment of 40l. 5s.; with intent to defraud 



Sir Peter Laurie, Knt., and others.


MESSRS. RYLAND
and
PLATT
conducted the Prosecution.






BRYAN REYNOLDS
. I am cashier of the Argyle-street branch of the Union Bank of London; the chief office is in Princes-street. On 17th Oct. the

prisoner came and presented this check—("Pay Messrs. Dakin 49l. 4s., and debit the same to my account. WILLIAM H. ACRETT.") Mr. Acrett was a customer—I had misgivings about the check, and showed it to the manager—we both spoke to the prisoner. Mr. Clark asked where he got it—he said" From Dakin's, St. Paul's Churchyard"—he was given into custody.





WILLIAM GODFREY
 (policeman, C 147). I took the prisoner—he said be told the gentleman he had the check from Dakin's, but that was false—I asked where he had it; he said, "From a man in the neighbourhood of Golden-square"—I asked who it was; he said he did not know, no more than he had seen him occasionally before, but did not know his name, or where he lived—I asked him if he wrote it—he said no, but he believed it to be a forgery when he presented it.





WILLIAM HENRY ACRETT
. I am a surgeon, of Torrington-square—I keep an account at the Argyle-street branch of the Union Bank of London—this check is not drawn or signed by me or by anybody by my authority—I have seen the prisoner when he was assistant to a chemist in my neighbourhood.





ALEXANDER MAITLAND
. I am a chemist, of Torrington-place. The prisoner was my assistant up to 28th March—I know his writing as well as I know his person—the whole of this check is his—I have hundreds of his entries in my prescription-book.

Prisoner. I did not say I believed it to be a forgery, but that I was fearful it was; I had my doubts about it; it is not my writing.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I live in Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road, and am a hackney-coach driver
; the prisoner was in the habit of coming to me every night. On the 11th of August, he came and said he was very hungry. I told him to ride behind my coach till I could get some money, and then I would give him something to eat. I got an eighteen-penny fare, and bought him some meat. While he was at the public-house, he was looking at my coat, and said it was a good one - I said it was, and if I lost it I should be ruined. He said,
"Give it to me, and I will put it on the box." I gave it to him, and he set off with it. I did not see him again until the 11th of September, when I found him at Lambeth workhouse. We were brought up together.
Prisoner's Defence. I put it on the box.

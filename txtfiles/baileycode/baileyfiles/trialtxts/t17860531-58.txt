             sworn.
Me and another patrol stopped the prisoner with half a sieve, covered with a cloth; he said it was garden-stuff; he pitched it, and I found it to be lead; he sprung from me, and ran down the Minories; I have compared the lead to a house of Mr. Foreman's, and it fits the place; the nail holes correspond; one of these keys opens the street door; we found these keys and these wall-hooks in his coat-pocket.

             sworn.
I saw the lead compared, and it corresponded.
Prisoner. A man asked me to carry it; he told me it was garden stuff, and he put the key and things in my coat pocket.
Jury. How came you by these wall-hooks? - The man that lifted the basket upon my head dropped them in my right-hand-pocket.

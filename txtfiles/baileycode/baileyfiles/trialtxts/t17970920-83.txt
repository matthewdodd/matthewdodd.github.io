                  , privately in his shop
            .
JOSEPH SHEPHERD sworn. - I live in Aldgate High-street


; I am a linen-draper
; the prisoner came into my shop in company with another person; I was serving a customer at the time they came in; after they had been in the shop some time, I went to them; my young man was serving the prisoner and her companion; I endeavoured to serve them with some printed cottons for some time; the prisoner at the bar appeared to be a little in liquor; I shewed her several articles, she requested several times to know the lowest price, and I told her that was the lowest price, and if she did not approve of it, to go somewhere else; I found there was no serving of her, and so I left her; my wife came to me, and told me that there was a piece of cotton sell down upon the ground, and she had drawn it up; in consequence of that, I looked at the remnant of print, and then went over to other side of the counter where the prisoner was, suspecting she might have something aside, as she had a long cloak upon her; I turned aside her cloak, and another remnant of print dropped from underneath; and there was another gown piece some where about her, but I do not know where it was attached to, that my wife laid hold of; after the prisoner saw that she was detected, she seemed very much alarmed, and was very refractory; I offered to search her, and she sat down on the ground, and said, she was with child; I desired a neighbour to stay with her till I got a constable; after she was detected, the person that came in with her, I saw on the other side of the way in a different habit, she had taken off her cloak and bonnet, or something; she was then taken to the Magistrate.
Mrs. SHEPHERD sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: On the 12th of September, the prisoner came into our shop; as she was looking at some printed cottons, I saw a piece drop from behind her upon the ground; I took it up, and calledMr. Shepherd; I asked him if he had sold it, her, he said, he had not; he came on the side on which the prisoner was standing, and threw her cloak aside; I then observed another remnant of print fall from her waist, which I took from the ground, likewise a piece that she had tied round her waist; I took out a gown piece which she had tucked in her handkerchief, and gave it to Mr. Shepherd; the constable has got the property.

             sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for to take the prisoner; I had the things given me in charge; the ward-beadle was there before me. (The property was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).
Court. Q. What is the value of these things? - A. About two and twenty shillings.
Prisoner's defence I was a little in liquor, I went in to buy something, and another woman came in after me, and he said, he could not serve two at once; and then the prosecutor's wife said, there was a mouse in my bosom; upon that, this other woman ran away, and the prosecutor went out after her; when he came back again, he brought a constable, and took me into custody; I do not know any thing of the property being upon the ground.

Q. to 
               
                  James 
                  Barrack 
               



            . Do you know these Prisoners at the Bar? What have you to say against them?
Barrack. On the 10th Day of February, about eight o'Clock in the Evening, I saw two Women running along the Strand, with each of them a Hoop-petticoat under their Arm, and they went up Helmet-Court, next Door to my House; I told my Daughter I believed they had stole two Hoop-petticoats, for there was none in that Court that wore such. When I went up the Court, they were rolling of them up; when I came to them, I took hold of each Hoop-petticoat , I told them I believed they had stole them; upon that one of them says to the other, take my Hoop-petticoat , and I will go and call my Mistress that will tell how I came by them. It was 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Goff 
               



             , the Prisoner, that said she would go and fetch her Mistress, so she run away, but did not come back again .
Q. What did you do then?
Barrack. Then I brought the other Prisoner, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Capell 
               



            , down to my Shop, and asked her if she knew nothing of the other Girl; she said she met the Prisoner, Goff , in Catharine street , she said she had no Money, but she should carry one of the Hoops. I sent for the Constable when she would not own who they belonged to, so I went for the Constable, which is now in Court, and we had her before Justice Burdus , and she confessed that 
               
                  Mary 
                  Goff 
               



             was her Partner, and that they had taken them from one Mrs Jones's Shop in Russel-street . When Goff was taken about a Month afterwards, she confessed before the Justice that she was the Person concerned with Capell in taking these Hoops.
- Mason, Constable. About eight o'Clock at Night , the 10th of February, Mr Barrack sent to my House, and desired I would come to his House , for he had stopped a Thief ; I carried her before Justice Burdus, the Justice ordered me to lock her up that Night, and bring her the next Day to be examined. As I saw a great many Hoops in Mrs Jones's Shop, I asked her whether she had lost any Hoops, she said she could not tell whether she had or no; I told her about ten o'Clock a Person would be before the Justice, and she might see two Hoops.
Court . In the first Place

            , Prisoner, what have you to say to this Fact?
Capell. I met Goff , and she desired me to go a little Way with her, and she would make me Amends for it.
Goff . I know of no such Thing.

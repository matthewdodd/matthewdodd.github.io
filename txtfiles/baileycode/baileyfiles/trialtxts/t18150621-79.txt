, and servant to Cox and Co.
 I live at Mile End, Old Town. On the 13th of May, between eleven and twelve at night, I was going home and saw the prisonerat the bar and another woman the corner of George Yard, she marked me to give her some gin; I told I had no gin money and walked on; she followed me, and just as I got in the corner of Angel-alley


, she laid hold of my right arm, put her hand under my apron and picked my pocket of this money. I demanded my property of her, and she would not give it to me, and I called the watch. The watchman came and took her into custody.

            . The prisoner stop'd me between Copenhagen-house


 and Kentish-Town


. He was in soldier's cloaths. It was between five and seven in the evening, on the 21st of June; he had a hanger in his hand, and demanded my money.
Q. Was the hanger drawn?
Arnold. No, it was in the scabbard. I told him I had none. He said he'd search my pockets, which he did, but found nothing; then he demanded my cloaths (I had observed he had drawn his hanger two or three times before he stop'd me.) I pleaded very hard, and said I had been ill many months, and they were very bad. He took my hat off my head by force, and seeing it not a good one he returned it to me again. I went up to Copenhagen-house and told the case. Two men went down the field and found him. Then he was carried before a magistrate and committed.
Prisoner. Did I offer any violence to you? you yourself turn'd your pockets.
Prosecutor. You did not hurt me.

                  Turner 
               



            . I was in the fields, when the prosecutor was fishing in a pond. I saw a soldier. After that I was at Copenhagen-house, where the prosecutor told me he had been stop'd by a soldier. I and another man went after him, and took him in the very same field. He made no opposition.
The prisoner had nothing to say for himself.



               Guilty

Thomas Day. On the 10th of last June I was at Billingsgate


, about twelve o'clock. I had taken my handkerchief out of my breast pocket to wipe my fingers, having handled some mackerel, and put it into my coat pocket. In a minute's time 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Yates 
               



             said to me, Have you not lost your handkerchief? I felt, and said I had. He told me he'd shew me the person that had it, and took me to Darkhouse-lane, where he pointed to the prisoner. I went and charged him with it, but he denied it. I then went to take him into an alehouse, and observing his hand in his pocket I pull'd it out. He had my handkerchief in his hand, and I took it just as he was going to drop it (produced in court, and deposed to.)

                  Yates 
               



             confirm'd the account given by the prosecutor.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.




               Guilty 10 d.

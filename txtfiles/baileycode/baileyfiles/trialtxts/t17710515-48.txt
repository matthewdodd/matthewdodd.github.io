            . I lost this cordage out of my ship, which lay at Lime-house dock


; it was to have gone out of the dock that day; the prisoner was assisting to get her out; when the cordage was lost, he confessed he took it and sold it; he said he thought it was of no value.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was drunk and stupid when I said so; I had not victuals and drink allowed me when I was at work; I thought I had a right to have it.

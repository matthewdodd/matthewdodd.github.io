            . On the 29th of July I was walking along Lombard-Street


, and apprehending I felt something at my pocket, clapp'd my hand down and miss'd my handkerchief. I turned round and saw the prisoner at the bar was near me. I saw my handkerchief in her hand, and took hold on her. She said, she pick'd it up from the ground, and falling on her knees desired I'd let her go. The handkerchief produced in court.
Q. Was any other person near you at the time?
Staple. No, not so near me as she.
Q. What is the value of your handkerchief?
Staple. It is worth 2 s. it is almost new.
Prisoner's defence.
There were many other persons going along besides me, and I pick'd it up.




               Guilty 10 d.

THOMAS ALLUM
 and 




HENRY RUSH
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
25th of February, 25 yards of merino, value 1l. 16s., the goods of 



John Hollick.






JOHN KARBY
. I live next door to Mr. Hollick, in High-street, Poplar. On the 26th of February I saw the prisoner Allum run away from his shop, with the merino under his arm—when he had run about twenty yards, he joined Rush, who was at the corner of a turning, and tried to conceal the property under his apron—Rush could see the prosecutor's shop from where he stood—as soon as they saw me they ran away up different passages, and up Bow-lane—I then found Allum in a passage, I

put my hand on his shoulder, and he dropped the merino at my feet, and ran into the arms of my neighbour, who was with me—Rush ran off, but was brought to the station-house in about five minutes—this is the merino—(looking at it.)





SUTTON EDWARD CROW
. I ant in the service of Mr. John Hollick—I saw this merino safe at the shop, on the top step, about twelve o'clock that day—I did not see the prisoner take it.





JOSEPH BARK
. I was at my top-room window, which is next door but one to the prosecutor's—I saw Rush stand at a distance, and give a nod to Allum—I went down stairs, and just as I got into my shop, I saw Karby run past—I ran with him, and took Allum—I took him to the station-house, and as there was no policeman there, my son went out and took Rush, who had been watching Allum going to the station-house.

Rush. Q. Had you your window open, that you could see me nod at him? A. My window was not open, but I saw you quite distinctly; you were on the other side, and you tried to put your apron over the property.

Rush's Defence. I was' going to the East India Docks, a man came and said he wanted me, and I walked with him to the station-house.

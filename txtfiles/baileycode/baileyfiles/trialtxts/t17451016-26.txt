 by the Victualling Office; the Prisoner came for half a pint of beer, and went into the yard to the necessary house, and picked up four plates and a cover for a saucepan; she concealed the plates under her short cloak, and the cover of the saucepan in her pocket. My daughter looked out of a window, and saw her take them.
Alkins (Mr. Minton's servant ) said that the plates were taken from under her cloak, and the sauce-pan cover from under her petticoat .

ELIZA BILHAM
. I am a widow, and keep a tobacco-shop in Percival-street, Clerkenwell. I had this desk in my shop on the 9th of April; it was taken away, and brought back again without my missing it.





JOHN OFFER
. I was in the neighbourhood, and met the prisoner with this desk, attempting to conceal it—I called to him after he had passed me—he ran off, and dropped it in the road—I pursued, and brought him back to the shop—the desk was brought back, I cannot tell by whom.





WILLIAM ELLIOTT
. I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner—the desk had been brought into the shop.

Prisoner's Defence. A young man asked me to carry it; he said he would give me 3d., and I being out of work, carried it—I heard the alarm, and he told me to throw it down, and run away, which I did.





JOHN OFFER
. There was a young man with him, and they both ran away.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

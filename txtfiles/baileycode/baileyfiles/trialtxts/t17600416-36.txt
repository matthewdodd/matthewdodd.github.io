            , and live in Newtoner's Street, High Holbourn


. The prisoner took a lodging of me two years ago, and quitted it in July, the same year, and took the key away with her. Then I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and I never saw her till the 12th of March, when she was taken up. We took her before the justice, where she owned she had taken the things mentioned, and told us where she had pawn'd them, which was at a pawnbroker's by Queen Street, near Holbourn, but he is since run away.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.



               Guilty

JOHN DAVIS
 was indicted

for stealing on the 
14th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



Thomas Griffin, from his person.






THOMAS GRIFFIN
. I live at Beals' Wharf, Tooley-street. On the 14th of October I was in Duke-street, Southwark, about eight o'clock in the evening and observed somebody touch my stick with their foot—I turned round and saw the prisoner running away—I put my hand to my pocket and my handkerchief was gone—I immediately pursued him to the first arch-way of the rail-road—he crept under the rail into the street—I collared him, but found nothing on him—I took him across to the rains where he had run in, and within about two feet of where I took him I found my handkerchief—there was nobody within ten or twelve yards of him—nobody else could have put it there.

Prisoner. There were five or six lads on the ruins. Witness. Nobody crossed the ruins but himself—I took him over the same ground as he ran, and found the handkerchief.





JOHN FALLAS
 (police-constable M 122.) I produce the handkerchief, which I received from the prosecutor—I took the prisoner into custody—I saw nothing of the transaction.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you see several lads about there? A. After you were brought to me a crowd gathered round—I was not near the spot.

JURY
to
MR. GRIFFIN. Q. How far was he off when you pursued him? A. I had lost a handkerchief on the same spot, before I overtook him, and found my handkerchief—I left it in the officer's possession—I ran about 115 paces—(I measured it afterwards)—it is impossible any one else could have taken it—I am quite certain no other lads were about at the time—it was cleverly done—my pocket was inside and I did not feel the least of it




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

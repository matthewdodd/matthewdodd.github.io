 for about three months - I desired him to take a pair of trousers to be cleaned.
RICHARD RUSSELL. I am shopman

            . I am an officer. I went to Mr. Thompson's in consequence of the loss of some stockingsand other things; Mr. Thompson asked the prisoner what he had done with the trousers; he said he had given them to a cobler to pawn; the purse was found on him by a person they have had as porter since the prisoner. He said the tickets and the purse were his own, and that the 3 pairs of stockings, which one of the duplicates is for, he had bought of his master.

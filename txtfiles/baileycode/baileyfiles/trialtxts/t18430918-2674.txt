LUCY MITCHELL
. I am the wife of George Mitchell, and live in Grosvenor-place, Pimlico. On the 29th of Aug. I missed a picture and frame—I went out, and saw the prisoner running with it—I am sure he is the man—he was taken, and threw it down.





ROBERT NOYES
. I was in Wilton-mews, and saw the prisoner running with this picture under his arm—he dropped it, and it was picked up.





JOSEPH PURCELL
 (police-constable B 115.) I took the prisoner, and produce the picture.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Grosvenor-place; I ran after a horse; Lynch saw me, and called "Stop thief;" I waited; he collared me, and said he thought I had something about me, but I had not.





ROBERT M'KENZIE
 (police-constable B 44.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

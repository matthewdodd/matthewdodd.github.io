CLEMENT CHEESE. I am a silversmith
, and live in Clerkenwell


, the prisoner was in my service. On the 1st of March I found I was deficient in my stock, and on the 3d I was deficient again; I told her on the Sunday that I was deficient, and I would know who it was - on the Monday I told her I was short again, and I would see in her box; she said, she was never called a thief before - I said, if she had nothing of mine, she could not object to my seeing her box; she hesitated - I went up stairs with my errand-boy; she opened her box and took out a small paper parcel, which she tried to put into her pocket - the boy stopped her hand, and we found it was this piece of silver; I told the boy to empty out the box, and we found some more silver - she fell on her knees and begged forgiveness; here is an ancient coin among it, which I know well, and a piece of an ingot; she only lived eleven days with me, and came from the office in Holborn.(Property produced and sworn to.)

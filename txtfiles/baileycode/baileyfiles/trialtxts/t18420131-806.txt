EUGENE M'CARTHY
 and 



JAMES NICHOLSON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
29th of January, 42lbs. weight of canvass, value 10s., the goods of 



Samuel Burchfield; and that Nicholson had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD DOWNES
. I am in the employ of Mr. Samuel Burch field. On Friday last I missed some canvass which I had seen safe on the poles at his place at Poplar—this now produced is it.





DANIEL SULLIVAN
 (police-constable K 127.) I produce this canvass—I saw M'Carthy with it on the night of the 29th of January—Nicholson was with him, and he had a basket on his shoulder containing rope, us it appeared to me—I met them both—they parted in a moment, one ran one way, and the other the other—I followed M'Carthy, and brought him back to where he had thrown the bag which contained this canvass off his shoulder—I asked where he got it—he said from his brother—I asked who his brother was—he said, "Nicholson."





JOHN HABGOOD
 (police-constable K 109.) I assisted Sullivan to the station with M'Carthy—Nicholson was afterwards taken in a privy—he said at the station that the canvass came from Mr. Burchfield's.

M'Carthy's Defence. A man asked me to carry it, and said it came from Mr. Burchfield's.

Nicholson's Defence. I left my work at half-past seven; I went home to wash myself; I then met a man, who asked us to carry this and the rope.





JOHN SIMPSON
 (police-constable K 25.) I produce a certificate of Nicholson's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.
(M'Carthy received a good character.)

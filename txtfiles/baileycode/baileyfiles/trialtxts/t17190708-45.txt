            , the 17th of June
 last. It appeared that the Prisoner was the Prosecutor's Servant
 and related to him; and that between 4 and 5 a Clock in the Morning, he was seen to carry away the Goods, whereupon his Master examined him about them and the Prisoner wish'd the Devil might take him if he knew of more than 10 Skins, which he said he pawn'd for 3 s. and would have gone by himself to redeem them, but his Master and his Friend who inform'd him of it would go with him; that they went together till they came to Mr. Churcher's Shop on London-Bridge, where the Prisoner went in, and in a little while the Master and his Friend, who told Mr. Churcher that he must needs thrive if he could buy such Bargains as 10 Skins for 3 s. to which he reply'd he did not buy 10 Skins for 3 s. but a dozen and 10 Skins for 11 s. that the Prisoner told him (Mr. Churcher) that he would sell his Goods cheaper than ordinary because he was a new Beginner; and he told him that if he would sell a Pennyworth, his Shop was his Market, and he would buy them. The Prisoner denyed the Fact, and said that he sold none without his Master's Order, who had rais'd this Prosecution to get Money out of Churcher. But the Evidence being full against him, the Jury found him 

               Guilty

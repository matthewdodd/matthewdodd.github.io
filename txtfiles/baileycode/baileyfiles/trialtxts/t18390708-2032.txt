HENRY DREW
. On Thursday, the 27th of June, I was walking from Bridge-street to the Temple, passing through Fisher-alley, and when near the Temple, a gentleman said, "Have you not been robbed, sir?"—I missed my handkerchief, and went in search of the prisoner, and not finding him, the gentleman gave me a description of him, and left—I was then returning to the Temple, when I recognized the prisoner, from the description—I accused him of having robbed me in the alley a short time before—he became uneasy, and ran away—I followed and caught him—the policeman came, and I gave him in charge—I should think it was from ten to fifteen minutes after losing my handkerchief, that I overtook him—he was taken to the station-house, and three handkerchiefs found on him, one of which was mine—this is it—it has my initials on it—it was in my pocket that that morning.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How long have you had it? A. Perhaps six months—I am sure I used it that morning.





WILLIAM WILLIAMS
 (City police-constable, No. 174.) I took the prisoner, and found this handkerchief and two more on him—there is G. I. P. on one of the others—the other hat no mark.

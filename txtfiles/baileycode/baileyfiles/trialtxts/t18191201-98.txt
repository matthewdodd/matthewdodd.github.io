            . On the 28th of October, about a quarter after nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Holborn with another woman, they accosted me, and asked for something to drink; I said No, for I was going to Aldgate. When I was in Brook-street


 they wanted me to go with them, I said I could not, and turned down a court to get out of their way. The prisoner took my watch out, and gave it to another woman. I held her - the people said,
"Let her go!" She struck me with force; I still held her. The watchman came up, and I gave her in charge. As we went along she said if I did not keep off she would fetch me down. I did not intend to go any where with her. I was sober.

            . I am a watchman. I was in Brook-street, heard the cry in Fox-court


, and saw the prosecutor, who had hold of the prisoner, and gave her in charge for robbing him of his watch and giving it to another girl.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a mob, and went to see what was the matter - the prosecutor was being ill-used by some men, I persuaded him to come away, and he gave me in charge.

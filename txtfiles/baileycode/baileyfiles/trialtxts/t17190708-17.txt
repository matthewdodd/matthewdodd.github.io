                        Shipwrang 
                     



, on the 11th of June
 last. It appear'd that th e Prisoner and Holliday took a Room in the House of Mr. Shipwrang in Water-lane in White-Fryers


, and were to give two Shillings per Week for it; that Holiday went to the Prosecutor's Shop to cheapen Goods, and agreed with him for those mentioned in the Indictment for ready Money, and after the Bill of Parcels was writ out and cast up, which came to the Sum above mentioned, said he had not Money enough about him to pay for them, but if he would send his Man with him to his Lodging in Water-lane he would pay him for them there on the delivery of the Goods; that accordingly he sent his Man along with him, charging him not to deliver them with out the Money; that Holliday carry'd the Man to the George Alehouse in the same Lane, and afterwards up to his new Lodging, which they had not taken above two Hours before, and bid him lay the Goods down upon the Table, and go to the same Ale-house and he would come and pay him, and make him drink for his Trouble in waiting; that accordingly he went, and Holliday after him, leaving word with his new Landlady, that if the Prisoner came, to send him to him, that as soon as they were gone the Prisoner came, and the Landlady told him that Holliday wanted to speak with him at the said Alehouse; but the Prisoner said that he must first go up and fetch the Cloth, it being for a Gentleman who was just going out of Town; that while the Prisoner went up Stairs for the Cloth, she went to the Alehouse to Holliday, and told him what the Prisoner said; and that Holliday reply'd, it was very well, let him have it; and when she came back met the Prisoner coming down with the Goods, who carry'd them off, and her new Lodgers never came any more. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded, that he carry'd the Goods to Holliday's Wife by his Order, and produced Evidence to his Reputation, who also swore they saw him deliver them to Holliday's Wife; and to prove that the Goods were bought and not stole, produced a Bill of Parcels own'd by the Prosecutor; but the Condition of Sale, being for ready Money and the Goods not to be deliver'd till paid for, the Property thereof was not transferr'd from the Prosecutor till the Money for them should be received; and it plainly appearing that it was a Felonious Intention of Holliday and the Prisoner to steal the Prosecutor's Goods, without giving him any Money for them, and he being a very notorious Offender that way, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

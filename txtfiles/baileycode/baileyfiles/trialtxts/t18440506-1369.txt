FREDERICK WOOD
 was indicted

 for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



Henry Pearce, at 
St. Dunstan Stebonheath, alias Stepney, and stealing therein, 1 shawl, value 2s. 6d.; 1 counterpane, 1s.; 1 sheet, 6d.; 1 night-gown, 4d.; 1 cap, 2d.; and 1/4 yard of flannel, 1l.; his goods; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HANNAH PEARCE
. I am the wife of Henry Pearce, and live in Dunstan-street, Stepney. I made the bed on the 18th of April, and left the front room about eight o'clock—these articles now produced were then safe—I went into the kitchen about a quarter-past eight, and then went outside to close the shutters—the window was partly up, and the bed things were taken off the bed—when I left they were all on the bed, and the window closed—these things are all my husband's—it is our dwelling-house; we live and sleep there.





GEORGE MURRAY
 (police-constable K 68.) I produce the articles—at about half-past eight o'clock I stopped the prisoner with them near the George public-house, about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's—I asked what he had there—he said two gowns, and was going to take them to his sister's—I asked where he got them—he said he was going to take them, from one sister to another—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not leave off work till eight o'clock; a person named James Leech, who worked for my employer, asked me to carry these things for him as far as the Roebuck; I told the policeman I was carrying them for my workmate; the man has never been at work since.





JOSEPH PRICE
 (police-constable H 15.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the man that was tried and convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

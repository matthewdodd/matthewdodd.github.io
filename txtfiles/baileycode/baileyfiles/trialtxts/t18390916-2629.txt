JOSEPH MOSELEY
. I live at the Northampton Arms, public-house, Gotwell-road. On the 25th of August, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I went out with my beer, and left my jacket on the door in the wash-house—in the pocket was a knife and the money stated—when I returned I found the prisoner in custody of the officer—-some of my farthings were shook out on the floor—this is my jacket.





LEONARD MAGNESS
. I was in front of the bar—I had suspicion of the prisoner, and watched him—he went into the wash-house, took the jacket, and put it into his pocket—I went and told the bar-man, and he went out at one door, and the prisoner at the other—he brought him back with the jacket.





GEORGE DAWES
. I am a saw-maker. I was at the bar—the prisoner Pushed against me—I turned round, and the bar-man ran and brought him back—he said he was an honest man, and after some time he pulled out the jacket himself, and five farthings fell out of it.

Prisoner. I am guilty of stealing the jacket and the eight farthings, but the knife was my own.





JOHN CAYFORD
. (police-constable E 97.) I produce a certificate of the

prisoner's former conviction, and he had been convicted before that—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

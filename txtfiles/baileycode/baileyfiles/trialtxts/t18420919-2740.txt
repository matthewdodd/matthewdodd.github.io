SARAH VANT
. I am the daughter of Francis William Vant, a linendraper—his dwelling-house is in the parish of Woolwich. On the 22nd of August the prisoner came into the shop—I served her and missed a piece of silk when she had left, which I had seen safe on the counter about five minutes before—this now produced is it—it is my father's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was anybody else in the shop at the time? A. Yes, a great many customers—there was one young woman near the silk, but she went out before the prisoner, and I saw the silk safe after that young woman went out—no one went out from the time I saw it safe until it was found on the prisoner.





THOMAS DAVIES
. I am apprentice to Mr. Vant—I went after the prisoner, who had got about thirty yards from the shop—I told her she had got something that did not belong to her—she said she had not—I took her shawl aside and saw this roll of black silk.

Cross-examined. Q. Where did you overtake the prisoner? A. Standing inside a public-house next door to the baker's shop—she said a young woman had given it her—she did not know who.




GUILTY
.* Aged 27.—


Transported for Ten Years.

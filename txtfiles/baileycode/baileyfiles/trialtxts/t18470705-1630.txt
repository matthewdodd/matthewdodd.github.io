1630. 




JOHN WHITE
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 shovel, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



William Bond; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM BOND.
 I am in the employ of Mr. Dodd—I had a shovel safe on the 1st of July—I left it at the side of my cart, in Lothbury—I missed it about a quarter-past one o'clock—this is it.





RICHARD BRACEY.
 I am at work for Mr. Gould, a dust-contractor. On the 1st July I was in White Rose-court, Coleman-street—I saw the prisoner coming along with this shovel on his shoulder—I suspected, stopped him, and asked where he had got it from—he said a man had given it to him—I look it from him—the name of Forster is on it.

Prisoner. I was by the Bank; a man gave me this shovel, as he said it was of no use to him, he was going hay-making.





JOSEPH CULLUM
 (police-constable 239.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 11th of May, 1846, (having been before convicted of felony;) and confined one year)—he is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ELIZABETH BROWN
, was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of March, 1 blanket, value 1s., the goods of 



Andrew Wyness; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






CATHERINE WYNESS
. I am twelve years old. I know I must tell the truth. I live with my father and mother, in East-street, Manchester-square. About eight o'clock, on the 24th of March, I was going in doors, and saw the prisoner coming out with a blanket and a shift under her arm, hanging down by her side—I said, "Don't shut the door"—she pushed me down, and shut the door—a gentleman stopped her directly.





THOMAS DICKENS
. I was called out by Catherine Wyness—she begged some one to stop the prisoner, and I stopped her in Paddington-street—she had a bundle—she brought it back to East-street, and threw it into the prosecutrix's lap.





ELIZABETH WYNESS
. I am the wife of Andrew Wyness. About ten minutes past eight o'clock the prisoner was brought back to my house—she had a bundle—she threw the things into my hands, and said, "There is them all—pray forgive me"—this blanket is mine—it had been hanging on a line.

Prisoner. I beg for mercy; distress drove me to it.






JOHN SHOVELLER
 (police-constable D 155.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried then, and she had been tried before that.




GUILTY
. Aged 43.—


Transported for Seven Years.

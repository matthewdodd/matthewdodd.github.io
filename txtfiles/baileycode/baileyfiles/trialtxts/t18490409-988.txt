ROBERT RANDALL
. I live in Goodman's-fields. On 20th March, about ten minutes past three o'clock, I was on Tower-hill, looking at the soldiers, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and put it into his trowsers pocket—the gentleman walked away—I gave the prisoner in charge.





WILLIAM COOPER
 (policeman, H 198). Randall pointed out the prisoner to me—he ran away, a man stopped him—I took him, and felt his pockets, bat could find no handkerchief—he said he had not taken no handkerchief—we had not walked many yards before it came out at the bottom of his trowsers—he said at the station a man gave it him.





DANIEL LYONS
 (policeman). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted Aug., 1847—having been before convicted—confined twelve months)—I was present—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

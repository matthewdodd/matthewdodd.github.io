. I am a bricklayer, and was at work at a building in the Clapham-road on the 21st of Jan.—I was coming from dinner, and met the prisoner coming out of the building with something in a handkerchief—he saw me, and he dropped it and ran—I ran and took him—I went back to the place where I saw him drop something, and found this plough—he begged me to let him go—I kept him till the carpenters came, and they detained him.





JAMES NEWMAN

I am a labourer to a bricklayer
; I lost that money, eight guineas, sixteen half guineas and a crown. I lost it next Sunday will be a fortnight, I lodge in Mr. Hartley's house, I have a room there; I left the money in the tick of the bed, which I thought was the safest place, I saw it there the day before I lost it; the two prisoners came to me on Monday night, to lodge with me, in my room; they came as man and wife; I did not know them before, they staid with me a week, and paid for their lodgings, I missed the money on the Sunday before they went; the money was not marked, and I found a hole in the tick, the prisoners had a key to the door.

Court. Did you ever take an oath? - Yes before the justice.
Do you (now what will become of you, if you don't tell the truth? - Go to hell Sir.
I am son of the Prosecutor, the woman spent a guinea, the day after she left us, she came after me, and asked me to have something to drink, and gave me two pence and a glass of shrub not to tell where she was; she said I was always a good boy, and not to say I saw her at all.

             sworn.
I am a soldier's widow; I was in the public house when the two prisoners were there, and I said to her, what makes you here? says she, I am a prisoner, says I, what have you done; why, says she, I was nursing a woman, and there were sixteen guineas and a crown, and I took it, and I will make use of it, and let the old b - h go and get more; I am sure she said sixteen guineas, but nothing about any half guineas, when she came out of the Justice's she took two guineas and a half, and four shillings out of the corner of her handkerchief, and gave it to the man; the man said nothing to me, nor I to him.
Do you know whether they are man and wife? - No, Sir.

            . On the seventh of January, about eight at night, going down Cornhill


, I thought I felt something at my pocket; I turn'd back, there stood the prisoner, I missed my handkerchief, then I laid my hand on his shoulder, and ask'd him if he had not took it: he made no answer; I put my hand into his pocket, and found my handkerchief there. (He shewed four taken out of the prisoner's pocket, one of which he took, and deposed to he his property.)
Q. When had you your handkerchief last?
Laboure. I knew I had it in my pocket not a quarter of an hour before.
Prisoner's defence.
A boy told him I had picked his pocket; I saw him throw it away; I took it up, when he asked me if I had not picked his pocket; I told him I had found one, and if it was his, he should have it and welcome.

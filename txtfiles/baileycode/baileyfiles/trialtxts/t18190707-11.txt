            . I am clerk to Mr. Marks, who is a soap-boiler
, and lives in York-street, Westminster. On the 20th of June, I was in Catherine-street, Strand, opposite Bedford-court


; the prisoner and two or three others came up. The prisoner snatched my watch from my pocket and ran up Bedford-court; I followed and overtook him - he could not get away, but turned round, and struck at me; he missed his blow, and I collared him. While I held him a woman came out of one of the houses in the court, and took hold of my coat behind; I heard something fall like a watch, and glass break - the woman picked it up and took it away; I have never recovered the watch - I am sure the prisoner took it. He got away, leaving the flaps of his coat in my hand. I pursued and overtook him again - the watchman stopped him.
Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman pushed me against the wall - I am innocent.

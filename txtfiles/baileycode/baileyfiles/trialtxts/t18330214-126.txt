; the prisoner was a lodger of mine. On the 26th of January, I missed a pair of sugar-tongs; I asked him about it, he denied knowing any thing about them, but at dinner-time one of my other lodgers turned to him and said, "You must know something about them, you may as well confess;" he then gave up the duplicate and said, "I may as well give it up" - I went and got the tongs.

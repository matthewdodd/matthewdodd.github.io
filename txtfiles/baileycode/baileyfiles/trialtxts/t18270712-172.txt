            . I was coming from the west end of the town, and saw Williamson laying down asleep, and the prisoner rifling his pockets - she then took off his hat, and attempted to put it under her clothes; she put it under her left arm, covered it with her shawl, and went up Chiswell-street - I called the watchman, who took her.

            . I took in the prisoner in order to keep her from starving in the streets. I missed a camblet gown about six weeks ago, I charged her with taking of it, she owned she had taken it, and pawned it to Mr. Trippet a pawnbroker.
Mr. Trippet. I am a pawnbroker, (he produced a camblet gown) this I had of the prisoner at the bar.
Q. What did you lend her upon it?
Trippet. I lent her half a guinea upon it.
Prisoner's defence.
The prosecutrix gave me leave to carry the gown to pawn.
Q. to prosecutrix. Did you give the prisoner leave to carry the gown to pawn?
Prosecutrix. She never asked me to lend her sixpence, or for the gown, neither did she pawn it by my direction.

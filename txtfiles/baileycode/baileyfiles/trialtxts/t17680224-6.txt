            . I live in Prince's street, Aldermanbury


, I am a warehouse-man
; we having at sundry times missed goods on mornings between seven and nine, my wife got into a little counting-house in order to watch last Wednesday morning; she called out thief; I was up stairs, I came down; she had shut the prisoner into the warehouse; there were some neighbours upon hearing her came; we took him out and secured him.
Mrs. Chapman. I took an opportunity to sit in the little counting-house on the inside the passage, about nine last Wednesday morning last; I saw the prisoner come cross the street; he opened the door and came in, and went into the warehouse, and went to the farther side, and took two pieces of cloth up from a pile of goods; I clapped the door to, and called thief; when help came and we opened the door, we found the two pieces on the table, he had laid them there; (produced in court.)
Prosecutor. We call it quilted everlasting.
Prisoner's defence.
I knocked at the outward door, nobody came; I went in, and the warehouse door stood half open, I knocked there, nobody came, so I went in; in order to see an acquaintance, and they shut me in.

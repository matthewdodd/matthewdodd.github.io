            . I am a butcher
. On the 9th of January I lost about 7lbs. of beef, from a board inside my window-shutter; I was out at the time - I went out at eight o'clock, and returned about eleven; I went to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner - I saw my beef at Worship-street.
JOHN BUTT. I had information that the prisoner and another had laid a plan to rob this shop; I went to my door, and saw the prisoner take the beef; he came towards me, and I caught him in my arms - he threw it down, and endeavoured to escape by kicking.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the shop, and saw a bit of beef on the ground; I was stooping to pick it up, when the witness came and caught me.

            , ESQ.
 On the 19th of January, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in New-street


, returning from Somerset-place; I felt something at my pocket, put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief. I turned round, and saw two people on my left - one got off the pavement, and the prisoner went into the middle of the street, with something like my handkerchief in his hand. I charged him with taking it; he denied it, and I seized him. He put his hand behind him - I turned him round, and he let my handkerchief fall. I picked it up, and gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I never had it.

            . I am a broker, and was in Longalley. I observed the prisoner and another following Mr. Aldridge, who had a female with him, and near the end of Long-lane I saw the other take the handkerchief out of Aldridge's pocket, and pass it behind to the prisoner, who went into a shop - I stopped Aldridge, and told him; Cadby went in, and took the prisoner; the other ran away - I took Aldridge to the shop where the prisoner was.
JOSEPH CADBY. I am a constable. I was in Longlane, with Colton; the prisoner, and another followed the prosecutor; they made several attempts; at last the other got the handkerchief out, and gave it to the prisoner, who went into a shop - I went, and took him; I found the handkerchief under his coat; I do not think I should know the other.(Property produced and sworn
Prisoner. I hope the prosecutor will recommend me to mercy.

JOHN OLIVER. I am an upholsterer

. I lost some rush-matting on the 14th of September, between two and three o'clock, while I was at dinner- I had seen it safe an hour or two before.

            . I live in Leathersellers' Alms-houses. I was standing to rest my basket, opposite Mr. Oliver's door; I saw the prisoner go into the shop empty-handed, and come out with a roll of matting on his shoulder - I went in and told Shaw, who was rubbing chairs at the bottom of the shop. I am certain of his person; he was alone.

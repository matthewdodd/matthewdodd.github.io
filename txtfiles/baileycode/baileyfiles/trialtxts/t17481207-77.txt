            . I am a grocer
; I lost four pounds of starch the 15th of Oct. about nine at night. I was sitting by the fire, and I heard my window break; I ran out after the Prisoner, and met with him near Well Close square, it was accidental I found him; I imagined he was gone that way, so I kept going on. I looked into a shop, there I saw the Prisoner at the bar; he asked the person of the shop if he would buy any starch, saying, he would sell it very cheap. I went in, and took hold of him, and said, you have broke my window; he said, can you swear that?
Q. Was it all in one paper?
Deboust. Yes, my Lord, I carried him to the Red Lyon, and desired the landlord to send for a watchman. We had one came, then I sent him to the watch-house. The next day we took him to Justice Manwaring.
Q. Did he confess any thing there?
Deboust. No, my Lord, he said he found it on the step of my door.

            . I live at Hounslow


 ; the prisoner was my servant
 to carry for me ; I am a Scotch pedlar
. On the 11th of last month I was coming to London, and left some goods at Brentford, I order'd the prisoner to bring some of them to me to the Castle at Hammersmith ; he did not come; he took the goods I had lost there, and others I had left at Hounslow, which were in the room where he lay, and went off. The goods mention'd in the indictment were the goods he took from the 2 places, (mention'd them over.) He and the goods being missing, I advertised him, and them he was taken with the goods upon him at Morpesh ; I sent the warrant after him, he was brought up to London, and the goods too ; I have got them all. (Produc'd in court, and depos'd to) I took the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor, he confess'd taking the goods; the waistcoat was found on his back.
The prisoner had nothing to say for himself.

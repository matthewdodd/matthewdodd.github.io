            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the prosecutor's house, to apprehended the prisoner, on the 22d of December, about four o'clock; I asked where he lodged - he went with me, and shewed me his box, which I opened, and found these articles - he said he found the tips in sweeping the shop, and took the ferrules from a drawer.

. The prisoner was in my employ, as an errand-boy
, for three weeks. My wife sent for the officer, and had him taken - I can swear to part of this property, but not all; I always told him if he found any thing to put them into the drawer, as I would prosecute any person I found robbing me, having so many persons about me.

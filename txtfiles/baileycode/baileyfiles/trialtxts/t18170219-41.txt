            . About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 5th of February, I saw the prisoner, with two boys, he was making signs to them to take a ham - They attempted it two or three times, but did not take it; the prisoner appeared to be in a passion with them; he was about four yards from the cheese; one of the boys was about four years of age, the other about eighteen. My wife told me that the cheese was taken, I turned round, and saw the prisoner put it under his arm.

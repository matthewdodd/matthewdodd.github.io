            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Frederick 
                  Fondling
               



             and live in Old Montague-street


. On the 11th of June, I was putting my fruit out of window - the prisoner came by; I asked her in and shewed her this cap, which I was going to put some lace on. I put it in the box and she went away, but returned in ten minutes, and asked me to fetch her something to drink. I called my girl to fetch a quartern of gin; she told me not to send the child, it looked so foolish, but to go myself. I went to the public-house, two doors off, returned, she drank it, and went away in a hurry, and said she would call about two or three o'clock. In about ten minutes I missed the cap; next day I saw her pass and stopped her - she denied it; a gentleman came up, she then called me aside and said she did take it, and gave me an affidavit of it.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 18th June, the prisoner pawned the cap for 3 s.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I pawned it by her desire to get money for drink; she afterwards went with me to get the duplicate altered in her name. After I was in charge, she said, if I could get 20 s. she would set me at liberty.

            . Nothing of the kind passed.

            . I never gave it her to pawn, her defence is false.

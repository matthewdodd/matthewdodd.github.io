            . I know the house of

. About two o'clock, on the 20th of March, I saw the prisoner take this table from just outside his door, and carry it two or three hundred yards, before I secured him - he said nothing; I had seen him lurking about some time.
RICHARD DUNN. The table is mine, and was close by my door - I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman came out of the shop and asked me to carry it to No. 14, Sloane-street - I said the man was on before me, but they would not call him; there was a gentleman in the shop talking to a lady.
Mr. KNIGHT. I passed the door, and saw Mrs. Dunn and a gentleman in conversation - I then took the prisoner; I had watched him for a quarter of an hour - I saw him take up the table; there was no person near him.

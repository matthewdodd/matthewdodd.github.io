            . I am in the silk business, and live in Spital-square. I was passing by Mr. Richards's between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner and two other boys looking at this dress - the biggest boy jumped up and pulled it down, and gave it to the prisoner, who ran down the street with it under his arm. I was fetched to the watch-house next morning, and found the prisoner there. I am certain of him - I kept him in sight a long time.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the evening of the 17th of June, about half past eight o'clock, from the description Mr. Young gave me. I found nothing on him. I was surrounded and ill-used in taking him - it was in a house in Spital-fields, kept by one Levy, where a number of these boys live.

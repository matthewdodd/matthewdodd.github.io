JAMES MERRYFORD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of June, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



William Tyrrell, from his person.






WILLIAM TYRRELL
. I live at the Plough, in Carey-street. On the 2nd of June I was in Fleet-street, at about twenty minutes past nine o'clock in the evening—I perceived something at my pocket, and turned round very quickly, and challenge the prisoner with stealing my handkerchief—while I was doing that, he pt it down by his side, on the pavement—I saw him do it, and gave him into custody.

Prisoner. I did not have it at all, nor see it, till I saw the gentleman pick it up of the grating—he said at the station house that he took it out of my hand. Witness. I did not—I am quite clear, that when I turned round I saw it in his possession—I put up my umbrella, and said, "You scoundrel you have taken my handkerchief," and then he threw it down.





GEORGE BUTLER
. I am patrol or St. Bride's. I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief—at the time I took the prisoner he dropped another handkerchief on one side of him—I took him to the watchhouse, and found two more handkerchiefs in his hat—they are all silk handkerchiefs.

Prisoner's Defence. I am a blacksmith, and worked six months in the London Docks—I was going to Westminster, seeking after another job, but had had a pint or two of beer with my shopmates—I saw the gentleman take this handkerchief up and charge me with taking it: the other three I bought in the morning of a Jew for 11s. 6d.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

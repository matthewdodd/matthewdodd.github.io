            . I am a constable. I was in Wych-street, and saw the prisoner following the prosecutor, who had a gentleman with him. I watched him, and saw him pull the handkerchief out a little way; he turned round to look about him - I was on the opposite side of the way. He then took it quite out; Forbes, who was with me secured him, and took it out of his bosom. I informed the prosecutor.

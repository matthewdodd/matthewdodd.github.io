for stealing, on the

HENRY GODDARD
. I am a surgeon, and live at Putney. On the 5th of October I left my phaeton in Oxford-street, and went to a druggist's shop, leaving a cloak in the phaeton—I came out in about two minutes, and it was gone—this is it—(looking at it,)





JOSEPH DAVIS LEATHART
. I live at No. 19, Bank-place, Bays water. I was near the phaeton—I saw the prisoner and three others walking about, looking at different places, and talking together—they went to where the phaeton was—two of the party stood at the head of the horse—the prisoner and another kept behind—after a few seconds the prisoner and the other went round on the road side, the prisoner then looking cautiously round, went again, and in a dexterous manner drew the cloak from the seat, and gave it to another man—I crossed, and took the man—he struggled violently, and I took the cloak from him—the prisoner turned round, and I let go of the other, and took the prisoner—I said, "You are the thief, I will take you."

Prisoner. He said, "Here is the man that took the horse-cloth." Witness. I thought it was a horse-cloth—the coachman is here, but be did not see it.

Prisoner. I was twelve yards in front of the gig, and he came, laid hold of me, and said, "Here is the thief."




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

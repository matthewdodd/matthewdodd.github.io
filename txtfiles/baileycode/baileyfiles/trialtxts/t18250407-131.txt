JOHN SMITH. I keep the Black-horse public house, Tower-hill




; this pot is mine, the name has been partly scratched out. On the 23d of February, my waiter was cleaning the pots in the yard, and hanging them on a horse before the tap room fire to dry. I saw the prisoner there that morning he had been in the habit of coming in about nine o'clock in the morning; just at the time the pots were before the fire; on that morning I missed a best coffee-room quart pot.

            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 23d of February, I saw the prisoner with a quart pot under his smock frock - I asked where he got it, he said he brought it from Wiltshire - I told him I did not believe it, and should take him before the Magistrate; he then said he had been to Mr. Smith's, and brought the pot from there.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along with the pot, and the officer said
"Where did you come from?" I said from Wiltshire - I told him I got the pot from Mr. Smith; I had been the night before at Mr. Smith's and asked Mrs. Smith, to lend me a pot to take home half a pint of beer - she said
"Yes, but do not let Mr. Smith know it?" I was going to take it home and the officer stopped me.

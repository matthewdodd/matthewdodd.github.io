WILLIAM SHEATH. I am in the employ of Mr. James Brown, a linen-draper
, of High-street, Shadwell


. On the 3rd of November I saw the two prisoners outside the shop, looking in at the window for some time; they then took the pins out of a piece of printed cotton at the door, and folded it up - they went away, and came back to it several times: at last Beavis took it, and walked away - the other was close to her; I followed and took them - they did not say any thing; this is the cotton - there are about twenty yards of it; they moved it several times, to get it into a smaller compass.
Beavis' Defence. He took it and did something to it, and then he brought it out in a small compass, as if he wanted one of us to take it.
Markham's Defence. If I had been guilty I should have resisted; I was standing at the window, looking at an intoxicated man - the gentleman came out, and took me, and instead of using me as a Christian, he used violence; he brought out a string, and tied us both together.

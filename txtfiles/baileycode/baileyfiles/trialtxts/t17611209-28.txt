            . I live with Mr. Wright, Bloomsbury-square


. I missed three guineas out of my box on Sunday night last. I suspected the prisoner, and charged her with taking them; she confessed she did take them. I had seen my money in the box that week.
Q. Where did your box stand?
E. Roads. It stood below stairs, and was locked.
Q. Did you find it broke open?
E. Roads. No, she did it with a key.

                  Gay 
               



            . I am a constable; 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Roads 
               



             brought me a warrant on the 7th of this instant to take up the prisoner; which I did. She was charged with taking three guineas out of a box, and she owned that she had taken the money, and laid most of it out. They were fellow-servants.
Q. How did she say she got at it?
Gay. She said she opened the box with a key of her own.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was frighted; and they proposed to me, that if I would make up the money again, they would make no more to do about it.
Gay. The prisoner confessed she had bought these things with part of the money. (Producing a parcel of cloaths, and the key with which she owned she had opened the lock.) 

               Guilty
            . The cloaths were ordered to be delivered to the prosecutrix.

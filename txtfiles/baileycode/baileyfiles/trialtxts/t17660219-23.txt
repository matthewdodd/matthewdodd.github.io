            . I am a farmer
 at Harefield in Middlesex


, and the prisoner was my servant
; my watch used to hang in my kitchen, to serve instead of a clock. It was missing the first of February, and the prisoner ran away that morning; I persued and took him in a few hours: he had sold it to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Grange 
               



             at Uxbridge, where I found it, by his direction, (produced and deposed to.)


                  Robert 
                  Grange 
               



            . I bought the watch of the prisoner at the bar.
Prisoner's defence.
I picked the watch up at my master's back door.

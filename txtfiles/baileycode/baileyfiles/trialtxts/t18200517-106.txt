            . I am coachman to Lynch White, who is a livery-stable keeper
. On Friday, the 21st of April, I took a glass-coach to Covent-garden Theatre


, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the glass was safe then, on the Sunday following I missed it, I had not examined it before. I found it at St. Giles's watch-house, and compared it with the other - I am sure it is ours. I waited for the company at the Theatre, they came home at half-past ten o'clock.

            . I am a constable. On the 21st of April, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner with two more men - I saw the prisoner shift the glass from one side of him to the other. I followed him into Covent-garden-market, and secured him; one of them said,
"What does that bl - dy b - g - r want?" I took the glass, and secured the prisoner; he said he found it in Russell-street. I advertized it, and the prosecutor claimed it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

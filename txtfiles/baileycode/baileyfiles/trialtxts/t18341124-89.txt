HENRY LLOYD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of November, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Samuel Hanbury, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL HANBURY
. I live in John-street, Bedford-row. On the 5th of November, I was in Gregory-court, Holborn—I felt a twitch at my pocket—I looked very sharply back, and saw the prisoner close behind me, and my handkerchief on the ground—I charged him with stealing it—he denied it, and while I was stooping for the handkerchief, he ran away—I followed him, crying, "Stop thief"—he ran across Brooke's market, and I lost sight of him, but on turning a corner, I found him in custody of a man who keeps a coal-shed—I have no doubt he is the boy who took it, but I should not like to swear to it—there was no other boy running away but him.





EDWARD ASH
. I was in Gregory-court. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and pull out the handkerchief—the prosecutor turned round—there were several boys with the prisoner—I followed him, and did not lose sight of him.





THOMAS CLARK
. (police-constable G 88.) The prisoner was given to me by the coal man.





WILLIAM HOWELL
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—I know he is the man. (read.)

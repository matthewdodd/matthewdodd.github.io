MARY FARRELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of March, 1 1/2 yard of printed cotton, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



George Clarke; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE CLARKE
. I keep a linen-draper's shop in Whitecross-street, St. Luke's. On the Friday after the 16th of March Hayward called to know if I had lost any thing—I had seen the prisoner in my shop on the 16th—I did not miss 'any thing till Hayward came—I saw this printed cotton safe in my shop on Monday morning, the 16th—I had not sold it—I have missed it—it is mine, and has my private mark on it—it was a remnant, and could not be sold without asking me, as the price was not marked.





HARRIET HATWARD
. I am a searcher at the station-house—I was sent for to search the prisoner on Monday evening, the 16th of March—she said she had not a farthing's worth about her, but in her basket I found this print.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought it for 1s. 4d. in his shop; I have a witness to prove it.





THOMAS COTTEE
 (police-constable E 205.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 43.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

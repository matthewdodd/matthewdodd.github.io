            . I live in Ebenezer-square, Houndsditch


, I am a Jew schoolmaster
; the woman at the bar was my servant maid
; she left me the latter end of August; then I looked over my things, and missed the same as laid in the indictment; I met with her about a fortnight ago, at an acquaintance of her's, and took her up; she immediately confessed she had taken them, and pawned them; I found some of them again.

EDWARD WILLIAM GRAY
. About eight o'clock, in the evening of the 13th of May, I was walking with Mr. Gilbert, in the Commercial-road—feeling my pocket witched, I turned round, and saw the prisoner two or three yards off—I advanced towards him—he commenced running—I followed, and saw him drop my handkerchief in the road—when I first turned and saw him, he was standing—I believe, to the best of my knowledge this is my handkerchief—it has no mark on it—my friend pursued and overtook him, and gave him into custody.





SAMUEL GILLETT GILBERT
. I was walking with the prosecutor—I did not see the prisoner till he dropped the handkerchief—I saw him drop it—I then ran and overtook him—he spoke first, and said, "Don't hurt me, I have not got it"—that was before I spoke to him—in a few minutes we met a policeman, and gave him into custody.

Prisoner. I deny speaking to you. Witness. You said, "Don't hurt me, I have not got it."





WILLIAM CARR
 (police-constable H 17). I was on duly in Union-street, and took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.

Prisoner. I had been to Poplar—I saw the handkerchief on the pavement, and took it up—I saw a gentleman coming towards me—I gave it to him, and went away.

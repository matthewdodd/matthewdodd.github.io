            . The Prisoner was my Servant
; and Quantities of my Brass have been taken out of my Shop at several Times; 7 lb. I found at one Mr. Jeddory's and Ironmonger , in St. Giles's. This is the Brass, and I swear to it.
Jeddory. I bought 7 lb. of the Prisoner, and gave him 8 d. a Pound. We sell it again for 9 d. to the Founders.
Rawson. I gave 15 d. a Pound for it myself.
Another . I am Servant to Rawson, and was accidentally drinking with Jeddory, and he told me, and he told me, he had bought some new-cast Brass, which he believ'd was not honestly came by. I desired to see it, and I went to his Shop, and saw it, and knew it to be my Masters. I saw 54 lb. and he told me, he had several Hundreds of it, which he had bought in small Parcels. This Brass is my Master's, and he must give 15 d. a Pound for it, if he was to buy it himself.
Jeddory . I bought it with an Intent to catch the Thief: The Prisoner's Wife used to come with a little Bit now and then. I did not pay for the last Parcel, but went to look for the Thief, and thought I should find him out, by going among the Trade, and describing the Patterns. My Son bought the last Parcel, and told Mr. Rawson's Servant of it.

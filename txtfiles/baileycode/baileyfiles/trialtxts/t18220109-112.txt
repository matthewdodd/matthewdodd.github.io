            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Regent Circus, Piccadilly


. On the 8th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening I went out, leaving my son and daughter in the shop; returned in about twenty-five minutes, and asked my daughter where the boy was, she said a pair of boots were stolen. I ran across Waterloo-place, and saw a mob coming out of Market-street, a gentleman laid hold of the prisoner, saying he was the boy who took the boots.

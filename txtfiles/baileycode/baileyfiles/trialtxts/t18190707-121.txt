            . On the 5th of July, at night, I met the prisoner in Westminster, and went with her to a house in the Almonry


 - I gave her 4 s. I awoke about four o'clock in the morning, she was gone. I missed a 1 l. note out of my breeches-pocket - I was sober. I told the woman of the house. I went with the watchman, and found her at the Star and Crown, drunk - I am certain she is the woman. My note was safe when I went into the room.

            . On Sunday evening last, coming along Thames-street


 between five and seven, there were some people I thought coming rather in a hurry; I felt something at my right-hand pocket, I felt and missed a white handkerchief; I immediately turned round, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand; I took him by the collar, I think he was going to throw it to some of his companions; it fell into the road, it was taken up, and delivered to me; we secured the prisoner, and took him into a public-house, and he was carried before a magistrate, and committed.

            . I was with Mr. Bullock at the time I heard him say, Grice, my pocket is picked; he had hold of the boy at the bar; I saw the handkerchief lying close by the prisoner's feet; I took it up.
Prisoner's defence.
There were several people, some before and some behind me; the gentleman turned round and laid hold of me, and said I had taken his handkerchief; I know no more of it than any body in the world.

JOHN WHEELER
. On Sunday evening, the 28th of April, I was passing through Bishopsgate-street—I felt a tug, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner behind me, and passing a handkerchief to another person—I turned, and tried to take the other, but could not—I took the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house—I had seen it safe half an hour before—the one I saw him pass appeared like mine decidedly, and to the best of my belief it was mine—he begged me not to take him to the watch-house.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along—this gentleman laid hold of me, and said, "Did you see any body at my pocket?"—I said, "No." Witness. I did not ask him if he had seen any body at my pocket.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

             sworn. - I am a broker
, I live in Vine-street, Hatton-garden


: On the 24th of September, I was shutting the shop between six and seven o'clock, and when I came out with the last shutter, I saw a boy jump off the step with the time-piece in his hand; I ran after him, and in about an hundred yards I took the boy with the time-piece in his hand; he was trying to put it in his pocket; I took him, and brought him back, and gave him and the time-piece up to an officer.
Q. Did you know the boy before? - A.No, I never saw him before in my life; his mother came to our house about a fortnight after the boy was taken up; she said she lived in Long-lane, and she had not seen the boy for a month.

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden; I took the prisoner into custody; I asked him what he was going to do with the time-piece; he said he did not know what it was, but he should take it home to his mother, and he supposed his mother would send him back with it; I went back to Mr. Hodges, and saw the string broke where this time-piece hung. (The time-piece produced and identified by the prosecutor.)

                  Carter 
               



            , of Paddington


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing 3 Weather Sheep, value 39 s.
             the Property of 
               
                  
                     John

            , the 30th of September
 last. The Prosecutor depos'd, that the Sheep were Scotch Sheep, a Sort that scarce any-body in the Country had but himself; that the Sheep were lost out of his Ground, and upon Enquiry hearing that the Prisoner was in St. Giles's Roundhouse upon Suspicion of stealing Sheep, he went, and was inform'd where they were; and that going to the Place, he found one of them kill'd, and two alive. The Prisoner pleaded that he bought the Sheep; but could produce no Evidence to prove it; whereupon, the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

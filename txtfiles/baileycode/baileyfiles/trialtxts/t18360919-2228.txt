WILLIAM EDWARD SAWYER
. I am a newspaper-agent, and live at St. Mary, Newington. The prisoner was in my service—on the 5th of September I gave him 33s. to go and purchase some papers—he did not return—I found him lying in the passage of a house—I asked him what he had done with the money—he said he had lost it—I took him to his house, and asked him how he had got the new boots which he had on—he said he lost part of the money—I said he could not lose part without all—he then said he would tell me the truth, that he had bought the boots, he had been to the theatre, and to mother Rice's, and 5s. he was robbed of—I gave him 20 shillings, and 26 sixpences.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

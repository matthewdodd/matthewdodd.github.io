, the 9th of April
 last.
John Maxey. Going along Lime-street, I saw the Prisoner and another standing at Pewterer's Hall-Gate, and humming a Song, I look'd at 'em by the Light of a Lamp, and did not like 'em. As I pass'd 'em, one of them said, Shall us go? And the other answer'd, Yes. They follow'd me, and in Fenchurch-street


, one of 'em took hold of me, and clapp'd his Hand to my Mouth, and then the Prisoner snatch'd off my Hat and Wig, and went off; but presently return'd, and said to the other, whom I held fast, Damn you, why don't you come along? and he answer'd, That I would not let him. Then the Prisoner stabb'd me in the Hand, and knock'd me down. The Prisoner was afterwards sent to Newgate, on Suspicion of stealing another Hat, which he offer'd to sell to the very Man who had sold it before to the Person that lost it.
Prisoner. I am as innocent of the Fact as your Lordship is. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

               feloniously stealing a Holland Gown, a Pair of Sheets, and other Goods
            , on the 21st of November
 last, the Property of 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     Nichols 
                  




                
            .
The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoners lodg'd in the same House with himself, and that he went out on the 21st of November last, and look'd his Door, leaving the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, in the Room, but when he return'd, the Door was broke open, and the Goods mentioned in the Indictment taken away. That he suspected the Prisoners, and charg'd them with the Fact, and afterwards found the Goods at one Mr. Wolley's, a Pawnbroker, who inform'd him, That he had them of the Prisoner, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Meads 
               



            , who said they were his Sister's, who was in great Distress, and had Occasion to borrow some Money on them.
The Man said in his Defence, (like his First-Father, after he fell into Sin) that his Wife gave them to him, and he did pawn them. The Wife said in her Defence, That she found them upon the Stairs, and gave them to her Husband; but their Excuses being of no Effect, without Proof, the Jury found Thomas Meads 


               Guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d.
             but the Wife being under the Power and Direction of her Husband, the Jury 

               acquitted
             her.

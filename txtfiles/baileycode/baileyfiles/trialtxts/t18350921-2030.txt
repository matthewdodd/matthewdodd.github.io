HENRY WELLAND
, the younger, was indicted

 for feloniously forging, on the 
23rd of June, a request for the delivery of goods.—2nd COUNT, for uttering, &c.






JOSEPH TUCKER
. I live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. The prisoner came to our warehouse on the 23rd of June, to look at some cloth—I showed him several pieces—he selected one, and desired me to cut six yards, which I did—he then chose some waistcoating—I made the bill out—he said his father would pay for them—I said, "We do not trust any one"—I merely knew his father from being a tenant of mine; but I said as I knew his father, if he wanted a cut of cloth I most have an order for it—he went away, and brought this order in a short time, and I let him have it—(read) "Mr. Tucker, Please to let the bearer have the cloth, and waistcoat-piece, and I will call in a few days and pay you"—his father afterwards gave me the duplicate, and said he had sent him out of the country.





PHILIP WATSON
. I received the duplicate from my master, Mr. Tucker, and went and took this cloth out of pledge.





HENRY WELLAND
. I am the prisoner's father. This order is not my writing—I never gave it to my son, nor sent him for the cloth.

Prisoner's Defence. In June, I was sent to my uncle in the country, till this affair should be settled—I returned, and in a few days told me he had settled it—I do believe it is a conspiracy to send me away.





JOSEPH TUCKER
. His father told me he would send him out of the country; and he told me he was gone, and that in the pocket of this clothes he had found this duplicate.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

JAMES MYERS
. I am a prisoner. I was living at 64, Wentworth-street, on 2nd June—I had known Morgan about five weeks before that—when I became acquainted with him, I lived at 71, Lambeth-street—he was a fellow-lodger—I had been in the habit for three or four days of going to the docks with him—three or four days after I first knew him, I was coming from the docks with him, and he said he was tired of going to the docks, and he should try something else, and he knew where he could lay his hand on from 150l. to 200l.—I said I should like to have such a sum, provided I could get it honestly—he said he knew of a post-office and ladies' shoe-shop in Church-street, Hackney, which could be done, the master of which be knew to be generally absent on Sunday—he did not mention the name—he asked me to be a party, and I consented—this was about 21st or 22nd May—I went up and down Hackney several times looking for a post-office and shoe-shop, and at last found Mr. Hoggs', and communicated to him what Morgan had told me—I went with him to the station in Church-street, Hackney, and he communicated with the police. On 22nd May, the evening the carpet was taken, I saw Morgan at Roach's house in White Bear-court—I knew Roach before, but Morgan had said nothing before that evening of getting Roach into it—he told Roach he knew of a house at Hackney that could be done, and asked Roach to be a party with me, and that a considerable sum of money and plate was expected—he consented—it was then arranged that it was to be done on the following Sunday—we were to meet at Roach's, but it was not done then—I conversed with Morgan almost every day—he said he had only postponed it on account of his clothes being bad, that he should have no difficulty in getting in, but he was afraid the police would be suspicious when he came out of the house—on Sunday afternoon, the 2nd, he came to my lodging about five o'clock, and said he had made up his mind to have Roach, as he could not trust to me, he thought I should not do my part—he said, "Mind, I will speak plainly, if I see you do not do your duty when you get down there, I will stick a knife into you"—he said he would meet me at Roach's at half-past seven—I went—Roach was at home—Morgan came shortly afterwards—Roach gave me this iron bar—I asked him what it was for—(Morgan was not present then)—he said, "To use or break open, you can't tell what you may want it for"—we all left Roach's together about half-past eight to go to Hackney—going down the road, Morgan said, "I will go and knock at the door, you two must gradually work yourselves in while I am standing talking to the servant"—he said the servants were to be bound, and a handkerchief was to be placed over their mouths, while he went up-stairs to secure the cash-box, and if they were not quiet by being bound, they were to be quieted by other means—that was agreed on in Roach's presence—we went to Mr. Hoggs'—Morgan knocked at the door, it was opened, and he went in—Roach and I waited outside—Morgan came outside—I saw the female servant in the passage with a candle in her hand—we went in—Roach made a rush at her, and I heard her scream—several policemen rushed out of the rooms into the passage—Roach was seized, and a blow or two was struck at me, but sergeant Brennan recognised me and interfered—I gave him the crow-bar I had, and went down to the station with them, and next day to the police-court—I was not charged; I was examined as a witness, but not till the Wednesday—I was there, but was not brought up—I was in custody at

the Hackney Union, where I was advised to go for safety—I went there on the Monday night—a policeman took me there, but did not remain with me.

Roach. Q. Did you not state, on the first Sunday, that you had such a bad headach you could not go? A. Yes; I did not say on the second Sunday that it was through my hip being broken—I did not tell you I had a sister in Hackney, and if you went with me I could get 3s. or 4s. of her, and could have a spree; nothing of the kind passed—I did not hear you say you would not go, as you had lent your shoes—I did not say, "Get any pair, so that you come along with me"—the first time I informed Mr. Hogg was on Sunday morning, 12th May.





JAMES COWARD
 (police-inspector, N.)On Sunday, 12th May, Myers and Mr. Hogg came to the station in Church-street, Hackney—from what they told me, I and other officers went to Mr. Hogg's, but nothing took place—we went on four Sundays—I received farther information, and on Sunday afternoon, 2nd June, about a quarter-past five o'clock, I went to the house, with sergeant Brennan and sergeant Attwood, and posted Clark and another constable at the public-house opposite—I had arranged with Mr. Hogg that he should go out as usual—I placed sergeant Attwood in the coal-cellar, at the end of the passage immediately facing the front-door—I and Brennan went into a darkened room just inside the front-door—there was glass in the door, so that we could see into the passage—a light was placed on the stairs, which lighted the passage—the female servant was in the house—I had arranged with her and Mr. Hogg what was to be the plan of action—about twenty minutes to ten, a single knock came to the front-door—Elizabeth Chapman answered it, and I heard Morgan's voice—I did not see him, but I have heard his voice since—he asked if Mr. Hogg was at home—she said he was not—he asked how long she thought he would be—she said Mr. Hogg did not tell her when he went out or returned home—he asked if he might be allowed to sit down to wait—I heard him come in, and heard them go along the passage, as if down towards the kitchen—they remained about ten minutes, and then came up again—I heard Morgan say he could stop no longer—he said, "I can open the door"—I heard it open, looked out, and saw him go out, and pull it to by the knocker; but before he pulled it to, some persons rushed in—I had seen Elizabeth Chapman in the passage—I heard a fall, as if somebody had been violently knocked down—a female screamed, and said, "Don't hurt me"—I and Brennan rushed into the passage—I found Roach standing with his back towards me, as if having received a blow—I saw another man, and struck at him with a stick—Brennan said, "It is Myers; don't hit him"—I siezed Roach on one side, and Brennan on the other—we took him to the station—Myers accompanied us—Roach was searched in my presence, and these two cords, one with a running noose, found on him, and this knife—I returned to Mr. Hogg's, and found the servant in a fainting state, bleeding from the side of her nose.





ELIZA CHAPMAN
. I am servant to Mr. Hogg. On the Sunday evening I was in the kitchen, and heard a single knock—I opened the door, and saw Morgan—he went with me into the kitchen, and remained about ten minutes—he asked me twice when my master would be at home—I said I did not know—he said he had a long journey to take, that he was going, and he could open the door himself—he went up into the passage, and I followed him—he opened the door—I was standing with a light, a little way from the door—when the door was opened, Roach came in—I said, "What are you going to do?"—he caught hold of me round the neck with his left hand, violently, and punched me in the face two or three time with his fist, very hard

blows, on both sides of my face—I fainted away—I afterwards found my face bleeding a little at the side—the officers came into the passage, and I got into the kitchen.

Roach. Q. Where did the blood come from? A. From my face; there was a scratch at the side of my nose—I do not recollect Myers coming in—I do not know whether he struck me.
(The
COURT
considered that there was no case of burglary, the door being opened by Morgan by permission of the servant. See Reg. v. Johnson and Jones; and Car v. Marshman, 185.)

Morgan's Defence. I was going to ask relief, as I had once before; what business the others had there I know nothing about; I was going to acquaint a policeman of the affair, when I was taken.

Roach's Defence. Myers came and asked me to go and see his sister; I said I did not feel inclined; he said, "Do, for I can get 3s. or 4s. from her, and we can get some beer;" I went with him; the door was opened by a girl, and he pushed me violently against her, with his hand behind my neck, and, to save myself from falling, I was obliged to lay hold of the girl; the police came and took me; Myers has been convicted four times, twice for forgery, and goes about to entrap peaceable persons.

John Davis. On Wednesday the 24th of March, the Prisoner came into my Shop, and desired me to take Measure of her for a Pair of Shoes, which I did; then she desired she might wait a little in the Shop for a Girl she expected to come by; she sat half an Hour, and another Customer coming in, while I was fitting him, she took the Goods, I did not miss them till next Morning, and being a young Shop-keeper was surpriz'd at losing my Goods. I told my Neighbours of my Loss, and Mr. Pierce inform'd me he had seen a Pair of double-channell'd Pumps sold with the Name Wright in the Inside. I knew they were mine by that, for I made them for a Gentleman of that Name.
- Pierce. The Prisoner brought the Shoes and Pumps to me, and would have me buy them. She ask'd 3 s. 6 d. for the Pumps, and took 3 s.
The Prisoner said, she had the Goods of a Shoe-maker in Tooley-street, who would have appeared for her, had he been Living. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.

I am a lighterman, I was at Justice Key


, and saw the tarpaulin shake, and I saw a man give the prisoner some tobacco; he begged for God's sake that I would let him go; I took two pounds of tobacco from the prisoner; he said, I will never come any more, I will never do such a thing again; I took him into custody, I saw the hogshead full about two hours before.
Prisoner. Did not I shew you the man that gave me the tobacco? - I saw the man that gave him the tobacco; he received it from him, he made his escape from one of the other watchmen.

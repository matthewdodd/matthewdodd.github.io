Sarah More. On the 6th of June I had ordered the prisoner at the bar to fetch my box from the waggon with the things mentioned in the indictment in it; ( naming them,) I gave him a shilling for fetching them, and when I went to his house for them the box was broke open and the things mentioned were taken out.
Prisoner. She ordered me to bring the things to my own apartment.
S. More. I told him in case it was too late at night when he returned he might keep them at his house till morning.
Q. Did he bring them to your house?
S. More. He did not, so I went to his house the next morning, there I found my box uncorded and the lid broke open.
Q. Was it locked before?
S. More. It was, and I had the key in my pocket.
Q. Was the prisoner at home?
S. More. No, I saw a little girl first, then his wife came in.
Q. How was it broke?
S. More. The lock was not broke, but the hinges were.
Cross examination.
Q. How long after this was it that you took out a warrant against the prisoner?
S. More. It was about a month after.
Q. What was the reason you did not take it before?
S. More. I was ill and could not.
Q. Was it upon the account of your illness that you did not?
S. More. It really was.
Q. When did you take the prisoner up?
S. More. I took him up on the first of July, I waited for the waggoner coming up.
Q. Did you charge the prisoner with this fact at taking him up?
S. More. I did, and said if he would bring me my things that were missing nothing should come on it.
Q. Do you know Mr. Wade ?
S. More. I do, he is one of the prisoner's bondsmen, they came and offered me the money for the things after the bill was preferred.
Q. Who came with him?
S. More. Mr. Banister did.
Q. Was you with the prisoner before the justice?
S. More. I was.
Q. What was said there?
S. More. The prisoner said he would die before he would confess, and he would never pay me for them neither.

            . I am mother to the prosecutrix, I saw her put all the things into the box, and after that I corded it fast and safe and sent it by the carrier.
Q. Were the things she mentioned in the box ?

M. More. They were.
Q. From whence did you send them?
M. More. From out of Staffordshire: I had been not well and her master gave her leave to come down to see me.

                  Waley 
               



            . I am the person that drove the waggon, I delivered the box to the prisoner at the bar in the same condition as I received it in the country, it was fastened tight with a cord.
Prisoner's defence.
As I received it of the waggoner so I delivered it.
Q. to Waley. Are you sure you delivered it corded to the prisoner?
Waley. I am sure I delivered it locked and corded fast to him.
Prisoner. It was about nine at night when I received it, and she was in bed when I brought it, and would not come down, so I took it home.
For the prisoner.
Burk Wade. The young woman seemed inclinable to make it up; the justice said there is no evidence to convict the prisoner, and I believe I shall discharge him on the Wednesday, we went away, then I asked her how she could swear against the man, she said she would not swear for the world that he had her things.
Q. What concern had you in it?
Wade. I am a neighbour, and have known the prisoner between four and five years.
Q. What is he?
Wade. He is a labourer belonging to the water works at Chelsea
.
Q. What is his general character?
Wade. He has an exceeding good character, we thought him an honest man, and I am one of his bail.
Q. to prosecutrix. Was the box empty when you found it?
Prosecutor. No it was not, there were other things in it.
Q. Were there no more in value left, than there were missing?
Prosecutrix. There were.
Q. Were there more in weight left, than taken away ?
Prosecutrix. There were.
Q. Are you sure you locked the box ?
Prosecutrix. I did, before I came from my mother's house, and my mother corded it, and there was not a bit of cord upon it at the prisoner's house,
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Prosecutrix. I did, and thought him an honest man or I had not sent him for my box.
Q. What induced you to think he took them out?
Prosecutrix. The waggoner told me he delivered the box out of the waggon to him safe.
Q. Did you search the prisoner's house?
Prosecutrix. No I did not, they told me I could not take a search warrant out for them.
Q. Describe the condition the box was in when you first saw it at the prisoner's.
Prosecutrix. It was broke in several places on the top and sides, I have not had it mended, it is in the same condition now.
Q. to Waley. How long was the waggon coming to London?
Waley. It was five days.
Q. Was the box in the waggon all the time?
Waley. It was.
Q. Could any body come at it in the waggon?
Waley. No they could not without removing other things.
Q. Can you swear that at the time it was delivered to the prisoner, that the hinges and lock were as safe as when delivered to you?
Waley. It was all the very same, locked and corded fast and the things safe.
Q. Are you sure of it?
Waley. I am quite sure, I delivered it to him with my own hands.
Q. How long after you received the box of the prosecutrix's mother before you put it into the waggon?
Waley. I put it in directly as I received it.
Q. Did it stay in the yard any time?
Waley. No it did not.
Q. How long did the waggon stay at London before you took the box out?
Waley. I believe the waggon stood in the inn-yard with it in about two hours; the waggon was not unloaded till the next morning, there was only the box taken out, which I delivered to the prisoner with my own hands.

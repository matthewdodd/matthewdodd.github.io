             sworn.
I live near Carnaby-market; I went to Hammersmith; I was in Hyde-park


; there was a review: somebody picked my pocket of a truss; about four hours afterwards it was brought to my house by these two men.

             sworn.
About four o'clock in the afternoon I saw this lad and another picking pockets; when he was in the watch-house he endeavoured to slide the truss away.

             sworn.
I am a publican; Sanders and I took this man (corroborates the testimony of the last witness); Sanders has kept the truss ever since.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was in Hyde-park, and stooping down by an arch to ease myself, I saw a paper lying with a truss in it, and I picked it up and opened it; I cannot read, but I saw writing upon it, and clapt it into my pocket: I was tried at Hicks's-hall to-day, and am to be transported seven years for that; and I am as innocent of that as I am of this.




               GUILTY, 10 d
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

            . I am a perriwig-maker; on the first of November I lost four perriwigs out of my shop, belonging to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Burdet

                  Bickham 
               



            ; I have found Burdet's and Hannoway's again, one in Elmose's possession, the other in one Gordon's possession; I know nothing against the prisoners.
John Hall. I was one concerned with the prisoners; Briant went into the prosecutor's shop, I held the door, and Plastow stood at the door, but 
               
                  Ann 
                  Rowley 
               



             was not there; Briant took four perriwigs in his pocket, we carried them to Rag-fair; but I was taken up and carried to Gaol, and do not know how they disposed of them.
Bryant's Defence
I met this Hall in Rag-fair, he desired me to go and take a walk with him, saying he knew where to get some things; but I would not go with him.
All three 

               acquitted

            . On the 12th of May, between eight and nine in the evening, I was going down Snow-hill


; at the bottom of the hill I heard somebody call, You Sir, in the whitish coat! I stopped; a man came to me, and said, your pocket is picked; he said, turn back, the pickpocket is in custody, and the handkerchief is upon him; I turned back, and saw the prisoner in the hands of Mr. Holmes, and my handkerchief; the prisoner begged I would forgive him; (the handkerchief produced and deposed to.)
Jasper Holmes. On the 12th of May, about nine in the evening, I was coming from the King's Arms, at Holbourn-bridge; I saw the prisoner draw this handkerchief out of the prosecutor's right-hand pocket; I was crossing the way, not above four yards from him; I laid hold of his hand with the handkerchief in it, and called to the young man; he came and owned it.
Prisoner's defence.
Coming down Snow-hill, there were two or three other people walking by the gentleman; the handkerchief came flump against my apron, and I picked it up, and that man got hold of me, and said he saw me take it out of the gentleman's pocket.

The Prisoner pleaded, that as he was going along, the Sugar was thrown out of a Window, and like to have fallen upon him, and knock'd him o'th Head, and so he took it up. But this Plea neither being prov'd, nor appearing probable, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d
            .

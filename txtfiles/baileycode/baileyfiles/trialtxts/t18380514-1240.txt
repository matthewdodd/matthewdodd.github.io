ELIZABETH RUSHWORTH
. I am the wife of James Rushworth, a milkman, who lives in Upper Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 14th of April, I was in the parlour at the back of our shop—I heard a noise, like the sound of my till being taken—I looked through the window, and saw a boy, with the till in his arms, and he went down the street—I went out as fast as I could, and cried, "Stop thief"—he dropped the till, and I took it up, and brought it in—there were three shillings in it, some sixpences, and some pence and halfpence—there was 5s. 11d. in copper altogether—the prisoner was brought back by John Turnbull—I had not seen the boy so as to know who he was, when he went out of the shop.





JOHN TURNBULL
. I live with Mr. Pitman, a green-grocer, in Charlton-street. I was at the door of a house, No. 14, Charlton-street, on the opposite side to the prosecutor's—I heard Rushworth crying, "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running, with a till in his hand—as he came to where I was, he dropped the till—I pursued, and took him—he did not run above six or eight doors—I am quite certain it was the prisoner dropped the till.


Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and then this lad took me.

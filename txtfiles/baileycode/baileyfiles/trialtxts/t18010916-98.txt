Q. In what condition were they when you saw them over night? - A. Very clean and in good condition; when I saw them at Newington they were in a very dirty condition, and had lain very dirty in the stable; I am sure they were the same pigs; Mr. Saunders is a Quaker.
- SNOW sworn. - I am a constable of Newington, Surry: On the 12th of June, in the morning, I received information that there were some pigs in a stable near the Waggon and Horses, in the Newington road, in consequence of which I went to the stable, situate between the two roads, one leading to Newington and the other to Walworth; the stable belonging to a man of the name of Marsh; when I came to the stable, the door was locked, and a sack nailed up to make it dark; I pulled that down and went in; I made enquiry, and learnt that the man who had lodged the pigs there was at the Waggon and Horses; he had a horse and cart there also; I went to the Waggon and Horses, where the man was pointed out to me.
Q. Who did that man turn out to be? - A.John Smith, alias Henry Stiles; he had the key of the stable in his hand, and oats and beans in a handkerchief by the side of him, for the horse; I took him into custody and locked him up, I took the key from him and went to the stable, where I found the horse and nine pigs, and this pistol in the window loaded. (Produces a large horse pistol).
Q. Did you afterwards shew those same pigs to Mr. Wickins and Mr. Saunders? - A. Yes, and they claimed them; I took him to Union Hall, and he was committed; I then went to search his lodgings, and I found these two smock-frocks, in the same situation in which they are now, these two knives, and a steel.

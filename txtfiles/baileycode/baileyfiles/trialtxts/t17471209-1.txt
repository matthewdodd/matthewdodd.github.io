            . I lost a fortnight ago all those things mentioned in the indictment.
Q. Have you found the things again?
Duke. Yes.
Q. Where did you find them?
Duke I found the hatch and other things by her direction at one Mr Perry's; and the tea-spoon I found was melted down. I bought the pestle and mortar, she had sold: I found them all by her direction. The prisoner was not a servant, but I took her to give her a piece of bread.
Q. to Prisoner. What have you to say? will you ask her any questions?
Prisoner. No.

            . I am a watchman : I found the hatch at Mr. Perry's; she said, she sold it for 1 s. I went there and found it. It was not concerned about the other things.
Q. to Prisoner. What do you say for yourself?
Prisoner. I was at Mrs. Duke's and did work for her: I went out on an errand, and I met a young woman with the hatch in her hand, and she desired me to carry it for her, and I helped the other girl to carry it to the gentleman, and he gave her 6 d. and she gave it me; and she was to go to Mr. Perry for the other 6 d.

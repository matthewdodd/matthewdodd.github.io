JOHN PURVIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of February, 1 jacket, value 10s., the goods of 



Richard Tong, being in a boat on the navigable 
river Thames.







RICHARD TONG
. I am a boatswain's mate on board the Dreadnought hospital ship. The prisoner was a patient there—on the 27th of February he assisted in rowing a boat to the Tower—I was in the boat, with Robinson—I went on shore, leaving the prisoner in the boat, and my jacket, which had belonged to the institution, but I was chargeable for it—when I returned to the boat, the prisoner was gone, and my jacket—I have never seen it since.

Prisoner. Q. Was this missing the first or second time I was left in the boat? A. That I cannot say—I know the jacket, it came down just below my knees—there were three jackets and a great-coat—you had no jacket on when you left the ship.





GEORGE ROBINSON
. I had come in the boat with the prosecutor, and was left in the boat with the prisoner—Tong's sea-jacket wat in the boat—the prisoner put it on, and went on shore—I did not say any thing, as I thought he was coming back; but he did not.

Prisoner. I had been left in charge of the boat three quarters of an hour before, and, had I an inclination to steal, I could have taken them all—when I left the boat last, I had no jacket at all—I could bring two witnesses to prove this man is a convicted felon—I went on shore to see

for my prize money, and when I came hack, the boat was gone. Witness. I never was in prison in my life, and never was convicted.





RICHARD TONG
. I arrived at the Tower about one o'clock, and did not leave till three, as I had been round about Tower-hill to look for the prisoner, but could not find him—one of the persons who went out on Monday saw him, and gave him in charge.

Transported for Seven Years.

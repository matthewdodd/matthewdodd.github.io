HORATIO HASLEHAM
. I live in Jerusalem-passage, and am a broker. On the 23rd of January I missed a writing-desk—I did not see it taken, I was told of it—I went out about one hundred yards, and saw the prisoner carrying it—I took him—it had been standing on a music stool, inside the shop—I have seen him three or four times lurking about my shop.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

                  Thomas 
                  Flight 
               



            . On the 20th of April I came home, and was inform'd I had lost a large quantity of iron, and that Trow was stopp'd in Noble-street with it on his back, and he was had to a publick house, near mine. I went to him, there was Mr. Goodwin with him, he told me he stopp'd him in Noble-street; the iron was at his house. (Produced in court and deposed to.) I believe I lost much more than I have found. I have got about three or four hundred weight again, the prisoner confessed he had taken it, and seemed to be very sorry, and said he was persuaded to it. I had employed him in pulling down these houses where he had the iron, and had discharg'd him but the day before. He said also there were two other persons concerned with him: in consequence of this he was carried to the Compter. We tried to take 
               
                  William 
                  Stansley 
               



            , the man who, as he said, persuaded him to do it: the other he could not think of his name then; but could not take Stansley. We took Trow before my Lord-Mayor, where he did not deny it; he said there were two others concerned with him, and he'd endeavour to find them out by his direction. We went and took 
               
                  John 
                  Price 
               



             the other prisoner. After carrying him to the Compter we found out his house with a great deal of difficulty, We asked his wife leave to go down into the cellar, to which she consented, and the constable went down stairs with a candle, there we found two bags of iron, which Trow had said they had taken away that morning, that is Stansley and Price. There was also a great many other things, which I knew to be my property, though I have not laid them in the indictment. Then we went to my Lord-Mayor and told him what we had found; he desired me to get Price before him to be examin'd. When he came there he told my Lord that Stansley and Trow had that morning call'd him up, I think a little after four o'clock; that they three went to this place of mine, and that he went with a great deal of reluctance. When they came to the door he believed either Trow or Stansley broke it open, he thought it was Trow, and he himself was on the other side of the way; and that the other two went up stairs, and brought down three bags; and that he took one and Stansley the other; that they both persuaded him to let them be at his house till after breakfast time, and promised they'd fetch them away; that they brought them, but as they came not for them, he threw them down into the cellar.
Q. Did you promise him he should have favour, or threaten him if he would not confess?
Flight. No, I did neither.


                  John 
                  Goodwin 
               



            . I live in Noble-street, Foster-lane ; about a quarter after four in the morning, on Good-Friday, I saw Trow, with iron on his back, as I was opening my shop, as he came to my door: he throw'd the iron down under my window, he said will you buy this stuff, he was drunk; I said if you'll let it stay till about ten o'clock, i'll get you a chap, he said I and two more have been at work all night, for a little fuddle; he brought it into my shop, and desired to leave it till six o'clock, and he'd call for it, then he called in about half an hour, and said he was very dry and sleepy, whereupon I directed him to an alehouse, and he sat in a box, and fell a sleep; I awak'd him in about an hour, and said come, here is a man will buy this iron; I had told a neighbour one Mr. Woaten the affair, and that I thought he had stole it; Mr. Wooten took and looked at it, and said I don't like it, where did you get it, who is your master, he gave but-little answer, he was going to take it away; we stopped him, and told him he did not come honestly by it; I took him back to the publick-house, he told us where he stole it; so we found out where the prosecutor liv'd; he said, he, Stansley, and another man had been at work all night, in order to make a fuddle of it as he call'd it; he said he took it out of Mr. Flight's board in Pater-Noster-Row; I was present with him before my Lord-Mayor; he acknowledged taking the iron mentioned there, I know nothing of Price.
Q. Did you or any others make use of any promises or threats, in order for this confession?
Goodwin. I said had not you better make your self an evidence, but I promised nothing, that was not in my power.

            . I am constable, Mr. Flight sent for me on Good-Friday in the morning, there was Mr. Goodwin, and Trow with him, we took him before my Lord-Mayor, there he confessed. He went on and confirmed the other two witnesses.
Trow's Defence.
I went to buy some old boards of Mr. Flight's apprentice, seeing this old iron lie there, I took it to carry it to his house; I left it at Price's house till breakfast time, Stansley was with me, he went to buy some boards; I went to get half a pint of beer, I lost Price's house, so I got to Mr. Goodwin's house, and there slung it down, and waited to get some beer, and fell asleep.
To his Character.

            . When Trow was taken up he confessed amongst others, that Gardner had robbed me of some deal boards, I know nothing of my own knowledge; when I took up Gardner, he confessed to me he had stole boards twice, I went to Mr. Cox a baker, where they said they had sold some, I saw there some boards which I took to be mine; I always look'd upon Gardner to be an honest lad, and if he has been guilty he was drawn into it by Trow.


                  Thomas 
                  Carpenter 
               



            . The two prisoners and I was at work at some old houses, for Mr. Flight, in Pater-Noster-Row ; we heard Mr. Cox a baker in Warwick-lane wanted some old boards, Trow and I looked out four or five of them, I went up stairs, and they carried them; when Trow came back he brought 4 s. I had sixteen-pence, Gardner had a shilling, and Trow the remainder, 
               
                  John 
                  Trow 
               



             proposed this thing, Gardner always behav'd very honest before.



                  Samuel 
                  Wiseham 
               



            . I am constable; when I had taken Trow to the Compter, he told me Gardner was concerned, I went and found him he cried much, I have known him three or four years, he had a very good character, I verily believe he was drawn in.

                  Cox 
               



            . I bought the boards of Trow, they brought me three at first said my master gives his service, and says you may have as many as you please; then I said being me three or four more, and word what your master is to have; he brought word, I paid him; I don't know Gardner, Mr. Flight has seen them in my cellar, he said he believed they were his, I told him how I came by them.
For Gardner.

                  Matthews 
               



            . I lent Gardner to Mr. Flight, he has been apprentice with me three years, he has been in trust for me three years; he always behaved as honest as any person in England; I could trust him with the key of untold gold; I believe he is heartily concerned for what he has now done.


                  John 
                  Fowke 
               



            . I have known Gardner ever since he came apprentice, which is a little above three years ; I don't believe he'd take any of a bag of guineas, were they to be thrown down before him, he must be certainly drawn in by this bad man.

            . I only charge them on the confession of Trow ; when Ellibore was taken up he confessed he had received only part of 6 s. 6 d. his equal share, for old boards that were sold by Trow, Carpenter, Gardner, and himself, to William Stansley, taken from Pater-Noster-Row: Stansley is not yet taken, I believe Ellibore is drawn in by this Trow, he has worked for me a year; I believe him to have been an honest man till this affair.

                  Stansley 
               



             to the building in Pater-Naster-Row; he said he wanted old boards and old joyce, accordingly he had some delivered by three, Trow, Ellibore, and I; we received 2 s. 6 d. for them it was divided between us three, each an equal share. They were Mr. Flight's pieces of wood, we let him have them on Trow's persuasion; he was Trow's acquaintance; I never saw Stansley before in my life till he came there.
For Ellibore.

            . Ellibore served me 5 years, he is still my apprentice
 ; he is a very honest lad, I would trust him with all in my house, and would set him to work, and trust him with all I have, was he out.

I am a Peruke-maker, I have known him likewise between 4 and 5 years, he is a very honest sober young fellow, he has lodged in my house since he has worked in this last place; he has had a key to go in and out, and might have ruined me was it his pleasure. Was he now out I would trust him with my key as usual.

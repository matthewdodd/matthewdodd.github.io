                  SHARKE
               



            . On the 29th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Crown-street, Finsbury-square


; I saw a small crowd on the opposite side of the way; I crossed the way to see what was the matter, when the prisoner rushed against me and caught hold of my seal. I instantly catched hold of him; he fell down. I still kepthold, and with assistance took him to Worship-street office.
JACOB LEWIS. I am a carpenter; I live in Crown-street. I saw a mob; a woman had lost her shoe. I heard a person say he has stolen my watch. I saw the prisoner; the prosecutor had caught hold of him. The prisoner said he had not got his property. I called for a light; I dragged the prisoner two feet with intention of taking him into the Flying Horse public-house. I was looking to see if the property was on the ground; I heard something fall. I saw the two seals in question taken up and delivered to the prosecutor. I am sure the prisoner is the same man.
Prosecutor. These are the seals; the chain broke; the watch remained in my pocket. The prisoner never got away from me.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge that is against me.

            , aged 22.

ISAAC ALDERBERT
. On the 24th of March, I was between the church and Temple-bar, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening—I felt my pocket picked—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, which he was rolling up—I took it from him, and watched him till I saw an officer, when I gave him in charge.





JOHN BUDDER
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going on an errand—I kicked the handkerchief with my foot, and then took it up—this gentleman came and took it out of my hand—that was full a quarter of an hour before he gave me into custody.





ISAAC ALDERBERT
. I saw him rolling it up in his hand—I should have taken him at the time I took the handkerchief, but there were three or four persons round him—one of them told me to keep off—there were two other handkerchiefs found on the prisoner—one he said was his own, and the other was his wife's.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

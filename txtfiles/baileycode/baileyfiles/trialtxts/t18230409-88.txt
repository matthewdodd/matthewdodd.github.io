            . I am a taylor
 and live in White's-row, Spitalfields


; I saw this coat taken from over my door. I ran out and found the prisoner about a hundred yards off, with it under his arm. I called Stop thief! he looked round, I saw his face; he turned the corner, dropped it, and was secured. I am certain of him. I have see him before.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard an alarm and run to the bottom of the street, the prosecutor got hold of another man, and said
"I have got you, you rascal;" the man said it was me; and so he took me.

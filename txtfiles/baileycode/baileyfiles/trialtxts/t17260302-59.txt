Hester Shaw thus depos'd. On Monday Night last, betwixt 7 and 8, as I was coming over London-Bridge, there was a stop of Coaches, and a great Crowd. The Prisoner jostled against me several Times, and kept very close to me. I went to see the Wax Work last Southwark Fair


, and there a Friend of mine shew'd me this Bird along with 
               
                  Betty 
                  Wells 
               



            , and told me what a sort of Fellow he was. I remembered him again, and clapt my Hand upon my Pocket for fear it should be cut, but was cautious to late, for my Pocket was cut and my Money gone, Birds Hand was then at my side, and Newmarsh stood close too him: I cry'd out, but they slipt between the Coaches and got away. I had heard that the most likely Place to find 'em at, was a scandalous House, a Harbour for Rogues in Bird-Cage-Alley, in the Mint, 'tis the Bell and 7 Stars, or the Bell and Garter, I forgot which, but 'tis kept by - Fitzgerald, and Irishman. I took Assistance, went thither and found 'em both, the same Night. 


               Guilty 10 d. 
             each.

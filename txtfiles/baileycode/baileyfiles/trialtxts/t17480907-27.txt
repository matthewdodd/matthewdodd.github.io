                  Shuttlewood 
               



             . I lost three shirts out of my garden at Bethnal-green


.
Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar?
Shuttlewood . No; neither of them.
Q. What reason have you to accuse the prisoners ?
Shuttlewood . About three days afterwards there were several persons taken up, and put into Whitechapel watch-house; I sent my wife and maid to see whether they could hear any thing of the shirts, they being the best judges of the linnen; and they found them, and were both positive they were my shirts that were taken from Bethnal-green. And there was a boy, one Sheppard, who owned he took them off the line; and said they sold them, and that they divided the money between them.
Martifaa (the Constable). I had a search-warrant, and found about 140 handkerchiefs, and these 3 shirts.
Q. to Mrs. Shuttlewood. Are these shirts your husband's?


                  Sarah 
                  Shuttlewood 
               



             . Yes; they were lost on the 3d of August, between 2 o'clock and 8, and I miss'd them at 8.
Q. Are you sure these are your husband's shirts?
Shuttlewood . Yes; I am sure of it.
Q. to Martisaa . Where did you find them?
Martisaa . I found them at one Cooper's, a barber, in Petticoat-lane; his wife takes in pawns; and I took Sheppard on the Tuesday : and Sheppard said he stole them, and gave them to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Thompson 
               



            ; and that Thompson gave them to Linton.


                  William 
                  Sheppard 
               



            . And please you, my Lord, the 2 prisoners at the bar, and myself, were taking a walk round Bethnal-green one Friday evening.
Q. Can you recollect the day of the month?
Sheppard. I can't tell the day of the month.
Q. What was you going there for?
Sheppard. To take a walk ; and seeing these 3 shirts, I went into the yard, and took them off the line, and gave them to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Thompson 
               



            , and he gave them to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Linton 
               



            , and we all three went and sold them to 
               
                  William 
                  Rawlins 
               



             in Stoney-lane in Petticoat-lane; and he stood at the yard-door ready to receive them.
Q. Was it dark, or light?
Sheppard . It was about 7 o'clock.
Q. Where is this Rawlins?
Sheppard . He is not taken.
Thompson, to Sheppard . Did you give the shirts to me?
Sheppard . Yes, I did.
Thompson. 'Tis as false as God is true.
Linton to Sheppard. Did you see Thompson deliver the shirts to me?
Sheppard . Yes, I did.

            . My husband's watch was taken out of our house, on the evening of the 5th of August; it was on the mantle piece in the shop. The prisoner came in, and took it; I never saw him before; I never saw him afterwards, until he was taken last Saturday; I heard his own confession, that he took it; it was a very old watch. He said he did not know what became of it.

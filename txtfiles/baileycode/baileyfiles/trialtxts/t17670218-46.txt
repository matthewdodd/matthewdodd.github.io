            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Barbican


; my wife is a milliner; we carry on our business in the same house; she missed cardinal on the 29 th of January, I was not at home at the time; after it was taken, one 
               
                  John 
                  Clark 
               



             came the very night and asked me if I had no lost such a thing. I went with him to Clerkenwell, there we searched a room where was two girls; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Parsons 
               



             the evidence was one of them, we found a bundle; I untied it, and in it found the cardinal; we asked Parsons where she had it; she said she did not know any thing about it; at last she said one 
               
                  William 
                  Skeele 
               



             brought it there; that his partner, 
               
                  William 
                  Martin 
               



             and he, set it at 4 s. and she gave 2 s. for it; I went home and fetched the young woman that made the croak. she said it was my property; after that we took the prisoner, the other ran down stairs, but was stopt and brought back; the prisoner said he found the cardinal in Barbican, or something like it; we took them both to Bridewell that night, and before the Justice the next day, there they both said they found it.


                  Mary 
                  Baldwin 
               



            . This cardinal (holding one in her hand) is Mr. James's property, I made it; I was setting in the parlour with Mrs. James, at the time a pane of glass was broke in the shop window, on the 29th of January; we went out to see what was the matter, but could see nobody; then we went to see if any thing was lost, and missed nothing; but the next morning the uncle to one of the boys came, he asked if we had lost any thing; we said no; then he asked if we had lost a black silk cardinal; then we looked and missed it; then he said to Mr. James, if you will promise to prosecute, I can help you to it; he said, he had just saved his kinsman from being concerned with the other two; Mr. James went with him, and he came back about twelve, and said, I must go and look at a cloak that they had found, and see if I kn ew it. I went with him to Red-bull-yard, St. John's-street, there were two girls that they kept; one of them is called Martin's wife; I saw the cardinal, and proved it to be Mr. James's property: while we were talking about it, we heard somebody coming up stairs; Mr. Clark said they are coming, put the door too; they came up, the prisoner was first apprehended; Martin ran down stairs, but was soon apprehended and brought up: they were taken before Justice Girdler, he admitted the girl an evidence.

            : they brought a black silk cardinal in one night, tied up in a red handkerchief, and said they found it; Martin gave Skeele 2 s for his part, and gave the cardinal to me.

            . I have a building in Edward-street, Sander's-gardens


; it was uninhabited: I went there on the 1st of January, and found the leaden gutter had been ripped and rolled up; there was about 1 cwt. of lead removed, which had before been fixed - I got a person to watch: 
               
                  William 
                  Henry Roskell
               



             is my partner.

            . I am a patrol. I was desired to watch this building; I went there at half-past eight o'clockat night on the 1st of January - I did not see anybody there, but I heard a noise - I removed the lower shutters, and got into the lower room, where I caught the prisoner; I got him up, sprung my rattle, and Smith, the night - officer, came.

            . I was sent for to watch this house; I heard the rattle, and went and assisted in taking the prisoner - I received this lead from the watchman, but I did not fit it, because it had not been taken out of the gutter; about I cwt. had been entirely taken away.

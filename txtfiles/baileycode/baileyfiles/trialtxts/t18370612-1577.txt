1577. 




WILLIAM ENGLAND
 and 



THOMAS WAY
 were again indicted for

 feloniously breaking and entering a building within the curtilage of the dwelling-house of 



Robert Martin, on the 
6th of June, with intent to steal, and stealing there in 1 spoke-shave, value 6d., his goods, and 1 waistcoat, value 6d., the goods of 



Charles Maddock.






MR. ROBERT MARTIN
. On the 6th of June, I found my tool-house broken open, and missed a spoke-shave and other property, and a waistcoat belonging to Charles Maddock—the house had been closed—the door was shut, and left on the latch—it is always shut at night, but I cannot swear it was shut that night.





THOMAS HOBBS KING
 (police-constable N 248.) I found this jacket on Way's back, at the station-house, and the spoke-shave in the room in Duddy's-rents—Way said he had bought the jacket three months ago, in Petticoat-lane.

(Property produced and sworn to.)





CHARLES MADDOCK
. I am a carpenter, and work for Mr. Martin. This jacket is mine—there is paint and grease on it, and I have worn it two years—I wore it on the 5th of June, and missed it on the 6th.

Way. I have had it five years—I bought it in Petticoat-lane for 18d.

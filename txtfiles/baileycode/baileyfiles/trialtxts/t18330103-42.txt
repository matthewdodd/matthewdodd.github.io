, in Dorset-street


. We lost this property from the safe in the area; I saw it safe on the 22nd of December, at half-past nine o'clock - I then locked the safe, and at six the next morning I missed the property; this is the flour-tub, which I can swear to - there is no area door; they got over the railings.

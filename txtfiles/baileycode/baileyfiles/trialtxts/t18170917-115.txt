            . On the 3d of August, about a quarter before ten o'clock at night, I was walking up Church-lane


, Goodman's-stile, with my sister; three men met us-two passed on the wall-side, and the other, who was the prisoner, stopped me, by putting his hand against my bosom, which shoved me down. He said, I had a fine shawl on, and tore it from off my shoulder very violently; he tore off part of my gown with it. He went up the middle of the road; I ran after him, and saw it in his hand, he had got it entangled in his feet. I gave the alarm; he was stopped before I lost sight of him. I saw him throw the shawl down.

            . I came by the place, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I pursued, and secured the prisoner as he ran across the street.

            . I was with my sister. Three men met us-the prisoner pushed against us; I am certain he is the man. I saw him throw the shawl away, and picked it up.

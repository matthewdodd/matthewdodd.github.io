Attorney-General. The Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted for a Crime pretty much of the same Nature of that which you tried but just now, but indicted upon another Act of Parliament, which has not made the Punishment so great; by that Act of Parliament which was in the 9th of his present Majesty, it is provided, That if any Persons to the Number of three or more, assemble with Fire-Arms, in order to be aiding and assisting in the running and landing uncustomed Goods, and Goods liable to pay Duties, upon a Conviction for that Offence they are to be judged guilty of Felony, and to be transported for seven Years.
Gentlemen, the Prisoner at the Bar is indicted for his being guilty of the Crime mentioned in this Act of Parliament, which is, for his being assembled and armed with these Persons, or upwards, in the manner therein mentioned, in order to be aiding and assisting in running uncustomed Goods. Gentlemen, the Prisoner is one of those Persons we shall prove to you by the Testimony of two Witnesses, both of them who were present at that time, who were aiding and assisting at the same time; if he is found guilty, the consequence of which will be, that he will be transported for seven Years.

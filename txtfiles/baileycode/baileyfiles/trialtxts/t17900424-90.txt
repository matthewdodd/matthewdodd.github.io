            . My husband let the prisoner a lodging: him and his wife went away the 27th of February; they did not pay me for the lodging; I missed the things in the indictment; the man and his wife told me before they went, that they liked to lay in blankets, and had put the sheets under the bolster; I did not enquire any farther till after they were gone: I saw my sheets at the justices; the pawn-broker is here; the other things were in the drawers in the room; the drawers were not locked; I saw them all before the justice.

Court to Witness. Do you recollect whether that is a copy of the note he shewed you? - He read over a note to me for money, that he owed for board and lodging, and money borrowed; that was all that he read over to me; he asked me if I did know any thing of the difference of the the hand writing, which was his name, and

            's name; I believe he read such a note over to me, as it is there in record, in regard to board and lodging, and the money borrowed out of Mrs. Newton's pocket; no other article was mentioned to me; but he doubled the note, and got me to make a notch against the name.
Can you read? - No.
Do you recollect any thing being mentioned of goods being pledged? - There was no such a thing.


                  PETER
                   WATKINS
               



             sworn.
I am a cordwainer. Mr. Newton called on me, and asked me to go with him, when the prisoner was taken up by Old Tyburn; he confessed he pawned the things; and we found them at the pawnbroker's, Mr. Mangeter's.
Mrs. Newton deposes to the gown and piece of cotton. I know it by the old fashioned make; I had it made last year; and I had it made that old fashioned way, because I thought it suited me best; the piece of cotton is the same as the gown; it was in the drawer.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
The petticoat was pledged pretty near four months before I left the lodging, by the consent of that gentlewoman; I asked her for some cash? she told me she had none; the next was the sheets, nigh three months before I left the lodging; and according to agreement, I was to have clean sheets every month; she told me she had no cash to lend me; she said I might take the sheets if I pleased; my wife was continually pledging her things, backwards and forwards; and that same gown once before; the last thing that was pledged, was near two months before I left the lodging; when I asked for my bill, I thought it was very large; we made it up to the 13th of March; we put in the interest; I said, look over the bill, and see if it is right? says she, I never kept any account; oh, says I, I will make affidavit I kept a just account; to the best of my knowledge, she looked on the bill, and said she was very well satisfied; and she signed it: the magistrates said they could not make it felony; they said,you have signed your husband's property away: every word as I shall answer before your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, before heaven; and they gave me that copy; Mr. Green kept the bill which he has; I thought that if a person was indebted to a creditor, that they should have the bill by them; but I am deprived of it; it is the first Court that ever I was before in my life.
Court to Mrs. Newton. He says this petticoat was pledged by your consent, and the sheets and the cloak; is that true, or is it not? - It is not true.
Did you ever give him leave to pledge any of these things which were pledged, which were missing? - No, I did not.
Is all that false which he says? - That, Sir, is very false.
At the time he was a lodger to you, did you ever desire him to pawn any thing for you? - What I begged his wife to do, I always had the paper and the bill; but as to these articles, I never saw any; those things she carried for me, I have got again; I have taken them out myself.
Then you are very sure that none of these things that are missing, were at your request pawned by him? - None of them: we were settling money that I lent him; he was to pay me sixteen shillings a week for his and his wife's board; I did put my hand to that, for the debt he owed me, and for nothing else but the debt; this has been added afterwards.
Was there any thing in that account about pledges? - Not to my knowledge.
Prisoner. I have one favour to beg (she says she knows nothing of the things lent to pledge) which is, to ask her what the whole debt is.
Court to Mrs. Newton. Can you tell me what was the whole amount of the debt? - Upon my word I cannot; for I thought of receiving the money; he pretended he had a one hundred pounds draft in his pocket; and that he was put off from time to time receiving it.
And was that the reason that you settled the account in this way? - Yes.

                   Bowman
               



            . Do you remember what was the sum he read over to you? - I cannot recollect the sum; but he said it was eight pounds something odd.
Mangeter. I saw the note at Mr. Green's; and there was goods lent to pledge in the note; it was the same writing, and just like all the rest.
(This witness produced some duplicates.)
Mrs. Newton. These are the duplicates that I found in a tea-pot when they were gone.

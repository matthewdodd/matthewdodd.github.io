            . I am in partner

ship with Thomas Russell - we live in Chiswell-street


. On the 2nd of April we lost a piece of cheese; I did not see it taken, but a young man told me of it - I had seen it not above a minute before, on a board within the sash, which was open.

            . I was passing on the 2nd of April, and saw the prisoner take the cheese from the shop; he put his hand over the board - it was six or eight inches within the shop; I pursued, and took him in Type-street- there was another with him; the prisoner dropped the cheese as I collared him, and Mr. Holmes took it up.

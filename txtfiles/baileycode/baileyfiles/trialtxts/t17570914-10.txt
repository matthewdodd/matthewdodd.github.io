                  Nicholas 
                  Coine 
               



            . I lodge upon Tower-Hill


, at the house of 
               
                  James 
                  Pratt 
               



            . I lost to the amount of sixteen guineas, on the 18th of July last, it was in a box not lock'd, but the door of my room was lock'd, which I found broke open.
Q. What are you?
Coine. I am a porter
.
Q. What pieces of coin?
Coine. Both English and Foreign. A two guinea piece, and Portugal money, I can't justly say what; it was in a closet in a box, 29 l. all but 4 s. they did not take it all, I only know by what remain'd, what they took, but can't mention the pieces missing. 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lee 
               



             was at work in the house where I live, and the other prisoner turn'd the wheel for him, in polishing something in the gunsmith way. I suspected them. I got a warrant for them, and took up Lee the next day. I found upon him 1 l. 18 s. 5 d. which he confess'd to be part of my money. I took up Hails in Drury-lane, but he did not confess any thing. He had 7 s. and some half pence about him.

            . I am wife to 
               
                  James 
                  Pratt 
               



            , the prosecutor lodged in my two pair of stairs room, and the master of 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lee 
               



            , named Padget, had the upper part of my house. 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lee 
               



             had lodg'd with me four months. He came to my house on the 18th day of July, Hails came with him, and they went into the garret as I thought to work; they staid there about half an hour. 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Lee 
               



             came down to me on the ground floor, and staid with me about a quarter of an hour, then he went up again, and might stay there about a quarter of an hour, then they both came down. I am a little deaf, and Lee kept me in discourse, so that if Hails came down to the prosecutor's room, I could not hear him. 
               
                  Charles

             swore d - n his soul when he came in he would have money before he went out of the house, which I understood to be by working and earning it; they had work'd together about a fortnight.

            . Mr. Coine brought me a warrant, I being a constable; I took Lee in Golden-Lane, that is all I know.
Lee's Defence.
I know nothing of it.
Hails's Defence.
I had work'd with Lee about a fortnight that day I was in the house. Lee owes me money, and I said I would have money before I went out of the house; that was at going out, not coming in.

            .
Hails 

               acquitted

WILLIAM BAKER
 (City police-constable, No, 132.) Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning on the 23rd of August, I saw a mob—I ran up and the prosecutor had the prisoner in his custody—the prosecutor had this handkerchief, which I now produce, in his hand.





THOMAS POWELL
. I am a linen-draper. I was in Barbican, and had this handkerchief in my pocket—I did not feel it taken, but a witness told me of it—I seized the prisoner, and took it from his trowsers.

Prisoner. I did not have it, I will be on my oath.





RACHEL TWEEDALE
. I was in Barbican—I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, put it into his own pocket, and cross to the other side—I called the prosecutor.

            . On the 29th of June, the prisoner came to pledge two hats with me: I live at the bottom of Wood-street, near Cripplegate. I examined the hats, and said I did not like them; he took them from the counter. Some few minutes after, a woman on the opposite side the street came and told me a man had stole a hat that was near my door, and ran up Wood-street; I ran up to him and laid hold of him, and desired him to walk back: as I was coming back, a woman told me she saw him put a hat down a cellar window; which we found in the cellar; it was my property, and was in my shop before he came in.

            . I saw the prisoner take a hat from the prosecutor's door, from off a nail, and go away with it; he had two others in his hand at the time; I went and told the prosecutor of it.

            . I was with the prosecutor when he took the prisoner; I saw him drop one hat down the cellar window, which the prosecutor owned.

Mr. Flude did not approve of taking in these hats: as to taking any other, I know nothing about it.

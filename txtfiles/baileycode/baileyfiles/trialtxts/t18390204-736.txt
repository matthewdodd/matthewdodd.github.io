ROBERT SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
24th of January, 1 time-piece, value 2l., the goods of 



John Westaway.






EDWIN WESTAWAY
. I live with my father, John Westaway, in Gower-street North—he is a watch-maker. On Thursday night, the 24th of January, I was in the parlour, and saw somebody stepping out of the shop—I told my brother, and he went out.





HENRY WESTAWAY
. I was told of this by my brother, and missed a time-piece from a stand in front of the shop, near the door—I saw the prisoner go off the step of the door, and throw the time-piece against the chapel—I pursued, and took him—I had not lost sight of him at all.

Prisoner. When he overtook me in Euston-square, he said, "Tell me where the property is, and I will not prosecute you." Witness. No, I did not—when I took him, he said, "Pray don't—pray don't"—I said, "Pray don't what?" and the officer came and took him.





JOHN WESTAWAY
. This time-piece was on a stand in my shop—it had been left me to repair.





JOHN ROUSE
 (police-constable E 24.) I was on duty, and took the prisoner.

Prisoner. I hope you will recommend me to mercy.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.


Transported for Seven Years.

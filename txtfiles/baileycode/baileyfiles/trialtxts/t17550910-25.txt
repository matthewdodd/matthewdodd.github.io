; the prisoner came into my shop and asked to see some check. I shew'd her a piece of check. Then she said she would not have an apron, she would have a pair of stockings ; she looked at some, but she shuffled about. I had a parcel of goods that lay tumbled about, having been shewing them to a customer. I thought she did not come to buy, and I told her so, and bid her go away; she went away; I stept to my door, and about two doors from mine she droped a piece of eight handkerchiefs. She strove to conceal them. I went and brought her back; then she dropt two more parcels of two different sorts of pieces of 16 handkerchiefs more, (produced in court and deposed to.) I did not see her. take them .

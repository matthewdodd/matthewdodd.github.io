            . The prisoner at the bar was my servant
, I suspected her because she went out the same day I took a warrant for her, and had her before justice Fielding. She was discharged the next morning. The spoon was stopt, and advertised with three letters for the owner of it to come and describe it, &c. I went and told the letters, and saw it; it was my property. (Produced in court and deposed to.) Also another spoon marked as that was which the prosecutor deposed to. They were both marked by his own brother.
John Alison. I am servant to Mr. Johnson a pawnbroker at the corner of Russel Court. On the 29th of May the prisoner came and offered this spoon to pledge with me, I having took in things before of her at different times; I stopped it; soon after it was advertised the prosecutor came and owned it.
Prisoner's Defence.
My master took me before justice Fielding, he cleared me and ordered him to pay me my wages; he tendered it down; I would not take it, but insisted on a month's wages; after that he took me up again. I know nothing of it.

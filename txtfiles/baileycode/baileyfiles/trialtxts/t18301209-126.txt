            . I am a Police-constable. On the 12th of November, in the evening, I was in Old Church-street, Paddington - I saw some suspicious characters, and concealed myself opposite to where this linen was hanging - I saw the two prisoners get up to the line - they took this article, and jumped down; I followed, and took them about forty yards from the spot - I am not sure, but I believe Littleton had it; I took them to the station, and found on Littleton two skeleton-keys and one latch-key.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Littleton put in a written Defence, stating that none of the property was found on him, and declaring his innocence.

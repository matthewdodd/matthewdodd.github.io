            . I live in Conduit-street, Hanover-square, and keep a hosier's and haberdasher's shop; on the 29th of September, about two o'clock, as I was at dinner with my son and daughter in a back room, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, there were 6 pair of stockings which I left on the counter, and three yards of black ribband, three pair of which she took away with the ribband.

            . I saw the prisoner in the shop, and went out into the shop; and then went to call my sister, the prisoner was gone then; my sister look'd and missed three pair of stockings and the black ribband; so I went out after the prisoner, I saw her make a stop, and when she saw me coming she dropped the ribband, but the stockings she held under her arm.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

            . I keep the Saracen's Head Inn, in the parish of St. Catharine Cree Church




. On the 25th of October, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner took a lodging at my house for the night, and said she was going by one of the coaches. She slept in a single-bedded room, No. 23-the bed was in a proper state the day before. I went into the room immediately after she came down, and found the bed very deficient in feathers as well as the bolster. As the servants said she appeared bulky, I stopped her, told her she had my property, and requested she would give it up. After some time, she gave me two bags of feathers, which were slung round her, before and behind-the feathers weighted 25lbs. The ticking had been ripped up, and sewed up again with different thread.
JAMES HARGRAVE. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody, and found forty-seven duplicates, eleven keys, a needle, and some white thread on her.

            . Aged 46.




               Transported for Seven Years

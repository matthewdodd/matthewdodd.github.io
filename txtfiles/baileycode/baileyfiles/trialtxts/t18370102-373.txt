WILLIAM THOMAS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of December, I looking glass and frame, value 5l., the goods of 



George Griffiths and another.






GEORGE GRIFFITHS
. I live in Waterloo-bridge-road, and am a carver and gilder. On the 21st of December this looking-glass and frame were safe in my shop—I missed it between half-past six and seven o'clock—I found the prisoner with it the next day at Bow-street—I know nothing of him—this is the glass.





FRANCIS MORRIS
. I am a mariner. On the 21st of December I saw the prisoner, about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening, abreast of Son Chapel, in the Waterloo-road, three hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop—he was carrying this glass on his shoulder, and fell down—I assisted him up, and asked where he was going—he said over Waterloobridge; and if I would carry it for him he would give me 1s.—I carried it for him, as he was a little intoxicated—when I got over he had to go further, and then we paraded up several streets, down to Turnstile; I was still carrying the glass, and saw him take two books; I saw a policeman and gave him in charge, with the books on him—he had a white apron on—I thought he was in the trade.





JAMES VICKERY
 (police-constable F 26.)I saw Morris carrying this glass, and the prisoner was before him—Morris told me to follow him, as he had some suspicions that the glass he was carrying was not right, and he had seen the person who hired him to carry it steal two books—I took the prisoner, and found these books under his coat, and then took the glass.

Prisoner. I am an umbrella-maker. I was in Tottenham Court-road, trying to get work—I am innocent of this crime—as to the books, I turned

up a yard, and there were the books lying; I took them up, and the officer took me.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

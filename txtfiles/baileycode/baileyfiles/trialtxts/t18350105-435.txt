CATHERINE KENNEY
 and 




ELIZABETH WATKINS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
2nd of January, 1 table-cloth, value 12s., the goods of 



Henry Gibbs; and that Kenney had been before convicted of felony.






ANN GIBBS
. I am the wife of Henry Gibbs—we live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. I sell toys—on the 2nd of January, between twelve and one o'clock, the two prisoners came to my shop—Watkins asked for a little dessert dish—I said I had not got one—she said she was sure she saw one in the window, and would show me where it was—Kenney stood by her side—I went to the window, expecting Watkins would show me where it was, but she did not—I then turned, and Kenney was gone—I missed this table-cloth, which had been on the side counter—it is mine, and is marked "H. A. G."—Watkins left without buying any thing.





EDWARD JONES
 (police-sergeant D 10.) About ten minutes before two o'clock that day, I saw the prisoners passing through Harrow-street, Lisson-grove—Kenney had something under her shawl—I stopped them, and took this cloth from her.





THOMAS FRANKLIN
. I produce the certificate of Kenney's former conviction—(read)—I know her to be the person.

KENNEY—

. Aged 16.—

JOSEPH ROWNSON
. I am an ironmonger, and live on Bennet's-hill. In consequence of information. I accompanied an officer to the prisoner Smith's house on Peter's-hill, Paul's-wharf—his house joins mine—I lost the articles stated in the indictment between the 20th of December and the time of their being found—I had them in my possession on the 20th of December, and was present when they were found between the floor

and ceiling, under Kew's bed, in the prisoner Smith's house—Smith was present—he said he was sure there was nothing under the bed—the officers insisted on turning up the bed, and then he said, "Turn it up," which he did, and found a loose board, under which we found the property—Smith occupied two rooms below—the officer were about searching the room at the time I got there—I had been watching on the roof, suspecting some stolen property would be brought over there—I saw no resistance on his part when he saw the officers were determined to turn the bed up—I cannot say he was privy to the robbery—all I know is, the property was stolen by sweeps coming over the tiles—Kew is Smith's son-in-law, and has lived with him some years.
